She definitely wasn\u2019t going to argue, especially after such an exhausting night. She had smiled at her daughter, then vowed to never let her forget that Mommy spent twelve hours in labor.</p><p>She is <i>so </i>small. Pink. It doesn\u2019t feel real, seeing her swaddled up behind the glass. But that little girl is <i>his. </i>The tiniest little thing, only five pounds and five ounces, but she\u2019s his little girl. <i>His whole heart and soul.</i></p><!-- more --><p>Tony feels a hand on his shoulder. Rhodey smiles when he sees pink blankets and full, dark hair. Even at first glance, he can tell which one\u2019s Tony\u2019s girl.</p><p>\u201cMan, she\u2019s got your hair, too.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfect,\u201d Tony breathes.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Rhodey replies,\u00a0\u201cwhen do I get to hold little Miss Morgan?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWait your turn, Honeybear, I haven\u2019t even gotten to holding her yet.\u201d<br/></p><p>Rhodey laughs, pulling his best friend into a hug. Tony can\u2019t stop smiling, so much so that his cheeks hurt. It is the happiest day of his life.\u00a0</p><p>Later in the night, Tony returns to Pepper, crawling beside her in the hospital bed. Their bodies melt into each other, and Pepper sighs in content when she feels Tony\u2019s arms wrap around her. He presses a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cShe is beautiful, Pep.\u201d He can barely hold back tears at this point (Rhodey had to stop him from crying outside the nursery, too). \u201cGod, you did amazing.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI guess I did a pretty good job.\u201d She winks, laughing to see her husband rolling her eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>They lay in silence for a while, with Tony absentmindedly running his fingers through the golden strands of Pepper\u2019s hair. There\u2019s a bit of twisting in his stomach, and his fiddling with his glasses for a while. Pepper squeezes his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony swallows thickly.\u00a0\u201cI need to be perfect for her. I\u2019m <i>not </i>messing this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be perfect, you just need to be there for her. The rest will fall into place.\u201d She kisses his forehead.\u00a0\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be there.\u201d Tony lays back down, letting Pepper rest on his chest and fall asleep again. He spends the entire night thinking about Morgan.<br/></p><p>~</p><p>\u201cOkay, little miss. I\u2019m begging you, please keep those stats up for the car seat test. I\u2019ll buy you a brand new car if you do.\u201d<br/></p><p>Pepper shakes her head as she packs her duffel.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t keep promising her these things. She\u2019ll be spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep, you\u2019re making us lose focus.\u201d Tony returns his gaze to the child, whose bright eyes aren\u2019t exactly focusing on him or anything in particular.\u00a0\u201cOkay. Good heart rate, right?. Keep breathin\u2019, okay? Stay focused.\u201d<br/></p><p>The nurse chuckles a little as she places the child in the car seat. Ninety minutes seems to last ages, and all Tony can do is sit and watch her.\u00a0</p><p>Her hair somehow seems longer in the week they\u2019ve been at the hospital. He is absolutely obsessed with her hair, how long it already is. He makes a mental note to go shopping for clips and ribbons when they go home.</p><p>Morgan is wearing an adorable pink onesie that Happy picked up from the gift store.\u00a0\u201cDaddy\u2019s girl\u201d written in bright lettering, and Tony took about a million pictures of the her wearing it. The onesie was adorable earlier, but now all he can focus on is the rising and falling of her chest. Her breathing is supposed to be normal for ninety minutes, and if she can\u2019t do it, they have to wait another day.</p><p>She\u2019s tiny, but she\u2019s strong. Before Tony even realizes, ninety minutes pass. He has to force himself to breathe again. It is a relief. His baby is going home with him. He can barely contain his excitement in getting the car seat set up. He presses his lips to Pepper\u2019s, giddy like a kid in a candy store.\u00a0</p><p>The days only get happier and happier.</p><p>~</p><p>Miss Morgan H. Stark is perfect. Every time Tony thinks he can\u2019t love her anymore, she proves him wrong every single time.</p><p>The first month, Tony barely sleeps. He and Pepper are supposed to be on rotation for sleeping, but he can\u2019t resist sneaking into the nursery to see what she\u2019s doing. Every single move, every single little gurgle or smile, every time she blinks, he doesn\u2019t want to miss it.</p><p>His phone is filled with the same sets of photos. His favorites are Pepper and Morgan together, with the child laying on her mother\u2019s chest. It looks like a painting, something that should be hung up in the Louvre. He takes twenty more pictures with different angles, just to keep the memory safe.</p><p>Two months into the routine now, Tony thinks he has it down. He doesn\u2019t mind losing some sleep\u2014hell, he was doing it all the time before Morgan or Pepper. But somehow, laying on the couch with Morgan laying across his chest, he can feel the fatigue finally setting in.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY,\u201d Tony calls out,\u00a0\u201cset a timer for&hellip; 10 minutes.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWould you like to me call Ms. Potts, boss?\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony adjusts himself so that Morgan is safely in his arms before settling down and closing his eyes.\u00a0\u201cNo, no, this is her scheduled sleeping time. I just need to, uh, close my eyes. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>Morgan babbles unintelligibly, and Tony chuckles a little.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t want me to sleep, huh? You\u2019re pretty selfish, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>The child giggles slightly at the sound of her father\u2019s voice, only further warming Tony\u2019s heart. The man sits up a bit, holding her up to his gaze.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re too silly. This is a no-nonsense area. Your mom is the CEO of Stark Industries, kid. You can\u2019t mess around in this place.\u201d</p><p>Morgan is giggling uncontrollably now as her father makes ridiculous faces and carries her around the living room, rambling about her mother and her status at Stark Industries. Her tiny little fingers grip on Tony\u2019s glasses as he speaks, but he doesn\u2019t mind. Pepper can\u2019t hide the smile on her face when she wakes up and sees the two brunettes pacing around the penthouse together.</p><p>Every day is perfect.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cAlright, little miss. You got the standing part.\u201d Rhodey stands next to Morgan, feet lined up together.\u00a0\u201cAfter this, it\u2019s easy. One step after another.\u201d<br/></p><p>Morgan gazes up at the lieutenant, brows furrowed together in confusion. Rhodey gestures to Tony and Pepper, who are just across the way at the couch. Tony\u2019s got special glasses today, eagerly recording every second of his daughter\u2019s first steps. He made sure to design them in time to get high quality footage, knowing that he\u2019s going to watch this every day for a month.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMom and Pops are waiting for you kid.\u201d Rhodey offers his hand.\u00a0\u201cWanna give it a try with Uncle Honeybear?\u201d<br/></p><p>Morgan smiles, taking his hand. Rhodey stands behind her, taking both her hands as they slowly make their way across the room. Slow and steady, she makes her way, tiny steps growing more confident as she lets go of Rhodey\u2019s hands and pauses.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone in the penthouse holds their breath.\u00a0</p><p>Morgan confidently steps forward, stumbling only slightly before finally reaching her parents, who are already cheering. Tony throws Morgan on his shoulders, running around the penthouse in celebration.\u00a0</p><p>The video of Morgan goes viral, and the happy family goes out for ice cream. Tony and Pepper can\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>~</p><p>Pepper loves how eager Tony is to give Morgan what she wants. Snacks? Always prepared. Toys? An endless supply. He can\u2019t help it; the toddler has him wrapped around her chubby little fingers.</p><p>Despite all this, she\u2019s a little hesitant to leave them alone for a weekend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a phone call away,\u201d Pepper reminds Tony as she packs her bags,\u00a0\u201cSeriously, one call and I\u2019ll be back here\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony scoffs.\u00a0\u201cSweetheart, we will be okay. I promise. Have you no faith in us?\u201d</p><p>Pepper rolls her eyes, kissing both of her favorite brunettes on the forehead.\u00a0\u201cBe good. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>Morgan giggles softly, reaching out to her mother for extra kisses. Pepper can\u2019t resist, taking the child into her arms and squeezing tight. She whispers something into Morgan\u2019s ear, and now both of them giggling suspiciously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, secrets aren\u2019t allowed in this house.\u201d Tony wraps his arms around both of them.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a final around of hugs and kisses before Pepper has to rush out the door, leaving the mischievous duo alone. Morgan eagerly runs to her room, pulling her father behind her. She leads him to the table, and Tony joins stuffed animals and action figures for tea time.</p><p>\u201cPinky up,\u201d Morgan reminds Tony. She pokes his hand, and Tony gasps.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Princess Morgan.\u201d He hangs his head in shame.\u00a0\u201cCan you forgive your old man?\u201d<br/></p><p>Morgan giggles and pours him another cup of tea.\u00a0\u201cSilly, silly, silly.\u201d</p><p>Tony can\u2019t help but smile. She is absolutely perfect.</p><p>~</p><p>It\u2019s late at night in the lab, but Tony tinkers away anyway. The clock reads 3:45 AM, and he can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019s eaten. He steps out of the lab trying to be as quiet as possible as he moves across the house. His heart nearly stops to see Morgan sitting at the counter in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cShit\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>Morgan laughs.\u00a0\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now. Only mommy and daddy can say that.\u201d<br/></p><p>This only sparks a mischievous look in her eyes.\u00a0\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles and sighs, sitting down next to her at the counter.\u00a0\u201cYou better have a good explanation for being up at 4AM, little miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d Morgan insists,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to fix that, huh?\u201d Tony starts pulling ingredients from the fridge. The child looks curiously at the variety of food. Tony starts whisking eggs, milk, and flour together, and Morgan grabs chocolate chips from the cupboard.</p><p>The pre-schooler is too short to see over the counter, so Tony grabs a stool for her. He kisses her forehead, brushing her hair out of the way so she can pour chocolate chips into the pancake mix. Knowing that he won\u2019t say no, she pours <i>way </i>too many chocolate chips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna give your old man diabetes,\u201d Tony says, nudging her a little,\u00a0\u201cdon\u2019t you care about my health?\u201d<br/></p><p>Morgan giggles.\u00a0\u201cI can eat them all then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, little miss.\u201d<br/></p><p>Making the pancake mix is easy. But they\u2019re so full of chocolate chips, a little too big since they\u2019re both hungry, so the kitchen is a bit of a mess by the time there are any successful pancakes made. Morgan doesn\u2019t mind, happily eating pancakes that are far too sweet for a pre-schooler to be having in the middle of the night. But Tony can\u2019t resist that smile, so she can have all the chocolate chips she wants.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty good, right?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI think Mommy makes better pancakes.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony\u2019s incredulous.\u00a0\u201cI put like, half a pound of chocolate in these pancakes, and you\u2019re telling me Mommy\u2019s are better?\u201d</p><p>Morgan braces herself for Tony to scoop her up and bring her to her room, tickling her until she\u2019s breathless. Despite the sugar, her eyes are heavy from the food and being tucked into bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright. It\u2019s bed time for real now.\u201d Tony kisses her forehead.\u00a0\u201cYou better get to bed real quick. Your mom\u2019s gonna kick my you-know-what if she knows how much chocolate I just fed you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy,\u201d Morgan insists with a yawn,\u00a0\u201cI mean it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care if you\u2019re not tired, go to bed.\u201d Tony tucks her stuffed animals beside her.\u00a0\u201cEven your toys are tired.\u201d<br/></p><p>He\u2019s about to leave the room when Morgan reaches for his hand.\u00a0\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, buttercup?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI love you three thousand.\u201d She squeezes his hand. Her little fingers grip his own, and it takes a minute for him to respond. His heart is fucking bursting.<br/></p><p>\u201cThree thousand, huh?\u201d He squeezes her hand back.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s <i>crazy</i>. Tell you what, I love you even more.\u201d<br/></p><p>Morgan giggles, which is even more adorable now that her eyes are heavy and the squeeze on his fingers is getting fainter. He presses his lips to her forehead one more time.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers, even though she\u2019s sleeping now,\u00a0\u201cI love you three thousand.\u201d<br/></p><p>And he does. He loves her three thousand, three million, three fucking <i>billion.\u00a0</i></p><hr><p>if you\u2019d like to be tagged in tony fics or just any of my fics in general, <b><a href=\"http://tonysangels.tumblr.com/ask\">send me an ask!</a></b></p>",

Ninety minutes seems to last ages, and all Tony can do is sit and watch her.\u00a0</p><p>Her hair somehow seems longer in the week they\u2019ve been at the hospital.

He doesn\u2019t mind losing some sleep\u2014hell, he was doing it all the time before Morgan or Pepper. But somehow, laying on the couch with Morgan laying across his chest, he can feel the fatigue finally setting in.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY,\u201d Tony calls out,\u00a0\u201cset a timer for\u2026 10 minutes.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWould you like to me call Ms. Potts, boss?\u201d<br></p><p>Tony adjusts himself so that Morgan is safely in his arms before settling down and closing his eyes.\u00a0\u201cNo, no, this is her scheduled sleeping time. I just need to, uh, close my eyes. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>Morgan babbles unintelligibly, and Tony chuckles a little.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t want me to sleep, huh? You\u2019re pretty selfish, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>The child giggles slightly at the sound of her father\u2019s voice, only further warming Tony\u2019s heart. The man sits up a bit, holding her up to his gaze.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re too silly. This is a no-nonsense area. Your mom is the CEO of Stark Industries, kid. You can\u2019t mess around in this place.\u201d</p><p>Morgan is giggling uncontrollably now as her father makes ridiculous faces and carries her around the living room, rambling about her mother and her status at Stark Industries. Her tiny little fingers grip on Tony\u2019s glasses as he speaks, but he doesn\u2019t mind. Pepper can\u2019t hide the smile on her face when she wakes up and sees the two brunettes pacing around the penthouse together.</p><p>Every day is perfect.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cAlright, little miss. You got the standing part.\u201d Rhodey stands next to Morgan, feet lined up together.\u00a0\u201cAfter this, it\u2019s easy. One step after another.\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan gazes up at the lieutenant, brows furrowed together in confusion. Rhodey gestures to Tony and Pepper, who are just across the way at the couch. Tony\u2019s got special glasses today, eagerly recording every second of his daughter\u2019s first steps. He made sure to design them in time to get high quality footage, knowing that he\u2019s going to watch this every day for a month.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMom and Pops are waiting for you kid.\u201d Rhodey offers his hand.\u00a0\u201cWanna give it a try with Uncle Honeybear?\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan smiles, taking his hand. Rhodey stands behind her, taking both her hands as they slowly make their way across the room. Slow and steady, she makes her way, tiny steps growing more confident as she lets go of Rhodey\u2019s hands and pauses.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone in the penthouse holds their breath.\u00a0</p><p>Morgan confidently steps forward, stumbling only slightly before finally reaching her parents, who are already cheering. Tony throws Morgan on his shoulders, running around the penthouse in celebration.\u00a0</p><p>The video of Morgan goes viral, and the happy family goes out for ice cream. Tony and Pepper can\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>~</p><p>Pepper loves how eager Tony is to give Morgan what she wants. Snacks? Always prepared. Toys? An endless supply. He can\u2019t help it; the toddler has him wrapped around her chubby little fingers.</p><p>Despite all this, she\u2019s a little hesitant to leave them alone for a weekend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a phone call away,\u201d Pepper reminds Tony as she packs her bags,\u00a0\u201cSeriously, one call and I\u2019ll be back here\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>Tony scoffs.\u00a0\u201cSweetheart, we will be okay. I promise. Have you no faith in us?\u201d</p><p>Pepper rolls her eyes, kissing both of her favorite brunettes on the forehead.\u00a0\u201cBe good. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>Morgan giggles softly, reaching out to her mother for extra kisses. Pepper can\u2019t resist, taking the child into her arms and squeezing tight. She whispers something into Morgan\u2019s ear, and now both of them giggling suspiciously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, secrets aren\u2019t allowed in this house.\u201d Tony wraps his arms around both of them.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a final around of hugs and kisses before Pepper has to rush out the door, leaving the mischievous duo alone. Morgan eagerly runs to her room, pulling her father behind her. She leads him to the table, and Tony joins stuffed animals and action figures for tea time.</p><p>\u201cPinky up,\u201d Morgan reminds Tony. She pokes his hand, and Tony gasps.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Princess Morgan.\u201d He hangs his head in shame.\u00a0\u201cCan you forgive your old man?\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan giggles and pours him another cup of tea.\u00a0\u201cSilly, silly, silly.\u201d</p><p>Tony can\u2019t help but smile. She is absolutely perfect.</p><p>~</p><p>It\u2019s late at night in the lab, but Tony tinkers away anyway. The clock reads 3:45 AM, and he can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019s eaten. He steps out of the lab trying to be as quiet as possible as he moves across the house. His heart nearly stops to see Morgan sitting at the counter in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cShit\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan laughs.\u00a0\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now. Only mommy and daddy can say that.\u201d<br></p><p>This only sparks a mischievous look in her eyes.\u00a0\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles and sighs, sitting down next to her at the counter.\u00a0\u201cYou better have a good explanation for being up at 4AM, little miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d Morgan insists,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to fix that, huh?\u201d Tony starts pulling ingredients from the fridge. The child looks curiously at the variety of food. Tony starts whisking eggs, milk, and flour together, and Morgan grabs chocolate chips from the cupboard.</p><p>The pre-schooler is too short to see over the counter, so Tony grabs a stool for her. He kisses her forehead, brushing her hair out of the way so she can pour chocolate chips into the pancake mix. Knowing that he won\u2019t say no, she pours <i>way </i>too many chocolate chips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna give your old man diabetes,\u201d Tony says, nudging her a little,\u00a0\u201cdon\u2019t you care about my health?\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan giggles.\u00a0\u201cI can eat them all then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, little miss.\u201d<br></p><p>Making the pancake mix is easy. But they\u2019re so full of chocolate chips, a little too big since they\u2019re both hungry, so the kitchen is a bit of a mess by the time there are any successful pancakes made. Morgan doesn\u2019t mind, happily eating pancakes that are far too sweet for a pre-schooler to be having in the middle of the night. But Tony can\u2019t resist that smile, so she can have all the chocolate chips she wants.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty good, right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI think Mommy makes better pancakes.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony\u2019s incredulous.\u00a0\u201cI put like, half a pound of chocolate in these pancakes, and you\u2019re telling me Mommy\u2019s are better?\u201d</p><p>Morgan braces herself for Tony to scoop her up and bring her to her room, tickling her until she\u2019s breathless. Despite the sugar, her eyes are heavy from the food and being tucked into bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright. It\u2019s bed time for real now.\u201d Tony kisses her forehead.\u00a0\u201cYou better get to bed real quick. Your mom\u2019s gonna kick my you-know-what if she knows how much chocolate I just fed you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy,\u201d Morgan insists with a yawn,\u00a0\u201cI mean it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care if you\u2019re not tired, go to bed.\u201d Tony tucks her stuffed animals beside her.\u00a0\u201cEven your toys are tired.\u201d<br></p><p>He\u2019s about to leave the room when Morgan reaches for his hand.\u00a0\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, buttercup?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI love you three thousand.\u201d She squeezes his hand. Her little fingers grip his own, and it takes a minute for him to respond. His heart is fucking bursting.<br></p><p>\u201cThree thousand, huh?\u201d He squeezes her hand back.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s <i>crazy</i>. Tell you what, I love you even more.\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan giggles, which is even more adorable now that her eyes are heavy and the squeeze on his fingers is getting fainter. He presses his lips to her forehead one more time.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers, even though she\u2019s sleeping now,\u00a0\u201cI love you three thousand.\u201d<br></p><p>And he does. He loves her three thousand, three million, three fucking <i>billion.\u00a0</i></p><hr><p>if you\u2019d like to be tagged in tony fics or just any of my fics in general, <b><a href=\"http://tonysangels.tumblr.com/ask\">send me an ask!</a></b></p></p>",

I just need to, uh, close my eyes. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>Morgan babbles unintelligibly, and Tony chuckles a little.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t want me to sleep, huh? You\u2019re pretty selfish, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>The child giggles slightly at the sound of her father\u2019s voice, only further warming Tony\u2019s heart. The man sits up a bit, holding her up to his gaze.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re too silly. This is a no-nonsense area. Your mom is the CEO of Stark Industries, kid. You can\u2019t mess around in this place.\u201d</p><p>Morgan is giggling uncontrollably now as her father makes ridiculous faces and carries her around the living room, rambling about her mother and her status at Stark Industries. Her tiny little fingers grip on Tony\u2019s glasses as he speaks, but he doesn\u2019t mind. Pepper can\u2019t hide the smile on her face when she wakes up and sees the two brunettes pacing around the penthouse together.</p><p>Every day is perfect.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cAlright, little miss. You got the standing part.\u201d Rhodey stands next to Morgan, feet lined up together.\u00a0\u201cAfter this, it\u2019s easy. One step after another.\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan gazes up at the lieutenant, brows furrowed together in confusion. Rhodey gestures to Tony and Pepper, who are just across the way at the couch. Tony\u2019s got special glasses today, eagerly recording every second of his daughter\u2019s first steps. He made sure to design them in time to get high quality footage, knowing that he\u2019s going to watch this every day for a month.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMom and Pops are waiting for you kid.\u201d Rhodey offers his hand.\u00a0\u201cWanna give it a try with Uncle Honeybear?\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan smiles, taking his hand. Rhodey stands behind her, taking both her hands as they slowly make their way across the room. Slow and steady, she makes her way, tiny steps growing more confident as she lets go of Rhodey\u2019s hands and pauses.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone in the penthouse holds their breath.\u00a0</p><p>Morgan confidently steps forward, stumbling only slightly before finally reaching her parents, who are already cheering. Tony throws Morgan on his shoulders, running around the penthouse in celebration.\u00a0</p><p>The video of Morgan goes viral, and the happy family goes out for ice cream. Tony and Pepper can\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>~</p><p>Pepper loves how eager Tony is to give Morgan what she wants. Snacks? Always prepared. Toys? An endless supply. He can\u2019t help it; the toddler has him wrapped around her chubby little fingers.</p><p>Despite all this, she\u2019s a little hesitant to leave them alone for a weekend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a phone call away,\u201d Pepper reminds Tony as she packs her bags,\u00a0\u201cSeriously, one call and I\u2019ll be back here\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>Tony scoffs.\u00a0\u201cSweetheart, we will be okay. I promise. Have you no faith in us?\u201d</p><p>Pepper rolls her eyes, kissing both of her favorite brunettes on the forehead.\u00a0\u201cBe good. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>Morgan giggles softly, reaching out to her mother for extra kisses. Pepper can\u2019t resist, taking the child into her arms and squeezing tight. She whispers something into Morgan\u2019s ear, and now both of them giggling suspiciously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, secrets aren\u2019t allowed in this house.\u201d Tony wraps his arms around both of them.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a final around of hugs and kisses before Pepper has to rush out the door, leaving the mischievous duo alone. Morgan eagerly runs to her room, pulling her father behind her. She leads him to the table, and Tony joins stuffed animals and action figures for tea time.</p><p>\u201cPinky up,\u201d Morgan reminds Tony. She pokes his hand, and Tony gasps.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Princess Morgan.\u201d He hangs his head in shame.\u00a0\u201cCan you forgive your old man?\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan giggles and pours him another cup of tea.\u00a0\u201cSilly, silly, silly.\u201d</p><p>Tony can\u2019t help but smile. She is absolutely perfect.</p><p>~</p><p>It\u2019s late at night in the lab, but Tony tinkers away anyway. The clock reads 3:45 AM, and he can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019s eaten. He steps out of the lab trying to be as quiet as possible as he moves across the house. His heart nearly stops to see Morgan sitting at the counter in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cShit\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan laughs.\u00a0\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now. Only mommy and daddy can say that.\u201d<br></p><p>This only sparks a mischievous look in her eyes.\u00a0\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles and sighs, sitting down next to her at the counter.\u00a0\u201cYou better have a good explanation for being up at 4AM, little miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d Morgan insists,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to fix that, huh?\u201d Tony starts pulling ingredients from the fridge. The child looks curiously at the variety of food. Tony starts whisking eggs, milk, and flour together, and Morgan grabs chocolate chips from the cupboard.</p><p>The pre-schooler is too short to see over the counter, so Tony grabs a stool for her. He kisses her forehead, brushing her hair out of the way so she can pour chocolate chips into the pancake mix. Knowing that he won\u2019t say no, she pours <i>way </i>too many chocolate chips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna give your old man diabetes,\u201d Tony says, nudging her a little,\u00a0\u201cdon\u2019t you care about my health?\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan giggles.\u00a0\u201cI can eat them all then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, little miss.\u201d<br></p><p>Making the pancake mix is easy. But they\u2019re so full of chocolate chips, a little too big since they\u2019re both hungry, so the kitchen is a bit of a mess by the time there are any successful pancakes made. Morgan doesn\u2019t mind, happily eating pancakes that are far too sweet for a pre-schooler to be having in the middle of the night. But Tony can\u2019t resist that smile, so she can have all the chocolate chips she wants.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty good, right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI think Mommy makes better pancakes.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony\u2019s incredulous.\u00a0\u201cI put like, half a pound of chocolate in these pancakes, and you\u2019re telling me Mommy\u2019s are better?\u201d</p><p>Morgan braces herself for Tony to scoop her up and bring her to her room, tickling her until she\u2019s breathless. Despite the sugar, her eyes are heavy from the food and being tucked into bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright. It\u2019s bed time for real now.\u201d Tony kisses her forehead.\u00a0\u201cYou better get to bed real quick. Your mom\u2019s gonna kick my you-know-what if she knows how much chocolate I just fed you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy,\u201d Morgan insists with a yawn,\u00a0\u201cI mean it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care if you\u2019re not tired, go to bed.\u201d Tony tucks her stuffed animals beside her.\u00a0\u201cEven your toys are tired.\u201d<br></p><p>He\u2019s about to leave the room when Morgan reaches for his hand.\u00a0\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, buttercup?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI love you three thousand.\u201d She squeezes his hand. Her little fingers grip his own, and it takes a minute for him to respond. His heart is fucking bursting.<br></p><p>\u201cThree thousand, huh?\u201d He squeezes her hand back.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s <i>crazy</i>. Tell you what, I love you even more.\u201d<br></p><p>Morgan giggles, which is even more adorable now that her eyes are heavy and the squeeze on his fingers is getting fainter. He presses his lips to her forehead one more time.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers, even though she\u2019s sleeping now,\u00a0\u201cI love you three thousand.\u201d<br></p><p>And he does.

She definitely wasn&rsquo;t going to argue, especially after such an exhausting night. She had smiled at her daughter, then vowed to never let her forget that Mommy spent twelve hours in labor.</p><p>She is <i>so </i>small. Pink. It doesn&rsquo;t feel real, seeing her swaddled up behind the glass. But that little girl is <i>his. </i>The tiniest little thing, only five pounds and five ounces, but she&rsquo;s his little girl. <i>His whole heart and soul.</i></p><p>Tony feels a hand on his shoulder. Rhodey smiles when he sees pink blankets and full, dark hair. Even at first glance, he can tell which one&rsquo;s Tony&rsquo;s girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Man, she&rsquo;s got your hair, too.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s perfect,&rdquo; Tony breathes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; Rhodey replies,&nbsp;&ldquo;when do I get to hold little Miss Morgan?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait your turn, Honeybear, I haven&rsquo;t even gotten to holding her yet.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Rhodey laughs, pulling his best friend into a hug. Tony can&rsquo;t stop smiling, so much so that his cheeks hurt. It is the happiest day of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Later in the night, Tony returns to Pepper, crawling beside her in the hospital bed. Their bodies melt into each other, and Pepper sighs in content when she feels Tony&rsquo;s arms wrap around her. He presses a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;She is beautiful, Pep.&rdquo; He can barely hold back tears at this point (Rhodey had to stop him from crying outside the nursery, too). &ldquo;God, you did amazing.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I guess I did a pretty good job.&rdquo; She winks, laughing to see her husband rolling her eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>They lay in silence for a while, with Tony absentmindedly running his fingers through the golden strands of Pepper&rsquo;s hair. There&rsquo;s a bit of twisting in his stomach, and his fiddling with his glasses for a while. Pepper squeezes his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be okay.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony swallows thickly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need to be perfect for her. I&rsquo;m <i>not </i>messing this up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be perfect, you just need to be there for her. The rest will fall into place.&rdquo; She kisses his forehead.&nbsp;&ldquo;Promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will be there.&rdquo; Tony lays back down, letting Pepper rest on his chest and fall asleep again. He spends the entire night thinking about Morgan.<br /></p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, little miss. I&rsquo;m begging you, please keep those stats up for the car seat test. I&rsquo;ll buy you a brand new car if you do.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Pepper shakes her head as she packs her duffel.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep promising her these things. She&rsquo;ll be spoiled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pep, you&rsquo;re making us lose focus.&rdquo; Tony returns his gaze to the child, whose bright eyes aren&rsquo;t exactly focusing on him or anything in particular.&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. Good heart rate, right?. Keep breathin&rsquo;, okay? Stay focused.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The nurse chuckles a little as she places the child in the car seat. Ninety minutes seems to last ages, and all Tony can do is sit and watch her.&nbsp;</p><p>Her hair somehow seems longer in the week they&rsquo;ve been at the hospital. He is absolutely obsessed with her hair, how long it already is. He makes a mental note to go shopping for clips and ribbons when they go home.</p><p>Morgan is wearing an adorable pink onesie that Happy picked up from the gift store.&nbsp;&ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s girl&rdquo; written in bright lettering, and Tony took about a million pictures of the her wearing it. The onesie was adorable earlier, but now all he can focus on is the rising and falling of her chest. Her breathing is supposed to be normal for ninety minutes, and if she can&rsquo;t do it, they have to wait another day.</p><p>She&rsquo;s tiny, but she&rsquo;s strong. Before Tony even realizes, ninety minutes pass. He has to force himself to breathe again. It is a relief. His baby is going home with him. He can barely contain his excitement in getting the car seat set up. He presses his lips to Pepper&rsquo;s, giddy like a kid in a candy store.&nbsp;</p><p>The days only get happier and happier.</p><p>~</p><p>Miss Morgan H. Stark is perfect. Every time Tony thinks he can&rsquo;t love her anymore, she proves him wrong every single time.</p><p>The first month, Tony barely sleeps. He and Pepper are supposed to be on rotation for sleeping, but he can&rsquo;t resist sneaking into the nursery to see what she&rsquo;s doing. Every single move, every single little gurgle or smile, every time she blinks, he doesn&rsquo;t want to miss it.</p><p>His phone is filled with the same sets of photos. His favorites are Pepper and Morgan together, with the child laying on her mother&rsquo;s chest. It looks like a painting, something that should be hung up in the Louvre. He takes twenty more pictures with different angles, just to keep the memory safe.</p><p>Two months into the routine now, Tony thinks he has it down. He doesn&rsquo;t mind losing some sleep&mdash;hell, he was doing it all the time before Morgan or Pepper. But somehow, laying on the couch with Morgan laying across his chest, he can feel the fatigue finally setting in.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY,&rdquo; Tony calls out,&nbsp;&ldquo;set a timer for&hellip; 10 minutes.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to me call Ms. Potts, boss?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony adjusts himself so that Morgan is safely in his arms before settling down and closing his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no, this is her scheduled sleeping time.
