You&rsquo;re just so fucking <i>busy&ndash; </i>Constantly smothered with assignment after assignment, and with your terrible time management skills, you&rsquo;re always rushing to get things done just in the nick of time. It&rsquo;s because of this that you&rsquo;re constantly playing a catch-up game that saps up any free time you might <i>possibly</i> have. You&rsquo;re usually crammed in your apartment because of this and a lot of the time your head is a mess of formulas you don&rsquo;t care for and poets you can&rsquo;t care to remember. But <i>this </i>week is <i>different.</i></p><!-- more --><p>Lately, you&rsquo;ve taken on a new regimen when you work on your assignments and it keeps you focused enough to get your work together without the distractions. You&rsquo;ve been doing so well as of late that you&rsquo;ve<i> </i><i><i>finally </i></i>had some time where instead of hunching over a desk full of papers, you&rsquo;re just chilling out without a single educational thing on your mind. It&rsquo;s peaceful, really. So when your close friend Jungkook hits you up one day, practically <i>begging </i>you to spend some time at his place, you&rsquo;re happy to say that you can agree without much of a regret in doing so.</p><p>The drive down is long, but you&rsquo;re anxious to see Jungkook as well as his roommates, which happen to be more friends of yours. You live far from them all and you longed to see them for ages now, so to say you are excited it an understatement. As you drive, you can practically hear Jungkook&rsquo;s teasing quips and remarks now&ndash; He always had a stupidly sharp tongue and a mouth that moved faster than his god damn brain, so the bullshit that flies from his mouth is&hellip; <i>Interesting,</i> to say the least.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s Jimin, the demonic entity you&rsquo;ve had the absolute pleasure and displeasure of knowing. He&rsquo;s crazy intelligent, but underhanded all the same&ndash; You can still remember that one time he nearly dragged you into a robbery. He had it all planned out, all wrapped up in a pretty red bow and with those cute, plump lips of his and that easy going smile, you could&rsquo;ve fallen for it. His plan, he admitted later when it all fell through, was for you to be the getaway driver for another person who would do the actual robbery and it <i>could&rsquo;ve</i> worked if you didn&rsquo;t know him so well&hellip;</p><p>Of course, you kinda knew what was up since you&rsquo;ve done something similar among many, <i><i>many</i></i><i> </i>other things. You try not to think about that part in your life much. Between the near fucking deaths and necromancy, you really were an entirely different person compared to who you are now. It&rsquo;s growth, really.</p><p>You&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll see Taehyung, too, yet another creative character. He&rsquo;s an art major as well a self-proclaimed artistic genius and intellectual even though he borderline fails every single fuckin class besides those pertaining to art. He really is a wonder when it comes down to it, though, and in more ways than one. One time he was failing literature and managed to dig up enough dirt on his <i>married</i> literature teacher&rsquo;s affair with yet <i>another</i> teacher that she had literally no other option than to boost Taehyung&rsquo;s grade up to an A. It lasted for the entire year, too, and then when Taehyung changed courses he snitched anyway. When you asked him about it he just said something along the lines of &ldquo;she earned it&rdquo; and nothing else at all on the matter ever again, so yeah. That&rsquo;s Kim Taehyung.</p><p>When you finally pull into the parking lot of their apartment complex and park, you&rsquo;re exhausted. Ravenous, too&ndash; Your dumb ass forgot to eat before you left, of all things, and you know once Jungkook finds out about that as well as you&rsquo;re rather<i> </i><i><i>unstable</i></i> eating habits, he&rsquo;ll probably have a knife to your neck and spoon feed you himself. You wouldn&rsquo;t mind it much, though, because that&rsquo;s the way Jungkook is and how he expresses affection. Also&hellip; you wouldn&rsquo;t mind him waiting on you hand and foot to cater to you. In fact, you might just fuck around and collapse as soon as you step into the apartment just so he can do exactly that&hellip; Fuck yeah.</p><p>You hop out of the car, rolling your neck and shoulders. Your muscles pop as you dig out your phone, pulling up Jungkook&rsquo;s number to shoot him a text.</p><p>&ldquo;hey&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;im outside&rdquo;</p><p>You begin typing your third text message, but by the time you get to the word <i>my </i>of &ldquo;help me get <i>my</i> bags out the car&rdquo; you can hear the sound of a door flying open somewhere and a loud, cheery voice absolutely <i>screaming</i>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S MY <i>FUCKING</i> GIRL!&rdquo;</p><p>With his arms outstretched wide and a cheeky, blinding grin, you look up to see Jungkook standing at the doorway of a nearby unit. You grin, chuckling lightly as you throw up your hand in a wave. He&rsquo;s so happy, <i>so</i><i><i>,</i></i><i> </i><i><i>so </i></i>happy that he doesn&rsquo;t even realize the glass screen door is swinging back until it hits him.</p><p><i>Literally</i>&hellip;</p><p>Hits him.</p><p>It swings back into his face hard enough for him to flinch as the sound of glass hitting skin rings clear and he loses his balance, fucking collapsing right then and there. You flinch yourself at the impact and cringe.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Ah,&rdquo;</p><p>You mumble it aloud softly as you slowly drop your arm. Looks like Jungkook still has that clumsy, awkward phase going on. It&rsquo;s cute, yeah. In a sad sort of way.</p><p>You see Jimin appear behind the door, see him staring down at his roommate with an almost tired look. Jungkook raises his arm up as if asking for Jimin&rsquo;s help and to your very little surprise, Jimin just fucking steps over Jungkook&rsquo;s body and out the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n!&rdquo; Jimin calls, hopping down the steps with graceful, vigorous movements, glancing up between you and the stairs beneath his feet as if the interaction with Jungkook never happened.</p><p>Soon he touches the ground and dashes up to you with rushed movements, but the sight of the male has you borderline swooning. Jimin is utterly, wholly, entirely <i><i>adorable</i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i> The way the sun is shining down, beams of light kissing his honey cheeks and staining his skin in its healing light, his dark eyes like crescents, arms out wide, he looks like a devious little angel&ndash; You don&rsquo;t know whether to be scared or happy to see his dangerously pretty ass. In the next moment, Jimin is slinging his arms around you before you can decide which part of your fight or flight response you want to utilize and <i><i>christ</i></i><i> </i>is his hug tight&ndash; <i>Bone</i> <i>crushing,</i> honestly. Still, he smells like pancakes and warm syrup, like all the good things you adore. Like home, really. As your arms wrap around the male in return, you almost feel like you&rsquo;re safe in his grasp.</p><p><i>&hellip;Almost.</i><br/>You know damn well never to <i>totally </i>let your guard down around that demon.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh <i>god, </i>Y/n, it&rsquo;s been so long,&rdquo; He pulls away to look you over, &ldquo;&hellip;How are you? Are you well? Ahh&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>His hands suddenly grip your cheeks and turns your head from side to side hard enough for your damn neck to pop.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh goodness, your skin is&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He pauses, milky eyes gazing into your own for a moment. You can feel yourself burning by the second because he&rsquo;s staring at you so fucking intently, until&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, your skin is <i>really</i> dried out. Do you even moisturize? Do you just rub fucking acid on your face? What the fuck?&rdquo; He squints, lips parting, <i>&ldquo;&hellip;Why is it so dry&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>See?<br/>This is why you have trust issues with Park Jimin&ndash; It&rsquo;s always some sneaky, underhanded bullshit with him.</p><p>He twists your head a couple more times, your neck pops, and it takes you physical effort to keep from swinging on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Aight, aight. I get it my face is ugly, jesus christ,&rdquo; You grab his hands and jerk them off of your skin, &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t just say <i>hey</i> like a regular person, Park?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; Jimin starts, cocking a brow. He wiggles his hands until he holds your own, &ldquo;Never said you&rsquo;re ugly. You&rsquo;re the prettiest girl in the whole wide world, Petunia~&rdquo;</p><p>His tone turns flirtatiously melodic and your groan with a roll of your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I see the months apart haven&rsquo;t changed <i>that </i>part of you,&rdquo; You mumble.</p><p>&ldquo;What part?&rdquo; Counters Jimin with enthusiastic defiance, perking up, &ldquo;The part of me that still feels nothin&rsquo; but a&ndash; a <i>burning</i> desire to be with you? The part of me that <i>wants</i> you!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god&ndash; <i>Jimin,&rdquo;</i> You hiss with a scowl, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that so loudly. It&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re really a bit embarrassed because he&rsquo;s borderline yelling and it doesn&rsquo;t help <i>at </i><i><i>all </i></i>that you can see an older African lady on her porch watching the two of you from a distance. She looks almost disgusted, kinda, but you get it. For some reason, you have the feeling if you saw a scene like the one you&rsquo;re currently in, you&rsquo;d be disgusted too.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Jimin replies, leaning against your car as he eases closer to you, &ldquo;Embarrassed, Petunia?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More like disgusted,&rdquo; You remark with a snarl to your lips and a gag to punctuate your words. You spin around, ignoring Jimin&rsquo;s immediate pout when you&rsquo;re no longer within flirting range. You walk to the other side of the car, pull open the door, grab your purse off the floor of the back seat, and gesture rather vaguely to the rest as Jimin approaches.</p><p>&ldquo;Help me get my bags out the car and invite me in already,&rdquo; You ask&ndash; No, <i>demand,</i> &ldquo;A certain bitch is tired, her back hurts, and if she doesn&rsquo;t get <i>something</i> in her guts soon, her stomach is just gonna start eating away at itself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could put something in your guts now,&rdquo; Jimin says with a smug smile and coy shrug, &ldquo;If you want it. No cooking required&ndash; I could have you satisfied in seconds, Petunia.&rdquo;</p><p>You glance him over, brows raised. Your expression is almost impressed, honestly. Jimin is beginning to feel flushed with pride at his little remark when your brain shuts down and you fucking reply with a genuine&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck, you carry a Snickers on you?&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s face drops, &ldquo;W&hellip; Wait, what&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I have it?&rdquo; You go on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fucking starving. I think if I don&rsquo;t eat soon my organs are gonna shut down or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin pauses.</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh. That wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; what I meant,&rdquo; He shifts from foot to foot, your oblivious expression only making things worse.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I was talking about my di&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby!&rdquo;</p><p>You gasp, wind entirely knocked out of you when strong arms suddenly wrap around your form. He squeezes you tightly from behind, but it feels more like you&rsquo;re being attacked than affectionately hugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh <i>FUCK, </i>Jungkook!&rdquo; You screech when you realize it&rsquo;s him, &ldquo;You scared the shit outta me&ndash; Hey, get off! I can&rsquo;t breathe!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry&ndash;&rdquo; Jungkook mumbles, but he hesitates a moment before finally pulling away.</p><p>You turn to look at him with a playful glare, punching his chest lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re still the same clumsy motherfucker, huh?&rdquo; You tease, punching him again as your glare turns into a grin, &ldquo;What was that up there at the balcony? You were practically sucker punched by a fucking door, you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s rude to say when you only <i>just </i>got here,&rdquo; Jungkook whines, shoving you back in your shoulder, &ldquo;I got hurt saying hi to <i>you </i>so <i>technically</i> it&rsquo;s <i>your</i> fault I&rsquo;m hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nuh uh!&rdquo; You exclaim, slamming your palms into his chest, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the clumsy jackass so it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> my fault.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;</i> He shoves you back, &ldquo;It is, <i>too,</i> your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is <i>not!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;It is, <i>too!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Is not!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is, too!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is n&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>But before you can finish, Jimin clamps his hand over your mouth and exhaustedly says, &ldquo;You both sound like two full-fledged fucking fools, I swear to god. Can we go inside already?&rdquo;</p><p>You and Jungkook glance back at him, a pout on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; You huff, ripping Jimin&rsquo;s hand away from your face.</p><p>You step aside, letting Jimin and Jungkook get your two suitcases for you. It&rsquo;s when the three of you are walking toward the apartment with Jimin leading the way, you whisper hotly&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is <i>not, </i>Jeon Jungkook, <i>my</i> <i>fault.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Just for extra measure, you dig your fingers into Jungkook&rsquo;s waist and smile smugly when he squirms under your touch. The three of you walk closer still until Jimin pauses just before the stairs. You know him so well&ndash; <i>So </i>extremely well that when his plump lips part and a dazzling grin graces his handsome face, when he respectfully dips his head toward the African woman on her porch, you know almost instantaneously that he&rsquo;s forcing it. And Jungkook, too, is forcing his smile as he bows lightly toward the woman. Really, they both look&hellip; <i>Nervous. </i>You&rsquo;re intrigued.</p><p>Jimin starts first.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, bibi&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>And all it takes is for her to say those four words for Park Jimin to shut his fucking mouth. You watch as he leans back, chewing his inner cheek as he nods pointlessly, a defeated expression on his face. Even Jungkook looks like he&rsquo;s been silenced and he never even said anything. You&rsquo;re amazed, honestly. Clearly, this woman commands a lot of respect already&ndash; You can tell by the way her plump lips stay in a tight line, how her dark eyes are so focused and how her gaze is strict, as if she takes <b><i>zero</i></b> bullshit. Really, its like she can see right through Jungkook and Jimin. Or maybe they just <i>really </i>pissed her off. Could be both, though.</p><p>&hellip;It&rsquo;s <i>probably</i> both.</p><p>&ldquo;That your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; You reply, a bit surprised when she suddenly addresses you. She looks just as powerful when she glares at you and you suddenly feel as meek as Jungkook and Jimin.</p><p>&ldquo;Your boyfriend,&rdquo; She asks again, but it&rsquo;s much less like a question and much more like a demand. She nods her head at Jimin and you jump, finally getting her question.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; You exclaim, scrambling for words as you wave your hands dismissively, &ldquo;No, Jimin and I, we, uh, we&rsquo;re just&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s your boyfriend, you should know he cheating on you,&rdquo; She announces immediately.</p><p>You <i>would</i> guess you took too long to answer her and that&rsquo;s why she phrased it that way <i>if </i>it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that she just said what she said. You stutter in your words, broken syllables falling from your lips as you quickly turn to look at Jimin. He looks caught and the funny part about it is that the two of you aren&rsquo;t even dating.</p><p>Jimin, embarrassed, scrambles for an explanation as he glances between you, Jungkook, and finally to Bibi.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, no, <i>bibi,&rdquo;</i> he chuckles nervously, &ldquo;Y/n and I aren&rsquo;t&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been livin&rsquo; here for fourteen years and in the last few months these children have been here, I&rsquo;ve seen every kind of girl you can imagine in and out that apartment. Its either you&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; &lsquo;round or you <i>must</i> be trying to raise an orphanage, cuz this is the sixth girl ive seen you with this week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin, oh my god&hellip;&quot;You mumble, <i>barely </i>keeping in your laughter. You fake like you&rsquo;re shocked, cupping your hand over your mouth. Then, in a twisted sort of way, you say, &quot;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re <i>cheating</i> on me&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/n&ndash;&rdquo;</i> Jimin hisses, fucking exhausted. His eyes flare with a warning when he glares at you, but it&rsquo;s not like his three-foot tall self could beat your ass anyway, so the chances of you actually stopping are <i>very </i>low.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened, Jimin?&rdquo; You go on, faking total shock, &ldquo;In the parking lot just now, you were just talking about the part of you that still feels a <i>burning</i> <i>desire</i> to be with me? What happened to the part of you that <i>wants</i> me!?&rdquo;</p><p>You swear you see Jimin&rsquo;s eye twitch and you <i>know </i>for an absolute, complete <i>fact </i>he is already thinking of ways to get you back. He&rsquo;s probably considering lighting your precious clothes on fire which, by the way, is something he <i>has </i>done to you before. To which you responded by nearly setting the hay atop his head that he <i>claims </i>to be hair on fire. And you would&rsquo;ve fucking done it, too, but then his last roommate, a tall, giraffe legged motherfucker, grabbed you and you ended up fighting the <i>roommate</i> instead. Long story short, Jimin wound up completely physically fine and the only person who got hurt was his previous roommate, Namjoon, who ended with a black eye and then moved out. It worked in your favor though, because Jimin was so strapped on cash for <i><i>months</i></i><i> </i>afterward trying to pay for that whole apartment by himself that you felt like you&rsquo;d still gotten your revenge.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, bibi, we aren&rsquo;t <i>really</i> dating,&rdquo; Jimin tries to speak calmly.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Bibi cocks a brow, &ldquo;You lied when you told me your girlfriend was coming to town.&rdquo;</p><p>You snort audibly, but Bibi&rsquo;s quick glance has you shutting your big mouth. You mumble an apology, but really you&rsquo;re just <i>amazed </i>at how fucking <i>delusional</i> Jimin is as well as how&hellip; <i>blunt</i> Bibi is. Jimin lies and tells her you&rsquo;re his girlfriend stopping by for a visit, then Bibi, apparently aware of all the other girls Jimin&rsquo;s been fucking or whatever, tattles on him the <i>second </i>you arrive. It&rsquo;s fucking comical, honestly, but you must admit, you&rsquo;re starting to like this fierce old woman.</p><p>Jimin cringes, then drops his head and nods, &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Bibi just looks at him for a moment, her brows furrowed and lips parted in disgust, nearly. She then shakes her head and mumbles something, then waves Jimin off. She doesn&rsquo;t even need to say anything else, Jimin just murmurs a &ldquo;Goodbye, Bibi,&rdquo; and then rushes up the rest of the steps into the apartment. Bibi glances at Jungkook too, and Jungkook awkwardly follows in Jimin&rsquo;s steps and starts to leave. You&rsquo;re about to say bye and part ways as well when Bibi stops you. She holds up her hand to get your attention and you freeze.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; You tilt your head at her, &ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>She looks you over, as if deciding whether or not you&rsquo;re worth her breath, and then says&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sleep with that boy. The girl he was with yesterday had crabs.&rdquo;</p><p>And then she gets up and walks inside of her apartment, the door banging shut behind her.</p><p>You just stand there for a moment, your mouth agape until you hear Jungkook&rsquo;s voice call out to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n! Are you almost done talking to Bibi? I cooked and I really want us to sit down and eat together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; You turn and look up at Jungkook&rsquo;s expectant face. It takes you a split second to register Jungkook&rsquo;s words because Bibi&rsquo;s are still ringing in your ears, but you eventually do and nod.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-Yeah,&rdquo; You mumble, shaking your head as if to snap back into your normal self before Jungkook gets suspicious.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m, uh. Comin&rsquo; up now.&rdquo;</p><p>And then you grin.<br/>And it&rsquo;s fake.<br/>&hellip;And Jungkook can tell your grin is fake as hell, but he doesn&rsquo;t say anything when you make your way up and enter the apartment.</p><p>The place is neat and tidy. <i>Homey. </i>White walls peppered with photo after photo of Jungkook and Jimin together, of each of them separately, of Taehyung, and of Jimin and Jungkook&rsquo;s family as well. The furniture is worn, but far from decayed. It is comfortably warm inside as well but the heat is mostly stemming from the kitchen. Jimin, who watches you taking everything in with an attentively curious gaze, tugs on your jacket until you follow along and shrug it off of your shoulders. He hangs it up for you and as he does, you slip off into the kitchen. You pause, leaning against the wall for a moment to deeply inhale the scent from within. It&rsquo;s savory and sweet all at once, enough to have your stomach whining and mouthwatering. The sound of a spoon tapping against a pot calls you back to earth and you open your eyes to see Jungkook stirring the food.</p><p>&ldquo;I.. cooked a lot,&rdquo; He announces softly. <i>Embarrassed</i> is what he sounds like, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how much you would eat or what you even preferred, so I kind of got carried away.&rdquo;</p><p>He grins sheepishly, then turns to glance up at you, &ldquo;You <i>will</i> eat&hellip; right?&rdquo;</p><p>You gaze at him for a moment, then grin, a wave of adoration hitting you that makes you want to pinch his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. I could eat all this&ndash;&rdquo; You make a wide, general gesture out toward the kitchen, &ldquo;&ndash;And then some.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Jungkook exclaims.</p><p>By the soft flush to his cheeks and the way he gracefully checks the oven, he&rsquo;s clearly satisfied with your answer. But because you just <i>have </i>to fuck with people, you clear your throat and say&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Or not.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook freezes.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know~,&rdquo; You stretch flippantly, movements flamboyant and overdramatic, &ldquo;I might not <i>actually</i> be able to eat all of this after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Wait, no, why not?&rdquo; Jungkook presses, letting go of the spoon and leaving it in the pot. He looks distressed and you <i>know </i>you&rsquo;re being mean but you also&hellip; Don&rsquo;t care enough to stop. Besides, after all the times Jungkook teased <i>you </i>over shit, revenge is only necessary, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Are you not hungry? Or something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no. I&rsquo;m plenty hungry,&rdquo; You turn around, cross your hands behind your back and deliberately edge away from him, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook steps closer, tilting his head.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Just?&rdquo;</i> He urges.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the last time I checked, your cooking was&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>But your teasing quip is cut short when you suddenly hear a slightly feminine voice call out a groggy&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with all the noise? This is the second time you &rsquo;ve woken me up on one of my off days,&rdquo; She calls, her words tired and slurred with an accent you know well&ndash; Better than well, actually, its a sound burned into your very <i>soul</i> at this point.</p><p>You hear Jimin start to respond to her, but you&rsquo;re already in motion. You rush out of the kitchen, almost tripping as you round the corner until suddenly you see her physically before you. And there, just down the hall, is where she stands&ndash; In clear view is no one else besides Min Yoonji. Her jet black locks are silken and messy all the same, strands sticking out here and there. Those familiar dark eyes of hers are tired&ndash; <i><i>Hazy</i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i><i> </i>Her tone is sun-kissed yet so <i>pale</i> all at once, its as if she&rsquo;s fallen ill&hellip; Not like the Yoonji you once knew years back who&rsquo;s skin was as vibrant as&ndash; No, <i>rivaled with</i> a freshly bloomed flower. The woman is dressed in a long black tee that stops just above her knees, black socks on her feet, black bags under her eyes to match her atmosphere. It&rsquo;s a concoction of feelings that <i>rush </i>you when you see her, two of them very prominent all the same. One emotion is <i>pure,</i> <i>honest,</i> <i>childish</i> joy that stems from the very pit of your being the <i>moment </i>you lay eyes on her figure.</p><p>The second?</p><p>&hellip;Fear.</p><p>The last time you checked, Min Yoonji&ndash; <i>your </i>Min Yoonji did <i>not </i>look the way <i>this </i>Min Yoonji looks now. Staring at her sleek frame, her exhausted movements, you know she&rsquo;s changed and it&rsquo;s nowhere near for the better.</p><p>But you swallow it down, push that fear from your mind the moment you notice it and instead fall into excitement.</p><p>Yoonji looks&hellip; Shocked when she sees you. Her jaw falls slack, eyes blinking again and again as she gazes at you with hard, confused eyes. She even points at you, lips struggling to find words for a moment until all she says is&ndash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jimin just giggles, grinning, &ldquo;Y/n&rsquo;s stopping by for a visit,&rdquo; He explains simply.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here for the next few days,&rdquo; Jungkook continues seamlessly as he too appears from the kitchen, a towel in his grasp that he dries his hands on, &ldquo;We agreed not to tell you because Y/n wanted to surprise you.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Surpriseee~&rdquo;</i> You call, waving your hands like it&rsquo;s some big reveal, the cheekiest of grins on your face.</p><p>Yoonji&rsquo;s lips part and shut until finally, she finds a way to express her utter bewilderment and excitement. She rushes forward and you meet her halfway as she practically throws herself into your arms. You gasp when her chest slams into your own, stumbling back again as her arms wrap around your neck. Her grip is tight, her face nuzzled into your neck as quick, slurred comments on how much she&rsquo;s fucking missed you fall from her lips. You giggle, squeezing her terribly skinny frame back, but in all honesty, she&rsquo;s grown so <i>thin </i>you almost worry that you&rsquo;ll snap her in half if you squeeze her even the slightest bit too hard.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;</b></i><i><i><b>God,</b></i></i><i><i> I </i></i><i><i><i>missed </i></i></i><i><i><i><i>you&hellip;&rdquo; </i></i></i></i>Yoonji hisses the words in your ear, her nails digging into your flesh.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you, tooooo!&rdquo; You whine back, rocking the two of you from side to side.</p><p>In all honesty, the hug is far too short, but you and Min Yoonji are well aware of Jimin and Jungkook who stand closely behind. So you part ways just as quickly as you begin and suppress your feelings for now.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so nice to be with you all again,&rdquo; You remark, glancing at Jungkook&rsquo;s glimmering smile, Jimin&rsquo;s flushed cheeks, and then a quick glance at Yoonji&rsquo;s lips before you turn back to the boys, &ldquo;If I could be here all the time, I would&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should, then!&rdquo; Jimin exclaims, suddenly grabbing you by your hands and pulling toward the kitchen table, &ldquo;Stay with us! We&rsquo;d make some room for you!&rdquo;</p><p>Yoonji smirks, following along, &ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;d kick Jungkook&rsquo;s ass out and you can take his room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heeey!&rdquo;<i> </i>Jungkook retorts, glaring at your Yoonji, &ldquo;Why do <i>I </i>get kicked out? Why not Jimin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I can stand Jimin a <i>little </i>bit more than I can stand <i>you&ndash;&rdquo;</i></p><p>And then she jabs her pointed finger into Jungkook&rsquo;s chest for extra measure. The male whines, clutching his injured chest and you giggle at the sight. Still bickering and fussing as always&ndash; They really never changed. But the lack of change in your dynamic is warming, all the same. Even after leaving for months, you can still come home to the people you love and feel nothing but comfort.</p><p>The four of you take your seats at the roundtable, Yoonji on your left, Jungook on your right, and Jimin across. When Jungkook slips into the kitchen to make the plates of food, he calls Jimin in for his help. It&rsquo;s after the shorter male shoots you one of his dazzling smiles, sticks his tongue out at Yoonji, then dips off into the kitchen, you feel her hand come to squeeze your thigh. You catch her gaze for a moment, eyes hooded as you take in her form. Yoonji&rsquo;s face rests in her left hand as she gazes at you with soft eyes, blinking with the slow, carefulness of a feline. A million emotions stir within her shimmering gaze and you wonder how it is <i>possible </i>for one person to carry stars in their eyes. You gaze down at her hand, at the bony joints and slender fingers that clutch the plump flesh of your thigh. Her hands have always been big, and you&rsquo;ve always loved the way they look wrapped around your own, how they feel when they clutch your cheeks&hellip;</p><p>You laugh then when you feel the urge to kiss her hit you strong and you&rsquo;re suddenly too embarrassed to even look at her anymore. Your skin, soft and supple, <i>burns </i>where her palm lingers&ndash; <i>Taunting </i>you with the sensation. Far too long has it been since the two of you seen each other last, and now that the two of you are finally together, holding back for the sake of Jimin and Jungkook is borderline hellish. The two of you are lesbians, after all, <i>closeted </i>lesbians, and neither one of you are ready to come out. Even with the two boys, there is always that fear that you&rsquo;ll be looked at <i>differently </i>for admitting to being lovers&ndash; It already didn&rsquo;t go well with either one of your parents. Yoonji&rsquo;s momma practically disowned her when Yoonji came out to her some years ago, and your mother <i>claims</i> she doesn&rsquo;t think of you any differently now, but you <i>know </i>she does. So after coming out to people who claimed to love you unconditionally only to run head-first into a condition, why risk it again?</p><p>These thoughts swim in your mind, a mixture of sadness and bitterness accompanying them. Your mood shifts and Yoonji knows it does&ndash; It&rsquo;s like she can read the very hazy, fearful words on your mind despite you having said nothing. Her grip on your thigh tightens until you turn to look at her, and its like she can hear every little thought running through your head. She blinks and there&rsquo;s a little bit more <i>focus </i>and <i>anxiety </i>in her gaze, mixing in with her adoration towards you.</p><p><i>&ldquo;</i><i><i>It&rsquo;s</i></i><i><i><i> </i></i></i><i><i><i><i>okay</i></i></i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i><i>&rdquo;</i></p><p>It the words that her little lips silently whisper when they part and suddenly you feel like everything <i>is </i>okay again. That&rsquo;s the power of Min Yoonji&ndash; Better yet, it just may be the power that coexists between two lovers, but you know Yoonji would tease you for saying something as cheesy as that. So, with the suddenness of rain on a sunny day, you&rsquo;re fine again.<br/>For now, at least.</p><p>Jungkook and Jimin return and Yoonji&rsquo;s hand falls from your thigh with slickness and ease that has you wishing it was back again. But you&rsquo;re thankful for it all the same because Jungkook and Jimin are utterly clueless to it. Dishes clatter and empty stomachs sing as the tantalizing scent of food harass each of you. You sing your compliments to Jungkook, to which he beams brighter than the sun in response to. Then eagerly, you devour the meal before you, joyful conversation filling the air as a sense of peace befalls you.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a happy, pleasant atmosphere that lingers during the meal, after it is over, when you all watch a movie together, and then finally when the sun gives her final goodbyes and leaves with her lover, Moon, taking her place with grace and class. Jungkook and Jimin apologize and excuse themselves to their room since they both have early shifts the next day, hug and pepper your cheeks in playfully sloppy kisses (an action to which you notice Yoonji dislikes, you see it in the way her eyes slide to the side, how her gaze dims, how her hands tighten) and then suddenly, its only you and Yoonji.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll be sleeping in her room for the next bit you&rsquo;re here and honestly, the arrangement is perfect for the two of you. Into her room you and she go, the door clicking softly shut behind you. You pause, turning back to lock the door and as you do, you can feel Yoonji hovering near. She&rsquo;s always been <i>hot</i>&ndash; Temperature-wise, that is. So when her warm hands clutch your cool arms, when soft, heated lips press themselves to the back of your icy neck, and when a soft groan falls from her lips and makes the hair on your entire being stand up, you freeze. You soak it in, soak in the way it feels so familiar to have her pressing against you like this. Her hands drop to your hips as she practically pins you against the door, a sigh dripping from you like sap from a tree. You feel like you are burning as you manage to turn around, meeting your lovers gaze with unsteady eyes. She&rsquo;s closer now, closer for you to look at and you see it clear as day.</p><p><i>She is not well.</i></p><p>Yoonji, oblivious, leans forward on the tips of her toes and attempts to kiss you, but you stop her when your hands suddenly clutch her cheeks. She freezes, her head laying heavy in your grip. You almost can&rsquo;t believe it, the dramatic change that your girl has gone through, but you know trauma changes a person. So you pull her close and run your fingers through her hair, plant a kiss to her cheek, then softly whisper&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoonji hesitates but pulls back to stare you in your eyes. She inches out of your grip and you notice her fear.</p><p>&ldquo;Are&hellip; Are we breaking up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; You say, an airy, lifeless, laugh with your words, &ldquo;But this <i>is</i> about you, baby&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You slide past, taking a seat on the edge of her bed and patting the space next to you. Yoonji follows obediently, sitting so close her thigh touches yours. You grab her hands and hold them in your own, staring at the veins pumping blood beneath the flesh. You&rsquo;ve always loved those hands of hers, they&rsquo;re probably your favorite trait on her besides her, well&hellip; Her everything. You plant kisses to the tips of each finger until you&rsquo;ve done all ten, until you realize Yoonji&rsquo;s eyes are glazed over like she&rsquo;s a million miles away or like she may even pass out right then and there. You snap your own fingers and she clicks back into awareness so suddenly that it frightens you.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Yoonji asks as if nothing happened, imploring you to reply and finally talk, &ldquo;Cat got your tongue?&rdquo;</p><p>She means it as a joke but you can&rsquo;t even fake a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Yoonji,&rdquo; You start softly, &ldquo;How are you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You pause, take in a deep breath to halt the stinging of tears in your eyes, then force out the words.</p><p><i>&ldquo;How have you been since Yoongi and Hoseok died?&rdquo;</i></p><p>It&rsquo;s a question Yoonji doesn&rsquo;t know how to answer.<br/></p>",

You\u2019re just so fucking <i>busy\u2013 </i>Constantly smothered with assignment after assignment, and with your terrible time management skills, you\u2019re always rushing to get things done just in the nick of time. It\u2019s because of this that you\u2019re constantly playing a catch-up game that saps up any free time you might <i>possibly</i> have. You\u2019re usually crammed in your apartment because of this and a lot of the time your head is a mess of formulas you don\u2019t care for and poets you can\u2019t care to remember. But <i>this </i>week is <i>different.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Lately, you\u2019ve taken on a new regimen when you work on your assignments and it keeps you focused enough to get your work together without the distractions. You\u2019ve been doing so well as of late that you\u2019ve<i> </i><i><i>finally </i></i>had some time where instead of hunching over a desk full of papers, you\u2019re just chilling out without a single educational thing on your mind. It\u2019s peaceful, really. So when your close friend Jungkook hits you up one day, practically <i>begging </i>you to spend some time at his place, you\u2019re happy to say that you can agree without much of a regret in doing so.</p><p>The drive down is long, but you\u2019re anxious to see Jungkook as well as his roommates, which happen to be more friends of yours. You live far from them all and you longed to see them for ages now, so to say you are excited it an understatement. As you drive, you can practically hear Jungkook\u2019s teasing quips and remarks now\u2013 He always had a stupidly sharp tongue and a mouth that moved faster than his god damn brain, so the bullshit that flies from his mouth is\u2026 <i>Interesting,</i> to say the least.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Jimin, the demonic entity you\u2019ve had the absolute pleasure and displeasure of knowing. He\u2019s crazy intelligent, but underhanded all the same\u2013 You can still remember that one time he nearly dragged you into a robbery. He had it all planned out, all wrapped up in a pretty red bow and with those cute, plump lips of his and that easy going smile, you could\u2019ve fallen for it. His plan, he admitted later when it all fell through, was for you to be the getaway driver for another person who would do the actual robbery and it <i>could\u2019ve</i> worked if you didn\u2019t know him so well\u2026</p><p>Of course, you kinda knew what was up since you\u2019ve done something similar among many, <i><i>many</i></i><i> </i>other things. You try not to think about that part in your life much. Between the near fucking deaths and necromancy, you really were an entirely different person compared to who you are now. It\u2019s growth, really.</p><p>You\u2019re sure you\u2019ll see Taehyung, too, yet another creative character. He\u2019s an art major as well a self-proclaimed artistic genius and intellectual even though he borderline fails every single fuckin class besides those pertaining to art. He really is a wonder when it comes down to it, though, and in more ways than one. One time he was failing literature and managed to dig up enough dirt on his <i>married</i> literature teacher\u2019s affair with yet <i>another</i> teacher that she had literally no other option than to boost Taehyung\u2019s grade up to an A. It lasted for the entire year, too, and then when Taehyung changed courses he snitched anyway. When you asked him about it he just said something along the lines of \u201cshe earned it\u201d and nothing else at all on the matter ever again, so yeah. That\u2019s Kim Taehyung.</p><p>When you finally pull into the parking lot of their apartment complex and park, you\u2019re exhausted. Ravenous, too\u2013 Your dumb ass forgot to eat before you left, of all things, and you know once Jungkook finds out about that as well as you\u2019re rather<i> </i><i><i>unstable</i></i> eating habits, he\u2019ll probably have a knife to your neck and spoon feed you himself. You wouldn\u2019t mind it much, though, because that\u2019s the way Jungkook is and how he expresses affection. Also\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t mind him waiting on you hand and foot to cater to you. In fact, you might just fuck around and collapse as soon as you step into the apartment just so he can do exactly that\u2026 Fuck yeah.</p><p>You hop out of the car, rolling your neck and shoulders. Your muscles pop as you dig out your phone, pulling up Jungkook\u2019s number to shoot him a text.</p><p>\u201chey\u201d<br>\u201cim outside\u201d</p><p>You begin typing your third text message, but by the time you get to the word <i>my </i>of \u201chelp me get <i>my</i> bags out the car\u201d you can hear the sound of a door flying open somewhere and a loud, cheery voice absolutely <i>screaming</i>\u2013</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S MY <i>FUCKING</i> GIRL!\u201d</p><p>With his arms outstretched wide and a cheeky, blinding grin, you look up to see Jungkook standing at the doorway of a nearby unit. You grin, chuckling lightly as you throw up your hand in a wave. He\u2019s so happy, <i>so</i><i><i>,</i></i><i> </i><i><i>so </i></i>happy that he doesn\u2019t even realize the glass screen door is swinging back until it hits him.</p><p><i>Literally</i>\u2026</p><p>Hits him.</p><p>It swings back into his face hard enough for him to flinch as the sound of glass hitting skin rings clear and he loses his balance, fucking collapsing right then and there. You flinch yourself at the impact and cringe.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Ah,\u201d</p><p>You mumble it aloud softly as you slowly drop your arm. Looks like Jungkook still has that clumsy, awkward phase going on. It\u2019s cute, yeah. In a sad sort of way.</p><p>You see Jimin appear behind the door, see him staring down at his roommate with an almost tired look. Jungkook raises his arm up as if asking for Jimin\u2019s help and to your very little surprise, Jimin just fucking steps over Jungkook\u2019s body and out the door.</p><p>\u201cY/n!\u201d Jimin calls, hopping down the steps with graceful, vigorous movements, glancing up between you and the stairs beneath his feet as if the interaction with Jungkook never happened.</p><p>Soon he touches the ground and dashes up to you with rushed movements, but the sight of the male has you borderline swooning. Jimin is utterly, wholly, entirely <i><i>adorable</i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i> The way the sun is shining down, beams of light kissing his honey cheeks and staining his skin in its healing light, his dark eyes like crescents, arms out wide, he looks like a devious little angel\u2013 You don\u2019t know whether to be scared or happy to see his dangerously pretty ass. In the next moment, Jimin is slinging his arms around you before you can decide which part of your fight or flight response you want to utilize and <i><i>christ</i></i><i> </i>is his hug tight\u2013 <i>Bone</i> <i>crushing,</i> honestly. Still, he smells like pancakes and warm syrup, like all the good things you adore. Like home, really. As your arms wrap around the male in return, you almost feel like you\u2019re safe in his grasp.</p><p><i>\u2026Almost.</i><br>You know damn well never to <i>totally </i>let your guard down around that demon.</p><p>\u201cOh <i>god, </i>Y/n, it\u2019s been so long,\u201d He pulls away to look you over, \u201c\u2026How are you? Are you well? Ahh\u2013\u201d</p><p>His hands suddenly grip your cheeks and turns your head from side to side hard enough for your damn neck to pop.</p><p>\u201cOh goodness, your skin is\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pauses, milky eyes gazing into your own for a moment. You can feel yourself burning by the second because he\u2019s staring at you so fucking intently, until\u2013</p><p>\u201cY/n, your skin is <i>really</i> dried out. Do you even moisturize? Do you just rub fucking acid on your face? What the fuck?\u201d He squints, lips parting, <i>\u201c\u2026Why is it so dry\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>See?<br>This is why you have trust issues with Park Jimin\u2013 It\u2019s always some sneaky, underhanded bullshit with him.</p><p>He twists your head a couple more times, your neck pops, and it takes you physical effort to keep from swinging on him.</p><p>\u201cAight, aight. I get it my face is ugly, jesus christ,\u201d You grab his hands and jerk them off of your skin, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just say <i>hey</i> like a regular person, Park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Jimin starts, cocking a brow. He wiggles his hands until he holds your own, \u201cNever said you\u2019re ugly. You\u2019re the prettiest girl in the whole wide world, Petunia~\u201d</p><p>His tone turns flirtatiously melodic and your groan with a roll of your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI see the months apart haven\u2019t changed <i>that </i>part of you,\u201d You mumble.</p><p>\u201cWhat part?\u201d Counters Jimin with enthusiastic defiance, perking up, \u201cThe part of me that still feels nothin\u2019 but a\u2013 a <i>burning</i> desire to be with you? The part of me that <i>wants</i> you!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god\u2013 <i>Jimin,\u201d</i> You hiss with a scowl, \u201cDon\u2019t say that so loudly. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re really a bit embarrassed because he\u2019s borderline yelling and it doesn\u2019t help <i>at </i><i><i>all </i></i>that you can see an older African lady on her porch watching the two of you from a distance. She looks almost disgusted, kinda, but you get it. For some reason, you have the feeling if you saw a scene like the one you\u2019re currently in, you\u2019d be disgusted too.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jimin replies, leaning against your car as he eases closer to you, \u201cEmbarrassed, Petunia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like disgusted,\u201d You remark with a snarl to your lips and a gag to punctuate your words. You spin around, ignoring Jimin\u2019s immediate pout when you\u2019re no longer within flirting range. You walk to the other side of the car, pull open the door, grab your purse off the floor of the back seat, and gesture rather vaguely to the rest as Jimin approaches.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get my bags out the car and invite me in already,\u201d You ask\u2013 No, <i>demand,</i> \u201cA certain bitch is tired, her back hurts, and if she doesn\u2019t get <i>something</i> in her guts soon, her stomach is just gonna start eating away at itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could put something in your guts now,\u201d Jimin says with a smug smile and coy shrug, \u201cIf you want it. No cooking required\u2013 I could have you satisfied in seconds, Petunia.\u201d</p><p>You glance him over, brows raised. Your expression is almost impressed, honestly. Jimin is beginning to feel flushed with pride at his little remark when your brain shuts down and you fucking reply with a genuine\u2013</p><p>\u201cOh fuck, you carry a Snickers on you?\u201d</p><p>Jimin\u2019s face drops, \u201cW\u2026 Wait, what\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have it?\u201d You go on, \u201cI\u2019m fucking starving. I think if I don\u2019t eat soon my organs are gonna shut down or something.\u201d</p><p>Jimin pauses.</p><p>\u201cI, uh. That wasn\u2019t\u2026 what I meant,\u201d He shifts from foot to foot, your oblivious expression only making things worse.</p><p>\u201cY/n, I was talking about my di\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby!\u201d</p><p>You gasp, wind entirely knocked out of you when strong arms suddenly wrap around your form. He squeezes you tightly from behind, but it feels more like you\u2019re being attacked than affectionately hugged.</p><p>\u201cOh <i>FUCK, </i>Jungkook!\u201d You screech when you realize it\u2019s him, \u201cYou scared the shit outta me\u2013 Hey, get off! I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry\u2013\u201d Jungkook mumbles, but he hesitates a moment before finally pulling away.</p><p>You turn to look at him with a playful glare, punching his chest lightly.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re still the same clumsy motherfucker, huh?\u201d You tease, punching him again as your glare turns into a grin, \u201cWhat was that up there at the balcony? You were practically sucker punched by a fucking door, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s rude to say when you only <i>just </i>got here,\u201d Jungkook whines, shoving you back in your shoulder, \u201cI got hurt saying hi to <i>you </i>so <i>technically</i> it\u2019s <i>your</i> fault I\u2019m hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh uh!\u201d You exclaim, slamming your palms into his chest, \u201cYou\u2019re the clumsy jackass so it\u2019s <i>not</i> my fault.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d</i> He shoves you back, \u201cIt is, <i>too,</i> your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is <i>not!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIt is, <i>too!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIs not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs n\u2013\u201d</p><p>But before you can finish, Jimin clamps his hand over your mouth and exhaustedly says, \u201cYou both sound like two full-fledged fucking fools, I swear to god. Can we go inside already?\u201d</p><p>You and Jungkook glance back at him, a pout on your face.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d You huff, ripping Jimin\u2019s hand away from your face.</p><p>You step aside, letting Jimin and Jungkook get your two suitcases for you. It\u2019s when the three of you are walking toward the apartment with Jimin leading the way, you whisper hotly\u2013</p><p>\u201cIs <i>not, </i>Jeon Jungkook, <i>my</i> <i>fault.\u201d</i></p><p>Just for extra measure, you dig your fingers into Jungkook\u2019s waist and smile smugly when he squirms under your touch. The three of you walk closer still until Jimin pauses just before the stairs. You know him so well\u2013 <i>So </i>extremely well that when his plump lips part and a dazzling grin graces his handsome face, when he respectfully dips his head toward the African woman on her porch, you know almost instantaneously that he\u2019s forcing it. And Jungkook, too, is forcing his smile as he bows lightly toward the woman. Really, they both look\u2026 <i>Nervous. </i>You\u2019re intrigued.</p><p>Jimin starts first.</p><p>\u201cHello, bibi\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>And all it takes is for her to say those four words for Park Jimin to shut his fucking mouth. You watch as he leans back, chewing his inner cheek as he nods pointlessly, a defeated expression on his face. Even Jungkook looks like he\u2019s been silenced and he never even said anything. You\u2019re amazed, honestly. Clearly, this woman commands a lot of respect already\u2013 You can tell by the way her plump lips stay in a tight line, how her dark eyes are so focused and how her gaze is strict, as if she takes <b><i>zero</i></b> bullshit. Really, its like she can see right through Jungkook and Jimin. Or maybe they just <i>really </i>pissed her off. Could be both, though.</p><p>\u2026It\u2019s <i>probably</i> both.</p><p>\u201cThat your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d You reply, a bit surprised when she suddenly addresses you. She looks just as powerful when she glares at you and you suddenly feel as meek as Jungkook and Jimin.</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend,\u201d She asks again, but it\u2019s much less like a question and much more like a demand. She nods her head at Jimin and you jump, finally getting her question.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d You exclaim, scrambling for words as you wave your hands dismissively, \u201cNo, Jimin and I, we, uh, we\u2019re just\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s your boyfriend, you should know he cheating on you,\u201d She announces immediately.</p><p>You <i>would</i> guess you took too long to answer her and that\u2019s why she phrased it that way <i>if </i>it weren\u2019t for the fact that she just said what she said. You stutter in your words, broken syllables falling from your lips as you quickly turn to look at Jimin. He looks caught and the funny part about it is that the two of you aren\u2019t even dating.</p><p>Jimin, embarrassed, scrambles for an explanation as he glances between you, Jungkook, and finally to Bibi.</p><p>\u201cWait, no, <i>bibi,\u201d</i> he chuckles nervously, \u201cY/n and I aren\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been livin\u2019 here for fourteen years and in the last few months these children have been here, I\u2019ve seen every kind of girl you can imagine in and out that apartment. Its either you\u2019re runnin\u2019 \u2018round or you <i>must</i> be trying to raise an orphanage, cuz this is the sixth girl ive seen you with this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimin, oh my god\u2026\"You mumble, <i>barely </i>keeping in your laughter. You fake like you\u2019re shocked, cupping your hand over your mouth. Then, in a twisted sort of way, you say, \"I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re <i>cheating</i> on me\u2013\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cY/n\u2013\u201d</i> Jimin hisses, fucking exhausted. His eyes flare with a warning when he glares at you, but it\u2019s not like his three-foot tall self could beat your ass anyway, so the chances of you actually stopping are <i>very </i>low.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Jimin?\u201d You go on, faking total shock, \u201cIn the parking lot just now, you were just talking about the part of you that still feels a <i>burning</i> <i>desire</i> to be with me? What happened to the part of you that <i>wants</i> me!?\u201d</p><p>You swear you see Jimin\u2019s eye twitch and you <i>know </i>for an absolute, complete <i>fact </i>he is already thinking of ways to get you back. He\u2019s probably considering lighting your precious clothes on fire which, by the way, is something he <i>has </i>done to you before. To which you responded by nearly setting the hay atop his head that he <i>claims </i>to be hair on fire. And you would\u2019ve fucking done it, too, but then his last roommate, a tall, giraffe legged motherfucker, grabbed you and you ended up fighting the <i>roommate</i> instead. Long story short, Jimin wound up completely physically fine and the only person who got hurt was his previous roommate, Namjoon, who ended with a black eye and then moved out. It worked in your favor though, because Jimin was so strapped on cash for <i><i>months</i></i><i> </i>afterward trying to pay for that whole apartment by himself that you felt like you\u2019d still gotten your revenge.</p><p>\u201cLook, bibi, we aren\u2019t <i>really</i> dating,\u201d Jimin tries to speak calmly.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Bibi cocks a brow, \u201cYou lied when you told me your girlfriend was coming to town.\u201d</p><p>You snort audibly, but Bibi\u2019s quick glance has you shutting your big mouth. You mumble an apology, but really you\u2019re just <i>amazed </i>at how fucking <i>delusional</i> Jimin is as well as how\u2026 <i>blunt</i> Bibi is. Jimin lies and tells her you\u2019re his girlfriend stopping by for a visit, then Bibi, apparently aware of all the other girls Jimin\u2019s been fucking or whatever, tattles on him the <i>second </i>you arrive. It\u2019s fucking comical, honestly, but you must admit, you\u2019re starting to like this fierce old woman.</p><p>Jimin cringes, then drops his head and nods, \u201cYeah\u2026 I did.\u201d</p><p>Bibi just looks at him for a moment, her brows furrowed and lips parted in disgust, nearly. She then shakes her head and mumbles something, then waves Jimin off. She doesn\u2019t even need to say anything else, Jimin just murmurs a \u201cGoodbye, Bibi,\u201d and then rushes up the rest of the steps into the apartment. Bibi glances at Jungkook too, and Jungkook awkwardly follows in Jimin\u2019s steps and starts to leave. You\u2019re about to say bye and part ways as well when Bibi stops you. She holds up her hand to get your attention and you freeze.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You tilt your head at her, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She looks you over, as if deciding whether or not you\u2019re worth her breath, and then says\u2013</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sleep with that boy. The girl he was with yesterday had crabs.\u201d</p><p>And then she gets up and walks inside of her apartment, the door banging shut behind her.</p><p>You just stand there for a moment, your mouth agape until you hear Jungkook\u2019s voice call out to you.</p><p>\u201cY/n! Are you almost done talking to Bibi? I cooked and I really want us to sit down and eat together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d You turn and look up at Jungkook\u2019s expectant face. It takes you a split second to register Jungkook\u2019s words because Bibi\u2019s are still ringing in your ears, but you eventually do and nod.</p><p>\u201cY-Yeah,\u201d You mumble, shaking your head as if to snap back into your normal self before Jungkook gets suspicious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh. Comin\u2019 up now.\u201d</p><p>And then you grin.<br>And it\u2019s fake.<br>\u2026And Jungkook can tell your grin is fake as hell, but he doesn\u2019t say anything when you make your way up and enter the apartment.</p><p>The place is neat and tidy. <i>Homey. </i>White walls peppered with photo after photo of Jungkook and Jimin together, of each of them separately, of Taehyung, and of Jimin and Jungkook\u2019s family as well. The furniture is worn, but far from decayed. It is comfortably warm inside as well but the heat is mostly stemming from the kitchen. Jimin, who watches you taking everything in with an attentively curious gaze, tugs on your jacket until you follow along and shrug it off of your shoulders. He hangs it up for you and as he does, you slip off into the kitchen. You pause, leaning against the wall for a moment to deeply inhale the scent from within. It\u2019s savory and sweet all at once, enough to have your stomach whining and mouthwatering. The sound of a spoon tapping against a pot calls you back to earth and you open your eyes to see Jungkook stirring the food.</p><p>\u201cI.. cooked a lot,\u201d He announces softly. <i>Embarrassed</i> is what he sounds like, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how much you would eat or what you even preferred, so I kind of got carried away.\u201d</p><p>He grins sheepishly, then turns to glance up at you, \u201cYou <i>will</i> eat\u2026 right?\u201d</p><p>You gaze at him for a moment, then grin, a wave of adoration hitting you that makes you want to pinch his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. I could eat all this\u2013\u201d You make a wide, general gesture out toward the kitchen, \u201c\u2013And then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Jungkook exclaims.</p><p>By the soft flush to his cheeks and the way he gracefully checks the oven, he\u2019s clearly satisfied with your answer. But because you just <i>have </i>to fuck with people, you clear your throat and say\u2013</p><p>\u201cOr not.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook freezes.</p><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know~,\u201d You stretch flippantly, movements flamboyant and overdramatic, \u201cI might not <i>actually</i> be able to eat all of this after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Wait, no, why not?\u201d Jungkook presses, letting go of the spoon and leaving it in the pot. He looks distressed and you <i>know </i>you\u2019re being mean but you also\u2026 Don\u2019t care enough to stop. Besides, after all the times Jungkook teased <i>you </i>over shit, revenge is only necessary, right?</p><p>\u201cAre you not hungry? Or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m plenty hungry,\u201d You turn around, cross your hands behind your back and deliberately edge away from him, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jungkook steps closer, tilting his head.</p><p><i>\u201cJust?\u201d</i> He urges.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the last time I checked, your cooking was\u2013\u201d</p><p>But your teasing quip is cut short when you suddenly hear a slightly feminine voice call out a groggy\u2013</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with all the noise? This is the second time you \u2019ve woken me up on one of my off days,\u201d She calls, her words tired and slurred with an accent you know well\u2013 Better than well, actually, its a sound burned into your very <i>soul</i> at this point.</p><p>You hear Jimin start to respond to her, but you\u2019re already in motion. You rush out of the kitchen, almost tripping as you round the corner until suddenly you see her physically before you. And there, just down the hall, is where she stands\u2013 In clear view is no one else besides Min Yoonji. Her jet black locks are silken and messy all the same, strands sticking out here and there. Those familiar dark eyes of hers are tired\u2013 <i><i>Hazy</i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i><i> </i>Her tone is sun-kissed yet so <i>pale</i> all at once, its as if she\u2019s fallen ill\u2026 Not like the Yoonji you once knew years back who\u2019s skin was as vibrant as\u2013 No, <i>rivaled with</i> a freshly bloomed flower. The woman is dressed in a long black tee that stops just above her knees, black socks on her feet, black bags under her eyes to match her atmosphere. It\u2019s a concoction of feelings that <i>rush </i>you when you see her, two of them very prominent all the same. One emotion is <i>pure,</i> <i>honest,</i> <i>childish</i> joy that stems from the very pit of your being the <i>moment </i>you lay eyes on her figure.</p><p>The second?</p><p>\u2026Fear.</p><p>The last time you checked, Min Yoonji\u2013 <i>your </i>Min Yoonji did <i>not </i>look the way <i>this </i>Min Yoonji looks now. Staring at her sleek frame, her exhausted movements, you know she\u2019s changed and it\u2019s nowhere near for the better.</p><p>But you swallow it down, push that fear from your mind the moment you notice it and instead fall into excitement.</p><p>Yoonji looks\u2026 Shocked when she sees you. Her jaw falls slack, eyes blinking again and again as she gazes at you with hard, confused eyes. She even points at you, lips struggling to find words for a moment until all she says is\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p>Jimin just giggles, grinning, \u201cY/n\u2019s stopping by for a visit,\u201d He explains simply.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here for the next few days,\u201d Jungkook continues seamlessly as he too appears from the kitchen, a towel in his grasp that he dries his hands on, \u201cWe agreed not to tell you because Y/n wanted to surprise you.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSurpriseee~\u201d</i> You call, waving your hands like it\u2019s some big reveal, the cheekiest of grins on your face.</p><p>Yoonji\u2019s lips part and shut until finally, she finds a way to express her utter bewilderment and excitement. She rushes forward and you meet her halfway as she practically throws herself into your arms. You gasp when her chest slams into your own, stumbling back again as her arms wrap around your neck. Her grip is tight, her face nuzzled into your neck as quick, slurred comments on how much she\u2019s fucking missed you fall from her lips. You giggle, squeezing her terribly skinny frame back, but in all honesty, she\u2019s grown so <i>thin </i>you almost worry that you\u2019ll snap her in half if you squeeze her even the slightest bit too hard.</p><p><i><b>\u201c</b></i><i><i><b>God,</b></i></i><i><i> I </i></i><i><i><i>missed </i></i></i><i><i><i><i>you\u2026\u201d </i></i></i></i>Yoonji hisses the words in your ear, her nails digging into your flesh.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, tooooo!\u201d You whine back, rocking the two of you from side to side.</p><p>In all honesty, the hug is far too short, but you and Min Yoonji are well aware of Jimin and Jungkook who stand closely behind. So you part ways just as quickly as you begin and suppress your feelings for now.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s so nice to be with you all again,\u201d You remark, glancing at Jungkook\u2019s glimmering smile, Jimin\u2019s flushed cheeks, and then a quick glance at Yoonji\u2019s lips before you turn back to the boys, \u201cIf I could be here all the time, I would\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should, then!\u201d Jimin exclaims, suddenly grabbing you by your hands and pulling toward the kitchen table, \u201cStay with us! We\u2019d make some room for you!\u201d</p><p>Yoonji smirks, following along, \u201cYeah, we\u2019d kick Jungkook\u2019s ass out and you can take his room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeeey!\u201d<i> </i>Jungkook retorts, glaring at your Yoonji, \u201cWhy do <i>I </i>get kicked out? Why not Jimin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can stand Jimin a <i>little </i>bit more than I can stand <i>you\u2013\u201d</i></p><p>And then she jabs her pointed finger into Jungkook\u2019s chest for extra measure. The male whines, clutching his injured chest and you giggle at the sight. Still bickering and fussing as always\u2013 They really never changed. But the lack of change in your dynamic is warming, all the same. Even after leaving for months, you can still come home to the people you love and feel nothing but comfort.</p><p>The four of you take your seats at the roundtable, Yoonji on your left, Jungook on your right, and Jimin across. When Jungkook slips into the kitchen to make the plates of food, he calls Jimin in for his help. It\u2019s after the shorter male shoots you one of his dazzling smiles, sticks his tongue out at Yoonji, then dips off into the kitchen, you feel her hand come to squeeze your thigh. You catch her gaze for a moment, eyes hooded as you take in her form. Yoonji\u2019s face rests in her left hand as she gazes at you with soft eyes, blinking with the slow, carefulness of a feline. A million emotions stir within her shimmering gaze and you wonder how it is <i>possible </i>for one person to carry stars in their eyes. You gaze down at her hand, at the bony joints and slender fingers that clutch the plump flesh of your thigh. Her hands have always been big, and you\u2019ve always loved the way they look wrapped around your own, how they feel when they clutch your cheeks\u2026</p><p>You laugh then when you feel the urge to kiss her hit you strong and you\u2019re suddenly too embarrassed to even look at her anymore. Your skin, soft and supple, <i>burns </i>where her palm lingers\u2013 <i>Taunting </i>you with the sensation. Far too long has it been since the two of you seen each other last, and now that the two of you are finally together, holding back for the sake of Jimin and Jungkook is borderline hellish. The two of you are lesbians, after all, <i>closeted </i>lesbians, and neither one of you are ready to come out. Even with the two boys, there is always that fear that you\u2019ll be looked at <i>differently </i>for admitting to being lovers\u2013 It already didn\u2019t go well with either one of your parents. Yoonji\u2019s momma practically disowned her when Yoonji came out to her some years ago, and your mother <i>claims</i> she doesn\u2019t think of you any differently now, but you <i>know </i>she does. So after coming out to people who claimed to love you unconditionally only to run head-first into a condition, why risk it again?</p><p>These thoughts swim in your mind, a mixture of sadness and bitterness accompanying them. Your mood shifts and Yoonji knows it does\u2013 It\u2019s like she can read the very hazy, fearful words on your mind despite you having said nothing. Her grip on your thigh tightens until you turn to look at her, and its like she can hear every little thought running through your head. She blinks and there\u2019s a little bit more <i>focus </i>and <i>anxiety </i>in her gaze, mixing in with her adoration towards you.</p><p><i>\u201c</i><i><i>It\u2019s</i></i><i><i><i> </i></i></i><i><i><i><i>okay</i></i></i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i><i>\u201d</i></p><p>It the words that her little lips silently whisper when they part and suddenly you feel like everything <i>is </i>okay again. That\u2019s the power of Min Yoonji\u2013 Better yet, it just may be the power that coexists between two lovers, but you know Yoonji would tease you for saying something as cheesy as that. So, with the suddenness of rain on a sunny day, you\u2019re fine again.<br>For now, at least.</p><p>Jungkook and Jimin return and Yoonji\u2019s hand falls from your thigh with slickness and ease that has you wishing it was back again. But you\u2019re thankful for it all the same because Jungkook and Jimin are utterly clueless to it. Dishes clatter and empty stomachs sing as the tantalizing scent of food harass each of you. You sing your compliments to Jungkook, to which he beams brighter than the sun in response to. Then eagerly, you devour the meal before you, joyful conversation filling the air as a sense of peace befalls you.</p><p>It\u2019s a happy, pleasant atmosphere that lingers during the meal, after it is over, when you all watch a movie together, and then finally when the sun gives her final goodbyes and leaves with her lover, Moon, taking her place with grace and class. Jungkook and Jimin apologize and excuse themselves to their room since they both have early shifts the next day, hug and pepper your cheeks in playfully sloppy kisses (an action to which you notice Yoonji dislikes, you see it in the way her eyes slide to the side, how her gaze dims, how her hands tighten) and then suddenly, its only you and Yoonji.</p><p>You\u2019ll be sleeping in her room for the next bit you\u2019re here and honestly, the arrangement is perfect for the two of you. Into her room you and she go, the door clicking softly shut behind you. You pause, turning back to lock the door and as you do, you can feel Yoonji hovering near. She\u2019s always been <i>hot</i>\u2013 Temperature-wise, that is. So when her warm hands clutch your cool arms, when soft, heated lips press themselves to the back of your icy neck, and when a soft groan falls from her lips and makes the hair on your entire being stand up, you freeze. You soak it in, soak in the way it feels so familiar to have her pressing against you like this. Her hands drop to your hips as she practically pins you against the door, a sigh dripping from you like sap from a tree. You feel like you are burning as you manage to turn around, meeting your lovers gaze with unsteady eyes. She\u2019s closer now, closer for you to look at and you see it clear as day.</p><p><i>She is not well.</i></p><p>Yoonji, oblivious, leans forward on the tips of her toes and attempts to kiss you, but you stop her when your hands suddenly clutch her cheeks. She freezes, her head laying heavy in your grip. You almost can\u2019t believe it, the dramatic change that your girl has gone through, but you know trauma changes a person. So you pull her close and run your fingers through her hair, plant a kiss to her cheek, then softly whisper\u2013</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Yoonji hesitates but pulls back to stare you in your eyes. She inches out of your grip and you notice her fear.</p><p>\u201cAre\u2026 Are we breaking up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d You say, an airy, lifeless, laugh with your words, \u201cBut this <i>is</i> about you, baby\u2026\u201d</p><p>You slide past, taking a seat on the edge of her bed and patting the space next to you. Yoonji follows obediently, sitting so close her thigh touches yours. You grab her hands and hold them in your own, staring at the veins pumping blood beneath the flesh. You\u2019ve always loved those hands of hers, they\u2019re probably your favorite trait on her besides her, well\u2026 Her everything. You plant kisses to the tips of each finger until you\u2019ve done all ten, until you realize Yoonji\u2019s eyes are glazed over like she\u2019s a million miles away or like she may even pass out right then and there. You snap your own fingers and she clicks back into awareness so suddenly that it frightens you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yoonji asks as if nothing happened, imploring you to reply and finally talk, \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d</p><p>She means it as a joke but you can\u2019t even fake a laugh.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Yoonji,\u201d You start softly, \u201cHow are you\u2026\u201d</p><p>You pause, take in a deep breath to halt the stinging of tears in your eyes, then force out the words.</p><p><i>\u201cHow have you been since Yoongi and Hoseok died?\u201d</i></p><p>It\u2019s a question Yoonji doesn\u2019t know how to answer.<br></p></p>",

You\u2019re just so fucking <i>busy\u2013 </i>Constantly smothered with assignment after assignment, and with your terrible time management skills, you\u2019re always rushing to get things done just in the nick of time. It\u2019s because of this that you\u2019re constantly playing a catch-up game that saps up any free time you might <i>possibly</i> have. You\u2019re usually crammed in your apartment because of this and a lot of the time your head is a mess of formulas you don\u2019t care for and poets you can\u2019t care to remember. But <i>this </i>week is <i>different.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Lately, you\u2019ve taken on a new regimen when you work on your assignments and it keeps you focused enough to get your work together without the distractions. You\u2019ve been doing so well as of late that you\u2019ve<i> </i><i><i>finally </i></i>had some time where instead of hunching over a desk full of papers, you\u2019re just chilling out without a single educational thing on your mind. It\u2019s peaceful, really. So when your close friend Jungkook hits you up one day, practically <i>begging </i>you to spend some time at his place, you\u2019re happy to say that you can agree without much of a regret in doing so.</p><p>The drive down is long, but you\u2019re anxious to see Jungkook as well as his roommates, which happen to be more friends of yours. You live far from them all and you longed to see them for ages now, so to say you are excited it an understatement. As you drive, you can practically hear Jungkook\u2019s teasing quips and remarks now\u2013 He always had a stupidly sharp tongue and a mouth that moved faster than his god damn brain, so the bullshit that flies from his mouth is\u2026 <i>Interesting,</i> to say the least.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Jimin, the demonic entity you\u2019ve had the absolute pleasure and displeasure of knowing. He\u2019s crazy intelligent, but underhanded all the same\u2013 You can still remember that one time he nearly dragged you into a robbery. He had it all planned out, all wrapped up in a pretty red bow and with those cute, plump lips of his and that easy going smile, you could\u2019ve fallen for it. His plan, he admitted later when it all fell through, was for you to be the getaway driver for another person who would do the actual robbery and it <i>could\u2019ve</i> worked if you didn\u2019t know him so well\u2026</p><p>Of course, you kinda knew what was up since you\u2019ve done something similar among many, <i><i>many</i></i><i> </i>other things. You try not to think about that part in your life much. Between the near fucking deaths and necromancy, you really were an entirely different person compared to who you are now. It\u2019s growth, really.</p><p>You\u2019re sure you\u2019ll see Taehyung, too, yet another creative character. He\u2019s an art major as well a self-proclaimed artistic genius and intellectual even though he borderline fails every single fuckin class besides those pertaining to art. He really is a wonder when it comes down to it, though, and in more ways than one. One time he was failing literature and managed to dig up enough dirt on his <i>married</i> literature teacher\u2019s affair with yet <i>another</i> teacher that she had literally no other option than to boost Taehyung\u2019s grade up to an A. It lasted for the entire year, too, and then when Taehyung changed courses he snitched anyway. When you asked him about it he just said something along the lines of \u201cshe earned it\u201d and nothing else at all on the matter ever again, so yeah. That\u2019s Kim Taehyung.</p><p>When you finally pull into the parking lot of their apartment complex and park, you\u2019re exhausted. Ravenous, too\u2013 Your dumb ass forgot to eat before you left, of all things, and you know once Jungkook finds out about that as well as you\u2019re rather<i> </i><i><i>unstable</i></i> eating habits, he\u2019ll probably have a knife to your neck and spoon feed you himself. You wouldn\u2019t mind it much, though, because that\u2019s the way Jungkook is and how he expresses affection. Also\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t mind him waiting on you hand and foot to cater to you. In fact, you might just fuck around and collapse as soon as you step into the apartment just so he can do exactly that\u2026 Fuck yeah.</p><p>You hop out of the car, rolling your neck and shoulders. Your muscles pop as you dig out your phone, pulling up Jungkook\u2019s number to shoot him a text.</p><p>\u201chey\u201d<br>\u201cim outside\u201d</p><p>You begin typing your third text message, but by the time you get to the word <i>my </i>of \u201chelp me get <i>my</i> bags out the car\u201d you can hear the sound of a door flying open somewhere and a loud, cheery voice absolutely <i>screaming</i>\u2013</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S MY <i>FUCKING</i> GIRL!\u201d</p><p>With his arms outstretched wide and a cheeky, blinding grin, you look up to see Jungkook standing at the doorway of a nearby unit. You grin, chuckling lightly as you throw up your hand in a wave. He\u2019s so happy, <i>so</i><i><i>,</i></i><i> </i><i><i>so </i></i>happy that he doesn\u2019t even realize the glass screen door is swinging back until it hits him.</p><p><i>Literally</i>\u2026</p><p>Hits him.</p><p>It swings back into his face hard enough for him to flinch as the sound of glass hitting skin rings clear and he loses his balance, fucking collapsing right then and there. You flinch yourself at the impact and cringe.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Ah,\u201d</p><p>You mumble it aloud softly as you slowly drop your arm. Looks like Jungkook still has that clumsy, awkward phase going on. It\u2019s cute, yeah. In a sad sort of way.</p><p>You see Jimin appear behind the door, see him staring down at his roommate with an almost tired look. Jungkook raises his arm up as if asking for Jimin\u2019s help and to your very little surprise, Jimin just fucking steps over Jungkook\u2019s body and out the door.</p><p>\u201cY/n!\u201d Jimin calls, hopping down the steps with graceful, vigorous movements, glancing up between you and the stairs beneath his feet as if the interaction with Jungkook never happened.</p><p>Soon he touches the ground and dashes up to you with rushed movements, but the sight of the male has you borderline swooning. Jimin is utterly, wholly, entirely <i><i>adorable</i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i> The way the sun is shining down, beams of light kissing his honey cheeks and staining his skin in its healing light, his dark eyes like crescents, arms out wide, he looks like a devious little angel\u2013 You don\u2019t know whether to be scared or happy to see his dangerously pretty ass. In the next moment, Jimin is slinging his arms around you before you can decide which part of your fight or flight response you want to utilize and <i><i>christ</i></i><i> </i>is his hug tight\u2013 <i>Bone</i> <i>crushing,</i> honestly. Still, he smells like pancakes and warm syrup, like all the good things you adore. Like home, really. As your arms wrap around the male in return, you almost feel like you\u2019re safe in his grasp.</p><p><i>\u2026Almost.</i><br>You know damn well never to <i>totally </i>let your guard down around that demon.</p><p>\u201cOh <i>god, </i>Y/n, it\u2019s been so long,\u201d He pulls away to look you over, \u201c\u2026How are you? Are you well? Ahh\u2013\u201d</p><p>His hands suddenly grip your cheeks and turns your head from side to side hard enough for your damn neck to pop.</p><p>\u201cOh goodness, your skin is\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pauses, milky eyes gazing into your own for a moment. You can feel yourself burning by the second because he\u2019s staring at you so fucking intently, until\u2013</p><p>\u201cY/n, your skin is <i>really</i> dried out. Do you even moisturize? Do you just rub fucking acid on your face? What the fuck?\u201d He squints, lips parting, <i>\u201c\u2026Why is it so dry\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>See?<br>This is why you have trust issues with Park Jimin\u2013 It\u2019s always some sneaky, underhanded bullshit with him.</p><p>He twists your head a couple more times, your neck pops, and it takes you physical effort to keep from swinging on him.</p><p>\u201cAight, aight. I get it my face is ugly, jesus christ,\u201d You grab his hands and jerk them off of your skin, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just say <i>hey</i> like a regular person, Park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Jimin starts, cocking a brow. He wiggles his hands until he holds your own, \u201cNever said you\u2019re ugly. You\u2019re the prettiest girl in the whole wide world, Petunia~\u201d</p><p>His tone turns flirtatiously melodic and your groan with a roll of your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI see the months apart haven\u2019t changed <i>that </i>part of you,\u201d You mumble.</p><p>\u201cWhat part?\u201d Counters Jimin with enthusiastic defiance, perking up, \u201cThe part of me that still feels nothin\u2019 but a\u2013 a <i>burning</i> desire to be with you? The part of me that <i>wants</i> you!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god\u2013 <i>Jimin,\u201d</i> You hiss with a scowl, \u201cDon\u2019t say that so loudly. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re really a bit embarrassed because he\u2019s borderline yelling and it doesn\u2019t help <i>at </i><i><i>all </i></i>that you can see an older African lady on her porch watching the two of you from a distance. She looks almost disgusted, kinda, but you get it. For some reason, you have the feeling if you saw a scene like the one you\u2019re currently in, you\u2019d be disgusted too.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jimin replies, leaning against your car as he eases closer to you, \u201cEmbarrassed, Petunia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like disgusted,\u201d You remark with a snarl to your lips and a gag to punctuate your words. You spin around, ignoring Jimin\u2019s immediate pout when you\u2019re no longer within flirting range. You walk to the other side of the car, pull open the door, grab your purse off the floor of the back seat, and gesture rather vaguely to the rest as Jimin approaches.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get my bags out the car and invite me in already,\u201d You ask\u2013 No, <i>demand,</i> \u201cA certain bitch is tired, her back hurts, and if she doesn\u2019t get <i>something</i> in her guts soon, her stomach is just gonna start eating away at itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could put something in your guts now,\u201d Jimin says with a smug smile and coy shrug, \u201cIf you want it. No cooking required\u2013 I could have you satisfied in seconds, Petunia.\u201d</p><p>You glance him over, brows raised. Your expression is almost impressed, honestly. Jimin is beginning to feel flushed with pride at his little remark when your brain shuts down and you fucking reply with a genuine\u2013</p><p>\u201cOh fuck, you carry a Snickers on you?\u201d</p><p>Jimin\u2019s face drops, \u201cW\u2026 Wait, what\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have it?\u201d You go on, \u201cI\u2019m fucking starving. I think if I don\u2019t eat soon my organs are gonna shut down or something.\u201d</p><p>Jimin pauses.</p><p>\u201cI, uh. That wasn\u2019t\u2026 what I meant,\u201d He shifts from foot to foot, your oblivious expression only making things worse.</p><p>\u201cY/n, I was talking about my di\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby!\u201d</p><p>You gasp, wind entirely knocked out of you when strong arms suddenly wrap around your form. He squeezes you tightly from behind, but it feels more like you\u2019re being attacked than affectionately hugged.</p><p>\u201cOh <i>FUCK, </i>Jungkook!\u201d You screech when you realize it\u2019s him, \u201cYou scared the shit outta me\u2013 Hey, get off! I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry\u2013\u201d Jungkook mumbles, but he hesitates a moment before finally pulling away.</p><p>You turn to look at him with a playful glare, punching his chest lightly.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re still the same clumsy motherfucker, huh?\u201d You tease, punching him again as your glare turns into a grin, \u201cWhat was that up there at the balcony? You were practically sucker punched by a fucking door, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s rude to say when you only <i>just </i>got here,\u201d Jungkook whines, shoving you back in your shoulder, \u201cI got hurt saying hi to <i>you </i>so <i>technically</i> it\u2019s <i>your</i> fault I\u2019m hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh uh!\u201d You exclaim, slamming your palms into his chest, \u201cYou\u2019re the clumsy jackass so it\u2019s <i>not</i> my fault.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d</i> He shoves you back, \u201cIt is, <i>too,</i> your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is <i>not!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIt is, <i>too!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIs not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs n\u2013\u201d</p><p>But before you can finish, Jimin clamps his hand over your mouth and exhaustedly says, \u201cYou both sound like two full-fledged fucking fools, I swear to god. Can we go inside already?\u201d</p><p>You and Jungkook glance back at him, a pout on your face.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d You huff, ripping Jimin\u2019s hand away from your face.</p><p>You step aside, letting Jimin and Jungkook get your two suitcases for you. It\u2019s when the three of you are walking toward the apartment with Jimin leading the way, you whisper hotly\u2013</p><p>\u201cIs <i>not, </i>Jeon Jungkook, <i>my</i> <i>fault.\u201d</i></p><p>Just for extra measure, you dig your fingers into Jungkook\u2019s waist and smile smugly when he squirms under your touch. The three of you walk closer still until Jimin pauses just before the stairs. You know him so well\u2013 <i>So </i>extremely well that when his plump lips part and a dazzling grin graces his handsome face, when he respectfully dips his head toward the African woman on her porch, you know almost instantaneously that he\u2019s forcing it. And Jungkook, too, is forcing his smile as he bows lightly toward the woman. Really, they both look\u2026 <i>Nervous. </i>You\u2019re intrigued.</p><p>Jimin starts first.</p><p>\u201cHello, bibi\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>And all it takes is for her to say those four words for Park Jimin to shut his fucking mouth. You watch as he leans back, chewing his inner cheek as he nods pointlessly, a defeated expression on his face. Even Jungkook looks like he\u2019s been silenced and he never even said anything. You\u2019re amazed, honestly. Clearly, this woman commands a lot of respect already\u2013 You can tell by the way her plump lips stay in a tight line, how her dark eyes are so focused and how her gaze is strict, as if she takes <b><i>zero</i></b> bullshit. Really, its like she can see right through Jungkook and Jimin. Or maybe they just <i>really </i>pissed her off. Could be both, though.</p><p>\u2026It\u2019s <i>probably</i> both.</p><p>\u201cThat your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d You reply, a bit surprised when she suddenly addresses you. She looks just as powerful when she glares at you and you suddenly feel as meek as Jungkook and Jimin.</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend,\u201d She asks again, but it\u2019s much less like a question and much more like a demand. She nods her head at Jimin and you jump, finally getting her question.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d You exclaim, scrambling for words as you wave your hands dismissively, \u201cNo, Jimin and I, we, uh, we\u2019re just\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s your boyfriend, you should know he cheating on you,\u201d She announces immediately.</p><p>You <i>would</i> guess you took too long to answer her and that\u2019s why she phrased it that way <i>if </i>it weren\u2019t for the fact that she just said what she said. You stutter in your words, broken syllables falling from your lips as you quickly turn to look at Jimin. He looks caught and the funny part about it is that the two of you aren\u2019t even dating.</p><p>Jimin, embarrassed, scrambles for an explanation as he glances between you, Jungkook, and finally to Bibi.</p><p>\u201cWait, no, <i>bibi,\u201d</i> he chuckles nervously, \u201cY/n and I aren\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been livin\u2019 here for fourteen years and in the last few months these children have been here, I\u2019ve seen every kind of girl you can imagine in and out that apartment. Its either you\u2019re runnin\u2019 \u2018round or you <i>must</i> be trying to raise an orphanage, cuz this is the sixth girl ive seen you with this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimin, oh my god\u2026\"You mumble, <i>barely </i>keeping in your laughter. You fake like you\u2019re shocked, cupping your hand over your mouth. Then, in a twisted sort of way, you say, \"I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re <i>cheating</i> on me\u2013\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cY/n\u2013\u201d</i> Jimin hisses, fucking exhausted. His eyes flare with a warning when he glares at you, but it\u2019s not like his three-foot tall self could beat your ass anyway, so the chances of you actually stopping are <i>very </i>low.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Jimin?\u201d You go on, faking total shock, \u201cIn the parking lot just now, you were just talking about the part of you that still feels a <i>burning</i> <i>desire</i> to be with me? What happened to the part of you that <i>wants</i> me!?\u201d</p><p>You swear you see Jimin\u2019s eye twitch and you <i>know </i>for an absolute, complete <i>fact </i>he is already thinking of ways to get you back. He\u2019s probably considering lighting your precious clothes on fire which, by the way, is something he <i>has </i>done to you before. To which you responded by nearly setting the hay atop his head that he <i>claims </i>to be hair on fire. And you would\u2019ve fucking done it, too, but then his last roommate, a tall, giraffe legged motherfucker, grabbed you and you ended up fighting the <i>roommate</i> instead. Long story short, Jimin wound up completely physically fine and the only person who got hurt was his previous roommate, Namjoon, who ended with a black eye and then moved out. It worked in your favor though, because Jimin was so strapped on cash for <i><i>months</i></i><i> </i>afterward trying to pay for that whole apartment by himself that you felt like you\u2019d still gotten your revenge.</p><p>\u201cLook, bibi, we aren\u2019t <i>really</i> dating,\u201d Jimin tries to speak calmly.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Bibi cocks a brow, \u201cYou lied when you told me your girlfriend was coming to town.\u201d</p><p>You snort audibly, but Bibi\u2019s quick glance has you shutting your big mouth. You mumble an apology, but really you\u2019re just <i>amazed </i>at how fucking <i>delusional</i> Jimin is as well as how\u2026 <i>blunt</i> Bibi is. Jimin lies and tells her you\u2019re his girlfriend stopping by for a visit, then Bibi, apparently aware of all the other girls Jimin\u2019s been fucking or whatever, tattles on him the <i>second </i>you arrive. It\u2019s fucking comical, honestly, but you must admit, you\u2019re starting to like this fierce old woman.</p><p>Jimin cringes, then drops his head and nods, \u201cYeah\u2026 I did.\u201d</p><p>Bibi just looks at him for a moment, her brows furrowed and lips parted in disgust, nearly. She then shakes her head and mumbles something, then waves Jimin off. She doesn\u2019t even need to say anything else, Jimin just murmurs a \u201cGoodbye, Bibi,\u201d and then rushes up the rest of the steps into the apartment. Bibi glances at Jungkook too, and Jungkook awkwardly follows in Jimin\u2019s steps and starts to leave. You\u2019re about to say bye and part ways as well when Bibi stops you. She holds up her hand to get your attention and you freeze.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You tilt your head at her, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She looks you over, as if deciding whether or not you\u2019re worth her breath, and then says\u2013</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sleep with that boy. The girl he was with yesterday had crabs.\u201d</p><p>And then she gets up and walks inside of her apartment, the door banging shut behind her.</p><p>You just stand there for a moment, your mouth agape until you hear Jungkook\u2019s voice call out to you.</p><p>\u201cY/n! Are you almost done talking to Bibi? I cooked and I really want us to sit down and eat together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d You turn and look up at Jungkook\u2019s expectant face. It takes you a split second to register Jungkook\u2019s words because Bibi\u2019s are still ringing in your ears, but you eventually do and nod.</p><p>\u201cY-Yeah,\u201d You mumble, shaking your head as if to snap back into your normal self before Jungkook gets suspicious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh. Comin\u2019 up now.\u201d</p><p>And then you grin.<br>And it\u2019s fake.<br>\u2026And Jungkook can tell your grin is fake as hell, but he doesn\u2019t say anything when you make your way up and enter the apartment.</p><p>The place is neat and tidy. <i>Homey. </i>White walls peppered with photo after photo of Jungkook and Jimin together, of each of them separately, of Taehyung, and of Jimin and Jungkook\u2019s family as well. The furniture is worn, but far from decayed. It is comfortably warm inside as well but the heat is mostly stemming from the kitchen. Jimin, who watches you taking everything in with an attentively curious gaze, tugs on your jacket until you follow along and shrug it off of your shoulders. He hangs it up for you and as he does, you slip off into the kitchen. You pause, leaning against the wall for a moment to deeply inhale the scent from within. It\u2019s savory and sweet all at once, enough to have your stomach whining and mouthwatering. The sound of a spoon tapping against a pot calls you back to earth and you open your eyes to see Jungkook stirring the food.</p><p>\u201cI.. cooked a lot,\u201d He announces softly. <i>Embarrassed</i> is what he sounds like, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how much you would eat or what you even preferred, so I kind of got carried away.\u201d</p><p>He grins sheepishly, then turns to glance up at you, \u201cYou <i>will</i> eat\u2026 right?\u201d</p><p>You gaze at him for a moment, then grin, a wave of adoration hitting you that makes you want to pinch his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. I could eat all this\u2013\u201d You make a wide, general gesture out toward the kitchen, \u201c\u2013And then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Jungkook exclaims.</p><p>By the soft flush to his cheeks and the way he gracefully checks the oven, he\u2019s clearly satisfied with your answer. But because you just <i>have </i>to fuck with people, you clear your throat and say\u2013</p><p>\u201cOr not.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook freezes.</p><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know~,\u201d You stretch flippantly, movements flamboyant and overdramatic, \u201cI might not <i>actually</i> be able to eat all of this after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Wait, no, why not?\u201d Jungkook presses, letting go of the spoon and leaving it in the pot. He looks distressed and you <i>know </i>you\u2019re being mean but you also\u2026 Don\u2019t care enough to stop. Besides, after all the times Jungkook teased <i>you </i>over shit, revenge is only necessary, right?</p><p>\u201cAre you not hungry? Or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m plenty hungry,\u201d You turn around, cross your hands behind your back and deliberately edge away from him, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jungkook steps closer, tilting his head.</p><p><i>\u201cJust?\u201d</i> He urges.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the last time I checked, your cooking was\u2013\u201d</p><p>But your teasing quip is cut short when you suddenly hear a slightly feminine voice call out a groggy\u2013</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with all the noise? This is the second time you \u2019ve woken me up on one of my off days,\u201d She calls, her words tired and slurred with an accent you know well\u2013 Better than well, actually, its a sound burned into your very <i>soul</i> at this point.</p><p>You hear Jimin start to respond to her, but you\u2019re already in motion. You rush out of the kitchen, almost tripping as you round the corner until suddenly you see her physically before you. And there, just down the hall, is where she stands\u2013 In clear view is no one else besides Min Yoonji. Her jet black locks are silken and messy all the same, strands sticking out here and there. Those familiar dark eyes of hers are tired\u2013 <i><i>Hazy</i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i><i> </i>Her tone is sun-kissed yet so <i>pale</i> all at once, its as if she\u2019s fallen ill\u2026 Not like the Yoonji you once knew years back who\u2019s skin was as vibrant as\u2013 No, <i>rivaled with</i> a freshly bloomed flower. The woman is dressed in a long black tee that stops just above her knees, black socks on her feet, black bags under her eyes to match her atmosphere. It\u2019s a concoction of feelings that <i>rush </i>you when you see her, two of them very prominent all the same. One emotion is <i>pure,</i> <i>honest,</i> <i>childish</i> joy that stems from the very pit of your being the <i>moment </i>you lay eyes on her figure.</p><p>The second?</p><p>\u2026Fear.</p><p>The last time you checked, Min Yoonji\u2013 <i>your </i>Min Yoonji did <i>not </i>look the way <i>this </i>Min Yoonji looks now. Staring at her sleek frame, her exhausted movements, you know she\u2019s changed and it\u2019s nowhere near for the better.</p><p>But you swallow it down, push that fear from your mind the moment you notice it and instead fall into excitement.</p><p>Yoonji looks\u2026 Shocked when she sees you. Her jaw falls slack, eyes blinking again and again as she gazes at you with hard, confused eyes. She even points at you, lips struggling to find words for a moment until all she says is\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p>Jimin just giggles, grinning, \u201cY/n\u2019s stopping by for a visit,\u201d He explains simply.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here for the next few days,\u201d Jungkook continues seamlessly as he too appears from the kitchen, a towel in his grasp that he dries his hands on, \u201cWe agreed not to tell you because Y/n wanted to surprise you.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSurpriseee~\u201d</i> You call, waving your hands like it\u2019s some big reveal, the cheekiest of grins on your face.</p><p>Yoonji\u2019s lips part and shut until finally, she finds a way to express her utter bewilderment and excitement. She rushes forward and you meet her halfway as she practically throws herself into your arms. You gasp when her chest slams into your own, stumbling back again as her arms wrap around your neck. Her grip is tight, her face nuzzled into your neck as quick, slurred comments on how much she\u2019s fucking missed you fall from her lips. You giggle, squeezing her terribly skinny frame back, but in all honesty, she\u2019s grown so <i>thin </i>you almost worry that you\u2019ll snap her in half if you squeeze her even the slightest bit too hard.</p><p><i><b>\u201c</b></i><i><i><b>God,</b></i></i><i><i> I </i></i><i><i><i>missed </i></i></i><i><i><i><i>you\u2026\u201d </i></i></i></i>Yoonji hisses the words in your ear, her nails digging into your flesh.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, tooooo!\u201d You whine back, rocking the two of you from side to side.</p><p>In all honesty, the hug is far too short, but you and Min Yoonji are well aware of Jimin and Jungkook who stand closely behind. So you part ways just as quickly as you begin and suppress your feelings for now.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s so nice to be with you all again,\u201d You remark, glancing at Jungkook\u2019s glimmering smile, Jimin\u2019s flushed cheeks, and then a quick glance at Yoonji\u2019s lips before you turn back to the boys, \u201cIf I could be here all the time, I would\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should, then!\u201d Jimin exclaims, suddenly grabbing you by your hands and pulling toward the kitchen table, \u201cStay with us! We\u2019d make some room for you!\u201d</p><p>Yoonji smirks, following along, \u201cYeah, we\u2019d kick Jungkook\u2019s ass out and you can take his room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeeey!\u201d<i> </i>Jungkook retorts, glaring at your Yoonji, \u201cWhy do <i>I </i>get kicked out? Why not Jimin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can stand Jimin a <i>little </i>bit more than I can stand <i>you\u2013\u201d</i></p><p>And then she jabs her pointed finger into Jungkook\u2019s chest for extra measure. The male whines, clutching his injured chest and you giggle at the sight. Still bickering and fussing as always\u2013 They really never changed. But the lack of change in your dynamic is warming, all the same. Even after leaving for months, you can still come home to the people you love and feel nothing but comfort.</p><p>The four of you take your seats at the roundtable, Yoonji on your left, Jungook on your right, and Jimin across. When Jungkook slips into the kitchen to make the plates of food, he calls Jimin in for his help. It\u2019s after the shorter male shoots you one of his dazzling smiles, sticks his tongue out at Yoonji, then dips off into the kitchen, you feel her hand come to squeeze your thigh. You catch her gaze for a moment, eyes hooded as you take in her form. Yoonji\u2019s face rests in her left hand as she gazes at you with soft eyes, blinking with the slow, carefulness of a feline. A million emotions stir within her shimmering gaze and you wonder how it is <i>possible </i>for one person to carry stars in their eyes. You gaze down at her hand, at the bony joints and slender fingers that clutch the plump flesh of your thigh. Her hands have always been big, and you\u2019ve always loved the way they look wrapped around your own, how they feel when they clutch your cheeks\u2026</p><p>You laugh then when you feel the urge to kiss her hit you strong and you\u2019re suddenly too embarrassed to even look at her anymore. Your skin, soft and supple, <i>burns </i>where her palm lingers\u2013 <i>Taunting </i>you with the sensation. Far too long has it been since the two of you seen each other last, and now that the two of you are finally together, holding back for the sake of Jimin and Jungkook is borderline hellish. The two of you are lesbians, after all, <i>closeted </i>lesbians, and neither one of you are ready to come out. Even with the two boys, there is always that fear that you\u2019ll be looked at <i>differently </i>for admitting to being lovers\u2013 It already didn\u2019t go well with either one of your parents. Yoonji\u2019s momma practically disowned her when Yoonji came out to her some years ago, and your mother <i>claims</i> she doesn\u2019t think of you any differently now, but you <i>know </i>she does. So after coming out to people who claimed to love you unconditionally only to run head-first into a condition, why risk it again?</p><p>These thoughts swim in your mind, a mixture of sadness and bitterness accompanying them. Your mood shifts and Yoonji knows it does\u2013 It\u2019s like she can read the very hazy, fearful words on your mind despite you having said nothing. Her grip on your thigh tightens until you turn to look at her, and its like she can hear every little thought running through your head. She blinks and there\u2019s a little bit more <i>focus </i>and <i>anxiety </i>in her gaze, mixing in with her adoration towards you.</p><p><i>\u201c</i><i><i>It\u2019s</i></i><i><i><i> </i></i></i><i><i><i><i>okay</i></i></i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i><i>\u201d</i></p><p>It the words that her little lips silently whisper when they part and suddenly you feel like everything <i>is </i>okay again. That\u2019s the power of Min Yoonji\u2013 Better yet, it just may be the power that coexists between two lovers, but you know Yoonji would tease you for saying something as cheesy as that. So, with the suddenness of rain on a sunny day, you\u2019re fine again.<br>For now, at least.</p><p>Jungkook and Jimin return and Yoonji\u2019s hand falls from your thigh with slickness and ease that has you wishing it was back again. But you\u2019re thankful for it all the same because Jungkook and Jimin are utterly clueless to it. Dishes clatter and empty stomachs sing as the tantalizing scent of food harass each of you. You sing your compliments to Jungkook, to which he beams brighter than the sun in response to. Then eagerly, you devour the meal before you, joyful conversation filling the air as a sense of peace befalls you.</p><p>It\u2019s a happy, pleasant atmosphere that lingers during the meal, after it is over, when you all watch a movie together, and then finally when the sun gives her final goodbyes and leaves with her lover, Moon, taking her place with grace and class. Jungkook and Jimin apologize and excuse themselves to their room since they both have early shifts the next day, hug and pepper your cheeks in playfully sloppy kisses (an action to which you notice Yoonji dislikes, you see it in the way her eyes slide to the side, how her gaze dims, how her hands tighten) and then suddenly, its only you and Yoonji.</p><p>You\u2019ll be sleeping in her room for the next bit you\u2019re here and honestly, the arrangement is perfect for the two of you. Into her room you and she go, the door clicking softly shut behind you. You pause, turning back to lock the door and as you do, you can feel Yoonji hovering near. She\u2019s always been <i>hot</i>\u2013 Temperature-wise, that is. So when her warm hands clutch your cool arms, when soft, heated lips press themselves to the back of your icy neck, and when a soft groan falls from her lips and makes the hair on your entire being stand up, you freeze. You soak it in, soak in the way it feels so familiar to have her pressing against you like this. Her hands drop to your hips as she practically pins you against the door, a sigh dripping from you like sap from a tree. You feel like you are burning as you manage to turn around, meeting your lovers gaze with unsteady eyes. She\u2019s closer now, closer for you to look at and you see it clear as day.</p><p><i>She is not well.</i></p><p>Yoonji, oblivious, leans forward on the tips of her toes and attempts to kiss you, but you stop her when your hands suddenly clutch her cheeks. She freezes, her head laying heavy in your grip. You almost can\u2019t believe it, the dramatic change that your girl has gone through, but you know trauma changes a person. So you pull her close and run your fingers through her hair, plant a kiss to her cheek, then softly whisper\u2013</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Yoonji hesitates but pulls back to stare you in your eyes. She inches out of your grip and you notice her fear.</p><p>\u201cAre\u2026 Are we breaking up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d You say, an airy, lifeless, laugh with your words, \u201cBut this <i>is</i> about you, baby\u2026\u201d</p><p>You slide past, taking a seat on the edge of her bed and patting the space next to you. Yoonji follows obediently, sitting so close her thigh touches yours. You grab her hands and hold them in your own, staring at the veins pumping blood beneath the flesh. You\u2019ve always loved those hands of hers, they\u2019re probably your favorite trait on her besides her, well\u2026 Her everything. You plant kisses to the tips of each finger until you\u2019ve done all ten, until you realize Yoonji\u2019s eyes are glazed over like she\u2019s a million miles away or like she may even pass out right then and there. You snap your own fingers and she clicks back into awareness so suddenly that it frightens you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yoonji asks as if nothing happened, imploring you to reply and finally talk, \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d</p><p>She means it as a joke but you can\u2019t even fake a laugh.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Yoonji,\u201d You start softly, \u201cHow are you\u2026\u201d</p><p>You pause, take in a deep breath to halt the stinging of tears in your eyes, then force out the words.</p><p><i>\u201cHow have you been since Yoongi and Hoseok died?\u201d</i></p><p>It\u2019s a question Yoonji doesn\u2019t know how to answer.<br></p></p>",

You&rsquo;re just so fucking <i>busy&ndash; </i>Constantly smothered with assignment after assignment, and with your terrible time management skills, you&rsquo;re always rushing to get things done just in the nick of time. It&rsquo;s because of this that you&rsquo;re constantly playing a catch-up game that saps up any free time you might <i>possibly</i> have. You&rsquo;re usually crammed in your apartment because of this and a lot of the time your head is a mess of formulas you don&rsquo;t care for and poets you can&rsquo;t care to remember. But <i>this </i>week is <i>different.</i></p><p>Lately, you&rsquo;ve taken on a new regimen when you work on your assignments and it keeps you focused enough to get your work together without the distractions. You&rsquo;ve been doing so well as of late that you&rsquo;ve<i> </i><i><i>finally </i></i>had some time where instead of hunching over a desk full of papers, you&rsquo;re just chilling out without a single educational thing on your mind. It&rsquo;s peaceful, really. So when your close friend Jungkook hits you up one day, practically <i>begging </i>you to spend some time at his place, you&rsquo;re happy to say that you can agree without much of a regret in doing so.</p><p>The drive down is long, but you&rsquo;re anxious to see Jungkook as well as his roommates, which happen to be more friends of yours. You live far from them all and you longed to see them for ages now, so to say you are excited it an understatement. As you drive, you can practically hear Jungkook&rsquo;s teasing quips and remarks now&ndash; He always had a stupidly sharp tongue and a mouth that moved faster than his god damn brain, so the bullshit that flies from his mouth is&hellip; <i>Interesting,</i> to say the least.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s Jimin, the demonic entity you&rsquo;ve had the absolute pleasure and displeasure of knowing. He&rsquo;s crazy intelligent, but underhanded all the same&ndash; You can still remember that one time he nearly dragged you into a robbery. He had it all planned out, all wrapped up in a pretty red bow and with those cute, plump lips of his and that easy going smile, you could&rsquo;ve fallen for it. His plan, he admitted later when it all fell through, was for you to be the getaway driver for another person who would do the actual robbery and it <i>could&rsquo;ve</i> worked if you didn&rsquo;t know him so well&hellip;</p><p>Of course, you kinda knew what was up since you&rsquo;ve done something similar among many, <i><i>many</i></i><i> </i>other things. You try not to think about that part in your life much. Between the near fucking deaths and necromancy, you really were an entirely different person compared to who you are now. It&rsquo;s growth, really.</p><p>You&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll see Taehyung, too, yet another creative character. He&rsquo;s an art major as well a self-proclaimed artistic genius and intellectual even though he borderline fails every single fuckin class besides those pertaining to art. He really is a wonder when it comes down to it, though, and in more ways than one. One time he was failing literature and managed to dig up enough dirt on his <i>married</i> literature teacher&rsquo;s affair with yet <i>another</i> teacher that she had literally no other option than to boost Taehyung&rsquo;s grade up to an A. It lasted for the entire year, too, and then when Taehyung changed courses he snitched anyway. When you asked him about it he just said something along the lines of &ldquo;she earned it&rdquo; and nothing else at all on the matter ever again, so yeah. That&rsquo;s Kim Taehyung.</p><p>When you finally pull into the parking lot of their apartment complex and park, you&rsquo;re exhausted. Ravenous, too&ndash; Your dumb ass forgot to eat before you left, of all things, and you know once Jungkook finds out about that as well as you&rsquo;re rather<i> </i><i><i>unstable</i></i> eating habits, he&rsquo;ll probably have a knife to your neck and spoon feed you himself. You wouldn&rsquo;t mind it much, though, because that&rsquo;s the way Jungkook is and how he expresses affection. Also&hellip; you wouldn&rsquo;t mind him waiting on you hand and foot to cater to you. In fact, you might just fuck around and collapse as soon as you step into the apartment just so he can do exactly that&hellip; Fuck yeah.</p><p>You hop out of the car, rolling your neck and shoulders. Your muscles pop as you dig out your phone, pulling up Jungkook&rsquo;s number to shoot him a text.</p><p>&ldquo;hey&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;im outside&rdquo;</p><p>You begin typing your third text message, but by the time you get to the word <i>my </i>of &ldquo;help me get <i>my</i> bags out the car&rdquo; you can hear the sound of a door flying open somewhere and a loud, cheery voice absolutely <i>screaming</i>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S MY <i>FUCKING</i> GIRL!&rdquo;</p><p>With his arms outstretched wide and a cheeky, blinding grin, you look up to see Jungkook standing at the doorway of a nearby unit. You grin, chuckling lightly as you throw up your hand in a wave. He&rsquo;s so happy, <i>so</i><i><i>,</i></i><i> </i><i><i>so </i></i>happy that he doesn&rsquo;t even realize the glass screen door is swinging back until it hits him.</p><p><i>Literally</i>&hellip;</p><p>Hits him.</p><p>It swings back into his face hard enough for him to flinch as the sound of glass hitting skin rings clear and he loses his balance, fucking collapsing right then and there. You flinch yourself at the impact and cringe.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Ah,&rdquo;</p><p>You mumble it aloud softly as you slowly drop your arm. Looks like Jungkook still has that clumsy, awkward phase going on. It&rsquo;s cute, yeah. In a sad sort of way.</p><p>You see Jimin appear behind the door, see him staring down at his roommate with an almost tired look. Jungkook raises his arm up as if asking for Jimin&rsquo;s help and to your very little surprise, Jimin just fucking steps over Jungkook&rsquo;s body and out the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n!&rdquo; Jimin calls, hopping down the steps with graceful, vigorous movements, glancing up between you and the stairs beneath his feet as if the interaction with Jungkook never happened.</p><p>Soon he touches the ground and dashes up to you with rushed movements, but the sight of the male has you borderline swooning. Jimin is utterly, wholly, entirely <i><i>adorable</i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i> The way the sun is shining down, beams of light kissing his honey cheeks and staining his skin in its healing light, his dark eyes like crescents, arms out wide, he looks like a devious little angel&ndash; You don&rsquo;t know whether to be scared or happy to see his dangerously pretty ass. In the next moment, Jimin is slinging his arms around you before you can decide which part of your fight or flight response you want to utilize and <i><i>christ</i></i><i> </i>is his hug tight&ndash; <i>Bone</i> <i>crushing,</i> honestly. Still, he smells like pancakes and warm syrup, like all the good things you adore. Like home, really. As your arms wrap around the male in return, you almost feel like you&rsquo;re safe in his grasp.</p><p><i>&hellip;Almost.</i><br />You know damn well never to <i>totally </i>let your guard down around that demon.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh <i>god, </i>Y/n, it&rsquo;s been so long,&rdquo; He pulls away to look you over, &ldquo;&hellip;How are you? Are you well? Ahh&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>His hands suddenly grip your cheeks and turns your head from side to side hard enough for your damn neck to pop.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh goodness, your skin is&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He pauses, milky eyes gazing into your own for a moment. You can feel yourself burning by the second because he&rsquo;s staring at you so fucking intently, until&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, your skin is <i>really</i> dried out. Do you even moisturize? Do you just rub fucking acid on your face? What the fuck?&rdquo; He squints, lips parting, <i>&ldquo;&hellip;Why is it so dry&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>See?<br />This is why you have trust issues with Park Jimin&ndash; It&rsquo;s always some sneaky, underhanded bullshit with him.</p><p>He twists your head a couple more times, your neck pops, and it takes you physical effort to keep from swinging on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Aight, aight. I get it my face is ugly, jesus christ,&rdquo; You grab his hands and jerk them off of your skin, &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t just say <i>hey</i> like a regular person, Park?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; Jimin starts, cocking a brow. He wiggles his hands until he holds your own, &ldquo;Never said you&rsquo;re ugly. You&rsquo;re the prettiest girl in the whole wide world, Petunia~&rdquo;</p><p>His tone turns flirtatiously melodic and your groan with a roll of your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I see the months apart haven&rsquo;t changed <i>that </i>part of you,&rdquo; You mumble.</p><p>&ldquo;What part?&rdquo; Counters Jimin with enthusiastic defiance, perking up, &ldquo;The part of me that still feels nothin&rsquo; but a&ndash; a <i>burning</i> desire to be with you? The part of me that <i>wants</i> you!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god&ndash; <i>Jimin,&rdquo;</i> You hiss with a scowl, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that so loudly. It&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re really a bit embarrassed because he&rsquo;s borderline yelling and it doesn&rsquo;t help <i>at </i><i><i>all </i></i>that you can see an older African lady on her porch watching the two of you from a distance. She looks almost disgusted, kinda, but you get it. For some reason, you have the feeling if you saw a scene like the one you&rsquo;re currently in, you&rsquo;d be disgusted too.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Jimin replies, leaning against your car as he eases closer to you, &ldquo;Embarrassed, Petunia?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More like disgusted,&rdquo; You remark with a snarl to your lips and a gag to punctuate your words. You spin around, ignoring Jimin&rsquo;s immediate pout when you&rsquo;re no longer within flirting range. You walk to the other side of the car, pull open the door, grab your purse off the floor of the back seat, and gesture rather vaguely to the rest as Jimin approaches.</p><p>&ldquo;Help me get my bags out the car and invite me in already,&rdquo; You ask&ndash; No, <i>demand,</i> &ldquo;A certain bitch is tired, her back hurts, and if she doesn&rsquo;t get <i>something</i> in her guts soon, her stomach is just gonna start eating away at itself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could put something in your guts now,&rdquo; Jimin says with a smug smile and coy shrug, &ldquo;If you want it. No cooking required&ndash; I could have you satisfied in seconds, Petunia.&rdquo;</p><p>You glance him over, brows raised. Your expression is almost impressed, honestly. Jimin is beginning to feel flushed with pride at his little remark when your brain shuts down and you fucking reply with a genuine&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck, you carry a Snickers on you?&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s face drops, &ldquo;W&hellip; Wait, what&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I have it?&rdquo; You go on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fucking starving. I think if I don&rsquo;t eat soon my organs are gonna shut down or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin pauses.</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh. That wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; what I meant,&rdquo; He shifts from foot to foot, your oblivious expression only making things worse.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I was talking about my di&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby!&rdquo;</p><p>You gasp, wind entirely knocked out of you when strong arms suddenly wrap around your form. He squeezes you tightly from behind, but it feels more like you&rsquo;re being attacked than affectionately hugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh <i>FUCK, </i>Jungkook!&rdquo; You screech when you realize it&rsquo;s him, &ldquo;You scared the shit outta me&ndash; Hey, get off! I can&rsquo;t breathe!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry&ndash;&rdquo; Jungkook mumbles, but he hesitates a moment before finally pulling away.</p><p>You turn to look at him with a playful glare, punching his chest lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re still the same clumsy motherfucker, huh?&rdquo; You tease, punching him again as your glare turns into a grin, &ldquo;What was that up there at the balcony? You were practically sucker punched by a fucking door, you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s rude to say when you only <i>just </i>got here,&rdquo; Jungkook whines, shoving you back in your shoulder, &ldquo;I got hurt saying hi to <i>you </i>so <i>technically</i> it&rsquo;s <i>your</i> fault I&rsquo;m hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nuh uh!&rdquo; You exclaim, slamming your palms into his chest, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the clumsy jackass so it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> my fault.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;</i> He shoves you back, &ldquo;It is, <i>too,</i> your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is <i>not!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;It is, <i>too!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Is not!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is, too!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is n&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>But before you can finish, Jimin clamps his hand over your mouth and exhaustedly says, &ldquo;You both sound like two full-fledged fucking fools, I swear to god. Can we go inside already?&rdquo;</p><p>You and Jungkook glance back at him, a pout on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; You huff, ripping Jimin&rsquo;s hand away from your face.</p><p>You step aside, letting Jimin and Jungkook get your two suitcases for you. It&rsquo;s when the three of you are walking toward the apartment with Jimin leading the way, you whisper hotly&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is <i>not, </i>Jeon Jungkook, <i>my</i> <i>fault.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Just for extra measure, you dig your fingers into Jungkook&rsquo;s waist and smile smugly when he squirms under your touch. The three of you walk closer still until Jimin pauses just before the stairs. You know him so well&ndash; <i>So </i>extremely well that when his plump lips part and a dazzling grin graces his handsome face, when he respectfully dips his head toward the African woman on her porch, you know almost instantaneously that he&rsquo;s forcing it. And Jungkook, too, is forcing his smile as he bows lightly toward the woman. Really, they both look&hellip; <i>Nervous. </i>You&rsquo;re intrigued.</p><p>Jimin starts first.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, bibi&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>And all it takes is for her to say those four words for Park Jimin to shut his fucking mouth. You watch as he leans back, chewing his inner cheek as he nods pointlessly, a defeated expression on his face. Even Jungkook looks like he&rsquo;s been silenced and he never even said anything. You&rsquo;re amazed, honestly. Clearly, this woman commands a lot of respect already&ndash; You can tell by the way her plump lips stay in a tight line, how her dark eyes are so focused and how her gaze is strict, as if she takes <b><i>zero</i></b> bullshit. Really, its like she can see right through Jungkook and Jimin. Or maybe they just <i>really </i>pissed her off. Could be both, though.</p><p>&hellip;It&rsquo;s <i>probably</i> both.</p><p>&ldquo;That your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; You reply, a bit surprised when she suddenly addresses you. She looks just as powerful when she glares at you and you suddenly feel as meek as Jungkook and Jimin.</p><p>&ldquo;Your boyfriend,&rdquo; She asks again, but it&rsquo;s much less like a question and much more like a demand. She nods her head at Jimin and you jump, finally getting her question.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; You exclaim, scrambling for words as you wave your hands dismissively, &ldquo;No, Jimin and I, we, uh, we&rsquo;re just&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s your boyfriend, you should know he cheating on you,&rdquo; She announces immediately.</p><p>You <i>would</i> guess you took too long to answer her and that&rsquo;s why she phrased it that way <i>if </i>it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that she just said what she said. You stutter in your words, broken syllables falling from your lips as you quickly turn to look at Jimin. He looks caught and the funny part about it is that the two of you aren&rsquo;t even dating.</p><p>Jimin, embarrassed, scrambles for an explanation as he glances between you, Jungkook, and finally to Bibi.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, no, <i>bibi,&rdquo;</i> he chuckles nervously, &ldquo;Y/n and I aren&rsquo;t&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been livin&rsquo; here for fourteen years and in the last few months these children have been here, I&rsquo;ve seen every kind of girl you can imagine in and out that apartment. Its either you&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; &lsquo;round or you <i>must</i> be trying to raise an orphanage, cuz this is the sixth girl ive seen you with this week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin, oh my god&hellip;\"You mumble, <i>barely </i>keeping in your laughter. You fake like you&rsquo;re shocked, cupping your hand over your mouth. Then, in a twisted sort of way, you say, \"I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re <i>cheating</i> on me&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/n&ndash;&rdquo;</i> Jimin hisses, fucking exhausted. His eyes flare with a warning when he glares at you, but it&rsquo;s not like his three-foot tall self could beat your ass anyway, so the chances of you actually stopping are <i>very </i>low.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened, Jimin?&rdquo; You go on, faking total shock, &ldquo;In the parking lot just now, you were just talking about the part of you that still feels a <i>burning</i> <i>desire</i> to be with me? What happened to the part of you that <i>wants</i> me!?&rdquo;</p><p>You swear you see Jimin&rsquo;s eye twitch and you <i>know </i>for an absolute, complete <i>fact </i>he is already thinking of ways to get you back. He&rsquo;s probably considering lighting your precious clothes on fire which, by the way, is something he <i>has </i>done to you before. To which you responded by nearly setting the hay atop his head that he <i>claims </i>to be hair on fire. And you would&rsquo;ve fucking done it, too, but then his last roommate, a tall, giraffe legged motherfucker, grabbed you and you ended up fighting the <i>roommate</i> instead. Long story short, Jimin wound up completely physically fine and the only person who got hurt was his previous roommate, Namjoon, who ended with a black eye and then moved out. It worked in your favor though, because Jimin was so strapped on cash for <i><i>months</i></i><i> </i>afterward trying to pay for that whole apartment by himself that you felt like you&rsquo;d still gotten your revenge.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, bibi, we aren&rsquo;t <i>really</i> dating,&rdquo; Jimin tries to speak calmly.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Bibi cocks a brow, &ldquo;You lied when you told me your girlfriend was coming to town.&rdquo;</p><p>You snort audibly, but Bibi&rsquo;s quick glance has you shutting your big mouth. You mumble an apology, but really you&rsquo;re just <i>amazed </i>at how fucking <i>delusional</i> Jimin is as well as how&hellip; <i>blunt</i> Bibi is. Jimin lies and tells her you&rsquo;re his girlfriend stopping by for a visit, then Bibi, apparently aware of all the other girls Jimin&rsquo;s been fucking or whatever, tattles on him the <i>second </i>you arrive. It&rsquo;s fucking comical, honestly, but you must admit, you&rsquo;re starting to like this fierce old woman.</p><p>Jimin cringes, then drops his head and nods, &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Bibi just looks at him for a moment, her brows furrowed and lips parted in disgust, nearly. She then shakes her head and mumbles something, then waves Jimin off. She doesn&rsquo;t even need to say anything else, Jimin just murmurs a &ldquo;Goodbye, Bibi,&rdquo; and then rushes up the rest of the steps into the apartment. Bibi glances at Jungkook too, and Jungkook awkwardly follows in Jimin&rsquo;s steps and starts to leave. You&rsquo;re about to say bye and part ways as well when Bibi stops you. She holds up her hand to get your attention and you freeze.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; You tilt your head at her, &ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>She looks you over, as if deciding whether or not you&rsquo;re worth her breath, and then says&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sleep with that boy. The girl he was with yesterday had crabs.&rdquo;</p><p>And then she gets up and walks inside of her apartment, the door banging shut behind her.</p><p>You just stand there for a moment, your mouth agape until you hear Jungkook&rsquo;s voice call out to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n! Are you almost done talking to Bibi? I cooked and I really want us to sit down and eat together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; You turn and look up at Jungkook&rsquo;s expectant face. It takes you a split second to register Jungkook&rsquo;s words because Bibi&rsquo;s are still ringing in your ears, but you eventually do and nod.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-Yeah,&rdquo; You mumble, shaking your head as if to snap back into your normal self before Jungkook gets suspicious.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m, uh. Comin&rsquo; up now.&rdquo;</p><p>And then you grin.<br />And it&rsquo;s fake.<br />&hellip;And Jungkook can tell your grin is fake as hell, but he doesn&rsquo;t say anything when you make your way up and enter the apartment.</p><p>The place is neat and tidy. <i>Homey. </i>White walls peppered with photo after photo of Jungkook and Jimin together, of each of them separately, of Taehyung, and of Jimin and Jungkook&rsquo;s family as well. The furniture is worn, but far from decayed. It is comfortably warm inside as well but the heat is mostly stemming from the kitchen. Jimin, who watches you taking everything in with an attentively curious gaze, tugs on your jacket until you follow along and shrug it off of your shoulders. He hangs it up for you and as he does, you slip off into the kitchen. You pause, leaning against the wall for a moment to deeply inhale the scent from within. It&rsquo;s savory and sweet all at once, enough to have your stomach whining and mouthwatering. The sound of a spoon tapping against a pot calls you back to earth and you open your eyes to see Jungkook stirring the food.</p><p>&ldquo;I.. cooked a lot,&rdquo; He announces softly. <i>Embarrassed</i> is what he sounds like, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how much you would eat or what you even preferred, so I kind of got carried away.&rdquo;</p><p>He grins sheepishly, then turns to glance up at you, &ldquo;You <i>will</i> eat&hellip; right?&rdquo;</p><p>You gaze at him for a moment, then grin, a wave of adoration hitting you that makes you want to pinch his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. I could eat all this&ndash;&rdquo; You make a wide, general gesture out toward the kitchen, &ldquo;&ndash;And then some.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Jungkook exclaims.</p><p>By the soft flush to his cheeks and the way he gracefully checks the oven, he&rsquo;s clearly satisfied with your answer. But because you just <i>have </i>to fuck with people, you clear your throat and say&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Or not.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook freezes.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know~,&rdquo; You stretch flippantly, movements flamboyant and overdramatic, &ldquo;I might not <i>actually</i> be able to eat all of this after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Wait, no, why not?&rdquo; Jungkook presses, letting go of the spoon and leaving it in the pot. He looks distressed and you <i>know </i>you&rsquo;re being mean but you also&hellip; Don&rsquo;t care enough to stop. Besides, after all the times Jungkook teased <i>you </i>over shit, revenge is only necessary, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Are you not hungry? Or something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no. I&rsquo;m plenty hungry,&rdquo; You turn around, cross your hands behind your back and deliberately edge away from him, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook steps closer, tilting his head.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Just?&rdquo;</i> He urges.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the last time I checked, your cooking was&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>But your teasing quip is cut short when you suddenly hear a slightly feminine voice call out a groggy&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with all the noise? This is the second time you &rsquo;ve woken me up on one of my off days,&rdquo; She calls, her words tired and slurred with an accent you know well&ndash; Better than well, actually, its a sound burned into your very <i>soul</i> at this point.</p><p>You hear Jimin start to respond to her, but you&rsquo;re already in motion. You rush out of the kitchen, almost tripping as you round the corner until suddenly you see her physically before you. And there, just down the hall, is where she stands&ndash; In clear view is no one else besides Min Yoonji. Her jet black locks are silken and messy all the same, strands sticking out here and there. Those familiar dark eyes of hers are tired&ndash; <i><i>Hazy</i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i><i> </i>Her tone is sun-kissed yet so <i>pale</i> all at once, its as if she&rsquo;s fallen ill&hellip; Not like the Yoonji you once knew years back who&rsquo;s skin was as vibrant as&ndash; No, <i>rivaled with</i> a freshly bloomed flower. The woman is dressed in a long black tee that stops just above her knees, black socks on her feet, black bags under her eyes to match her atmosphere. It&rsquo;s a concoction of feelings that <i>rush </i>you when you see her, two of them very prominent all the same. One emotion is <i>pure,</i> <i>honest,</i> <i>childish</i> joy that stems from the very pit of your being the <i>moment </i>you lay eyes on her figure.</p><p>The second?</p><p>&hellip;Fear.</p><p>The last time you checked, Min Yoonji&ndash; <i>your </i>Min Yoonji did <i>not </i>look the way <i>this </i>Min Yoonji looks now. Staring at her sleek frame, her exhausted movements, you know she&rsquo;s changed and it&rsquo;s nowhere near for the better.</p><p>But you swallow it down, push that fear from your mind the moment you notice it and instead fall into excitement.</p><p>Yoonji looks&hellip; Shocked when she sees you. Her jaw falls slack, eyes blinking again and again as she gazes at you with hard, confused eyes. She even points at you, lips struggling to find words for a moment until all she says is&ndash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jimin just giggles, grinning, &ldquo;Y/n&rsquo;s stopping by for a visit,&rdquo; He explains simply.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here for the next few days,&rdquo; Jungkook continues seamlessly as he too appears from the kitchen, a towel in his grasp that he dries his hands on, &ldquo;We agreed not to tell you because Y/n wanted to surprise you.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Surpriseee~&rdquo;</i> You call, waving your hands like it&rsquo;s some big reveal, the cheekiest of grins on your face.</p><p>Yoonji&rsquo;s lips part and shut until finally, she finds a way to express her utter bewilderment and excitement. She rushes forward and you meet her halfway as she practically throws herself into your arms. You gasp when her chest slams into your own, stumbling back again as her arms wrap around your neck. Her grip is tight, her face nuzzled into your neck as quick, slurred comments on how much she&rsquo;s fucking missed you fall from her lips. You giggle, squeezing her terribly skinny frame back, but in all honesty, she&rsquo;s grown so <i>thin </i>you almost worry that you&rsquo;ll snap her in half if you squeeze her even the slightest bit too hard.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;</b></i><i><i><b>God,</b></i></i><i><i> I </i></i><i><i><i>missed </i></i></i><i><i><i><i>you&hellip;&rdquo; </i></i></i></i>Yoonji hisses the words in your ear, her nails digging into your flesh.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you, tooooo!&rdquo; You whine back, rocking the two of you from side to side.</p><p>In all honesty, the hug is far too short, but you and Min Yoonji are well aware of Jimin and Jungkook who stand closely behind. So you part ways just as quickly as you begin and suppress your feelings for now.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so nice to be with you all again,&rdquo; You remark, glancing at Jungkook&rsquo;s glimmering smile, Jimin&rsquo;s flushed cheeks, and then a quick glance at Yoonji&rsquo;s lips before you turn back to the boys, &ldquo;If I could be here all the time, I would&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should, then!&rdquo; Jimin exclaims, suddenly grabbing you by your hands and pulling toward the kitchen table, &ldquo;Stay with us! We&rsquo;d make some room for you!&rdquo;</p><p>Yoonji smirks, following along, &ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;d kick Jungkook&rsquo;s ass out and you can take his room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heeey!&rdquo;<i> </i>Jungkook retorts, glaring at your Yoonji, &ldquo;Why do <i>I </i>get kicked out? Why not Jimin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I can stand Jimin a <i>little </i>bit more than I can stand <i>you&ndash;&rdquo;</i></p><p>And then she jabs her pointed finger into Jungkook&rsquo;s chest for extra measure. The male whines, clutching his injured chest and you giggle at the sight. Still bickering and fussing as always&ndash; They really never changed. But the lack of change in your dynamic is warming, all the same. Even after leaving for months, you can still come home to the people you love and feel nothing but comfort.</p><p>The four of you take your seats at the roundtable, Yoonji on your left, Jungook on your right, and Jimin across. When Jungkook slips into the kitchen to make the plates of food, he calls Jimin in for his help. It&rsquo;s after the shorter male shoots you one of his dazzling smiles, sticks his tongue out at Yoonji, then dips off into the kitchen, you feel her hand come to squeeze your thigh. You catch her gaze for a moment, eyes hooded as you take in her form. Yoonji&rsquo;s face rests in her left hand as she gazes at you with soft eyes, blinking with the slow, carefulness of a feline. A million emotions stir within her shimmering gaze and you wonder how it is <i>possible </i>for one person to carry stars in their eyes. You gaze down at her hand, at the bony joints and slender fingers that clutch the plump flesh of your thigh. Her hands have always been big, and you&rsquo;ve always loved the way they look wrapped around your own, how they feel when they clutch your cheeks&hellip;</p><p>You laugh then when you feel the urge to kiss her hit you strong and you&rsquo;re suddenly too embarrassed to even look at her anymore. Your skin, soft and supple, <i>burns </i>where her palm lingers&ndash; <i>Taunting </i>you with the sensation. Far too long has it been since the two of you seen each other last, and now that the two of you are finally together, holding back for the sake of Jimin and Jungkook is borderline hellish. The two of you are lesbians, after all, <i>closeted </i>lesbians, and neither one of you are ready to come out. Even with the two boys, there is always that fear that you&rsquo;ll be looked at <i>differently </i>for admitting to being lovers&ndash; It already didn&rsquo;t go well with either one of your parents. Yoonji&rsquo;s momma practically disowned her when Yoonji came out to her some years ago, and your mother <i>claims</i> she doesn&rsquo;t think of you any differently now, but you <i>know </i>she does. So after coming out to people who claimed to love you unconditionally only to run head-first into a condition, why risk it again?</p><p>These thoughts swim in your mind, a mixture of sadness and bitterness accompanying them. Your mood shifts and Yoonji knows it does&ndash; It&rsquo;s like she can read the very hazy, fearful words on your mind despite you having said nothing. Her grip on your thigh tightens until you turn to look at her, and its like she can hear every little thought running through your head. She blinks and there&rsquo;s a little bit more <i>focus </i>and <i>anxiety </i>in her gaze, mixing in with her adoration towards you.</p><p><i>&ldquo;</i><i><i>It&rsquo;s</i></i><i><i><i> </i></i></i><i><i><i><i>okay</i></i></i></i><i><i><i>.</i></i></i><i>&rdquo;</i></p><p>It the words that her little lips silently whisper when they part and suddenly you feel like everything <i>is </i>okay again. That&rsquo;s the power of Min Yoonji&ndash; Better yet, it just may be the power that coexists between two lovers, but you know Yoonji would tease you for saying something as cheesy as that. So, with the suddenness of rain on a sunny day, you&rsquo;re fine again.<br />For now, at least.</p><p>Jungkook and Jimin return and Yoonji&rsquo;s hand falls from your thigh with slickness and ease that has you wishing it was back again. But you&rsquo;re thankful for it all the same because Jungkook and Jimin are utterly clueless to it. Dishes clatter and empty stomachs sing as the tantalizing scent of food harass each of you. You sing your compliments to Jungkook, to which he beams brighter than the sun in response to. Then eagerly, you devour the meal before you, joyful conversation filling the air as a sense of peace befalls you.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a happy, pleasant atmosphere that lingers during the meal, after it is over, when you all watch a movie together, and then finally when the sun gives her final goodbyes and leaves with her lover, Moon, taking her place with grace and class. Jungkook and Jimin apologize and excuse themselves to their room since they both have early shifts the next day, hug and pepper your cheeks in playfully sloppy kisses (an action to which you notice Yoonji dislikes, you see it in the way her eyes slide to the side, how her gaze dims, how her hands tighten) and then suddenly, its only you and Yoonji.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll be sleeping in her room for the next bit you&rsquo;re here and honestly, the arrangement is perfect for the two of you. Into her room you and she go, the door clicking softly shut behind you. You pause, turning back to lock the door and as you do, you can feel Yoonji hovering near. She&rsquo;s always been <i>hot</i>&ndash; Temperature-wise, that is. So when her warm hands clutch your cool arms, when soft, heated lips press themselves to the back of your icy neck, and when a soft groan falls from her lips and makes the hair on your entire being stand up, you freeze. You soak it in, soak in the way it feels so familiar to have her pressing against you like this. Her hands drop to your hips as she practically pins you against the door, a sigh dripping from you like sap from a tree. You feel like you are burning as you manage to turn around, meeting your lovers gaze with unsteady eyes. She&rsquo;s closer now, closer for you to look at and you see it clear as day.</p><p><i>She is not well.</i></p><p>Yoonji, oblivious, leans forward on the tips of her toes and attempts to kiss you, but you stop her when your hands suddenly clutch her cheeks. She freezes, her head laying heavy in your grip. You almost can&rsquo;t believe it, the dramatic change that your girl has gone through, but you know trauma changes a person. So you pull her close and run your fingers through her hair, plant a kiss to her cheek, then softly whisper&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoonji hesitates but pulls back to stare you in your eyes. She inches out of your grip and you notice her fear.</p><p>&ldquo;Are&hellip; Are we breaking up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; You say, an airy, lifeless, laugh with your words, &ldquo;But this <i>is</i> about you, baby&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You slide past, taking a seat on the edge of her bed and patting the space next to you. Yoonji follows obediently, sitting so close her thigh touches yours. You grab her hands and hold them in your own, staring at the veins pumping blood beneath the flesh. You&rsquo;ve always loved those hands of hers, they&rsquo;re probably your favorite trait on her besides her, well&hellip; Her everything. You plant kisses to the tips of each finger until you&rsquo;ve done all ten, until you realize Yoonji&rsquo;s eyes are glazed over like she&rsquo;s a million miles away or like she may even pass out right then and there. You snap your own fingers and she clicks back into awareness so suddenly that it frightens you.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Yoonji asks as if nothing happened, imploring you to reply and finally talk, &ldquo;Cat got your tongue?&rdquo;</p><p>She means it as a joke but you can&rsquo;t even fake a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Yoonji,&rdquo; You start softly, &ldquo;How are you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You pause, take in a deep breath to halt the stinging of tears in your eyes, then force out the words.</p><p><i>&ldquo;How have you been since Yoongi and Hoseok died?&rdquo;</i></p><p>It&rsquo;s a question Yoonji doesn&rsquo;t know how to answer.<br /></p></p>",
