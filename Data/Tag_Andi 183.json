His mouth falls agape, though, as he stares at Amber.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSpin the <i>bottle</i>?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi leans a little more on Amber, laughs nervously, then laughs with more certainty. \u201cNo, spin the baby tater. Of course spin the bottle!\u201d Cyrus gives her a worried look, putting a noticeable space between himself and TJ, who runs to the lights and flicks them back on.</p><p>\tBuffy offers no comment, just taps Jonah\u2019s shoulder so she\u2019ll let him down. Then she accidentally bumps shoulders with him as they stumble over to the couch and sit down next to each other. Jonah feels the nerves on his skin stand up at the wisp of contact: a quiet shock.</p><p>\tStill stepping around fairy lights, Andi whispers something furtively to Amber, who bites her lip and shrugs. Then, regaining her composure, she smiles and runs back over to the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWho has a bottle? A water bottle\u2014uh, Buffy? You\u2019re a runner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tBuffy raises her eyebrows but pulls a water bottle from seemingly out of nowhere with no visible reluctance. It\u2019s silvery and dented and clearly not meant for playing spin the bottle in basements, but then again they\u2019re not exactly meant for this either. Jonah glances around the room, and tallies: TJ has never dated anyone, Cyrus and TJ probably like each other, Buffy hasn\u2019t dated anyone except Marty, Amber doesn\u2019t seem to date anymore, as a rule, Andi had Walker and Jonah and then no one else every again, and Jonah\u2014</p><p>\tIt occurs to Jonah that he\u2019s dated the most people out of everyone in this room. And that he\u2019s kissed not one, but three girls.</p><p>\tIt also occurs to him that the first and only girl who has made him understand the expression <i>butterflies in your stomach</i> is sitting in this room. Next to him. Holding a bottle.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay!\u201d Amber shouts, snatching the bottle from Buffy and depositing it on the coffee table in front of the couch. Cyrus hastily picks up the remnants of the cinnamon cookies, glancing at TJ, then chucks them in the corner. Neither of the Kippens comment, and Amber continues speaking. \u201cSo\u2026.\u201d she sighs. \u201cWe should probably not do the lips, considering only, what\u2014two?\u2014of the people in this room have had their first kiss?\u201d</p><p>\tEyes flash to Jonah, and to Andi. Jonah feels Buffy watching him from his left, but he doesn\u2019t react. He meets Andi\u2019s eyes across the couch, who is grinning sheepishly. They\u2019ve talked about it\u2014awkwardly\u2014before: how they\u2019re first kiss was in middle school, and strangely spontaneous, and in plain view of several other people.\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah remembers another kiss\u2014then winces at the memory. It was his last kiss with Kira, under fluorescent roller skating lights. Two weeks later Jonah\u2019s stray physics homework and skateboard stickers had been evicted from Kira\u2019s house, and Jonah was no longer welcome at the Jefferson high school girls basketball games. Buffy had consoled him, which had always felt like a big thing: Buffy choosing Jonah over Kira. But maybe she wasn\u2019t, because Kira and Buffy still kept their tentative, basketball-centric, passive-aggressive friendship around.\u00a0</p><p>\tMaybe it didn\u2019t matter. Jonah wanted his slate to be wiped clean. He wanted to be like Amber or Cyrus tonight, never having kissed someone and still dying to find out. He wanted\u2014</p><p>\tLike a pesky firefly, a thought pricked at his mind: he wanted Buffy to have been his first.</p><p>\tBut this is what he gets, tonight. Buffy leans a little into him, still shaping a smile at Andi: her best friend. Then, finally, she speaks:</p><p>\t\u201cIf two people spin each other twice, seven minutes in heaven.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAmber lets out a scream of excitement, twisting in her seat. \u201cPerfect\u2014wait, one more thing.\u201d She jumps from the couch and hurries back to the light switch, flipping it and leaving the room in suspended darkness, pinpointed with various strings of light. There\u2019s enough light to see the faces of each person sitting around the couch, in this order: Jonah, Buffy, Amber, Andi, Cyrus, TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI better not spin you, Driscoll,\u201d TJ says jokingly, in a way that says he asking for forgiveness, for the tenth or twentieth or fiftieth time. Part of Jonah wants TJ to say something to him with the same look in his eyes, because Jonah is sick and tired of wanting move on from middle school things\u2014it\u2019s why he went with TJ to get the decorations, it\u2019s why he likes to spend time around Buffy and TJ together: because they\u2019re all forgiving each other, in their own ways, for what happened months and years ago.</p><p>\tJonah knows, also, that part of the reconciliation is on his shoulders. And that it\u2019s not a thing for here, tonight.</p><p>\tBuffy scoffs at TJ\u2019s remark, but Jonah sees that she\u2019s smiling.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIf I spin Jonah, we have to remake the moment in the Red Rooster,\u201d Andi says, and Jonah blinks in surprise.</p><p>\t\u201cSo we\u2019ll have to do it awkwardly with everyone watching?\u201d</p><p>\tAndi chucks a pillow at him, and Jonah lets out a breath like a laugh. He\u2019s glad, then, that they can joke like this.</p><p>\t\u201cActually,\u201d Amber says, with a realization, \u201cthree people in this room have had their first kiss.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cFour,\u201d Cyrus interrupts, frowning. \u201cI had\u2014I mean, Iris kissed me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ shifts in his seat.</p><p>\t\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Buffy says, sitting up from her laid back position. \u201cRaise your hand if you\u2019ve had your first kiss.</p><p>\tJonah and Andi are the first to place their hands in the air. Then Cyrus, following his prior statement. Then\u2014TJ?</p><p>\tBuffy and Amber are left with their hands down and mouths working. But Jonah looks over at TJ, thinking about how he\u2019s never had a girlfriend. Never had a boyfriend, either.</p><p>\t\u201cTJ?\u201d Andi says, as if reading Jonah\u2019s mind.</p><p>\tHe shrugs and leans back. Amber glances over at\u2014Jonah, of all people, but then shakes her head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re still not doing lips. Not unless you both want to.\u201d</p><p>\tCyrus nods in assent, and it\u2019s decided.\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah is so close to Buffy. And he\u2019s holding his breath. He doesn\u2019t know if he wants her to spin him or not, him to spin her or not, for the two of them to end up facing each other in a Kippen closet. Because Jonah doesn\u2019t want to also have to face an awful truth that might exist: that Buffy would never, ever like him.</p><p>\tBuffy bumps his shoulder, and he bumps back, heartbeat fluttering. There\u2019s cookies and lights and singing, and then there is Buffy\u2019s shoulder brushing his. Two different planes of existence.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll spin first!\u201d Andi calls out, breaking the silence. Jonah sees the last glance she gives Amber, ripe with something in the curve of her eyebrows and quirk of her mouth. Then she steps to the bottle, grips the neck, and spins it around and around and around and\u2014</p><p>\tWhen it stops, it\u2019s pointing directly at him.</p><!-- more --><p>\u2014\u00a0</p><p>\tBuffy watches her best friend spin the boy sitting next to her, and she manages to maintain her calm. Andi and Jonah\u2014old news. Jonah hitches a breath, shakes his head, then leans over and lets Andi peck his cheek. It\u2019s too much like the first Red Rooster kiss, feeling anticlimactic yet so exposed. When Jonah sits back, he doesn\u2019t look at Buffy.</p><p>\tBuffy, who doesn\u2019t blush, as a rule, can feel her face turning red.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, then. Next?\u201d Amber says, nodding in Jonah\u2019s direction. Buffy eyes the bottle intently, as he tips it around in a circle. She wonders, for a moment, if Andi and Jonah would kiss in the closet if he spun it back around to Andi.\u00a0</p><p>\tCommon sense, for once, cuts into her mind and reminds her of a simple fact: Andi is head over heels for Amber. Jonah is\u2014</p><p>\tWell, Jonah is a question mark.</p><p>\tIn the split second while Buffy considers all of this, the bottle swings nearly 360 degrees and lands, with no hesitation, facing her.</p><p>\t\u201cLovebirds!\u201d TJ calls out, but Buffy doesn\u2019t hear him. Her heart is beating too fast.</p><p>\tJonah, who looks only slightly ruffled, leans in, and, quick as a feather or a snowflake, dusts her cheek with a kiss. It takes Buffy longer than half a second to jerk away at the unexpectedness. Then, because she\u2019s tired of being ashamed, she turns to meet Jonah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cNext time, warn me before you lean in, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Next time</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\tBuffy doesn\u2019t know why she says it, except she definitely knows why she says it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhatever you say, Slayer,\u201d Jonah says, a beat too late, and nudges her shoulder.</p><p>\tIt feels like a moment. It feels like something.</p><p>\tWhile Amber pushes the bottle over toward her, Buffy replays several things in her head all at once:<br/><i>One:</i> the day she met Jonah Beck. It was before Andi and the Good Hair Crew all latched onto him. It was before frisbee lessons with Bex and bracelets and all of that. Buffy had been walking home from Jefferson, crossing the fields where the Space Otters were practicing. A younger version of the Jonah next to her now had thrown a frisbee at her feet, eyebrows enticing. Sharp and suspicious and so very Buffy-like, she had picked it up and turned it over in her hands. Jonah finally reached out to take it, and she pulled it back, then threw it over his head to the girl behind him, who caught it squarely in her hands. \u201cJonah,\u201d he said, then, and she nodded. It wasn\u2019t until Andi introduced them later, and their paths crossed truly, that she lent him back her name. And it wasn\u2019t until months later, when the trust was real between them, that she gave her name to him, to have and share and keep as friends.</p><p>\t<i>Two: </i>the day Marty almost kissed her. It was like clockwork at that point: Buffy flopped down on the futon in Marty\u2019s room, unlaced her running shoes, and started on her physics homework. Marty spun around in his chair, tapping a pen against his chin, and attempted math homework while actually looking up runners on <i>milesplit.com</i>. It had been a Tuesday, that much she remembered. She asked Marty to come help her with something, and he trailed over, with tired eyes. They were sitting next to her, and Buffy felt something like a warm energy swelling inside her. She had <i>liked </i>Marty: ferociously, confidently, after their middle school falling out, for almost all of ninth grade. She couldn\u2019t deny it, any more than she could deny the way her heartbeat skipped when Jonah\u2019s kissed her cheek. But back then\u2014she wasn\u2019t ready, even then, to kiss anyone. It was hard to know if she ever would be\u2014sure, kisses on cheek and holding hands and arms around each other were all wonderful. But a kiss, on the lips? When Marty leaned in, Buffy\u2019s heart skipped, but not in a good way. She felt something essential break between them, just as she had two years earlier when Marty left her on the bridge. And it couldn\u2019t be the same again, and it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\t<i>Three</i>: the feeling in her stomach moments ago when Jonah pecked her on the cheek. Bumped her arm. Carried her on his shoulders so she could throw glittery pieces of paper at the ceiling. Days ago, ate baby taters in the booth across from her. She doesn\u2019t need to explain it any more; it\u2019s there.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s there, and he bumped her shoulder.</p><p>\tBuffy spins the bottle, and, because the world is just <i>like that</i>, it lands on the person sitting nearly directly across from her: TJ Kippen.</p><p>\t\u201cNope.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s the rules of the game,\u201d Andi says, holding back a laugh.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to kiss TJ Kippen,\u201d Buffy announces, standing up in her seat, \u201cthen you\u2019ve got\u2014ah\u2014\u201c<br/>\n\tBuffy stops when TJ himself gets up, runs over, jumps on the couch, and pecks her on the cheek, all in about two seconds, looking annoyingly pleased with himself. TJ shakes his head once he does it, and Buffy gags, fake retching over the side of the couch. She doesn\u2019t look down at Jonah\u2019s face\u2014she\u2019s not sure she wants to see it.</p><p>\t\u201cGross!\u201d she yells at TJ\u2019s retreating figure, back over to Cyrus, who gives him a tentative high five.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot as gross as you!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re the one who <i>kissed </i>me!\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cWell were you going to do it?\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSettle down,\u201d Amber says, grinning. She glances at Andi; so much of their conversation seems to be in exchanges like that, small looks and knowing eyes. Buffy notices; how could she not?</p><p>\t\u201cNope. I need to go wash my mouth out,\u201d Buffy insists, hopping off the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe didn\u2019t even\u2014\u201c TJ protests. Buffy throws him a look, and runs off to the sink.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tThe tint of pinpoint lights and the sparkle of the snow outside the window are starting to hurt Cyrus\u2019s eyes. Otherwise in the dark, he\u2019s snuggled in the couch next to TJ, neither of them saying much. He keeps replaying the moment in his head, over and over: a pinky linked to his, two palms against each other, fingers interlocked. He keeps going back to how TJ was the one who curled his pinky over Cyrus\u2019s, how TJ was the one whose heartbeat he felt beating in sync with his in the contact of their wrists.</p><p>\tNow, they sit only inches apart, but their hands are separate.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe wishes he could know what TJ is thinking right now. He wishes he knew what <i>he </i>is thinking right now. Feelings, Cyrus has learned, are difficult.</p><p>\tActually, difficult is a poor way to put it. It\u2019s something more than difficult to know someone for three years, to know them <i>well</i> for two, and to have feelings for approximately two\u2014maybe more, maybe less. It\u2019s impossible, almost, to hang out and sleepover and talk and text for hours and <i>hold hands </i>with the boy he\u2019s so desperately enamored with, and to never say the words out loud. To Buffy and Andi, who spill back about their crushes (well, Buffy doesn\u2019t, but Cyrus figures she\u2019s figuring out how to manage the past with Marty and the future with Jonah), to them it\u2019s easy. But he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll ever say it out loud to TJ. Or if he ever wants to.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cEarth to Cyrus!\u201d Andi says, and he\u2019s back in the land of the living. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spun.\u201d<br/>\n\tCyrus nods, sleepily, then glances down at the bottle. Pointing at him, accusingly. He glances up, counts off in his head what\u2019s occurred so far. Then\u2014</p><p>\t<i>Crap.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>TJ Kippen is looking over at him, uneasily. Everyone else is smiling at them, but Cyrus can\u2019t see them. He sees TJ, who doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do. It feels like he\u2019s nervous, which can\u2019t possibly be true\u2014he just kissed Buffy Driscoll with apparently no regard for his own life. But he\u2019s hesitating now.</p><p>\tEvery time something happens that might just means TJ could possibly like him, Cyrus feels his heart smiling inside.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cGo on,\u201d someone whispers across the circle. And so TJ does, and Cyrus\u2019s shoulders bristle and his mind goes blank and his stomach fills with violently present butterflies and TJ kisses him about two inches from his lips.</p><p>\tAnd Cyrus, who was trying to maintain calm, feels a supernova explode from that point. A small one, but a supernova nonetheless. It\u2019s the sting of the nerves and the warmth of his skin that reminds him (as if he didn\u2019t know already) that this is something he likes, that this boy in front of him is cute and attractive and magnetic.\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus is the one to pull away, because his erratic breathing is giving him away. (In the back of his head, he thinks: <i>and that was only on the cheek</i>.) But he puts that thought away, and falls back, breathless next to TJ, who looks a little sick and a lot happy.</p><p>\tHe misses the knowing look between Andi and Buffy, as if they\u2019re his wingwomen, and the smile Amber gives Jonah, because all of them ship this more than anything. Cyrus misses it, because he\u2019s thinking about TJ.</p><p>\tHe wants to say something, but what is there to say? So he doesn\u2019t, just silently takes the bottle in his hand and pauses only a moment before giving it a half-hearted spin.</p><p>\tBowie Quinn, Cyrus thinks, as the bottle slows to a stop, is right about the universe.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe cap is directed, irrefutably, toward the only one in the room Cyrus was afraid he would spin.</p><p>\t\u201cCloset!\u201d Buffy yells, and Cyrus thinks of the irony of it.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything\u2019s almost like a dream: the fairy lights, Andi\u2019s encouraging smile, TJ getting to his feet and stumbling over to the closet, followed by Cyrus. Everything\u2019s a haze, because this is not what Cyrus thought would happen tonight\u2014just the two of them, alone in a closet. A closet!<br/>\n\tCyrus nearly doesn\u2019t make it the door. It\u2019s not an overstatement to say his vision might be a little blurry. Or maybe that\u2019s the dark.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen they both go in the closet and shut the door, it\u2019s still dark.</p><p>\tCyrus doesn\u2019t allow himself to think it too loudly, but he\u2019s <i>hoping.</i></p><p><i>\u2014</i></p><p><i>\t</i>TJ\u2019s mind short-circuited when he kissed Cyrus\u2019s cheek. TJ\u2019s mind short-circuited on his math final only days ago. TJ\u2019s mind stopped functioning for a moment when the Jefferson girls\u2019 basketball team won the championship last year, and Buffy Driscoll actually gave his broken-ACL-crutches self a <i>hug</i>.</p><p>\tHe\u2019s thanking his lucky stars that somehow, his mind is working right now.</p><p>\tCyrus\u2019s cheeks are still a little red, and TJ knows his are too, especially after the second spin. They walk to the closet, around the corner and out of sight of the rest of everyone.</p><p>\t\u201cI guess we\u2019re the lucky ones, huh?\u201d TJ says, holding the closet door open for Cyrus, who nods but doesn\u2019t say anything in return. Once the door swings shut, they\u2019re left in utter darkness. TJ swears softly and fumbles around the walls, searching for the switch. It\u2019s his house\u2014he really should know where the closet light is. But it\u2019s Cyrus who finds it, tugging on a string suspended from the ceiling and gazing over at TJ with dark eyes.</p><p>\tTJ wants, and he wants, and he wants. He wants with his eyes open and shut and when Cyrus looks over at him he almost kisses him then and there.</p><p>\tBut the two of them settle across from each other in the crowded closet, on opposite sides. TJ picks a spot on the wall just above Cyrus to rest his eyes.</p><p>\tSilence flickers for a moment before Cyrus shuffles and crosses the room to stand next to him. Cyrus, ever the brave one, always the strong one. TJ is so proud; there\u2019s not a drop of jealousy left in him. There used to be, back in middle school, when Cyrus had both Buffy and Andi and TJ had no one except maybe Reed. But it\u2019s all gone.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe light above them blinks, and in the space between darkness and light, TJ\u2019s hand ends up pressed against Cyrus\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t know how it happens, but it does. Like earlier, their hands intertwine, pressed together, and pull their sides against each other. TJ feels his breathing go shallow. When was the moment that Cyrus could first make him breathless? Maybe at the swings that second time. Maybe when he went to Cyrus\u2019s house and they sat, inches apart, watching made-for-tv movies last winter. Maybe every time they almost held hands, and the twice now that they truly have. And still are.</p><p>\tMinutes stack on top of each other and pile up, and TJ begins to realize he may be running out of time. For what? He can\u2019t exactly shape his intentions in his mind. But he knows.</p><p>\tAfter what seems like an eternity, Cyrus\u2019s hand twitches in his, and TJ decides he can\u2019t keep waiting, just like when he first pushed his hand into Cyrus\u2019s. He swings around, looking over at Cyrus, who looks back, almost afraid.</p><p>\tTheir faces are nearly touching, illuminated in the dusty closet light and opposites in a photographic negative.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus says, so delicately, like he could break the word with too much force. TJ\u2019s heart is flickering, fluttering, existing. \u201cDid you\u2014did you want to do seven minutes in heaven?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ sees the question break his face, sees Cyrus begin to ask himself why he said it. But TJ, again, sees the bravery splayed across his nervous mouth and endless eyes. His heartbeat hammers in his chest; it wants out.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe squeezes Cyrus\u2019s hand, and it\u2019s warm. \u201cOnly with you.\u201d</p><p>\tIt feels like the bravest thing he\u2019s ever said.</p><p>\tIt feels like the heartbeat in Cyrus\u2019s wrist is screaming against his.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt feels like something he was missing is almost, almost there.</p><p>\tHe sees Cyrus smile, and he sees the hand in his move upwards as the body attached to it shifts towards him. Instinctively, he closes his eyes.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s Cyrus who pulled him out of the dark, when his parents and his friends and the awfulness inside him were drowning him and he couldn\u2019t breathe. It\u2019s Cyrus who listened, who <i>listened</i> and was there for him always and ever. It\u2019s Cyrus who held him while he choked on tears in ninth grade, having discovered his knee no longer wanted to function as a knee for nine months. It\u2019s Cyrus who knows the stories of his parents and his grandparents and his sister and his loneliness. It\u2019s Cyrus who reached out and took that loneliness from him. It\u2019s Cyrus who matters. And it\u2019s Cyrus, then, who pushes the last few inches\u2014they\u2019re so<i> close</i>\u2014and breathes into reality what was meant to be all this time.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s Cyrus who grips TJ\u2019s hand and kisses him, sweet and simple, all at once.</p><p>\tIn less than a second, Cyrus pulls back, and he\u2019s still close enough that TJ can feel his measured breath and taste the anxiousness. His brows are drawn together, dark eyes worried, as if he\u2019s made a mistake.\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ wants that look gone from Cyrus\u2019s face.</p><p>\tHe lets go of Cyrus\u2019s hand and wraps his arms around him, embracing him tightly as Cyrus finally relaxes. He holds him, he holds him, he holds him, like the world is new and this is all he knows. He holds Cyrus like it\u2019s been three years in the making, because it has.</p><p>\tCyrus is crying, crying and breathing: exhaling, finally. And eventually TJ pulls back from the embrace, only because he has something else he needs to do. Cyrus rubs his eyes, still gazing up at TJ, waiting for one of them to say something.</p><p>\tTJ doesn\u2019t have anything to say, now. But he crosses the distance between them once again, because he needs to, because he wants to. And this time, when they kiss, no one pulls away.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s muffins and it\u2019s swings and it\u2019s somersaults and it\u2019s hidden smiles and it\u2019s long phone calls and it\u2019s happiness, happiness, happiness.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tAmber is still laughing, watching TJ and Cyrus follow each other, mesmerized, into the closet. But everyone else looks on in wonder and maybe jealousy, wishing for <i>something.</i> Amber wants <i>something</i> too, but she doesn\u2019t want to allow herself to think about it.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Andi asks finally. \u201cIt\u2019s no one\u2019s turn.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou can spin,\u201d Amber interrupts, running a hand through her hair. \u201cI\u2019ll just assume we won\u2019t get either of them out of there for a while.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShould we set a timer, though?\u201d Jonah asks, already reaching for his phone. Amber shrugs and so Jonah sets it anyway, the seconds ticking away.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi picks up the bottle, tosses it around in her hands a few times, much to Buffy\u2019s chagrin. Then she drops it on the table, spinning it quickly and delicately. Amber watches Andi\u2019s hands tip the bottle, almost like she\u2019s piecing together the parts of a puzzle or a craft. And she watches Andi\u2019s spin push the bottle around seven times until it ends up, somehow unsurprisingly, pointing at Amber.</p><p>\tAmber has come to expect this. She thinks of their moment in the kitchen, hours ago, and wonders if Andi will even remember it tomorrow. She thinks about how Andi kissed Jonah so easily. She lets her own insecurity wash over her, because it\u2019s almost easier than thinking the possibility she hopes for could be true.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPucker up,\u201d Andi says jokingly, and Amber considers how bold Andi has become in the past year. Part of Amber thinks it\u2019s her own fault (not that she minds the change).\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi leans over, grinning, and kisses Amber on the cheek. It lasts half a second longer than the rest of the kisses, but it\u2019s hard for Amber to think anything of it. Not when Andi does it so casually, and flourishes her movements after the fact, grinning. It\u2019s even harder for Amber to imagine that Andi could kiss someone she had romantic feelings for like it\u2019s nothing.</p><p>\tAnd Amber has seen this before: it\u2019s the air that gay girls breathe. Friendships so deep they might as well be romances, but to one half of the pairing, they could never be. Texting late into the night, sharing anything and everything, even holding hands. Amber doesn\u2019t want that to be what\u2019s between her and Andi; she really, desperately doesn\u2019t. But she thinks of the unspoken jokes between them, of text threads that extend into tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd she takes the bottle, not wanting to let herself keep thinking.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey Amber,\u201d Buffy says suddenly. \u201cRemember when Cyrus forced us to have a therapy session to reconcile?\u201d</p><p>\tAmber winces, because memories of that come with memories of things she and Andi have already put behind them: ferris wheels and marker hearts and hatred.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, I remember. We hated each other,\u201d she responds carefully. Beside her, Andi studies the couch, contemplating.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Buffy says, all too suddenly again. \u201cFor hating you for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\tIt\u2019s the strangest apology, out of place and in the wrong time. They\u2019ve made up dozens of times before, or they wouldn\u2019t be here, in the same house, about to have a sleepover.</p><p>\tAnd yet.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Amber says, softer than she\u2019s ever said most anything. \u201cI was awful, and I should\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>\tAndi is looking directly at Jonah, unable to take a side in this. So Amber keeps her gaze locked on Buffy\u2019s, who looks\u2014gentler. More open.</p><p>\t\u201cI just wanted to say it,\u201d Buffy says, \u201cso we can finally, finally move on.\u201d</p><p>\tAmber smiles, then. \u201cLook at us. Cyrus had to bring us in for relationship therapy and now we\u2019re all helping him and TJ\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cHang out,\u201d Jonah cuts in, with a grin. Amber imagines if her brother were here, the reconciliation might finally be complete: Buffy and TJ, TJ and Jonah, Jonah and Amber, Amber and Buffy. But TJ\u2019s not here, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s enough to know that Andi\u2019s best friend\u2014that <i>Buffy</i>\u2014forgives her. That she wants to move on.</p><p>\t\u201cTime to spin the bottle?\u201d Buffy asks, hopefully. Amber is struck, suddenly, with how the spiky outer shell of middle-school Buffy has softened into kindness and strength.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou got it.\u201d Amber drops the bottle in the middle and spins it. And spins it and spins it until:</p><p>\t\u201cI guess we really are throwing it back,\u201d Andi laughs, the first word she\u2019s spoken in a few minutes. The bottle declares her destiny, with no regrets: Jonah Beck.</p><p>\tJonah Beck: the only boy to ever catch Amber Kippen\u2019s eye. Jonah Beck: a question mark. Jonah Beck: certainly not who she wanted to be kissing tonight.</p><p>\tStill, Amber leans across Buffy to peck Jonah on the cheek. She wants it to be nothing, but she also wants it to be something final. Something Andi can see and know: the past is past. All of it.</p><p>\tAs Amber leans back, and Jonah makes no expression at all, Amber thinks about how things from so long ago still affect them today. She doesn\u2019t want eighth grade Amber, the one who was struggling so badly with her parents that she lashed out at everyone around her, to be the one they all remember. The one who comes to mind. And she\u2019s been trying to erase that version of herself for so long\u2014over two years.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s worn out and cliche, but Amber\u2019s so tired of being the mean girl. She wonders if apologizing to Buffy and kissing Jonah Beck is enough. She wonders if anything will ever be enough.</p><p>\t\u201cMy turn,\u201d Jonah says hurriedly, cutting the silence. He spins it again, and lands on\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014Buffy.\u00a0</p><p>\tAmber\u2019s suspected the both of them for long enough, and as they go off into the closet, Andi also wears a smug smile. And then it\u2019s just the two of them: Amber and Andi. Isn\u2019t it always?</p><p>\tMoments after Jonah and Buffy leave, the timer on Buffy\u2019s phone goes off, signifying the end of TJ and Cyrus\u2019s seven minutes. Andi gives Amber a look that asks: <i>are you going to go get them?</i> Amber gives her back a look that says: <i>no, are you crazy?</i> Andi deactivates the alarm in agreement. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow do you think they\u2019re doing?\u201d Amber asks out loud.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly? Thriving,\u201d Andi says. \u201cI hope Jonah and Buffy are too.\u201d There\u2019s something unspoken there: the last two left.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd us?\u201d Amber asks.</p><p>\t\u201cTired,\u201d Andi admits. \u201cDrained from finals. Full of peanut butter sandwiches and cinnamon cookies.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTired?\u201d Amber says, like it\u2019s a shock. \u201cIt\u2019s only about ten thirty, and you never sleep\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI never sleep,\u201d Andi agrees. \u201cBut suddenly I feel like I could sleep for days. Maybe it was the snow this morning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMayhaps someone made too many snow angels?\u201d Amber asks.</p><p>\t\u201cMayhaps <i>someone</i> threw about a hundred snowballs at me.\u201d</p><p>\tAmber reaches up and swats at one of the stray strings of light above their heads. \u201cHow long do you think the snow\u2019s going to last?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBex and I have decided two days at the most. Enough time to go to the alpine slide.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThe alpine slide?? In the snow?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJust a little tradition I have with my parents. Buffy, Cyrus, and I used to go in the fall but we haven\u2019t since\u2026 a certain disaster.\u201d</p><p>\tAndi leans back on Amber\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou know, spin the bottle doesn\u2019t make much sense if everyone ends up in the closet at once\u2014wait a minute, which closet did Jonah and Buffy go in? If TJ and Cyrus are in the other ones?\u201d</p><p>\tAmber shrugs. \u201cThe second dimension one. They\u2019re actually both in the same closet at once, but in different metaphysical spaces.\u201d</p><p>\tTurning around to look directly at Amber, inches away from her nose, Andi narrows her eyes. \u201cEither you\u2019re on drugs or you\u2019re a nerd.\u201d<br/>\n\tAmber stretches back: anything to get away from Andi\u2019s very present bright eyes and tiny smile. \u201cTJ\u2019s the nerd, not me.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cDrugs it is, then.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou got me,\u201d Amber mumbles, fading off. And then, like a scene from a dream, Andi reaches up and twirls a strand of Amber\u2019s hair between her fingers, eyes half-lidded.</p><p>\t\u201cI <i>am</i> tired,\u201d Andi asserts. Amber keeps holding her breath.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you fall asleep on me, I\u2019ll draw a mustache on your face,\u201d Amber teases, and Andi stops twirling her hair, turns around and tilts her chin up so she\u2019s staring right at Amber.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you draw a mustache on my face, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Andi, for once, comes up short of words.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d Amber asks, smiling. If Andi can flirt like it\u2019s nothing, then so can she. She winks down at Andi. \u201cThrow snowballs at me?\u201d</p><p>\tAndi sighs and rolls her eyes, but she\u2019s grinning too. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll put snow in your sleeping bag. There.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll craft me to death?\u201d Amber continues, ignoring Andi\u2019s remark.</p><p>\t\u201cHey! You\u2019ve already seen my baking skills, which include wielding a large wooden spoon. Don\u2019t test me.\u201dAndi scrambles up to sit, legs tucked beneath her, and positions herself about two inches from Amber\u2019s nose. \u201cDraw the mustache, get the spoon.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cHm. I seem to remember a very different course of events involving the spoon than you do. As in, I took yours and cornered you.\u201d Amber moves a centimeter closer to Andi, lets herself breathe. She can do this. She can keep up.</p><p>\t\u201cAs in, you have the home field advantage right now. If we were at <i>my</i> apartment, I could best you in wooden spoon dueling any day.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to take you up on that offer,\u201d Amber says.</p><p>\t\u201cI guess you will. Although,\u201d she continues, \u201cI seriously doubt that all six of us could fit in my room to sleepover. Or even a huge pillow fort. So it would have to be just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWould your parents even let you have boys over to sleepover?\u201d Amber asks. She doesn\u2019t know why she says it. It sounds useless in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201c Andi says, then cuts off. She relaxes back against the couch, and it occurs to Amber that they never set a timer for Jonah and Buffy. But she doesn\u2019t want to remind Andi of that, because she\u2019s having too much fun now: exchanging words, laughing, being as close as possible without truly touching.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhich is why it\u2019s so surprising when Andi, out of nowhere, muffles a sob.</p><p>\tShe\u2019s still leaning back against the couch, chin pointed upward and throat exposed to the ceiling. Amber can see the beginning of tears forming in her eyes. <i>Fuck.</i> Had Amber made her cry?<br/>\n\t\u201cAndi?\u201d</p><p>\tShe shakes her head and turns away, wiping the tear from her eye.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d Amber repeats, and reaches out a hand for her friend. Her <i>friend</i>, who needs her help right now, not hopeless pining.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi turns around and grips Amber\u2019s hand in her own, breathing fast. It\u2019s all so sudden. Amber wants to reach out and tuck back the strand of dark hair that has fallen in front of Andi\u2019s eyes. But she doesn\u2019t. Instead, she says: \u201cIs this\u2014is this about Buffy and Jonah and TJ and all of us?\u201d</p><p>\tOffering a sad laugh, Andi shakes her head. \u201cNo, not at all. You guys are all making up finally\u2014it\u2019s amazing. I want it to be forever.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know about <i>forever\u2014</i>\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cAmber, wait,\u201d Andi interrupts. \u201cI wanted to apologize to you. For\u2014\u201c\t</p><p>\t\u201cFor what? Middle school things? I\u2019m the one who should be apologizing; I\u2019m sorry\u2014I am\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d Andi says, and the word is full of tears. \u201cI want to apologize for\u2014for\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAndi cuts herself off, not once, but twice. She shakes her head, rubs her eyes, squeezes Amber\u2019s hand which is miraculously still holding Andi\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d Amber says, so soft that the word could be a feather.</p><p>\t\u201cI have something. Something that I\u2019ve wanted to tell you, for so, <i>so </i>long. And it sits on the tip of my tongue every time I have a conversation, especially with you, but I bury it inside, and I just can\u2019t live with myself anymore because I need to tell you so <i>bad</i>, Amber. I need to. And I couldn\u2019t sit here and laugh and talk anymore because I need to say it like I need air to breathe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe room, for once, is silent.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it,\u201d Andi says, so quiet Amber almost doesn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\tAmber waits.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tSeconds tick off: one, two, three. The same measure as Amber\u2019s heartbeats.</p><p>\t\u201cAmber,\u201d Andi whispers. \u201cI\u2019m bisexual.\u201d</p><p>\tAnd now she\u2019s crying. And now they\u2019re both crying. And now Amber can\u2019t see anything, can\u2019t think anything except this: <i>i love her i love her i love her i love her she\u2019s crying she\u2019s crying.</i></p><p>\tAnd now Amber takes Andi\u2019s other hand, and says: \u201cAndi. Andi. Andi, you are the most amazing, bravest person I know. Thank you for telling\u2014<i>thank you</i>, Andi\u2014I love you\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAmber hugs her, and Andi stays limp for one moment, in shock, before she hugs back, and their tears mix, and she rest her exhausted eyelids on Amber\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to say,\u201d Andi says, quietly. \u201cI\u2019m so <i>tired </i>of pretending to be someone I\u2019m not, only because I haven\u2019t said two words out loud. It feels like lying.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Amber says back, immediately, because she knows <i>exactly</i> how Andi feels, what it means to have a piece of her that she has to show the world, or else she\u2019s living a lie.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Andi echoes, and Amber wants so badly right now to tell her that she\u2019s not alone. She needs to. A glance around the room tells her that the other four are still in their respective closets (fuck, that\u2019s symbolic), and that Buffy\u2019s water bottle rests, forgotten, on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCome on,\u201d Amber whispers, keeping her right hand firmly in Andi\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014um\u2014let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d It\u2019s the only way she\u2019ll be able to get it out, if the two of them are alone. And she wants to. She wants to so bad, to reciprocate it and be able to exhale. Andi has finally given her the bravery to do it. (And why wouldn\u2019t it be Andi, the first girl Amber ever truly fell for, and the strongest person Amber knows, who gave her enough strength to say the words herself?)</p><p>\tAnd so they scramble up the stairs, tears still falling and hands permanently entangled. Amber\u2019s room is dimly lit, with snow on the windowpanes. She flips on the lamp and falls onto the bed, holding her breath. She wants to let it out so bad.</p><p>\tAndi tumbles down next to her, eyes unseeing, probably still processing what she\u2019s said out loud.</p><p>\t\u201cAndi,\u201d Amber says quietly, just like she said moments earlier. Andi turns to face her.</p><p>\t<i>Just say the words. Just say them. Just do it.</i></p><p>\tA balancing, a gift, a secret. Amber wants Andi to understand she\u2019s not alone, she never will be, she\u2019s so love and loved and <i>loved.</i></p><p>\tAgain: \u201cAndi.\u201d</p><p>\tNeither of them are looking anywhere in particular now. Amber thinks: <i>she\u2019s so brave. </i>Amber thinks: <i>it\u2019s time to stop being miserable. And to start being brave.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>Then Amber stops thinking, and she speaks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m also\u2014I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m bi\u2014I like girls, oh my god I can\u2019t believe I just said that. I like girls. So I\u2019m gay, or something. I don\u2019t know if I like boys, I don\u2019t really know, I might\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAndi is crashing into her before the rambling sentence can end. The second embrace is just like the first one, only better, because they\u2019ve both said it. They\u2019ve both said it.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>They\u2019ve </i>both <i>said it.</i></p><p>\tAndi is bisexual. Her crush is bisexual!\u2014Amber thinks, while crying into Andi\u2019s shoulder, with reckless happiness. It\u2019s not impossible\u2014it\u2019s not.</p><p>\tAnd then the tears keep coming.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s almost like that first night they held hands, because their fingers are still locked tightly together. But this time, they both fall back onto the bed, and they breathe, they breathe, they breathe. No more withholding breath like it\u2019s a tangible thing\u2014<i>well,</i> Amber thinks, <i>not until the worry about whether or not she likes me settles in, and the coming out to other people, and the distress about when and who and where. </i>But they made it. They both did.</p><p>\tAmber uses her palm to wipe away Andi\u2019s tears, and Andi does the same. And they lay back against Amber\u2019s comforter, all the words used up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHere they are: alive and ecstatic and apprehensive but so very free.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tWhen Buffy spins the bottle, it twirls back around, once, twice, then lands where it should, at a 180 degree angle right toward the boy next to her, because how could it not?</p><p>\tAndi gives her an approving smile and Buffy imagines and hopes Cyrus would give her a twin blessing. And so the two of them\u2014Buffy and Jonah, Jonah and Buffy\u2014stumble off to the closet, their hearts skipping beats in sync.</p><p>\tBuffy already has her hand on the doorknob to the first closet she sees before Jonah lets out a little gasp and grabs her wrist. \u201cNot that one,\u201d he whispers, nodding to the door. Buffy frowns, then remembers.</p><p>\t\u201cI almost just walked in on TJ Kippen and my best friend,\u201d Buffy snorts, pulling back her arm.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot good,\u201d Jonah says softly. \u201cWant to find another closet?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI suppose,\u201d Buffy says, twirling in a circle. Maybe it\u2019s the night, maybe it\u2019s the darkness of the Kippen basement hallways. But Buffy slides her wrist out from Jonah\u2019s hand and instead places her palm in his. Two hands, flat against each other, cupped together, and she drags him to the closet at the end of the hallway, which is, incidentally, about two feet wide and filled with books.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan we fit?\u201d Jonah whispers.</p><p>\t\u201cWe can make it work.\u201d Buffy pulls him into the closet, and his fingers flicker against the back of her hand. Once he pulls the door shut, and Buffy manages to click on the light switch next to the wall, she can see the dust cascading over every surface. Jonah coughs: once, twice, then grins sheepishly at her in the pale light.</p><p>\t\u201cAllergic to dust?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\t\u201cAllergic to dust.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI think I\u2019m allergic to sleep,\u201d Buffy says, leaning on the shelves on the wall. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten more than six hours in the past three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThis <i>is </i>a sleepover, so, were you planning to sleep tonight?\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy laughs sharply, tugging on Jonah\u2019s hand. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re worse than TJ,\u201d Jonah says, squinting.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to TJ,\u201d Buffy fires back, almost dropping his hand. Jonah laughs, in that Jonah Beck way: his eyes crinkle and his dimples deepen and he smiles with his teeth. Buffy, who has only ever been able to find a small group of individuals <i>attractive</i> in her entire life, thinks this needs to be added to the list. Thinks Jonah needs to be added to the list.\u00a0</p><p>\t16-year old Jonah Beck looks like the 13-year old Jonah Beck who first tossed her a frisbee, and he doesn\u2019t. The dimples and eyes are the same; the frame and height are not. Finally, in the end of eighth grade, Jonah shot up and reached her height so she could no longer tease him about being unable to touch the rim of a basketball hoop,or catch frisbees that were thrown too high. Now he still has the shadow of middle school heartthrob Jonah, but he has the essence of the Jonah who had his heart broken by Kira Summers freshman year. Buffy thinks about how she\u2019s known him all this time: skateboards and frisbees and attempted posters for Kira and all of it. She didn\u2019t really start to like him until this calendar year, not until after she and Marty ended up in pieces, and Kira and Jonah were done for good. After that it was movies at Jonah\u2019s house, it was skating down main street and stopping at Karl\u2019s to watch basketball on tv. It was Jonah and Buffy, unattached.</p><p>\t\u201cHey Buffy,\u201d Jonah says. \u201cLook what book\u2019s behind you.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy spins around, still gripping Jonah\u2019s hand, and scans the shelves. Her eyes land immediately on the one he wants her to pick out: <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Between their joint performance in English class of the balcony scene, and Andi\u2019s earlier remark, it feels like a vital piece of their relationship.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRemember when I fell?\u201d Buffy says, then starts to laugh. She had been attempting to stand on top of a desk and emulate Juliet\u2019s stance, but the legs had wobbled too much underneath her and she had tumbled directly on top of Jonah.</p><p>\t\u201cHow could I forget? I was only permanently scarred by your nails scratching me.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cIt was just payback for that one time you skated into me.\u201d</p><p>\tJonah laughs, shrugging, then pulls her back from the shelf so they\u2019re facing. And Buffy doesn\u2019t want to wait anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJonah, do you have a crush?\u201d</p><p>\tA beat.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUm. Yes.\u201d A second pause, then: \u201cSomeone at the sleepover.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy inhales, then curses herself for it, because she\u2019s showing her hand. She wants so badly for Jonah to say it\u2019s her, but she\u2019s already running through all of the other people it could be: Andi, Amber\u2014he denied it before, but still. Maybe it\u2019s TJ or Cyrus. Buffy doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0</p><p>\tTheir hands are still entangled tightly together, but neither of them seems to realize it. Instead, Buffy scoots a tiny bit closer to Jonah, and asks:\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with that, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAmber?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah laughs. \u201cDidn\u2019t I already explain this?\u201d</p><p>\t<i>Then who?</i> Buffy doesn\u2019t dare to hope.</p><p>\t\u201cIs it\u2026 TJ? Cyrus?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah shakes his head to both names, and Buffy notices the way his lips inflect at the mention of boys\u2019 names: not like he\u2019s surprised, like he\u2019s resigned. Another story for another time.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tightens his hold on her hand, and twists the hairband on her wrist. Buffy\u2019s waiting, waiting, waiting, just like she has for years, through Andi and Libby and Kira. She wasn\u2019t waiting for Jonah, at first, but she was waiting for this moment.</p><p>\t\u201cJonah,\u201d she says carefully. He flicks up his green-blue eyes at her, captured under thin eyelashes. He\u2019s so <i>nice</i> to look at, so considerate and talented and stupid, sometimes. \u201cIs it\u2014is it\u2014me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe half closes her eyes, preparing to wince. But that\u2019s only a reflex, because she\u2019s Buffy Driscoll. Buffy <i>Driscoll</i>, and she knows they\u2019re meant to be here, in the closet, in the dying light. She knows what the answer is, in a very Han-Solo-type way.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>\tPause.</p><p>\t\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy laughs, and it\u2019s in the confession that she sees Jonah\u2019s vulnerability. So she squeezes his hand, and says this:</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that\u2019s good. Considering I like you too.\u201d His eyes go wide.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014really?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally, Jonah Beck. I really do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah stares in amazement, and Buffy stares right back, smiling, because finally, finally, finally.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey\u2019re still holding hands a couple minutes later when Buffy yawns, closing her eyes. \u201cYou hungry? Up for an almost midnight snack?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAlways,\u201d Jonah Beck says, and pulls her out the door, swinging hands and laughing in the dark.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tCyrus thinks he understands now what it means to be glowing. He and TJ are still sitting in the closet, talking about who knows what. He keeps looking at TJ\u2019s smile, and thinking: he\u2019s part of the reason for that smile. And then Cyrus smiles, and TJ laughs, and they both glow.\u00a0</p><p>\tEventually, TJ tilts his head to the side and asks, \u201cWanna get some food? PB and J didn\u2019t exactly cut it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMuffins?\u201d Cyrus says hopefully.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChocolate chocolate chip!\u201d TJ shouts, then laughs. Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you think they make lemon-flavored muffins?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ drops Cyrus\u2019s hand and gapes at him. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not! They would be good!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLemons are sour!\u201d TJ insists.\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus can\u2019t resist it. \u201cLike you?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ just shakes his head. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m sweet\u2014wait no, <i>you\u2019re</i> sweet.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s sappy.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cSo are you!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMuffins it is!\u201d Cyrus declares, and grabs TJ\u2019s hand. They scramble into the hallway, then TJ, grinning wickedly, presses his back to the wall.</p><p>\t\u201cGot to be stealthy,\u201d he whispers, and shuffles quietly to where the wall ends, dragging Cyrus with him.</p><p>\t\u201cWait\u2014what about everyone else?\u201d Cyrus says nodding towards the corner. TJ puts his ear to the wall, biting his lip as he listens. Then he shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThere\u2019s no one there.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cHuh. Weird.\u201d Cyrus shrugs and follows TJ into the living room, where, sure enough: no one is there. The strings of light twinkle, alone, in the empty room. A few cookies sit forgotten on a tray thrown to the side, and the couch\u2019s pillows are scattered across the ground.</p><p>\t\u201cWhere do you think they went?\u201d TJ asks.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know. We might have just ended the spin the bottle game, considering we broke the rules.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cDid we?\u201d TJ asks, eyebrows raised. \u201cOr did we just make it more interesting?\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cWe were in that closet for more than seven minutes,\u201d Cyrus says, \u201cbut I see your point.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cPersonally, my money is on Jonah and your girl ending up together,\u201d TJ says. \u201cJust an inkling.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBuffy?\u201d Cyrus asks, already laughing.</p><p>\t\u201cNo\u2014Andi. Of course Buffy. Did you see their flirting earlier?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYup. I\u2019ve got eyes. I believe it. Now onto the muffins!\u201d Cyrus pulls TJ into the little basement kitchen, only to see:<br/>\n\tJonah looking guiltily over at them, with his free hand dipping a cracker into a peanut butter jar, and his other hand clutching Buffy\u2019s. Buffy, on the other hand, raises her eyebrows at the two of them, a challenge, and Cyrus can see the cookie crumbs on her lips.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFuck,\u201d TJ says, but he\u2019s grinning.\u00a0</p><p>\tThen he whispers, \u201cI told you so,\u201d to Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhile Jonah slowly takes the cracker out of the jar and puts it into his mouth, it occurs to Cyrus that he and TJ are also holding hands.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d Buffy says, like it\u2019s in a dream. She looks down at TJ and Cyrus\u2019s hands, eyes dancing with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d Cyrus says back.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe lost Andi and Amber,\u201d Jonah says, nodding, and exchanges a look with Buffy. Cyrus bites his lip, grinning, and thinking: maybe, all his friends get to be happy tonight. TJ, though, looks lost. Cyrus figures he\u2019ll get it soon.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was the rest of spin the bottle?\u201d Cyrus asks.</p><p>\tBuffy chokes on the cup of water she\u2019s drinking. \u201cIt was\u2026 interesting.\u201d Jonah gives her a little shove, and Cyrus\u2019s eyes go to their intertwined hands.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d TJ says, \u201cthat\u2019s all great. But we need muffins.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBe my guest,\u201d Jonah says, gesturing to the fridge. TJ squints at him.</p><p>\t\u201cThis is my house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd I\u2019m eternally grateful for\u2014ah\u2014\u201c Buffy shoves Jonah, and he looks back over at TJ. \u201cSorry. The muffins are in the fridge. We haven\u2019t touched them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ just tilts his head to the side in that TJ way and reaches past them to take the muffins from the fridge. Buffy bumps Cyrus, who has been pulled along, and mouths a scream of happiness. It comes across like a keyboard smash, and Cyrus smiles back to convey the same emotion for her. They\u2019ve both finally made reality what they\u2019ve wanted for so long.</p><p>\tOnce TJ grabs the muffins, he glances one more time over at Jonah. Cyrus considers two pieces of information in his head: TJ and Jonah have been fighting for years. Cyrus used to be head over heels for Jonah.</p><p>\tThe second feeling is long gone, though, and, with these two boys in front of him, Cyrus hopes the first is beginning to dissolve as well. Jonah is still important to him, and he doesn\u2019t want TJ and Jonah\u2019s fighting to ever cause problems. Now, in the way Jonah looks at TJ, like he\u2019s full of regret, Cyrus thinks the schism might be almost healed. He knows, though, that it\u2019s not his battle to fight. It\u2019s theirs.</p><p>\t\u201cHave fun!\u201d TJ says brightly, and Cyrus waves behind his shoulder as the two of them run up the stairs. Buffy waves back, smiling kindly, and Jonah just looks on.\u00a0</p><p>\tOnce they\u2019re up the basement stairs and running toward the main staircase, the adrenaline kicks in. Cyrus starts laughing, and then so does TJ, and they somehow make it to TJ\u2019s room before they collapse. TJ falls back on his bed, and Cyrus sprawls on the floor, next to the muffins.</p><p>\t\u201cNo lemon,\u201d Cyrus says, as he looks through the flavors.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChocolate?\u201d TJ asks, rolling over onto his stomach, and looking down at the plastic container.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThe very same flavor from the first day we met,\u201d Cyrus affirms, and tosses the wrapped chocolate muffin up to TJ. Somehow, TJ\u2019s athletic ability makes up for Cyrus\u2019s horrible throw, and he catches it.</p><p>\t\u201cRemember that?\u201d TJ says, unwrapping the muffin and already starting to split it.</p><p>\t\u201cI do,\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTastes good,\u201d TJ announces, with a mouth full of chocolate.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot as good as lemon!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cStop it with the lemon,\u201d TJ protests, reaching for a pillow to toss down at him.</p><p>\t\u201cThe Kippen household pillows are really being abused today.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ shrugs, and hands him the other half of the muffin. \u201cMy parents won\u2019t mind. As long as Amber and I clean up.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLeave the lights and decorations up, though. They\u2019re pretty,\u201d Cyrus says.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah I think I will. To preserve the memory, you know?\u201d TJ says. He jumps off the bed, shuffles around in his closet, and pulls out two sleeping bags. His eyebrows raise, like a question.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTired already, TJ-no-middle-name-Kippen?\u201d Cyrus says, dubious.</p><p>\t\u201cThe J is my middle name, and this is a <i>sleep</i>over. Sleep.\u201d TJ lays out the sleeping bags beside each other, lays back on one of them, and pats the other. Cyrus slips down beside him and scoots closer, sighing. He remembers, then, something he wants to ask about.\u00a0</p><p>\tTurning on his side to face him, he meets TJ\u2019s eyes. \u201cHey TJ, when you said you had your first kiss already, um\u2014\u201c<br/>\n\tTJ interrupts him, sensing the awkwardness. \u201cYeah. It was with Reed last year.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting, but it wasn\u2019t this. He feels his eyebrows go to his forehead. \u201cMiddle school watermelon Reed?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah. Um. It was at a party, and I wasn\u2019t exactly in the best state of mind. It was once.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus nods, processing. \u201cWow. Interesting first kiss story.\u201d<br/>\n\t\u201cYeah, well. This is the first one that mattered.\u201d TJ smiles, and a piece of blond hair tracks down in front of his eyes. Cyrus can\u2019t even think anymore, because <i>TJ Kippen</i> just said that about their kiss and he\u2019s right here and he\u2019s smiling and\u2014</p><p>\t<i>Yeah, </i>Cyrus thinks,<i> the thing about Reed doesn\u2019t matter at all.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>They curl up in the sleeping bags, trying to be warm from TJ\u2019s fan and the waves of cold coming from the window. And they talk and talk and talk. Cyrus thinks: <i>perfect perfect perfect </i>until his mind overloads and is, for once, quiet.</p><p>\tQuiet until, strangely like a horror movie, someone bangs on the door.</p><p>\tTJ sits up, rubbing his eyes, and frowns over at Cyrus.</p><p>\t\u201cGet up, lovebirds!\u201d It\u2019s Andi\u2019s voice. Then Amber knocks down the door, possibly with a kick, and runs over to them.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus says, like he just woke up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNope! We\u2019re sleeping downstairs. Bring the sleeping bags,\u201d Amber announces, reaching out a hand for TJ. He takes it and reluctantly stands up, looking between Andi and his sister.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re glowing. What\u2019s going on?\u201d <i>Glowing.</i> Cyrus hopes, for Andi\u2019s sake, it means what he thinks it means.</p><p>\t\u201cI never kiss and tell,\u201d Amber says, with narrowed eyes and a tiny grin. Andi doubles over coughing, stands up, and shoves Amber to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d TJ gapes at the two of them. Cyrus only stands up, shrugs, and gives TJ a look that says: <i>you\u2019ll figure it out someday.\u00a0</i></p><p>\t\u201cThey grow up so fast,\u201d Andi says, smiling at Cyrus and TJ. When Cyrus frowns, Andi shrugs. \u201cWe did say we were your mothers earlier.\u201d Laughing, Cyrus gathers up the sleeping bags and throws one of them into TJ\u2019s arms.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s go, people!\u201d Amber shouts, laughing, and the four of them race and tumble down the stairs toward the basement. Andi nearly trips on the fourth step down, but TJ catches her, then pushes her back to her feet with a flourish. Cyrus tosses his sleeping back to the ground below and Amber jumps on top of it, sticks the landing, tosses her hair, and looks back up at them.</p><p>\t\u201cJonah! Buffy!\u201d Andi shouts. In a split second, the pair appears around the corner, looking only slightly guilty.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cGrab some pillows,\u201d Amber directs Buffy. \u201cTJ, run up to mom\u2019s room and pull down some blankets and comforters. Jonah, you go too,\u201d she orders, a mirror of earlier.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi, Amber, and Cyrus go about clearing the space around the couch, and Amber drags the coffee table off to the side. Once the other four return, chaos fills the room, as sleeping bags and pillows are laid on the ground, and other pillow walls are thrown up:<br/>\n\t\u201cUse the ottoman\u2014\u201c<br/>\n\t\u201cNo, not that one, it\u2019s too comfortable to be a ceiling\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cOne, two, three\u2026 six pillows, okay good\u2014\u201c<br/>\n\t\u201cTJ! Stop flirting with Cyrus!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh! Throw some fairy lights over the top. And turn off the rest in the room.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat last comment is Amber, and as her vision takes shape, she holds onto Andi. The pillow fort is decidedly big enough for six people, and though it may collapse sometime during the night, no one seems to care.</p><p>\t\u201cWe do make a good team,\u201d Cyrus decides, looking over their creation. \u201cAll six of us.\u201d</p><p>\tAcross the room, Andi thinks about how three years ago, this sleepover would have been a fever dream. She clutches to the memory of an hour ago, when she and Amber whispered words they each never though they could say aloud to each other. She thinks about every single complex relationship in this room: couples and crushes and ex-crushes and best friends and tentative rivals and mending friendships and twins. She thinks about how they all made it here, today.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey all collapse into the fort together, on knees and elbows and backs. Jonah clicks on the last string of lights, giving them dim brightness to see by.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTruth or dare?\u201d Amber whispers, and someone throws a pillow at her.</p><p>\t\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Cyrus says quietly, cuddled up somewhere in the middle of TJ and Buffy. He thanks silently in his mind\u2014of all people\u2014Amber, for organizing this, so they can all breathe and share and confess in the same space together. A chorus of goodnights echoes back to him: his friends. His <i>friends</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\tOutside, the snow hasn\u2019t stopped, and it piles down across streets and sidewalks and front yards. While the Kippen house\u2014eventually\u2014sleeps, lights twinkle in the sky, and the night goes on.\u00a0</p><p><b>END PART 2</b></p>",

But maybe she wasn&rsquo;t, because Kira and Buffy still kept their tentative, basketball-centric, passive-aggressive friendship around.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tMaybe it didn&rsquo;t matter.

Her heart is beating too fast.</p><p>\tJonah, who looks only slightly ruffled, leans in, and, quick as a feather or a snowflake, dusts her cheek with a kiss.

Then, because she\u2019s tired of being ashamed, she turns to meet Jonah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cNext time, warn me before you lean in, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Next time</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\tBuffy doesn\u2019t know why she says it, except she definitely knows why she says it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhatever you say, Slayer,\u201d Jonah says, a beat too late, and nudges her shoulder.</p><p>\tIt feels like a moment. It feels like something.</p><p>\tWhile Amber pushes the bottle over toward her, Buffy replays several things in her head all at once:<br><i>One:</i> the day she met Jonah Beck. It was before Andi and the Good Hair Crew all latched onto him. It was before frisbee lessons with Bex and bracelets and all of that. Buffy had been walking home from Jefferson, crossing the fields where the Space Otters were practicing. A younger version of the Jonah next to her now had thrown a frisbee at her feet, eyebrows enticing. Sharp and suspicious and so very Buffy-like, she had picked it up and turned it over in her hands. Jonah finally reached out to take it, and she pulled it back, then threw it over his head to the girl behind him, who caught it squarely in her hands. \u201cJonah,\u201d he said, then, and she nodded. It wasn\u2019t until Andi introduced them later, and their paths crossed truly, that she lent him back her name. And it wasn\u2019t until months later, when the trust was real between them, that she gave her name to him, to have and share and keep as friends.</p><p>\t<i>Two: </i>the day Marty almost kissed her. It was like clockwork at that point: Buffy flopped down on the futon in Marty\u2019s room, unlaced her running shoes, and started on her physics homework. Marty spun around in his chair, tapping a pen against his chin, and attempted math homework while actually looking up runners on <i>milesplit.com</i>. It had been a Tuesday, that much she remembered. She asked Marty to come help her with something, and he trailed over, with tired eyes. They were sitting next to her, and Buffy felt something like a warm energy swelling inside her. She had <i>liked </i>Marty: ferociously, confidently, after their middle school falling out, for almost all of ninth grade. She couldn\u2019t deny it, any more than she could deny the way her heartbeat skipped when Jonah\u2019s kissed her cheek. But back then\u2014she wasn\u2019t ready, even then, to kiss anyone. It was hard to know if she ever would be\u2014sure, kisses on cheek and holding hands and arms around each other were all wonderful. But a kiss, on the lips? When Marty leaned in, Buffy\u2019s heart skipped, but not in a good way. She felt something essential break between them, just as she had two years earlier when Marty left her on the bridge. And it couldn\u2019t be the same again, and it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\t<i>Three</i>: the feeling in her stomach moments ago when Jonah pecked her on the cheek. Bumped her arm. Carried her on his shoulders so she could throw glittery pieces of paper at the ceiling. Days ago, ate baby taters in the booth across from her. She doesn\u2019t need to explain it any more; it\u2019s there.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s there, and he bumped her shoulder.</p><p>\tBuffy spins the bottle, and, because the world is just <i>like that</i>, it lands on the person sitting nearly directly across from her: TJ Kippen.</p><p>\t\u201cNope.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s the rules of the game,\u201d Andi says, holding back a laugh.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to kiss TJ Kippen,\u201d Buffy announces, standing up in her seat, \u201cthen you\u2019ve got\u2014ah\u2014\u201c<br>\n\tBuffy stops when TJ himself gets up, runs over, jumps on the couch, and pecks her on the cheek, all in about two seconds, looking annoyingly pleased with himself. TJ shakes his head once he does it, and Buffy gags, fake retching over the side of the couch. She doesn\u2019t look down at Jonah\u2019s face\u2014she\u2019s not sure she wants to see it.</p><p>\t\u201cGross!\u201d she yells at TJ\u2019s retreating figure, back over to Cyrus, who gives him a tentative high five.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot as gross as you!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re the one who <i>kissed </i>me!\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cWell were you going to do it?\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSettle down,\u201d Amber says, grinning. She glances at Andi; so much of their conversation seems to be in exchanges like that, small looks and knowing eyes. Buffy notices; how could she not?</p><p>\t\u201cNope. I need to go wash my mouth out,\u201d Buffy insists, hopping off the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe didn\u2019t even\u2014\u201c TJ protests. Buffy throws him a look, and runs off to the sink.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tThe tint of pinpoint lights and the sparkle of the snow outside the window are starting to hurt Cyrus\u2019s eyes. Otherwise in the dark, he\u2019s snuggled in the couch next to TJ, neither of them saying much. He keeps replaying the moment in his head, over and over: a pinky linked to his, two palms against each other, fingers interlocked. He keeps going back to how TJ was the one who curled his pinky over Cyrus\u2019s, how TJ was the one whose heartbeat he felt beating in sync with his in the contact of their wrists.</p><p>\tNow, they sit only inches apart, but their hands are separate.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe wishes he could know what TJ is thinking right now. He wishes he knew what <i>he </i>is thinking right now. Feelings, Cyrus has learned, are difficult.</p><p>\tActually, difficult is a poor way to put it. It\u2019s something more than difficult to know someone for three years, to know them <i>well</i> for two, and to have feelings for approximately two\u2014maybe more, maybe less. It\u2019s impossible, almost, to hang out and sleepover and talk and text for hours and <i>hold hands </i>with the boy he\u2019s so desperately enamored with, and to never say the words out loud. To Buffy and Andi, who spill back about their crushes (well, Buffy doesn\u2019t, but Cyrus figures she\u2019s figuring out how to manage the past with Marty and the future with Jonah), to them it\u2019s easy. But he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll ever say it out loud to TJ. Or if he ever wants to.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cEarth to Cyrus!\u201d Andi says, and he\u2019s back in the land of the living. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spun.\u201d<br>\n\tCyrus nods, sleepily, then glances down at the bottle. Pointing at him, accusingly. He glances up, counts off in his head what\u2019s occurred so far. Then\u2014</p><p>\t<i>Crap.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>TJ Kippen is looking over at him, uneasily. Everyone else is smiling at them, but Cyrus can\u2019t see them. He sees TJ, who doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do. It feels like he\u2019s nervous, which can\u2019t possibly be true\u2014he just kissed Buffy Driscoll with apparently no regard for his own life. But he\u2019s hesitating now.</p><p>\tEvery time something happens that might just means TJ could possibly like him, Cyrus feels his heart smiling inside.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cGo on,\u201d someone whispers across the circle. And so TJ does, and Cyrus\u2019s shoulders bristle and his mind goes blank and his stomach fills with violently present butterflies and TJ kisses him about two inches from his lips.</p><p>\tAnd Cyrus, who was trying to maintain calm, feels a supernova explode from that point. A small one, but a supernova nonetheless. It\u2019s the sting of the nerves and the warmth of his skin that reminds him (as if he didn\u2019t know already) that this is something he likes, that this boy in front of him is cute and attractive and magnetic.\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus is the one to pull away, because his erratic breathing is giving him away. (In the back of his head, he thinks: <i>and that was only on the cheek</i>.) But he puts that thought away, and falls back, breathless next to TJ, who looks a little sick and a lot happy.</p><p>\tHe misses the knowing look between Andi and Buffy, as if they\u2019re his wingwomen, and the smile Amber gives Jonah, because all of them ship this more than anything. Cyrus misses it, because he\u2019s thinking about TJ.</p><p>\tHe wants to say something, but what is there to say? So he doesn\u2019t, just silently takes the bottle in his hand and pauses only a moment before giving it a half-hearted spin.</p><p>\tBowie Quinn, Cyrus thinks, as the bottle slows to a stop, is right about the universe.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe cap is directed, irrefutably, toward the only one in the room Cyrus was afraid he would spin.</p><p>\t\u201cCloset!\u201d Buffy yells, and Cyrus thinks of the irony of it.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything\u2019s almost like a dream: the fairy lights, Andi\u2019s encouraging smile, TJ getting to his feet and stumbling over to the closet, followed by Cyrus. Everything\u2019s a haze, because this is not what Cyrus thought would happen tonight\u2014just the two of them, alone in a closet. A closet!<br>\n\tCyrus nearly doesn\u2019t make it the door. It\u2019s not an overstatement to say his vision might be a little blurry. Or maybe that\u2019s the dark.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen they both go in the closet and shut the door, it\u2019s still dark.</p><p>\tCyrus doesn\u2019t allow himself to think it too loudly, but he\u2019s <i>hoping.</i></p><p><i>\u2014</i></p><p><i>\t</i>TJ\u2019s mind short-circuited when he kissed Cyrus\u2019s cheek. TJ\u2019s mind short-circuited on his math final only days ago. TJ\u2019s mind stopped functioning for a moment when the Jefferson girls\u2019 basketball team won the championship last year, and Buffy Driscoll actually gave his broken-ACL-crutches self a <i>hug</i>.</p><p>\tHe\u2019s thanking his lucky stars that somehow, his mind is working right now.</p><p>\tCyrus\u2019s cheeks are still a little red, and TJ knows his are too, especially after the second spin. They walk to the closet, around the corner and out of sight of the rest of everyone.</p><p>\t\u201cI guess we\u2019re the lucky ones, huh?\u201d TJ says, holding the closet door open for Cyrus, who nods but doesn\u2019t say anything in return. Once the door swings shut, they\u2019re left in utter darkness. TJ swears softly and fumbles around the walls, searching for the switch. It\u2019s his house\u2014he really should know where the closet light is. But it\u2019s Cyrus who finds it, tugging on a string suspended from the ceiling and gazing over at TJ with dark eyes.</p><p>\tTJ wants, and he wants, and he wants. He wants with his eyes open and shut and when Cyrus looks over at him he almost kisses him then and there.</p><p>\tBut the two of them settle across from each other in the crowded closet, on opposite sides. TJ picks a spot on the wall just above Cyrus to rest his eyes.</p><p>\tSilence flickers for a moment before Cyrus shuffles and crosses the room to stand next to him. Cyrus, ever the brave one, always the strong one. TJ is so proud; there\u2019s not a drop of jealousy left in him. There used to be, back in middle school, when Cyrus had both Buffy and Andi and TJ had no one except maybe Reed. But it\u2019s all gone.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe light above them blinks, and in the space between darkness and light, TJ\u2019s hand ends up pressed against Cyrus\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t know how it happens, but it does. Like earlier, their hands intertwine, pressed together, and pull their sides against each other. TJ feels his breathing go shallow. When was the moment that Cyrus could first make him breathless? Maybe at the swings that second time. Maybe when he went to Cyrus\u2019s house and they sat, inches apart, watching made-for-tv movies last winter. Maybe every time they almost held hands, and the twice now that they truly have. And still are.</p><p>\tMinutes stack on top of each other and pile up, and TJ begins to realize he may be running out of time. For what? He can\u2019t exactly shape his intentions in his mind. But he knows.</p><p>\tAfter what seems like an eternity, Cyrus\u2019s hand twitches in his, and TJ decides he can\u2019t keep waiting, just like when he first pushed his hand into Cyrus\u2019s. He swings around, looking over at Cyrus, who looks back, almost afraid.</p><p>\tTheir faces are nearly touching, illuminated in the dusty closet light and opposites in a photographic negative.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus says, so delicately, like he could break the word with too much force. TJ\u2019s heart is flickering, fluttering, existing. \u201cDid you\u2014did you want to do seven minutes in heaven?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ sees the question break his face, sees Cyrus begin to ask himself why he said it. But TJ, again, sees the bravery splayed across his nervous mouth and endless eyes. His heartbeat hammers in his chest; it wants out.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe squeezes Cyrus\u2019s hand, and it\u2019s warm. \u201cOnly with you.\u201d</p><p>\tIt feels like the bravest thing he\u2019s ever said.</p><p>\tIt feels like the heartbeat in Cyrus\u2019s wrist is screaming against his.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt feels like something he was missing is almost, almost there.</p><p>\tHe sees Cyrus smile, and he sees the hand in his move upwards as the body attached to it shifts towards him. Instinctively, he closes his eyes.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s Cyrus who pulled him out of the dark, when his parents and his friends and the awfulness inside him were drowning him and he couldn\u2019t breathe. It\u2019s Cyrus who listened, who <i>listened</i> and was there for him always and ever. It\u2019s Cyrus who held him while he choked on tears in ninth grade, having discovered his knee no longer wanted to function as a knee for nine months. It\u2019s Cyrus who knows the stories of his parents and his grandparents and his sister and his loneliness. It\u2019s Cyrus who reached out and took that loneliness from him. It\u2019s Cyrus who matters. And it\u2019s Cyrus, then, who pushes the last few inches\u2014they\u2019re so<i> close</i>\u2014and breathes into reality what was meant to be all this time.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s Cyrus who grips TJ\u2019s hand and kisses him, sweet and simple, all at once.</p><p>\tIn less than a second, Cyrus pulls back, and he\u2019s still close enough that TJ can feel his measured breath and taste the anxiousness. His brows are drawn together, dark eyes worried, as if he\u2019s made a mistake.\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ wants that look gone from Cyrus\u2019s face.</p><p>\tHe lets go of Cyrus\u2019s hand and wraps his arms around him, embracing him tightly as Cyrus finally relaxes. He holds him, he holds him, he holds him, like the world is new and this is all he knows. He holds Cyrus like it\u2019s been three years in the making, because it has.</p><p>\tCyrus is crying, crying and breathing: exhaling, finally. And eventually TJ pulls back from the embrace, only because he has something else he needs to do. Cyrus rubs his eyes, still gazing up at TJ, waiting for one of them to say something.</p><p>\tTJ doesn\u2019t have anything to say, now. But he crosses the distance between them once again, because he needs to, because he wants to. And this time, when they kiss, no one pulls away.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s muffins and it\u2019s swings and it\u2019s somersaults and it\u2019s hidden smiles and it\u2019s long phone calls and it\u2019s happiness, happiness, happiness.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tAmber is still laughing, watching TJ and Cyrus follow each other, mesmerized, into the closet. But everyone else looks on in wonder and maybe jealousy, wishing for <i>something.</i> Amber wants <i>something</i> too, but she doesn\u2019t want to allow herself to think about it.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Andi asks finally. \u201cIt\u2019s no one\u2019s turn.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou can spin,\u201d Amber interrupts, running a hand through her hair. \u201cI\u2019ll just assume we won\u2019t get either of them out of there for a while.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShould we set a timer, though?\u201d Jonah asks, already reaching for his phone. Amber shrugs and so Jonah sets it anyway, the seconds ticking away.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi picks up the bottle, tosses it around in her hands a few times, much to Buffy\u2019s chagrin. Then she drops it on the table, spinning it quickly and delicately. Amber watches Andi\u2019s hands tip the bottle, almost like she\u2019s piecing together the parts of a puzzle or a craft. And she watches Andi\u2019s spin push the bottle around seven times until it ends up, somehow unsurprisingly, pointing at Amber.</p><p>\tAmber has come to expect this. She thinks of their moment in the kitchen, hours ago, and wonders if Andi will even remember it tomorrow. She thinks about how Andi kissed Jonah so easily. She lets her own insecurity wash over her, because it\u2019s almost easier than thinking the possibility she hopes for could be true.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPucker up,\u201d Andi says jokingly, and Amber considers how bold Andi has become in the past year. Part of Amber thinks it\u2019s her own fault (not that she minds the change).\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi leans over, grinning, and kisses Amber on the cheek. It lasts half a second longer than the rest of the kisses, but it\u2019s hard for Amber to think anything of it. Not when Andi does it so casually, and flourishes her movements after the fact, grinning. It\u2019s even harder for Amber to imagine that Andi could kiss someone she had romantic feelings for like it\u2019s nothing.</p><p>\tAnd Amber has seen this before: it\u2019s the air that gay girls breathe. Friendships so deep they might as well be romances, but to one half of the pairing, they could never be. Texting late into the night, sharing anything and everything, even holding hands. Amber doesn\u2019t want that to be what\u2019s between her and Andi; she really, desperately doesn\u2019t. But she thinks of the unspoken jokes between them, of text threads that extend into tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd she takes the bottle, not wanting to let herself keep thinking.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey Amber,\u201d Buffy says suddenly. \u201cRemember when Cyrus forced us to have a therapy session to reconcile?\u201d</p><p>\tAmber winces, because memories of that come with memories of things she and Andi have already put behind them: ferris wheels and marker hearts and hatred.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, I remember. We hated each other,\u201d she responds carefully. Beside her, Andi studies the couch, contemplating.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Buffy says, all too suddenly again. \u201cFor hating you for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\tIt\u2019s the strangest apology, out of place and in the wrong time. They\u2019ve made up dozens of times before, or they wouldn\u2019t be here, in the same house, about to have a sleepover.</p><p>\tAnd yet.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Amber says, softer than she\u2019s ever said most anything. \u201cI was awful, and I should\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>\tAndi is looking directly at Jonah, unable to take a side in this. So Amber keeps her gaze locked on Buffy\u2019s, who looks\u2014gentler. More open.</p><p>\t\u201cI just wanted to say it,\u201d Buffy says, \u201cso we can finally, finally move on.\u201d</p><p>\tAmber smiles, then. \u201cLook at us. Cyrus had to bring us in for relationship therapy and now we\u2019re all helping him and TJ\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cHang out,\u201d Jonah cuts in, with a grin. Amber imagines if her brother were here, the reconciliation might finally be complete: Buffy and TJ, TJ and Jonah, Jonah and Amber, Amber and Buffy. But TJ\u2019s not here, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s enough to know that Andi\u2019s best friend\u2014that <i>Buffy</i>\u2014forgives her. That she wants to move on.</p><p>\t\u201cTime to spin the bottle?\u201d Buffy asks, hopefully. Amber is struck, suddenly, with how the spiky outer shell of middle-school Buffy has softened into kindness and strength.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou got it.\u201d Amber drops the bottle in the middle and spins it. And spins it and spins it until:</p><p>\t\u201cI guess we really are throwing it back,\u201d Andi laughs, the first word she\u2019s spoken in a few minutes. The bottle declares her destiny, with no regrets: Jonah Beck.</p><p>\tJonah Beck: the only boy to ever catch Amber Kippen\u2019s eye. Jonah Beck: a question mark. Jonah Beck: certainly not who she wanted to be kissing tonight.</p><p>\tStill, Amber leans across Buffy to peck Jonah on the cheek. She wants it to be nothing, but she also wants it to be something final. Something Andi can see and know: the past is past. All of it.</p><p>\tAs Amber leans back, and Jonah makes no expression at all, Amber thinks about how things from so long ago still affect them today. She doesn\u2019t want eighth grade Amber, the one who was struggling so badly with her parents that she lashed out at everyone around her, to be the one they all remember. The one who comes to mind. And she\u2019s been trying to erase that version of herself for so long\u2014over two years.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s worn out and cliche, but Amber\u2019s so tired of being the mean girl. She wonders if apologizing to Buffy and kissing Jonah Beck is enough. She wonders if anything will ever be enough.</p><p>\t\u201cMy turn,\u201d Jonah says hurriedly, cutting the silence. He spins it again, and lands on\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014Buffy.\u00a0</p><p>\tAmber\u2019s suspected the both of them for long enough, and as they go off into the closet, Andi also wears a smug smile. And then it\u2019s just the two of them: Amber and Andi. Isn\u2019t it always?</p><p>\tMoments after Jonah and Buffy leave, the timer on Buffy\u2019s phone goes off, signifying the end of TJ and Cyrus\u2019s seven minutes. Andi gives Amber a look that asks: <i>are you going to go get them?</i> Amber gives her back a look that says: <i>no, are you crazy?</i> Andi deactivates the alarm in agreement. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow do you think they\u2019re doing?\u201d Amber asks out loud.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly? Thriving,\u201d Andi says. \u201cI hope Jonah and Buffy are too.\u201d There\u2019s something unspoken there: the last two left.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd us?\u201d Amber asks.</p><p>\t\u201cTired,\u201d Andi admits. \u201cDrained from finals. Full of peanut butter sandwiches and cinnamon cookies.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTired?\u201d Amber says, like it\u2019s a shock. \u201cIt\u2019s only about ten thirty, and you never sleep\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI never sleep,\u201d Andi agrees. \u201cBut suddenly I feel like I could sleep for days. Maybe it was the snow this morning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMayhaps someone made too many snow angels?\u201d Amber asks.</p><p>\t\u201cMayhaps <i>someone</i> threw about a hundred snowballs at me.\u201d</p><p>\tAmber reaches up and swats at one of the stray strings of light above their heads. \u201cHow long do you think the snow\u2019s going to last?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBex and I have decided two days at the most. Enough time to go to the alpine slide.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThe alpine slide?? In the snow?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJust a little tradition I have with my parents. Buffy, Cyrus, and I used to go in the fall but we haven\u2019t since\u2026 a certain disaster.\u201d</p><p>\tAndi leans back on Amber\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou know, spin the bottle doesn\u2019t make much sense if everyone ends up in the closet at once\u2014wait a minute, which closet did Jonah and Buffy go in? If TJ and Cyrus are in the other ones?\u201d</p><p>\tAmber shrugs. \u201cThe second dimension one. They\u2019re actually both in the same closet at once, but in different metaphysical spaces.\u201d</p><p>\tTurning around to look directly at Amber, inches away from her nose, Andi narrows her eyes. \u201cEither you\u2019re on drugs or you\u2019re a nerd.\u201d<br>\n\tAmber stretches back: anything to get away from Andi\u2019s very present bright eyes and tiny smile. \u201cTJ\u2019s the nerd, not me.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cDrugs it is, then.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou got me,\u201d Amber mumbles, fading off. And then, like a scene from a dream, Andi reaches up and twirls a strand of Amber\u2019s hair between her fingers, eyes half-lidded.</p><p>\t\u201cI <i>am</i> tired,\u201d Andi asserts. Amber keeps holding her breath.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you fall asleep on me, I\u2019ll draw a mustache on your face,\u201d Amber teases, and Andi stops twirling her hair, turns around and tilts her chin up so she\u2019s staring right at Amber.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you draw a mustache on my face, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Andi, for once, comes up short of words.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d Amber asks, smiling. If Andi can flirt like it\u2019s nothing, then so can she. She winks down at Andi. \u201cThrow snowballs at me?\u201d</p><p>\tAndi sighs and rolls her eyes, but she\u2019s grinning too. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll put snow in your sleeping bag. There.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll craft me to death?\u201d Amber continues, ignoring Andi\u2019s remark.</p><p>\t\u201cHey! You\u2019ve already seen my baking skills, which include wielding a large wooden spoon. Don\u2019t test me.\u201dAndi scrambles up to sit, legs tucked beneath her, and positions herself about two inches from Amber\u2019s nose. \u201cDraw the mustache, get the spoon.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cHm. I seem to remember a very different course of events involving the spoon than you do. As in, I took yours and cornered you.\u201d Amber moves a centimeter closer to Andi, lets herself breathe. She can do this. She can keep up.</p><p>\t\u201cAs in, you have the home field advantage right now. If we were at <i>my</i> apartment, I could best you in wooden spoon dueling any day.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to take you up on that offer,\u201d Amber says.</p><p>\t\u201cI guess you will. Although,\u201d she continues, \u201cI seriously doubt that all six of us could fit in my room to sleepover. Or even a huge pillow fort. So it would have to be just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWould your parents even let you have boys over to sleepover?\u201d Amber asks. She doesn\u2019t know why she says it. It sounds useless in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201c Andi says, then cuts off. She relaxes back against the couch, and it occurs to Amber that they never set a timer for Jonah and Buffy. But she doesn\u2019t want to remind Andi of that, because she\u2019s having too much fun now: exchanging words, laughing, being as close as possible without truly touching.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhich is why it\u2019s so surprising when Andi, out of nowhere, muffles a sob.</p><p>\tShe\u2019s still leaning back against the couch, chin pointed upward and throat exposed to the ceiling. Amber can see the beginning of tears forming in her eyes. <i>Fuck.</i> Had Amber made her cry?<br>\n\t\u201cAndi?\u201d</p><p>\tShe shakes her head and turns away, wiping the tear from her eye.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d Amber repeats, and reaches out a hand for her friend. Her <i>friend</i>, who needs her help right now, not hopeless pining.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi turns around and grips Amber\u2019s hand in her own, breathing fast. It\u2019s all so sudden. Amber wants to reach out and tuck back the strand of dark hair that has fallen in front of Andi\u2019s eyes. But she doesn\u2019t. Instead, she says: \u201cIs this\u2014is this about Buffy and Jonah and TJ and all of us?\u201d</p><p>\tOffering a sad laugh, Andi shakes her head. \u201cNo, not at all. You guys are all making up finally\u2014it\u2019s amazing. I want it to be forever.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know about <i>forever\u2014</i>\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cAmber, wait,\u201d Andi interrupts. \u201cI wanted to apologize to you. For\u2014\u201c\t</p><p>\t\u201cFor what? Middle school things? I\u2019m the one who should be apologizing; I\u2019m sorry\u2014I am\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d Andi says, and the word is full of tears. \u201cI want to apologize for\u2014for\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAndi cuts herself off, not once, but twice. She shakes her head, rubs her eyes, squeezes Amber\u2019s hand which is miraculously still holding Andi\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d Amber says, so soft that the word could be a feather.</p><p>\t\u201cI have something. Something that I\u2019ve wanted to tell you, for so, <i>so </i>long. And it sits on the tip of my tongue every time I have a conversation, especially with you, but I bury it inside, and I just can\u2019t live with myself anymore because I need to tell you so <i>bad</i>, Amber. I need to. And I couldn\u2019t sit here and laugh and talk anymore because I need to say it like I need air to breathe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe room, for once, is silent.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it,\u201d Andi says, so quiet Amber almost doesn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\tAmber waits.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tSeconds tick off: one, two, three. The same measure as Amber\u2019s heartbeats.</p><p>\t\u201cAmber,\u201d Andi whispers. \u201cI\u2019m bisexual.\u201d</p><p>\tAnd now she\u2019s crying. And now they\u2019re both crying. And now Amber can\u2019t see anything, can\u2019t think anything except this: <i>i love her i love her i love her i love her she\u2019s crying she\u2019s crying.</i></p><p>\tAnd now Amber takes Andi\u2019s other hand, and says: \u201cAndi. Andi. Andi, you are the most amazing, bravest person I know. Thank you for telling\u2014<i>thank you</i>, Andi\u2014I love you\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAmber hugs her, and Andi stays limp for one moment, in shock, before she hugs back, and their tears mix, and she rest her exhausted eyelids on Amber\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to say,\u201d Andi says, quietly. \u201cI\u2019m so <i>tired </i>of pretending to be someone I\u2019m not, only because I haven\u2019t said two words out loud. It feels like lying.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Amber says back, immediately, because she knows <i>exactly</i> how Andi feels, what it means to have a piece of her that she has to show the world, or else she\u2019s living a lie.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Andi echoes, and Amber wants so badly right now to tell her that she\u2019s not alone. She needs to. A glance around the room tells her that the other four are still in their respective closets (fuck, that\u2019s symbolic), and that Buffy\u2019s water bottle rests, forgotten, on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCome on,\u201d Amber whispers, keeping her right hand firmly in Andi\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014um\u2014let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d It\u2019s the only way she\u2019ll be able to get it out, if the two of them are alone. And she wants to. She wants to so bad, to reciprocate it and be able to exhale. Andi has finally given her the bravery to do it. (And why wouldn\u2019t it be Andi, the first girl Amber ever truly fell for, and the strongest person Amber knows, who gave her enough strength to say the words herself?)</p><p>\tAnd so they scramble up the stairs, tears still falling and hands permanently entangled. Amber\u2019s room is dimly lit, with snow on the windowpanes. She flips on the lamp and falls onto the bed, holding her breath. She wants to let it out so bad.</p><p>\tAndi tumbles down next to her, eyes unseeing, probably still processing what she\u2019s said out loud.</p><p>\t\u201cAndi,\u201d Amber says quietly, just like she said moments earlier. Andi turns to face her.</p><p>\t<i>Just say the words. Just say them. Just do it.</i></p><p>\tA balancing, a gift, a secret. Amber wants Andi to understand she\u2019s not alone, she never will be, she\u2019s so love and loved and <i>loved.</i></p><p>\tAgain: \u201cAndi.\u201d</p><p>\tNeither of them are looking anywhere in particular now. Amber thinks: <i>she\u2019s so brave. </i>Amber thinks: <i>it\u2019s time to stop being miserable. And to start being brave.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>Then Amber stops thinking, and she speaks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m also\u2014I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m bi\u2014I like girls, oh my god I can\u2019t believe I just said that. I like girls. So I\u2019m gay, or something. I don\u2019t know if I like boys, I don\u2019t really know, I might\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAndi is crashing into her before the rambling sentence can end. The second embrace is just like the first one, only better, because they\u2019ve both said it. They\u2019ve both said it.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>They\u2019ve </i>both <i>said it.</i></p><p>\tAndi is bisexual. Her crush is bisexual!\u2014Amber thinks, while crying into Andi\u2019s shoulder, with reckless happiness. It\u2019s not impossible\u2014it\u2019s not.</p><p>\tAnd then the tears keep coming.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s almost like that first night they held hands, because their fingers are still locked tightly together. But this time, they both fall back onto the bed, and they breathe, they breathe, they breathe. No more withholding breath like it\u2019s a tangible thing\u2014<i>well,</i> Amber thinks, <i>not until the worry about whether or not she likes me settles in, and the coming out to other people, and the distress about when and who and where. </i>But they made it. They both did.</p><p>\tAmber uses her palm to wipe away Andi\u2019s tears, and Andi does the same. And they lay back against Amber\u2019s comforter, all the words used up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHere they are: alive and ecstatic and apprehensive but so very free.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tWhen Buffy spins the bottle, it twirls back around, once, twice, then lands where it should, at a 180 degree angle right toward the boy next to her, because how could it not?</p><p>\tAndi gives her an approving smile and Buffy imagines and hopes Cyrus would give her a twin blessing. And so the two of them\u2014Buffy and Jonah, Jonah and Buffy\u2014stumble off to the closet, their hearts skipping beats in sync.</p><p>\tBuffy already has her hand on the doorknob to the first closet she sees before Jonah lets out a little gasp and grabs her wrist. \u201cNot that one,\u201d he whispers, nodding to the door. Buffy frowns, then remembers.</p><p>\t\u201cI almost just walked in on TJ Kippen and my best friend,\u201d Buffy snorts, pulling back her arm.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot good,\u201d Jonah says softly. \u201cWant to find another closet?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI suppose,\u201d Buffy says, twirling in a circle. Maybe it\u2019s the night, maybe it\u2019s the darkness of the Kippen basement hallways. But Buffy slides her wrist out from Jonah\u2019s hand and instead places her palm in his. Two hands, flat against each other, cupped together, and she drags him to the closet at the end of the hallway, which is, incidentally, about two feet wide and filled with books.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan we fit?\u201d Jonah whispers.</p><p>\t\u201cWe can make it work.\u201d Buffy pulls him into the closet, and his fingers flicker against the back of her hand. Once he pulls the door shut, and Buffy manages to click on the light switch next to the wall, she can see the dust cascading over every surface. Jonah coughs: once, twice, then grins sheepishly at her in the pale light.</p><p>\t\u201cAllergic to dust?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\t\u201cAllergic to dust.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI think I\u2019m allergic to sleep,\u201d Buffy says, leaning on the shelves on the wall. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten more than six hours in the past three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThis <i>is </i>a sleepover, so, were you planning to sleep tonight?\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy laughs sharply, tugging on Jonah\u2019s hand. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re worse than TJ,\u201d Jonah says, squinting.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to TJ,\u201d Buffy fires back, almost dropping his hand. Jonah laughs, in that Jonah Beck way: his eyes crinkle and his dimples deepen and he smiles with his teeth. Buffy, who has only ever been able to find a small group of individuals <i>attractive</i> in her entire life, thinks this needs to be added to the list. Thinks Jonah needs to be added to the list.\u00a0</p><p>\t16-year old Jonah Beck looks like the 13-year old Jonah Beck who first tossed her a frisbee, and he doesn\u2019t. The dimples and eyes are the same; the frame and height are not. Finally, in the end of eighth grade, Jonah shot up and reached her height so she could no longer tease him about being unable to touch the rim of a basketball hoop,or catch frisbees that were thrown too high. Now he still has the shadow of middle school heartthrob Jonah, but he has the essence of the Jonah who had his heart broken by Kira Summers freshman year. Buffy thinks about how she\u2019s known him all this time: skateboards and frisbees and attempted posters for Kira and all of it. She didn\u2019t really start to like him until this calendar year, not until after she and Marty ended up in pieces, and Kira and Jonah were done for good. After that it was movies at Jonah\u2019s house, it was skating down main street and stopping at Karl\u2019s to watch basketball on tv. It was Jonah and Buffy, unattached.</p><p>\t\u201cHey Buffy,\u201d Jonah says. \u201cLook what book\u2019s behind you.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy spins around, still gripping Jonah\u2019s hand, and scans the shelves. Her eyes land immediately on the one he wants her to pick out: <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Between their joint performance in English class of the balcony scene, and Andi\u2019s earlier remark, it feels like a vital piece of their relationship.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRemember when I fell?\u201d Buffy says, then starts to laugh. She had been attempting to stand on top of a desk and emulate Juliet\u2019s stance, but the legs had wobbled too much underneath her and she had tumbled directly on top of Jonah.</p><p>\t\u201cHow could I forget? I was only permanently scarred by your nails scratching me.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cIt was just payback for that one time you skated into me.\u201d</p><p>\tJonah laughs, shrugging, then pulls her back from the shelf so they\u2019re facing. And Buffy doesn\u2019t want to wait anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJonah, do you have a crush?\u201d</p><p>\tA beat.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUm. Yes.\u201d A second pause, then: \u201cSomeone at the sleepover.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy inhales, then curses herself for it, because she\u2019s showing her hand. She wants so badly for Jonah to say it\u2019s her, but she\u2019s already running through all of the other people it could be: Andi, Amber\u2014he denied it before, but still. Maybe it\u2019s TJ or Cyrus. Buffy doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0</p><p>\tTheir hands are still entangled tightly together, but neither of them seems to realize it. Instead, Buffy scoots a tiny bit closer to Jonah, and asks:\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with that, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAmber?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah laughs. \u201cDidn\u2019t I already explain this?\u201d</p><p>\t<i>Then who?</i> Buffy doesn\u2019t dare to hope.</p><p>\t\u201cIs it\u2026 TJ? Cyrus?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah shakes his head to both names, and Buffy notices the way his lips inflect at the mention of boys\u2019 names: not like he\u2019s surprised, like he\u2019s resigned. Another story for another time.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tightens his hold on her hand, and twists the hairband on her wrist. Buffy\u2019s waiting, waiting, waiting, just like she has for years, through Andi and Libby and Kira. She wasn\u2019t waiting for Jonah, at first, but she was waiting for this moment.</p><p>\t\u201cJonah,\u201d she says carefully. He flicks up his green-blue eyes at her, captured under thin eyelashes. He\u2019s so <i>nice</i> to look at, so considerate and talented and stupid, sometimes. \u201cIs it\u2014is it\u2014me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe half closes her eyes, preparing to wince. But that\u2019s only a reflex, because she\u2019s Buffy Driscoll. Buffy <i>Driscoll</i>, and she knows they\u2019re meant to be here, in the closet, in the dying light. She knows what the answer is, in a very Han-Solo-type way.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>\tPause.</p><p>\t\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy laughs, and it\u2019s in the confession that she sees Jonah\u2019s vulnerability. So she squeezes his hand, and says this:</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that\u2019s good. Considering I like you too.\u201d His eyes go wide.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014really?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally, Jonah Beck. I really do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah stares in amazement, and Buffy stares right back, smiling, because finally, finally, finally.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey\u2019re still holding hands a couple minutes later when Buffy yawns, closing her eyes. \u201cYou hungry? Up for an almost midnight snack?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAlways,\u201d Jonah Beck says, and pulls her out the door, swinging hands and laughing in the dark.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tCyrus thinks he understands now what it means to be glowing. He and TJ are still sitting in the closet, talking about who knows what. He keeps looking at TJ\u2019s smile, and thinking: he\u2019s part of the reason for that smile. And then Cyrus smiles, and TJ laughs, and they both glow.\u00a0</p><p>\tEventually, TJ tilts his head to the side and asks, \u201cWanna get some food? PB and J didn\u2019t exactly cut it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMuffins?\u201d Cyrus says hopefully.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChocolate chocolate chip!\u201d TJ shouts, then laughs. Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you think they make lemon-flavored muffins?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ drops Cyrus\u2019s hand and gapes at him. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not! They would be good!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLemons are sour!\u201d TJ insists.\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus can\u2019t resist it. \u201cLike you?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ just shakes his head. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m sweet\u2014wait no, <i>you\u2019re</i> sweet.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s sappy.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cSo are you!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMuffins it is!\u201d Cyrus declares, and grabs TJ\u2019s hand. They scramble into the hallway, then TJ, grinning wickedly, presses his back to the wall.</p><p>\t\u201cGot to be stealthy,\u201d he whispers, and shuffles quietly to where the wall ends, dragging Cyrus with him.</p><p>\t\u201cWait\u2014what about everyone else?\u201d Cyrus says nodding towards the corner. TJ puts his ear to the wall, biting his lip as he listens. Then he shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThere\u2019s no one there.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cHuh. Weird.\u201d Cyrus shrugs and follows TJ into the living room, where, sure enough: no one is there. The strings of light twinkle, alone, in the empty room. A few cookies sit forgotten on a tray thrown to the side, and the couch\u2019s pillows are scattered across the ground.</p><p>\t\u201cWhere do you think they went?\u201d TJ asks.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know. We might have just ended the spin the bottle game, considering we broke the rules.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cDid we?\u201d TJ asks, eyebrows raised. \u201cOr did we just make it more interesting?\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cWe were in that closet for more than seven minutes,\u201d Cyrus says, \u201cbut I see your point.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cPersonally, my money is on Jonah and your girl ending up together,\u201d TJ says. \u201cJust an inkling.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBuffy?\u201d Cyrus asks, already laughing.</p><p>\t\u201cNo\u2014Andi. Of course Buffy. Did you see their flirting earlier?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYup. I\u2019ve got eyes. I believe it. Now onto the muffins!\u201d Cyrus pulls TJ into the little basement kitchen, only to see:<br>\n\tJonah looking guiltily over at them, with his free hand dipping a cracker into a peanut butter jar, and his other hand clutching Buffy\u2019s. Buffy, on the other hand, raises her eyebrows at the two of them, a challenge, and Cyrus can see the cookie crumbs on her lips.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFuck,\u201d TJ says, but he\u2019s grinning.\u00a0</p><p>\tThen he whispers, \u201cI told you so,\u201d to Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhile Jonah slowly takes the cracker out of the jar and puts it into his mouth, it occurs to Cyrus that he and TJ are also holding hands.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d Buffy says, like it\u2019s in a dream. She looks down at TJ and Cyrus\u2019s hands, eyes dancing with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d Cyrus says back.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe lost Andi and Amber,\u201d Jonah says, nodding, and exchanges a look with Buffy. Cyrus bites his lip, grinning, and thinking: maybe, all his friends get to be happy tonight. TJ, though, looks lost. Cyrus figures he\u2019ll get it soon.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was the rest of spin the bottle?\u201d Cyrus asks.</p><p>\tBuffy chokes on the cup of water she\u2019s drinking. \u201cIt was\u2026 interesting.\u201d Jonah gives her a little shove, and Cyrus\u2019s eyes go to their intertwined hands.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d TJ says, \u201cthat\u2019s all great. But we need muffins.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBe my guest,\u201d Jonah says, gesturing to the fridge. TJ squints at him.</p><p>\t\u201cThis is my house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd I\u2019m eternally grateful for\u2014ah\u2014\u201c Buffy shoves Jonah, and he looks back over at TJ. \u201cSorry. The muffins are in the fridge. We haven\u2019t touched them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ just tilts his head to the side in that TJ way and reaches past them to take the muffins from the fridge. Buffy bumps Cyrus, who has been pulled along, and mouths a scream of happiness. It comes across like a keyboard smash, and Cyrus smiles back to convey the same emotion for her. They\u2019ve both finally made reality what they\u2019ve wanted for so long.</p><p>\tOnce TJ grabs the muffins, he glances one more time over at Jonah. Cyrus considers two pieces of information in his head: TJ and Jonah have been fighting for years. Cyrus used to be head over heels for Jonah.</p><p>\tThe second feeling is long gone, though, and, with these two boys in front of him, Cyrus hopes the first is beginning to dissolve as well. Jonah is still important to him, and he doesn\u2019t want TJ and Jonah\u2019s fighting to ever cause problems. Now, in the way Jonah looks at TJ, like he\u2019s full of regret, Cyrus thinks the schism might be almost healed. He knows, though, that it\u2019s not his battle to fight. It\u2019s theirs.</p><p>\t\u201cHave fun!\u201d TJ says brightly, and Cyrus waves behind his shoulder as the two of them run up the stairs. Buffy waves back, smiling kindly, and Jonah just looks on.\u00a0</p><p>\tOnce they\u2019re up the basement stairs and running toward the main staircase, the adrenaline kicks in. Cyrus starts laughing, and then so does TJ, and they somehow make it to TJ\u2019s room before they collapse. TJ falls back on his bed, and Cyrus sprawls on the floor, next to the muffins.</p><p>\t\u201cNo lemon,\u201d Cyrus says, as he looks through the flavors.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChocolate?\u201d TJ asks, rolling over onto his stomach, and looking down at the plastic container.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThe very same flavor from the first day we met,\u201d Cyrus affirms, and tosses the wrapped chocolate muffin up to TJ. Somehow, TJ\u2019s athletic ability makes up for Cyrus\u2019s horrible throw, and he catches it.</p><p>\t\u201cRemember that?\u201d TJ says, unwrapping the muffin and already starting to split it.</p><p>\t\u201cI do,\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTastes good,\u201d TJ announces, with a mouth full of chocolate.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot as good as lemon!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cStop it with the lemon,\u201d TJ protests, reaching for a pillow to toss down at him.</p><p>\t\u201cThe Kippen household pillows are really being abused today.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ shrugs, and hands him the other half of the muffin. \u201cMy parents won\u2019t mind. As long as Amber and I clean up.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLeave the lights and decorations up, though. They\u2019re pretty,\u201d Cyrus says.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah I think I will. To preserve the memory, you know?\u201d TJ says. He jumps off the bed, shuffles around in his closet, and pulls out two sleeping bags. His eyebrows raise, like a question.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTired already, TJ-no-middle-name-Kippen?\u201d Cyrus says, dubious.</p><p>\t\u201cThe J is my middle name, and this is a <i>sleep</i>over. Sleep.\u201d TJ lays out the sleeping bags beside each other, lays back on one of them, and pats the other. Cyrus slips down beside him and scoots closer, sighing. He remembers, then, something he wants to ask about.\u00a0</p><p>\tTurning on his side to face him, he meets TJ\u2019s eyes. \u201cHey TJ, when you said you had your first kiss already, um\u2014\u201c<br>\n\tTJ interrupts him, sensing the awkwardness. \u201cYeah. It was with Reed last year.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting, but it wasn\u2019t this. He feels his eyebrows go to his forehead. \u201cMiddle school watermelon Reed?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah. Um. It was at a party, and I wasn\u2019t exactly in the best state of mind. It was once.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus nods, processing. \u201cWow. Interesting first kiss story.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cYeah, well. This is the first one that mattered.\u201d TJ smiles, and a piece of blond hair tracks down in front of his eyes. Cyrus can\u2019t even think anymore, because <i>TJ Kippen</i> just said that about their kiss and he\u2019s right here and he\u2019s smiling and\u2014</p><p>\t<i>Yeah, </i>Cyrus thinks,<i> the thing about Reed doesn\u2019t matter at all.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>They curl up in the sleeping bags, trying to be warm from TJ\u2019s fan and the waves of cold coming from the window. And they talk and talk and talk. Cyrus thinks: <i>perfect perfect perfect </i>until his mind overloads and is, for once, quiet.</p><p>\tQuiet until, strangely like a horror movie, someone bangs on the door.</p><p>\tTJ sits up, rubbing his eyes, and frowns over at Cyrus.</p><p>\t\u201cGet up, lovebirds!\u201d It\u2019s Andi\u2019s voice. Then Amber knocks down the door, possibly with a kick, and runs over to them.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus says, like he just woke up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNope! We\u2019re sleeping downstairs. Bring the sleeping bags,\u201d Amber announces, reaching out a hand for TJ. He takes it and reluctantly stands up, looking between Andi and his sister.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re glowing. What\u2019s going on?\u201d <i>Glowing.</i> Cyrus hopes, for Andi\u2019s sake, it means what he thinks it means.</p><p>\t\u201cI never kiss and tell,\u201d Amber says, with narrowed eyes and a tiny grin. Andi doubles over coughing, stands up, and shoves Amber to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d TJ gapes at the two of them. Cyrus only stands up, shrugs, and gives TJ a look that says: <i>you\u2019ll figure it out someday.\u00a0</i></p><p>\t\u201cThey grow up so fast,\u201d Andi says, smiling at Cyrus and TJ. When Cyrus frowns, Andi shrugs. \u201cWe did say we were your mothers earlier.\u201d Laughing, Cyrus gathers up the sleeping bags and throws one of them into TJ\u2019s arms.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s go, people!\u201d Amber shouts, laughing, and the four of them race and tumble down the stairs toward the basement. Andi nearly trips on the fourth step down, but TJ catches her, then pushes her back to her feet with a flourish. Cyrus tosses his sleeping back to the ground below and Amber jumps on top of it, sticks the landing, tosses her hair, and looks back up at them.</p><p>\t\u201cJonah! Buffy!\u201d Andi shouts. In a split second, the pair appears around the corner, looking only slightly guilty.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cGrab some pillows,\u201d Amber directs Buffy. \u201cTJ, run up to mom\u2019s room and pull down some blankets and comforters. Jonah, you go too,\u201d she orders, a mirror of earlier.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi, Amber, and Cyrus go about clearing the space around the couch, and Amber drags the coffee table off to the side. Once the other four return, chaos fills the room, as sleeping bags and pillows are laid on the ground, and other pillow walls are thrown up:<br>\n\t\u201cUse the ottoman\u2014\u201c<br>\n\t\u201cNo, not that one, it\u2019s too comfortable to be a ceiling\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cOne, two, three\u2026 six pillows, okay good\u2014\u201c<br>\n\t\u201cTJ! Stop flirting with Cyrus!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh! Throw some fairy lights over the top. And turn off the rest in the room.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat last comment is Amber, and as her vision takes shape, she holds onto Andi. The pillow fort is decidedly big enough for six people, and though it may collapse sometime during the night, no one seems to care.</p><p>\t\u201cWe do make a good team,\u201d Cyrus decides, looking over their creation. \u201cAll six of us.\u201d</p><p>\tAcross the room, Andi thinks about how three years ago, this sleepover would have been a fever dream. She clutches to the memory of an hour ago, when she and Amber whispered words they each never though they could say aloud to each other. She thinks about every single complex relationship in this room: couples and crushes and ex-crushes and best friends and tentative rivals and mending friendships and twins. She thinks about how they all made it here, today.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey all collapse into the fort together, on knees and elbows and backs. Jonah clicks on the last string of lights, giving them dim brightness to see by.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTruth or dare?\u201d Amber whispers, and someone throws a pillow at her.</p><p>\t\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Cyrus says quietly, cuddled up somewhere in the middle of TJ and Buffy. He thanks silently in his mind\u2014of all people\u2014Amber, for organizing this, so they can all breathe and share and confess in the same space together. A chorus of goodnights echoes back to him: his friends. His <i>friends</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\tOutside, the snow hasn\u2019t stopped, and it piles down across streets and sidewalks and front yards. While the Kippen house\u2014eventually\u2014sleeps, lights twinkle in the sky, and the night goes on.\u00a0</p><p><b>END PART 2</b></p>",

His mouth falls agape, though, as he stares at Amber.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSpin the <i>bottle</i>?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi leans a little more on Amber, laughs nervously, then laughs with more certainty. \u201cNo, spin the baby tater. Of course spin the bottle!\u201d Cyrus gives her a worried look, putting a noticeable space between himself and TJ, who runs to the lights and flicks them back on.</p><p>\tBuffy offers no comment, just taps Jonah\u2019s shoulder so she\u2019ll let him down. Then she accidentally bumps shoulders with him as they stumble over to the couch and sit down next to each other. Jonah feels the nerves on his skin stand up at the wisp of contact: a quiet shock.</p><p>\tStill stepping around fairy lights, Andi whispers something furtively to Amber, who bites her lip and shrugs. Then, regaining her composure, she smiles and runs back over to the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWho has a bottle? A water bottle\u2014uh, Buffy? You\u2019re a runner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tBuffy raises her eyebrows but pulls a water bottle from seemingly out of nowhere with no visible reluctance. It\u2019s silvery and dented and clearly not meant for playing spin the bottle in basements, but then again they\u2019re not exactly meant for this either. Jonah glances around the room, and tallies: TJ has never dated anyone, Cyrus and TJ probably like each other, Buffy hasn\u2019t dated anyone except Marty, Amber doesn\u2019t seem to date anymore, as a rule, Andi had Walker and Jonah and then no one else every again, and Jonah\u2014</p><p>\tIt occurs to Jonah that he\u2019s dated the most people out of everyone in this room. And that he\u2019s kissed not one, but three girls.</p><p>\tIt also occurs to him that the first and only girl who has made him understand the expression <i>butterflies in your stomach</i> is sitting in this room. Next to him. Holding a bottle.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay!\u201d Amber shouts, snatching the bottle from Buffy and depositing it on the coffee table in front of the couch. Cyrus hastily picks up the remnants of the cinnamon cookies, glancing at TJ, then chucks them in the corner. Neither of the Kippens comment, and Amber continues speaking. \u201cSo\u2026.\u201d she sighs. \u201cWe should probably not do the lips, considering only, what\u2014two?\u2014of the people in this room have had their first kiss?\u201d</p><p>\tEyes flash to Jonah, and to Andi. Jonah feels Buffy watching him from his left, but he doesn\u2019t react. He meets Andi\u2019s eyes across the couch, who is grinning sheepishly. They\u2019ve talked about it\u2014awkwardly\u2014before: how they\u2019re first kiss was in middle school, and strangely spontaneous, and in plain view of several other people.\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah remembers another kiss\u2014then winces at the memory. It was his last kiss with Kira, under fluorescent roller skating lights. Two weeks later Jonah\u2019s stray physics homework and skateboard stickers had been evicted from Kira\u2019s house, and Jonah was no longer welcome at the Jefferson high school girls basketball games. Buffy had consoled him, which had always felt like a big thing: Buffy choosing Jonah over Kira. But maybe she wasn\u2019t, because Kira and Buffy still kept their tentative, basketball-centric, passive-aggressive friendship around.\u00a0</p><p>\tMaybe it didn\u2019t matter. Jonah wanted his slate to be wiped clean. He wanted to be like Amber or Cyrus tonight, never having kissed someone and still dying to find out. He wanted\u2014</p><p>\tLike a pesky firefly, a thought pricked at his mind: he wanted Buffy to have been his first.</p><p>\tBut this is what he gets, tonight. Buffy leans a little into him, still shaping a smile at Andi: her best friend. Then, finally, she speaks:</p><p>\t\u201cIf two people spin each other twice, seven minutes in heaven.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAmber lets out a scream of excitement, twisting in her seat. \u201cPerfect\u2014wait, one more thing.\u201d She jumps from the couch and hurries back to the light switch, flipping it and leaving the room in suspended darkness, pinpointed with various strings of light. There\u2019s enough light to see the faces of each person sitting around the couch, in this order: Jonah, Buffy, Amber, Andi, Cyrus, TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI better not spin you, Driscoll,\u201d TJ says jokingly, in a way that says he asking for forgiveness, for the tenth or twentieth or fiftieth time. Part of Jonah wants TJ to say something to him with the same look in his eyes, because Jonah is sick and tired of wanting move on from middle school things\u2014it\u2019s why he went with TJ to get the decorations, it\u2019s why he likes to spend time around Buffy and TJ together: because they\u2019re all forgiving each other, in their own ways, for what happened months and years ago.</p><p>\tJonah knows, also, that part of the reconciliation is on his shoulders. And that it\u2019s not a thing for here, tonight.</p><p>\tBuffy scoffs at TJ\u2019s remark, but Jonah sees that she\u2019s smiling.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIf I spin Jonah, we have to remake the moment in the Red Rooster,\u201d Andi says, and Jonah blinks in surprise.</p><p>\t\u201cSo we\u2019ll have to do it awkwardly with everyone watching?\u201d</p><p>\tAndi chucks a pillow at him, and Jonah lets out a breath like a laugh. He\u2019s glad, then, that they can joke like this.</p><p>\t\u201cActually,\u201d Amber says, with a realization, \u201cthree people in this room have had their first kiss.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cFour,\u201d Cyrus interrupts, frowning. \u201cI had\u2014I mean, Iris kissed me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ shifts in his seat.</p><p>\t\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Buffy says, sitting up from her laid back position. \u201cRaise your hand if you\u2019ve had your first kiss.</p><p>\tJonah and Andi are the first to place their hands in the air. Then Cyrus, following his prior statement. Then\u2014TJ?</p><p>\tBuffy and Amber are left with their hands down and mouths working. But Jonah looks over at TJ, thinking about how he\u2019s never had a girlfriend. Never had a boyfriend, either.</p><p>\t\u201cTJ?\u201d Andi says, as if reading Jonah\u2019s mind.</p><p>\tHe shrugs and leans back. Amber glances over at\u2014Jonah, of all people, but then shakes her head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re still not doing lips. Not unless you both want to.\u201d</p><p>\tCyrus nods in assent, and it\u2019s decided.\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah is so close to Buffy. And he\u2019s holding his breath. He doesn\u2019t know if he wants her to spin him or not, him to spin her or not, for the two of them to end up facing each other in a Kippen closet. Because Jonah doesn\u2019t want to also have to face an awful truth that might exist: that Buffy would never, ever like him.</p><p>\tBuffy bumps his shoulder, and he bumps back, heartbeat fluttering. There\u2019s cookies and lights and singing, and then there is Buffy\u2019s shoulder brushing his. Two different planes of existence.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll spin first!\u201d Andi calls out, breaking the silence. Jonah sees the last glance she gives Amber, ripe with something in the curve of her eyebrows and quirk of her mouth. Then she steps to the bottle, grips the neck, and spins it around and around and around and\u2014</p><p>\tWhen it stops, it\u2019s pointing directly at him.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2014\u00a0</p><p>\tBuffy watches her best friend spin the boy sitting next to her, and she manages to maintain her calm. Andi and Jonah\u2014old news. Jonah hitches a breath, shakes his head, then leans over and lets Andi peck his cheek. It\u2019s too much like the first Red Rooster kiss, feeling anticlimactic yet so exposed. When Jonah sits back, he doesn\u2019t look at Buffy.</p><p>\tBuffy, who doesn\u2019t blush, as a rule, can feel her face turning red.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, then. Next?\u201d Amber says, nodding in Jonah\u2019s direction. Buffy eyes the bottle intently, as he tips it around in a circle. She wonders, for a moment, if Andi and Jonah would kiss in the closet if he spun it back around to Andi.\u00a0</p><p>\tCommon sense, for once, cuts into her mind and reminds her of a simple fact: Andi is head over heels for Amber. Jonah is\u2014</p><p>\tWell, Jonah is a question mark.</p><p>\tIn the split second while Buffy considers all of this, the bottle swings nearly 360 degrees and lands, with no hesitation, facing her.</p><p>\t\u201cLovebirds!\u201d TJ calls out, but Buffy doesn\u2019t hear him. Her heart is beating too fast.</p><p>\tJonah, who looks only slightly ruffled, leans in, and, quick as a feather or a snowflake, dusts her cheek with a kiss. It takes Buffy longer than half a second to jerk away at the unexpectedness. Then, because she\u2019s tired of being ashamed, she turns to meet Jonah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cNext time, warn me before you lean in, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Next time</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\tBuffy doesn\u2019t know why she says it, except she definitely knows why she says it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhatever you say, Slayer,\u201d Jonah says, a beat too late, and nudges her shoulder.</p><p>\tIt feels like a moment. It feels like something.</p><p>\tWhile Amber pushes the bottle over toward her, Buffy replays several things in her head all at once:<br><i>One:</i> the day she met Jonah Beck. It was before Andi and the Good Hair Crew all latched onto him. It was before frisbee lessons with Bex and bracelets and all of that. Buffy had been walking home from Jefferson, crossing the fields where the Space Otters were practicing. A younger version of the Jonah next to her now had thrown a frisbee at her feet, eyebrows enticing. Sharp and suspicious and so very Buffy-like, she had picked it up and turned it over in her hands. Jonah finally reached out to take it, and she pulled it back, then threw it over his head to the girl behind him, who caught it squarely in her hands. \u201cJonah,\u201d he said, then, and she nodded. It wasn\u2019t until Andi introduced them later, and their paths crossed truly, that she lent him back her name. And it wasn\u2019t until months later, when the trust was real between them, that she gave her name to him, to have and share and keep as friends.</p><p>\t<i>Two: </i>the day Marty almost kissed her. It was like clockwork at that point: Buffy flopped down on the futon in Marty\u2019s room, unlaced her running shoes, and started on her physics homework. Marty spun around in his chair, tapping a pen against his chin, and attempted math homework while actually looking up runners on <i>milesplit.com</i>. It had been a Tuesday, that much she remembered. She asked Marty to come help her with something, and he trailed over, with tired eyes. They were sitting next to her, and Buffy felt something like a warm energy swelling inside her. She had <i>liked </i>Marty: ferociously, confidently, after their middle school falling out, for almost all of ninth grade. She couldn\u2019t deny it, any more than she could deny the way her heartbeat skipped when Jonah\u2019s kissed her cheek. But back then\u2014she wasn\u2019t ready, even then, to kiss anyone. It was hard to know if she ever would be\u2014sure, kisses on cheek and holding hands and arms around each other were all wonderful. But a kiss, on the lips? When Marty leaned in, Buffy\u2019s heart skipped, but not in a good way. She felt something essential break between them, just as she had two years earlier when Marty left her on the bridge. And it couldn\u2019t be the same again, and it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\t<i>Three</i>: the feeling in her stomach moments ago when Jonah pecked her on the cheek. Bumped her arm. Carried her on his shoulders so she could throw glittery pieces of paper at the ceiling. Days ago, ate baby taters in the booth across from her. She doesn\u2019t need to explain it any more; it\u2019s there.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s there, and he bumped her shoulder.</p><p>\tBuffy spins the bottle, and, because the world is just <i>like that</i>, it lands on the person sitting nearly directly across from her: TJ Kippen.</p><p>\t\u201cNope.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s the rules of the game,\u201d Andi says, holding back a laugh.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to kiss TJ Kippen,\u201d Buffy announces, standing up in her seat, \u201cthen you\u2019ve got\u2014ah\u2014\u201c<br>\n\tBuffy stops when TJ himself gets up, runs over, jumps on the couch, and pecks her on the cheek, all in about two seconds, looking annoyingly pleased with himself. TJ shakes his head once he does it, and Buffy gags, fake retching over the side of the couch. She doesn\u2019t look down at Jonah\u2019s face\u2014she\u2019s not sure she wants to see it.</p><p>\t\u201cGross!\u201d she yells at TJ\u2019s retreating figure, back over to Cyrus, who gives him a tentative high five.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot as gross as you!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re the one who <i>kissed </i>me!\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cWell were you going to do it?\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSettle down,\u201d Amber says, grinning. She glances at Andi; so much of their conversation seems to be in exchanges like that, small looks and knowing eyes. Buffy notices; how could she not?</p><p>\t\u201cNope. I need to go wash my mouth out,\u201d Buffy insists, hopping off the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe didn\u2019t even\u2014\u201c TJ protests. Buffy throws him a look, and runs off to the sink.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tThe tint of pinpoint lights and the sparkle of the snow outside the window are starting to hurt Cyrus\u2019s eyes. Otherwise in the dark, he\u2019s snuggled in the couch next to TJ, neither of them saying much. He keeps replaying the moment in his head, over and over: a pinky linked to his, two palms against each other, fingers interlocked. He keeps going back to how TJ was the one who curled his pinky over Cyrus\u2019s, how TJ was the one whose heartbeat he felt beating in sync with his in the contact of their wrists.</p><p>\tNow, they sit only inches apart, but their hands are separate.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe wishes he could know what TJ is thinking right now. He wishes he knew what <i>he </i>is thinking right now. Feelings, Cyrus has learned, are difficult.</p><p>\tActually, difficult is a poor way to put it. It\u2019s something more than difficult to know someone for three years, to know them <i>well</i> for two, and to have feelings for approximately two\u2014maybe more, maybe less. It\u2019s impossible, almost, to hang out and sleepover and talk and text for hours and <i>hold hands </i>with the boy he\u2019s so desperately enamored with, and to never say the words out loud. To Buffy and Andi, who spill back about their crushes (well, Buffy doesn\u2019t, but Cyrus figures she\u2019s figuring out how to manage the past with Marty and the future with Jonah), to them it\u2019s easy. But he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll ever say it out loud to TJ. Or if he ever wants to.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cEarth to Cyrus!\u201d Andi says, and he\u2019s back in the land of the living. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spun.\u201d<br>\n\tCyrus nods, sleepily, then glances down at the bottle. Pointing at him, accusingly. He glances up, counts off in his head what\u2019s occurred so far. Then\u2014</p><p>\t<i>Crap.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>TJ Kippen is looking over at him, uneasily. Everyone else is smiling at them, but Cyrus can\u2019t see them. He sees TJ, who doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do. It feels like he\u2019s nervous, which can\u2019t possibly be true\u2014he just kissed Buffy Driscoll with apparently no regard for his own life. But he\u2019s hesitating now.</p><p>\tEvery time something happens that might just means TJ could possibly like him, Cyrus feels his heart smiling inside.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cGo on,\u201d someone whispers across the circle. And so TJ does, and Cyrus\u2019s shoulders bristle and his mind goes blank and his stomach fills with violently present butterflies and TJ kisses him about two inches from his lips.</p><p>\tAnd Cyrus, who was trying to maintain calm, feels a supernova explode from that point. A small one, but a supernova nonetheless. It\u2019s the sting of the nerves and the warmth of his skin that reminds him (as if he didn\u2019t know already) that this is something he likes, that this boy in front of him is cute and attractive and magnetic.\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus is the one to pull away, because his erratic breathing is giving him away. (In the back of his head, he thinks: <i>and that was only on the cheek</i>.) But he puts that thought away, and falls back, breathless next to TJ, who looks a little sick and a lot happy.</p><p>\tHe misses the knowing look between Andi and Buffy, as if they\u2019re his wingwomen, and the smile Amber gives Jonah, because all of them ship this more than anything. Cyrus misses it, because he\u2019s thinking about TJ.</p><p>\tHe wants to say something, but what is there to say? So he doesn\u2019t, just silently takes the bottle in his hand and pauses only a moment before giving it a half-hearted spin.</p><p>\tBowie Quinn, Cyrus thinks, as the bottle slows to a stop, is right about the universe.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe cap is directed, irrefutably, toward the only one in the room Cyrus was afraid he would spin.</p><p>\t\u201cCloset!\u201d Buffy yells, and Cyrus thinks of the irony of it.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything\u2019s almost like a dream: the fairy lights, Andi\u2019s encouraging smile, TJ getting to his feet and stumbling over to the closet, followed by Cyrus. Everything\u2019s a haze, because this is not what Cyrus thought would happen tonight\u2014just the two of them, alone in a closet. A closet!<br>\n\tCyrus nearly doesn\u2019t make it the door. It\u2019s not an overstatement to say his vision might be a little blurry. Or maybe that\u2019s the dark.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen they both go in the closet and shut the door, it\u2019s still dark.</p><p>\tCyrus doesn\u2019t allow himself to think it too loudly, but he\u2019s <i>hoping.</i></p><p><i>\u2014</i></p><p><i>\t</i>TJ\u2019s mind short-circuited when he kissed Cyrus\u2019s cheek. TJ\u2019s mind short-circuited on his math final only days ago. TJ\u2019s mind stopped functioning for a moment when the Jefferson girls\u2019 basketball team won the championship last year, and Buffy Driscoll actually gave his broken-ACL-crutches self a <i>hug</i>.</p><p>\tHe\u2019s thanking his lucky stars that somehow, his mind is working right now.</p><p>\tCyrus\u2019s cheeks are still a little red, and TJ knows his are too, especially after the second spin. They walk to the closet, around the corner and out of sight of the rest of everyone.</p><p>\t\u201cI guess we\u2019re the lucky ones, huh?\u201d TJ says, holding the closet door open for Cyrus, who nods but doesn\u2019t say anything in return. Once the door swings shut, they\u2019re left in utter darkness. TJ swears softly and fumbles around the walls, searching for the switch. It\u2019s his house\u2014he really should know where the closet light is. But it\u2019s Cyrus who finds it, tugging on a string suspended from the ceiling and gazing over at TJ with dark eyes.</p><p>\tTJ wants, and he wants, and he wants. He wants with his eyes open and shut and when Cyrus looks over at him he almost kisses him then and there.</p><p>\tBut the two of them settle across from each other in the crowded closet, on opposite sides. TJ picks a spot on the wall just above Cyrus to rest his eyes.</p><p>\tSilence flickers for a moment before Cyrus shuffles and crosses the room to stand next to him. Cyrus, ever the brave one, always the strong one. TJ is so proud; there\u2019s not a drop of jealousy left in him. There used to be, back in middle school, when Cyrus had both Buffy and Andi and TJ had no one except maybe Reed. But it\u2019s all gone.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe light above them blinks, and in the space between darkness and light, TJ\u2019s hand ends up pressed against Cyrus\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t know how it happens, but it does. Like earlier, their hands intertwine, pressed together, and pull their sides against each other. TJ feels his breathing go shallow. When was the moment that Cyrus could first make him breathless? Maybe at the swings that second time. Maybe when he went to Cyrus\u2019s house and they sat, inches apart, watching made-for-tv movies last winter. Maybe every time they almost held hands, and the twice now that they truly have. And still are.</p><p>\tMinutes stack on top of each other and pile up, and TJ begins to realize he may be running out of time. For what? He can\u2019t exactly shape his intentions in his mind. But he knows.</p><p>\tAfter what seems like an eternity, Cyrus\u2019s hand twitches in his, and TJ decides he can\u2019t keep waiting, just like when he first pushed his hand into Cyrus\u2019s. He swings around, looking over at Cyrus, who looks back, almost afraid.</p><p>\tTheir faces are nearly touching, illuminated in the dusty closet light and opposites in a photographic negative.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus says, so delicately, like he could break the word with too much force. TJ\u2019s heart is flickering, fluttering, existing. \u201cDid you\u2014did you want to do seven minutes in heaven?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ sees the question break his face, sees Cyrus begin to ask himself why he said it. But TJ, again, sees the bravery splayed across his nervous mouth and endless eyes. His heartbeat hammers in his chest; it wants out.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe squeezes Cyrus\u2019s hand, and it\u2019s warm. \u201cOnly with you.\u201d</p><p>\tIt feels like the bravest thing he\u2019s ever said.</p><p>\tIt feels like the heartbeat in Cyrus\u2019s wrist is screaming against his.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt feels like something he was missing is almost, almost there.</p><p>\tHe sees Cyrus smile, and he sees the hand in his move upwards as the body attached to it shifts towards him. Instinctively, he closes his eyes.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s Cyrus who pulled him out of the dark, when his parents and his friends and the awfulness inside him were drowning him and he couldn\u2019t breathe. It\u2019s Cyrus who listened, who <i>listened</i> and was there for him always and ever. It\u2019s Cyrus who held him while he choked on tears in ninth grade, having discovered his knee no longer wanted to function as a knee for nine months. It\u2019s Cyrus who knows the stories of his parents and his grandparents and his sister and his loneliness. It\u2019s Cyrus who reached out and took that loneliness from him. It\u2019s Cyrus who matters. And it\u2019s Cyrus, then, who pushes the last few inches\u2014they\u2019re so<i> close</i>\u2014and breathes into reality what was meant to be all this time.</p><p>\tIt\u2019s Cyrus who grips TJ\u2019s hand and kisses him, sweet and simple, all at once.</p><p>\tIn less than a second, Cyrus pulls back, and he\u2019s still close enough that TJ can feel his measured breath and taste the anxiousness. His brows are drawn together, dark eyes worried, as if he\u2019s made a mistake.\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ wants that look gone from Cyrus\u2019s face.</p><p>\tHe lets go of Cyrus\u2019s hand and wraps his arms around him, embracing him tightly as Cyrus finally relaxes. He holds him, he holds him, he holds him, like the world is new and this is all he knows. He holds Cyrus like it\u2019s been three years in the making, because it has.</p><p>\tCyrus is crying, crying and breathing: exhaling, finally. And eventually TJ pulls back from the embrace, only because he has something else he needs to do. Cyrus rubs his eyes, still gazing up at TJ, waiting for one of them to say something.</p><p>\tTJ doesn\u2019t have anything to say, now. But he crosses the distance between them once again, because he needs to, because he wants to. And this time, when they kiss, no one pulls away.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s muffins and it\u2019s swings and it\u2019s somersaults and it\u2019s hidden smiles and it\u2019s long phone calls and it\u2019s happiness, happiness, happiness.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tAmber is still laughing, watching TJ and Cyrus follow each other, mesmerized, into the closet. But everyone else looks on in wonder and maybe jealousy, wishing for <i>something.</i> Amber wants <i>something</i> too, but she doesn\u2019t want to allow herself to think about it.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Andi asks finally. \u201cIt\u2019s no one\u2019s turn.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou can spin,\u201d Amber interrupts, running a hand through her hair. \u201cI\u2019ll just assume we won\u2019t get either of them out of there for a while.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShould we set a timer, though?\u201d Jonah asks, already reaching for his phone. Amber shrugs and so Jonah sets it anyway, the seconds ticking away.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi picks up the bottle, tosses it around in her hands a few times, much to Buffy\u2019s chagrin. Then she drops it on the table, spinning it quickly and delicately. Amber watches Andi\u2019s hands tip the bottle, almost like she\u2019s piecing together the parts of a puzzle or a craft. And she watches Andi\u2019s spin push the bottle around seven times until it ends up, somehow unsurprisingly, pointing at Amber.</p><p>\tAmber has come to expect this. She thinks of their moment in the kitchen, hours ago, and wonders if Andi will even remember it tomorrow. She thinks about how Andi kissed Jonah so easily. She lets her own insecurity wash over her, because it\u2019s almost easier than thinking the possibility she hopes for could be true.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPucker up,\u201d Andi says jokingly, and Amber considers how bold Andi has become in the past year. Part of Amber thinks it\u2019s her own fault (not that she minds the change).\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi leans over, grinning, and kisses Amber on the cheek. It lasts half a second longer than the rest of the kisses, but it\u2019s hard for Amber to think anything of it. Not when Andi does it so casually, and flourishes her movements after the fact, grinning. It\u2019s even harder for Amber to imagine that Andi could kiss someone she had romantic feelings for like it\u2019s nothing.</p><p>\tAnd Amber has seen this before: it\u2019s the air that gay girls breathe. Friendships so deep they might as well be romances, but to one half of the pairing, they could never be. Texting late into the night, sharing anything and everything, even holding hands. Amber doesn\u2019t want that to be what\u2019s between her and Andi; she really, desperately doesn\u2019t. But she thinks of the unspoken jokes between them, of text threads that extend into tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd she takes the bottle, not wanting to let herself keep thinking.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey Amber,\u201d Buffy says suddenly. \u201cRemember when Cyrus forced us to have a therapy session to reconcile?\u201d</p><p>\tAmber winces, because memories of that come with memories of things she and Andi have already put behind them: ferris wheels and marker hearts and hatred.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, I remember. We hated each other,\u201d she responds carefully. Beside her, Andi studies the couch, contemplating.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Buffy says, all too suddenly again. \u201cFor hating you for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\tIt\u2019s the strangest apology, out of place and in the wrong time. They\u2019ve made up dozens of times before, or they wouldn\u2019t be here, in the same house, about to have a sleepover.</p><p>\tAnd yet.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Amber says, softer than she\u2019s ever said most anything. \u201cI was awful, and I should\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>\tAndi is looking directly at Jonah, unable to take a side in this. So Amber keeps her gaze locked on Buffy\u2019s, who looks\u2014gentler. More open.</p><p>\t\u201cI just wanted to say it,\u201d Buffy says, \u201cso we can finally, finally move on.\u201d</p><p>\tAmber smiles, then. \u201cLook at us. Cyrus had to bring us in for relationship therapy and now we\u2019re all helping him and TJ\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cHang out,\u201d Jonah cuts in, with a grin. Amber imagines if her brother were here, the reconciliation might finally be complete: Buffy and TJ, TJ and Jonah, Jonah and Amber, Amber and Buffy. But TJ\u2019s not here, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s enough to know that Andi\u2019s best friend\u2014that <i>Buffy</i>\u2014forgives her. That she wants to move on.</p><p>\t\u201cTime to spin the bottle?\u201d Buffy asks, hopefully. Amber is struck, suddenly, with how the spiky outer shell of middle-school Buffy has softened into kindness and strength.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou got it.\u201d Amber drops the bottle in the middle and spins it. And spins it and spins it until:</p><p>\t\u201cI guess we really are throwing it back,\u201d Andi laughs, the first word she\u2019s spoken in a few minutes. The bottle declares her destiny, with no regrets: Jonah Beck.</p><p>\tJonah Beck: the only boy to ever catch Amber Kippen\u2019s eye. Jonah Beck: a question mark. Jonah Beck: certainly not who she wanted to be kissing tonight.</p><p>\tStill, Amber leans across Buffy to peck Jonah on the cheek. She wants it to be nothing, but she also wants it to be something final. Something Andi can see and know: the past is past. All of it.</p><p>\tAs Amber leans back, and Jonah makes no expression at all, Amber thinks about how things from so long ago still affect them today. She doesn\u2019t want eighth grade Amber, the one who was struggling so badly with her parents that she lashed out at everyone around her, to be the one they all remember. The one who comes to mind. And she\u2019s been trying to erase that version of herself for so long\u2014over two years.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s worn out and cliche, but Amber\u2019s so tired of being the mean girl. She wonders if apologizing to Buffy and kissing Jonah Beck is enough. She wonders if anything will ever be enough.</p><p>\t\u201cMy turn,\u201d Jonah says hurriedly, cutting the silence. He spins it again, and lands on\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014Buffy.\u00a0</p><p>\tAmber\u2019s suspected the both of them for long enough, and as they go off into the closet, Andi also wears a smug smile. And then it\u2019s just the two of them: Amber and Andi. Isn\u2019t it always?</p><p>\tMoments after Jonah and Buffy leave, the timer on Buffy\u2019s phone goes off, signifying the end of TJ and Cyrus\u2019s seven minutes. Andi gives Amber a look that asks: <i>are you going to go get them?</i> Amber gives her back a look that says: <i>no, are you crazy?</i> Andi deactivates the alarm in agreement. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow do you think they\u2019re doing?\u201d Amber asks out loud.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly? Thriving,\u201d Andi says. \u201cI hope Jonah and Buffy are too.\u201d There\u2019s something unspoken there: the last two left.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd us?\u201d Amber asks.</p><p>\t\u201cTired,\u201d Andi admits. \u201cDrained from finals. Full of peanut butter sandwiches and cinnamon cookies.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTired?\u201d Amber says, like it\u2019s a shock. \u201cIt\u2019s only about ten thirty, and you never sleep\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI never sleep,\u201d Andi agrees. \u201cBut suddenly I feel like I could sleep for days. Maybe it was the snow this morning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMayhaps someone made too many snow angels?\u201d Amber asks.</p><p>\t\u201cMayhaps <i>someone</i> threw about a hundred snowballs at me.\u201d</p><p>\tAmber reaches up and swats at one of the stray strings of light above their heads. \u201cHow long do you think the snow\u2019s going to last?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBex and I have decided two days at the most. Enough time to go to the alpine slide.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThe alpine slide?? In the snow?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJust a little tradition I have with my parents. Buffy, Cyrus, and I used to go in the fall but we haven\u2019t since\u2026 a certain disaster.\u201d</p><p>\tAndi leans back on Amber\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou know, spin the bottle doesn\u2019t make much sense if everyone ends up in the closet at once\u2014wait a minute, which closet did Jonah and Buffy go in? If TJ and Cyrus are in the other ones?\u201d</p><p>\tAmber shrugs. \u201cThe second dimension one. They\u2019re actually both in the same closet at once, but in different metaphysical spaces.\u201d</p><p>\tTurning around to look directly at Amber, inches away from her nose, Andi narrows her eyes. \u201cEither you\u2019re on drugs or you\u2019re a nerd.\u201d<br>\n\tAmber stretches back: anything to get away from Andi\u2019s very present bright eyes and tiny smile. \u201cTJ\u2019s the nerd, not me.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cDrugs it is, then.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou got me,\u201d Amber mumbles, fading off. And then, like a scene from a dream, Andi reaches up and twirls a strand of Amber\u2019s hair between her fingers, eyes half-lidded.</p><p>\t\u201cI <i>am</i> tired,\u201d Andi asserts. Amber keeps holding her breath.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you fall asleep on me, I\u2019ll draw a mustache on your face,\u201d Amber teases, and Andi stops twirling her hair, turns around and tilts her chin up so she\u2019s staring right at Amber.</p><p>\t\u201cIf you draw a mustache on my face, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Andi, for once, comes up short of words.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d Amber asks, smiling. If Andi can flirt like it\u2019s nothing, then so can she. She winks down at Andi. \u201cThrow snowballs at me?\u201d</p><p>\tAndi sighs and rolls her eyes, but she\u2019s grinning too. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll put snow in your sleeping bag. There.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll craft me to death?\u201d Amber continues, ignoring Andi\u2019s remark.</p><p>\t\u201cHey! You\u2019ve already seen my baking skills, which include wielding a large wooden spoon. Don\u2019t test me.\u201dAndi scrambles up to sit, legs tucked beneath her, and positions herself about two inches from Amber\u2019s nose. \u201cDraw the mustache, get the spoon.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cHm. I seem to remember a very different course of events involving the spoon than you do. As in, I took yours and cornered you.\u201d Amber moves a centimeter closer to Andi, lets herself breathe. She can do this. She can keep up.</p><p>\t\u201cAs in, you have the home field advantage right now. If we were at <i>my</i> apartment, I could best you in wooden spoon dueling any day.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to take you up on that offer,\u201d Amber says.</p><p>\t\u201cI guess you will. Although,\u201d she continues, \u201cI seriously doubt that all six of us could fit in my room to sleepover. Or even a huge pillow fort. So it would have to be just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWould your parents even let you have boys over to sleepover?\u201d Amber asks. She doesn\u2019t know why she says it. It sounds useless in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201c Andi says, then cuts off. She relaxes back against the couch, and it occurs to Amber that they never set a timer for Jonah and Buffy. But she doesn\u2019t want to remind Andi of that, because she\u2019s having too much fun now: exchanging words, laughing, being as close as possible without truly touching.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhich is why it\u2019s so surprising when Andi, out of nowhere, muffles a sob.</p><p>\tShe\u2019s still leaning back against the couch, chin pointed upward and throat exposed to the ceiling. Amber can see the beginning of tears forming in her eyes. <i>Fuck.</i> Had Amber made her cry?<br>\n\t\u201cAndi?\u201d</p><p>\tShe shakes her head and turns away, wiping the tear from her eye.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d Amber repeats, and reaches out a hand for her friend. Her <i>friend</i>, who needs her help right now, not hopeless pining.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi turns around and grips Amber\u2019s hand in her own, breathing fast. It\u2019s all so sudden. Amber wants to reach out and tuck back the strand of dark hair that has fallen in front of Andi\u2019s eyes. But she doesn\u2019t. Instead, she says: \u201cIs this\u2014is this about Buffy and Jonah and TJ and all of us?\u201d</p><p>\tOffering a sad laugh, Andi shakes her head. \u201cNo, not at all. You guys are all making up finally\u2014it\u2019s amazing. I want it to be forever.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know about <i>forever\u2014</i>\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cAmber, wait,\u201d Andi interrupts. \u201cI wanted to apologize to you. For\u2014\u201c\t</p><p>\t\u201cFor what? Middle school things? I\u2019m the one who should be apologizing; I\u2019m sorry\u2014I am\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d Andi says, and the word is full of tears. \u201cI want to apologize for\u2014for\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAndi cuts herself off, not once, but twice. She shakes her head, rubs her eyes, squeezes Amber\u2019s hand which is miraculously still holding Andi\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d Amber says, so soft that the word could be a feather.</p><p>\t\u201cI have something. Something that I\u2019ve wanted to tell you, for so, <i>so </i>long. And it sits on the tip of my tongue every time I have a conversation, especially with you, but I bury it inside, and I just can\u2019t live with myself anymore because I need to tell you so <i>bad</i>, Amber. I need to. And I couldn\u2019t sit here and laugh and talk anymore because I need to say it like I need air to breathe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe room, for once, is silent.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it,\u201d Andi says, so quiet Amber almost doesn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\tAmber waits.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tSeconds tick off: one, two, three. The same measure as Amber\u2019s heartbeats.</p><p>\t\u201cAmber,\u201d Andi whispers. \u201cI\u2019m bisexual.\u201d</p><p>\tAnd now she\u2019s crying. And now they\u2019re both crying. And now Amber can\u2019t see anything, can\u2019t think anything except this: <i>i love her i love her i love her i love her she\u2019s crying she\u2019s crying.</i></p><p>\tAnd now Amber takes Andi\u2019s other hand, and says: \u201cAndi. Andi. Andi, you are the most amazing, bravest person I know. Thank you for telling\u2014<i>thank you</i>, Andi\u2014I love you\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAmber hugs her, and Andi stays limp for one moment, in shock, before she hugs back, and their tears mix, and she rest her exhausted eyelids on Amber\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to say,\u201d Andi says, quietly. \u201cI\u2019m so <i>tired </i>of pretending to be someone I\u2019m not, only because I haven\u2019t said two words out loud. It feels like lying.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Amber says back, immediately, because she knows <i>exactly</i> how Andi feels, what it means to have a piece of her that she has to show the world, or else she\u2019s living a lie.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Andi echoes, and Amber wants so badly right now to tell her that she\u2019s not alone. She needs to. A glance around the room tells her that the other four are still in their respective closets (fuck, that\u2019s symbolic), and that Buffy\u2019s water bottle rests, forgotten, on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCome on,\u201d Amber whispers, keeping her right hand firmly in Andi\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014um\u2014let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d It\u2019s the only way she\u2019ll be able to get it out, if the two of them are alone. And she wants to. She wants to so bad, to reciprocate it and be able to exhale. Andi has finally given her the bravery to do it. (And why wouldn\u2019t it be Andi, the first girl Amber ever truly fell for, and the strongest person Amber knows, who gave her enough strength to say the words herself?)</p><p>\tAnd so they scramble up the stairs, tears still falling and hands permanently entangled. Amber\u2019s room is dimly lit, with snow on the windowpanes. She flips on the lamp and falls onto the bed, holding her breath. She wants to let it out so bad.</p><p>\tAndi tumbles down next to her, eyes unseeing, probably still processing what she\u2019s said out loud.</p><p>\t\u201cAndi,\u201d Amber says quietly, just like she said moments earlier. Andi turns to face her.</p><p>\t<i>Just say the words. Just say them. Just do it.</i></p><p>\tA balancing, a gift, a secret. Amber wants Andi to understand she\u2019s not alone, she never will be, she\u2019s so love and loved and <i>loved.</i></p><p>\tAgain: \u201cAndi.\u201d</p><p>\tNeither of them are looking anywhere in particular now. Amber thinks: <i>she\u2019s so brave. </i>Amber thinks: <i>it\u2019s time to stop being miserable. And to start being brave.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>Then Amber stops thinking, and she speaks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m also\u2014I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m bi\u2014I like girls, oh my god I can\u2019t believe I just said that. I like girls. So I\u2019m gay, or something. I don\u2019t know if I like boys, I don\u2019t really know, I might\u2014\u201c</p><p>\tAndi is crashing into her before the rambling sentence can end. The second embrace is just like the first one, only better, because they\u2019ve both said it. They\u2019ve both said it.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>They\u2019ve </i>both <i>said it.</i></p><p>\tAndi is bisexual. Her crush is bisexual!\u2014Amber thinks, while crying into Andi\u2019s shoulder, with reckless happiness. It\u2019s not impossible\u2014it\u2019s not.</p><p>\tAnd then the tears keep coming.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s almost like that first night they held hands, because their fingers are still locked tightly together. But this time, they both fall back onto the bed, and they breathe, they breathe, they breathe. No more withholding breath like it\u2019s a tangible thing\u2014<i>well,</i> Amber thinks, <i>not until the worry about whether or not she likes me settles in, and the coming out to other people, and the distress about when and who and where. </i>But they made it. They both did.</p><p>\tAmber uses her palm to wipe away Andi\u2019s tears, and Andi does the same. And they lay back against Amber\u2019s comforter, all the words used up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHere they are: alive and ecstatic and apprehensive but so very free.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tWhen Buffy spins the bottle, it twirls back around, once, twice, then lands where it should, at a 180 degree angle right toward the boy next to her, because how could it not?</p><p>\tAndi gives her an approving smile and Buffy imagines and hopes Cyrus would give her a twin blessing. And so the two of them\u2014Buffy and Jonah, Jonah and Buffy\u2014stumble off to the closet, their hearts skipping beats in sync.</p><p>\tBuffy already has her hand on the doorknob to the first closet she sees before Jonah lets out a little gasp and grabs her wrist. \u201cNot that one,\u201d he whispers, nodding to the door. Buffy frowns, then remembers.</p><p>\t\u201cI almost just walked in on TJ Kippen and my best friend,\u201d Buffy snorts, pulling back her arm.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot good,\u201d Jonah says softly. \u201cWant to find another closet?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI suppose,\u201d Buffy says, twirling in a circle. Maybe it\u2019s the night, maybe it\u2019s the darkness of the Kippen basement hallways. But Buffy slides her wrist out from Jonah\u2019s hand and instead places her palm in his. Two hands, flat against each other, cupped together, and she drags him to the closet at the end of the hallway, which is, incidentally, about two feet wide and filled with books.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan we fit?\u201d Jonah whispers.</p><p>\t\u201cWe can make it work.\u201d Buffy pulls him into the closet, and his fingers flicker against the back of her hand. Once he pulls the door shut, and Buffy manages to click on the light switch next to the wall, she can see the dust cascading over every surface. Jonah coughs: once, twice, then grins sheepishly at her in the pale light.</p><p>\t\u201cAllergic to dust?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\t\u201cAllergic to dust.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI think I\u2019m allergic to sleep,\u201d Buffy says, leaning on the shelves on the wall. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten more than six hours in the past three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThis <i>is </i>a sleepover, so, were you planning to sleep tonight?\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy laughs sharply, tugging on Jonah\u2019s hand. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re worse than TJ,\u201d Jonah says, squinting.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to TJ,\u201d Buffy fires back, almost dropping his hand. Jonah laughs, in that Jonah Beck way: his eyes crinkle and his dimples deepen and he smiles with his teeth. Buffy, who has only ever been able to find a small group of individuals <i>attractive</i> in her entire life, thinks this needs to be added to the list. Thinks Jonah needs to be added to the list.\u00a0</p><p>\t16-year old Jonah Beck looks like the 13-year old Jonah Beck who first tossed her a frisbee, and he doesn\u2019t. The dimples and eyes are the same; the frame and height are not. Finally, in the end of eighth grade, Jonah shot up and reached her height so she could no longer tease him about being unable to touch the rim of a basketball hoop,or catch frisbees that were thrown too high. Now he still has the shadow of middle school heartthrob Jonah, but he has the essence of the Jonah who had his heart broken by Kira Summers freshman year. Buffy thinks about how she\u2019s known him all this time: skateboards and frisbees and attempted posters for Kira and all of it. She didn\u2019t really start to like him until this calendar year, not until after she and Marty ended up in pieces, and Kira and Jonah were done for good. After that it was movies at Jonah\u2019s house, it was skating down main street and stopping at Karl\u2019s to watch basketball on tv. It was Jonah and Buffy, unattached.</p><p>\t\u201cHey Buffy,\u201d Jonah says. \u201cLook what book\u2019s behind you.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy spins around, still gripping Jonah\u2019s hand, and scans the shelves. Her eyes land immediately on the one he wants her to pick out: <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Between their joint performance in English class of the balcony scene, and Andi\u2019s earlier remark, it feels like a vital piece of their relationship.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRemember when I fell?\u201d Buffy says, then starts to laugh. She had been attempting to stand on top of a desk and emulate Juliet\u2019s stance, but the legs had wobbled too much underneath her and she had tumbled directly on top of Jonah.</p><p>\t\u201cHow could I forget? I was only permanently scarred by your nails scratching me.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cIt was just payback for that one time you skated into me.\u201d</p><p>\tJonah laughs, shrugging, then pulls her back from the shelf so they\u2019re facing. And Buffy doesn\u2019t want to wait anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJonah, do you have a crush?\u201d</p><p>\tA beat.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUm. Yes.\u201d A second pause, then: \u201cSomeone at the sleepover.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy inhales, then curses herself for it, because she\u2019s showing her hand. She wants so badly for Jonah to say it\u2019s her, but she\u2019s already running through all of the other people it could be: Andi, Amber\u2014he denied it before, but still. Maybe it\u2019s TJ or Cyrus. Buffy doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0</p><p>\tTheir hands are still entangled tightly together, but neither of them seems to realize it. Instead, Buffy scoots a tiny bit closer to Jonah, and asks:\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAndi?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with that, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAmber?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah laughs. \u201cDidn\u2019t I already explain this?\u201d</p><p>\t<i>Then who?</i> Buffy doesn\u2019t dare to hope.</p><p>\t\u201cIs it\u2026 TJ? Cyrus?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah shakes his head to both names, and Buffy notices the way his lips inflect at the mention of boys\u2019 names: not like he\u2019s surprised, like he\u2019s resigned. Another story for another time.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tightens his hold on her hand, and twists the hairband on her wrist. Buffy\u2019s waiting, waiting, waiting, just like she has for years, through Andi and Libby and Kira. She wasn\u2019t waiting for Jonah, at first, but she was waiting for this moment.</p><p>\t\u201cJonah,\u201d she says carefully. He flicks up his green-blue eyes at her, captured under thin eyelashes. He\u2019s so <i>nice</i> to look at, so considerate and talented and stupid, sometimes. \u201cIs it\u2014is it\u2014me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe half closes her eyes, preparing to wince. But that\u2019s only a reflex, because she\u2019s Buffy Driscoll. Buffy <i>Driscoll</i>, and she knows they\u2019re meant to be here, in the closet, in the dying light. She knows what the answer is, in a very Han-Solo-type way.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>\tPause.</p><p>\t\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy laughs, and it\u2019s in the confession that she sees Jonah\u2019s vulnerability. So she squeezes his hand, and says this:</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that\u2019s good. Considering I like you too.\u201d His eyes go wide.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014really?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally, Jonah Beck. I really do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tJonah stares in amazement, and Buffy stares right back, smiling, because finally, finally, finally.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey\u2019re still holding hands a couple minutes later when Buffy yawns, closing her eyes. \u201cYou hungry? Up for an almost midnight snack?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAlways,\u201d Jonah Beck says, and pulls her out the door, swinging hands and laughing in the dark.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\tCyrus thinks he understands now what it means to be glowing. He and TJ are still sitting in the closet, talking about who knows what. He keeps looking at TJ\u2019s smile, and thinking: he\u2019s part of the reason for that smile. And then Cyrus smiles, and TJ laughs, and they both glow.\u00a0</p><p>\tEventually, TJ tilts his head to the side and asks, \u201cWanna get some food? PB and J didn\u2019t exactly cut it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMuffins?\u201d Cyrus says hopefully.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChocolate chocolate chip!\u201d TJ shouts, then laughs. Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you think they make lemon-flavored muffins?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ drops Cyrus\u2019s hand and gapes at him. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not! They would be good!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLemons are sour!\u201d TJ insists.\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus can\u2019t resist it. \u201cLike you?\u201d</p><p>\tTJ just shakes his head. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m sweet\u2014wait no, <i>you\u2019re</i> sweet.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s sappy.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cSo are you!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMuffins it is!\u201d Cyrus declares, and grabs TJ\u2019s hand. They scramble into the hallway, then TJ, grinning wickedly, presses his back to the wall.</p><p>\t\u201cGot to be stealthy,\u201d he whispers, and shuffles quietly to where the wall ends, dragging Cyrus with him.</p><p>\t\u201cWait\u2014what about everyone else?\u201d Cyrus says nodding towards the corner. TJ puts his ear to the wall, biting his lip as he listens. Then he shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThere\u2019s no one there.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cHuh. Weird.\u201d Cyrus shrugs and follows TJ into the living room, where, sure enough: no one is there. The strings of light twinkle, alone, in the empty room. A few cookies sit forgotten on a tray thrown to the side, and the couch\u2019s pillows are scattered across the ground.</p><p>\t\u201cWhere do you think they went?\u201d TJ asks.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know. We might have just ended the spin the bottle game, considering we broke the rules.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cDid we?\u201d TJ asks, eyebrows raised. \u201cOr did we just make it more interesting?\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cWe were in that closet for more than seven minutes,\u201d Cyrus says, \u201cbut I see your point.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cPersonally, my money is on Jonah and your girl ending up together,\u201d TJ says. \u201cJust an inkling.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBuffy?\u201d Cyrus asks, already laughing.</p><p>\t\u201cNo\u2014Andi. Of course Buffy. Did you see their flirting earlier?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYup. I\u2019ve got eyes. I believe it. Now onto the muffins!\u201d Cyrus pulls TJ into the little basement kitchen, only to see:<br>\n\tJonah looking guiltily over at them, with his free hand dipping a cracker into a peanut butter jar, and his other hand clutching Buffy\u2019s. Buffy, on the other hand, raises her eyebrows at the two of them, a challenge, and Cyrus can see the cookie crumbs on her lips.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFuck,\u201d TJ says, but he\u2019s grinning.\u00a0</p><p>\tThen he whispers, \u201cI told you so,\u201d to Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhile Jonah slowly takes the cracker out of the jar and puts it into his mouth, it occurs to Cyrus that he and TJ are also holding hands.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d Buffy says, like it\u2019s in a dream. She looks down at TJ and Cyrus\u2019s hands, eyes dancing with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d Cyrus says back.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe lost Andi and Amber,\u201d Jonah says, nodding, and exchanges a look with Buffy. Cyrus bites his lip, grinning, and thinking: maybe, all his friends get to be happy tonight. TJ, though, looks lost. Cyrus figures he\u2019ll get it soon.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was the rest of spin the bottle?\u201d Cyrus asks.</p><p>\tBuffy chokes on the cup of water she\u2019s drinking. \u201cIt was\u2026 interesting.\u201d Jonah gives her a little shove, and Cyrus\u2019s eyes go to their intertwined hands.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d TJ says, \u201cthat\u2019s all great. But we need muffins.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBe my guest,\u201d Jonah says, gesturing to the fridge. TJ squints at him.</p><p>\t\u201cThis is my house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd I\u2019m eternally grateful for\u2014ah\u2014\u201c Buffy shoves Jonah, and he looks back over at TJ. \u201cSorry. The muffins are in the fridge. We haven\u2019t touched them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ just tilts his head to the side in that TJ way and reaches past them to take the muffins from the fridge. Buffy bumps Cyrus, who has been pulled along, and mouths a scream of happiness. It comes across like a keyboard smash, and Cyrus smiles back to convey the same emotion for her. They\u2019ve both finally made reality what they\u2019ve wanted for so long.</p><p>\tOnce TJ grabs the muffins, he glances one more time over at Jonah. Cyrus considers two pieces of information in his head: TJ and Jonah have been fighting for years. Cyrus used to be head over heels for Jonah.</p><p>\tThe second feeling is long gone, though, and, with these two boys in front of him, Cyrus hopes the first is beginning to dissolve as well. Jonah is still important to him, and he doesn\u2019t want TJ and Jonah\u2019s fighting to ever cause problems. Now, in the way Jonah looks at TJ, like he\u2019s full of regret, Cyrus thinks the schism might be almost healed. He knows, though, that it\u2019s not his battle to fight. It\u2019s theirs.</p><p>\t\u201cHave fun!\u201d TJ says brightly, and Cyrus waves behind his shoulder as the two of them run up the stairs. Buffy waves back, smiling kindly, and Jonah just looks on.\u00a0</p><p>\tOnce they\u2019re up the basement stairs and running toward the main staircase, the adrenaline kicks in. Cyrus starts laughing, and then so does TJ, and they somehow make it to TJ\u2019s room before they collapse. TJ falls back on his bed, and Cyrus sprawls on the floor, next to the muffins.</p><p>\t\u201cNo lemon,\u201d Cyrus says, as he looks through the flavors.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChocolate?\u201d TJ asks, rolling over onto his stomach, and looking down at the plastic container.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThe very same flavor from the first day we met,\u201d Cyrus affirms, and tosses the wrapped chocolate muffin up to TJ. Somehow, TJ\u2019s athletic ability makes up for Cyrus\u2019s horrible throw, and he catches it.</p><p>\t\u201cRemember that?\u201d TJ says, unwrapping the muffin and already starting to split it.</p><p>\t\u201cI do,\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTastes good,\u201d TJ announces, with a mouth full of chocolate.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot as good as lemon!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cStop it with the lemon,\u201d TJ protests, reaching for a pillow to toss down at him.</p><p>\t\u201cThe Kippen household pillows are really being abused today.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tTJ shrugs, and hands him the other half of the muffin. \u201cMy parents won\u2019t mind. As long as Amber and I clean up.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLeave the lights and decorations up, though. They\u2019re pretty,\u201d Cyrus says.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah I think I will. To preserve the memory, you know?\u201d TJ says. He jumps off the bed, shuffles around in his closet, and pulls out two sleeping bags. His eyebrows raise, like a question.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTired already, TJ-no-middle-name-Kippen?\u201d Cyrus says, dubious.</p><p>\t\u201cThe J is my middle name, and this is a <i>sleep</i>over. Sleep.\u201d TJ lays out the sleeping bags beside each other, lays back on one of them, and pats the other. Cyrus slips down beside him and scoots closer, sighing. He remembers, then, something he wants to ask about.\u00a0</p><p>\tTurning on his side to face him, he meets TJ\u2019s eyes. \u201cHey TJ, when you said you had your first kiss already, um\u2014\u201c<br>\n\tTJ interrupts him, sensing the awkwardness. \u201cYeah. It was with Reed last year.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting, but it wasn\u2019t this. He feels his eyebrows go to his forehead. \u201cMiddle school watermelon Reed?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah. Um. It was at a party, and I wasn\u2019t exactly in the best state of mind. It was once.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tCyrus nods, processing. \u201cWow. Interesting first kiss story.\u201d<br>\n\t\u201cYeah, well. This is the first one that mattered.\u201d TJ smiles, and a piece of blond hair tracks down in front of his eyes. Cyrus can\u2019t even think anymore, because <i>TJ Kippen</i> just said that about their kiss and he\u2019s right here and he\u2019s smiling and\u2014</p><p>\t<i>Yeah, </i>Cyrus thinks,<i> the thing about Reed doesn\u2019t matter at all.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>They curl up in the sleeping bags, trying to be warm from TJ\u2019s fan and the waves of cold coming from the window. And they talk and talk and talk. Cyrus thinks: <i>perfect perfect perfect </i>until his mind overloads and is, for once, quiet.</p><p>\tQuiet until, strangely like a horror movie, someone bangs on the door.</p><p>\tTJ sits up, rubbing his eyes, and frowns over at Cyrus.</p><p>\t\u201cGet up, lovebirds!\u201d It\u2019s Andi\u2019s voice. Then Amber knocks down the door, possibly with a kick, and runs over to them.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus says, like he just woke up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNope! We\u2019re sleeping downstairs. Bring the sleeping bags,\u201d Amber announces, reaching out a hand for TJ. He takes it and reluctantly stands up, looking between Andi and his sister.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re glowing. What\u2019s going on?\u201d <i>Glowing.</i> Cyrus hopes, for Andi\u2019s sake, it means what he thinks it means.</p><p>\t\u201cI never kiss and tell,\u201d Amber says, with narrowed eyes and a tiny grin. Andi doubles over coughing, stands up, and shoves Amber to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d TJ gapes at the two of them. Cyrus only stands up, shrugs, and gives TJ a look that says: <i>you\u2019ll figure it out someday.\u00a0</i></p><p>\t\u201cThey grow up so fast,\u201d Andi says, smiling at Cyrus and TJ. When Cyrus frowns, Andi shrugs. \u201cWe did say we were your mothers earlier.\u201d Laughing, Cyrus gathers up the sleeping bags and throws one of them into TJ\u2019s arms.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s go, people!\u201d Amber shouts, laughing, and the four of them race and tumble down the stairs toward the basement. Andi nearly trips on the fourth step down, but TJ catches her, then pushes her back to her feet with a flourish. Cyrus tosses his sleeping back to the ground below and Amber jumps on top of it, sticks the landing, tosses her hair, and looks back up at them.</p><p>\t\u201cJonah! Buffy!\u201d Andi shouts. In a split second, the pair appears around the corner, looking only slightly guilty.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cGrab some pillows,\u201d Amber directs Buffy. \u201cTJ, run up to mom\u2019s room and pull down some blankets and comforters. Jonah, you go too,\u201d she orders, a mirror of earlier.\u00a0</p><p>\tAndi, Amber, and Cyrus go about clearing the space around the couch, and Amber drags the coffee table off to the side. Once the other four return, chaos fills the room, as sleeping bags and pillows are laid on the ground, and other pillow walls are thrown up:<br>\n\t\u201cUse the ottoman\u2014\u201c<br>\n\t\u201cNo, not that one, it\u2019s too comfortable to be a ceiling\u2014\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cOne, two, three\u2026 six pillows, okay good\u2014\u201c<br>\n\t\u201cTJ! Stop flirting with Cyrus!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh! Throw some fairy lights over the top. And turn off the rest in the room.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat last comment is Amber, and as her vision takes shape, she holds onto Andi. The pillow fort is decidedly big enough for six people, and though it may collapse sometime during the night, no one seems to care.</p><p>\t\u201cWe do make a good team,\u201d Cyrus decides, looking over their creation. \u201cAll six of us.\u201d</p><p>\tAcross the room, Andi thinks about how three years ago, this sleepover would have been a fever dream. She clutches to the memory of an hour ago, when she and Amber whispered words they each never though they could say aloud to each other. She thinks about every single complex relationship in this room: couples and crushes and ex-crushes and best friends and tentative rivals and mending friendships and twins. She thinks about how they all made it here, today.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey all collapse into the fort together, on knees and elbows and backs. Jonah clicks on the last string of lights, giving them dim brightness to see by.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTruth or dare?\u201d Amber whispers, and someone throws a pillow at her.</p><p>\t\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Cyrus says quietly, cuddled up somewhere in the middle of TJ and Buffy. He thanks silently in his mind\u2014of all people\u2014Amber, for organizing this, so they can all breathe and share and confess in the same space together. A chorus of goodnights echoes back to him: his friends. His <i>friends</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\tOutside, the snow hasn\u2019t stopped, and it piles down across streets and sidewalks and front yards. While the Kippen house\u2014eventually\u2014sleeps, lights twinkle in the sky, and the night goes on.\u00a0</p><p><b>END PART 2</b></p>",

His mouth falls agape, though, as he stares at Amber.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Spin the <i>bottle</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tAndi leans a little more on Amber, laughs nervously, then laughs with more certainty. &ldquo;No, spin the baby tater. Of course spin the bottle!&rdquo; Cyrus gives her a worried look, putting a noticeable space between himself and TJ, who runs to the lights and flicks them back on.</p><p>\tBuffy offers no comment, just taps Jonah&rsquo;s shoulder so she&rsquo;ll let him down. Then she accidentally bumps shoulders with him as they stumble over to the couch and sit down next to each other. Jonah feels the nerves on his skin stand up at the wisp of contact: a quiet shock.</p><p>\tStill stepping around fairy lights, Andi whispers something furtively to Amber, who bites her lip and shrugs. Then, regaining her composure, she smiles and runs back over to the couch.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Who has a bottle? A water bottle&mdash;uh, Buffy? You&rsquo;re a runner.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tBuffy raises her eyebrows but pulls a water bottle from seemingly out of nowhere with no visible reluctance. It&rsquo;s silvery and dented and clearly not meant for playing spin the bottle in basements, but then again they&rsquo;re not exactly meant for this either. Jonah glances around the room, and tallies: TJ has never dated anyone, Cyrus and TJ probably like each other, Buffy hasn&rsquo;t dated anyone except Marty, Amber doesn&rsquo;t seem to date anymore, as a rule, Andi had Walker and Jonah and then no one else every again, and Jonah&mdash;</p><p>\tIt occurs to Jonah that he&rsquo;s dated the most people out of everyone in this room. And that he&rsquo;s kissed not one, but three girls.</p><p>\tIt also occurs to him that the first and only girl who has made him understand the expression <i>butterflies in your stomach</i> is sitting in this room. Next to him. Holding a bottle.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; Amber shouts, snatching the bottle from Buffy and depositing it on the coffee table in front of the couch. Cyrus hastily picks up the remnants of the cinnamon cookies, glancing at TJ, then chucks them in the corner. Neither of the Kippens comment, and Amber continues speaking. &ldquo;So&hellip;.&rdquo; she sighs. &ldquo;We should probably not do the lips, considering only, what&mdash;two?&mdash;of the people in this room have had their first kiss?&rdquo;</p><p>\tEyes flash to Jonah, and to Andi. Jonah feels Buffy watching him from his left, but he doesn&rsquo;t react. He meets Andi&rsquo;s eyes across the couch, who is grinning sheepishly. They&rsquo;ve talked about it&mdash;awkwardly&mdash;before: how they&rsquo;re first kiss was in middle school, and strangely spontaneous, and in plain view of several other people.&nbsp;</p><p>\tJonah remembers another kiss&mdash;then winces at the memory. It was his last kiss with Kira, under fluorescent roller skating lights. Two weeks later Jonah&rsquo;s stray physics homework and skateboard stickers had been evicted from Kira&rsquo;s house, and Jonah was no longer welcome at the Jefferson high school girls basketball games. Buffy had consoled him, which had always felt like a big thing: Buffy choosing Jonah over Kira. But maybe she wasn&rsquo;t, because Kira and Buffy still kept their tentative, basketball-centric, passive-aggressive friendship around.&nbsp;</p><p>\tMaybe it didn&rsquo;t matter. Jonah wanted his slate to be wiped clean. He wanted to be like Amber or Cyrus tonight, never having kissed someone and still dying to find out. He wanted&mdash;</p><p>\tLike a pesky firefly, a thought pricked at his mind: he wanted Buffy to have been his first.</p><p>\tBut this is what he gets, tonight. Buffy leans a little into him, still shaping a smile at Andi: her best friend. Then, finally, she speaks:</p><p>\t&ldquo;If two people spin each other twice, seven minutes in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tAmber lets out a scream of excitement, twisting in her seat. &ldquo;Perfect&mdash;wait, one more thing.&rdquo; She jumps from the couch and hurries back to the light switch, flipping it and leaving the room in suspended darkness, pinpointed with various strings of light. There&rsquo;s enough light to see the faces of each person sitting around the couch, in this order: Jonah, Buffy, Amber, Andi, Cyrus, TJ.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I better not spin you, Driscoll,&rdquo; TJ says jokingly, in a way that says he asking for forgiveness, for the tenth or twentieth or fiftieth time. Part of Jonah wants TJ to say something to him with the same look in his eyes, because Jonah is sick and tired of wanting move on from middle school things&mdash;it&rsquo;s why he went with TJ to get the decorations, it&rsquo;s why he likes to spend time around Buffy and TJ together: because they&rsquo;re all forgiving each other, in their own ways, for what happened months and years ago.</p><p>\tJonah knows, also, that part of the reconciliation is on his shoulders. And that it&rsquo;s not a thing for here, tonight.</p><p>\tBuffy scoffs at TJ&rsquo;s remark, but Jonah sees that she&rsquo;s smiling.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;If I spin Jonah, we have to remake the moment in the Red Rooster,&rdquo; Andi says, and Jonah blinks in surprise.</p><p>\t&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll have to do it awkwardly with everyone watching?&rdquo;</p><p>\tAndi chucks a pillow at him, and Jonah lets out a breath like a laugh. He&rsquo;s glad, then, that they can joke like this.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Amber says, with a realization, &ldquo;three people in this room have had their first kiss.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; Cyrus interrupts, frowning. &ldquo;I had&mdash;I mean, Iris kissed me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tTJ shifts in his seat.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Buffy says, sitting up from her laid back position. &ldquo;Raise your hand if you&rsquo;ve had your first kiss.</p><p>\tJonah and Andi are the first to place their hands in the air. Then Cyrus, following his prior statement. Then&mdash;TJ?</p><p>\tBuffy and Amber are left with their hands down and mouths working. But Jonah looks over at TJ, thinking about how he&rsquo;s never had a girlfriend. Never had a boyfriend, either.</p><p>\t&ldquo;TJ?&rdquo; Andi says, as if reading Jonah&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>\tHe shrugs and leans back. Amber glances over at&mdash;Jonah, of all people, but then shakes her head.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay, well, we&rsquo;re still not doing lips. Not unless you both want to.&rdquo;</p><p>\tCyrus nods in assent, and it&rsquo;s decided.&nbsp;</p><p>\tJonah is so close to Buffy. And he&rsquo;s holding his breath. He doesn&rsquo;t know if he wants her to spin him or not, him to spin her or not, for the two of them to end up facing each other in a Kippen closet. Because Jonah doesn&rsquo;t want to also have to face an awful truth that might exist: that Buffy would never, ever like him.</p><p>\tBuffy bumps his shoulder, and he bumps back, heartbeat fluttering. There&rsquo;s cookies and lights and singing, and then there is Buffy&rsquo;s shoulder brushing his. Two different planes of existence.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spin first!&rdquo; Andi calls out, breaking the silence. Jonah sees the last glance she gives Amber, ripe with something in the curve of her eyebrows and quirk of her mouth. Then she steps to the bottle, grips the neck, and spins it around and around and around and&mdash;</p><p>\tWhen it stops, it&rsquo;s pointing directly at him.</p><p>&mdash;&nbsp;</p><p>\tBuffy watches her best friend spin the boy sitting next to her, and she manages to maintain her calm. Andi and Jonah&mdash;old news. Jonah hitches a breath, shakes his head, then leans over and lets Andi peck his cheek. It&rsquo;s too much like the first Red Rooster kiss, feeling anticlimactic yet so exposed. When Jonah sits back, he doesn&rsquo;t look at Buffy.</p><p>\tBuffy, who doesn&rsquo;t blush, as a rule, can feel her face turning red.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay, then. Next?&rdquo; Amber says, nodding in Jonah&rsquo;s direction. Buffy eyes the bottle intently, as he tips it around in a circle. She wonders, for a moment, if Andi and Jonah would kiss in the closet if he spun it back around to Andi.&nbsp;</p><p>\tCommon sense, for once, cuts into her mind and reminds her of a simple fact: Andi is head over heels for Amber. Jonah is&mdash;</p><p>\tWell, Jonah is a question mark.</p><p>\tIn the split second while Buffy considers all of this, the bottle swings nearly 360 degrees and lands, with no hesitation, facing her.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Lovebirds!&rdquo; TJ calls out, but Buffy doesn&rsquo;t hear him. Her heart is beating too fast.</p><p>\tJonah, who looks only slightly ruffled, leans in, and, quick as a feather or a snowflake, dusts her cheek with a kiss. It takes Buffy longer than half a second to jerk away at the unexpectedness. Then, because she&rsquo;s tired of being ashamed, she turns to meet Jonah&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Next time, warn me before you lean in, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t<i>Next time</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBuffy doesn&rsquo;t know why she says it, except she definitely knows why she says it.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Whatever you say, Slayer,&rdquo; Jonah says, a beat too late, and nudges her shoulder.</p><p>\tIt feels like a moment. It feels like something.</p><p>\tWhile Amber pushes the bottle over toward her, Buffy replays several things in her head all at once:<br /><i>One:</i> the day she met Jonah Beck. It was before Andi and the Good Hair Crew all latched onto him. It was before frisbee lessons with Bex and bracelets and all of that. Buffy had been walking home from Jefferson, crossing the fields where the Space Otters were practicing. A younger version of the Jonah next to her now had thrown a frisbee at her feet, eyebrows enticing. Sharp and suspicious and so very Buffy-like, she had picked it up and turned it over in her hands. Jonah finally reached out to take it, and she pulled it back, then threw it over his head to the girl behind him, who caught it squarely in her hands. &ldquo;Jonah,&rdquo; he said, then, and she nodded. It wasn&rsquo;t until Andi introduced them later, and their paths crossed truly, that she lent him back her name. And it wasn&rsquo;t until months later, when the trust was real between them, that she gave her name to him, to have and share and keep as friends.</p><p>\t<i>Two: </i>the day Marty almost kissed her. It was like clockwork at that point: Buffy flopped down on the futon in Marty&rsquo;s room, unlaced her running shoes, and started on her physics homework. Marty spun around in his chair, tapping a pen against his chin, and attempted math homework while actually looking up runners on <i>milesplit.com</i>. It had been a Tuesday, that much she remembered. She asked Marty to come help her with something, and he trailed over, with tired eyes. They were sitting next to her, and Buffy felt something like a warm energy swelling inside her. She had <i>liked </i>Marty: ferociously, confidently, after their middle school falling out, for almost all of ninth grade. She couldn&rsquo;t deny it, any more than she could deny the way her heartbeat skipped when Jonah&rsquo;s kissed her cheek. But back then&mdash;she wasn&rsquo;t ready, even then, to kiss anyone. It was hard to know if she ever would be&mdash;sure, kisses on cheek and holding hands and arms around each other were all wonderful. But a kiss, on the lips? When Marty leaned in, Buffy&rsquo;s heart skipped, but not in a good way. She felt something essential break between them, just as she had two years earlier when Marty left her on the bridge. And it couldn&rsquo;t be the same again, and it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>\t<i>Three</i>: the feeling in her stomach moments ago when Jonah pecked her on the cheek. Bumped her arm. Carried her on his shoulders so she could throw glittery pieces of paper at the ceiling. Days ago, ate baby taters in the booth across from her. She doesn&rsquo;t need to explain it any more; it&rsquo;s there.</p><p>\tIt&rsquo;s there, and he bumped her shoulder.</p><p>\tBuffy spins the bottle, and, because the world is just <i>like that</i>, it lands on the person sitting nearly directly across from her: TJ Kippen.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rules of the game,&rdquo; Andi says, holding back a laugh.</p><p>\t&ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;m going to kiss TJ Kippen,&rdquo; Buffy announces, standing up in her seat, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;ve got&mdash;ah&mdash;&ldquo;<br />\n\tBuffy stops when TJ himself gets up, runs over, jumps on the couch, and pecks her on the cheek, all in about two seconds, looking annoyingly pleased with himself. TJ shakes his head once he does it, and Buffy gags, fake retching over the side of the couch. She doesn&rsquo;t look down at Jonah&rsquo;s face&mdash;she&rsquo;s not sure she wants to see it.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Gross!&rdquo; she yells at TJ&rsquo;s retreating figure, back over to Cyrus, who gives him a tentative high five.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not as gross as you!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who <i>kissed </i>me!&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;Well were you going to do it?&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Settle down,&rdquo; Amber says, grinning. She glances at Andi; so much of their conversation seems to be in exchanges like that, small looks and knowing eyes. Buffy notices; how could she not?</p><p>\t&ldquo;Nope. I need to go wash my mouth out,&rdquo; Buffy insists, hopping off the couch.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even&mdash;&ldquo; TJ protests. Buffy throws him a look, and runs off to the sink.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>\tThe tint of pinpoint lights and the sparkle of the snow outside the window are starting to hurt Cyrus&rsquo;s eyes. Otherwise in the dark, he&rsquo;s snuggled in the couch next to TJ, neither of them saying much. He keeps replaying the moment in his head, over and over: a pinky linked to his, two palms against each other, fingers interlocked. He keeps going back to how TJ was the one who curled his pinky over Cyrus&rsquo;s, how TJ was the one whose heartbeat he felt beating in sync with his in the contact of their wrists.</p><p>\tNow, they sit only inches apart, but their hands are separate.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe wishes he could know what TJ is thinking right now. He wishes he knew what <i>he </i>is thinking right now. Feelings, Cyrus has learned, are difficult.</p><p>\tActually, difficult is a poor way to put it. It&rsquo;s something more than difficult to know someone for three years, to know them <i>well</i> for two, and to have feelings for approximately two&mdash;maybe more, maybe less. It&rsquo;s impossible, almost, to hang out and sleepover and talk and text for hours and <i>hold hands </i>with the boy he&rsquo;s so desperately enamored with, and to never say the words out loud. To Buffy and Andi, who spill back about their crushes (well, Buffy doesn&rsquo;t, but Cyrus figures she&rsquo;s figuring out how to manage the past with Marty and the future with Jonah), to them it&rsquo;s easy. But he doesn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;ll ever say it out loud to TJ. Or if he ever wants to.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Earth to Cyrus!&rdquo; Andi says, and he&rsquo;s back in the land of the living. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been spun.&rdquo;<br />\n\tCyrus nods, sleepily, then glances down at the bottle. Pointing at him, accusingly. He glances up, counts off in his head what&rsquo;s occurred so far. Then&mdash;</p><p>\t<i>Crap.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>TJ Kippen is looking over at him, uneasily. Everyone else is smiling at them, but Cyrus can&rsquo;t see them. He sees TJ, who doesn&rsquo;t seem to know what to do. It feels like he&rsquo;s nervous, which can&rsquo;t possibly be true&mdash;he just kissed Buffy Driscoll with apparently no regard for his own life. But he&rsquo;s hesitating now.</p><p>\tEvery time something happens that might just means TJ could possibly like him, Cyrus feels his heart smiling inside.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; someone whispers across the circle. And so TJ does, and Cyrus&rsquo;s shoulders bristle and his mind goes blank and his stomach fills with violently present butterflies and TJ kisses him about two inches from his lips.</p><p>\tAnd Cyrus, who was trying to maintain calm, feels a supernova explode from that point. A small one, but a supernova nonetheless. It&rsquo;s the sting of the nerves and the warmth of his skin that reminds him (as if he didn&rsquo;t know already) that this is something he likes, that this boy in front of him is cute and attractive and magnetic.&nbsp;</p><p>\tCyrus is the one to pull away, because his erratic breathing is giving him away. (In the back of his head, he thinks: <i>and that was only on the cheek</i>.) But he puts that thought away, and falls back, breathless next to TJ, who looks a little sick and a lot happy.</p><p>\tHe misses the knowing look between Andi and Buffy, as if they&rsquo;re his wingwomen, and the smile Amber gives Jonah, because all of them ship this more than anything. Cyrus misses it, because he&rsquo;s thinking about TJ.</p><p>\tHe wants to say something, but what is there to say? So he doesn&rsquo;t, just silently takes the bottle in his hand and pauses only a moment before giving it a half-hearted spin.</p><p>\tBowie Quinn, Cyrus thinks, as the bottle slows to a stop, is right about the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe cap is directed, irrefutably, toward the only one in the room Cyrus was afraid he would spin.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Closet!&rdquo; Buffy yells, and Cyrus thinks of the irony of it.&nbsp;</p><p>\tEverything&rsquo;s almost like a dream: the fairy lights, Andi&rsquo;s encouraging smile, TJ getting to his feet and stumbling over to the closet, followed by Cyrus. Everything&rsquo;s a haze, because this is not what Cyrus thought would happen tonight&mdash;just the two of them, alone in a closet. A closet!<br />\n\tCyrus nearly doesn&rsquo;t make it the door. It&rsquo;s not an overstatement to say his vision might be a little blurry. Or maybe that&rsquo;s the dark.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen they both go in the closet and shut the door, it&rsquo;s still dark.</p><p>\tCyrus doesn&rsquo;t allow himself to think it too loudly, but he&rsquo;s <i>hoping.</i></p><p><i>&mdash;</i></p><p><i>\t</i>TJ&rsquo;s mind short-circuited when he kissed Cyrus&rsquo;s cheek. TJ&rsquo;s mind short-circuited on his math final only days ago. TJ&rsquo;s mind stopped functioning for a moment when the Jefferson girls&rsquo; basketball team won the championship last year, and Buffy Driscoll actually gave his broken-ACL-crutches self a <i>hug</i>.</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s thanking his lucky stars that somehow, his mind is working right now.</p><p>\tCyrus&rsquo;s cheeks are still a little red, and TJ knows his are too, especially after the second spin. They walk to the closet, around the corner and out of sight of the rest of everyone.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re the lucky ones, huh?&rdquo; TJ says, holding the closet door open for Cyrus, who nods but doesn&rsquo;t say anything in return. Once the door swings shut, they&rsquo;re left in utter darkness. TJ swears softly and fumbles around the walls, searching for the switch. It&rsquo;s his house&mdash;he really should know where the closet light is. But it&rsquo;s Cyrus who finds it, tugging on a string suspended from the ceiling and gazing over at TJ with dark eyes.</p><p>\tTJ wants, and he wants, and he wants. He wants with his eyes open and shut and when Cyrus looks over at him he almost kisses him then and there.</p><p>\tBut the two of them settle across from each other in the crowded closet, on opposite sides. TJ picks a spot on the wall just above Cyrus to rest his eyes.</p><p>\tSilence flickers for a moment before Cyrus shuffles and crosses the room to stand next to him. Cyrus, ever the brave one, always the strong one. TJ is so proud; there&rsquo;s not a drop of jealousy left in him. There used to be, back in middle school, when Cyrus had both Buffy and Andi and TJ had no one except maybe Reed. But it&rsquo;s all gone.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe light above them blinks, and in the space between darkness and light, TJ&rsquo;s hand ends up pressed against Cyrus&rsquo;s. He doesn&rsquo;t know how it happens, but it does. Like earlier, their hands intertwine, pressed together, and pull their sides against each other. TJ feels his breathing go shallow. When was the moment that Cyrus could first make him breathless? Maybe at the swings that second time. Maybe when he went to Cyrus&rsquo;s house and they sat, inches apart, watching made-for-tv movies last winter. Maybe every time they almost held hands, and the twice now that they truly have. And still are.</p><p>\tMinutes stack on top of each other and pile up, and TJ begins to realize he may be running out of time. For what? He can&rsquo;t exactly shape his intentions in his mind. But he knows.</p><p>\tAfter what seems like an eternity, Cyrus&rsquo;s hand twitches in his, and TJ decides he can&rsquo;t keep waiting, just like when he first pushed his hand into Cyrus&rsquo;s. He swings around, looking over at Cyrus, who looks back, almost afraid.</p><p>\tTheir faces are nearly touching, illuminated in the dusty closet light and opposites in a photographic negative.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus says, so delicately, like he could break the word with too much force. TJ&rsquo;s heart is flickering, fluttering, existing. &ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you want to do seven minutes in heaven?&rdquo;</p><p>\tTJ sees the question break his face, sees Cyrus begin to ask himself why he said it. But TJ, again, sees the bravery splayed across his nervous mouth and endless eyes. His heartbeat hammers in his chest; it wants out.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe squeezes Cyrus&rsquo;s hand, and it&rsquo;s warm. &ldquo;Only with you.&rdquo;</p><p>\tIt feels like the bravest thing he&rsquo;s ever said.</p><p>\tIt feels like the heartbeat in Cyrus&rsquo;s wrist is screaming against his.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt feels like something he was missing is almost, almost there.</p><p>\tHe sees Cyrus smile, and he sees the hand in his move upwards as the body attached to it shifts towards him. Instinctively, he closes his eyes.</p><p>\tIt&rsquo;s Cyrus who pulled him out of the dark, when his parents and his friends and the awfulness inside him were drowning him and he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. It&rsquo;s Cyrus who listened, who <i>listened</i> and was there for him always and ever. It&rsquo;s Cyrus who held him while he choked on tears in ninth grade, having discovered his knee no longer wanted to function as a knee for nine months. It&rsquo;s Cyrus who knows the stories of his parents and his grandparents and his sister and his loneliness. It&rsquo;s Cyrus who reached out and took that loneliness from him. It&rsquo;s Cyrus who matters. And it&rsquo;s Cyrus, then, who pushes the last few inches&mdash;they&rsquo;re so<i> close</i>&mdash;and breathes into reality what was meant to be all this time.</p><p>\tIt&rsquo;s Cyrus who grips TJ&rsquo;s hand and kisses him, sweet and simple, all at once.</p><p>\tIn less than a second, Cyrus pulls back, and he&rsquo;s still close enough that TJ can feel his measured breath and taste the anxiousness. His brows are drawn together, dark eyes worried, as if he&rsquo;s made a mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>\tTJ wants that look gone from Cyrus&rsquo;s face.</p><p>\tHe lets go of Cyrus&rsquo;s hand and wraps his arms around him, embracing him tightly as Cyrus finally relaxes. He holds him, he holds him, he holds him, like the world is new and this is all he knows. He holds Cyrus like it&rsquo;s been three years in the making, because it has.</p><p>\tCyrus is crying, crying and breathing: exhaling, finally. And eventually TJ pulls back from the embrace, only because he has something else he needs to do. Cyrus rubs his eyes, still gazing up at TJ, waiting for one of them to say something.</p><p>\tTJ doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say, now. But he crosses the distance between them once again, because he needs to, because he wants to. And this time, when they kiss, no one pulls away.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt&rsquo;s muffins and it&rsquo;s swings and it&rsquo;s somersaults and it&rsquo;s hidden smiles and it&rsquo;s long phone calls and it&rsquo;s happiness, happiness, happiness.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>\tAmber is still laughing, watching TJ and Cyrus follow each other, mesmerized, into the closet. But everyone else looks on in wonder and maybe jealousy, wishing for <i>something.</i> Amber wants <i>something</i> too, but she doesn&rsquo;t want to allow herself to think about it.</p><p>\t&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Andi asks finally. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no one&rsquo;s turn.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You can spin,&rdquo; Amber interrupts, running a hand through her hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just assume we won&rsquo;t get either of them out of there for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Should we set a timer, though?&rdquo; Jonah asks, already reaching for his phone. Amber shrugs and so Jonah sets it anyway, the seconds ticking away.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAndi picks up the bottle, tosses it around in her hands a few times, much to Buffy&rsquo;s chagrin. Then she drops it on the table, spinning it quickly and delicately. Amber watches Andi&rsquo;s hands tip the bottle, almost like she&rsquo;s piecing together the parts of a puzzle or a craft. And she watches Andi&rsquo;s spin push the bottle around seven times until it ends up, somehow unsurprisingly, pointing at Amber.</p><p>\tAmber has come to expect this. She thinks of their moment in the kitchen, hours ago, and wonders if Andi will even remember it tomorrow. She thinks about how Andi kissed Jonah so easily. She lets her own insecurity wash over her, because it&rsquo;s almost easier than thinking the possibility she hopes for could be true.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Pucker up,&rdquo; Andi says jokingly, and Amber considers how bold Andi has become in the past year. Part of Amber thinks it&rsquo;s her own fault (not that she minds the change).&nbsp;</p><p>\tAndi leans over, grinning, and kisses Amber on the cheek. It lasts half a second longer than the rest of the kisses, but it&rsquo;s hard for Amber to think anything of it. Not when Andi does it so casually, and flourishes her movements after the fact, grinning. It&rsquo;s even harder for Amber to imagine that Andi could kiss someone she had romantic feelings for like it&rsquo;s nothing.</p><p>\tAnd Amber has seen this before: it&rsquo;s the air that gay girls breathe. Friendships so deep they might as well be romances, but to one half of the pairing, they could never be. Texting late into the night, sharing anything and everything, even holding hands. Amber doesn&rsquo;t want that to be what&rsquo;s between her and Andi; she really, desperately doesn&rsquo;t. But she thinks of the unspoken jokes between them, of text threads that extend into tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnd she takes the bottle, not wanting to let herself keep thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey Amber,&rdquo; Buffy says suddenly. &ldquo;Remember when Cyrus forced us to have a therapy session to reconcile?&rdquo;</p><p>\tAmber winces, because memories of that come with memories of things she and Andi have already put behind them: ferris wheels and marker hearts and hatred.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, I remember. We hated each other,&rdquo; she responds carefully. Beside her, Andi studies the couch, contemplating.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Buffy says, all too suddenly again. &ldquo;For hating you for no reason.&rdquo;</p><p>\tIt&rsquo;s the strangest apology, out of place and in the wrong time. They&rsquo;ve made up dozens of times before, or they wouldn&rsquo;t be here, in the same house, about to have a sleepover.</p><p>\tAnd yet.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Amber says, softer than she&rsquo;s ever said most anything. &ldquo;I was awful, and I should&rsquo;ve been better.&rdquo;</p><p>\tAndi is looking directly at Jonah, unable to take a side in this. So Amber keeps her gaze locked on Buffy&rsquo;s, who looks&mdash;gentler. More open.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I just wanted to say it,&rdquo; Buffy says, &ldquo;so we can finally, finally move on.&rdquo;</p><p>\tAmber smiles, then. &ldquo;Look at us. Cyrus had to bring us in for relationship therapy and now we&rsquo;re all helping him and TJ&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hang out,&rdquo; Jonah cuts in, with a grin. Amber imagines if her brother were here, the reconciliation might finally be complete: Buffy and TJ, TJ and Jonah, Jonah and Amber, Amber and Buffy. But TJ&rsquo;s not here, and that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s enough to know that Andi&rsquo;s best friend&mdash;that <i>Buffy</i>&mdash;forgives her. That she wants to move on.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Time to spin the bottle?&rdquo; Buffy asks, hopefully. Amber is struck, suddenly, with how the spiky outer shell of middle-school Buffy has softened into kindness and strength.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You got it.&rdquo; Amber drops the bottle in the middle and spins it. And spins it and spins it until:</p><p>\t&ldquo;I guess we really are throwing it back,&rdquo; Andi laughs, the first word she&rsquo;s spoken in a few minutes. The bottle declares her destiny, with no regrets: Jonah Beck.</p><p>\tJonah Beck: the only boy to ever catch Amber Kippen&rsquo;s eye. Jonah Beck: a question mark. Jonah Beck: certainly not who she wanted to be kissing tonight.</p><p>\tStill, Amber leans across Buffy to peck Jonah on the cheek. She wants it to be nothing, but she also wants it to be something final. Something Andi can see and know: the past is past. All of it.</p><p>\tAs Amber leans back, and Jonah makes no expression at all, Amber thinks about how things from so long ago still affect them today. She doesn&rsquo;t want eighth grade Amber, the one who was struggling so badly with her parents that she lashed out at everyone around her, to be the one they all remember. The one who comes to mind. And she&rsquo;s been trying to erase that version of herself for so long&mdash;over two years.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt&rsquo;s worn out and cliche, but Amber&rsquo;s so tired of being the mean girl. She wonders if apologizing to Buffy and kissing Jonah Beck is enough. She wonders if anything will ever be enough.</p><p>\t&ldquo;My turn,&rdquo; Jonah says hurriedly, cutting the silence. He spins it again, and lands on&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;Buffy.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAmber&rsquo;s suspected the both of them for long enough, and as they go off into the closet, Andi also wears a smug smile. And then it&rsquo;s just the two of them: Amber and Andi. Isn&rsquo;t it always?</p><p>\tMoments after Jonah and Buffy leave, the timer on Buffy&rsquo;s phone goes off, signifying the end of TJ and Cyrus&rsquo;s seven minutes. Andi gives Amber a look that asks: <i>are you going to go get them?</i> Amber gives her back a look that says: <i>no, are you crazy?</i> Andi deactivates the alarm in agreement. &nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;How do you think they&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; Amber asks out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Honestly? Thriving,&rdquo; Andi says. &ldquo;I hope Jonah and Buffy are too.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something unspoken there: the last two left.</p><p>\t&ldquo;And us?&rdquo; Amber asks.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Tired,&rdquo; Andi admits. &ldquo;Drained from finals. Full of peanut butter sandwiches and cinnamon cookies.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; Amber says, like it&rsquo;s a shock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about ten thirty, and you never sleep&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I never sleep,&rdquo; Andi agrees. &ldquo;But suddenly I feel like I could sleep for days. Maybe it was the snow this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mayhaps someone made too many snow angels?&rdquo; Amber asks.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mayhaps <i>someone</i> threw about a hundred snowballs at me.&rdquo;</p><p>\tAmber reaches up and swats at one of the stray strings of light above their heads. &ldquo;How long do you think the snow&rsquo;s going to last?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Bex and I have decided two days at the most. Enough time to go to the alpine slide.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;The alpine slide?? In the snow?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Just a little tradition I have with my parents. Buffy, Cyrus, and I used to go in the fall but we haven&rsquo;t since&hellip; a certain disaster.&rdquo;</p><p>\tAndi leans back on Amber&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You know, spin the bottle doesn&rsquo;t make much sense if everyone ends up in the closet at once&mdash;wait a minute, which closet did Jonah and Buffy go in? If TJ and Cyrus are in the other ones?&rdquo;</p><p>\tAmber shrugs. &ldquo;The second dimension one. They&rsquo;re actually both in the same closet at once, but in different metaphysical spaces.&rdquo;</p><p>\tTurning around to look directly at Amber, inches away from her nose, Andi narrows her eyes. &ldquo;Either you&rsquo;re on drugs or you&rsquo;re a nerd.&rdquo;<br />\n\tAmber stretches back: anything to get away from Andi&rsquo;s very present bright eyes and tiny smile. &ldquo;TJ&rsquo;s the nerd, not me.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;Drugs it is, then.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You got me,&rdquo; Amber mumbles, fading off. And then, like a scene from a dream, Andi reaches up and twirls a strand of Amber&rsquo;s hair between her fingers, eyes half-lidded.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I <i>am</i> tired,&rdquo; Andi asserts. Amber keeps holding her breath.</p><p>\t&ldquo;If you fall asleep on me, I&rsquo;ll draw a mustache on your face,&rdquo; Amber teases, and Andi stops twirling her hair, turns around and tilts her chin up so she&rsquo;s staring right at Amber.</p><p>\t&ldquo;If you draw a mustache on my face, I&rsquo;ll&hellip;&rdquo; Andi, for once, comes up short of words.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll what?&rdquo; Amber asks, smiling. If Andi can flirt like it&rsquo;s nothing, then so can she. She winks down at Andi. &ldquo;Throw snowballs at me?&rdquo;</p><p>\tAndi sighs and rolls her eyes, but she&rsquo;s grinning too. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll put snow in your sleeping bag. There.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll craft me to death?&rdquo; Amber continues, ignoring Andi&rsquo;s remark.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey! You&rsquo;ve already seen my baking skills, which include wielding a large wooden spoon. Don&rsquo;t test me.&rdquo;Andi scrambles up to sit, legs tucked beneath her, and positions herself about two inches from Amber&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;Draw the mustache, get the spoon.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;Hm. I seem to remember a very different course of events involving the spoon than you do. As in, I took yours and cornered you.&rdquo; Amber moves a centimeter closer to Andi, lets herself breathe. She can do this. She can keep up.</p><p>\t&ldquo;As in, you have the home field advantage right now. If we were at <i>my</i> apartment, I could best you in wooden spoon dueling any day.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to take you up on that offer,&rdquo; Amber says.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I guess you will. Although,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;I seriously doubt that all six of us could fit in my room to sleepover. Or even a huge pillow fort. So it would have to be just the two of us.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Would your parents even let you have boys over to sleepover?&rdquo; Amber asks. She doesn&rsquo;t know why she says it. It sounds useless in the air.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&ldquo; Andi says, then cuts off. She relaxes back against the couch, and it occurs to Amber that they never set a timer for Jonah and Buffy. But she doesn&rsquo;t want to remind Andi of that, because she&rsquo;s having too much fun now: exchanging words, laughing, being as close as possible without truly touching.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhich is why it&rsquo;s so surprising when Andi, out of nowhere, muffles a sob.</p><p>\tShe&rsquo;s still leaning back against the couch, chin pointed upward and throat exposed to the ceiling. Amber can see the beginning of tears forming in her eyes. <i>Fuck.</i> Had Amber made her cry?<br />\n\t&ldquo;Andi?&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe shakes her head and turns away, wiping the tear from her eye.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Andi?&rdquo; Amber repeats, and reaches out a hand for her friend. Her <i>friend</i>, who needs her help right now, not hopeless pining.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAndi turns around and grips Amber&rsquo;s hand in her own, breathing fast. It&rsquo;s all so sudden. Amber wants to reach out and tuck back the strand of dark hair that has fallen in front of Andi&rsquo;s eyes. But she doesn&rsquo;t. Instead, she says: &ldquo;Is this&mdash;is this about Buffy and Jonah and TJ and all of us?&rdquo;</p><p>\tOffering a sad laugh, Andi shakes her head. &ldquo;No, not at all. You guys are all making up finally&mdash;it&rsquo;s amazing. I want it to be forever.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about <i>forever&mdash;</i>&ldquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Amber, wait,&rdquo; Andi interrupts. &ldquo;I wanted to apologize to you. For&mdash;&ldquo;\t</p><p>\t&ldquo;For what? Middle school things? I&rsquo;m the one who should be apologizing; I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I am&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Andi says, and the word is full of tears. &ldquo;I want to apologize for&mdash;for&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>\tAndi cuts herself off, not once, but twice. She shakes her head, rubs her eyes, squeezes Amber&rsquo;s hand which is miraculously still holding Andi&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Andi?&rdquo; Amber says, so soft that the word could be a feather.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I have something. Something that I&rsquo;ve wanted to tell you, for so, <i>so </i>long. And it sits on the tip of my tongue every time I have a conversation, especially with you, but I bury it inside, and I just can&rsquo;t live with myself anymore because I need to tell you so <i>bad</i>, Amber. I need to. And I couldn&rsquo;t sit here and laugh and talk anymore because I need to say it like I need air to breathe.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe room, for once, is silent.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to say it,&rdquo; Andi says, so quiet Amber almost doesn&rsquo;t hear.</p><p>\tAmber waits.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>\tSeconds tick off: one, two, three. The same measure as Amber&rsquo;s heartbeats.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Amber,&rdquo; Andi whispers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bisexual.&rdquo;</p><p>\tAnd now she&rsquo;s crying. And now they&rsquo;re both crying. And now Amber can&rsquo;t see anything, can&rsquo;t think anything except this: <i>i love her i love her i love her i love her she&rsquo;s crying she&rsquo;s crying.</i></p><p>\tAnd now Amber takes Andi&rsquo;s other hand, and says: &ldquo;Andi. Andi. Andi, you are the most amazing, bravest person I know. Thank you for telling&mdash;<i>thank you</i>, Andi&mdash;I love you&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>\tAmber hugs her, and Andi stays limp for one moment, in shock, before she hugs back, and their tears mix, and she rest her exhausted eyelids on Amber&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was trying to say,&rdquo; Andi says, quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so <i>tired </i>of pretending to be someone I&rsquo;m not, only because I haven&rsquo;t said two words out loud. It feels like lying.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; Amber says back, immediately, because she knows <i>exactly</i> how Andi feels, what it means to have a piece of her that she has to show the world, or else she&rsquo;s living a lie.</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; Andi echoes, and Amber wants so badly right now to tell her that she&rsquo;s not alone. She needs to. A glance around the room tells her that the other four are still in their respective closets (fuck, that&rsquo;s symbolic), and that Buffy&rsquo;s water bottle rests, forgotten, on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Amber whispers, keeping her right hand firmly in Andi&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s&mdash;um&mdash;let&rsquo;s go upstairs.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the only way she&rsquo;ll be able to get it out, if the two of them are alone. And she wants to. She wants to so bad, to reciprocate it and be able to exhale. Andi has finally given her the bravery to do it. (And why wouldn&rsquo;t it be Andi, the first girl Amber ever truly fell for, and the strongest person Amber knows, who gave her enough strength to say the words herself?)</p><p>\tAnd so they scramble up the stairs, tears still falling and hands permanently entangled. Amber&rsquo;s room is dimly lit, with snow on the windowpanes. She flips on the lamp and falls onto the bed, holding her breath. She wants to let it out so bad.</p><p>\tAndi tumbles down next to her, eyes unseeing, probably still processing what she&rsquo;s said out loud.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Andi,&rdquo; Amber says quietly, just like she said moments earlier. Andi turns to face her.</p><p>\t<i>Just say the words. Just say them. Just do it.</i></p><p>\tA balancing, a gift, a secret. Amber wants Andi to understand she&rsquo;s not alone, she never will be, she&rsquo;s so love and loved and <i>loved.</i></p><p>\tAgain: &ldquo;Andi.&rdquo;</p><p>\tNeither of them are looking anywhere in particular now. Amber thinks: <i>she&rsquo;s so brave. </i>Amber thinks: <i>it&rsquo;s time to stop being miserable. And to start being brave.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>Then Amber stops thinking, and she speaks.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also&mdash;I mean&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m bi&mdash;I like girls, oh my god I can&rsquo;t believe I just said that. I like girls. So I&rsquo;m gay, or something. I don&rsquo;t know if I like boys, I don&rsquo;t really know, I might&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>\tAndi is crashing into her before the rambling sentence can end. The second embrace is just like the first one, only better, because they&rsquo;ve both said it. They&rsquo;ve both said it.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<i>They&rsquo;ve </i>both <i>said it.</i></p><p>\tAndi is bisexual. Her crush is bisexual!&mdash;Amber thinks, while crying into Andi&rsquo;s shoulder, with reckless happiness. It&rsquo;s not impossible&mdash;it&rsquo;s not.</p><p>\tAnd then the tears keep coming.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt&rsquo;s almost like that first night they held hands, because their fingers are still locked tightly together. But this time, they both fall back onto the bed, and they breathe, they breathe, they breathe. No more withholding breath like it&rsquo;s a tangible thing&mdash;<i>well,</i> Amber thinks, <i>not until the worry about whether or not she likes me settles in, and the coming out to other people, and the distress about when and who and where. </i>But they made it. They both did.</p><p>\tAmber uses her palm to wipe away Andi&rsquo;s tears, and Andi does the same. And they lay back against Amber&rsquo;s comforter, all the words used up.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHere they are: alive and ecstatic and apprehensive but so very free.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>\tWhen Buffy spins the bottle, it twirls back around, once, twice, then lands where it should, at a 180 degree angle right toward the boy next to her, because how could it not?</p><p>\tAndi gives her an approving smile and Buffy imagines and hopes Cyrus would give her a twin blessing. And so the two of them&mdash;Buffy and Jonah, Jonah and Buffy&mdash;stumble off to the closet, their hearts skipping beats in sync.</p><p>\tBuffy already has her hand on the doorknob to the first closet she sees before Jonah lets out a little gasp and grabs her wrist. &ldquo;Not that one,&rdquo; he whispers, nodding to the door. Buffy frowns, then remembers.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I almost just walked in on TJ Kippen and my best friend,&rdquo; Buffy snorts, pulling back her arm.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not good,&rdquo; Jonah says softly. &ldquo;Want to find another closet?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Buffy says, twirling in a circle. Maybe it&rsquo;s the night, maybe it&rsquo;s the darkness of the Kippen basement hallways. But Buffy slides her wrist out from Jonah&rsquo;s hand and instead places her palm in his. Two hands, flat against each other, cupped together, and she drags him to the closet at the end of the hallway, which is, incidentally, about two feet wide and filled with books.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can we fit?&rdquo; Jonah whispers.</p><p>\t&ldquo;We can make it work.&rdquo; Buffy pulls him into the closet, and his fingers flicker against the back of her hand. Once he pulls the door shut, and Buffy manages to click on the light switch next to the wall, she can see the dust cascading over every surface. Jonah coughs: once, twice, then grins sheepishly at her in the pale light.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Allergic to dust?&rdquo; she asks.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Allergic to dust.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m allergic to sleep,&rdquo; Buffy says, leaning on the shelves on the wall. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t gotten more than six hours in the past three weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;This <i>is </i>a sleepover, so, were you planning to sleep tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>\tBuffy laughs sharply, tugging on Jonah&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worse than TJ,&rdquo; Jonah says, squinting.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t compare me to TJ,&rdquo; Buffy fires back, almost dropping his hand. Jonah laughs, in that Jonah Beck way: his eyes crinkle and his dimples deepen and he smiles with his teeth. Buffy, who has only ever been able to find a small group of individuals <i>attractive</i> in her entire life, thinks this needs to be added to the list. Thinks Jonah needs to be added to the list.&nbsp;</p><p>\t16-year old Jonah Beck looks like the 13-year old Jonah Beck who first tossed her a frisbee, and he doesn&rsquo;t. The dimples and eyes are the same; the frame and height are not. Finally, in the end of eighth grade, Jonah shot up and reached her height so she could no longer tease him about being unable to touch the rim of a basketball hoop,or catch frisbees that were thrown too high. Now he still has the shadow of middle school heartthrob Jonah, but he has the essence of the Jonah who had his heart broken by Kira Summers freshman year. Buffy thinks about how she&rsquo;s known him all this time: skateboards and frisbees and attempted posters for Kira and all of it. She didn&rsquo;t really start to like him until this calendar year, not until after she and Marty ended up in pieces, and Kira and Jonah were done for good. After that it was movies at Jonah&rsquo;s house, it was skating down main street and stopping at Karl&rsquo;s to watch basketball on tv. It was Jonah and Buffy, unattached.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey Buffy,&rdquo; Jonah says. &ldquo;Look what book&rsquo;s behind you.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBuffy spins around, still gripping Jonah&rsquo;s hand, and scans the shelves. Her eyes land immediately on the one he wants her to pick out: <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Between their joint performance in English class of the balcony scene, and Andi&rsquo;s earlier remark, it feels like a vital piece of their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Remember when I fell?&rdquo; Buffy says, then starts to laugh. She had been attempting to stand on top of a desk and emulate Juliet&rsquo;s stance, but the legs had wobbled too much underneath her and she had tumbled directly on top of Jonah.</p><p>\t&ldquo;How could I forget? I was only permanently scarred by your nails scratching me.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;It was just payback for that one time you skated into me.&rdquo;</p><p>\tJonah laughs, shrugging, then pulls her back from the shelf so they&rsquo;re facing. And Buffy doesn&rsquo;t want to wait anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Jonah, do you have a crush?&rdquo;</p><p>\tA beat.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Um. Yes.&rdquo; A second pause, then: &ldquo;Someone at the sleepover.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBuffy inhales, then curses herself for it, because she&rsquo;s showing her hand. She wants so badly for Jonah to say it&rsquo;s her, but she&rsquo;s already running through all of the other people it could be: Andi, Amber&mdash;he denied it before, but still. Maybe it&rsquo;s TJ or Cyrus. Buffy doesn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;</p><p>\tTheir hands are still entangled tightly together, but neither of them seems to realize it. Instead, Buffy scoots a tiny bit closer to Jonah, and asks:&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Andi?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe shakes his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made my peace with that, believe me.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Amber?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tJonah laughs. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I already explain this?&rdquo;</p><p>\t<i>Then who?</i> Buffy doesn&rsquo;t dare to hope.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Is it&hellip; TJ? Cyrus?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tJonah shakes his head to both names, and Buffy notices the way his lips inflect at the mention of boys&rsquo; names: not like he&rsquo;s surprised, like he&rsquo;s resigned. Another story for another time.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe tightens his hold on her hand, and twists the hairband on her wrist. Buffy&rsquo;s waiting, waiting, waiting, just like she has for years, through Andi and Libby and Kira. She wasn&rsquo;t waiting for Jonah, at first, but she was waiting for this moment.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Jonah,&rdquo; she says carefully. He flicks up his green-blue eyes at her, captured under thin eyelashes. He&rsquo;s so <i>nice</i> to look at, so considerate and talented and stupid, sometimes. &ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;me?&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe half closes her eyes, preparing to wince. But that&rsquo;s only a reflex, because she&rsquo;s Buffy Driscoll. Buffy <i>Driscoll</i>, and she knows they&rsquo;re meant to be here, in the closet, in the dying light. She knows what the answer is, in a very Han-Solo-type way.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Um.&rdquo;</p><p>\tPause.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBuffy laughs, and it&rsquo;s in the confession that she sees Jonah&rsquo;s vulnerability. So she squeezes his hand, and says this:</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good. Considering I like you too.&rdquo; His eyes go wide.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&mdash;really?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Really, Jonah Beck. I really do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tJonah stares in amazement, and Buffy stares right back, smiling, because finally, finally, finally.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey&rsquo;re still holding hands a couple minutes later when Buffy yawns, closing her eyes. &ldquo;You hungry? Up for an almost midnight snack?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; Jonah Beck says, and pulls her out the door, swinging hands and laughing in the dark.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>\tCyrus thinks he understands now what it means to be glowing. He and TJ are still sitting in the closet, talking about who knows what. He keeps looking at TJ&rsquo;s smile, and thinking: he&rsquo;s part of the reason for that smile. And then Cyrus smiles, and TJ laughs, and they both glow.&nbsp;</p><p>\tEventually, TJ tilts his head to the side and asks, &ldquo;Wanna get some food? PB and J didn&rsquo;t exactly cut it.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Muffins?&rdquo; Cyrus says hopefully.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Chocolate chocolate chip!&rdquo; TJ shouts, then laughs. Cyrus shakes his head.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you think they make lemon-flavored muffins?&rdquo;</p><p>\tTJ drops Cyrus&rsquo;s hand and gapes at him. &ldquo;Please tell me you&rsquo;re joking.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not! They would be good!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Lemons are sour!&rdquo; TJ insists.&nbsp;</p><p>\tCyrus can&rsquo;t resist it. &ldquo;Like you?&rdquo;</p><p>\tTJ just shakes his head. &ldquo;I like to think I&rsquo;m sweet&mdash;wait no, <i>you&rsquo;re</i> sweet.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sappy.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;So are you!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Muffins it is!&rdquo; Cyrus declares, and grabs TJ&rsquo;s hand. They scramble into the hallway, then TJ, grinning wickedly, presses his back to the wall.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Got to be stealthy,&rdquo; he whispers, and shuffles quietly to where the wall ends, dragging Cyrus with him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Wait&mdash;what about everyone else?&rdquo; Cyrus says nodding towards the corner. TJ puts his ear to the wall, biting his lip as he listens. Then he shakes his head.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one there.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;Huh. Weird.&rdquo; Cyrus shrugs and follows TJ into the living room, where, sure enough: no one is there. The strings of light twinkle, alone, in the empty room. A few cookies sit forgotten on a tray thrown to the side, and the couch&rsquo;s pillows are scattered across the ground.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Where do you think they went?&rdquo; TJ asks.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We might have just ended the spin the bottle game, considering we broke the rules.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;Did we?&rdquo; TJ asks, eyebrows raised. &ldquo;Or did we just make it more interesting?&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;We were in that closet for more than seven minutes,&rdquo; Cyrus says, &ldquo;but I see your point.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;Personally, my money is on Jonah and your girl ending up together,&rdquo; TJ says. &ldquo;Just an inkling.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Buffy?&rdquo; Cyrus asks, already laughing.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No&mdash;Andi. Of course Buffy. Did you see their flirting earlier?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yup. I&rsquo;ve got eyes. I believe it. Now onto the muffins!&rdquo; Cyrus pulls TJ into the little basement kitchen, only to see:<br />\n\tJonah looking guiltily over at them, with his free hand dipping a cracker into a peanut butter jar, and his other hand clutching Buffy&rsquo;s. Buffy, on the other hand, raises her eyebrows at the two of them, a challenge, and Cyrus can see the cookie crumbs on her lips.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; TJ says, but he&rsquo;s grinning.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThen he whispers, &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; to Cyrus.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhile Jonah slowly takes the cracker out of the jar and puts it into his mouth, it occurs to Cyrus that he and TJ are also holding hands.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Buffy says, like it&rsquo;s in a dream. She looks down at TJ and Cyrus&rsquo;s hands, eyes dancing with excitement.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Cyrus says back.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We lost Andi and Amber,&rdquo; Jonah says, nodding, and exchanges a look with Buffy. Cyrus bites his lip, grinning, and thinking: maybe, all his friends get to be happy tonight. TJ, though, looks lost. Cyrus figures he&rsquo;ll get it soon.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;How was the rest of spin the bottle?&rdquo; Cyrus asks.</p><p>\tBuffy chokes on the cup of water she&rsquo;s drinking. &ldquo;It was&hellip; interesting.&rdquo; Jonah gives her a little shove, and Cyrus&rsquo;s eyes go to their intertwined hands.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; TJ says, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all great. But we need muffins.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Be my guest,&rdquo; Jonah says, gesturing to the fridge. TJ squints at him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;This is my house.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m eternally grateful for&mdash;ah&mdash;&ldquo; Buffy shoves Jonah, and he looks back over at TJ. &ldquo;Sorry. The muffins are in the fridge. We haven&rsquo;t touched them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tTJ just tilts his head to the side in that TJ way and reaches past them to take the muffins from the fridge. Buffy bumps Cyrus, who has been pulled along, and mouths a scream of happiness. It comes across like a keyboard smash, and Cyrus smiles back to convey the same emotion for her. They&rsquo;ve both finally made reality what they&rsquo;ve wanted for so long.</p><p>\tOnce TJ grabs the muffins, he glances one more time over at Jonah. Cyrus considers two pieces of information in his head: TJ and Jonah have been fighting for years. Cyrus used to be head over heels for Jonah.</p><p>\tThe second feeling is long gone, though, and, with these two boys in front of him, Cyrus hopes the first is beginning to dissolve as well. Jonah is still important to him, and he doesn&rsquo;t want TJ and Jonah&rsquo;s fighting to ever cause problems. Now, in the way Jonah looks at TJ, like he&rsquo;s full of regret, Cyrus thinks the schism might be almost healed. He knows, though, that it&rsquo;s not his battle to fight. It&rsquo;s theirs.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Have fun!&rdquo; TJ says brightly, and Cyrus waves behind his shoulder as the two of them run up the stairs. Buffy waves back, smiling kindly, and Jonah just looks on.&nbsp;</p><p>\tOnce they&rsquo;re up the basement stairs and running toward the main staircase, the adrenaline kicks in. Cyrus starts laughing, and then so does TJ, and they somehow make it to TJ&rsquo;s room before they collapse. TJ falls back on his bed, and Cyrus sprawls on the floor, next to the muffins.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No lemon,&rdquo; Cyrus says, as he looks through the flavors.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Chocolate?&rdquo; TJ asks, rolling over onto his stomach, and looking down at the plastic container.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;The very same flavor from the first day we met,&rdquo; Cyrus affirms, and tosses the wrapped chocolate muffin up to TJ. Somehow, TJ&rsquo;s athletic ability makes up for Cyrus&rsquo;s horrible throw, and he catches it.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Remember that?&rdquo; TJ says, unwrapping the muffin and already starting to split it.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Cyrus says. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Tastes good,&rdquo; TJ announces, with a mouth full of chocolate.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not as good as lemon!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Stop it with the lemon,&rdquo; TJ protests, reaching for a pillow to toss down at him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;The Kippen household pillows are really being abused today.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tTJ shrugs, and hands him the other half of the muffin. &ldquo;My parents won&rsquo;t mind. As long as Amber and I clean up.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Leave the lights and decorations up, though. They&rsquo;re pretty,&rdquo; Cyrus says.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah I think I will. To preserve the memory, you know?&rdquo; TJ says. He jumps off the bed, shuffles around in his closet, and pulls out two sleeping bags. His eyebrows raise, like a question.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Tired already, TJ-no-middle-name-Kippen?&rdquo; Cyrus says, dubious.</p><p>\t&ldquo;The J is my middle name, and this is a <i>sleep</i>over. Sleep.&rdquo; TJ lays out the sleeping bags beside each other, lays back on one of them, and pats the other. Cyrus slips down beside him and scoots closer, sighing. He remembers, then, something he wants to ask about.&nbsp;</p><p>\tTurning on his side to face him, he meets TJ&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Hey TJ, when you said you had your first kiss already, um&mdash;&ldquo;<br />\n\tTJ interrupts him, sensing the awkwardness. &ldquo;Yeah. It was with Reed last year.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tCyrus doesn&rsquo;t know what he was expecting, but it wasn&rsquo;t this. He feels his eyebrows go to his forehead. &ldquo;Middle school watermelon Reed?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah. Um. It was at a party, and I wasn&rsquo;t exactly in the best state of mind. It was once.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tCyrus nods, processing. &ldquo;Wow. Interesting first kiss story.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;Yeah, well. This is the first one that mattered.&rdquo; TJ smiles, and a piece of blond hair tracks down in front of his eyes. Cyrus can&rsquo;t even think anymore, because <i>TJ Kippen</i> just said that about their kiss and he&rsquo;s right here and he&rsquo;s smiling and&mdash;</p><p>\t<i>Yeah, </i>Cyrus thinks,<i> the thing about Reed doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.</i></p><p><i>\t</i>They curl up in the sleeping bags, trying to be warm from TJ&rsquo;s fan and the waves of cold coming from the window. And they talk and talk and talk. Cyrus thinks: <i>perfect perfect perfect </i>until his mind overloads and is, for once, quiet.</p><p>\tQuiet until, strangely like a horror movie, someone bangs on the door.</p><p>\tTJ sits up, rubbing his eyes, and frowns over at Cyrus.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Get up, lovebirds!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Andi&rsquo;s voice. Then Amber knocks down the door, possibly with a kick, and runs over to them.</p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Cyrus says, like he just woke up.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Nope! We&rsquo;re sleeping downstairs. Bring the sleeping bags,&rdquo; Amber announces, reaching out a hand for TJ. He takes it and reluctantly stands up, looking between Andi and his sister.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re glowing. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; <i>Glowing.</i> Cyrus hopes, for Andi&rsquo;s sake, it means what he thinks it means.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I never kiss and tell,&rdquo; Amber says, with narrowed eyes and a tiny grin. Andi doubles over coughing, stands up, and shoves Amber to the side.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&mdash;what?&rdquo; TJ gapes at the two of them. Cyrus only stands up, shrugs, and gives TJ a look that says: <i>you&rsquo;ll figure it out someday.&nbsp;</i></p><p>\t&ldquo;They grow up so fast,&rdquo; Andi says, smiling at Cyrus and TJ. When Cyrus frowns, Andi shrugs. &ldquo;We did say we were your mothers earlier.&rdquo; Laughing, Cyrus gathers up the sleeping bags and throws one of them into TJ&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, people!&rdquo; Amber shouts, laughing, and the four of them race and tumble down the stairs toward the basement. Andi nearly trips on the fourth step down, but TJ catches her, then pushes her back to her feet with a flourish. Cyrus tosses his sleeping back to the ground below and Amber jumps on top of it, sticks the landing, tosses her hair, and looks back up at them.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Jonah! Buffy!&rdquo; Andi shouts. In a split second, the pair appears around the corner, looking only slightly guilty.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Grab some pillows,&rdquo; Amber directs Buffy. &ldquo;TJ, run up to mom&rsquo;s room and pull down some blankets and comforters. Jonah, you go too,&rdquo; she orders, a mirror of earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAndi, Amber, and Cyrus go about clearing the space around the couch, and Amber drags the coffee table off to the side. Once the other four return, chaos fills the room, as sleeping bags and pillows are laid on the ground, and other pillow walls are thrown up:<br />\n\t&ldquo;Use the ottoman&mdash;&ldquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;No, not that one, it&rsquo;s too comfortable to be a ceiling&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;One, two, three&hellip; six pillows, okay good&mdash;&ldquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;TJ! Stop flirting with Cyrus!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh! Throw some fairy lights over the top. And turn off the rest in the room.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThat last comment is Amber, and as her vision takes shape, she holds onto Andi. The pillow fort is decidedly big enough for six people, and though it may collapse sometime during the night, no one seems to care.</p><p>\t&ldquo;We do make a good team,&rdquo; Cyrus decides, looking over their creation. &ldquo;All six of us.&rdquo;</p><p>\tAcross the room, Andi thinks about how three years ago, this sleepover would have been a fever dream. She clutches to the memory of an hour ago, when she and Amber whispered words they each never though they could say aloud to each other. She thinks about every single complex relationship in this room: couples and crushes and ex-crushes and best friends and tentative rivals and mending friendships and twins. She thinks about how they all made it here, today.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey all collapse into the fort together, on knees and elbows and backs. Jonah clicks on the last string of lights, giving them dim brightness to see by.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Truth or dare?&rdquo; Amber whispers, and someone throws a pillow at her.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; Cyrus says quietly, cuddled up somewhere in the middle of TJ and Buffy. He thanks silently in his mind&mdash;of all people&mdash;Amber, for organizing this, so they can all breathe and share and confess in the same space together. A chorus of goodnights echoes back to him: his friends. His <i>friends</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>\tOutside, the snow hasn&rsquo;t stopped, and it piles down across streets and sidewalks and front yards. While the Kippen house&mdash;eventually&mdash;sleeps, lights twinkle in the sky, and the night goes on.&nbsp;</p><p><b>END PART 2</b></p>",

His mouth falls agape, though, as he stares at Amber.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;Spin the <i>bottle</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAndi leans a little more on Amber, laughs nervously, then laughs with more certainty. &ldquo;No, spin the baby tater. Of course spin the bottle!&rdquo; Cyrus gives her a worried look, putting a noticeable space between himself and TJ, who runs to the lights and flicks them back on.</p>\n<p>\tBuffy offers no comment, just taps Jonah&rsquo;s shoulder so she&rsquo;ll let him down. Then she accidentally bumps shoulders with him as they stumble over to the couch and sit down next to each other. Jonah feels the nerves on his skin stand up at the wisp of contact: a quiet shock.</p>\n<p>\tStill stepping around fairy lights, Andi whispers something furtively to Amber, who bites her lip and shrugs. Then, regaining her composure, she smiles and runs back over to the couch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;Who has a bottle? A water bottle&mdash;uh, Buffy? You&rsquo;re a runner.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tBuffy raises her eyebrows but pulls a water bottle from seemingly out of nowhere with no visible reluctance. It&rsquo;s silvery and dented and clearly not meant for playing spin the bottle in basements, but then again they&rsquo;re not exactly meant for this either. Jonah glances around the room, and tallies: TJ has never dated anyone, Cyrus and TJ probably like each other, Buffy hasn&rsquo;t dated anyone except Marty, Amber doesn&rsquo;t seem to date anymore, as a rule, Andi had Walker and Jonah and then no one else every again, and Jonah&mdash;</p>\n<p>\tIt occurs to Jonah that he&rsquo;s dated the most people out of everyone in this room. And that he&rsquo;s kissed not one, but three girls.</p>\n<p>\tIt also occurs to him that the first and only girl who has made him understand the expression <i>butterflies in your stomach</i> is sitting in this room. Next to him. Holding a bottle.</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; Amber shouts, snatching the bottle from Buffy and depositing it on the coffee table in front of the couch. Cyrus hastily picks up the remnants of the cinnamon cookies, glancing at TJ, then chucks them in the corner. Neither of the Kippens comment, and Amber continues speaking. &ldquo;So&hellip;.&rdquo; she sighs. &ldquo;We should probably not do the lips, considering only, what&mdash;two?&mdash;of the people in this room have had their first kiss?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\tEyes flash to Jonah, and to Andi. Jonah feels Buffy watching him from his left, but he doesn&rsquo;t react. He meets Andi&rsquo;s eyes across the couch, who is grinning sheepishly. They&rsquo;ve talked about it&mdash;awkwardly&mdash;before: how they&rsquo;re first kiss was in middle school, and strangely spontaneous, and in plain view of several other people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tJonah remembers another kiss&mdash;then winces at the memory. It was his last kiss with Kira, under fluorescent roller skating lights. Two weeks later Jonah&rsquo;s stray physics homework and skateboard stickers had been evicted from Kira&rsquo;s house, and Jonah was no longer welcome at the Jefferson high school girls basketball games. Buffy had consoled him, which had always felt like a big thing: Buffy choosing Jonah over Kira. But maybe she wasn&rsquo;t, because Kira and Buffy still kept their tentative, basketball-centric, passive-aggressive friendship around.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tMaybe it didn&rsquo;t matter. Jonah wanted his slate to be wiped clean. He wanted to be like Amber or Cyrus tonight, never having kissed someone and still dying to find out. He wanted&mdash;</p>\n<p>\tLike a pesky firefly, a thought pricked at his mind: he wanted Buffy to have been his first.</p>\n<p>\tBut this is what he gets, tonight. Buffy leans a little into him, still shaping a smile at Andi: her best friend. Then, finally, she speaks:</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;If two people spin each other twice, seven minutes in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAmber lets out a scream of excitement, twisting in her seat. &ldquo;Perfect&mdash;wait, one more thing.&rdquo; She jumps from the couch and hurries back to the light switch, flipping it and leaving the room in suspended darkness, pinpointed with various strings of light. There&rsquo;s enough light to see the faces of each person sitting around the couch, in this order: Jonah, Buffy, Amber, Andi, Cyrus, TJ.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;I better not spin you, Driscoll,&rdquo; TJ says jokingly, in a way that says he asking for forgiveness, for the tenth or twentieth or fiftieth time. Part of Jonah wants TJ to say something to him with the same look in his eyes, because Jonah is sick and tired of wanting move on from middle school things&mdash;it&rsquo;s why he went with TJ to get the decorations, it&rsquo;s why he likes to spend time around Buffy and TJ together: because they&rsquo;re all forgiving each other, in their own ways, for what happened months and years ago.</p>\n<p>\tJonah knows, also, that part of the reconciliation is on his shoulders. And that it&rsquo;s not a thing for here, tonight.</p>\n<p>\tBuffy scoffs at TJ&rsquo;s remark, but Jonah sees that she&rsquo;s smiling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;If I spin Jonah, we have to remake the moment in the Red Rooster,&rdquo; Andi says, and Jonah blinks in surprise.</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll have to do it awkwardly with everyone watching?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\tAndi chucks a pillow at him, and Jonah lets out a breath like a laugh. He&rsquo;s glad, then, that they can joke like this.</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Amber says, with a realization, &ldquo;three people in this room have had their first kiss.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; Cyrus interrupts, frowning. &ldquo;I had&mdash;I mean, Iris kissed me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tTJ shifts in his seat.</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Buffy says, sitting up from her laid back position. &ldquo;Raise your hand if you&rsquo;ve had your first kiss.</p>\n<p>\tJonah and Andi are the first to place their hands in the air. Then Cyrus, following his prior statement. Then&mdash;TJ?</p>\n<p>\tBuffy and Amber are left with their hands down and mouths working. But Jonah looks over at TJ, thinking about how he&rsquo;s never had a girlfriend. Never had a boyfriend, either.</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;TJ?&rdquo; Andi says, as if reading Jonah&rsquo;s mind.</p>\n<p>\tHe shrugs and leans back. Amber glances over at&mdash;Jonah, of all people, but then shakes her head.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;Okay, well, we&rsquo;re still not doing lips. Not unless you both want to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\tCyrus nods in assent, and it&rsquo;s decided.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tJonah is so close to Buffy. And he&rsquo;s holding his breath. He doesn&rsquo;t know if he wants her to spin him or not, him to spin her or not, for the two of them to end up facing each other in a Kippen closet. Because Jonah doesn&rsquo;t want to also have to face an awful truth that might exist: that Buffy would never, ever like him.</p>\n<p>\tBuffy bumps his shoulder, and he bumps back, heartbeat fluttering. There&rsquo;s cookies and lights and singing, and then there is Buffy&rsquo;s shoulder brushing his. Two different planes of existence.</p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spin first!&rdquo; Andi calls out, breaking the silence. Jonah sees the last glance she gives Amber, ripe with something in the curve of her eyebrows and quirk of her mouth. Then she steps to the bottle, grips the neck, and spins it around and around and around and&mdash;</p>\n<p>\tWhen it stops, it&rsquo;s pointing directly at him.</p>\n</p>",
