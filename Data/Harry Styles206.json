There were several folders in the office, which were constantly updated, but it certainly helped to know the basics. London had become very popular in terms of city weddings, so there were plenty of brides who had visions of their own magazine-perfect day in the perfect venue. The hotel Harry had chosen was new, but it had quickly become my favourite to recommend to brides who wanted something classic yet fresh. Lots of wooden and copper details, marble staircases and mirrors. I was excited to visit the place again \u2014 I just hoped it wasn&rsquo;t going to be ruined with a new bad memory of Harry. I\u2019d already attended a couple of weddings in the other hotels we\u2019d stayed in and it had taken everything not to tell my boss I was sick and needed to go home.</p><p>With a huge sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, I knocked on the door with the room number I\u2019d been given and waited nervously. Harry answered the door, and it felt just like the first time we\u2019d met in a hotel: he was dressed in black skinny jeans and a white tee. His hair was a lot longer than before, but again, there were wet patches where his damp curls lay on his shoulders.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed as though surprised to see me. I had a moment of panic that I&rsquo;d imagined our plans until he smiled and signalled for me to come in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be here yet!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not\u2026 early, am I? We said four, didn-&rdquo;</p><p>Still unsure, I looked down at my watch and let him usher me into the hotel room. Hearing the door close behind me, I realised that once again, I was alone in a hotel suite with Harry \u2014 something I\u2019d told myself would never happen.</p><p>&ldquo;We did! I just lost track of time,&rdquo; he smiled a big, dimpled grin that lit up his whole face, and looked me over. &ldquo;You look so lovely.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cThank you. You don\u2019t look so bad yourself.\u201d I smiled, blushing as we exchanged soft glances, scared to make any real eye contact yet. \u201cI can&rsquo;t believe how long your hair is now.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped a chocolate brown lock around my finger and tugged lightly. As I pulled my hand away, he grabbed hold of my wrist and pressed my palm to his chest. As I felt the warmth of his body through his shirt, an odd mix of nerves and calm washed over me. He wrapped his hand around mine, and our eyes finally met.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That could change,&rdquo; I grinned, gently taking my hand back, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s good to see you, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, he hooked a finger over the belt of my dress and pulled me forward. I held my breath as he lowered his head and leaned in to kiss me.</p><p>&ldquo;I know we need to talk,&rdquo; Harry whispered, lips inches from mine and breath warm against my face, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve waited so long to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>Softly, he kissed me. His mouth barely touched mine as he waited for me to push him away, and I would \u2014 just not yet. As he parted his lips, my tongue collided with his and they greeted each other like old friends. I moaned as he wrapped his arms around me, our bodies pressing together with as much familiarity as our kiss. I tried desperately to keep my thoughts focused \u2014 to not let myself jump straight into bed with him \u2014 but his embrace felt like home.</p><p>When I finally pulled away, I expected to be led to the bedroom. Instead, Harry simply smiled and let out a large sigh. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s out of my system, let&rsquo;s go down to the bar and talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Out of his system? Down to the the bar? This was not the Harry I&rsquo;d come to know or expect.</p><p>Maybe (as I&rsquo;d spent weeks worrying)&hellip; I&rsquo;d lost my appeal?</p><p>I\u2019d wondered if he\u2019d only had an interest in me because of some morbid curiosity in my marriage, I\u2019d spent a lot of my time in a panic that my appeal for him would be lost, or vice versa. We\u2019d both been forbidden fruit \u2014 a dirty, little secret that had become incredibly intense. With none of the secrecy, what did we have? I\u2019d felt the same spark in our kiss, the tingling need in my core, but maybe Harry hadn\u2019t felt it too. Rose and Dee had suggested that the only way of finding out what was left between us would be to meet with him. From his need to get me alone, to kiss me, but then not instantly erupting with desire as he had always previously done, I guessed he had just given me my answer.</p><p>Harry picked up a blue, woollen beanie (not too dissimilar to the one which he\u2019d left in my house and had caused so much trouble) and used it to cover his wet hair. He seemed chipper as he spoke, giving no indication of what he had to say. \u201cDon&rsquo;t worry. I got us a private room so we could have drinks and talk without the pressure of being in a hotel room.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;Strange how you did that this time and not the first time we met in a hotel.&rdquo;</p><p>Not wanting him to know how panicked I felt by being in public with him \u2014 even if it was just a quick walk to a private room \u2014 I turned away and looked around the room. I could see the bed through open double doors, his usual brown leather overnight bag was on it with some clothes spilling out. I turned as I heard him approach me, and once again, we came face to face. I watched his green gaze go to where mine had been, and he flashed a devilish grin that woke the warmth between my thighs. Leaning in again, I waited for him to kiss me but instead he spoke quietly, as though he was confiding a great secret in me.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I was trying to get you into bed that time.&rdquo;</p><p>Feeling my face grow flush, I pouted my lips and asked with a hint of flirtation, \u201cOh? So you\u2019re not going to try that tonight?&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;No.&rdquo; Taking hold of my hand, Harry led me towards the door and opened it. As I walked through, he put his face close to my ear and whispered, &ldquo;not just yet.&rdquo;</p><p>The space wasn&rsquo;t quite a room, but more of a private section of the hotel bar, tucked away from view and usually reserved for larger parties. Though it felt a little ridiculous using it for just the two of us, it was private. It wasn&rsquo;t until we took our seats in the blue, velvet covered booth that I felt semi-safe. Rather than sitting in the middle of curved seat, we remained at the end so we would be face to face. To outsiders, we could be just having a business lunch, for all they knew. There was no cosiness or closeness.</p><p>We ordered drinks and decided to talk a little before we ate. Harry, being Harry, had arranged so we could order from the restaurant menu and they would bring it to the bar. After drinks had arrived and we were left alone, I cleared my throat and broke the awkward silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose we\u2019d better talk and clear the air.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</p><p>I was struck by how lovely he looked as he stared intensely at his hands curving around the bottom of his glass. His hair, now dry, was long enough to poke out from his hat, and his face was losing its puppy fat, giving him a jaw that I was sure could cut glass. I could see that he was going to be even more handsome as he grew older \u2014 something I truly didn&rsquo;t think was possible.</p><p>\u201cI panicked. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d leave Will, and I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d really want to be with me,\u201d he shrugged as he finally raised his gaze to me. \u201cIt was like I was feeling more for you than you were for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I loved you. I told you I would leave him for you.\u201d I was trying not to get angry \u2014 trying not to show the hurt he caused \u2014 but the ice in my glass was melting alarmingly fast from my tight, heated grip around it. \u201cYou say you meant what you said. Well, so did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you though? Really? You\u2019d told me you didn\u2019t love me, that I didn\u2019t know you.\u201d Tone sullen, Harry looked defiant. Suddenly, we were two people too scared and too hurt to be truly vulnerable with each other again.</p><p>\u201cI did love you, Harry. I was too scared to admit it. Sex with someone is one thing in an affair \u2014 love is something else entirely.\u201d</p><p>He looked away again \u2014 this time to order another round of drinks. I hadn\u2019t noticed that he\u2019d emptied his glass, so I drained mine to match. We fell silent again as we waited for the second round to arrive, looking at our phones or around at the decor.</p><p>Alone again, he took a sip of his liquid courage and asked quietly, refusing to look at me, \u201cSo, you don\u2019t love me anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shook my head and tried to remember what loving him had felt like. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t let myself feel that way for long before you\u2026 Well, anyway, I guess I don\u2019t know what I feel for you anymore. Do you still think you love me?\u201d</p><p>Harry stayed silent for a few seconds, fiddling with the thin, black straw he\u2019d been drinking from. Eventually, he shrugged, looked me in the eye, and nodded. \u201cI tried to convince myself I didn\u2019t, that I was just infatuated or something. But, seeing you before the show, and the hurt and loathing you had for me, I wanted to do anything I could to fix it.\u201d</p><p>Under the table I felt his feet slide to settle on either side of mine. It still didn\u2019t feel right for him to hold my hand, so this was the next best thing. \u201cThe song \u2014 it started as just an idea of what an affair was like. I never thought when I wrote it that I would feel that way, that I&rsquo;d want you to leave Will and be with me, but&hellip;&ldquo; he frowned as he recalled the memory. &quot;That night I saw you crying in the restaurant, I knew it was more than just sex between us.&rdquo;</p><p>I remembered that night vividly. Will\u2019s hurtful words. The way Harry had practically sent his chair flying backwards as he stood up to comfort me. How I&rsquo;d stopped him from coming over, despite wanting him to with all my heart.</p><p>&ldquo;And what about her? We can\u2019t pretend like she didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>&quot;I won&rsquo;t insult you and say it was a mistake or that it didn&rsquo;t mean anything.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s feet tightened against mine as I attempted to pull away, two small lines of frustration forming between his brows from not letting him finish. &ldquo;It was just friends hooking up and nothing more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I meant to feel grateful?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He leaned forward in his seat, fixing his open and honest gaze on me. &ldquo;Layla, listen. I love you, but I didn\u2019t know what to do. You were married, and I couldn\u2019t believe you\u2019d ever choose me and what comes with my life over the one you already had.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought about how horrible I&rsquo;d felt without him. While everything was crumbling around me, I couldn&rsquo;t talk to the one person I knew would make it better. I opened my eyes, grabbed my glass, and drained it until the ice hit my teeth. It was hard to know if I should believe him, to be understanding that the position he\u2019d been in was just as hard as mine. Harry had shown signs of jealousy, but that could have been possessiveness rather than any true feelings he had for me. I just had a hard time believing that someone like Harry \u2014 who lived a blessed life, who had people that loved him, who could snap his fingers and have anything he wanted \u2014 wanted me. I mean, really wanted me. Years of put-downs from Will had left their mark, and I couldn\u2019t believe Harry would want me when there was no reason to have me.</p><p>\u201cI left Will the day after that show. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Can I ask what happened?\u201d</p><p>Harry knew there was somebody else, but (like everyone else) still assumed it was Mia. That\u2019s what the rumours were according to Will and Rose: that I\u2019d found him in bed with his business partner\u2019s daughter and left. Other than Rose, Dee, Mia, and myself, nobody knew about Will and Terry being together, despite the fact that Terry was all but living in our house. I felt a moment of guilt in telling Harry. It wasn\u2019t my secret to share, but it spilled out anyway,</p><p>\u201cWill and I got into a fight about me not wanting to go to your after party. It got pretty intense so I spent the night at Rose\u2019s.\u201d I paused to take a drink. I hadn\u2019t really spoken about what happened to anyone else, and my throat seemed to be tightening as I remembered pushing the bedroom door open. \u201cI\u2019d decided I was going to go home and tell him that it was over \u2014 that I didn\u2019t want to deal with his shit anymore. I got up early, drove home, and&hellip; and I found him in bed with Terry.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Terry?!&rdquo; Harry\u2019s eyes became wide and round like saucers. He went to reach a hand across the table but thankfully stopped himself. \u201cOh, Lil, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Terry.\u201d Hands shaking, it was my turn to look for someone to bring another round. Turning back to face Harry, I saw a look of what felt like pity. I knew that would always be the reaction. &quot;Believe it or not, I\u2019m okay. I feel hurt and betrayed, but they&rsquo;ve been in love since Will was seventeen or so. Mostly, I feel sad that they felt the need to lie.&rdquo;</p>",

There were several folders in the office, which were constantly updated, but it certainly helped to know the basics. London had become very popular in terms of city weddings, so there were plenty of brides who had visions of their own magazine-perfect day in the perfect venue. The hotel Harry had chosen was new, but it had quickly become my favourite to recommend to brides who wanted something classic yet fresh. Lots of wooden and copper details, marble staircases and mirrors. I was excited to visit the place again \u2014 I just hoped it wasn\u2019t going to be ruined with a new bad memory of Harry. I\u2019d already attended a couple of weddings in the other hotels we\u2019d stayed in and it had taken everything not to tell my boss I was sick and needed to go home.</p><p>With a huge sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, I knocked on the door with the room number I\u2019d been given and waited nervously. Harry answered the door, and it felt just like the first time we\u2019d met in a hotel: he was dressed in black skinny jeans and a white tee. His hair was a lot longer than before, but again, there were wet patches where his damp curls lay on his shoulders.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh!\u201d he exclaimed as though surprised to see me. I had a moment of panic that I\u2019d imagined our plans until he smiled and signalled for me to come in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here yet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 early, am I? We said four, didn-\u201d</p><p>Still unsure, I looked down at my watch and let him usher me into the hotel room. Hearing the door close behind me, I realised that once again, I was alone in a hotel suite with Harry \u2014 something I\u2019d told myself would never happen.</p><p>\u201cWe did! I just lost track of time,\u201d he smiled a big, dimpled grin that lit up his whole face, and looked me over. \u201cYou look so lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You don\u2019t look so bad yourself.\u201d I smiled, blushing as we exchanged soft glances, scared to make any real eye contact yet. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how long your hair is now.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped a chocolate brown lock around my finger and tugged lightly. As I pulled my hand away, he grabbed hold of my wrist and pressed my palm to his chest. As I felt the warmth of his body through his shirt, an odd mix of nerves and calm washed over me. He wrapped his hand around mine, and our eyes finally met.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could change,\u201d I grinned, gently taking my hand back, \u201cbut it\u2019s good to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he hooked a finger over the belt of my dress and pulled me forward. I held my breath as he lowered his head and leaned in to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cI know we need to talk,\u201d Harry whispered, lips inches from mine and breath warm against my face, \u201cbut I\u2019ve waited so long to see you.\u201d</p><p>Softly, he kissed me. His mouth barely touched mine as he waited for me to push him away, and I would \u2014 just not yet. As he parted his lips, my tongue collided with his and they greeted each other like old friends. I moaned as he wrapped his arms around me, our bodies pressing together with as much familiarity as our kiss. I tried desperately to keep my thoughts focused \u2014 to not let myself jump straight into bed with him \u2014 but his embrace felt like home.</p><p>When I finally pulled away, I expected to be led to the bedroom. Instead, Harry simply smiled and let out a large sigh. \u201cNow that\u2019s out of my system, let\u2019s go down to the bar and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Out of his system? Down to the the bar? This was not the Harry I\u2019d come to know or expect.</p><p>Maybe (as I\u2019d spent weeks worrying)\u2026 I\u2019d lost my appeal?</p><p>I\u2019d wondered if he\u2019d only had an interest in me because of some morbid curiosity in my marriage, I\u2019d spent a lot of my time in a panic that my appeal for him would be lost, or vice versa. We\u2019d both been forbidden fruit \u2014 a dirty, little secret that had become incredibly intense. With none of the secrecy, what did we have? I\u2019d felt the same spark in our kiss, the tingling need in my core, but maybe Harry hadn\u2019t felt it too. Rose and Dee had suggested that the only way of finding out what was left between us would be to meet with him. From his need to get me alone, to kiss me, but then not instantly erupting with desire as he had always previously done, I guessed he had just given me my answer.</p><p>Harry picked up a blue, woollen beanie (not too dissimilar to the one which he\u2019d left in my house and had caused so much trouble) and used it to cover his wet hair. He seemed chipper as he spoke, giving no indication of what he had to say. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got us a private room so we could have drinks and talk without the pressure of being in a hotel room.\u201c</p><p>\"Strange how you did that this time and not the first time we met in a hotel.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting him to know how panicked I felt by being in public with him \u2014 even if it was just a quick walk to a private room \u2014 I turned away and looked around the room. I could see the bed through open double doors, his usual brown leather overnight bag was on it with some clothes spilling out. I turned as I heard him approach me, and once again, we came face to face. I watched his green gaze go to where mine had been, and he flashed a devilish grin that woke the warmth between my thighs. Leaning in again, I waited for him to kiss me but instead he spoke quietly, as though he was confiding a great secret in me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I was trying to get you into bed that time.\u201d</p><p>Feeling my face grow flush, I pouted my lips and asked with a hint of flirtation, \u201cOh? So you\u2019re not going to try that tonight?\u201c</p><p>\"No.\u201d Taking hold of my hand, Harry led me towards the door and opened it. As I walked through, he put his face close to my ear and whispered, \u201cnot just yet.\u201d</p><p>The space wasn\u2019t quite a room, but more of a private section of the hotel bar, tucked away from view and usually reserved for larger parties. Though it felt a little ridiculous using it for just the two of us, it was private. It wasn\u2019t until we took our seats in the blue, velvet covered booth that I felt semi-safe. Rather than sitting in the middle of curved seat, we remained at the end so we would be face to face. To outsiders, we could be just having a business lunch, for all they knew. There was no cosiness or closeness.</p><p>We ordered drinks and decided to talk a little before we ate. Harry, being Harry, had arranged so we could order from the restaurant menu and they would bring it to the bar. After drinks had arrived and we were left alone, I cleared my throat and broke the awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019d better talk and clear the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>I was struck by how lovely he looked as he stared intensely at his hands curving around the bottom of his glass. His hair, now dry, was long enough to poke out from his hat, and his face was losing its puppy fat, giving him a jaw that I was sure could cut glass. I could see that he was going to be even more handsome as he grew older \u2014 something I truly didn\u2019t think was possible.</p><p>\u201cI panicked. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d leave Will, and I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d really want to be with me,\u201d he shrugged as he finally raised his gaze to me. \u201cIt was like I was feeling more for you than you were for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I loved you. I told you I would leave him for you.\u201d I was trying not to get angry \u2014 trying not to show the hurt he caused \u2014 but the ice in my glass was melting alarmingly fast from my tight, heated grip around it. \u201cYou say you meant what you said. Well, so did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you though? Really? You\u2019d told me you didn\u2019t love me, that I didn\u2019t know you.\u201d Tone sullen, Harry looked defiant. Suddenly, we were two people too scared and too hurt to be truly vulnerable with each other again.</p><p>\u201cI did love you, Harry. I was too scared to admit it. Sex with someone is one thing in an affair \u2014 love is something else entirely.\u201d</p><p>He looked away again \u2014 this time to order another round of drinks. I hadn\u2019t noticed that he\u2019d emptied his glass, so I drained mine to match. We fell silent again as we waited for the second round to arrive, looking at our phones or around at the decor.</p><p>Alone again, he took a sip of his liquid courage and asked quietly, refusing to look at me, \u201cSo, you don\u2019t love me anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shook my head and tried to remember what loving him had felt like. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t let myself feel that way for long before you\u2026 Well, anyway, I guess I don\u2019t know what I feel for you anymore. Do you still think you love me?\u201d</p><p>Harry stayed silent for a few seconds, fiddling with the thin, black straw he\u2019d been drinking from. Eventually, he shrugged, looked me in the eye, and nodded. \u201cI tried to convince myself I didn\u2019t, that I was just infatuated or something. But, seeing you before the show, and the hurt and loathing you had for me, I wanted to do anything I could to fix it.\u201d</p><p>Under the table I felt his feet slide to settle on either side of mine. It still didn\u2019t feel right for him to hold my hand, so this was the next best thing. \u201cThe song \u2014 it started as just an idea of what an affair was like. I never thought when I wrote it that I would feel that way, that I\u2019d want you to leave Will and be with me, but\u2026\u201c he frowned as he recalled the memory. \"That night I saw you crying in the restaurant, I knew it was more than just sex between us.\u201d</p><p>I remembered that night vividly. Will\u2019s hurtful words. The way Harry had practically sent his chair flying backwards as he stood up to comfort me. How I\u2019d stopped him from coming over, despite wanting him to with all my heart.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about her? We can\u2019t pretend like she didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\"I won\u2019t insult you and say it was a mistake or that it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Harry\u2019s feet tightened against mine as I attempted to pull away, two small lines of frustration forming between his brows from not letting him finish. \u201cIt was just friends hooking up and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I meant to feel grateful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He leaned forward in his seat, fixing his open and honest gaze on me. \u201cLayla, listen. I love you, but I didn\u2019t know what to do. You were married, and I couldn\u2019t believe you\u2019d ever choose me and what comes with my life over the one you already had.\u201d</p><p>I thought about how horrible I\u2019d felt without him. While everything was crumbling around me, I couldn\u2019t talk to the one person I knew would make it better. I opened my eyes, grabbed my glass, and drained it until the ice hit my teeth. It was hard to know if I should believe him, to be understanding that the position he\u2019d been in was just as hard as mine. Harry had shown signs of jealousy, but that could have been possessiveness rather than any true feelings he had for me. I just had a hard time believing that someone like Harry \u2014 who lived a blessed life, who had people that loved him, who could snap his fingers and have anything he wanted \u2014 wanted me. I mean, really wanted me. Years of put-downs from Will had left their mark, and I couldn\u2019t believe Harry would want me when there was no reason to have me.</p><p>\u201cI left Will the day after that show. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Can I ask what happened?\u201d</p><p>Harry knew there was somebody else, but (like everyone else) still assumed it was Mia. That\u2019s what the rumours were according to Will and Rose: that I\u2019d found him in bed with his business partner\u2019s daughter and left. Other than Rose, Dee, Mia, and myself, nobody knew about Will and Terry being together, despite the fact that Terry was all but living in our house. I felt a moment of guilt in telling Harry. It wasn\u2019t my secret to share, but it spilled out anyway,</p><p>\u201cWill and I got into a fight about me not wanting to go to your after party. It got pretty intense so I spent the night at Rose\u2019s.\u201d I paused to take a drink. I hadn\u2019t really spoken about what happened to anyone else, and my throat seemed to be tightening as I remembered pushing the bedroom door open. \u201cI\u2019d decided I was going to go home and tell him that it was over \u2014 that I didn\u2019t want to deal with his shit anymore. I got up early, drove home, and\u2026 and I found him in bed with Terry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerry?!\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes became wide and round like saucers. He went to reach a hand across the table but thankfully stopped himself. \u201cOh, Lil, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerry.\u201d Hands shaking, it was my turn to look for someone to bring another round. Turning back to face Harry, I saw a look of what felt like pity. I knew that would always be the reaction. \"Believe it or not, I\u2019m okay. I feel hurt and betrayed, but they\u2019ve been in love since Will was seventeen or so. Mostly, I feel sad that they felt the need to lie.\u201d</p>",

We said four, didn-\u201d</p><p>Still unsure, I looked down at my watch and let him usher me into the hotel room. Hearing the door close behind me, I realised that once again, I was alone in a hotel suite with Harry \u2014 something I\u2019d told myself would never happen.</p><p>\u201cWe did! I just lost track of time,\u201d he smiled a big, dimpled grin that lit up his whole face, and looked me over. \u201cYou look so lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You don\u2019t look so bad yourself.\u201d I smiled, blushing as we exchanged soft glances, scared to make any real eye contact yet. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how long your hair is now.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped a chocolate brown lock around my finger and tugged lightly. As I pulled my hand away, he grabbed hold of my wrist and pressed my palm to his chest. As I felt the warmth of his body through his shirt, an odd mix of nerves and calm washed over me. He wrapped his hand around mine, and our eyes finally met.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could change,\u201d I grinned, gently taking my hand back, \u201cbut it\u2019s good to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he hooked a finger over the belt of my dress and pulled me forward. I held my breath as he lowered his head and leaned in to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cI know we need to talk,\u201d Harry whispered, lips inches from mine and breath warm against my face, \u201cbut I\u2019ve waited so long to see you.\u201d</p><p>Softly, he kissed me. His mouth barely touched mine as he waited for me to push him away, and I would \u2014 just not yet. As he parted his lips, my tongue collided with his and they greeted each other like old friends. I moaned as he wrapped his arms around me, our bodies pressing together with as much familiarity as our kiss. I tried desperately to keep my thoughts focused \u2014 to not let myself jump straight into bed with him \u2014 but his embrace felt like home.</p><p>When I finally pulled away, I expected to be led to the bedroom. Instead, Harry simply smiled and let out a large sigh. \u201cNow that\u2019s out of my system, let\u2019s go down to the bar and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Out of his system? Down to the the bar? This was not the Harry I\u2019d come to know or expect.</p><p>Maybe (as I\u2019d spent weeks worrying)\u2026 I\u2019d lost my appeal?</p><p>I\u2019d wondered if he\u2019d only had an interest in me because of some morbid curiosity in my marriage, I\u2019d spent a lot of my time in a panic that my appeal for him would be lost, or vice versa. We\u2019d both been forbidden fruit \u2014 a dirty, little secret that had become incredibly intense. With none of the secrecy, what did we have? I\u2019d felt the same spark in our kiss, the tingling need in my core, but maybe Harry hadn\u2019t felt it too. Rose and Dee had suggested that the only way of finding out what was left between us would be to meet with him. From his need to get me alone, to kiss me, but then not instantly erupting with desire as he had always previously done, I guessed he had just given me my answer.</p><p>Harry picked up a blue, woollen beanie (not too dissimilar to the one which he\u2019d left in my house and had caused so much trouble) and used it to cover his wet hair. He seemed chipper as he spoke, giving no indication of what he had to say. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got us a private room so we could have drinks and talk without the pressure of being in a hotel room.\u201c</p><p>\"Strange how you did that this time and not the first time we met in a hotel.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting him to know how panicked I felt by being in public with him \u2014 even if it was just a quick walk to a private room \u2014 I turned away and looked around the room. I could see the bed through open double doors, his usual brown leather overnight bag was on it with some clothes spilling out. I turned as I heard him approach me, and once again, we came face to face. I watched his green gaze go to where mine had been, and he flashed a devilish grin that woke the warmth between my thighs. Leaning in again, I waited for him to kiss me but instead he spoke quietly, as though he was confiding a great secret in me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I was trying to get you into bed that time.\u201d</p><p>Feeling my face grow flush, I pouted my lips and asked with a hint of flirtation, \u201cOh? So you\u2019re not going to try that tonight?\u201c</p><p>\"No.\u201d Taking hold of my hand, Harry led me towards the door and opened it. As I walked through, he put his face close to my ear and whispered, \u201cnot just yet.\u201d</p><p>The space wasn\u2019t quite a room, but more of a private section of the hotel bar, tucked away from view and usually reserved for larger parties. Though it felt a little ridiculous using it for just the two of us, it was private. It wasn\u2019t until we took our seats in the blue, velvet covered booth that I felt semi-safe. Rather than sitting in the middle of curved seat, we remained at the end so we would be face to face. To outsiders, we could be just having a business lunch, for all they knew. There was no cosiness or closeness.</p><p>We ordered drinks and decided to talk a little before we ate. Harry, being Harry, had arranged so we could order from the restaurant menu and they would bring it to the bar. After drinks had arrived and we were left alone, I cleared my throat and broke the awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019d better talk and clear the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>I was struck by how lovely he looked as he stared intensely at his hands curving around the bottom of his glass. His hair, now dry, was long enough to poke out from his hat, and his face was losing its puppy fat, giving him a jaw that I was sure could cut glass. I could see that he was going to be even more handsome as he grew older \u2014 something I truly didn\u2019t think was possible.</p><p>\u201cI panicked. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d leave Will, and I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d really want to be with me,\u201d he shrugged as he finally raised his gaze to me. \u201cIt was like I was feeling more for you than you were for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I loved you. I told you I would leave him for you.\u201d I was trying not to get angry \u2014 trying not to show the hurt he caused \u2014 but the ice in my glass was melting alarmingly fast from my tight, heated grip around it. \u201cYou say you meant what you said. Well, so did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you though? Really? You\u2019d told me you didn\u2019t love me, that I didn\u2019t know you.\u201d Tone sullen, Harry looked defiant. Suddenly, we were two people too scared and too hurt to be truly vulnerable with each other again.</p><p>\u201cI did love you, Harry. I was too scared to admit it. Sex with someone is one thing in an affair \u2014 love is something else entirely.\u201d</p><p>He looked away again \u2014 this time to order another round of drinks. I hadn\u2019t noticed that he\u2019d emptied his glass, so I drained mine to match. We fell silent again as we waited for the second round to arrive, looking at our phones or around at the decor.</p><p>Alone again, he took a sip of his liquid courage and asked quietly, refusing to look at me, \u201cSo, you don\u2019t love me anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shook my head and tried to remember what loving him had felt like. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t let myself feel that way for long before you\u2026 Well, anyway, I guess I don\u2019t know what I feel for you anymore. Do you still think you love me?\u201d</p><p>Harry stayed silent for a few seconds, fiddling with the thin, black straw he\u2019d been drinking from. Eventually, he shrugged, looked me in the eye, and nodded. \u201cI tried to convince myself I didn\u2019t, that I was just infatuated or something. But, seeing you before the show, and the hurt and loathing you had for me, I wanted to do anything I could to fix it.\u201d</p><p>Under the table I felt his feet slide to settle on either side of mine. It still didn\u2019t feel right for him to hold my hand, so this was the next best thing. \u201cThe song \u2014 it started as just an idea of what an affair was like. I never thought when I wrote it that I would feel that way, that I\u2019d want you to leave Will and be with me, but\u2026\u201c he frowned as he recalled the memory. \"That night I saw you crying in the restaurant, I knew it was more than just sex between us.\u201d</p><p>I remembered that night vividly. Will\u2019s hurtful words. The way Harry had practically sent his chair flying backwards as he stood up to comfort me. How I\u2019d stopped him from coming over, despite wanting him to with all my heart.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about her? We can\u2019t pretend like she didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\"I won\u2019t insult you and say it was a mistake or that it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Harry\u2019s feet tightened against mine as I attempted to pull away, two small lines of frustration forming between his brows from not letting him finish. \u201cIt was just friends hooking up and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I meant to feel grateful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He leaned forward in his seat, fixing his open and honest gaze on me. \u201cLayla, listen. I love you, but I didn\u2019t know what to do. You were married, and I couldn\u2019t believe you\u2019d ever choose me and what comes with my life over the one you already had.\u201d</p><p>I thought about how horrible I\u2019d felt without him. While everything was crumbling around me, I couldn\u2019t talk to the one person I knew would make it better. I opened my eyes, grabbed my glass, and drained it until the ice hit my teeth. It was hard to know if I should believe him, to be understanding that the position he\u2019d been in was just as hard as mine. Harry had shown signs of jealousy, but that could have been possessiveness rather than any true feelings he had for me. I just had a hard time believing that someone like Harry \u2014 who lived a blessed life, who had people that loved him, who could snap his fingers and have anything he wanted \u2014 wanted me. I mean, really wanted me. Years of put-downs from Will had left their mark, and I couldn\u2019t believe Harry would want me when there was no reason to have me.</p><p>\u201cI left Will the day after that show. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Can I ask what happened?\u201d</p><p>Harry knew there was somebody else, but (like everyone else) still assumed it was Mia. That\u2019s what the rumours were according to Will and Rose: that I\u2019d found him in bed with his business partner\u2019s daughter and left. Other than Rose, Dee, Mia, and myself, nobody knew about Will and Terry being together, despite the fact that Terry was all but living in our house. I felt a moment of guilt in telling Harry. It wasn\u2019t my secret to share, but it spilled out anyway,</p><p>\u201cWill and I got into a fight about me not wanting to go to your after party. It got pretty intense so I spent the night at Rose\u2019s.\u201d I paused to take a drink. I hadn\u2019t really spoken about what happened to anyone else, and my throat seemed to be tightening as I remembered pushing the bedroom door open. \u201cI\u2019d decided I was going to go home and tell him that it was over \u2014 that I didn\u2019t want to deal with his shit anymore. I got up early, drove home, and\u2026 and I found him in bed with Terry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerry?!\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes became wide and round like saucers. He went to reach a hand across the table but thankfully stopped himself. \u201cOh, Lil, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerry.\u201d Hands shaking, it was my turn to look for someone to bring another round. Turning back to face Harry, I saw a look of what felt like pity. I knew that would always be the reaction. \"Believe it or not, I\u2019m okay. I feel hurt and betrayed, but they\u2019ve been in love since Will was seventeen or so. Mostly, I feel sad that they felt the need to lie.\u201d</p>",

There were several folders in the office, which were constantly updated, but it certainly helped to know the basics. London had become very popular in terms of city weddings, so there were plenty of brides who had visions of their own magazine-perfect day in the perfect venue. The hotel Harry had chosen was new, but it had quickly become my favourite to recommend to brides who wanted something classic yet fresh. Lots of wooden and copper details, marble staircases and mirrors. I was excited to visit the place again &mdash; I just hoped it wasn&rsquo;t going to be ruined with a new bad memory of Harry. I&rsquo;d already attended a couple of weddings in the other hotels we&rsquo;d stayed in and it had taken everything not to tell my boss I was sick and needed to go home.</p><p>With a huge sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, I knocked on the door with the room number I&rsquo;d been given and waited nervously. Harry answered the door, and it felt just like the first time we&rsquo;d met in a hotel: he was dressed in black skinny jeans and a white tee. His hair was a lot longer than before, but again, there were wet patches where his damp curls lay on his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed as though surprised to see me. I had a moment of panic that I&rsquo;d imagined our plans until he smiled and signalled for me to come in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.

Years of put-downs from Will had left their mark, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe Harry would want me when there was no reason to have me.</p><p>&ldquo;I left Will the day after that show. Did you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Can I ask what happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry knew there was somebody else, but (like everyone else) still assumed it was Mia. That&rsquo;s what the rumours were according to Will and Rose: that I&rsquo;d found him in bed with his business partner&rsquo;s daughter and left. Other than Rose, Dee, Mia, and myself, nobody knew about Will and Terry being together, despite the fact that Terry was all but living in our house. I felt a moment of guilt in telling Harry. It wasn&rsquo;t my secret to share, but it spilled out anyway,</p><p>&ldquo;Will and I got into a fight about me not wanting to go to your after party. It got pretty intense so I spent the night at Rose&rsquo;s.&rdquo; I paused to take a drink. I hadn&rsquo;t really spoken about what happened to anyone else, and my throat seemed to be tightening as I remembered pushing the bedroom door open. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d decided I was going to go home and tell him that it was over &mdash; that I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with his shit anymore. I got up early, drove home, and&hellip; and I found him in bed with Terry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Terry?!&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes became wide and round like saucers. He went to reach a hand across the table but thankfully stopped himself. &ldquo;Oh, Lil, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Terry.&rdquo; Hands shaking, it was my turn to look for someone to bring another round. Turning back to face Harry, I saw a look of what felt like pity. I knew that would always be the reaction. \"Believe it or not, I&rsquo;m okay. I feel hurt and betrayed, but they&rsquo;ve been in love since Will was seventeen or so. Mostly, I feel sad that they felt the need to lie.&rdquo;</p>",

There were several folders in the office, which were constantly updated, but it certainly helped to know the basics. London had become very popular in terms of city weddings, so there were plenty of brides who had visions of their own magazine-perfect day in the perfect venue. The hotel Harry had chosen was new, but it had quickly become my favourite to recommend to brides who wanted something classic yet fresh. Lots of wooden and copper details, marble staircases and mirrors. I was excited to visit the place again &mdash; I just hoped it wasn&rsquo;t going to be ruined with a new bad memory of Harry. I&rsquo;d already attended a couple of weddings in the other hotels we&rsquo;d stayed in and it had taken everything not to tell my boss I was sick and needed to go home.</p>\n<p>With a huge sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, I knocked on the door with the room number I&rsquo;d been given and waited nervously. Harry answered the door, and it felt just like the first time we&rsquo;d met in a hotel: he was dressed in black skinny jeans and a white tee. His hair was a lot longer than before, but again, there were wet patches where his damp curls lay on his shoulders.</p>\n</p>",

Then again, it wasn&rsquo;t really caving in, but merely being open to a conversation \u2014 even Will got that. My eyes went to everything in the room except my phone, convincing myself that if I didn&rsquo;t look at it, he would reply sooner.</p><p>If he even replied at all. His messages may have been the result of a few too many, and in the morning, he&rsquo;d wake up filled with regret. Once again, I had fallen for it oh-so-easily.</p><p>I nearly screamed with relief when the phone lit up, but that relief was short-lived when I realised that Harry hadn&rsquo;t replied to my text. He was calling me. The screen no longer said &lsquo;Stella&rsquo; as it had during our affair, and I liked seeing his name pop up. I reached for the phone, and with a split-second&rsquo;s hesitation, I finally answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m awake.&rdquo; Hearing Harry speak was enough to bring my heart to my throat. I was determined not to let his actions slide, but I missed him and would have done anything to have him there with me. &ldquo;What are you doing up so late?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep and I&rsquo;m drunk,&rdquo; I replied, glad I had been drinking so I didn&rsquo;t feel so nervous. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a room,&rdquo; he answered before adding quickly, &ldquo;in Atlanta. Drinking on a school night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I spent the day with Will. We told his mother about the divorce and then drank a lot.&rdquo; Cringing at the casual mention of my divorce, I tried to follow it brightly with my basic knowledge of time differences. &ldquo;You have a show tonight, then? How&rsquo;re the nerves?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we go on in a little. I&rsquo;m more nervous making this phone call if I&rsquo;m honest. I&hellip;&rdquo; he paused and took a deep breath, &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m in shock that you actually replied to me, but I&rsquo;m sad we can&rsquo;t talk for long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I understand.&rdquo; Laying down and closing my eyes, I pretended for the first time in almost a year that Harry was next to me. &ldquo;I nearly didn&rsquo;t, but you caught me in a forgiving mood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, can we meet when I come back? I&rsquo;ll only be in London for a couple of days, but I&rsquo;d really like to talk. Also, I got you something for your birthday and I&rsquo;d like to give it to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Having gotten used to nobody but Rose remembering or caring much about my birthday, I was thrown off track a little. We had spent my thirtieth together and he had made it so special, but with how things had gone afterwards, I had convinced myself that it hadn&rsquo;t meant the same to him. I hadn&rsquo;t expected him to remember it, certainly not to use it as a reason why he wanted to meet up, and certainly not weeks after. Turning thirty-one had felt important to me \u2014 the first birthday in my new house and as a single woman on my own \u2014 but it was nothing to anyone else. Harry remembering it enough to get me a gift made my tummy flutter and I softened to him further.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, we can meet,&rdquo; I sighed, ignoring the usual excitement I got at the prospect of seeing him. &ldquo;I would invite you 'round to mine, but I&rsquo;m still in the decorating stages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have your own place? I could help decorate. I can hold your ladder or something,&rdquo; he chuckled suggestively.</p><p>Feeling my cheeks warm, I bit my lip and suppressed the urge to giggle at his flirtation. I had to remain strong, to at least present myself as somewhat resistant to his charms and not so easily won over as I had been. It was easy to let myself get swept up in how much I wanted Harry, especially when I was lonely and sad or in need of reminding I was worth more than what Will made me think I was. But Harry had hurt me, too, and I needed him to know that before I considered forgiving him. As if reading my thoughts, his tone became serious and he gave me the apology I needed.</p><p>&ldquo;Lil, I&rsquo;m sorry for what I did. It was immature and I regret it. I panicked that I was feeling more for you than you were for me.&rdquo; Scoffing, he muttered, &ldquo;me and my bruised ego.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. I was drunk and still bruised both emotionally and mentally by everything that had happened in the past year, but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to return his vulnerability. My soul felt fragile, as though I was walking around protecting it from any harm and Harry was the one person who could hurt it further. There had been a point where I allowed myself to think that I loved him, too, but he had sent that thought scurrying back into the deep recesses of my brain the moment he blocked my number. He hadn&rsquo;t done that by accident, but a conscious decision \u2014 he had chosen her over me.</p><p>&ldquo;We can talk about it more when we meet, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. I mean, of course!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Sensing he&rsquo;d found my diplomatic reply cold, I felt guilty. It had probably taken a lot for him to swallow his pride and apologise. I knew it would have been hard for me at that age, no matter how guilty I felt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m drunk and it&rsquo;s late. I didn&rsquo;t expect that we&rsquo;d end up talking, or that you&rsquo;d say sorry. I&rsquo;ve had a crazy few months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Layla, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he reassured, voice low and soft. &ldquo;I just wanted to say sorry. We can talk about it more another time. I&rsquo;ll book us a room and we can be alone.&rdquo;</p><p>At the mention meeting at a hotel, I felt myself bristle at the suggestion, instantly needing to remind him that just because we were talking and I&rsquo;d agreed to meet, things were not just going back to how they&rsquo;d been before. Logically, I knew a hotel was the best option, but I didn&rsquo;t want to give him the impression that I was going to drop my knickers the minute I walked through that door, if at all. He was going to have to do more than just flash his dimples, say some platitudes, and charm me into bed.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just meeting to talk. You know that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The stern tone that came from my mouth took me by surprise, but I made no effort to apologise for it this time.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, Lil. Will a conference room be okay?&rdquo; he asked, cheekily.</p><p>I could hear muffled voices in the background, including Harry&rsquo;s as he moved the phone away from his mouth. I yawned and waited for him to return, tempted to counter his cheekiness by telling him our meeting was off. Clearing his throat, I heard him clearly again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, just been told I need to go,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;but I know we&rsquo;re just meeting to talk, baby. I just want us to have privacy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, just let me know when and where and I&rsquo;ll make sure I&rsquo;m free.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I caught you in the right mood.&rdquo; I could hear the smile in his words, and it made me smile too. &ldquo;Sleep well, Lil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a good show, Harry. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>\u2022</p><p>Waking up, I&rsquo;d thought for a moment that the conversation with Harry had been a dream stemming from my imaginary arguments with him. That was until I saw a message which had been sent after his show apologising for having to rush off, and wishing me a good day when I woke up. That had woken me up properly and had me calling Rose to see if she was free for breakfast. I needed greasy food and advice from my friend.</p><p>I arrived to the cafe before her seeing as it wasn&rsquo;t far from my house and managed to bag us a window seat. As I waited for her to arrive, I sipped my tea and hoped my hangover got no worse. I could handle the slight nausea and the occasional haunting taste of whiskey. I just didn&rsquo;t want to be sick or develop a headache.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, bird!&rdquo; Rose greeted me with a grin, loudly pulling out the seat opposite me and plopping herself into it. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the head?&rdquo;</p><p>Looking up from my tea, I gave her the finger and gave a sarcastically sweet smile. &ldquo;Fine, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>She grinned at me sympathetically, shrugging off her brightly coloured coat and picking up the laminated menu. &ldquo;That was Dee last Saturday. She was as sick as a dog.&rdquo;</p><p>Rose&rsquo;s expression turned soft as her gaze drifted over the list of greasy food. I knew that she&rsquo;d seen Dee vomit. That was her measure for love \u2014 \u00a0if she could handle a person&rsquo;s retches and all the other lovely things that come with puking after too much to drink, it was love. She&rsquo;d held my hair back on many occasions, and I&rsquo;d done the same for her, but it was the usually followed with a week of mickey-taking and reenacting of noises. There was none of that now. Rose just simply rolled her eyes with affection and declared she was going to have a full English breakfast.</p><p>As we waited for the waitress to bring over Rose&rsquo;s tea, I filled her in on what had happened with Verity and Will, and she proceeded to tell me off for drinking with him. Understandably, she was still furious with him and was thoroughly enjoying finally being able to tell me what she really thought of him (&ldquo;wankbasket,&rdquo; &ldquo;toffee-nosed bellend,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arse-faced, knob-cheesing, bullying poshboy!&rdquo; being just some of my favourites). However I was relieved I had a distraction from her annoyance up my sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I had an interesting conversation last night,&rdquo; I spoke with a casual air as I poured sugar into my fresh mug of tea and waited to see if she&rsquo;d guess. When she didn&rsquo;t, I continued. &ldquo;Harry messaged me.&rdquo;</p><p>Gasping in shock as she sipped her tea, Rose started to cough and splutter, the hot liquid having been rapidly sucked to the back of her throat. I waited for her to regain her composure, feeling slightly guilty for nearly causing her to choke. Red-faced, she patted her chest and signalled for me to continue. As she took another gulp of tea, I hoped this time it didn&rsquo;t come shooting across the table at me.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m meeting with him the next time he&rsquo;s in London, in a week or two.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, food arrived so we busied ourselves with sauces and buttering toast. The first bite of food was heaven-sent and exactly what I needed to ease the horrible swirling in my stomach. As I piled sausage, beans, and scrambled egg onto my fork and into my mouth, I felt life return to my cheeks. We ate in silence for a few minutes, both of us hungry and needing to fill a gap before we continued with our conversation. Feeling somewhat sated, Rose spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;So, is a reconciliation on the cards? You&rsquo;re both single now. There&rsquo;s nothing stopping you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I shrugged, picking up a piece of toast and chewing it thoughtfully. &ldquo;He apologised for what he did, but with everything else going on, I&rsquo;m not sure I need the hassle.&rdquo;</p><p>She mirrored my shrug and clicked her tongue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough one, I&rsquo;ll give you that. My really lame and not very helpful advice is that you have to do what&rsquo;s best for you. Meet with Harry, see how it goes, and if it isn&rsquo;t one hundred percent what you want, give him the boot.&rdquo;</p><p>I looked out of the steamed up window at the blurry people walking by. It had started to rain, and the morning was blue and gloomy, heavy with the impending arrival of winter just around the corner. It had crossed my mind that Harry and I might not click anymore, the excitement of clandestine meetings and whispered secrets having given us a false sense of a shared connection.</p><p>&ldquo;So you think I should meet him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Best case scenario: he&rsquo;s the love of your life and you&rsquo;ll end up living happily ever after. Worst case scenario: he breaks your heart again, but after some great sex.&rdquo; Once again, she shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking my head, I finished my tea and watched as Rose mopped up bean juice with a slice of bread.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the harm, indeed.&rdquo;</p>",

Logically, I knew a hotel was the best option, but I didn\u2019t want to give him the impression that I was going to drop my knickers the minute I walked through that door, if at all. He was going to have to do more than just flash his dimples, say some platitudes, and charm me into bed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just meeting to talk. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d The stern tone that came from my mouth took me by surprise, but I made no effort to apologise for it this time.</p><p>\u201cI know, Lil. Will a conference room be okay?\u201d he asked, cheekily.</p><p>I could hear muffled voices in the background, including Harry\u2019s as he moved the phone away from his mouth. I yawned and waited for him to return, tempted to counter his cheekiness by telling him our meeting was off. Clearing his throat, I heard him clearly again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, just been told I need to go,\u201d he said sadly, \u201cbut I know we\u2019re just meeting to talk, baby. I just want us to have privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, just let me know when and where and I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I caught you in the right mood.\u201d I could hear the smile in his words, and it made me smile too. \u201cSleep well, Lil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good show, Harry. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u2022</p><p>Waking up, I\u2019d thought for a moment that the conversation with Harry had been a dream stemming from my imaginary arguments with him. That was until I saw a message which had been sent after his show apologising for having to rush off, and wishing me a good day when I woke up. That had woken me up properly and had me calling Rose to see if she was free for breakfast.

She was as sick as a dog.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s expression turned soft as her gaze drifted over the list of greasy food. I knew that she\u2019d seen Dee vomit.

Rose just simply rolled her eyes with affection and declared she was going to have a full English breakfast.</p><p>As we waited for the waitress to bring over Rose\u2019s tea, I filled her in on what had happened with Verity and Will, and she proceeded to tell me off for drinking with him. Understandably, she was still furious with him and was thoroughly enjoying finally being able to tell me what she really thought of him (\u201cwankbasket,\u201d \u201ctoffee-nosed bellend,\u201d and \u201carse-faced, knob-cheesing, bullying poshboy!\u201d being just some of my favourites). However I was relieved I had a distraction from her annoyance up my sleeve.</p><p>\u201cSo, I had an interesting conversation last night,\u201d I spoke with a casual air as I poured sugar into my fresh mug of tea and waited to see if she\u2019d guess. When she didn\u2019t, I continued. \u201cHarry messaged me.\u201d</p><p>Gasping in shock as she sipped her tea, Rose started to cough and splutter, the hot liquid having been rapidly sucked to the back of her throat. I waited for her to regain her composure, feeling slightly guilty for nearly causing her to choke. Red-faced, she patted her chest and signalled for me to continue. As she took another gulp of tea, I hoped this time it didn\u2019t come shooting across the table at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting with him the next time he\u2019s in London, in a week or two.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, food arrived so we busied ourselves with sauces and buttering toast. The first bite of food was heaven-sent and exactly what I needed to ease the horrible swirling in my stomach. As I piled sausage, beans, and scrambled egg onto my fork and into my mouth, I felt life return to my cheeks. We ate in silence for a few minutes, both of us hungry and needing to fill a gap before we continued with our conversation. Feeling somewhat sated, Rose spoke up.</p><p>\u201cSo, is a reconciliation on the cards? You\u2019re both single now. There\u2019s nothing stopping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know,\u201d I shrugged, picking up a piece of toast and chewing it thoughtfully. \u201cHe apologised for what he did, but with everything else going on, I\u2019m not sure I need the hassle.\u201d</p><p>She mirrored my shrug and clicked her tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one, I\u2019ll give you that. My really lame and not very helpful advice is that you have to do what\u2019s best for you. Meet with Harry, see how it goes, and if it isn\u2019t one hundred percent what you want, give him the boot.\u201d</p><p>I looked out of the steamed up window at the blurry people walking by. It had started to rain, and the morning was blue and gloomy, heavy with the impending arrival of winter just around the corner. It had crossed my mind that Harry and I might not click anymore, the excitement of clandestine meetings and whispered secrets having given us a false sense of a shared connection.</p><p>\u201cSo you think I should meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest case scenario: he\u2019s the love of your life and you\u2019ll end up living happily ever after. Worst case scenario: he breaks your heart again, but after some great sex.\u201d Once again, she shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I finished my tea and watched as Rose mopped up bean juice with a slice of bread.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the harm, indeed.\u201d</p>",

Every time I closed my eyes, the room would spin and I\u2019d have to grip the bed covers for fear of spinning out of control. I just lay in the dark and stared up at the Artex ceiling while having imaginary conversations with Harry until I started losing my own argument and rolled over to switch my bedside lamp back on. Picking up my phone, I opened up numerous apps and scrolled through various websites hoping to get some decor ideas. Paint colours, wallpaper patterns, and fluffy fabrics had become my biggest distractions from life, but my thoughts were somewhere else \u2014 mainly wherever Harry was.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, I opened his messages and watched myself type and send,</p><p><b>Layla</b><br><i>Are you awake?</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Realising what I had just done, I threw my phone to the bottom of the bed while my knees shot up to my chest and I wrapped my arms around calves. I groaned loudly and regretted every single life decision which had lead to this one. I was annoyed I\u2019d caved in so easily. Then again, it wasn\u2019t really caving in, but merely being open to a conversation \u2014 even Will got that. My eyes went to everything in the room except my phone, convincing myself that if I didn\u2019t look at it, he would reply sooner.</p><p>If he even replied at all. His messages may have been the result of a few too many, and in the morning, he\u2019d wake up filled with regret. Once again, I had fallen for it oh-so-easily.</p><p>I nearly screamed with relief when the phone lit up, but that relief was short-lived when I realised that Harry hadn\u2019t replied to my text. He was calling me. The screen no longer said \u2018Stella\u2019 as it had during our affair, and I liked seeing his name pop up. I reached for the phone, and with a split-second\u2019s hesitation, I finally answered.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m awake.\u201d Hearing Harry speak was enough to bring my heart to my throat. I was determined not to let his actions slide, but I missed him and would have done anything to have him there with me. \u201cWhat are you doing up so late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m drunk,\u201d I replied, glad I had been drinking so I didn\u2019t feel so nervous. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a room,\u201d he answered before adding quickly, \u201cin Atlanta. Drinking on a school night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent the day with Will. We told his mother about the divorce and then drank a lot.\u201d Cringing at the casual mention of my divorce, I tried to follow it brightly with my basic knowledge of time differences. \u201cYou have a show tonight, then? How\u2019re the nerves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we go on in a little. I\u2019m more nervous making this phone call if I\u2019m honest. I\u2026\u201d he paused and took a deep breath, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m in shock that you actually replied to me, but I\u2019m sad we can\u2019t talk for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand.\u201d Laying down and closing my eyes, I pretended for the first time in almost a year that Harry was next to me. \u201cI nearly didn\u2019t, but you caught me in a forgiving mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, can we meet when I come back? I\u2019ll only be in London for a couple of days, but I\u2019d really like to talk. Also, I got you something for your birthday and I\u2019d like to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Having gotten used to nobody but Rose remembering or caring much about my birthday, I was thrown off track a little. We had spent my thirtieth together and he had made it so special, but with how things had gone afterwards, I had convinced myself that it hadn\u2019t meant the same to him. I hadn\u2019t expected him to remember it, certainly not to use it as a reason why he wanted to meet up, and certainly not weeks after. Turning thirty-one had felt important to me \u2014 the first birthday in my new house and as a single woman on my own \u2014 but it was nothing to anyone else. Harry remembering it enough to get me a gift made my tummy flutter and I softened to him further.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we can meet,\u201d I sighed, ignoring the usual excitement I got at the prospect of seeing him. \u201cI would invite you 'round to mine, but I\u2019m still in the decorating stages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your own place? I could help decorate. I can hold your ladder or something,\u201d he chuckled suggestively.</p><p>Feeling my cheeks warm, I bit my lip and suppressed the urge to giggle at his flirtation. I had to remain strong, to at least present myself as somewhat resistant to his charms and not so easily won over as I had been. It was easy to let myself get swept up in how much I wanted Harry, especially when I was lonely and sad or in need of reminding I was worth more than what Will made me think I was. But Harry had hurt me, too, and I needed him to know that before I considered forgiving him. As if reading my thoughts, his tone became serious and he gave me the apology I needed.</p><p>\u201cLil, I\u2019m sorry for what I did. It was immature and I regret it. I panicked that I was feeling more for you than you were for me.\u201d Scoffing, he muttered, \u201cme and my bruised ego.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was drunk and still bruised both emotionally and mentally by everything that had happened in the past year, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to return his vulnerability. My soul felt fragile, as though I was walking around protecting it from any harm and Harry was the one person who could hurt it further. There had been a point where I allowed myself to think that I loved him, too, but he had sent that thought scurrying back into the deep recesses of my brain the moment he blocked my number. He hadn\u2019t done that by accident, but a conscious decision \u2014 he had chosen her over me.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it more when we meet, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. I mean, of course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sensing he\u2019d found my diplomatic reply cold, I felt guilty. It had probably taken a lot for him to swallow his pride and apologise. I knew it would have been hard for me at that age, no matter how guilty I felt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m drunk and it\u2019s late. I didn\u2019t expect that we\u2019d end up talking, or that you\u2019d say sorry. I\u2019ve had a crazy few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLayla, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he reassured, voice low and soft. \u201cI just wanted to say sorry. We can talk about it more another time. I\u2019ll book us a room and we can be alone.\u201d</p><p>At the mention meeting at a hotel, I felt myself bristle at the suggestion, instantly needing to remind him that just because we were talking and I\u2019d agreed to meet, things were not just going back to how they\u2019d been before. Logically, I knew a hotel was the best option, but I didn\u2019t want to give him the impression that I was going to drop my knickers the minute I walked through that door, if at all. He was going to have to do more than just flash his dimples, say some platitudes, and charm me into bed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just meeting to talk. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d The stern tone that came from my mouth took me by surprise, but I made no effort to apologise for it this time.</p><p>\u201cI know, Lil. Will a conference room be okay?\u201d he asked, cheekily.</p><p>I could hear muffled voices in the background, including Harry\u2019s as he moved the phone away from his mouth. I yawned and waited for him to return, tempted to counter his cheekiness by telling him our meeting was off. Clearing his throat, I heard him clearly again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, just been told I need to go,\u201d he said sadly, \u201cbut I know we\u2019re just meeting to talk, baby. I just want us to have privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, just let me know when and where and I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I caught you in the right mood.\u201d I could hear the smile in his words, and it made me smile too. \u201cSleep well, Lil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good show, Harry. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u2022</p><p>Waking up, I\u2019d thought for a moment that the conversation with Harry had been a dream stemming from my imaginary arguments with him. That was until I saw a message which had been sent after his show apologising for having to rush off, and wishing me a good day when I woke up. That had woken me up properly and had me calling Rose to see if she was free for breakfast. I needed greasy food and advice from my friend.</p><p>I arrived to the cafe before her seeing as it wasn\u2019t far from my house and managed to bag us a window seat. As I waited for her to arrive, I sipped my tea and hoped my hangover got no worse. I could handle the slight nausea and the occasional haunting taste of whiskey. I just didn\u2019t want to be sick or develop a headache.</p><p>\u201cAlright, bird!\u201d Rose greeted me with a grin, loudly pulling out the seat opposite me and plopping herself into it. \u201cHow\u2019s the head?\u201d</p><p>Looking up from my tea, I gave her the finger and gave a sarcastically sweet smile. \u201cFine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at me sympathetically, shrugging off her brightly coloured coat and picking up the laminated menu. \u201cThat was Dee last Saturday. She was as sick as a dog.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s expression turned soft as her gaze drifted over the list of greasy food. I knew that she\u2019d seen Dee vomit. That was her measure for love \u2014 \u00a0if she could handle a person\u2019s retches and all the other lovely things that come with puking after too much to drink, it was love. She\u2019d held my hair back on many occasions, and I\u2019d done the same for her, but it was the usually followed with a week of mickey-taking and reenacting of noises. There was none of that now. Rose just simply rolled her eyes with affection and declared she was going to have a full English breakfast.</p><p>As we waited for the waitress to bring over Rose\u2019s tea, I filled her in on what had happened with Verity and Will, and she proceeded to tell me off for drinking with him. Understandably, she was still furious with him and was thoroughly enjoying finally being able to tell me what she really thought of him (\u201cwankbasket,\u201d \u201ctoffee-nosed bellend,\u201d and \u201carse-faced, knob-cheesing, bullying poshboy!\u201d being just some of my favourites). However I was relieved I had a distraction from her annoyance up my sleeve.</p><p>\u201cSo, I had an interesting conversation last night,\u201d I spoke with a casual air as I poured sugar into my fresh mug of tea and waited to see if she\u2019d guess. When she didn\u2019t, I continued. \u201cHarry messaged me.\u201d</p><p>Gasping in shock as she sipped her tea, Rose started to cough and splutter, the hot liquid having been rapidly sucked to the back of her throat. I waited for her to regain her composure, feeling slightly guilty for nearly causing her to choke. Red-faced, she patted her chest and signalled for me to continue. As she took another gulp of tea, I hoped this time it didn\u2019t come shooting across the table at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting with him the next time he\u2019s in London, in a week or two.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, food arrived so we busied ourselves with sauces and buttering toast. The first bite of food was heaven-sent and exactly what I needed to ease the horrible swirling in my stomach. As I piled sausage, beans, and scrambled egg onto my fork and into my mouth, I felt life return to my cheeks. We ate in silence for a few minutes, both of us hungry and needing to fill a gap before we continued with our conversation. Feeling somewhat sated, Rose spoke up.</p><p>\u201cSo, is a reconciliation on the cards? You\u2019re both single now. There\u2019s nothing stopping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know,\u201d I shrugged, picking up a piece of toast and chewing it thoughtfully. \u201cHe apologised for what he did, but with everything else going on, I\u2019m not sure I need the hassle.\u201d</p><p>She mirrored my shrug and clicked her tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one, I\u2019ll give you that. My really lame and not very helpful advice is that you have to do what\u2019s best for you. Meet with Harry, see how it goes, and if it isn\u2019t one hundred percent what you want, give him the boot.\u201d</p><p>I looked out of the steamed up window at the blurry people walking by. It had started to rain, and the morning was blue and gloomy, heavy with the impending arrival of winter just around the corner. It had crossed my mind that Harry and I might not click anymore, the excitement of clandestine meetings and whispered secrets having given us a false sense of a shared connection.</p><p>\u201cSo you think I should meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest case scenario: he\u2019s the love of your life and you\u2019ll end up living happily ever after. Worst case scenario: he breaks your heart again, but after some great sex.\u201d Once again, she shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I finished my tea and watched as Rose mopped up bean juice with a slice of bread.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the harm, indeed.\u201d</p>",

Every time I closed my eyes, the room would spin and I&rsquo;d have to grip the bed covers for fear of spinning out of control. I just lay in the dark and stared up at the Artex ceiling while having imaginary conversations with Harry until I started losing my own argument and rolled over to switch my bedside lamp back on. Picking up my phone, I opened up numerous apps and scrolled through various websites hoping to get some decor ideas. Paint colours, wallpaper patterns, and fluffy fabrics had become my biggest distractions from life, but my thoughts were somewhere else &mdash; mainly wherever Harry was.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, I opened his messages and watched myself type and send,</p><p><b>Layla</b><br /><i>Are you awake?</i></p><p>Realising what I had just done, I threw my phone to the bottom of the bed while my knees shot up to my chest and I wrapped my arms around calves. I groaned loudly and regretted every single life decision which had lead to this one. I was annoyed I&rsquo;d caved in so easily. Then again, it wasn&rsquo;t really caving in, but merely being open to a conversation &mdash; even Will got that. My eyes went to everything in the room except my phone, convincing myself that if I didn&rsquo;t look at it, he would reply sooner.</p><p>If he even replied at all. His messages may have been the result of a few too many, and in the morning, he&rsquo;d wake up filled with regret. Once again, I had fallen for it oh-so-easily.</p><p>I nearly screamed with relief when the phone lit up, but that relief was short-lived when I realised that Harry hadn&rsquo;t replied to my text. He was calling me. The screen no longer said &lsquo;Stella&rsquo; as it had during our affair, and I liked seeing his name pop up. I reached for the phone, and with a split-second&rsquo;s hesitation, I finally answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m awake.&rdquo; Hearing Harry speak was enough to bring my heart to my throat. I was determined not to let his actions slide, but I missed him and would have done anything to have him there with me. &ldquo;What are you doing up so late?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep and I&rsquo;m drunk,&rdquo; I replied, glad I had been drinking so I didn&rsquo;t feel so nervous. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a room,&rdquo; he answered before adding quickly, &ldquo;in Atlanta. Drinking on a school night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I spent the day with Will. We told his mother about the divorce and then drank a lot.&rdquo; Cringing at the casual mention of my divorce, I tried to follow it brightly with my basic knowledge of time differences. &ldquo;You have a show tonight, then? How&rsquo;re the nerves?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we go on in a little. I&rsquo;m more nervous making this phone call if I&rsquo;m honest. I&hellip;&rdquo; he paused and took a deep breath, &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m in shock that you actually replied to me, but I&rsquo;m sad we can&rsquo;t talk for long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I understand.&rdquo; Laying down and closing my eyes, I pretended for the first time in almost a year that Harry was next to me. &ldquo;I nearly didn&rsquo;t, but you caught me in a forgiving mood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, can we meet when I come back? I&rsquo;ll only be in London for a couple of days, but I&rsquo;d really like to talk. Also, I got you something for your birthday and I&rsquo;d like to give it to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Having gotten used to nobody but Rose remembering or caring much about my birthday, I was thrown off track a little. We had spent my thirtieth together and he had made it so special, but with how things had gone afterwards, I had convinced myself that it hadn&rsquo;t meant the same to him. I hadn&rsquo;t expected him to remember it, certainly not to use it as a reason why he wanted to meet up, and certainly not weeks after. Turning thirty-one had felt important to me &mdash; the first birthday in my new house and as a single woman on my own &mdash; but it was nothing to anyone else. Harry remembering it enough to get me a gift made my tummy flutter and I softened to him further.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, we can meet,&rdquo; I sighed, ignoring the usual excitement I got at the prospect of seeing him. &ldquo;I would invite you 'round to mine, but I&rsquo;m still in the decorating stages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have your own place? I could help decorate. I can hold your ladder or something,&rdquo; he chuckled suggestively.</p><p>Feeling my cheeks warm, I bit my lip and suppressed the urge to giggle at his flirtation. I had to remain strong, to at least present myself as somewhat resistant to his charms and not so easily won over as I had been. It was easy to let myself get swept up in how much I wanted Harry, especially when I was lonely and sad or in need of reminding I was worth more than what Will made me think I was. But Harry had hurt me, too, and I needed him to know that before I considered forgiving him. As if reading my thoughts, his tone became serious and he gave me the apology I needed.</p><p>&ldquo;Lil, I&rsquo;m sorry for what I did. It was immature and I regret it. I panicked that I was feeling more for you than you were for me.&rdquo; Scoffing, he muttered, &ldquo;me and my bruised ego.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. I was drunk and still bruised both emotionally and mentally by everything that had happened in the past year, but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to return his vulnerability. My soul felt fragile, as though I was walking around protecting it from any harm and Harry was the one person who could hurt it further. There had been a point where I allowed myself to think that I loved him, too, but he had sent that thought scurrying back into the deep recesses of my brain the moment he blocked my number. He hadn&rsquo;t done that by accident, but a conscious decision &mdash; he had chosen her over me.</p><p>&ldquo;We can talk about it more when we meet, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. I mean, of course!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Sensing he&rsquo;d found my diplomatic reply cold, I felt guilty. It had probably taken a lot for him to swallow his pride and apologise. I knew it would have been hard for me at that age, no matter how guilty I felt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m drunk and it&rsquo;s late. I didn&rsquo;t expect that we&rsquo;d end up talking, or that you&rsquo;d say sorry. I&rsquo;ve had a crazy few months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Layla, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he reassured, voice low and soft. &ldquo;I just wanted to say sorry. We can talk about it more another time. I&rsquo;ll book us a room and we can be alone.&rdquo;</p><p>At the mention meeting at a hotel, I felt myself bristle at the suggestion, instantly needing to remind him that just because we were talking and I&rsquo;d agreed to meet, things were not just going back to how they&rsquo;d been before. Logically, I knew a hotel was the best option, but I didn&rsquo;t want to give him the impression that I was going to drop my knickers the minute I walked through that door, if at all. He was going to have to do more than just flash his dimples, say some platitudes, and charm me into bed.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just meeting to talk. You know that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The stern tone that came from my mouth took me by surprise, but I made no effort to apologise for it this time.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, Lil. Will a conference room be okay?&rdquo; he asked, cheekily.</p><p>I could hear muffled voices in the background, including Harry&rsquo;s as he moved the phone away from his mouth. I yawned and waited for him to return, tempted to counter his cheekiness by telling him our meeting was off. Clearing his throat, I heard him clearly again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, just been told I need to go,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;but I know we&rsquo;re just meeting to talk, baby. I just want us to have privacy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, just let me know when and where and I&rsquo;ll make sure I&rsquo;m free.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I caught you in the right mood.&rdquo; I could hear the smile in his words, and it made me smile too. &ldquo;Sleep well, Lil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a good show, Harry. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>&bull;</p><p>Waking up, I&rsquo;d thought for a moment that the conversation with Harry had been a dream stemming from my imaginary arguments with him. That was until I saw a message which had been sent after his show apologising for having to rush off, and wishing me a good day when I woke up. That had woken me up properly and had me calling Rose to see if she was free for breakfast. I needed greasy food and advice from my friend.</p><p>I arrived to the cafe before her seeing as it wasn&rsquo;t far from my house and managed to bag us a window seat. As I waited for her to arrive, I sipped my tea and hoped my hangover got no worse. I could handle the slight nausea and the occasional haunting taste of whiskey. I just didn&rsquo;t want to be sick or develop a headache.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, bird!&rdquo; Rose greeted me with a grin, loudly pulling out the seat opposite me and plopping herself into it. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the head?&rdquo;</p><p>Looking up from my tea, I gave her the finger and gave a sarcastically sweet smile. &ldquo;Fine, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>She grinned at me sympathetically, shrugging off her brightly coloured coat and picking up the laminated menu. &ldquo;That was Dee last Saturday. She was as sick as a dog.&rdquo;</p><p>Rose&rsquo;s expression turned soft as her gaze drifted over the list of greasy food. I knew that she&rsquo;d seen Dee vomit. That was her measure for love &mdash; &nbsp;if she could handle a person&rsquo;s retches and all the other lovely things that come with puking after too much to drink, it was love. She&rsquo;d held my hair back on many occasions, and I&rsquo;d done the same for her, but it was the usually followed with a week of mickey-taking and reenacting of noises. There was none of that now. Rose just simply rolled her eyes with affection and declared she was going to have a full English breakfast.</p><p>As we waited for the waitress to bring over Rose&rsquo;s tea, I filled her in on what had happened with Verity and Will, and she proceeded to tell me off for drinking with him. Understandably, she was still furious with him and was thoroughly enjoying finally being able to tell me what she really thought of him (&ldquo;wankbasket,&rdquo; &ldquo;toffee-nosed bellend,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arse-faced, knob-cheesing, bullying poshboy!&rdquo; being just some of my favourites). However I was relieved I had a distraction from her annoyance up my sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I had an interesting conversation last night,&rdquo; I spoke with a casual air as I poured sugar into my fresh mug of tea and waited to see if she&rsquo;d guess. When she didn&rsquo;t, I continued. &ldquo;Harry messaged me.&rdquo;</p><p>Gasping in shock as she sipped her tea, Rose started to cough and splutter, the hot liquid having been rapidly sucked to the back of her throat. I waited for her to regain her composure, feeling slightly guilty for nearly causing her to choke. Red-faced, she patted her chest and signalled for me to continue. As she took another gulp of tea, I hoped this time it didn&rsquo;t come shooting across the table at me.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m meeting with him the next time he&rsquo;s in London, in a week or two.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, food arrived so we busied ourselves with sauces and buttering toast. The first bite of food was heaven-sent and exactly what I needed to ease the horrible swirling in my stomach. As I piled sausage, beans, and scrambled egg onto my fork and into my mouth, I felt life return to my cheeks. We ate in silence for a few minutes, both of us hungry and needing to fill a gap before we continued with our conversation. Feeling somewhat sated, Rose spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;So, is a reconciliation on the cards? You&rsquo;re both single now. There&rsquo;s nothing stopping you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I shrugged, picking up a piece of toast and chewing it thoughtfully. &ldquo;He apologised for what he did, but with everything else going on, I&rsquo;m not sure I need the hassle.&rdquo;</p><p>She mirrored my shrug and clicked her tongue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough one, I&rsquo;ll give you that. My really lame and not very helpful advice is that you have to do what&rsquo;s best for you. Meet with Harry, see how it goes, and if it isn&rsquo;t one hundred percent what you want, give him the boot.&rdquo;</p><p>I looked out of the steamed up window at the blurry people walking by.

Worst case scenario: he breaks your heart again, but after some great sex.&rdquo; Once again, she shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking my head, I finished my tea and watched as Rose mopped up bean juice with a slice of bread.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the harm, indeed.&rdquo;</p>",

We drove back to her place then walked the short distance to her local pub with day-drinking on the agenda.</p><p>Choosing to sit outside, I sipped my ice cold lemonade and lifted my face to the sun. As I let the warmth wash over me for the first time in what felt like forever, I accepted that nothing was fixed, but the sunshine made me hopeful that everything would work out somehow.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise I&rsquo;ll be out of your hair soon,&rdquo; I sighed, feeling my shoulders relax.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re honestly fine, Lil,&rdquo; Rose replied after taking a large gulp of wine and letting out a satisfied groan. &ldquo;Like I keep saying, stay as long as you need to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, and honestly I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d have done without you in the past month. I just want my own space so I can actually start to move on.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded her understanding and shrugged. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t want to, but maybe you should consider speaking to Will. He owes you somewhere to live at the very least.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>I wasn&rsquo;t entirely against the idea. He&rsquo;d kept me from working and earning my own money, so it made sense that he would at least help out. We hadn&rsquo;t spoken since I&rsquo;d left. I&rsquo;d ignored all his calls, texts, and visits to Rose&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;d even been to my workplace but, thankfully, I&rsquo;d been at a wedding. Rose had been the one who&rsquo;d called to tell him not to come to my office again or his mother would be getting a call from me. He couldn&rsquo;t understand that what I needed was space, but that had been enough for him to get the message, and the barrage eased up to just a single, daily voicemail pleading his case.</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno. I&rsquo;m not that desperate yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then stop stressing yourself out,&rdquo; my friend smiled, pushing her wine glass towards me so I&rsquo;d take a sip. &ldquo;He wants your forgiveness. I&rsquo;d be very surprised if he refused to help.&rdquo;</p><p>I shook my head and gave in, picking up her glass and tasting the ice cold white wine. It was more bitter than I liked, so I reached for the bottle and poured some into my lemonade. I tasted the mix, preferring the now sweeter, refreshing drink, and continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doubtful he&rsquo;d help, but I will try. Just&hellip; Just not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>We sat in silence for a little while, enjoying the chatter of the conversation of the people around us.

On the other end of the line, I heard pages turning as he checked his diary. He had a habit of sticking to keeping appointments and important plans in an old-fashioned book, sticking by the opinion that &lsquo;if it was good enough for my father, it&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m free Monday evening.&rdquo;</p><p>With no enquiry into whether that would be suitable for him, I attempted to start things as I meant to go on. I had spent far too long going by my husband&rsquo;s rules, planning my life around his events and functions, but that wasn&rsquo;t how I wanted to things to be anymore. We would meet on Monday, or not at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; Oh, erm, yes, okay.&rdquo; Sounding suitably thrown off, Will finally sighed. &ldquo;Okay, Monday it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great, see you the\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; he paused before asking, &ldquo;&hellip; What about Terry? Do you want to see him, too?&rdquo;</p><p>Putting my head in my hand, I once again saw their naked bodies tangled in bed, asleep and peaceful. Will and Terry. Two people who, despite trying to get me to talk to them, were probably relieved at finally being able to be together. For all their proclamations of guilt, they were still happy they could sleep in the same bed without fear of me catching them. All while I picked up the scattered shards of my life and tried to put it back together with chewing gum and missing pieces. Did I want to see Terry? I didn&rsquo;t particularly want to see either of them, but for the sake of ripping off the plaster, I thought it best to just get it over with.</p><p>Stomach burning, I answered coldly. &ldquo;I want to go over our marriage, but seeing as it turns out he&rsquo;s been a part of it, then fine.&rdquo;</p><p>I hung up as he started to tell me he was looking forward to us talking. His snivelling and grovelling sickened me. It was false and barely touched the tip when it came to making up for his treatment of me during our marriage. I&rsquo;d been belittled, bullied, and threatened. He&rsquo;d taken advantage of how broken I was, how fragile a person I was, that I lacked guidance from a loving family. There had been nobody to warn me that the rich, handsome, successful man who was giving me attention and lavishing me gifts, might not be all he seemed. No father to warn him that if he hurt me, there&rsquo;d be consequences. No mother to tell me of her own close call with a man who&rsquo;d dazzled her but turned out to be the wrong man. I&rsquo;d taken Will at face value and believed him when he said he loved me.</p><p>When he&rsquo;d proposed, I&rsquo;d never felt happiness like it. I&rsquo;d known it was coming, having found the ring a few days before, but I was still surprised when he got on one knee and asked me to be his wife. I didn&rsquo;t feel worthy of the proposal, genuinely believing that he deserved someone of his own pedigree, someone who also knew the right people and had had the right upbringing. I didn&rsquo;t fit in with his circle. I didn&rsquo;t have my own family estate, or go to school with this person or that. I didn&rsquo;t know how to ride a horse or go hunting. Will had told me that was what he liked about me: I was different and I&rsquo;d lived a real life outside of his world. And I&rsquo;d believed him.</p><p>He used my feelings of unworthiness to his advantage and conducted his affair, knowing it would go unnoticed and unmentioned. I was the perfect cover for his secret \u2014 a secret he didn&rsquo;t want to bury, but just hide so he could continue it without question. For all my loudness and false confidence, he saw that really I was meek and desperate for love. I&rsquo;d wanted to be loved, to be protected, to have the sense of security I&rsquo;d never felt before. For that, I&rsquo;d been easily manipulated into doing as I was told.</p><p>With the marvellous benefit of hindsight, I could see that what Will had liked about me was that I was naive and gullible.</p><p>My thoughts turned to Harry (as they often did ever since my conversation with Rose) and if I would&rsquo;ve had the courage to leave my marriage before I met him. I&rsquo;d been jaded by the way I&rsquo;d been treated, unsurprised and accepting that that was just the way my husband was, but had I been strong enough to leave? To get a job, even?</p><p>It riled me to give credit to him. His behaviour had left him unworthy of that credit, but as much as I hated it, he had been the beginning of a change in me. He had made me stronger, allowing me to see myself in a new, better light. Despite my weakness for him, he had given me a strength and belief that maybe I didn&rsquo;t have to just sit back and accept being someone&rsquo;s doormat. I was better than that.</p><p>(The irony hadn&rsquo;t escaped me that Harry had then proceeded to walk all over me himself.)</p><p>Regardless, Harry had made me feel good \u2014 amazing, in fact \u2014 and had I not been given the reminder that I could feel that way, it was likely I&rsquo;d have stayed put. Not acting as a cover for two people I loved who couldn&rsquo;t be together openly, but because I was too scared to leave.</p>",

He\u2019d kept me from working and earning my own money, so it made sense that he would at least help out. We hadn\u2019t spoken since I\u2019d left. I\u2019d ignored all his calls, texts, and visits to Rose\u2019s. He\u2019d even been to my workplace but, thankfully, I\u2019d been at a wedding. Rose had been the one who\u2019d called to tell him not to come to my office again or his mother would be getting a call from me. He couldn\u2019t understand that what I needed was space, but that had been enough for him to get the message, and the barrage eased up to just a single, daily voicemail pleading his case.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. I\u2019m not that desperate yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop stressing yourself out,\u201d my friend smiled, pushing her wine glass towards me so I\u2019d take a sip. \u201cHe wants your forgiveness. I\u2019d be very surprised if he refused to help.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and gave in, picking up her glass and tasting the ice cold white wine. It was more bitter than I liked, so I reached for the bottle and poured some into my lemonade. I tasted the mix, preferring the now sweeter, refreshing drink, and continued. \u201cI\u2019m doubtful he\u2019d help, but I will try. Just\u2026 Just not yet.\u201d</p><p>We sat in silence for a little while, enjoying the chatter of the conversation of the people around us.

We drove back to her place then walked the short distance to her local pub with day-drinking on the agenda.</p><p>Choosing to sit outside, I sipped my ice cold lemonade and lifted my face to the sun. As I let the warmth wash over me for the first time in what felt like forever, I accepted that nothing was fixed, but the sunshine made me hopeful that everything would work out somehow.</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll be out of your hair soon,\u201d I sighed, feeling my shoulders relax.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re honestly fine, Lil,\u201d Rose replied after taking a large gulp of wine and letting out a satisfied groan. \u201cLike I keep saying, stay as long as you need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and honestly I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done without you in the past month. I just want my own space so I can actually start to move on.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her understanding and shrugged. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to, but maybe you should consider speaking to Will. He owes you somewhere to live at the very least.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>I wasn\u2019t entirely against the idea. He\u2019d kept me from working and earning my own money, so it made sense that he would at least help out. We hadn\u2019t spoken since I\u2019d left. I\u2019d ignored all his calls, texts, and visits to Rose\u2019s. He\u2019d even been to my workplace but, thankfully, I\u2019d been at a wedding. Rose had been the one who\u2019d called to tell him not to come to my office again or his mother would be getting a call from me. He couldn\u2019t understand that what I needed was space, but that had been enough for him to get the message, and the barrage eased up to just a single, daily voicemail pleading his case.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. I\u2019m not that desperate yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop stressing yourself out,\u201d my friend smiled, pushing her wine glass towards me so I\u2019d take a sip. \u201cHe wants your forgiveness. I\u2019d be very surprised if he refused to help.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and gave in, picking up her glass and tasting the ice cold white wine. It was more bitter than I liked, so I reached for the bottle and poured some into my lemonade. I tasted the mix, preferring the now sweeter, refreshing drink, and continued. \u201cI\u2019m doubtful he\u2019d help, but I will try. Just\u2026 Just not yet.\u201d</p><p>We sat in silence for a little while, enjoying the chatter of the conversation of the people around us. I checked my phone and was considering messaging Will to sort out a time to meet when Rose spoke.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she started nervously. I looked up at her and knew there was something coming and I wasn\u2019t going to like it. \u201cI ran into Harry last night.\u201d</p><p>Trying to pretend I wasn\u2019t bothered, I nodded for her to continue. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 He asked how you were and said that he missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d My heart was thumping hard in my chest. I couldn\u2019t let myself believe he did miss me, but the fact he\u2019d said it to her was a comfort. \u201cDid you tell him about me and Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he said he\u2019d heard rumours you weren\u2019t together but wasn\u2019t sure if they were true or not.\u201d She was holding back something and I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I wanted to know what it was.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we talked for quite a while and \u2014 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually saying this \u2014 I think you should contact him.\u201d I stared at her, mouth agape in shock. \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah! I know! I\u2019ve spent the entire time calling him a shitbag, but I think he really has feelings for you, Layla.\u201c I let out a snort, but she continued. \"Honestly, I kept trying to walk away from him because I had work to do, but he wouldn\u2019t bloody let me! Even if I did manage to get away, once I was back in his reach, he\u2019d corner me again and ask a billion questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is Rose, he knows where I am. He knows I\u2019m not with Will. If he was really that interested, he\u2019d have called to see if the rumours were true.\u201d Feeling the positivity I\u2019d felt slipping away, I reached inside my bag to grab my purse. I needed more wine. \u201cAnother bottle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil\u2014\u201d I could see her concern that she\u2019d pissed me off and her regret of even telling me about their conversation. I wasn\u2019t pissed off \u2014 I was worried by how easy it would be to just fall into his life again if given half the chance.</p><p>\u201cI just need to sort my life out before I contemplate dealing with Harry, who \u2014 if I may remind you \u2014 told me he loved me then disappeared to shag a supermodel.\u201d Standing up, I shrugged my shoulders and let out a long, tired sigh. \u201cMaybe in a month or two, but for now I just need a night off from thinking and finding somewhere to live.\u201d</p><p>\u2022</p><p>\u201cWill French speaking.\u201d</p><p>Hearing my husband\u2019s voice made me pause. He sounded formal and business-like, not knowing who was on the other end. I\u2019d called his direct line at the office, knowing the extension number off by heart. I\u2019d hoped he wouldn\u2019t answer the call, that he was in a meeting or with a client, but to my dismay he picked up the call on the third ring. Meaning that I would finally have to hold a conversation with him, and finally arrange when we could meet to discuss the future of our marriage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Layla.\u201d Voice clipped, I\u2019d spent the previous hour rehearsing what I would say and trying my best not to sound nervous.</p><p>\u201cLayla!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you called. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and doodled my anxiety in the margins of the notepad I\u2019d written my script in. Archimedes spirals and cubes with thick, heavy lines distracted my hands temporarily and eased the shake as I spoke.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, I\u2019ve been better, William,\u201d I replied tartly, annoyed at his cheek of pretending like he gave a shit how I was. \u201cAnyway, I guess it\u2019s about time we meet up and talk about where we go from here.\u201d</p><p>Will cleared his throat, and went silent. On the other end of the line, I heard pages turning as he checked his diary. He had a habit of sticking to keeping appointments and important plans in an old-fashioned book, sticking by the opinion that \u2018if it was good enough for my father, it\u2019s good enough for me.\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free Monday evening.\u201d</p><p>With no enquiry into whether that would be suitable for him, I attempted to start things as I meant to go on. I had spent far too long going by my husband\u2019s rules, planning my life around his events and functions, but that wasn\u2019t how I wanted to things to be anymore. We would meet on Monday, or not at all.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Oh, erm, yes, okay.\u201d Sounding suitably thrown off, Will finally sighed. \u201cOkay, Monday it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, see you the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he paused before asking, \u201c\u2026 What about Terry? Do you want to see him, too?\u201d</p><p>Putting my head in my hand, I once again saw their naked bodies tangled in bed, asleep and peaceful. Will and Terry. Two people who, despite trying to get me to talk to them, were probably relieved at finally being able to be together. For all their proclamations of guilt, they were still happy they could sleep in the same bed without fear of me catching them. All while I picked up the scattered shards of my life and tried to put it back together with chewing gum and missing pieces. Did I want to see Terry? I didn\u2019t particularly want to see either of them, but for the sake of ripping off the plaster, I thought it best to just get it over with.</p><p>Stomach burning, I answered coldly. \u201cI want to go over our marriage, but seeing as it turns out he\u2019s been a part of it, then fine.\u201d</p><p>I hung up as he started to tell me he was looking forward to us talking. His snivelling and grovelling sickened me. It was false and barely touched the tip when it came to making up for his treatment of me during our marriage. I\u2019d been belittled, bullied, and threatened. He\u2019d taken advantage of how broken I was, how fragile a person I was, that I lacked guidance from a loving family. There had been nobody to warn me that the rich, handsome, successful man who was giving me attention and lavishing me gifts, might not be all he seemed. No father to warn him that if he hurt me, there\u2019d be consequences. No mother to tell me of her own close call with a man who\u2019d dazzled her but turned out to be the wrong man. I\u2019d taken Will at face value and believed him when he said he loved me.</p><p>When he\u2019d proposed, I\u2019d never felt happiness like it. I\u2019d known it was coming, having found the ring a few days before, but I was still surprised when he got on one knee and asked me to be his wife.

And I\u2019d believed him.</p><p>He used my feelings of unworthiness to his advantage and conducted his affair, knowing it would go unnoticed and unmentioned.

He owes you somewhere to live at the very least.&rdquo;</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t entirely against the idea. He&rsquo;d kept me from working and earning my own money, so it made sense that he would at least help out. We hadn&rsquo;t spoken since I&rsquo;d left. I&rsquo;d ignored all his calls, texts, and visits to Rose&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;d even been to my workplace but, thankfully, I&rsquo;d been at a wedding. Rose had been the one who&rsquo;d called to tell him not to come to my office again or his mother would be getting a call from me. He couldn&rsquo;t understand that what I needed was space, but that had been enough for him to get the message, and the barrage eased up to just a single, daily voicemail pleading his case.</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno. I&rsquo;m not that desperate yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then stop stressing yourself out,&rdquo; my friend smiled, pushing her wine glass towards me so I&rsquo;d take a sip. &ldquo;He wants your forgiveness. I&rsquo;d be very surprised if he refused to help.&rdquo;</p><p>I shook my head and gave in, picking up her glass and tasting the ice cold white wine. It was more bitter than I liked, so I reached for the bottle and poured some into my lemonade. I tasted the mix, preferring the now sweeter, refreshing drink, and continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doubtful he&rsquo;d help, but I will try. Just&hellip; Just not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>We sat in silence for a little while, enjoying the chatter of the conversation of the people around us. I checked my phone and was considering messaging Will to sort out a time to meet when Rose spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she started nervously. I looked up at her and knew there was something coming and I wasn&rsquo;t going to like it. &ldquo;I ran into Harry last night.&rdquo;</p><p>Trying to pretend I wasn&rsquo;t bothered, I nodded for her to continue. &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; He asked how you were and said that he missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; My heart was thumping hard in my chest. I couldn&rsquo;t let myself believe he did miss me, but the fact he&rsquo;d said it to her was a comfort. &ldquo;Did you tell him about me and Will?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he said he&rsquo;d heard rumours you weren&rsquo;t together but wasn&rsquo;t sure if they were true or not.&rdquo; She was holding back something and I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure I wanted to know what it was.</p><p>&ldquo;What aren&rsquo;t you telling me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we talked for quite a while and &mdash; I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m actually saying this &mdash; I think you should contact him.&rdquo; I stared at her, mouth agape in shock. &nbsp;\"Yeah, yeah! I know! I&rsquo;ve spent the entire time calling him a shitbag, but I think he really has feelings for you, Layla.&ldquo; I let out a snort, but she continued. \"Honestly, I kept trying to walk away from him because I had work to do, but he wouldn&rsquo;t bloody let me! Even if I did manage to get away, once I was back in his reach, he&rsquo;d corner me again and ask a billion questions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The thing is Rose, he knows where I am. He knows I&rsquo;m not with Will. If he was really that interested, he&rsquo;d have called to see if the rumours were true.&rdquo; Feeling the positivity I&rsquo;d felt slipping away, I reached inside my bag to grab my purse. I needed more wine. &ldquo;Another bottle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lil&mdash;&rdquo; I could see her concern that she&rsquo;d pissed me off and her regret of even telling me about their conversation. I wasn&rsquo;t pissed off &mdash; I was worried by how easy it would be to just fall into his life again if given half the chance.</p><p>&ldquo;I just need to sort my life out before I contemplate dealing with Harry, who &mdash; if I may remind you &mdash; told me he loved me then disappeared to shag a supermodel.&rdquo; Standing up, I shrugged my shoulders and let out a long, tired sigh. &ldquo;Maybe in a month or two, but for now I just need a night off from thinking and finding somewhere to live.&rdquo;</p><p>&bull;</p><p>&ldquo;Will French speaking.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing my husband&rsquo;s voice made me pause. He sounded formal and business-like, not knowing who was on the other end. I&rsquo;d called his direct line at the office, knowing the extension number off by heart. I&rsquo;d hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t answer the call, that he was in a meeting or with a client, but to my dismay he picked up the call on the third ring. Meaning that I would finally have to hold a conversation with him, and finally arrange when we could meet to discuss the future of our marriage.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Layla.&rdquo; Voice clipped, I&rsquo;d spent the previous hour rehearsing what I would say and trying my best not to sound nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;Layla!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you called. Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>I took a deep breath and doodled my anxiety in the margins of the notepad I&rsquo;d written my script in. Archimedes spirals and cubes with thick, heavy lines distracted my hands temporarily and eased the shake as I spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been better, William,&rdquo; I replied tartly, annoyed at his cheek of pretending like he gave a shit how I was. &ldquo;Anyway, I guess it&rsquo;s about time we meet up and talk about where we go from here.&rdquo;</p><p>Will cleared his throat, and went silent. On the other end of the line, I heard pages turning as he checked his diary. He had a habit of sticking to keeping appointments and important plans in an old-fashioned book, sticking by the opinion that &lsquo;if it was good enough for my father, it&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m free Monday evening.&rdquo;</p><p>With no enquiry into whether that would be suitable for him, I attempted to start things as I meant to go on. I had spent far too long going by my husband&rsquo;s rules, planning my life around his events and functions, but that wasn&rsquo;t how I wanted to things to be anymore. We would meet on Monday, or not at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; Oh, erm, yes, okay.&rdquo; Sounding suitably thrown off, Will finally sighed. &ldquo;Okay, Monday it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great, see you the&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; he paused before asking, &ldquo;&hellip; What about Terry? Do you want to see him, too?&rdquo;</p><p>Putting my head in my hand, I once again saw their naked bodies tangled in bed, asleep and peaceful. Will and Terry. Two people who, despite trying to get me to talk to them, were probably relieved at finally being able to be together. For all their proclamations of guilt, they were still happy they could sleep in the same bed without fear of me catching them. All while I picked up the scattered shards of my life and tried to put it back together with chewing gum and missing pieces. Did I want to see Terry? I didn&rsquo;t particularly want to see either of them, but for the sake of ripping off the plaster, I thought it best to just get it over with.</p><p>Stomach burning, I answered coldly. &ldquo;I want to go over our marriage, but seeing as it turns out he&rsquo;s been a part of it, then fine.&rdquo;</p><p>I hung up as he started to tell me he was looking forward to us talking. His snivelling and grovelling sickened me. It was false and barely touched the tip when it came to making up for his treatment of me during our marriage. I&rsquo;d been belittled, bullied, and threatened. He&rsquo;d taken advantage of how broken I was, how fragile a person I was, that I lacked guidance from a loving family. There had been nobody to warn me that the rich, handsome, successful man who was giving me attention and lavishing me gifts, might not be all he seemed. No father to warn him that if he hurt me, there&rsquo;d be consequences. No mother to tell me of her own close call with a man who&rsquo;d dazzled her but turned out to be the wrong man. I&rsquo;d taken Will at face value and believed him when he said he loved me.</p><p>When he&rsquo;d proposed, I&rsquo;d never felt happiness like it. I&rsquo;d known it was coming, having found the ring a few days before, but I was still surprised when he got on one knee and asked me to be his wife. I didn&rsquo;t feel worthy of the proposal, genuinely believing that he deserved someone of his own pedigree, someone who also knew the right people and had had the right upbringing. I didn&rsquo;t fit in with his circle. I didn&rsquo;t have my own family estate, or go to school with this person or that. I didn&rsquo;t know how to ride a horse or go hunting. Will had told me that was what he liked about me: I was different and I&rsquo;d lived a real life outside of his world. And I&rsquo;d believed him.</p><p>He used my feelings of unworthiness to his advantage and conducted his affair, knowing it would go unnoticed and unmentioned. I was the perfect cover for his secret &mdash; a secret he didn&rsquo;t want to bury, but just hide so he could continue it without question. For all my loudness and false confidence, he saw that really I was meek and desperate for love. I&rsquo;d wanted to be loved, to be protected, to have the sense of security I&rsquo;d never felt before. For that, I&rsquo;d been easily manipulated into doing as I was told.</p><p>With the marvellous benefit of hindsight, I could see that what Will had liked about me was that I was naive and gullible.</p><p>My thoughts turned to Harry (as they often did ever since my conversation with Rose) and if I would&rsquo;ve had the courage to leave my marriage before I met him. I&rsquo;d been jaded by the way I&rsquo;d been treated, unsurprised and accepting that that was just the way my husband was, but had I been strong enough to leave? To get a job, even?</p><p>It riled me to give credit to him. His behaviour had left him unworthy of that credit, but as much as I hated it, he had been the beginning of a change in me. He had made me stronger, allowing me to see myself in a new, better light. Despite my weakness for him, he had given me a strength and belief that maybe I didn&rsquo;t have to just sit back and accept being someone&rsquo;s doormat. I was better than that.</p><p>(The irony hadn&rsquo;t escaped me that Harry had then proceeded to walk all over me himself.)</p><p>Regardless, Harry had made me feel good &mdash; amazing, in fact &mdash; and had I not been given the reminder that I could feel that way, it was likely I&rsquo;d have stayed put. Not acting as a cover for two people I loved who couldn&rsquo;t be together openly, but because I was too scared to leave.</p>",

David Bowie famously called Elton John \u201cthe Liberace, the token queen of rock.\u201d </p><p>In the RS interview, Elton answered: <i>Bowie\u2019s a little crazed, I think.

Filling the room I didn\u2019t want to get up and leave the warmth of our bed. I look over to my phone knocking the alarm off. \u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d He whines, pulling me in closer to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSome of us have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSome of us have long days. Not just one meeting, Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d He rolls his eyes letting go of me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you ring Jess. You haven\u2019t spoken to her since I got here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou telling me what to do now? Aren\u2019t even my girlfriend and you are already bossing me about.\u201d He sits up against the head board as I put my dress gown on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNope. You\u2019ve already got a girlfriend for that.\u201d He rolls his eyes. As I leave him to get ready.\u00a0</p><p>I finish my morning routine to find Harry in the exact spot I left him in. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for later?\u201d He calls me over to the bed. \u201cI should be finished before five. So I\u2019ll go to my hotel and get ready, then I\u2019ve got some work to catch up on. Shall I meet you at the restaurant?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, sounds good to me.\u201d He crawls to edge of the best to come and kiss me. \u201cHave a great day babe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d I kiss him one last time before leaving.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d I say before leaving his hotel room.\u00a0</p><p>I had a day of shooting whilst in New York, then I needed to follow up on emails and admin afterwards. I had tried my best efforts into looking as nice as I could for Harry tonight. Black lace lingerie, and a tight emerald green mid length dress with a pair of heels. My hair was in a loose messy bun with strands falling infant of my face.\u00a0</p><p>Walking into the restaurant I inform the waitress of the name the table was booked under. She walked me over to where they both were sat. \u201cThere she is.\u201d Jeff States climbing out of the booth to greet me straight away. He brought me into a tight hug. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really has.\u201d In the meantime Harry had climbed out of the booth too, to allow me to sit in the middle. I greet him with the same hug as Jeff to keep up appearances. I slide into the booth in between both men. \u201cSo how\u2019s the husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great.\u201d I roll my eyes at Jeff. \u201cHow\u2019s the missus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual.\u201d He replies. \u201cI was asking Harry why Jess hasn\u2019t turned up to this leg of the tour yet.\u201d He states. I look at Harry raising my eyebrows. \u201cBecause she wasn\u2019t invited,\u201d Jeff adds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask her?\u201d I ask in shock at him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Harry just hides behind his menu.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause he would rather have mistress here instead.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I shout slapping Jeff\u2019s arm. At the same time as Harry barked his name.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m right.\u201d The pair just seems to laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTechnically he\u2019s my mistress, he isn\u2019t married,\u201d I said, making light of the situation.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00a0</p><p>Flashback\u00a0</p><p>I had walked backstage to Harry\u2019s dressing room. Knocking on the door he shouts for me to come in. The moment I walked through the door Harry grabbed my arm dragging me and pushing me against the wall. His lips latched onto mine by my surprise. \u201cGod I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d He says, grabbing my legs so I would wrap them around his waist. His lips move their way down to my neck. \u201cYou were amazing babe.\u201d His leave my neck as he looks up at smiles at me. His lips then crash down on mine as the need for one another intensifies. He walks with me over to the dressing table placing me down. My hands are quick to his trousers as I unbutton quickly. He lifts my skirt up above my hips and pulling off my underwear. Dropping his trousers down a little he takes himself out of his boxers. I position my self to the edge of the dressing table so he could enter me.\u00a0</p><p>My legs were tightly wrapped around his waist as he pushed deeper into me, I was pressed against the dressing room mirror as our bodies kept knocking hair styling product over. Without noticing the door was opened and closed. \u201cH, mate.\u201d The sound of Jeff\u2019s voice stopped us in our tracks. Jeff eyes suddenly left his phone and moved to us. \u201cWhat the fuck do you two think you are doing?\u201d He shouts at us both. I look to Harry not knowing what to do. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll let you two finish.\u201d He says before leaving the dressing.\u00a0</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes before looking to me. \u201cWe need to speak to him\u201d I say looking into Harry\u2019s eyes. He nods, pulling himself out of me. I jumped off the dressing table making myself look presentable, putting my underwear back up and pulling my skirt back down. Harry did the same, putting himself back into his trousers. I take a seat on the couch as Harry left the dressing room to find Jeff. Luckily he was only outside waiting. \u201cAre you two fucking kidding me?\u201d He shouts at us as though we were two stupid teenagers. \u201cJeff. Don\u2019t mate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t? Me, don\u2019t? Harry, she is fucking married.\u201d He shouts. \u201cShe is fucking married to our friend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d Harry shouts in return.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow long as this been going on for?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNearly a year.\u201d I answer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBefore the wedding?\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck&rsquo;s sake (Y/N).\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJeff.\u201d Harry states.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd you, you have a girlfriend Harry.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cJess is probably sat paranoid that you are drinking every night. That there are hundreds of women throwing themselves at you and all along she should be paranoid her friend is screwing her boyfriend.\u201d I stand up looking away from Jeff. He was right. What we were doing to Jess and Dan was awful. \u201cDan is our mate. Jess is our mate. We all go out together for meals, for holidays and trips away and all this time you two have been hooking up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that.\u201d Harry said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo on Harry. What is it like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound cheap and disgusting like we enjoy having to lie to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d H admitted.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d He asks me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jeff\u2019s says taking a seat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d I say about to leave. I stopped to pick up my handbag which was dropped in the process of our kisses. I had arranged to stay the night at Harry hotel room. He handed me the key before I left and I kissed him quickly before I left the dressing room.\u00a0</p><p>I sat in the bed nervously waiting for Harry\u2019s return. He had never stayed back so late after a concert which caused my body to fill with anxiety. I hadn\u2019t got a message or a phone call from him. My attention is bright to Harry walking through the hotel room door. \u201cHey.\u201d He walks over to lay down on my chest. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d I ask. Stroking his hair. His head was resting on my chest as he wrapped his hands around me. \u201cFine. He\u2019s fine with it.\u201d Harry looked up at me, his chin resting in-between my boobs. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. He doesn\u2019t approve but he understands why.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs she going to-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Harry states. I kiss his head. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I nodded looking down at him. \u201cCome on let\u2019s sleep.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Back to the restaurant.\u00a0</p><p>Amongst small conversations and catching up the food and arrived, been eaten and we were currently contemplating dessert. Harry\u2019s hand had been placed on my leg the whole night. Making soft little circles and rubbing ever so gently. \u201c(Y/N) will you be at MSG tomorrow?\u201d Jeff asks. \u201cCourse I will be. I\u2019m not going to miss it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen do you go back home?\u201d He adds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe day after the last gig.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Anne and Gemma are both arriving tomorrow?\u201d He asks Harry. Harry just nods. He had been quiet the whole night. \u201cDid they tell you we are going out?\u201d I ask Harry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had a chance to speak to them much with the traveling.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes. We are going to do a bit of sightseeing and some shopping.\u201d We had decided to not get a desert and to leave as the next was an important day for everyone. Harry and I had to take separate cars back to the hotel room. We had to be brought into the back entrance of the hotel room. He had managed to arrive there a little bit before.\u00a0</p><p>I opened the room to see Harry staring down at his phone in frustration. He was already shirtless, one hand on the phone and the other holding his trousers up. \u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong? You\u2019ve been distracted all night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d He forces a smile to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cLie to me, we said we\u2019ve never lie to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He throws his phone on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m arguing with Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s annoyed she isn\u2019t over here now.\u201d He removes his trousers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d He walks over to kiss me before going into the bathroom to start getting ready for bed. \u201cI would rather have you there.\u201d He smiles at me looking into the mirror.</p><p>\u201cSo you told her she couldn\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I said people would get suspicious of her and it might lead to the relationship going public. She\u2019s getting tired of all that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame her.\u201d I walk over to the table placing my handbag down and removing my heels. His phone started flashing. \u201cH, she\u2019s ringing you.\u201d I shout. I decided to go into the bathroom and get ready for bed as he argued with his girlfriend.\u00a0</p><p>I came out in my silk dressing gown as he laid on the bed in his boxers trying to find something for us to watch on tv. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d He nods motions me to come cuddle next to him.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"526\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"pinkharold:WSuPjd9atWkLwq2TwA8iSw:Z54hYh2R00ZRV\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/377c50b02042ce888aec86bbff545cb3/tumblr_oxve6yrrf11vpshjao2_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"526\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure>",

Knocking on the door he shouts for me to come in. The moment I walked through the door Harry grabbed my arm dragging me and pushing me against the wall. His lips latched onto mine by my surprise. \u201cGod I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d He says, grabbing my legs so I would wrap them around his waist. His lips move their way down to my neck. \u201cYou were amazing babe.\u201d His leave my neck as he looks up at smiles at me. His lips then crash down on mine as the need for one another intensifies. He walks with me over to the dressing table placing me down. My hands are quick to his trousers as I unbutton quickly. He lifts my skirt up above my hips and pulling off my underwear. Dropping his trousers down a little he takes himself out of his boxers. I position my self to the edge of the dressing table so he could enter me.\u00a0</p><p>My legs were tightly wrapped around his waist as he pushed deeper into me, I was pressed against the dressing room mirror as our bodies kept knocking hair styling product over. Without noticing the door was opened and closed. \u201cH, mate.\u201d The sound of Jeff\u2019s voice stopped us in our tracks. Jeff eyes suddenly left his phone and moved to us. \u201cWhat the fuck do you two think you are doing?\u201d He shouts at us both. I look to Harry not knowing what to do. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll let you two finish.\u201d He says before leaving the dressing.\u00a0</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes before looking to me. \u201cWe need to speak to him\u201d I say looking into Harry\u2019s eyes. He nods, pulling himself out of me. I jumped off the dressing table making myself look presentable, putting my underwear back up and pulling my skirt back down. Harry did the same, putting himself back into his trousers. I take a seat on the couch as Harry left the dressing room to find Jeff. Luckily he was only outside waiting. \u201cAre you two fucking kidding me?\u201d He shouts at us as though we were two stupid teenagers. \u201cJeff. Don\u2019t mate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t? Me, don\u2019t?

That there are hundreds of women throwing themselves at you and all along she should be paranoid her friend is screwing her boyfriend.\u201d I stand up looking away from Jeff. He was right. What we were doing to Jess and Dan was awful. \u201cDan is our mate. Jess is our mate. We all go out together for meals, for holidays and trips away and all this time you two have been hooking up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that.\u201d Harry said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo on Harry. What is it like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound cheap and disgusting like we enjoy having to lie to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d H admitted.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d He asks me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jeff\u2019s says taking a seat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d I say about to leave. I stopped to pick up my handbag which was dropped in the process of our kisses. I had arranged to stay the night at Harry hotel room. He handed me the key before I left and I kissed him quickly before I left the dressing room.\u00a0</p><p>I sat in the bed nervously waiting for Harry\u2019s return. He had never stayed back so late after a concert which caused my body to fill with anxiety. I hadn\u2019t got a message or a phone call from him. My attention is bright to Harry walking through the hotel room door. \u201cHey.\u201d He walks over to lay down on my chest. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d I ask. Stroking his hair. His head was resting on my chest as he wrapped his hands around me. \u201cFine. He\u2019s fine with it.\u201d Harry looked up at me, his chin resting in-between my boobs. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. He doesn\u2019t approve but he understands why.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs she going to-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Harry states. I kiss his head. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I nodded looking down at him. \u201cCome on let\u2019s sleep.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Back to the restaurant.\u00a0</p><p>Amongst small conversations and catching up the food and arrived, been eaten and we were currently contemplating dessert. Harry\u2019s hand had been placed on my leg the whole night. Making soft little circles and rubbing ever so gently. \u201c(Y/N) will you be at MSG tomorrow?\u201d Jeff asks. \u201cCourse I will be. I\u2019m not going to miss it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen do you go back home?\u201d He adds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe day after the last gig.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Anne and Gemma are both arriving tomorrow?\u201d He asks Harry. Harry just nods. He had been quiet the whole night. \u201cDid they tell you we are going out?\u201d I ask Harry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had a chance to speak to them much with the traveling.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes. We are going to do a bit of sightseeing and some shopping.\u201d We had decided to not get a desert and to leave as the next was an important day for everyone. Harry and I had to take separate cars back to the hotel room. We had to be brought into the back entrance of the hotel room. He had managed to arrive there a little bit before.\u00a0</p><p>I opened the room to see Harry staring down at his phone in frustration. He was already shirtless, one hand on the phone and the other holding his trousers up. \u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong? You\u2019ve been distracted all night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d He forces a smile to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cLie to me, we said we\u2019ve never lie to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He throws his phone on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m arguing with Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s annoyed she isn\u2019t over here now.\u201d He removes his trousers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d He walks over to kiss me before going into the bathroom to start getting ready for bed. \u201cI would rather have you there.\u201d He smiles at me looking into the mirror.</p><p>\u201cSo you told her she couldn\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I said people would get suspicious of her and it might lead to the relationship going public. She\u2019s getting tired of all that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame her.\u201d I walk over to the table placing my handbag down and removing my heels. His phone started flashing. \u201cH, she\u2019s ringing you.\u201d I shout. I decided to go into the bathroom and get ready for bed as he argued with his girlfriend.\u00a0</p><p>I came out in my silk dressing gown as he laid on the bed in his boxers trying to find something for us to watch on tv. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d He nods motions me to come cuddle next to him.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"526\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"pinkharold:WSuPjd9atWkLwq2TwA8iSw:Z54hYh2R00ZRV\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/377c50b02042ce888aec86bbff545cb3/tumblr_oxve6yrrf11vpshjao2_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"526\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure></p>",

Filling the room I didn\u2019t want to get up and leave the warmth of our bed. I look over to my phone knocking the alarm off. \u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d He whines, pulling me in closer to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSome of us have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSome of us have long days.

As I leave him to get ready.\u00a0</p><p>I finish my morning routine to find Harry in the exact spot I left him in. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for later?\u201d He calls me over to the bed. \u201cI should be finished before five. So I\u2019ll go to my hotel and get ready, then I\u2019ve got some work to catch up on. Shall I meet you at the restaurant?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, sounds good to me.\u201d He crawls to edge of the best to come and kiss me. \u201cHave a great day babe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d I kiss him one last time before leaving.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d I say before leaving his hotel room.\u00a0</p><p>I had a day of shooting whilst in New York, then I needed to follow up on emails and admin afterwards. I had tried my best efforts into looking as nice as I could for Harry tonight. Black lace lingerie, and a tight emerald green mid length dress with a pair of heels. My hair was in a loose messy bun with strands falling infant of my face.\u00a0</p><p>Walking into the restaurant I inform the waitress of the name the table was booked under. She walked me over to where they both were sat. \u201cThere she is.\u201d Jeff States climbing out of the booth to greet me straight away. He brought me into a tight hug. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really has.\u201d In the meantime Harry had climbed out of the booth too, to allow me to sit in the middle.

What is it like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound cheap and disgusting like we enjoy having to lie to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d H admitted.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d He asks me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jeff\u2019s says taking a seat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d I say about to leave. I stopped to pick up my handbag which was dropped in the process of our kisses. I had arranged to stay the night at Harry hotel room. He handed me the key before I left and I kissed him quickly before I left the dressing room.\u00a0</p><p>I sat in the bed nervously waiting for Harry\u2019s return. He had never stayed back so late after a concert which caused my body to fill with anxiety. I hadn\u2019t got a message or a phone call from him. My attention is bright to Harry walking through the hotel room door. \u201cHey.\u201d He walks over to lay down on my chest. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d I ask. Stroking his hair. His head was resting on my chest as he wrapped his hands around me. \u201cFine. He\u2019s fine with it.\u201d Harry looked up at me, his chin resting in-between my boobs. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. He doesn\u2019t approve but he understands why.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs she going to-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Harry states. I kiss his head. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I nodded looking down at him. \u201cCome on let\u2019s sleep.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Back to the restaurant.\u00a0</p><p>Amongst small conversations and catching up the food and arrived, been eaten and we were currently contemplating dessert. Harry\u2019s hand had been placed on my leg the whole night. Making soft little circles and rubbing ever so gently. \u201c(Y/N) will you be at MSG tomorrow?\u201d Jeff asks. \u201cCourse I will be. I\u2019m not going to miss it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen do you go back home?\u201d He adds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe day after the last gig.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Anne and Gemma are both arriving tomorrow?\u201d He asks Harry. Harry just nods. He had been quiet the whole night. \u201cDid they tell you we are going out?\u201d I ask Harry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had a chance to speak to them much with the traveling.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes. We are going to do a bit of sightseeing and some shopping.\u201d We had decided to not get a desert and to leave as the next was an important day for everyone. Harry and I had to take separate cars back to the hotel room. We had to be brought into the back entrance of the hotel room. He had managed to arrive there a little bit before.\u00a0</p><p>I opened the room to see Harry staring down at his phone in frustration. He was already shirtless, one hand on the phone and the other holding his trousers up. \u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong? You\u2019ve been distracted all night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d He forces a smile to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cLie to me, we said we\u2019ve never lie to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He throws his phone on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m arguing with Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s annoyed she isn\u2019t over here now.\u201d He removes his trousers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d He walks over to kiss me before going into the bathroom to start getting ready for bed. \u201cI would rather have you there.\u201d He smiles at me looking into the mirror.</p><p>\u201cSo you told her she couldn\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I said people would get suspicious of her and it might lead to the relationship going public. She\u2019s getting tired of all that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame her.\u201d I walk over to the table placing my handbag down and removing my heels. His phone started flashing. \u201cH, she\u2019s ringing you.\u201d I shout. I decided to go into the bathroom and get ready for bed as he argued with his girlfriend.\u00a0</p><p>I came out in my silk dressing gown as he laid on the bed in his boxers trying to find something for us to watch on tv. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d He nods motions me to come cuddle next to him.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"526\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"pinkharold:WSuPjd9atWkLwq2TwA8iSw:Z54hYh2R00ZRV\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/377c50b02042ce888aec86bbff545cb3/tumblr_oxve6yrrf11vpshjao2_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"526\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure></p>",

Filling the room I didn&rsquo;t want to get up and leave the warmth of our bed. I look over to my phone knocking the alarm off. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo; He whines, pulling me in closer to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Some of us have to go to work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Some of us have long days. Not just one meeting, Styles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo; He rolls his eyes letting go of me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you ring Jess. You haven&rsquo;t spoken to her since I got here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You telling me what to do now? Aren&rsquo;t even my girlfriend and you are already bossing me about.&rdquo; He sits up against the head board as I put my dress gown on.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. You&rsquo;ve already got a girlfriend for that.&rdquo; He rolls his eyes. As I leave him to get ready.&nbsp;</p><p>I finish my morning routine to find Harry in the exact spot I left him in. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan for later?&rdquo; He calls me over to the bed. &ldquo;I should be finished before five. So I&rsquo;ll go to my hotel and get ready, then I&rsquo;ve got some work to catch up on. Shall I meet you at the restaurant?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sounds good to me.&rdquo; He crawls to edge of the best to come and kiss me. &ldquo;Have a great day babe.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You too.&rdquo; I kiss him one last time before leaving.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; I say before leaving his hotel room.&nbsp;</p><p>I had a day of shooting whilst in New York, then I needed to follow up on emails and admin afterwards. I had tried my best efforts into looking as nice as I could for Harry tonight. Black lace lingerie, and a tight emerald green mid length dress with a pair of heels. My hair was in a loose messy bun with strands falling infant of my face.&nbsp;</p><p>Walking into the restaurant I inform the waitress of the name the table was booked under. She walked me over to where they both were sat. &ldquo;There she is.&rdquo; Jeff States climbing out of the booth to greet me straight away. He brought me into a tight hug. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been too long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It really has.&rdquo; In the meantime Harry had climbed out of the booth too, to allow me to sit in the middle. I greet him with the same hug as Jeff to keep up appearances. I slide into the booth in between both men. &ldquo;So how&rsquo;s the husband?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; I roll my eyes at Jeff. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the missus?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The usual.&rdquo; He replies. &ldquo;I was asking Harry why Jess hasn&rsquo;t turned up to this leg of the tour yet.&rdquo; He states. I look at Harry raising my eyebrows. &ldquo;Because she wasn&rsquo;t invited,&rdquo; Jeff adds.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask her?&rdquo; I ask in shock at him. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Harry just hides behind his menu.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he would rather have mistress here instead.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; I shout slapping Jeff&rsquo;s arm. At the same time as Harry barked his name.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo; The pair just seems to laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Technically he&rsquo;s my mistress, he isn&rsquo;t married,&rdquo; I said, making light of the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</p><p>Flashback&nbsp;</p><p>I had walked backstage to Harry&rsquo;s dressing room. Knocking on the door he shouts for me to come in. The moment I walked through the door Harry grabbed my arm dragging me and pushing me against the wall. His lips latched onto mine by my surprise. &ldquo;God I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about you.&rdquo; He says, grabbing my legs so I would wrap them around his waist. His lips move their way down to my neck. &ldquo;You were amazing babe.&rdquo; His leave my neck as he looks up at smiles at me. His lips then crash down on mine as the need for one another intensifies. He walks with me over to the dressing table placing me down. My hands are quick to his trousers as I unbutton quickly. He lifts my skirt up above my hips and pulling off my underwear. Dropping his trousers down a little he takes himself out of his boxers. I position my self to the edge of the dressing table so he could enter me.&nbsp;</p><p>My legs were tightly wrapped around his waist as he pushed deeper into me, I was pressed against the dressing room mirror as our bodies kept knocking hair styling product over. Without noticing the door was opened and closed. &ldquo;H, mate.&rdquo; The sound of Jeff&rsquo;s voice stopped us in our tracks. Jeff eyes suddenly left his phone and moved to us. &ldquo;What the fuck do you two think you are doing?&rdquo; He shouts at us both. I look to Harry not knowing what to do. &ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll let you two finish.&rdquo; He says before leaving the dressing.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes before looking to me. &ldquo;We need to speak to him&rdquo; I say looking into Harry&rsquo;s eyes. He nods, pulling himself out of me. I jumped off the dressing table making myself look presentable, putting my underwear back up and pulling my skirt back down. Harry did the same, putting himself back into his trousers. I take a seat on the couch as Harry left the dressing room to find Jeff. Luckily he was only outside waiting. &ldquo;Are you two fucking kidding me?&rdquo; He shouts at us as though we were two stupid teenagers. &ldquo;Jeff. Don&rsquo;t mate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t? Me, don&rsquo;t? Harry, she is fucking married.&rdquo; He shouts. &ldquo;She is fucking married to our friend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I know that?&rdquo; Harry shouts in return.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How long as this been going on for?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nearly a year.&rdquo; I answer.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Before the wedding?&rdquo; I nod.</p><p>&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake (Y/N).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Jeff.&rdquo; Harry states.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And you, you have a girlfriend Harry.&rdquo; He shakes his head. &ldquo;Jess is probably sat paranoid that you are drinking every night. That there are hundreds of women throwing themselves at you and all along she should be paranoid her friend is screwing her boyfriend.&rdquo; I stand up looking away from Jeff. He was right. What we were doing to Jess and Dan was awful. &ldquo;Dan is our mate. Jess is our mate. We all go out together for meals, for holidays and trips away and all this time you two have been hooking up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo; Harry said.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go on Harry. What is it like?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You make it sound cheap and disgusting like we enjoy having to lie to them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why do it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love her.&rdquo; H admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you love him?&rdquo; He asks me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Jeff&rsquo;s says taking a seat.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I should go.&rdquo; I say about to leave.
