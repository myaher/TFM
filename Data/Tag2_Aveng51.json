I could also see people thinking,\u00a0\u201cThe Avengers attract intergalactic attention. None of this would have happened without them.\u201d On the other hand, after the Snap and its reversal, people have much bigger problems to worry about. I could see people thinking of the Avengers\u2019 powers as a beacon of hope and strength. Average people could give them credit for bringing back lost loved ones.\u00a0</p><p>I was running with the latter because it avoids a number of problems, but I think I actually have canonical support for it. In the new Far From Home trailer, there are several shots of shrines and memorials to Tony Stark. Now, those could be misdirection or the apparent good feeling could be aimed only at Tony, but I think it\u2019s quite plausible that people have forgotten their past antipathy toward the Avengers and are grateful to them. So I\u2019m just going to assume that the average person has a very favorable opinion of all the Avengers in the first few years after the events of Endgame. I\u2019m also throwing in that this is the excuse to get rid of the Sokovia Accords, which the world\u2019s governments may not want to devote resources to enforcing anyway.\u00a0</p><p>The next piece of support is far more tenuous, but it could be the case. I read an interview where Kevin Feige said the MCU won\u2019t be introducing the X-Men for about five years. I don\u2019t know how long that will end up being for in-universe time, but it would give a lot of time for public opinion to shift. I imagine that for 2-3 years post-Endgame (or a few movies), public opinion will continue to be highly favorable to the Avengers and enhanced people in general. Then, either one big event or several smaller events will start to shift it back to negative over the next 2-3 years (or few movies). This would set up a situation where the revised Sokovia Accords are ratified just in time for the X-Men to come in (whether from an alternate universe or the Snap did something that is causing gradual mutations or whatever other method they might use). Since anti-mutant sentiment seems to be an important part of most of their stories.\u00a0</p>",
