It\u2019s not unreasonable, and the show hasn\u2019t really done anything for their relationship like the books have. They need the audience to see this relationship grow, to evolve and go through trials and tests to demonstrate the strength of their bond and how no matter what, they\u2019ll support each other. It\u2019s storytelling, after all. </p><p>It\u2019s easy to forget that most of the GA haven\u2019t actually read the books and don\u2019t really know their history as well.

Only shards remained of its windows of leaded glass, and the aged septon who greeted them said the looters had even made off with the Mother&rsquo;s costly robes, the Crone&rsquo;s gilded lantern, and the silver crown the Father had worn. &ldquo;They hacked the Maiden&rsquo;s breasts off too, though those were only wood,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;And the eyes, the eyes were jet and lapis and mother-of-pearl, they pried them out with their knives. May the Mother have mercy on them all.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Whose work was this?&rdquo; said Lem Lemoncloak. &ldquo;Mummers?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;Northmen, they were. Savages who worship trees. They wanted the Kingslayer, they said.&rdquo;<br/>\nArya heard him, and chewed her lip. She could feel Gendry looking at her. It made her angry and ashamed.",

        "body": "<h1>My Boo Arya </h1><p>I don&rsquo;t get this characterization of Arya as a senseless killer. She was/is a tomboy(I can identify since am one myself) that was forced into a life on the run through no action of her own and had to do what she had to do to survive and through all of that she has killed people who wronged her,her friends and her family. Her first kill was an accident and in her eyes you could see that she was scared and surprised about it. Senseless killers don&rsquo;t spare actress who they are instructed to kill,a girl who was related to the man who killed her brother and mother,a man who held her hostage and an old man she is tasked to kill. Senseless killers kill whomever they want for whatever reason and that is not ARYA STARK OF WINTERFELL. She kills people who have wronged her in some way and I don&rsquo;t fault her for that. In this period of time,an eye for an eye was the best form of justice. She is loyal to her friends and family and that loyalty is what drives her to seek justice for them. I agree with her methods of avenging her loved ones. Even after all she have been through she STILL have her humanity intact as shown by her when she stops the Hound on multiple occasions from taking advantage of the small folk. As much as I love the warrior aspect of her character,their is more to her than that. She is loyal to those she loves(loves this about her)she is not an elitist,she is loving,she is ambitious,she is friendly and she actually care about people.</p><p>Now on to this mess of her not being able to have a romantic relationship or being capable of being loved because she is a senseless killer or a tomboy. Arya avenging her family and friends by killing the people who wronged them is not something that is going to be her whole life because people actually grow and change.

She was/is a tomboy(I can identify since am one myself) that was forced into a life on the run through no action of her own and had to do what she had to do to survive and through all of that she has killed people who wronged her,her friends and her family. Her first kill was an accident and in her eyes you could see that she was scared and surprised about it. Senseless killers don\u2019t spare actress who they are instructed to kill,a girl who was related to the man who killed her brother and mother,a man who held her hostage and an old man she is tasked to kill. Senseless killers kill whomever they want for whatever reason and that is not ARYA STARK OF WINTERFELL. She kills people who have wronged her in some way and I don\u2019t fault her for that. In this period of time,an eye for an eye was the best form of justice. She is loyal to her friends and family and that loyalty is what drives her to seek justice for them. I agree with her methods of avenging her loved ones. Even after all she have been through she STILL have her humanity intact as shown by her when she stops the Hound on multiple occasions from taking advantage of the small folk.
