The moment that really stood out was when he used the Infinity Stones to destroy Thanos and his army before saying \u201cI am Iron Man\u201d, but dies as a result of the immense energy of the stones. This is one of the most impactful of the entire movie, thus giving Robert Downey Jr. an excellent final performance as the character who started the MCU.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"213\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dezuechelon:2egsygEpGh3cp92nIyrj1w:ZZhENx2h-BKfM\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c14fc901c011be15800de0477020da1a/tumblr_pr1kho3fvd1qlrau5o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"213\"/></figure><p>Steve Rogers has his moments in the movie with him seeing Peggy Carter during his trip to the 1970s, one of those quiet moments that makes you feel Steve\u2019s longing for her. He also tricked the Hydra agents in 2012 into giving him Loki\u2019s scepter by making them believe he was Hydra (an allusion to the comics). During the final battle with Thanos, Steve finally became worthy of wielding Mjolnir and went to town on him like nothing (also another allusion). After Tony\u2019s funeral, Steve travelled through the Quantum Tunnel to return the Infinity Stones and Mjolnir to their intended points in time. But it was revealed that Steve remained in the 1940s with Peggy after finishing his mission and is now Old Man Steve. He then gives his shield to Sam Wilson as the next Captain America. The last scene is Steve and Peggy finally sharing that dance she talked about at the end of Captain America: the First Avenger.</p><h2>The Conclusion</h2><p>The movie has numerous great moments that greatly defines the franchise itself and sets the bar higher. Even though the flaws can be distracting like how Old Man Steve seemingly creates a sort of paradox in the main timeline as well as having two versions of him present in one timeline; they don\u2019t distract from how amazing this movie is and what these characters represent to the dedicated audience of this decade old franchise.\u00a0</p><h2><b><i>Go and watch this movie.</i></b></h2>",

You were suppose to meet Carol here at 3, it was a quarter past now and you grew more anxious with each passing minute.</p><p>You met her a few nights ago at a bar, where she sang karaoke like a mad woman and rescued so from a shady dude who was trying to hit on you. Both of you immediately hit it of and spend the rest of the night together laughing and talking. At the end of it she took your phone, saved her number ( as Carol \ud83d\ude09 ) and asked if you wanted to meet up for a coffee. <br/></p><p>You were like a solid 80% sure this was supposed to be a date but with someone as cool and beautiful as Carol you weren&rsquo;t quite sure, since you know, you were just you. <br/></p><p>You started bouncing your leg, the rather harsh wind biting at your skin. But you didn&rsquo;t wanna go inside just yet, not without Carol, what if she stood you up, you would look like a fool, not that you would think Carol would let you down like that but still&hellip;. she was 15 minutes late&hellip; And with your wildly spiraling thoughts you didn&rsquo;t even register the person suddenly standing in front of you. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey gorgeous, waiting for someone?&rdquo;, Carol asked with her signature smirk, using the same pick-up line the creep from a few nights ago tried using on you. <br/>&ldquo;Ohh uh ewww&rdquo; you let out slightly startled and reminded of the weirdo from the bar. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Ouch! Not happy to see me?&rdquo; Carol teased. &ldquo;Well I am, I was starting to think I would never see you again,&rdquo; you said as Carol lead you inside the Caf\u00e9. She chuckled but stopped to grab your hand softly &ldquo; I am so sorry about that, there was an inconvenience at work but I came here as fast as I could&rdquo; you took a good look at her. <br/></p><p>She was wearing a brown leather jacket (ya know the one ;D), a white shirt and blue jeans, she looked so cute with her slightly tousled hair. It did look like she ran all the way to the Caf\u00e9. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;But I am gonna make it up to you. Pick whatever you want, my treat, drinks and cake, if you like.&rdquo; She smiled brightly letting go of your hand to gently nudge you in the direction if the register, her hand now on your lower back. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, \u00a0\u00a0 you are still not quite forgiven but it&rsquo;s a good start&rdquo; you teased, both of you falling into light banter, just like the night at the bar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a Caf\u00e9 Latte and a piece of carrot cake, if that&rsquo;s ok&rdquo; you continued. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Anything for a pretty girl like you&rdquo; Carol bumped in you with her shoulder. A blush was making its way up your neck, &ldquo; how about I order and you look for a place to sit?&rdquo; Carol smiled at you.</p><p>You nodded and turned around to find a compfy spot, you looked around the caf\u00e9, it was really cute. It had small bookshelves and soft relaxing music was playing in the background. <br/>Your heart sped up as you remembered that you told Carol that you loved small coffee shops like this and it seemed like she remembered. <br/></p><p>As you placed down your bag at a table for two near the window, your eyes trailed back to Carol, who was now waiting for your order to finish. <br/>With all that witty banter you were now pretty sure this was a date. And you weren&rsquo;t quite sure whether to be nervous or exited. However Carol seemed to make it so easy to talk to her. <br/></p><p>Speaking of which, she placed your coffee and cake on the table. &ldquo;Here you go&rdquo; she said. Thanking her, you took a big sip of the coffee.<br/>&ldquo;Sooo, what have you been up to the last couple of days?&rdquo; the blonde questioned. You covered most of the usual Smalltalk like work, family and all that jass, the night at the bar. So with that question the easy going conversation started.</p><p>Carol would stop to ask more, smirk and look you deep in the eyes whenever she had the chance. Your heart would beat like a drum every time she would give you a teasing nickname or laugh at your terrible (but honestly quite good) jokes. <br/></p><p>By the end of the coffee and cake you two were nearly buzzing in your seats, exited at how good things were going. <br/></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I had a wonderful time&rdquo; you said as you stepped out of the caf\u00e9. &ldquo; So did I, and I would love to repeat that again sometime&hellip;soon&rdquo; Carol said turning to you. &ldquo;Well you have my number, all you gotta do is text&rdquo; you shyly smiled at her. <br/></p><p>Of course Carol smirked but you could also make out a faint blush on her cheeks. &ldquo;Oh I sure will, gorgeous!&rdquo; said the chocolate eyed woman as she gave you a quick peck on the cheek. You looked down with a chuckle, shaking your head. Trying to hide the massive blush appearing in your face. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Stop saying that you remind me of that creepy man,&rdquo; you mumbled.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;But why would I stop? It&rsquo;s true and I kinda have to thank him for being so dumb, he gave me the perfect reason to talk to you.&rdquo; Carol said, tilting her head slightly.</p><p> <br/>&ldquo;Oh so you had me on your mind before you talked to me? I thought this was more of an accident,&rdquo; you teased her. <br/>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; now that is not what I wanted you to take away from that statement, I think my phone is ringing\u201d Carol pretended to look for her phone \u201cit&rsquo;s work probably, I have to leave now.&rdquo; She hastily said as she gave you another kiss on the cheek and turning around to walk off fast.</p><p> &ldquo;See you soon, pretty girl!&rdquo; she yelled tuning her head over her shoulder, before disappearing behind a corner. <br/></p><p>You stood still, smiling to yourself, happy that you could maker her nervous like she made you feel all the time. Your phone buzzed a few minutes later;</p><p>Seriously though, I had a great time and I can&rsquo;t wait to see you again! - Carol \ud83d\ude09</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;<br/></p><p>It\u2019s ehhh but maybe you like it <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTskvlpJ3JfUBwC-1vcrgg\">@warlikebisexual</a><br/></p>",

You were suppose to meet Carol here at 3, it was a quarter past now and you grew more anxious with each passing minute.</p><p>You met her a few nights ago at a bar, where she sang karaoke like a mad woman and rescued so from a shady dude who was trying to hit on you. Both of you immediately hit it of and spend the rest of the night together laughing and talking. At the end of it she took your phone, saved her number ( as Carol \ud83d\ude09 ) and asked if you wanted to meet up for a coffee. <br></p><p>You were like a solid 80% sure this was supposed to be a date but with someone as cool and beautiful as Carol you weren\u2019t quite sure, since you know, you were just you. <br></p><p>You started bouncing your leg, the rather harsh wind biting at your skin. But you didn\u2019t wanna go inside just yet, not without Carol, what if she stood you up, you would look like a fool, not that you would think Carol would let you down like that but still\u2026. she was 15 minutes late\u2026 And with your wildly spiraling thoughts you didn\u2019t even register the person suddenly standing in front of you. <br></p><p>\u201cHey gorgeous, waiting for someone?\u201d, Carol asked with her signature smirk, using the same pick-up line the creep from a few nights ago tried using on you. <br>\u201cOhh uh ewww\u201d you let out slightly startled and reminded of the weirdo from the bar. <br></p><p>\u201cOuch! Not happy to see me?\u201d Carol teased. \u201cWell I am, I was starting to think I would never see you again,\u201d you said as Carol lead you inside the Caf\u00e9. She chuckled but stopped to grab your hand softly \u201c I am so sorry about that, there was an inconvenience at work but I came here as fast as I could\u201d you took a good look at her. <br></p><p>She was wearing a brown leather jacket (ya know the one ;D), a white shirt and blue jeans, she looked so cute with her slightly tousled hair. It did look like she ran all the way to the Caf\u00e9. <br></p><p>\u201cBut I am gonna make it up to you. Pick whatever you want, my treat, drinks and cake, if you like.\u201d She smiled brightly letting go of your hand to gently nudge you in the direction if the register, her hand now on your lower back. <br></p><p>\u201cHmm, \u00a0\u00a0 you are still not quite forgiven but it\u2019s a good start\u201d you teased, both of you falling into light banter, just like the night at the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll take a Caf\u00e9 Latte and a piece of carrot cake, if that\u2019s ok\u201d you continued. <br></p><p>\u201cAnything for a pretty girl like you\u201d Carol bumped in you with her shoulder. A blush was making its way up your neck, \u201c how about I order and you look for a place to sit?\u201d Carol smiled at you.</p><p>You nodded and turned around to find a compfy spot, you looked around the caf\u00e9, it was really cute. It had small bookshelves and soft relaxing music was playing in the background. <br>Your heart sped up as you remembered that you told Carol that you loved small coffee shops like this and it seemed like she remembered. <br></p><p>As you placed down your bag at a table for two near the window, your eyes trailed back to Carol, who was now waiting for your order to finish. <br>With all that witty banter you were now pretty sure this was a date. And you weren\u2019t quite sure whether to be nervous or exited. However Carol seemed to make it so easy to talk to her. <br></p><p>Speaking of which, she placed your coffee and cake on the table. \u201cHere you go\u201d she said. Thanking her, you took a big sip of the coffee.<br>\u201cSooo, what have you been up to the last couple of days?\u201d the blonde questioned. You covered most of the usual Smalltalk like work, family and all that jass, the night at the bar. So with that question the easy going conversation started.</p><p>Carol would stop to ask more, smirk and look you deep in the eyes whenever she had the chance. Your heart would beat like a drum every time she would give you a teasing nickname or laugh at your terrible (but honestly quite good) jokes. <br></p><p>By the end of the coffee and cake you two were nearly buzzing in your seats, exited at how good things were going. <br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br></p><p>\u201cI had a wonderful time\u201d you said as you stepped out of the caf\u00e9. \u201c So did I, and I would love to repeat that again sometime\u2026soon\u201d Carol said turning to you. \u201cWell you have my number, all you gotta do is text\u201d you shyly smiled at her. <br></p><p>Of course Carol smirked but you could also make out a faint blush on her cheeks. \u201cOh I sure will, gorgeous!\u201d said the chocolate eyed woman as she gave you a quick peck on the cheek. You looked down with a chuckle, shaking your head. Trying to hide the massive blush appearing in your face. <br></p><p>\u201cStop saying that you remind me of that creepy man,\u201d you mumbled.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut why would I stop?
