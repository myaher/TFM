I know she didn\u2019t really care- she just wanted something to run home and tell her mother so she\u2019d get praised for being nothing at all like me, even though she had a pregnancy scare last February.<br/></p><p>\tI nodded with a hum of affirmation, stirring the straw around my coke. I really didn\u2019t care to see the intrigue in her eyes, trying to live vicariously through me as if it were some dream but still so frustratingly smug she wasn\u2019t in my shoes.</p><p>\t\u201cGee, it must be great riding with him,\u201d Nancy, Barbara\u2019s friend, said wistfully. It was an awfully bold dream coming from a girl without a skirt above her knees in her closet. She was like my mother, who thought even poodle skirts were offensive. The thought of Nancy, with her collared button down and cardigan, on the back of a motorcycle was almost comical. Barbara leaned in across the diner\u2019s linoleum table. \u201cIs he picking you up after school?\u201d she asked like it was a secret.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you writing a book?\u201d I snapped, although I knew Barbara didn\u2019t mean to hit a touchy subject. I retracted further into my side of the booth, biting my lip and trying to keep the tears from welling in my eyes again. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d start crying again and that was not something I wanted to give these two the satisfaction of seeing. Instead, I gripped my glass tight and sucked my drink down to avoid speaking.</p><p>\tBarbara leaned back to the white leather cushions of the booth. I realized I\u2019d made it awkward as their eyes darted back and forth to each other. \u201cWhere\u2019d you meet him, by the way?\u201d Nancy asked, just trying to be nice now.</p><p>\tI smiled involuntarily, that story would always lift my spirits. I toyed with the ring I\u2019d started wearing around my ring finger outside of the company of my parents as I told them about how I\u2019d been at the candy store, picking up something sweet for my younger sister on my way home from school.</p><p>\tThe chime of the bell caught my attention as someone walked into the store that was otherwise devoid of customers. To my surprise, it was Chris Evans. He was a year or so older in the grade above me, though everyone knew he wouldn\u2019t be graduating anytime soon. The gossip of the day was how he\u2019d been sent home for wearing blue jeans.</p><p>\tHe was still wearing them, coupled with a white t-shirt he was supposed to wear under his button down. Instead, he wore a black leather jacket over it, with his collar popped of course. His dark hair was slicked back with grease, save for a few strands that hung over his forehead. I recalled how many times my father, who was the local chief of police, told me this boy was trouble. He came from the wrong side of town, where I wasn\u2019t meant to be.</p><p>\tI knew my parents would be more than disappointed if I brought home anything less than a respectable young man from a well-off family, the kind who had a letter jacket and a college dream. After all, he was known to be the leader of this pack of rascals- the kinds of kids who chewed gum in class and stayed out past curfew. But there was just something about the way Chris smiled at me as he sauntered over to where I stood by the lollipops, with one hand tucked inside his pocket and the other one taking the rainbow-spiraled sucker I\u2019d been eyeing off the shelf.</p><p>\tHe must\u2019ve caught me staring. I felt my face grow hot with an unfamiliar flush of embarrassment, but Chris didn\u2019t seem to mind. He winked at me with one of those eyes that were too blue to be true. I realized later that was when I fell for him, hard and fast like the crazy kind of people who jumped out of planes. But then, I thought I was just intrigued. I watched him walk out the door and, as he turned around and smiled at me with this grin that gave me butterflies, I had a thought. He didn\u2019t seem like he was as bad as my father always said, I figured he may just be misunderstood.</p><p>\tWhen I left the store, I saw him leaning against a sleek black motorcycle. \u201cHey, doll,\u201d he said, sliding a comb through his hair. He reached into his pocket, taking out the brightly colored candy he\u2019d bought to me like an invitation. \u201cWanna ride home?\u201d Chris asked. My eyes almost popped out of my head. I was raised to think hot-rods were the devil, imagine if I came home on the back of this thing. It was almost laughable.</p><p>Then it occurred to me how many times I regretted not doing something I wanted because someone else told me not to for no good reason, so I took the lollipop from him.</p><p>\tI followed Chris\u2019s lead, climbing onto the back of his bike. He didn\u2019t have an extra helmet, but Chris didn\u2019t think twice about giving his to me. After how my father yelled about him and all the trouble he caused over his mashed potatoes at dinner, I was surprised. If Chris could prove that preconception wrong, who was he really?</p><p>\tFor the next few months, my life was almost like a montage. Chris was an absolute sweetheart. He\u2019d take me to the movies every Friday night, even though my parents thought I was studying at my friend\u2019s house. I remember once I gushed about how much I loved Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music, which elicited this smile from Chris I\u2019d grown used to. It was soft like he was appreciating my innocence. And sometimes even condescending, though I know he never meant it like that. He just wasn\u2019t used to the sweeter side of life, he didn\u2019t have my rose-colored glasses.</p><p>\tHe brought me to these back-alley places where guys would get together and talk about their rides. The girls there shocked me, with their high hair and skin-tight clothing. They wore pants and smoked and were everything my parents had nightmares about, but there was something so fascinating about them. Chris thought it was hilarious how, in this environment, I stuck out like a sore thumb in my long plaid dress considering it was usually him who was marginalized. I started to hide a pair of pants in my bag to change into when I went out with Chris and I grew to like the way cigarettes smelled because it reminded me of him. Then I started to smoke once in awhile, sometimes when we weren\u2019t even together because it made me feel like he was.</p><p>\tChris changed, too. Once, he met me at our usual spot in a button down, suspenders, and a tie that was too big for even his broad chest. He still looked incredible, even if it was sort of strange on him. I admired him in the glow of the streetlamps, feeling underdressed for once in our relationship. \u201cThought you and I could maybe go to the pier?\u201d Chris asked, looking at me through his eyelashes as if he was nervous I would say no. Instead, I ran and jumped into his arms, spinning so hard we almost tumbled into the hot-rod he\u2019d been driving lately. When he set me back down, I kissed Chris hard as a thank you. I don\u2019t think I could ever get used to the flips my stomach did every time his lips were on mine.</p><p>\tOn weekends, my friends and other kids from our school would gather at the pier down on the beach. They had a live band who played Buddy Holly\u2019s greatest hits, among others, and everyone would go down by the beach and cut a rug until they couldn\u2019t anymore. All of my friends went and it sounded like a ball, but I spent all of my free time lately with Chris. I knew he wanted to spend as little time around people from school as possible so when I mentioned it to him I didn\u2019t think much would come of it. Yet here he was, dressed to the nines with a flower in his hand.</p><p>\tIt was a blast. I tried to teach Chris how to do the jitterbug, even though he was awfully clumsy when it came to something like that. When I started laughing at him too much, he shut me up with a promise that he\u2019d show me what he was good at later, whispered in my ear so delicately even just his breath gave me goosebumps. He\u2019d led me to his cherry-colored car, sparking some kind of fire in my belly with that twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>\tWe stopped at the gas station so I could call my mom on the pay phone and tell her I\u2019d be spending the night at my friend Betty\u2019s place. The whole time, I was thinking about how I\u2019d never grow used to this excitement Chris made me feel. It was such an unfamiliar feeling, being daring enough to lie to my parents. But I was happier with Chris than I think they\u2019d ever understand.</p><p>\tHe goosed it until we were in the middle of nowhere, one hand on the wheel and the other on my thigh. Now <i>that</i> was something. We laid under the stars on grass that grew dewy as morning approached, smoking a little and talking a lot. When I got cold, Chris got his leather jacket from the car and wrapped me up in it, giving me that warm feeling you get from whiskey with his kisses. We never went all the way, but that night we got close. As I was telling Barbara and Nancy, I realized how deeply I regretted it and didn\u2019t at the same time.</p><p>\tChris stopped down the street so my parents wouldn\u2019t see to drop me off back at my house right before dawn. He opened the door for me, closing it before he leaned against it looking at me like I never thought anyone would. Chris seemed kinda funny with his greased hair and a smile softer than some might think he was capable of. I thought it was a great look on him. \u201cHey, doll\u2026\u201d Chris trailed off, looking between me and the ring he fumbled within his fingers. It was a simple, silver band he always wore- I wish I could tell you why.</p><p>\t\u201cI want you to have this,\u201d he said. There\u2019s no way to really describe the feeling of the air being knocked out of my lungs at the same time my heart jumped to my throat. It was just the kind of stuff that made people think they were invincible. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, but Chris kept talking for me.</p><p>\u201cI know we haven\u2019t known each other too long and that you don\u2019t think your parents would like me. Hell, sometimes it feels like the whole world is against a pretty kitten like you hanging around some no good nosebleed like me.\u201d Chris looked down at the rock he was kicking with his ratty Converse. I reached for his hand, ready to reassure him it wasn\u2019t true when his eyes snapped back to mine.</p><p>\t\u201cBut I love you a hell of a lot and I hope that\u2019s enough,\u201d Chris said, sincerity dripping off every word. \u201cSo I want you to have this,\u201d he repeated, lifting my hand he held in his and slipping the ring onto my finger. I held my hand close to my heart, staring down at the new addition. I pulled him into a tight hug, hoping he wouldn\u2019t mind the tear stains I made on his white shirt as I professed my love for him, too. Chris pulled away when cold drops of rain began to fall and told me I should get inside before I caught a cold. He kissed me one last time before climbing into his hot-rod. I watched him speed off into the sunrise and made a promise to myself that I wouldn\u2019t keep him a secret any longer.</p><p>\tLike I said, that kind of love can make you feel like nothing could touch you. When I walked in, my father was already sat at the head of the dining room table. He sipped his black coffee as he scanned the newspaper in his police uniform, probably just about to head off to work.</p><p>\t\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said, still unable to stop the smile from spreading across my cheeks. He humphed without looking up from his paper and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be home so early\u2026 and so chipper.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI have every right to be,\u201d I said, somehow without faltering. The nerves started to bubble in my stomach as I chewed my bottom lip. I knew I had to just get it over with, telling myself it would be like ripping off a bandaid. I faced the fridge since I couldn\u2019t bear to see his face. \u201cChris gave me his ring.\u201d<br/><br/>\tI heard his mug hit the table harder than before. I imagined the newspaper was covered in sloshed shrapnel. \u201cChristopher Evans?\u201d my father hissed, probably hoping I\u2019d laugh and tell him that was crazy, reassuring him it was some other Chris. I reached for the milk all the way in the back as I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\tWhen I turned around, my dad was already standing right behind me. He was bright red and seething, his fists clasped so tightly at his sides that his knuckles turned white. \u201cIf I ever even think that boy is around you again, I swear to God I will beat the shit out of him and lock you up until I\u2019m dead and gone, understand?\u201d I stood there in shock, but apparently, my lack of response wasn\u2019t satisfactory. My father slammed his hand against the fridge next to my head, startling the daylights out of me. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d he repeated himself, shouting a little louder. I nodded feebly.</p><p>\tIt was as good as a slap to my face. He pulled me right off cloud nine, sending me plummeting back down to earth. \u201cHe has no business bringing his bad attitude onto this side of town, let alone while he gallivants around with my daughter. I won\u2019t have him dragging you down with him, got it? Find someone new,\u201d my father spit. I started to protest, I thought if I could make him see how sweet Chris really is he\u2019d change his mind, but he just raised a hand. That was his final word.</p><p>\tI\u2019d never seen him so angry. I knew he really meant business, seeing my father have an outburst like that was something out of my worst nightmare. I called Chris to ask him to come over that night. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the corner?\u201d he asked just like everything was normal. No, he was even happier than normal. I felt terrible holding in the heartbreak I knew I was about to cause, it was like watching a pony gallop and knowing they were about to be sent to the glue factory. \u201cN-no need for that,\u201d I said with a gulp. \u201cMy driveway is fine.\u201d</p><p>\tChris was quiet for a moment too long as the realization dawned on him. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked hesitantly. I was grateful he was on the other end of the line so he couldn\u2019t see the tears slipping down my cheeks as I assured him all I wanted to do was talk.</p><p>That drizzle from earlier had turned into a pouring thunderstorm. I met him outside before he knocked. If my parents knew he was here- well, I don\u2019t even want to think about that. He rushed up to me with his eyebrows creasing in the middle and soft eyes. Chris\u2019s mouth moved like he wanted to say something, but he wasn\u2019t sure what. He hugged me instead, holding me tight against his leather jacket that had grown sticky with the slickness of the rain.</p><p>\tThe weather was just as brooding and moody as I felt with its dark clouds and thundering sky. The second my face hit his shoulder, I started to cry. It wasn\u2019t the sweet, happy tears I had earlier either. I let out the kind of sobs that didn\u2019t allow you to catch your breath. Chris held me at arm\u2019s length, bending down so I\u2019d look him in the eye. \u201cDoll, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked innocently, so blissfully unaware of how everything was about to change.</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t see you anymore,\u201d I forced out between gasps. Chris pulled me into his chest again, resting his head on top of mine as he shushed me softly between kisses he pressed on top of my hair. \u201cWe\u2019re through, Chris,\u201d I said again like a confession with so much less conviction than before, muffled by his chest.</p><p>\tChris kept asking me why, but I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him. He\u2019d probably try to convince me otherwise, tell me that we can pretend like we split and just keep hiding it. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d understand that I couldn\u2019t keep living a lie and concealing my love for him. Instead of an answer, I just kept crying harder until he pulled away.</p><p>\tChris tucked a piece of hair behind my ear, rubbing my cheek with his thumb to brush away the tears. \u201cThis is it, huh?\u201d he asked with a sad smile. \u201cI knew you were too good to be true, doll,\u201d Chris sighed as I watched the tears well up in his eyes. He leaned toward me and I met him on my tiptoes like a magnet pulled us together for one last kiss. Without saying another word, he turned to leave fast. I hoped it wasn\u2019t since he didn\u2019t want me to see him cry, but I knew I\u2019d just broken his heart even more than mine.</p><p>\tI watched him as he straddled the seat of his motorcycle, the tears still dripping off of my chin as my chest heaved. My thumb began to twist the ring that still occupied my finger absentmindedly, causing me to realize I\u2019d forgotten to give Chris back the piece of himself he\u2019d lent me. I tried to chase him down to return the ring, but he\u2019d already started to drive away. He wanted to leave so quickly he hadn\u2019t bothered to spend time strapping his helmet on.</p><p>\tI stopped where the gravel met the street, realizing I\u2019d never be able to catch up with him now. \u201cSlow down!\u201d I called to him, absolutely defeated. Chris sped away, completely ignoring the dangerous conditions of the ground soaked from the rain. As he drove up to the corner far too quickly, I shouted for him to watch out so hard it made my throat sore.</p><p>\tI felt so helpless, watching as the bike slipped out from under Chris. It sent him flying so far down the road I couldn\u2019t see him past all the trees and brush, but there was this indistinguishable feeling in the very pit of my stomach I couldn\u2019t explain. I just knew he wasn\u2019t alright, that he\u2019d never be okay after an accident like that.</p><p>\tI hadn\u2019t realized I was crying again as I recounted the story to Barbara and Nancy, but a puddle quickly started to pool by the bottom of my glass. Barbara reached across the table and rested her hand on my shoulder in a failed attempt to comfort me, though it felt so feigned. I knew to her this was nothing more than a story to spread around school, the gossip somehow giving her a purpose. I felt sorry for her, living a life like that.</p><p>\tThat\u2019s exactly what she did, though. Within no time, it was like a wildfire spread throughout the student body. I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without everyone giving me the same look- one so full of pity with a hint of superiority. As if that\u2019s what they thought I deserved for letting Chris into my life as if he could only ever bring pain. I wanted to tear my hair out and scream at all of them that it was them my heart went out to for being so wrong as to think so little of Chris that even my grief was tainted by their pretension. He was so much more than anyone in this town ever gave him credit for, so much more than any single one of them, and I wanted them all to know it.</p><p>\tInstead, I resorted to chain smoking because, if I closed my eyes and imagined really hard, the taste of a cigarette between my lips almost reminded me of his kiss. I hung halfway out of my bedroom window as I smoked to hide the stench from my parents, reminiscing about everything we\u2019ve been through. All of the drag races we went to where we\u2019d walk together with his hand in my back pocket, the secret kisses stolen in the most deserted parts of the halls, the lollipops he always had on him since they reminded him of me. I\u2019d never forget Chris Evans, the leader of the pack.</p><hr><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a></p>",

I know she didn\u2019t really care- she just wanted something to run home and tell her mother so she\u2019d get praised for being nothing at all like me, even though she had a pregnancy scare last February.<br></p><p>\tI nodded with a hum of affirmation, stirring the straw around my coke. I really didn\u2019t care to see the intrigue in her eyes, trying to live vicariously through me as if it were some dream but still so frustratingly smug she wasn\u2019t in my shoes.</p><p>\t\u201cGee, it must be great riding with him,\u201d Nancy, Barbara\u2019s friend, said wistfully. It was an awfully bold dream coming from a girl without a skirt above her knees in her closet. She was like my mother, who thought even poodle skirts were offensive. The thought of Nancy, with her collared button down and cardigan, on the back of a motorcycle was almost comical. Barbara leaned in across the diner\u2019s linoleum table. \u201cIs he picking you up after school?\u201d she asked like it was a secret.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you writing a book?\u201d I snapped, although I knew Barbara didn\u2019t mean to hit a touchy subject. I retracted further into my side of the booth, biting my lip and trying to keep the tears from welling in my eyes again. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d start crying again and that was not something I wanted to give these two the satisfaction of seeing. Instead, I gripped my glass tight and sucked my drink down to avoid speaking.</p><p>\tBarbara leaned back to the white leather cushions of the booth. I realized I\u2019d made it awkward as their eyes darted back and forth to each other. \u201cWhere\u2019d you meet him, by the way?\u201d Nancy asked, just trying to be nice now.</p><p>\tI smiled involuntarily, that story would always lift my spirits. I toyed with the ring I\u2019d started wearing around my ring finger outside of the company of my parents as I told them about how I\u2019d been at the candy store, picking up something sweet for my younger sister on my way home from school.</p><p>\tThe chime of the bell caught my attention as someone walked into the store that was otherwise devoid of customers. To my surprise, it was Chris Evans. He was a year or so older in the grade above me, though everyone knew he wouldn\u2019t be graduating anytime soon. The gossip of the day was how he\u2019d been sent home for wearing blue jeans.</p><p>\tHe was still wearing them, coupled with a white t-shirt he was supposed to wear under his button down. Instead, he wore a black leather jacket over it, with his collar popped of course. His dark hair was slicked back with grease, save for a few strands that hung over his forehead. I recalled how many times my father, who was the local chief of police, told me this boy was trouble. He came from the wrong side of town, where I wasn\u2019t meant to be.</p><p>\tI knew my parents would be more than disappointed if I brought home anything less than a respectable young man from a well-off family, the kind who had a letter jacket and a college dream. After all, he was known to be the leader of this pack of rascals- the kinds of kids who chewed gum in class and stayed out past curfew. But there was just something about the way Chris smiled at me as he sauntered over to where I stood by the lollipops, with one hand tucked inside his pocket and the other one taking the rainbow-spiraled sucker I\u2019d been eyeing off the shelf.</p><p>\tHe must\u2019ve caught me staring. I felt my face grow hot with an unfamiliar flush of embarrassment, but Chris didn\u2019t seem to mind. He winked at me with one of those eyes that were too blue to be true. I realized later that was when I fell for him, hard and fast like the crazy kind of people who jumped out of planes. But then, I thought I was just intrigued. I watched him walk out the door and, as he turned around and smiled at me with this grin that gave me butterflies, I had a thought. He didn\u2019t seem like he was as bad as my father always said, I figured he may just be misunderstood.</p><p>\tWhen I left the store, I saw him leaning against a sleek black motorcycle. \u201cHey, doll,\u201d he said, sliding a comb through his hair. He reached into his pocket, taking out the brightly colored candy he\u2019d bought to me like an invitation. \u201cWanna ride home?\u201d Chris asked. My eyes almost popped out of my head. I was raised to think hot-rods were the devil, imagine if I came home on the back of this thing. It was almost laughable.</p><p>Then it occurred to me how many times I regretted not doing something I wanted because someone else told me not to for no good reason, so I took the lollipop from him.</p><p>\tI followed Chris\u2019s lead, climbing onto the back of his bike. He didn\u2019t have an extra helmet, but Chris didn\u2019t think twice about giving his to me. After how my father yelled about him and all the trouble he caused over his mashed potatoes at dinner, I was surprised. If Chris could prove that preconception wrong, who was he really?</p><p>\tFor the next few months, my life was almost like a montage. Chris was an absolute sweetheart. He\u2019d take me to the movies every Friday night, even though my parents thought I was studying at my friend\u2019s house. I remember once I gushed about how much I loved Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music, which elicited this smile from Chris I\u2019d grown used to. It was soft like he was appreciating my innocence. And sometimes even condescending, though I know he never meant it like that. He just wasn\u2019t used to the sweeter side of life, he didn\u2019t have my rose-colored glasses.</p><p>\tHe brought me to these back-alley places where guys would get together and talk about their rides. The girls there shocked me, with their high hair and skin-tight clothing. They wore pants and smoked and were everything my parents had nightmares about, but there was something so fascinating about them. Chris thought it was hilarious how, in this environment, I stuck out like a sore thumb in my long plaid dress considering it was usually him who was marginalized. I started to hide a pair of pants in my bag to change into when I went out with Chris and I grew to like the way cigarettes smelled because it reminded me of him. Then I started to smoke once in awhile, sometimes when we weren\u2019t even together because it made me feel like he was.</p><p>\tChris changed, too. Once, he met me at our usual spot in a button down, suspenders, and a tie that was too big for even his broad chest. He still looked incredible, even if it was sort of strange on him. I admired him in the glow of the streetlamps, feeling underdressed for once in our relationship. \u201cThought you and I could maybe go to the pier?\u201d Chris asked, looking at me through his eyelashes as if he was nervous I would say no. Instead, I ran and jumped into his arms, spinning so hard we almost tumbled into the hot-rod he\u2019d been driving lately. When he set me back down, I kissed Chris hard as a thank you. I don\u2019t think I could ever get used to the flips my stomach did every time his lips were on mine.</p><p>\tOn weekends, my friends and other kids from our school would gather at the pier down on the beach. They had a live band who played Buddy Holly\u2019s greatest hits, among others, and everyone would go down by the beach and cut a rug until they couldn\u2019t anymore. All of my friends went and it sounded like a ball, but I spent all of my free time lately with Chris. I knew he wanted to spend as little time around people from school as possible so when I mentioned it to him I didn\u2019t think much would come of it. Yet here he was, dressed to the nines with a flower in his hand.</p><p>\tIt was a blast. I tried to teach Chris how to do the jitterbug, even though he was awfully clumsy when it came to something like that. When I started laughing at him too much, he shut me up with a promise that he\u2019d show me what he was good at later, whispered in my ear so delicately even just his breath gave me goosebumps. He\u2019d led me to his cherry-colored car, sparking some kind of fire in my belly with that twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>\tWe stopped at the gas station so I could call my mom on the pay phone and tell her I\u2019d be spending the night at my friend Betty\u2019s place. The whole time, I was thinking about how I\u2019d never grow used to this excitement Chris made me feel. It was such an unfamiliar feeling, being daring enough to lie to my parents. But I was happier with Chris than I think they\u2019d ever understand.</p><p>\tHe goosed it until we were in the middle of nowhere, one hand on the wheel and the other on my thigh. Now <i>that</i> was something. We laid under the stars on grass that grew dewy as morning approached, smoking a little and talking a lot. When I got cold, Chris got his leather jacket from the car and wrapped me up in it, giving me that warm feeling you get from whiskey with his kisses. We never went all the way, but that night we got close. As I was telling Barbara and Nancy, I realized how deeply I regretted it and didn\u2019t at the same time.</p><p>\tChris stopped down the street so my parents wouldn\u2019t see to drop me off back at my house right before dawn. He opened the door for me, closing it before he leaned against it looking at me like I never thought anyone would. Chris seemed kinda funny with his greased hair and a smile softer than some might think he was capable of. I thought it was a great look on him. \u201cHey, doll\u2026\u201d Chris trailed off, looking between me and the ring he fumbled within his fingers. It was a simple, silver band he always wore- I wish I could tell you why.</p><p>\t\u201cI want you to have this,\u201d he said. There\u2019s no way to really describe the feeling of the air being knocked out of my lungs at the same time my heart jumped to my throat. It was just the kind of stuff that made people think they were invincible. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, but Chris kept talking for me.</p><p>\u201cI know we haven\u2019t known each other too long and that you don\u2019t think your parents would like me. Hell, sometimes it feels like the whole world is against a pretty kitten like you hanging around some no good nosebleed like me.\u201d Chris looked down at the rock he was kicking with his ratty Converse. I reached for his hand, ready to reassure him it wasn\u2019t true when his eyes snapped back to mine.</p><p>\t\u201cBut I love you a hell of a lot and I hope that\u2019s enough,\u201d Chris said, sincerity dripping off every word. \u201cSo I want you to have this,\u201d he repeated, lifting my hand he held in his and slipping the ring onto my finger. I held my hand close to my heart, staring down at the new addition. I pulled him into a tight hug, hoping he wouldn\u2019t mind the tear stains I made on his white shirt as I professed my love for him, too. Chris pulled away when cold drops of rain began to fall and told me I should get inside before I caught a cold. He kissed me one last time before climbing into his hot-rod. I watched him speed off into the sunrise and made a promise to myself that I wouldn\u2019t keep him a secret any longer.</p><p>\tLike I said, that kind of love can make you feel like nothing could touch you. When I walked in, my father was already sat at the head of the dining room table. He sipped his black coffee as he scanned the newspaper in his police uniform, probably just about to head off to work.</p><p>\t\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said, still unable to stop the smile from spreading across my cheeks. He humphed without looking up from his paper and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be home so early\u2026 and so chipper.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI have every right to be,\u201d I said, somehow without faltering. The nerves started to bubble in my stomach as I chewed my bottom lip. I knew I had to just get it over with, telling myself it would be like ripping off a bandaid. I faced the fridge since I couldn\u2019t bear to see his face. \u201cChris gave me his ring.\u201d<br><br>\tI heard his mug hit the table harder than before. I imagined the newspaper was covered in sloshed shrapnel. \u201cChristopher Evans?\u201d my father hissed, probably hoping I\u2019d laugh and tell him that was crazy, reassuring him it was some other Chris. I reached for the milk all the way in the back as I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\tWhen I turned around, my dad was already standing right behind me. He was bright red and seething, his fists clasped so tightly at his sides that his knuckles turned white. \u201cIf I ever even think that boy is around you again, I swear to God I will beat the shit out of him and lock you up until I\u2019m dead and gone, understand?\u201d I stood there in shock, but apparently, my lack of response wasn\u2019t satisfactory. My father slammed his hand against the fridge next to my head, startling the daylights out of me. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d he repeated himself, shouting a little louder. I nodded feebly.</p><p>\tIt was as good as a slap to my face. He pulled me right off cloud nine, sending me plummeting back down to earth. \u201cHe has no business bringing his bad attitude onto this side of town, let alone while he gallivants around with my daughter. I won\u2019t have him dragging you down with him, got it? Find someone new,\u201d my father spit. I started to protest, I thought if I could make him see how sweet Chris really is he\u2019d change his mind, but he just raised a hand. That was his final word.</p><p>\tI\u2019d never seen him so angry. I knew he really meant business, seeing my father have an outburst like that was something out of my worst nightmare. I called Chris to ask him to come over that night. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the corner?\u201d he asked just like everything was normal. No, he was even happier than normal. I felt terrible holding in the heartbreak I knew I was about to cause, it was like watching a pony gallop and knowing they were about to be sent to the glue factory. \u201cN-no need for that,\u201d I said with a gulp. \u201cMy driveway is fine.\u201d</p><p>\tChris was quiet for a moment too long as the realization dawned on him. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked hesitantly. I was grateful he was on the other end of the line so he couldn\u2019t see the tears slipping down my cheeks as I assured him all I wanted to do was talk.</p><p>That drizzle from earlier had turned into a pouring thunderstorm. I met him outside before he knocked. If my parents knew he was here- well, I don\u2019t even want to think about that. He rushed up to me with his eyebrows creasing in the middle and soft eyes. Chris\u2019s mouth moved like he wanted to say something, but he wasn\u2019t sure what. He hugged me instead, holding me tight against his leather jacket that had grown sticky with the slickness of the rain.</p><p>\tThe weather was just as brooding and moody as I felt with its dark clouds and thundering sky. The second my face hit his shoulder, I started to cry. It wasn\u2019t the sweet, happy tears I had earlier either. I let out the kind of sobs that didn\u2019t allow you to catch your breath. Chris held me at arm\u2019s length, bending down so I\u2019d look him in the eye. \u201cDoll, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked innocently, so blissfully unaware of how everything was about to change.</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t see you anymore,\u201d I forced out between gasps. Chris pulled me into his chest again, resting his head on top of mine as he shushed me softly between kisses he pressed on top of my hair. \u201cWe\u2019re through, Chris,\u201d I said again like a confession with so much less conviction than before, muffled by his chest.</p><p>\tChris kept asking me why, but I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him. He\u2019d probably try to convince me otherwise, tell me that we can pretend like we split and just keep hiding it. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d understand that I couldn\u2019t keep living a lie and concealing my love for him. Instead of an answer, I just kept crying harder until he pulled away.</p><p>\tChris tucked a piece of hair behind my ear, rubbing my cheek with his thumb to brush away the tears. \u201cThis is it, huh?\u201d he asked with a sad smile. \u201cI knew you were too good to be true, doll,\u201d Chris sighed as I watched the tears well up in his eyes. He leaned toward me and I met him on my tiptoes like a magnet pulled us together for one last kiss. Without saying another word, he turned to leave fast. I hoped it wasn\u2019t since he didn\u2019t want me to see him cry, but I knew I\u2019d just broken his heart even more than mine.</p><p>\tI watched him as he straddled the seat of his motorcycle, the tears still dripping off of my chin as my chest heaved. My thumb began to twist the ring that still occupied my finger absentmindedly, causing me to realize I\u2019d forgotten to give Chris back the piece of himself he\u2019d lent me. I tried to chase him down to return the ring, but he\u2019d already started to drive away. He wanted to leave so quickly he hadn\u2019t bothered to spend time strapping his helmet on.</p><p>\tI stopped where the gravel met the street, realizing I\u2019d never be able to catch up with him now. \u201cSlow down!\u201d I called to him, absolutely defeated. Chris sped away, completely ignoring the dangerous conditions of the ground soaked from the rain. As he drove up to the corner far too quickly, I shouted for him to watch out so hard it made my throat sore.</p><p>\tI felt so helpless, watching as the bike slipped out from under Chris. It sent him flying so far down the road I couldn\u2019t see him past all the trees and brush, but there was this indistinguishable feeling in the very pit of my stomach I couldn\u2019t explain. I just knew he wasn\u2019t alright, that he\u2019d never be okay after an accident like that.</p><p>\tI hadn\u2019t realized I was crying again as I recounted the story to Barbara and Nancy, but a puddle quickly started to pool by the bottom of my glass. Barbara reached across the table and rested her hand on my shoulder in a failed attempt to comfort me, though it felt so feigned. I knew to her this was nothing more than a story to spread around school, the gossip somehow giving her a purpose. I felt sorry for her, living a life like that.</p><p>\tThat\u2019s exactly what she did, though. Within no time, it was like a wildfire spread throughout the student body.

As if that\u2019s what they thought I deserved for letting Chris into my life as if he could only ever bring pain. I wanted to tear my hair out and scream at all of them that it was them my heart went out to for being so wrong as to think so little of Chris that even my grief was tainted by their pretension.

I know she didn\u2019t really care- she just wanted something to run home and tell her mother so she\u2019d get praised for being nothing at all like me, even though she had a pregnancy scare last February.<br></p><p>\tI nodded with a hum of affirmation, stirring the straw around my coke. I really didn\u2019t care to see the intrigue in her eyes, trying to live vicariously through me as if it were some dream but still so frustratingly smug she wasn\u2019t in my shoes.</p><p>\t\u201cGee, it must be great riding with him,\u201d Nancy, Barbara\u2019s friend, said wistfully. It was an awfully bold dream coming from a girl without a skirt above her knees in her closet. She was like my mother, who thought even poodle skirts were offensive. The thought of Nancy, with her collared button down and cardigan, on the back of a motorcycle was almost comical. Barbara leaned in across the diner\u2019s linoleum table. \u201cIs he picking you up after school?\u201d she asked like it was a secret.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you writing a book?\u201d I snapped, although I knew Barbara didn\u2019t mean to hit a touchy subject. I retracted further into my side of the booth, biting my lip and trying to keep the tears from welling in my eyes again. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d start crying again and that was not something I wanted to give these two the satisfaction of seeing. Instead, I gripped my glass tight and sucked my drink down to avoid speaking.</p><p>\tBarbara leaned back to the white leather cushions of the booth. I realized I\u2019d made it awkward as their eyes darted back and forth to each other. \u201cWhere\u2019d you meet him, by the way?\u201d Nancy asked, just trying to be nice now.</p><p>\tI smiled involuntarily, that story would always lift my spirits. I toyed with the ring I\u2019d started wearing around my ring finger outside of the company of my parents as I told them about how I\u2019d been at the candy store, picking up something sweet for my younger sister on my way home from school.</p><p>\tThe chime of the bell caught my attention as someone walked into the store that was otherwise devoid of customers. To my surprise, it was Chris Evans. He was a year or so older in the grade above me, though everyone knew he wouldn\u2019t be graduating anytime soon. The gossip of the day was how he\u2019d been sent home for wearing blue jeans.</p><p>\tHe was still wearing them, coupled with a white t-shirt he was supposed to wear under his button down. Instead, he wore a black leather jacket over it, with his collar popped of course. His dark hair was slicked back with grease, save for a few strands that hung over his forehead. I recalled how many times my father, who was the local chief of police, told me this boy was trouble. He came from the wrong side of town, where I wasn\u2019t meant to be.</p><p>\tI knew my parents would be more than disappointed if I brought home anything less than a respectable young man from a well-off family, the kind who had a letter jacket and a college dream. After all, he was known to be the leader of this pack of rascals- the kinds of kids who chewed gum in class and stayed out past curfew. But there was just something about the way Chris smiled at me as he sauntered over to where I stood by the lollipops, with one hand tucked inside his pocket and the other one taking the rainbow-spiraled sucker I\u2019d been eyeing off the shelf.</p><p>\tHe must\u2019ve caught me staring. I felt my face grow hot with an unfamiliar flush of embarrassment, but Chris didn\u2019t seem to mind. He winked at me with one of those eyes that were too blue to be true. I realized later that was when I fell for him, hard and fast like the crazy kind of people who jumped out of planes. But then, I thought I was just intrigued. I watched him walk out the door and, as he turned around and smiled at me with this grin that gave me butterflies, I had a thought. He didn\u2019t seem like he was as bad as my father always said, I figured he may just be misunderstood.</p><p>\tWhen I left the store, I saw him leaning against a sleek black motorcycle. \u201cHey, doll,\u201d he said, sliding a comb through his hair. He reached into his pocket, taking out the brightly colored candy he\u2019d bought to me like an invitation. \u201cWanna ride home?\u201d Chris asked. My eyes almost popped out of my head. I was raised to think hot-rods were the devil, imagine if I came home on the back of this thing. It was almost laughable.</p><p>Then it occurred to me how many times I regretted not doing something I wanted because someone else told me not to for no good reason, so I took the lollipop from him.</p><p>\tI followed Chris\u2019s lead, climbing onto the back of his bike. He didn\u2019t have an extra helmet, but Chris didn\u2019t think twice about giving his to me. After how my father yelled about him and all the trouble he caused over his mashed potatoes at dinner, I was surprised. If Chris could prove that preconception wrong, who was he really?</p><p>\tFor the next few months, my life was almost like a montage. Chris was an absolute sweetheart. He\u2019d take me to the movies every Friday night, even though my parents thought I was studying at my friend\u2019s house. I remember once I gushed about how much I loved Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music, which elicited this smile from Chris I\u2019d grown used to. It was soft like he was appreciating my innocence. And sometimes even condescending, though I know he never meant it like that. He just wasn\u2019t used to the sweeter side of life, he didn\u2019t have my rose-colored glasses.</p><p>\tHe brought me to these back-alley places where guys would get together and talk about their rides. The girls there shocked me, with their high hair and skin-tight clothing. They wore pants and smoked and were everything my parents had nightmares about, but there was something so fascinating about them. Chris thought it was hilarious how, in this environment, I stuck out like a sore thumb in my long plaid dress considering it was usually him who was marginalized. I started to hide a pair of pants in my bag to change into when I went out with Chris and I grew to like the way cigarettes smelled because it reminded me of him. Then I started to smoke once in awhile, sometimes when we weren\u2019t even together because it made me feel like he was.</p><p>\tChris changed, too. Once, he met me at our usual spot in a button down, suspenders, and a tie that was too big for even his broad chest. He still looked incredible, even if it was sort of strange on him. I admired him in the glow of the streetlamps, feeling underdressed for once in our relationship. \u201cThought you and I could maybe go to the pier?\u201d Chris asked, looking at me through his eyelashes as if he was nervous I would say no. Instead, I ran and jumped into his arms, spinning so hard we almost tumbled into the hot-rod he\u2019d been driving lately. When he set me back down, I kissed Chris hard as a thank you. I don\u2019t think I could ever get used to the flips my stomach did every time his lips were on mine.</p><p>\tOn weekends, my friends and other kids from our school would gather at the pier down on the beach. They had a live band who played Buddy Holly\u2019s greatest hits, among others, and everyone would go down by the beach and cut a rug until they couldn\u2019t anymore. All of my friends went and it sounded like a ball, but I spent all of my free time lately with Chris. I knew he wanted to spend as little time around people from school as possible so when I mentioned it to him I didn\u2019t think much would come of it. Yet here he was, dressed to the nines with a flower in his hand.</p><p>\tIt was a blast. I tried to teach Chris how to do the jitterbug, even though he was awfully clumsy when it came to something like that. When I started laughing at him too much, he shut me up with a promise that he\u2019d show me what he was good at later, whispered in my ear so delicately even just his breath gave me goosebumps. He\u2019d led me to his cherry-colored car, sparking some kind of fire in my belly with that twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>\tWe stopped at the gas station so I could call my mom on the pay phone and tell her I\u2019d be spending the night at my friend Betty\u2019s place. The whole time, I was thinking about how I\u2019d never grow used to this excitement Chris made me feel. It was such an unfamiliar feeling, being daring enough to lie to my parents. But I was happier with Chris than I think they\u2019d ever understand.</p><p>\tHe goosed it until we were in the middle of nowhere, one hand on the wheel and the other on my thigh. Now <i>that</i> was something. We laid under the stars on grass that grew dewy as morning approached, smoking a little and talking a lot. When I got cold, Chris got his leather jacket from the car and wrapped me up in it, giving me that warm feeling you get from whiskey with his kisses. We never went all the way, but that night we got close. As I was telling Barbara and Nancy, I realized how deeply I regretted it and didn\u2019t at the same time.</p><p>\tChris stopped down the street so my parents wouldn\u2019t see to drop me off back at my house right before dawn. He opened the door for me, closing it before he leaned against it looking at me like I never thought anyone would. Chris seemed kinda funny with his greased hair and a smile softer than some might think he was capable of. I thought it was a great look on him. \u201cHey, doll\u2026\u201d Chris trailed off, looking between me and the ring he fumbled within his fingers. It was a simple, silver band he always wore- I wish I could tell you why.</p><p>\t\u201cI want you to have this,\u201d he said. There\u2019s no way to really describe the feeling of the air being knocked out of my lungs at the same time my heart jumped to my throat. It was just the kind of stuff that made people think they were invincible. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, but Chris kept talking for me.</p><p>\u201cI know we haven\u2019t known each other too long and that you don\u2019t think your parents would like me. Hell, sometimes it feels like the whole world is against a pretty kitten like you hanging around some no good nosebleed like me.\u201d Chris looked down at the rock he was kicking with his ratty Converse. I reached for his hand, ready to reassure him it wasn\u2019t true when his eyes snapped back to mine.</p><p>\t\u201cBut I love you a hell of a lot and I hope that\u2019s enough,\u201d Chris said, sincerity dripping off every word. \u201cSo I want you to have this,\u201d he repeated, lifting my hand he held in his and slipping the ring onto my finger. I held my hand close to my heart, staring down at the new addition. I pulled him into a tight hug, hoping he wouldn\u2019t mind the tear stains I made on his white shirt as I professed my love for him, too. Chris pulled away when cold drops of rain began to fall and told me I should get inside before I caught a cold. He kissed me one last time before climbing into his hot-rod. I watched him speed off into the sunrise and made a promise to myself that I wouldn\u2019t keep him a secret any longer.</p><p>\tLike I said, that kind of love can make you feel like nothing could touch you. When I walked in, my father was already sat at the head of the dining room table. He sipped his black coffee as he scanned the newspaper in his police uniform, probably just about to head off to work.</p><p>\t\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said, still unable to stop the smile from spreading across my cheeks. He humphed without looking up from his paper and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be home so early\u2026 and so chipper.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI have every right to be,\u201d I said, somehow without faltering. The nerves started to bubble in my stomach as I chewed my bottom lip. I knew I had to just get it over with, telling myself it would be like ripping off a bandaid. I faced the fridge since I couldn\u2019t bear to see his face. \u201cChris gave me his ring.\u201d<br><br>\tI heard his mug hit the table harder than before. I imagined the newspaper was covered in sloshed shrapnel. \u201cChristopher Evans?\u201d my father hissed, probably hoping I\u2019d laugh and tell him that was crazy, reassuring him it was some other Chris. I reached for the milk all the way in the back as I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\tWhen I turned around, my dad was already standing right behind me. He was bright red and seething, his fists clasped so tightly at his sides that his knuckles turned white. \u201cIf I ever even think that boy is around you again, I swear to God I will beat the shit out of him and lock you up until I\u2019m dead and gone, understand?\u201d I stood there in shock, but apparently, my lack of response wasn\u2019t satisfactory. My father slammed his hand against the fridge next to my head, startling the daylights out of me. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d he repeated himself, shouting a little louder. I nodded feebly.</p><p>\tIt was as good as a slap to my face. He pulled me right off cloud nine, sending me plummeting back down to earth. \u201cHe has no business bringing his bad attitude onto this side of town, let alone while he gallivants around with my daughter. I won\u2019t have him dragging you down with him, got it? Find someone new,\u201d my father spit. I started to protest, I thought if I could make him see how sweet Chris really is he\u2019d change his mind, but he just raised a hand. That was his final word.</p><p>\tI\u2019d never seen him so angry. I knew he really meant business, seeing my father have an outburst like that was something out of my worst nightmare. I called Chris to ask him to come over that night. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the corner?\u201d he asked just like everything was normal. No, he was even happier than normal. I felt terrible holding in the heartbreak I knew I was about to cause, it was like watching a pony gallop and knowing they were about to be sent to the glue factory. \u201cN-no need for that,\u201d I said with a gulp. \u201cMy driveway is fine.\u201d</p><p>\tChris was quiet for a moment too long as the realization dawned on him. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked hesitantly. I was grateful he was on the other end of the line so he couldn\u2019t see the tears slipping down my cheeks as I assured him all I wanted to do was talk.</p><p>That drizzle from earlier had turned into a pouring thunderstorm. I met him outside before he knocked. If my parents knew he was here- well, I don\u2019t even want to think about that. He rushed up to me with his eyebrows creasing in the middle and soft eyes. Chris\u2019s mouth moved like he wanted to say something, but he wasn\u2019t sure what. He hugged me instead, holding me tight against his leather jacket that had grown sticky with the slickness of the rain.</p><p>\tThe weather was just as brooding and moody as I felt with its dark clouds and thundering sky. The second my face hit his shoulder, I started to cry. It wasn\u2019t the sweet, happy tears I had earlier either. I let out the kind of sobs that didn\u2019t allow you to catch your breath. Chris held me at arm\u2019s length, bending down so I\u2019d look him in the eye. \u201cDoll, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked innocently, so blissfully unaware of how everything was about to change.</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t see you anymore,\u201d I forced out between gasps. Chris pulled me into his chest again, resting his head on top of mine as he shushed me softly between kisses he pressed on top of my hair. \u201cWe\u2019re through, Chris,\u201d I said again like a confession with so much less conviction than before, muffled by his chest.</p><p>\tChris kept asking me why, but I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him. He\u2019d probably try to convince me otherwise, tell me that we can pretend like we split and just keep hiding it. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d understand that I couldn\u2019t keep living a lie and concealing my love for him. Instead of an answer, I just kept crying harder until he pulled away.</p><p>\tChris tucked a piece of hair behind my ear, rubbing my cheek with his thumb to brush away the tears. \u201cThis is it, huh?\u201d he asked with a sad smile. \u201cI knew you were too good to be true, doll,\u201d Chris sighed as I watched the tears well up in his eyes. He leaned toward me and I met him on my tiptoes like a magnet pulled us together for one last kiss. Without saying another word, he turned to leave fast. I hoped it wasn\u2019t since he didn\u2019t want me to see him cry, but I knew I\u2019d just broken his heart even more than mine.</p><p>\tI watched him as he straddled the seat of his motorcycle, the tears still dripping off of my chin as my chest heaved. My thumb began to twist the ring that still occupied my finger absentmindedly, causing me to realize I\u2019d forgotten to give Chris back the piece of himself he\u2019d lent me. I tried to chase him down to return the ring, but he\u2019d already started to drive away. He wanted to leave so quickly he hadn\u2019t bothered to spend time strapping his helmet on.</p><p>\tI stopped where the gravel met the street, realizing I\u2019d never be able to catch up with him now. \u201cSlow down!\u201d I called to him, absolutely defeated. Chris sped away, completely ignoring the dangerous conditions of the ground soaked from the rain. As he drove up to the corner far too quickly, I shouted for him to watch out so hard it made my throat sore.</p><p>\tI felt so helpless, watching as the bike slipped out from under Chris. It sent him flying so far down the road I couldn\u2019t see him past all the trees and brush, but there was this indistinguishable feeling in the very pit of my stomach I couldn\u2019t explain. I just knew he wasn\u2019t alright, that he\u2019d never be okay after an accident like that.</p><p>\tI hadn\u2019t realized I was crying again as I recounted the story to Barbara and Nancy, but a puddle quickly started to pool by the bottom of my glass. Barbara reached across the table and rested her hand on my shoulder in a failed attempt to comfort me, though it felt so feigned. I knew to her this was nothing more than a story to spread around school, the gossip somehow giving her a purpose. I felt sorry for her, living a life like that.</p><p>\tThat\u2019s exactly what she did, though. Within no time, it was like a wildfire spread throughout the student body. I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without everyone giving me the same look- one so full of pity with a hint of superiority. As if that\u2019s what they thought I deserved for letting Chris into my life as if he could only ever bring pain. I wanted to tear my hair out and scream at all of them that it was them my heart went out to for being so wrong as to think so little of Chris that even my grief was tainted by their pretension. He was so much more than anyone in this town ever gave him credit for, so much more than any single one of them, and I wanted them all to know it.</p><p>\tInstead, I resorted to chain smoking because, if I closed my eyes and imagined really hard, the taste of a cigarette between my lips almost reminded me of his kiss. I hung halfway out of my bedroom window as I smoked to hide the stench from my parents, reminiscing about everything we\u2019ve been through. All of the drag races we went to where we\u2019d walk together with his hand in my back pocket, the secret kisses stolen in the most deserted parts of the halls, the lollipops he always had on him since they reminded him of me. I\u2019d never forget Chris Evans, the leader of the pack.</p><hr><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a></p>",

The gossip of the day was how he&rsquo;d been sent home for wearing blue jeans.</p><p>\tHe was still wearing them, coupled with a white t-shirt he was supposed to wear under his button down. Instead, he wore a black leather jacket over it, with his collar popped of course. His dark hair was slicked back with grease, save for a few strands that hung over his forehead. I recalled how many times my father, who was the local chief of police, told me this boy was trouble. He came from the wrong side of town, where I wasn&rsquo;t meant to be.</p><p>\tI knew my parents would be more than disappointed if I brought home anything less than a respectable young man from a well-off family, the kind who had a letter jacket and a college dream. After all, he was known to be the leader of this pack of rascals- the kinds of kids who chewed gum in class and stayed out past curfew. But there was just something about the way Chris smiled at me as he sauntered over to where I stood by the lollipops, with one hand tucked inside his pocket and the other one taking the rainbow-spiraled sucker I&rsquo;d been eyeing off the shelf.</p><p>\tHe must&rsquo;ve caught me staring. I felt my face grow hot with an unfamiliar flush of embarrassment, but Chris didn&rsquo;t seem to mind. He winked at me with one of those eyes that were too blue to be true. I realized later that was when I fell for him, hard and fast like the crazy kind of people who jumped out of planes. But then, I thought I was just intrigued. I watched him walk out the door and, as he turned around and smiled at me with this grin that gave me butterflies, I had a thought. He didn&rsquo;t seem like he was as bad as my father always said, I figured he may just be misunderstood.</p><p>\tWhen I left the store, I saw him leaning against a sleek black motorcycle. &ldquo;Hey, doll,&rdquo; he said, sliding a comb through his hair. He reached into his pocket, taking out the brightly colored candy he&rsquo;d bought to me like an invitation. &ldquo;Wanna ride home?&rdquo; Chris asked. My eyes almost popped out of my head. I was raised to think hot-rods were the devil, imagine if I came home on the back of this thing. It was almost laughable.</p><p>Then it occurred to me how many times I regretted not doing something I wanted because someone else told me not to for no good reason, so I took the lollipop from him.</p><p>\tI followed Chris&rsquo;s lead, climbing onto the back of his bike. He didn&rsquo;t have an extra helmet, but Chris didn&rsquo;t think twice about giving his to me. After how my father yelled about him and all the trouble he caused over his mashed potatoes at dinner, I was surprised. If Chris could prove that preconception wrong, who was he really?</p><p>\tFor the next few months, my life was almost like a montage. Chris was an absolute sweetheart. He&rsquo;d take me to the movies every Friday night, even though my parents thought I was studying at my friend&rsquo;s house. I remember once I gushed about how much I loved Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music, which elicited this smile from Chris I&rsquo;d grown used to. It was soft like he was appreciating my innocence. And sometimes even condescending, though I know he never meant it like that. He just wasn&rsquo;t used to the sweeter side of life, he didn&rsquo;t have my rose-colored glasses.</p><p>\tHe brought me to these back-alley places where guys would get together and talk about their rides. The girls there shocked me, with their high hair and skin-tight clothing. They wore pants and smoked and were everything my parents had nightmares about, but there was something so fascinating about them. Chris thought it was hilarious how, in this environment, I stuck out like a sore thumb in my long plaid dress considering it was usually him who was marginalized. I started to hide a pair of pants in my bag to change into when I went out with Chris and I grew to like the way cigarettes smelled because it reminded me of him. Then I started to smoke once in awhile, sometimes when we weren&rsquo;t even together because it made me feel like he was.</p><p>\tChris changed, too. Once, he met me at our usual spot in a button down, suspenders, and a tie that was too big for even his broad chest. He still looked incredible, even if it was sort of strange on him. I admired him in the glow of the streetlamps, feeling underdressed for once in our relationship. &ldquo;Thought you and I could maybe go to the pier?&rdquo; Chris asked, looking at me through his eyelashes as if he was nervous I would say no. Instead, I ran and jumped into his arms, spinning so hard we almost tumbled into the hot-rod he&rsquo;d been driving lately. When he set me back down, I kissed Chris hard as a thank you. I don&rsquo;t think I could ever get used to the flips my stomach did every time his lips were on mine.</p><p>\tOn weekends, my friends and other kids from our school would gather at the pier down on the beach. They had a live band who played Buddy Holly&rsquo;s greatest hits, among others, and everyone would go down by the beach and cut a rug until they couldn&rsquo;t anymore. All of my friends went and it sounded like a ball, but I spent all of my free time lately with Chris. I knew he wanted to spend as little time around people from school as possible so when I mentioned it to him I didn&rsquo;t think much would come of it. Yet here he was, dressed to the nines with a flower in his hand.</p><p>\tIt was a blast. I tried to teach Chris how to do the jitterbug, even though he was awfully clumsy when it came to something like that. When I started laughing at him too much, he shut me up with a promise that he&rsquo;d show me what he was good at later, whispered in my ear so delicately even just his breath gave me goosebumps. He&rsquo;d led me to his cherry-colored car, sparking some kind of fire in my belly with that twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>\tWe stopped at the gas station so I could call my mom on the pay phone and tell her I&rsquo;d be spending the night at my friend Betty&rsquo;s place. The whole time, I was thinking about how I&rsquo;d never grow used to this excitement Chris made me feel. It was such an unfamiliar feeling, being daring enough to lie to my parents. But I was happier with Chris than I think they&rsquo;d ever understand.</p><p>\tHe goosed it until we were in the middle of nowhere, one hand on the wheel and the other on my thigh. Now <i>that</i> was something. We laid under the stars on grass that grew dewy as morning approached, smoking a little and talking a lot. When I got cold, Chris got his leather jacket from the car and wrapped me up in it, giving me that warm feeling you get from whiskey with his kisses. We never went all the way, but that night we got close. As I was telling Barbara and Nancy, I realized how deeply I regretted it and didn&rsquo;t at the same time.</p><p>\tChris stopped down the street so my parents wouldn&rsquo;t see to drop me off back at my house right before dawn. He opened the door for me, closing it before he leaned against it looking at me like I never thought anyone would. Chris seemed kinda funny with his greased hair and a smile softer than some might think he was capable of. I thought it was a great look on him. &ldquo;Hey, doll&hellip;&rdquo; Chris trailed off, looking between me and the ring he fumbled within his fingers. It was a simple, silver band he always wore- I wish I could tell you why.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I want you to have this,&rdquo; he said. There&rsquo;s no way to really describe the feeling of the air being knocked out of my lungs at the same time my heart jumped to my throat. It was just the kind of stuff that made people think they were invincible. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say, but Chris kept talking for me.</p><p>&ldquo;I know we haven&rsquo;t known each other too long and that you don&rsquo;t think your parents would like me. Hell, sometimes it feels like the whole world is against a pretty kitten like you hanging around some no good nosebleed like me.&rdquo; Chris looked down at the rock he was kicking with his ratty Converse. I reached for his hand, ready to reassure him it wasn&rsquo;t true when his eyes snapped back to mine.</p><p>\t&ldquo;But I love you a hell of a lot and I hope that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Chris said, sincerity dripping off every word. &ldquo;So I want you to have this,&rdquo; he repeated, lifting my hand he held in his and slipping the ring onto my finger. I held my hand close to my heart, staring down at the new addition. I pulled him into a tight hug, hoping he wouldn&rsquo;t mind the tear stains I made on his white shirt as I professed my love for him, too. Chris pulled away when cold drops of rain began to fall and told me I should get inside before I caught a cold. He kissed me one last time before climbing into his hot-rod. I watched him speed off into the sunrise and made a promise to myself that I wouldn&rsquo;t keep him a secret any longer.</p><p>\tLike I said, that kind of love can make you feel like nothing could touch you. When I walked in, my father was already sat at the head of the dining room table. He sipped his black coffee as he scanned the newspaper in his police uniform, probably just about to head off to work.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; I said, still unable to stop the smile from spreading across my cheeks. He humphed without looking up from his paper and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be home so early&hellip; and so chipper.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I have every right to be,&rdquo; I said, somehow without faltering. The nerves started to bubble in my stomach as I chewed my bottom lip. I knew I had to just get it over with, telling myself it would be like ripping off a bandaid. I faced the fridge since I couldn&rsquo;t bear to see his face. &ldquo;Chris gave me his ring.&rdquo;<br /><br />\tI heard his mug hit the table harder than before. I imagined the newspaper was covered in sloshed shrapnel. &ldquo;Christopher Evans?&rdquo; my father hissed, probably hoping I&rsquo;d laugh and tell him that was crazy, reassuring him it was some other Chris. I reached for the milk all the way in the back as I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one.&rdquo;</p><p>\tWhen I turned around, my dad was already standing right behind me. He was bright red and seething, his fists clasped so tightly at his sides that his knuckles turned white. &ldquo;If I ever even think that boy is around you again, I swear to God I will beat the shit out of him and lock you up until I&rsquo;m dead and gone, understand?&rdquo; I stood there in shock, but apparently, my lack of response wasn&rsquo;t satisfactory. My father slammed his hand against the fridge next to my head, startling the daylights out of me. &ldquo;Understand?&rdquo; he repeated himself, shouting a little louder. I nodded feebly.</p><p>\tIt was as good as a slap to my face. He pulled me right off cloud nine, sending me plummeting back down to earth. &ldquo;He has no business bringing his bad attitude onto this side of town, let alone while he gallivants around with my daughter. I won&rsquo;t have him dragging you down with him, got it? Find someone new,&rdquo; my father spit. I started to protest, I thought if I could make him see how sweet Chris really is he&rsquo;d change his mind, but he just raised a hand. That was his final word.</p><p>\tI&rsquo;d never seen him so angry. I knew he really meant business, seeing my father have an outburst like that was something out of my worst nightmare. I called Chris to ask him to come over that night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you at the corner?&rdquo; he asked just like everything was normal. No, he was even happier than normal. I felt terrible holding in the heartbreak I knew I was about to cause, it was like watching a pony gallop and knowing they were about to be sent to the glue factory. &ldquo;N-no need for that,&rdquo; I said with a gulp. &ldquo;My driveway is fine.&rdquo;</p><p>\tChris was quiet for a moment too long as the realization dawned on him. &ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; he asked hesitantly. I was grateful he was on the other end of the line so he couldn&rsquo;t see the tears slipping down my cheeks as I assured him all I wanted to do was talk.</p><p>That drizzle from earlier had turned into a pouring thunderstorm. I met him outside before he knocked. If my parents knew he was here- well, I don&rsquo;t even want to think about that. He rushed up to me with his eyebrows creasing in the middle and soft eyes. Chris&rsquo;s mouth moved like he wanted to say something, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure what. He hugged me instead, holding me tight against his leather jacket that had grown sticky with the slickness of the rain.</p><p>\tThe weather was just as brooding and moody as I felt with its dark clouds and thundering sky. The second my face hit his shoulder, I started to cry. It wasn&rsquo;t the sweet, happy tears I had earlier either. I let out the kind of sobs that didn&rsquo;t allow you to catch your breath. Chris held me at arm&rsquo;s length, bending down so I&rsquo;d look him in the eye. &ldquo;Doll, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked innocently, so blissfully unaware of how everything was about to change.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you anymore,&rdquo; I forced out between gasps. Chris pulled me into his chest again, resting his head on top of mine as he shushed me softly between kisses he pressed on top of my hair. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re through, Chris,&rdquo; I said again like a confession with so much less conviction than before, muffled by his chest.</p><p>\tChris kept asking me why, but I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell him. He&rsquo;d probably try to convince me otherwise, tell me that we can pretend like we split and just keep hiding it. I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d understand that I couldn&rsquo;t keep living a lie and concealing my love for him. Instead of an answer, I just kept crying harder until he pulled away.</p><p>\tChris tucked a piece of hair behind my ear, rubbing my cheek with his thumb to brush away the tears. &ldquo;This is it, huh?&rdquo; he asked with a sad smile. &ldquo;I knew you were too good to be true, doll,&rdquo; Chris sighed as I watched the tears well up in his eyes. He leaned toward me and I met him on my tiptoes like a magnet pulled us together for one last kiss. Without saying another word, he turned to leave fast. I hoped it wasn&rsquo;t since he didn&rsquo;t want me to see him cry, but I knew I&rsquo;d just broken his heart even more than mine.</p><p>\tI watched him as he straddled the seat of his motorcycle, the tears still dripping off of my chin as my chest heaved. My thumb began to twist the ring that still occupied my finger absentmindedly, causing me to realize I&rsquo;d forgotten to give Chris back the piece of himself he&rsquo;d lent me. I tried to chase him down to return the ring, but he&rsquo;d already started to drive away. He wanted to leave so quickly he hadn&rsquo;t bothered to spend time strapping his helmet on.</p><p>\tI stopped where the gravel met the street, realizing I&rsquo;d never be able to catch up with him now. &ldquo;Slow down!&rdquo; I called to him, absolutely defeated. Chris sped away, completely ignoring the dangerous conditions of the ground soaked from the rain. As he drove up to the corner far too quickly, I shouted for him to watch out so hard it made my throat sore.</p><p>\tI felt so helpless, watching as the bike slipped out from under Chris. It sent him flying so far down the road I couldn&rsquo;t see him past all the trees and brush, but there was this indistinguishable feeling in the very pit of my stomach I couldn&rsquo;t explain. I just knew he wasn&rsquo;t alright, that he&rsquo;d never be okay after an accident like that.</p><p>\tI hadn&rsquo;t realized I was crying again as I recounted the story to Barbara and Nancy, but a puddle quickly started to pool by the bottom of my glass. Barbara reached across the table and rested her hand on my shoulder in a failed attempt to comfort me, though it felt so feigned. I knew to her this was nothing more than a story to spread around school, the gossip somehow giving her a purpose. I felt sorry for her, living a life like that.</p><p>\tThat&rsquo;s exactly what she did, though. Within no time, it was like a wildfire spread throughout the student body. I couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere without everyone giving me the same look- one so full of pity with a hint of superiority. As if that&rsquo;s what they thought I deserved for letting Chris into my life as if he could only ever bring pain. I wanted to tear my hair out and scream at all of them that it was them my heart went out to for being so wrong as to think so little of Chris that even my grief was tainted by their pretension. He was so much more than anyone in this town ever gave him credit for, so much more than any single one of them, and I wanted them all to know it.</p><p>\tInstead, I resorted to chain smoking because, if I closed my eyes and imagined really hard, the taste of a cigarette between my lips almost reminded me of his kiss. I hung halfway out of my bedroom window as I smoked to hide the stench from my parents, reminiscing about everything we&rsquo;ve been through. All of the drag races we went to where we&rsquo;d walk together with his hand in my back pocket, the secret kisses stolen in the most deserted parts of the halls, the lollipops he always had on him since they reminded him of me. I&rsquo;d never forget Chris Evans, the leader of the pack.</p><hr /><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a></p>",
