He was staring at you with a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>He sighed and shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that you live here.\u201d</p><p>You sighed back, looking around, \u201cWhere\u2019s our ride?\u201d</p><p>He nodded towards the bike in front of you and you snorted, \u201cYou scared to hold on, doll?\u201d He smirked as he threw you a helmet.</p><p>You laughed and shook your head, \u201cI\u2019m not, are you?\u201d You took the keys off his belt loop and threw your leg over the bike, looking back.</p><p>He laughed, putting his helmet on and throwing his leg over- scooting behind you rather closely, holding onto your sides.</p><p>You rode off and quickly moved towards the quinjet, a little too aware of the placement of his hands. Getting there, you waited for him to move and it took him a minute.</p><p>\u201cCome on, gramps, I wanna get there today.\u201d You mocked with a small smirk and felt him rumble from behind you.</p><p>It was a few hours off and the ride turned out to have a lot of nagging and teasing which took your mind off of darker thoughts that seemed to be edging in today, as much as you wished they wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Arriving at the hotel, you both went in and got situated in the room- the one you would be looking out of. </p><p>No one had told you it only had one bed in it, or that the bed was going to be ten feet away from the lookout spot where you were supposed to be gaining intel from.</p><p>You sighed as you threw your bag down and raided the mini fridge, grabbing an expensive can of beer and sitting down in a chair to look through the room service menu.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d You asked without peering up over the menu.</p><p>\u201cSure- just get two of whatever you\u2019re getting. That includes that drink of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right up.\u201d You winked over to him before turning towards the phone and placing an order. You walked over towards the mini fridge again and grabbed another can and set it down in front of Bucky, helping him with the equipment.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s going to be on first watch?\u201d Bucky asked, opening his can after you were done setting up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on both watches.\u201d You mumbled, raising the can to your lips again.</p><p>He chuckled before realizing you were serious, \u201cOh come on, doll. You have to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>You sighed and thanked room service for their impeccable timing, not wanting to start an argument. You stood and strode over to the door, opening it and bringing the cart inside yourself and nodding a thanks before bolting the door shut again.</p><p>Looking under the lids, you laughed. \u201cI think I went a little overboard with the quantity.\u201d</p><p>Bucky stood and rubbed his hands together, \u201cGood, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>You went back to joking and eating and drinking while keeping a lookout and soon it got late.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take first watch, okay?\u201d Bucky stated, nodding towards the bed. \u201cAt least try for a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>You sighed, going to the bathroom to get ready for bed. You came out and laid down, staring at the end table for a while. You were determined not to let those thoughts and memories come back- you had been working so hard for so long to get rid of them.</p><p>At some point, you must of dozed off because you woke with a start and a panicked breath. </p><p>\u201cWoah, you okay doll?\u201d Bucky asked from the other side of the room and you passed by him to get to the bathroom.</p><p>You slid down the wall and into a ball, shutting your eyes and rocking slightly.</p><p>\u201cStop-\u201d You whispered to yourself, \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d You tried to stay calm but you could feel the tears coming on, afraid that Bucky would hear you outside of the room.</p><p>He lightly tapped the door after another minute and you shouted, your voice cracking, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoll-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep a lookout.\u201d You said back in a harsh tone, lowering your head into your hands.</p><p>Another moment later there was a splintering sound and your head snapped back up, seeing Bucky at the door- he had broken the area around the lock.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand what \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 is?\u201d You asked, an unfortunate tear running down your cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand I know what a fake \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 is?\u201d He asked back, stepping towards you.</p><p>Your breath caught, \u201cPlease, leave.\u201d You asked, more desperation than anything in your voice.</p><p>He stopped moving towards you and knelt down so you two were eye level. His brows were furrowed and his expression worried. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You growled back to him, your face returning back to its position in your hands as you focused on breathing, the impending panic attack coming in. \u201cLeave.\u201d You said again, this time much weaker as the start of it came on. </p><p>Your mind lost its focus, a million thoughts crashing in on you at once as you remembered things you wanted forgotten with every fiber of your being. Your breath shortened and you flung your legs out to try and let your lungs get more air. </p><p>\u201cDoll-\u201d Your eyes snapped to him, waiting to see him mocking you, \u201cBreathe in-\u201d He waited and you did so, \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d He stated and then he motioned for you to breathe out. He asked you over and over to do this and after five minutes or so your breathing returned closer to normal, the panic lowering a bit.</p><p>You waited and sniffled a little, \u201cHow did you know that would work?\u201d </p><p>He met your eyes, \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one with panic attacks.\u201d</p><p>You paused, letting that sink in. \u201cOne of Earth\u2019s mightiest Avengers has troubles too?\u201d</p><p>He snorted but his face went back to worry, \u201cWhatever it is you\u2019re going through, you shouldn\u2019t be alone through it.\u201d He scooted closer, and he was only an arms length away. \u201cYou never have to tell me what it is that\u2019s causing it but let me help you.\u201d He asked, his face sill soft, unmocking.</p><p>\u201cWhy make my problems yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to.\u201d He responded without skipping a beat, his hand reaching out towards you and you flinched away. He immediately retracted his hand, trying to coax you into a safe feeling.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Once returning from the mission, Bucky didn\u2019t mention what happened in front of anyone. He did, however, turn to you and ask you to promise something in front of your building.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You turned around, facing the door.</p><p>\u201cThat if you need me for any reason, you\u2019ll call me. Even when you don\u2019t want to- especially then.\u201d He spoke softly again. </p><p>You paused, thinking about just walking into the building without answering him. He probably sensed this and grabbed your wrist with a little squeeze.</p><p>Your eyes shut, another memory popping into your head from before. \u201cFine.\u201d You whispered, shaking loose from his grasp before walking inside- not looking back.</p><p>You rubbed your face after locking your door and throwing your bag onto the couch. </p><p>You should be over this, why were you reverting? You went into the kitchen and grabbed a beer out of the fridge before sitting on the couch, lost in thought.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, come here now.\u201d He had spoken and you instantly did as he asked. He smiled as his arm wrapped around you. \u201cBe a good girl and grab me a drink.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You nodded, leaping up from your spot towards the kitchen. Opening the door you noticed there were no more left and a cold chill ran over you. You grabbed your keys from the table and walked back into the front room. \u201cI have to run to the store-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d He asked, his attention snapping back towards you. You shrank back a little and tried to repeat yourself. He stood, \u201cYou telling me you didn\u2019t even have the decency to think about me? To get me something to help me unwind after a long day?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You shook your head and he spoke again.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNow I have to wait for you?\u201d He raised his voice and then lowered it again, which made it worse, \u201cYou are an ungrateful piece of shit. I\u2019ve taken you in and looked after you-\u201d</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Your eyes snapped open, trying to push the thoughts back again.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d You spoke, standing and walking towards the fridge for another drink.</p><p>Hours later, the flashbacks still poured in at random no matter how hard you tried to drink them away.</p><p>You sighed, unwillingly pulling your phone out of your pocket and your thumb hovering over Bucky\u2019s number. You slammed your fist on the table and went to the fridge for another drink, the last thing you want to do is have someone else here. Especially now.</p><p>You groaned and downed your drink, clicking the call button before you could think about it and raised it towards your ear while getting up for yet another drink.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He answered on the third ring.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d You spoke into the phone, closing the fridge.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d He spoke again, softly.</p><p>You sighed a little into the phone, cracking open your drink and taking a sip, pausing. \u201cLook-\u201d You spoke finally, after a minute of silence, \u201cI told you I\u2019d call if I was\u2026 anyways. I did.\u201d You waited for a moment and then you heard him breathe, \u201cThis was a stupid idea, I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d You closed your eyes and hung up the phone, throwing it over onto your recliner on the other side of the room.</p><p>Another drink later, there was a knock on your door. You groaned and waited for them to leave or figure out they were at the wrong door but it came again- you stood up and angrily threw open your door with a, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Your eyes met those of Bucky who didn\u2019t wait at all, just stepped inside, shut your door and pulled you into a hug. You paused, wanting to back away or joke but instead you burst into tears.</p><p>He held you for a long time like that, eventually moving over to the couch and stroking your hair, staying with you overnight.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>He had done this a half a dozen times over the last month and you had finally told him, bit by bit, why you were like this. You told him how long ago it had happened, how long it had lasted and what were the kinds of things that you were used to from it.</p><p>Instead of insisting you shouldn\u2019t have stayed or judged you or told you to calm down about it, he calmly listened, nodded his head and stroked your hair until you calmed down and fell asleep.</p><p>Eventually, he talked you into moving into the Avengers building with everyone, away from the shitty area of town you thought you deserved. He stayed with you most nights and became a person you needed to see and share things with.</p><p>He was one of the people that helped you get over your darkest thoughts, year by year- and someone who had never let you down.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meLZRtVe8rmhaXM2aukkAAA\">@breezy1415</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifliB2VbbTHy46JgVMtAVg\">@seninjakitey</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR7vawQ6YMOsodFXfGIscZA\">@imboredsueme</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt7xkc5FQdNINJqWAlqJueA\">@courtneychicken</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn3q9PEwjSwN81-YCZhnJvw\">@marriedtopeterparker</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe0guEbIbfr_-P7ENrxHew\">@imeannooffensebabybut</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJBejz9XBUZV8e2WpcAXm2w\">@marie-lestowell</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkdbkiG7Q7D8zN63s3jSOSw\">@cassiopeia-barrow</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf9swDA7BSfYTxpnb2k5jA\">@daphne-fandom-writing</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF8Fm18x8czeo9m4Gv1VZhw\">@notmyfault404</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWtJq_jmUKmrE9NOrOMQrEA\">@i-larb-spooderman</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/merzeuODLns1vGdaxyY0UgQ\">@aussiearies</a></p>",

It had been a little tough since you had to travel back and forth often but it was your wish. You hadn\u2019t lived with someone since\u2026 no. </p><p>You shook your head, trying to clear it before entering the conference room you were supposed to meet everyone in.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d A soft voice came from behind and you jumped a little.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Buck.\u201d You nudged his arm, \u201cHow long you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and nudged you back, \u201cLong enough.\u201d He smiled as his eyes met yours.</p><p>You turned back towards the door and cleared your throat, \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2014</p><p>They were picking a couple of people to go on a reconnaissance mission and it was your turn to go next- and to be honest you were worried about it. You hadn\u2019t had to be on an overnight mission before and given how much sleep you had been getting lately, you weren\u2019t sure about how well you were going to do.</p><p>You walked out of your place and locked the door behind you, rolling your eyes when you saw a guy in the hall passed out again and stepped over him towards the front door. You opened it and saw Bucky standing there. He was staring at you with a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>He sighed and shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that you live here.\u201d</p><p>You sighed back, looking around, \u201cWhere\u2019s our ride?\u201d</p><p>He nodded towards the bike in front of you and you snorted, \u201cYou scared to hold on, doll?\u201d He smirked as he threw you a helmet.</p><p>You laughed and shook your head, \u201cI\u2019m not, are you?\u201d You took the keys off his belt loop and threw your leg over the bike, looking back.</p><p>He laughed, putting his helmet on and throwing his leg over- scooting behind you rather closely, holding onto your sides.</p><p>You rode off and quickly moved towards the quinjet, a little too aware of the placement of his hands. Getting there, you waited for him to move and it took him a minute.</p><p>\u201cCome on, gramps, I wanna get there today.\u201d You mocked with a small smirk and felt him rumble from behind you.</p><p>It was a few hours off and the ride turned out to have a lot of nagging and teasing which took your mind off of darker thoughts that seemed to be edging in today, as much as you wished they wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Arriving at the hotel, you both went in and got situated in the room- the one you would be looking out of. </p><p>No one had told you it only had one bed in it, or that the bed was going to be ten feet away from the lookout spot where you were supposed to be gaining intel from.</p><p>You sighed as you threw your bag down and raided the mini fridge, grabbing an expensive can of beer and sitting down in a chair to look through the room service menu.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d You asked without peering up over the menu.</p><p>\u201cSure- just get two of whatever you\u2019re getting. That includes that drink of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right up.\u201d You winked over to him before turning towards the phone and placing an order. You walked over towards the mini fridge again and grabbed another can and set it down in front of Bucky, helping him with the equipment.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s going to be on first watch?\u201d Bucky asked, opening his can after you were done setting up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on both watches.\u201d You mumbled, raising the can to your lips again.</p><p>He chuckled before realizing you were serious, \u201cOh come on, doll. You have to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>You sighed and thanked room service for their impeccable timing, not wanting to start an argument. You stood and strode over to the door, opening it and bringing the cart inside yourself and nodding a thanks before bolting the door shut again.</p><p>Looking under the lids, you laughed. \u201cI think I went a little overboard with the quantity.\u201d</p><p>Bucky stood and rubbed his hands together, \u201cGood, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>You went back to joking and eating and drinking while keeping a lookout and soon it got late.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take first watch, okay?\u201d Bucky stated, nodding towards the bed. \u201cAt least try for a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>You sighed, going to the bathroom to get ready for bed. You came out and laid down, staring at the end table for a while. You were determined not to let those thoughts and memories come back- you had been working so hard for so long to get rid of them.</p><p>At some point, you must of dozed off because you woke with a start and a panicked breath. </p><p>\u201cWoah, you okay doll?\u201d Bucky asked from the other side of the room and you passed by him to get to the bathroom.</p><p>You slid down the wall and into a ball, shutting your eyes and rocking slightly.</p><p>\u201cStop-\u201d You whispered to yourself, \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d You tried to stay calm but you could feel the tears coming on, afraid that Bucky would hear you outside of the room.</p><p>He lightly tapped the door after another minute and you shouted, your voice cracking, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoll-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep a lookout.\u201d You said back in a harsh tone, lowering your head into your hands.</p><p>Another moment later there was a splintering sound and your head snapped back up, seeing Bucky at the door- he had broken the area around the lock.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand what \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 is?\u201d You asked, an unfortunate tear running down your cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand I know what a fake \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 is?\u201d He asked back, stepping towards you.</p><p>Your breath caught, \u201cPlease, leave.\u201d You asked, more desperation than anything in your voice.</p><p>He stopped moving towards you and knelt down so you two were eye level. His brows were furrowed and his expression worried. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You growled back to him, your face returning back to its position in your hands as you focused on breathing, the impending panic attack coming in. \u201cLeave.\u201d You said again, this time much weaker as the start of it came on. </p><p>Your mind lost its focus, a million thoughts crashing in on you at once as you remembered things you wanted forgotten with every fiber of your being. Your breath shortened and you flung your legs out to try and let your lungs get more air. </p><p>\u201cDoll-\u201d Your eyes snapped to him, waiting to see him mocking you, \u201cBreathe in-\u201d He waited and you did so, \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d He stated and then he motioned for you to breathe out. He asked you over and over to do this and after five minutes or so your breathing returned closer to normal, the panic lowering a bit.</p><p>You waited and sniffled a little, \u201cHow did you know that would work?\u201d </p><p>He met your eyes, \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one with panic attacks.\u201d</p><p>You paused, letting that sink in. \u201cOne of Earth\u2019s mightiest Avengers has troubles too?\u201d</p><p>He snorted but his face went back to worry, \u201cWhatever it is you\u2019re going through, you shouldn\u2019t be alone through it.\u201d He scooted closer, and he was only an arms length away. \u201cYou never have to tell me what it is that\u2019s causing it but let me help you.\u201d He asked, his face sill soft, unmocking.</p><p>\u201cWhy make my problems yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to.\u201d He responded without skipping a beat, his hand reaching out towards you and you flinched away. He immediately retracted his hand, trying to coax you into a safe feeling.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Once returning from the mission, Bucky didn\u2019t mention what happened in front of anyone. He did, however, turn to you and ask you to promise something in front of your building.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You turned around, facing the door.</p><p>\u201cThat if you need me for any reason, you\u2019ll call me. Even when you don\u2019t want to- especially then.\u201d He spoke softly again. </p><p>You paused, thinking about just walking into the building without answering him. He probably sensed this and grabbed your wrist with a little squeeze.</p><p>Your eyes shut, another memory popping into your head from before. \u201cFine.\u201d You whispered, shaking loose from his grasp before walking inside- not looking back.</p><p>You rubbed your face after locking your door and throwing your bag onto the couch. </p><p>You should be over this, why were you reverting? You went into the kitchen and grabbed a beer out of the fridge before sitting on the couch, lost in thought.</p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, come here now.\u201d He had spoken and you instantly did as he asked. He smiled as his arm wrapped around you. \u201cBe a good girl and grab me a drink.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You nodded, leaping up from your spot towards the kitchen.

You hadn&rsquo;t lived with someone since&hellip; no. </p><p>You shook your head, trying to clear it before entering the conference room you were supposed to meet everyone in.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; A soft voice came from behind and you jumped a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Buck.&rdquo; You nudged his arm, &ldquo;How long you been standing there?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged and nudged you back, &ldquo;Long enough.&rdquo; He smiled as his eyes met yours.</p><p>You turned back towards the door and cleared your throat, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>They were picking a couple of people to go on a reconnaissance mission and it was your turn to go next- and to be honest you were worried about it. You hadn&rsquo;t had to be on an overnight mission before and given how much sleep you had been getting lately, you weren&rsquo;t sure about how well you were going to do.</p><p>You walked out of your place and locked the door behind you, rolling your eyes when you saw a guy in the hall passed out again and stepped over him towards the front door. You opened it and saw Bucky standing there. He was staring at you with a frown.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>He sighed and shook his head, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible that you live here.&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed back, looking around, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s our ride?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded towards the bike in front of you and you snorted, &ldquo;You scared to hold on, doll?&rdquo; He smirked as he threw you a helmet.</p><p>You laughed and shook your head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, are you?&rdquo; You took the keys off his belt loop and threw your leg over the bike, looking back.</p><p>He laughed, putting his helmet on and throwing his leg over- scooting behind you rather closely, holding onto your sides.</p><p>You rode off and quickly moved towards the quinjet, a little too aware of the placement of his hands. Getting there, you waited for him to move and it took him a minute.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, gramps, I wanna get there today.&rdquo; You mocked with a small smirk and felt him rumble from behind you.</p><p>It was a few hours off and the ride turned out to have a lot of nagging and teasing which took your mind off of darker thoughts that seemed to be edging in today, as much as you wished they wouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Arriving at the hotel, you both went in and got situated in the room- the one you would be looking out of. </p><p>No one had told you it only had one bed in it, or that the bed was going to be ten feet away from the lookout spot where you were supposed to be gaining intel from.</p><p>You sighed as you threw your bag down and raided the mini fridge, grabbing an expensive can of beer and sitting down in a chair to look through the room service menu.</p><p>&ldquo;You want something to eat?&rdquo; You asked without peering up over the menu.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure- just get two of whatever you&rsquo;re getting. That includes that drink of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Coming right up.&rdquo; You winked over to him before turning towards the phone and placing an order. You walked over towards the mini fridge again and grabbed another can and set it down in front of Bucky, helping him with the equipment.</p><p>&ldquo;So who&rsquo;s going to be on first watch?&rdquo; Bucky asked, opening his can after you were done setting up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on both watches.&rdquo; You mumbled, raising the can to your lips again.</p><p>He chuckled before realizing you were serious, &ldquo;Oh come on, doll. You have to get some sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed and thanked room service for their impeccable timing, not wanting to start an argument. You stood and strode over to the door, opening it and bringing the cart inside yourself and nodding a thanks before bolting the door shut again.</p><p>Looking under the lids, you laughed. &ldquo;I think I went a little overboard with the quantity.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky stood and rubbed his hands together, &ldquo;Good, I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p><p>You went back to joking and eating and drinking while keeping a lookout and soon it got late.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take first watch, okay?&rdquo; Bucky stated, nodding towards the bed. &ldquo;At least try for a couple hours.&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed, going to the bathroom to get ready for bed. You came out and laid down, staring at the end table for a while. You were determined not to let those thoughts and memories come back- you had been working so hard for so long to get rid of them.</p><p>At some point, you must of dozed off because you woke with a start and a panicked breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Woah, you okay doll?&rdquo; Bucky asked from the other side of the room and you passed by him to get to the bathroom.</p><p>You slid down the wall and into a ball, shutting your eyes and rocking slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop-&rdquo; You whispered to yourself, &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t hurt you anymore.&rdquo; You tried to stay calm but you could feel the tears coming on, afraid that Bucky would hear you outside of the room.</p><p>He lightly tapped the door after another minute and you shouted, your voice cracking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doll-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Keep a lookout.&rdquo; You said back in a harsh tone, lowering your head into your hands.</p><p>Another moment later there was a splintering sound and your head snapped back up, seeing Bucky at the door- he had broken the area around the lock.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand what &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rsquo; is?&rdquo; You asked, an unfortunate tear running down your cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand I know what a fake &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rsquo; is?&rdquo; He asked back, stepping towards you.</p><p>Your breath caught, &ldquo;Please, leave.&rdquo; You asked, more desperation than anything in your voice.</p><p>He stopped moving towards you and knelt down so you two were eye level. His brows were furrowed and his expression worried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; You growled back to him, your face returning back to its position in your hands as you focused on breathing, the impending panic attack coming in. &ldquo;Leave.&rdquo; You said again, this time much weaker as the start of it came on. </p><p>Your mind lost its focus, a million thoughts crashing in on you at once as you remembered things you wanted forgotten with every fiber of your being. Your breath shortened and you flung your legs out to try and let your lungs get more air. </p><p>&ldquo;Doll-&rdquo; Your eyes snapped to him, waiting to see him mocking you, &ldquo;Breathe in-&rdquo; He waited and you did so, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay,&rdquo; He stated and then he motioned for you to breathe out. He asked you over and over to do this and after five minutes or so your breathing returned closer to normal, the panic lowering a bit.</p><p>You waited and sniffled a little, &ldquo;How did you know that would work?&rdquo; </p><p>He met your eyes, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t the only one with panic attacks.&rdquo;</p><p>You paused, letting that sink in. &ldquo;One of Earth&rsquo;s mightiest Avengers has troubles too?&rdquo;</p><p>He snorted but his face went back to worry, &ldquo;Whatever it is you&rsquo;re going through, you shouldn&rsquo;t be alone through it.&rdquo; He scooted closer, and he was only an arms length away. &ldquo;You never have to tell me what it is that&rsquo;s causing it but let me help you.&rdquo; He asked, his face sill soft, unmocking.</p><p>&ldquo;Why make my problems yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you to.&rdquo; He responded without skipping a beat, his hand reaching out towards you and you flinched away. He immediately retracted his hand, trying to coax you into a safe feeling.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Once returning from the mission, Bucky didn&rsquo;t mention what happened in front of anyone. He did, however, turn to you and ask you to promise something in front of your building.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You turned around, facing the door.</p><p>&ldquo;That if you need me for any reason, you&rsquo;ll call me. Even when you don&rsquo;t want to- especially then.&rdquo; He spoke softly again. </p><p>You paused, thinking about just walking into the building without answering him. He probably sensed this and grabbed your wrist with a little squeeze.</p><p>Your eyes shut, another memory popping into your head from before. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; You whispered, shaking loose from his grasp before walking inside- not looking back.</p><p>You rubbed your face after locking your door and throwing your bag onto the couch. </p><p>You should be over this, why were you reverting? You went into the kitchen and grabbed a beer out of the fridge before sitting on the couch, lost in thought.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, come here now.&rdquo; He had spoken and you instantly did as he asked. He smiled as his arm wrapped around you. &ldquo;Be a good girl and grab me a drink.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You nodded, leaping up from your spot towards the kitchen. Opening the door you noticed there were no more left and a cold chill ran over you. You grabbed your keys from the table and walked back into the front room. &ldquo;I have to run to the store-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He asked, his attention snapping back towards you. You shrank back a little and tried to repeat yourself. He stood, &ldquo;You telling me you didn&rsquo;t even have the decency to think about me? To get me something to help me unwind after a long day?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You shook your head and he spoke again.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Now I have to wait for you?&rdquo; He raised his voice and then lowered it again, which made it worse, &ldquo;You are an ungrateful piece of shit. I&rsquo;ve taken you in and looked after you-&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Your eyes snapped open, trying to push the thoughts back again.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off.&rdquo; You spoke, standing and walking towards the fridge for another drink.</p><p>Hours later, the flashbacks still poured in at random no matter how hard you tried to drink them away.</p><p>You sighed, unwillingly pulling your phone out of your pocket and your thumb hovering over Bucky&rsquo;s number. You slammed your fist on the table and went to the fridge for another drink, the last thing you want to do is have someone else here. Especially now.</p><p>You groaned and downed your drink, clicking the call button before you could think about it and raised it towards your ear while getting up for yet another drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; He answered on the third ring.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; You spoke into the phone, closing the fridge.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; He spoke again, softly.</p><p>You sighed a little into the phone, cracking open your drink and taking a sip, pausing. &ldquo;Look-&rdquo; You spoke finally, after a minute of silence, &ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d call if I was&hellip; anyways. I did.&rdquo; You waited for a moment and then you heard him breathe, &ldquo;This was a stupid idea, I&rsquo;ll talk to you later.&rdquo; You closed your eyes and hung up the phone, throwing it over onto your recliner on the other side of the room.</p><p>Another drink later, there was a knock on your door. You groaned and waited for them to leave or figure out they were at the wrong door but it came again- you stood up and angrily threw open your door with a, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes met those of Bucky who didn&rsquo;t wait at all, just stepped inside, shut your door and pulled you into a hug. You paused, wanting to back away or joke but instead you burst into tears.</p><p>He held you for a long time like that, eventually moving over to the couch and stroking your hair, staying with you overnight.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>He had done this a half a dozen times over the last month and you had finally told him, bit by bit, why you were like this. You told him how long ago it had happened, how long it had lasted and what were the kinds of things that you were used to from it.</p><p>Instead of insisting you shouldn&rsquo;t have stayed or judged you or told you to calm down about it, he calmly listened, nodded his head and stroked your hair until you calmed down and fell asleep.</p><p>Eventually, he talked you into moving into the Avengers building with everyone, away from the shitty area of town you thought you deserved. He stayed with you most nights and became a person you needed to see and share things with.</p><p>He was one of the people that helped you get over your darkest thoughts, year by year- and someone who had never let you down.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meLZRtVe8rmhaXM2aukkAAA\">@breezy1415</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifliB2VbbTHy46JgVMtAVg\">@seninjakitey</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR7vawQ6YMOsodFXfGIscZA\">@imboredsueme</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt7xkc5FQdNINJqWAlqJueA\">@courtneychicken</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn3q9PEwjSwN81-YCZhnJvw\">@marriedtopeterparker</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe0guEbIbfr_-P7ENrxHew\">@imeannooffensebabybut</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJBejz9XBUZV8e2WpcAXm2w\">@marie-lestowell</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkdbkiG7Q7D8zN63s3jSOSw\">@cassiopeia-barrow</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf9swDA7BSfYTxpnb2k5jA\">@daphne-fandom-writing</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF8Fm18x8czeo9m4Gv1VZhw\">@notmyfault404</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWtJq_jmUKmrE9NOrOMQrEA\">@i-larb-spooderman</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/merzeuODLns1vGdaxyY0UgQ\">@aussiearies</a></p>",
