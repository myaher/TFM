He was humble, courageous, wildly\nintelligent, and quietly romantic in ways in which made your heart beat just\nso. Except, there was a tiny part in your brain which loved hot showers more\nthan the man who became the Hulk. </p><p>Especially, because you were\nnigh freezing, and he had been in the bathroom for the last hour. </p><p>It was summer back home, but\nyou were not at home, but an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility in Australia after\na mission fighting a very confused child. Her abilities were causing\ndestruction to the area around her, and, if the team hadn\u2019t stepped in, to\nherself. It hadn\u2019t been easy \u2013 she kept falling through the ground and disappearing\nin strange ways whenever she would be afraid, and when you had finally got through\nto the poor darling, S.H.I.E.L.D. intervened.</p><p> You kept yourself quiet when she had been\ncuffed, trying to reassure her she wasn\u2019t bad. But, she was a seven-year-old girl\nwho had been poisoned by an epidemic releasing a sort of crystal into the world\u2019s\nwater, and she didn\u2019t know what was happening to her, or would happen to her.</p><p>You just wished that Tony\nStark had had the common decency to call that magic guy he always left on\nvoicemail. The struggle to contain the girl would have ended five minutes\nbefore it began \u2013 no fuss, no stress. But Tony Stark had a habit of relying on what\nhe had on hand, whenever he could, and yet, an archer, a spy, a Hulk, a super soldier,\nand <i>the</i> Iron Man was no match for the\ngirl who woke up one day and realised her body could go wherever it wanted.</p><p>You were still getting used\nto the fact that you, an ex-air force pilot, had gained the ability of something\ncalled \u2018psychokinesis\u2019, even if it has been over two years. You were called up\nby Ms Hill forty-eight hours after you accidently broke the entire china cabinet\nin a Goodwill store, and after that, you were soon an Avenger. </p><p>The lady at Goodwill called\nyou a menace as you paid her the fifty-five dollars to cover the damage.

He was humble, courageous, wildly\nintelligent, and quietly romantic in ways in which made your heart beat just\nso. Except, there was a tiny part in your brain which loved hot showers more\nthan the man who became the Hulk. </p><p>Especially, because you were\nnigh freezing, and he had been in the bathroom for the last hour. </p><p>It was summer back home, but\nyou were not at home, but an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility in Australia after\na mission fighting a very confused child. Her abilities were causing\ndestruction to the area around her, and, if the team hadn&rsquo;t stepped in, to\nherself. It hadn&rsquo;t been easy &ndash; she kept falling through the ground and disappearing\nin strange ways whenever she would be afraid, and when you had finally got through\nto the poor darling, S.H.I.E.L.D. intervened.</p><p> You kept yourself quiet when she had been\ncuffed, trying to reassure her she wasn&rsquo;t bad. But, she was a seven-year-old girl\nwho had been poisoned by an epidemic releasing a sort of crystal into the world&rsquo;s\nwater, and she didn&rsquo;t know what was happening to her, or would happen to her.</p><p>You just wished that Tony\nStark had had the common decency to call that magic guy he always left on\nvoicemail. The struggle to contain the girl would have ended five minutes\nbefore it began &ndash; no fuss, no stress. But Tony Stark had a habit of relying on what\nhe had on hand, whenever he could, and yet, an archer, a spy, a Hulk, a super soldier,\nand <i>the</i> Iron Man was no match for the\ngirl who woke up one day and realised her body could go wherever it wanted.</p><p>You were still getting used\nto the fact that you, an ex-air force pilot, had gained the ability of something\ncalled &lsquo;psychokinesis&rsquo;, even if it has been over two years. You were called up\nby Ms Hill forty-eight hours after you accidently broke the entire china cabinet\nin a Goodwill store, and after that, you were soon an Avenger. </p><p>The lady at Goodwill called\nyou a menace as you paid her the fifty-five dollars to cover the damage. The\npeople of New York called you a hero. </p><p>You called yourself <i>cold</i>. </p><p>Dropping the standard\nblanket that came with every room to the bed, you rush to the bathroom, and\nwhen the doorhandle under your hand unlocks, you barged in. </p><p>&ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo; Bruce shouted, from\nthe shower. </p><p>He&rsquo;d been in so long, that the\nmirror and the glass panels were fogged up that you couldn&rsquo;t see much of him.\nBut, in here, it was so much warmer, and you clambered to the toilet, and sat\nupon the lid.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; He\nasked, this time with less panic in his voice. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I was\nshowering?&rdquo; </p><p>You harrumph with a shiver, &ldquo;Yeah,\nlike an hour ago!&rdquo; you protest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>cold</i>.&rdquo;\n</p><p>He shuts the water off. &ldquo;Has\nit really been that long?&rdquo; He says and grabs the towel that&rsquo;s slung over the\ntop of the shower wall. You&rsquo;ve only been dating Bruce for three years, and yes,\nit&rsquo;s been a mixture of highs and lows, but he still shows modesty with his body\nafter all this time. It&rsquo;s cute. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>When you look up, he&rsquo;s\npadding toward you on the tile floor, wrist outstretched. You lean your forehead\nonto his skin and smile when he feels your temperature. But he looks nothing\nmore than horrified &ndash; and even though you&rsquo;re sitting on the commode like it&rsquo;s a\nchair and he&rsquo;s in a beige bath towel, he gathers you into his arms, and holds\nyou close.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; you ask your\nboyfriend after a while.</p><p>He sighs. &ldquo;She was afraid of\nme.&rdquo; </p><p>You know what he means. The\nmission. It had been fine until one of Clint&rsquo;s trick arrows had gone off near\nher, and then she was harder to catch than moonlight in a man&rsquo;s fingers. That\nwas when it was decidedly time for the Hulk to make an appearance; more as a\ntactic to round her up. But perhaps, it made it even worse. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help what other\npeople feel,&rdquo; you whisper, pulling Bruce closer. &ldquo;and, she&rsquo;s a kid, too. And,\nAustralian. They never have superhero shenanigans down under, and you&rsquo;re <i>the Hulk</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>He laughs a little at that. &ldquo;I\nknow a few superheroes from here, Gateway, Slipstream&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You shake your head and stand\nup from the toilet seat lid. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s beside the point, Bruce.&rdquo; You whisper,\nlooking into his eyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a kid. That Spiderling hero from Queens was\nafraid of you too, remember? Now you work together on science-y things all the\ntime!&rdquo; You place your forehead upon his, and add, softly, &ldquo;One day, when that\ngirl grows up, or into her abilities, she&rsquo;ll recognise you for what you did\ntoday, and not for what the Other Guy is known for.&rdquo; </p><p>He lets out a breath,\nperhaps of relief. &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; </p><p>You quirk a brow. &ldquo;Bruce, I&rsquo;m\nan ex-pilot, your girlfriend, someone who can move things without touching\nthem, and very cold.&rdquo; You say in a different tone, a heavy layer of sarcasm, &ldquo;No,\nI don&rsquo;t mean it, I&rsquo;m just saying what I can to get in the damn shower.&rdquo; </p><p>Bruce can&rsquo;t help but chuckle\nas he takes your spot on the toilet lid. He watches as you use your abilities\nto undress as quick as you can and turn the shower on warm enough to soothe\nyour icy problems. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; you practically moan,\nturning the hot tap on more. &ldquo;<i>Bliss</i>.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, _________,&rdquo; he laughs,\nshaking his head. The water in his curls flies everywhere, and you can&rsquo;t help\nbut laugh along him. He gathers his towel that&rsquo;s around him, and walking from\nthe bathroom, you hear Bruce call out to you, &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too!&rdquo; you reply.\n&ldquo;and, hot showers!&rdquo; </p>",
