        "answer": "<blockquote><p>Why thank you! I feel as though this one got a bit out of hand, but I made it to the smooches eventually, and I <i>think </i>it all works out.</p><p>The rest of the series, can be found together as <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17541179/chapters/41332937\">Make A Life Worth Living</a> on AO3</p></blockquote><p>Every Thursday morning, before the sun was up, Brother Francis would step out into the Dowling\u2019s garden, nod as though he\u2019d done something, and leave a note to remind the rest of the staff that it was his day off. For some reason, no one could ever remember his schedule. He would leave through the front gate and walk quietly down the road to the bus stop, a mile or so away. It was time to think, he said, on the rare occasion when someone offered him a lift. He just wanted to walk through the sunrise and think.</p><p>About an hour later, every Thursday, Nanny Ashtoreth would wake inside the house, check on sleeping Warlock, and hiss quiet advice to Ms. Dowling as to how the child had been getting on. Then she would pick up her umbrella and carpetbag and walk out the front gate and down the road away from town, in the opposite direction of the bus stop. She was an ominous blot on the vaguely pastoral, somewhat developed area, and her shoes clacked loudly whether she was walking on concrete, or a dirt road, or on the grass. In the year and a half she\u2019d been with the family, no one had managed to find out where she went. No one had felt inclined to try very hard.\u00a0</p><p>By this time, Brother Francis would be standing beside the bus stop, waving away each of the two busses that came by at this time on a Thursday. He entertained himself by doing small acts of kindness for the driver and the passengers, because that was the sort of person he was, and small acts of malice, because Nanny Ashtoreth rarely encountered anyone on such mornings and it was good to keep things balanced.</p><p>About half an hour after Nanny Ashtoreth had left the Dowling\u2019s house, an old black Bentley drove past the front drive. It shone like new despite having spent the past week hidden in a conveniently large shrub, and no one knew who it belonged to. Not that they\u2019d tried very hard to find out.</p><p>Ten minutes after that, the Bentley pulled up to the bus stop, the passenger door cracked open, and Crowley said \u201cget in, Angel,\u201d as Aziraphale said \u201cgood morning, Dear.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>This particular Thursday happened to be in early of August, and it was already uncomfortably warm. Aziraphale wiped a bead of sweat off his neck. He preferred to sweat, on principle, though if the summer kept on the way it had been going he would be sorely tempted to change his mind. Crowley did not sweat, and Aziraphale was unsure if that was because she chose not to, or it hadn\u2019t occurred to her, or perhaps, being a serpent, she was physically unable to. He didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast?\u201d Crowley asked, as always. As always, the answer was yes, and Crowley adjusted course for an outdoor caf\u00e9 that served marvelous scones.</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything, you know, <i>occult</i> about the boy?\u201d Aziraphale asked, thinking it better to get the worst out of the way first. As always, the answer was no.</p><p>For all its features, the one thing the Bentley didn\u2019t have was a strong air conditioning system. Aziraphale rolled down the window partway, but had to roll it up again when Crowley picked up speed. He miracled the air around him a few degrees cooler and turned slightly to watch Crowley as she drove. Everything about her was sort of desperately severe, from the tight bun of her hair to the furrow in her forehead to the purse of her mouth and the tight stillness of her hands on the steering wheel. He thought about putting one of his hands over hers, for comfort or to reassure himself of\u2026 something, but wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d allow it. She\u2019d been particularly aloof recently.</p><p>Accounts of Warlock\u2019s weekly developments carried them the rest of the way to the caf\u00e9 and halfway through breakfast, with both beings trying to focus so that they might spend the afternoon and evening really enjoying themselves.\u00a0</p><p>Then, \u201cwe\u2019re going to the zoo on Tuesday,\u201d Crowley said, pushing things forward a bit. She sipped her tea primly. The cup gave a sharp clink when she set it back in its saucer. \u201cYou ought to meet us there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Aziraphale ate a scone. \u201cWhy the zoo?\u201d he asked, though he was distracted by the subtle way Crowley rolled her shoulders and winced.\u00a0</p><p>For millennia, Crowley\u2019s spine had naturally assumed a snakey, almost boneless quality that, when she was relaxed, manifested in all manner of slouching, slinking, and draping herself over furniture. Now, Crowley normally held it to nearly human standards until it was time to get comfortable, but Nanny Ashtoreth was perpetually rigid as though she\u2019d been built around a ruler. It looked\u2026 uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the sort of thing one does with children,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cMr. Dowling is hosting a luncheon for some very important people, and it has been <i>suggested</i> that Warlock and I make ourselves scarce.\u201d The lift of her eyebrows indicated that it was a bit more than a suggestion, and also that she found the whole thing rather ridiculous. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s worried about. He hardly sees either of us as it is, and children make excellent conversation pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d said Aziraphale. He ate another scone and decided now was not the time to address Crowley\u2019s issues with the Dowlings\u2019 parenting strategy. He was not particularly partial to zoos, but it <i>would </i>be nice to get out for the day, and having the particulars of his work schedule slip people\u2019s minds was very easy indeed. \u201cShall I meet you at the bus stop, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cYou\u2019d better meet us there. By the giraffes, perhaps? They\u2019d be a bad example for the boy. They\u2019re selfish and malicious, you can see it in their eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly true, Dear. They\u2019re kind and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ineffable,\u201d </i>Aziraphale said, holding back his smile until Crowley scoffed. \u201cBut what do you mean I ought to meet you there? We\u2019re coming from the same place, aren\u2019t we? The Dowlings won\u2019t be any the wiser, and it\u2019s not as though Warlock will mind. He\u2019s quite fond of me you know.\u201d</p><p>Meeting at the bus stop on their days off had been Crowley\u2019s idea, because she didn\u2019t fancy the Dowlings thinking that Nanny Ashtoreth and Brother Francis were working together, or being <i>intimate </i>together, or even knew each other beyond the limits of their jobs. Aziraphale had agreed because it was more practical to play it safe than to alter the family\u2019s memories if they got upset, and because it reminded him, in a way, of the care they\u2019d taken in the days when the Arrangement was young and seemed far riskier than it had turned out to be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about what he <i>minds,</i>\u201d Crowley said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what he <i>thinks. </i>And Ms. Ashtoreth is <i>not</i> the sort of woman who picks up male company in secret. She might accept chance companionship during an outing, though, which is why you\u2019ve got to meet us there and pretend you knew nothing about it.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale mulled over this as he finished his tea. \u201cBut surely,\u201d he said. \u201cWarlock won\u2019t know the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAnd at any rate, <i>I will</i>. Ms. Ashtoreth is not a reckless woman. Nor is she a friendly one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale agreed.</p><p>\u201cShe carries the secret sadness of family estrangement and heartbreak, which have made her bitter,\u201d Crowley explained, sounding more and more like Ms. Ashtoreth with every word. \u201cShe trusts only herself to protect and corrupt the child in her care. It doesn\u2019t matter if she thinks Francis is resoundingly homosexual, she doesn\u2019t trust him enough to scoop him off the side of the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, it\u2019s really just you and me,\u201d Aziraphale said weakly, wondering when that had stopped being true.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just <i>you</i>,\u201d Crowley corrected, her voice sharp, brittle, and suddenly her own again. \u201cYou always manage to just be yourself, but with roses instead of books and disappearing around the side of the house instead of closing your shop, and they <i>believe</i> you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not <i>entirely </i>accurate,\u201d Aziraphale protested, this being easier to address then the vague unease Crowley\u2019s plan had sparked in him. \u201cI\u2019ve spent rather a lot of effort on the details of appearing human, the hobbies and the sweat and so forth. I just don\u2019t bother to completely change my character every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, that wouldn\u2019t <i>work </i>for me,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too late to change it now, anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They finished their breakfast in silence. Crowley was very stiff and controlled, and Aziraphale felt as though she were very far away. Without warning, she stood and placed a neatly folded stack of money on the table to pay their bill. Aziraphale tucked the last scone in his pocket then followed her to the car.\u00a0</p><p>Before she opened the door, Aziraphale finally chanced it and put a hand on her shoulder. Crowley stiffened, then let out a breath. A small amount of her tension went with it, and she placed her own hand over Aziraphale\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d he said. \u201cI can play along. But I wonder if you\u2019re\u2026. getting lost, rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can let it down with you,\u201d she said. \u201cSort of. But around any of them, even Warlock, <i>especially </i>Warlock\u2026 I <i>can\u2019t.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely let it down today at all,\u201d Aziraphale pointed out. \u201cHardly for the past month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Crowley. She licked her lips in a very Crowley way, forked tongue and everything.</p><p>\u201cI think I understand if it\u2019s easier that way,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cPretending you don\u2019t know me. Especially if Ashtoreth doesn\u2019t <i>know </i>about, well, <i>you know, </i>but, er.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who talked me into this, after all, and if you<i> must</i> stay in character, then perhaps we could at least\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Aziraphale,\u201d</i> Crowley said, turning to face him. She hesitated a moment. \u201cJust shut up and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Aziraphale, surprised. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Crowley nodded, so he did.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s lips were tense and tasted like lavender tea and Aziraphale kissed them gently once, twice, again, before Crowley stuck her hand in his hair and pulled him into something deeper with a lot more tongue. There was something desperate in the way she kissed, both delighted and frantic. It had been a long time since they\u2019d kissed like this, but both of them remembered the way.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s hands drifted to her back, holding her close as her rigid posture relaxed into a curve that used every one of her many vertebrae. He continued to hold her as they broke out of the kiss and she rested her forehead on his shoulder.</p><p>Aziraphale couldn\u2019t hold back his smile. \u201cI thought Ms. Ashtoreth wasn\u2019t the sort who did things like that,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Crowley sighed into his shoulder. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t her.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale chuckled and ran his hands down her back. \u201cGood morning, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He held her a moment longer, before Crowley stepped away and leaned back on the car, crossing her arms and looking very much not a proper nanny. \u201cI\u2019m glad we got to do that again before.

Aziraphale wiped a bead of sweat off his neck. He preferred to sweat, on principle, though if the summer kept on the way it had been going he would be sorely tempted to change his mind. Crowley did not sweat, and Aziraphale was unsure if that was because she chose not to, or it hadn\u2019t occurred to her, or perhaps, being a serpent, she was physically unable to. He didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast?\u201d Crowley asked, as always. As always, the answer was yes, and Crowley adjusted course for an outdoor caf\u00e9 that served marvelous scones.</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything, you know, <i>occult</i> about the boy?\u201d Aziraphale asked, thinking it better to get the worst out of the way first. As always, the answer was no.</p><p>For all its features, the one thing the Bentley didn\u2019t have was a strong air conditioning system. Aziraphale rolled down the window partway, but had to roll it up again when Crowley picked up speed. He miracled the air around him a few degrees cooler and turned slightly to watch Crowley as she drove. Everything about her was sort of desperately severe, from the tight bun of her hair to the furrow in her forehead to the purse of her mouth and the tight stillness of her hands on the steering wheel. He thought about putting one of his hands over hers, for comfort or to reassure himself of\u2026 something, but wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d allow it. She\u2019d been particularly aloof recently.</p><p>Accounts of Warlock\u2019s weekly developments carried them the rest of the way to the caf\u00e9 and halfway through breakfast, with both beings trying to focus so that they might spend the afternoon and evening really enjoying themselves.\u00a0</p><p>Then, \u201cwe\u2019re going to the zoo on Tuesday,\u201d Crowley said, pushing things forward a bit. She sipped her tea primly. The cup gave a sharp clink when she set it back in its saucer. \u201cYou ought to meet us there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Aziraphale ate a scone. \u201cWhy the zoo?\u201d he asked, though he was distracted by the subtle way Crowley rolled her shoulders and winced.\u00a0</p><p>For millennia, Crowley\u2019s spine had naturally assumed a snakey, almost boneless quality that, when she was relaxed, manifested in all manner of slouching, slinking, and draping herself over furniture. Now, Crowley normally held it to nearly human standards until it was time to get comfortable, but Nanny Ashtoreth was perpetually rigid as though she\u2019d been built around a ruler. It looked\u2026 uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the sort of thing one does with children,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cMr. Dowling is hosting a luncheon for some very important people, and it has been <i>suggested</i> that Warlock and I make ourselves scarce.\u201d The lift of her eyebrows indicated that it was a bit more than a suggestion, and also that she found the whole thing rather ridiculous. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s worried about. He hardly sees either of us as it is, and children make excellent conversation pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d said Aziraphale. He ate another scone and decided now was not the time to address Crowley\u2019s issues with the Dowlings\u2019 parenting strategy. He was not particularly partial to zoos, but it <i>would </i>be nice to get out for the day, and having the particulars of his work schedule slip people\u2019s minds was very easy indeed. \u201cShall I meet you at the bus stop, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cYou\u2019d better meet us there. By the giraffes, perhaps? They\u2019d be a bad example for the boy. They\u2019re selfish and malicious, you can see it in their eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly true, Dear. They\u2019re kind and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ineffable,\u201d </i>Aziraphale said, holding back his smile until Crowley scoffed. \u201cBut what do you mean I ought to meet you there? We\u2019re coming from the same place, aren\u2019t we? The Dowlings won\u2019t be any the wiser, and it\u2019s not as though Warlock will mind. He\u2019s quite fond of me you know.\u201d</p><p>Meeting at the bus stop on their days off had been Crowley\u2019s idea, because she didn\u2019t fancy the Dowlings thinking that Nanny Ashtoreth and Brother Francis were working together, or being <i>intimate </i>together, or even knew each other beyond the limits of their jobs. Aziraphale had agreed because it was more practical to play it safe than to alter the family\u2019s memories if they got upset, and because it reminded him, in a way, of the care they\u2019d taken in the days when the Arrangement was young and seemed far riskier than it had turned out to be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about what he <i>minds,</i>\u201d Crowley said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what he <i>thinks. </i>And Ms. Ashtoreth is <i>not</i> the sort of woman who picks up male company in secret. She might accept chance companionship during an outing, though, which is why you\u2019ve got to meet us there and pretend you knew nothing about it.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale mulled over this as he finished his tea. \u201cBut surely,\u201d he said. \u201cWarlock won\u2019t know the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAnd at any rate, <i>I will</i>. Ms. Ashtoreth is not a reckless woman. Nor is she a friendly one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale agreed.</p><p>\u201cShe carries the secret sadness of family estrangement and heartbreak, which have made her bitter,\u201d Crowley explained, sounding more and more like Ms. Ashtoreth with every word. \u201cShe trusts only herself to protect and corrupt the child in her care. It doesn\u2019t matter if she thinks Francis is resoundingly homosexual, she doesn\u2019t trust him enough to scoop him off the side of the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, it\u2019s really just you and me,\u201d Aziraphale said weakly, wondering when that had stopped being true.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just <i>you</i>,\u201d Crowley corrected, her voice sharp, brittle, and suddenly her own again. \u201cYou always manage to just be yourself, but with roses instead of books and disappearing around the side of the house instead of closing your shop, and they <i>believe</i> you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not <i>entirely </i>accurate,\u201d Aziraphale protested, this being easier to address then the vague unease Crowley\u2019s plan had sparked in him. \u201cI\u2019ve spent rather a lot of effort on the details of appearing human, the hobbies and the sweat and so forth. I just don\u2019t bother to completely change my character every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, that wouldn\u2019t <i>work </i>for me,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too late to change it now, anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They finished their breakfast in silence. Crowley was very stiff and controlled, and Aziraphale felt as though she were very far away. Without warning, she stood and placed a neatly folded stack of money on the table to pay their bill. Aziraphale tucked the last scone in his pocket then followed her to the car.\u00a0</p><p>Before she opened the door, Aziraphale finally chanced it and put a hand on her shoulder. Crowley stiffened, then let out a breath. A small amount of her tension went with it, and she placed her own hand over Aziraphale\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d he said. \u201cI can play along. But I wonder if you\u2019re\u2026. getting lost, rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can let it down with you,\u201d she said. \u201cSort of. But around any of them, even Warlock, <i>especially </i>Warlock\u2026 I <i>can\u2019t.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely let it down today at all,\u201d Aziraphale pointed out. \u201cHardly for the past month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Crowley. She licked her lips in a very Crowley way, forked tongue and everything.</p><p>\u201cI think I understand if it\u2019s easier that way,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cPretending you don\u2019t know me. Especially if Ashtoreth doesn\u2019t <i>know </i>about, well, <i>you know, </i>but, er.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who talked me into this, after all, and if you<i> must</i> stay in character, then perhaps we could at least\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Aziraphale,\u201d</i> Crowley said, turning to face him. She hesitated a moment. \u201cJust shut up and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Aziraphale, surprised. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Crowley nodded, so he did.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s lips were tense and tasted like lavender tea and Aziraphale kissed them gently once, twice, again, before Crowley stuck her hand in his hair and pulled him into something deeper with a lot more tongue. There was something desperate in the way she kissed, both delighted and frantic. It had been a long time since they\u2019d kissed like this, but both of them remembered the way.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s hands drifted to her back, holding her close as her rigid posture relaxed into a curve that used every one of her many vertebrae. He continued to hold her as they broke out of the kiss and she rested her forehead on his shoulder.</p><p>Aziraphale couldn\u2019t hold back his smile. \u201cI thought Ms. Ashtoreth wasn\u2019t the sort who did things like that,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Crowley sighed into his shoulder. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t her.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale chuckled and ran his hands down her back. \u201cGood morning, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He held her a moment longer, before Crowley stepped away and leaned back on the car, crossing her arms and looking very much not a proper nanny. \u201cI\u2019m glad we got to do that again before. Ah. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes. Quite.\u201d Aziraphale found he had nothing to do with his hands, and also that they were sweaty. He wiped them on his trousers.</p><p>For several minutes, nobody did anything. Aziraphale turned over thoughts about potentially kissing Crowley again, before he decided it was too soon to ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the zoo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cNo trouble, really.

He was not particularly partial to zoos, but it <i>would </i>be nice to get out for the day, and having the particulars of his work schedule slip people\u2019s minds was very easy indeed. \u201cShall I meet you at the bus stop, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cYou\u2019d better meet us there. By the giraffes, perhaps? They\u2019d be a bad example for the boy. They\u2019re selfish and malicious, you can see it in their eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly true, Dear. They\u2019re kind and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ineffable,\u201d </i>Aziraphale said, holding back his smile until Crowley scoffed. \u201cBut what do you mean I ought to meet you there? We\u2019re coming from the same place, aren\u2019t we? The Dowlings won\u2019t be any the wiser, and it\u2019s not as though Warlock will mind. He\u2019s quite fond of me you know.\u201d</p><p>Meeting at the bus stop on their days off had been Crowley\u2019s idea, because she didn\u2019t fancy the Dowlings thinking that Nanny Ashtoreth and Brother Francis were working together, or being <i>intimate </i>together, or even knew each other beyond the limits of their jobs. Aziraphale had agreed because it was more practical to play it safe than to alter the family\u2019s memories if they got upset, and because it reminded him, in a way, of the care they\u2019d taken in the days when the Arrangement was young and seemed far riskier than it had turned out to be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about what he <i>minds,</i>\u201d Crowley said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what he <i>thinks. </i>And Ms. Ashtoreth is <i>not</i> the sort of woman who picks up male company in secret. She might accept chance companionship during an outing, though, which is why you\u2019ve got to meet us there and pretend you knew nothing about it.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale mulled over this as he finished his tea. \u201cBut surely,\u201d he said. \u201cWarlock won\u2019t know the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAnd at any rate, <i>I will</i>. Ms. Ashtoreth is not a reckless woman. Nor is she a friendly one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale agreed.</p><p>\u201cShe carries the secret sadness of family estrangement and heartbreak, which have made her bitter,\u201d Crowley explained, sounding more and more like Ms. Ashtoreth with every word. \u201cShe trusts only herself to protect and corrupt the child in her care. It doesn\u2019t matter if she thinks Francis is resoundingly homosexual, she doesn\u2019t trust him enough to scoop him off the side of the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, it\u2019s really just you and me,\u201d Aziraphale said weakly, wondering when that had stopped being true.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just <i>you</i>,\u201d Crowley corrected, her voice sharp, brittle, and suddenly her own again. \u201cYou always manage to just be yourself, but with roses instead of books and disappearing around the side of the house instead of closing your shop, and they <i>believe</i> you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not <i>entirely </i>accurate,\u201d Aziraphale protested, this being easier to address then the vague unease Crowley\u2019s plan had sparked in him. \u201cI\u2019ve spent rather a lot of effort on the details of appearing human, the hobbies and the sweat and so forth. I just don\u2019t bother to completely change my character every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, that wouldn\u2019t <i>work </i>for me,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too late to change it now, anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They finished their breakfast in silence. Crowley was very stiff and controlled, and Aziraphale felt as though she were very far away. Without warning, she stood and placed a neatly folded stack of money on the table to pay their bill. Aziraphale tucked the last scone in his pocket then followed her to the car.\u00a0</p><p>Before she opened the door, Aziraphale finally chanced it and put a hand on her shoulder. Crowley stiffened, then let out a breath. A small amount of her tension went with it, and she placed her own hand over Aziraphale\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d he said. \u201cI can play along. But I wonder if you\u2019re\u2026. getting lost, rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can let it down with you,\u201d she said. \u201cSort of. But around any of them, even Warlock, <i>especially </i>Warlock\u2026 I <i>can\u2019t.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely let it down today at all,\u201d Aziraphale pointed out. \u201cHardly for the past month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Crowley. She licked her lips in a very Crowley way, forked tongue and everything.</p><p>\u201cI think I understand if it\u2019s easier that way,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cPretending you don\u2019t know me. Especially if Ashtoreth doesn\u2019t <i>know </i>about, well, <i>you know, </i>but, er.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who talked me into this, after all, and if you<i> must</i> stay in character, then perhaps we could at least\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Aziraphale,\u201d</i> Crowley said, turning to face him. She hesitated a moment. \u201cJust shut up and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Aziraphale, surprised. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Crowley nodded, so he did.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s lips were tense and tasted like lavender tea and Aziraphale kissed them gently once, twice, again, before Crowley stuck her hand in his hair and pulled him into something deeper with a lot more tongue. There was something desperate in the way she kissed, both delighted and frantic. It had been a long time since they\u2019d kissed like this, but both of them remembered the way.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s hands drifted to her back, holding her close as her rigid posture relaxed into a curve that used every one of her many vertebrae. He continued to hold her as they broke out of the kiss and she rested her forehead on his shoulder.</p><p>Aziraphale couldn\u2019t hold back his smile. \u201cI thought Ms. Ashtoreth wasn\u2019t the sort who did things like that,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Crowley sighed into his shoulder. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t her.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale chuckled and ran his hands down her back. \u201cGood morning, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He held her a moment longer, before Crowley stepped away and leaned back on the car, crossing her arms and looking very much not a proper nanny. \u201cI\u2019m glad we got to do that again before. Ah. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes. Quite.\u201d Aziraphale found he had nothing to do with his hands, and also that they were sweaty. He wiped them on his trousers.</p><p>For several minutes, nobody did anything. Aziraphale turned over thoughts about potentially kissing Crowley again, before he decided it was too soon to ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the zoo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cNo trouble, really. By the giraffes, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTuesday,\u201d Crowley agreed. She stood up and opened the Bentley door. \u201cWhere was it you wanted to go today? Art gallery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere besides the zoo,\u201d Aziraphale said as he climbed in the other side of the car.\u00a0</p><p>When Crowley pulled away, only one hand was tight around the wheel. Aziraphale was holding the other.</p></p>",

For some reason, no one could ever remember his schedule. He would leave through the front gate and walk quietly down the road to the bus stop, a mile or so away. It was time to think, he said, on the rare occasion when someone offered him a lift. He just wanted to walk through the sunrise and think.</p><p>About an hour later, every Thursday, Nanny Ashtoreth would wake inside the house, check on sleeping Warlock, and hiss quiet advice to Ms. Dowling as to how the child had been getting on. Then she would pick up her umbrella and carpetbag and walk out the front gate and down the road away from town, in the opposite direction of the bus stop. She was an ominous blot on the vaguely pastoral, somewhat developed area, and her shoes clacked loudly whether she was walking on concrete, or a dirt road, or on the grass. In the year and a half she&rsquo;d been with the family, no one had managed to find out where she went. No one had felt inclined to try very hard.&nbsp;</p><p>By this time, Brother Francis would be standing beside the bus stop, waving away each of the two busses that came by at this time on a Thursday. He entertained himself by doing small acts of kindness for the driver and the passengers, because that was the sort of person he was, and small acts of malice, because Nanny Ashtoreth rarely encountered anyone on such mornings and it was good to keep things balanced.</p><p>About half an hour after Nanny Ashtoreth had left the Dowling&rsquo;s house, an old black Bentley drove past the front drive. It shone like new despite having spent the past week hidden in a conveniently large shrub, and no one knew who it belonged to. Not that they&rsquo;d tried very hard to find out.</p><p>Ten minutes after that, the Bentley pulled up to the bus stop, the passenger door cracked open, and Crowley said &ldquo;get in, Angel,&rdquo; as Aziraphale said &ldquo;good morning, Dear.&rdquo;</p><p>This particular Thursday happened to be in early of August, and it was already uncomfortably warm. Aziraphale wiped a bead of sweat off his neck. He preferred to sweat, on principle, though if the summer kept on the way it had been going he would be sorely tempted to change his mind. Crowley did not sweat, and Aziraphale was unsure if that was because she chose not to, or it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to her, or perhaps, being a serpent, she was physically unable to. He didn&rsquo;t ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Breakfast?&rdquo; Crowley asked, as always. As always, the answer was yes, and Crowley adjusted course for an outdoor caf&eacute; that served marvelous scones.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you noticed anything, you know, <i>occult</i> about the boy?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked, thinking it better to get the worst out of the way first. As always, the answer was no.</p><p>For all its features, the one thing the Bentley didn&rsquo;t have was a strong air conditioning system. Aziraphale rolled down the window partway, but had to roll it up again when Crowley picked up speed. He miracled the air around him a few degrees cooler and turned slightly to watch Crowley as she drove. Everything about her was sort of desperately severe, from the tight bun of her hair to the furrow in her forehead to the purse of her mouth and the tight stillness of her hands on the steering wheel. He thought about putting one of his hands over hers, for comfort or to reassure himself of&hellip; something, but wasn&rsquo;t sure if she&rsquo;d allow it. She&rsquo;d been particularly aloof recently.</p><p>Accounts of Warlock&rsquo;s weekly developments carried them the rest of the way to the caf&eacute; and halfway through breakfast, with both beings trying to focus so that they might spend the afternoon and evening really enjoying themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to the zoo on Tuesday,&rdquo; Crowley said, pushing things forward a bit. She sipped her tea primly. The cup gave a sharp clink when she set it back in its saucer. &ldquo;You ought to meet us there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Aziraphale ate a scone. &ldquo;Why the zoo?&rdquo; he asked, though he was distracted by the subtle way Crowley rolled her shoulders and winced.&nbsp;</p><p>For millennia, Crowley&rsquo;s spine had naturally assumed a snakey, almost boneless quality that, when she was relaxed, manifested in all manner of slouching, slinking, and draping herself over furniture. Now, Crowley normally held it to nearly human standards until it was time to get comfortable, but Nanny Ashtoreth was perpetually rigid as though she&rsquo;d been built around a ruler. It looked&hellip; uncomfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sort of thing one does with children,&rdquo; Crowley said. &ldquo;Mr. Dowling is hosting a luncheon for some very important people, and it has been <i>suggested</i> that Warlock and I make ourselves scarce.&rdquo; The lift of her eyebrows indicated that it was a bit more than a suggestion, and also that she found the whole thing rather ridiculous. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s worried about. He hardly sees either of us as it is, and children make excellent conversation pieces.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; said Aziraphale. He ate another scone and decided now was not the time to address Crowley&rsquo;s issues with the Dowlings&rsquo; parenting strategy. He was not particularly partial to zoos, but it <i>would </i>be nice to get out for the day, and having the particulars of his work schedule slip people&rsquo;s minds was very easy indeed. &ldquo;Shall I meet you at the bus stop, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Crowley said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better meet us there.
