Shit.</p><p>This isn\u2019t\nat all how Poppy imagined this moment, she was supposed to be married, and\nhappy and living close to her family, and financially stable enough to take at\nleast two years off work, so that she could be a mum. Instead, she was single,\nmiserable and living on the opposite side of the world to her family. The only\nthings keeping her sane were her job and Harry.</p><p>She was\ncertain that it would come back negative, she\u2019d known her entire adult life\nthat getting pregnant would be almost impossible because of her condition and\nhere she was, standing in the bathroom of her London flat, staring at a\npositive pregnancy test and she didn\u2019t know how to feel. There was no way she\ncould raise a baby on her own, but this was everything she\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>Poppy\ncouldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been so stupid; how could she have forgotten the condom\nthat night with Danny? She wasn\u2019t on the pill, she wasn\u2019t supposed to be able\nto have children, but she always, always, used condoms. How could she have\nforgotten? She was drunk, and the thought never even crossed her mind, but\nChrist, how could she have been so stupid?</p><p>Again, two\npink blue lines. She was pregnant.</p><!-- more --><p>Herr hands\nmoved towards her stomach and the tears began streaming down her face. She\ndidn\u2019t know what to do next, no one ever tells you what to do next.</p><p>She leant\nher back against the counter, and slid down, resting her elbows on her knees\nand covered her eyes with her hands, she let herself go. Tears ran down her\ncheeks for what felt like hours and after letting herself cry for a while, she\nstood up and washed her face, drying her eyes and looking at herself in the\nmirror.</p><p>\u201cYou have\nto be strong Poppy Marie\u201d she said to herself \u201cYou\u2019re a mum now, you can\u2019t\nbreak like this.\u201d</p><p>She walked\nout of the bathroom, and into the kitchen, putting the kettle on to make a cup\nof tea while she searched for her phone. She found it under the magazine she\nwas reading before she remembered that her period was late, and she dialled\nHarry\u2019s number with no answer which made her throw her phone down on the\ncounter, before pouring herself a tea. She sat down on the couch tea in hand\nand tried Harry again, and received the same pre-recorded voice message.\nSighing loudly, she tried again, this time she left \u00a0a voice message.</p><p>\u201cChrist\nHarry, you\u2019re the most sought-after man in the world right now and you won\u2019t\npick up your bloody phone when I need you\u201d frustration was evident in her voice\n\u201cCall me as soon as you get this please, I need you.\u201d</p><p>A few hours\npast and there was still no word from Harry. She knew that he had meetings all\nday, and a rehearsal tonight, but she figured that he would have a chance to\ncheck his phone at least once throughout the afternoon. None of this felt real\nto right now, she needed to talk to someone, to tell them, before she could believe\nit herself.</p><p>The pasta\nwas boiling over and she was about to burn the sauce when her phone buzzed,\nshowing Harry\u2019s face on the screen.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d she\nanswered, stress and frustration evident in her voice</p><p>\u201cHey,\nsorry, I just got your message, everything ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, maybe,\nI don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiiight\u201d\nhe said confused \u201cWhat\u2019s going on Pop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot, I\nneed to tell you something\u201d she turned the stove off and frowned at her burnt\ndinner</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all\nears\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you\ncome over? Or are you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just\nfinished for the day, I\u2019m on my way\u201d she could hear him walking towards his car</p><p>\u201cCan you\nbring food?\u201d</p><p>She heard\nhim giggle through the phone \u201cSure, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmmm\u201d she\nlooked at the meal she had attempted to cook for herself \u201canything but pasta\u201d</p><p>\u201cWagamamas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\nthe usual pleaseee\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll\nsee you soon\u201d she heard him open his car door</p><p>\u201cByeeeeee\u201d\nshe said into the phone before she hung up.</p><p>***</p><p>Poppy was\nsitting on a stool at her kitchen bench, staring into blank space, with her\nhand on her belly. There couldn\u2019t be a baby in there, could there? It was still\nso flat, there was not even the slightest indication that she was growing a\ntiny human inside of her, besides her late period. The doorbell rang,\nsignalling Harry\u2019s arrival, and tearing her out of her trance.</p><p>\u201c \u2018s open\u201d\nshe yelled, still not bothered to move from her chair</p><p>\u201cHands are\nfull love, can you let me in?\u201d</p><p>She rolled\nher eyes and dragged herself over to the door, opening it and immediately\nheading back to her spot.</p><p>\u201cWell hello\nto you too\u201d Harry said, walking in with a box full of food</p><p>\u201cYeah Hi\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s\ngrumpy\u201d he put the box on her counter and opened her cupboard, grabbing out two\nplates</p><p>\u201cI burnt my\ndinner\u201d she sighed, taking out the cutlery and handing him a set</p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d he\nnodded \u201cSo you\u2019re hangry\u201d</p><p>Spooning\nthe food into her plate, Poppy tried her best to act like hunger is all that\nwas bothering her , but Harry saw straight through her.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed\npretty upset in your voice message love, what was bothering you\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na deep breath and put her fork down, wiping her face with a napkin \u201cI\u2019m\u2026.\u201d She\nfroze, staring into blank space again.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\u201d\nHarry put his fork down too, moving his chair closer to her and placing his\nhand over hers \u201cwhatever it is love, you can tell me\u201d</p><p>She knew\nthat, he\u2019s been there for her since the day they met, he\u2019s the only person she\ntrusts enough to tell, but she just couldn\u2019t get the words out. She took a deep\nbreath, holding in the tears \u201cHarry\u201d she said, still not making eye contact\nwith him \u201cI\u2019m pregnant\u201d</p><p>Harry froze\nfor a moment, letting the information sink in, puffing air out through his\nlips, making them vibrate, \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that\u201d he admitted, placing his\nhand on her check \u201clook at me love,\u201d Poppy turned her face and her teary eyes\nlooked into his \u201cwe\u2019ll work this out\u201d he stood so that he could wrap his arms\naround her body letting her sob into his chest, stroking her back and hushing\nuntil she calmed down. When she pulled away from his hug, he grabbed her hand\nand took her over to the couch, sitting her down and putting his arm around her\nagain. </p><p>\u201cIs it\nDanny\u2019s?\u201d he asked tentatively, after ten minutes of silence. She nodded,\nunable to form words. \u201cWhat do you want to do Pop? You\u2019ve got a choice here\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nkeeping it Harry\u201d she said, a little offended that he would even suggest the\nalternative, knowing how much she always wanted this.</p><p>\u201cWell then\ncongratulations is in order\u201d he rubbed his hand up and down her shoulder trying\nto comfort her \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a mum Poppy, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve always wanted\u201d</p><p>A smile\nstretched across her face, hearing Harry say it finally made it feel real,\nplacing her hand on her lower belly she repeated what Harry just said \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to be a mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter\nmake me god father\u201d Harry said, placing his hand over hers</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t\nthink of someone better H\u201d letting out a deep sigh, she hopped up off the couch\nand grabbed both their plates off the counter, \u201cMumma\u2019s gotta eat\u201d she giggled.</p><p>They spent\nthe next few hours talking about the baby and Harry\u2019s plans for the next few\nmonths. The meetings he had today were about his tour that he was about to\nannounce. His album comes out in a few weeks and his schedule was hectic for\nthe rest of the year, but he assured her that he would be there for her, for\nthe entire pregnancy, he was going to be away, but for no longer than a month\nat a time and he would always be just a phone call away.</p><p>It was\ngetting late and Poppy\u2019s eyes were getting heavy when Harry got up started to\nclean up after dinner. \u201cStay here tonight H?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t\nwant to stay anywhere else\u201d he said looking at the still full box of food \u201cI\nmay have ordered too much\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\nIt won\u2019t go to waste\u201d she said, putting the containers in the fridge.</p><p>Once all\nthe food was away and their plates were in the dishwasher, Poppy started to get\nready for bed, taking a shower and cleaning her teeth while Harry searched her\nroom for the spare boxers he kept in the flat for nights like these when he\nstayed without planning on it. There wasn\u2019t much room in the flat, so whenever\nHarry stayed they shared a bed, he was too tall for the couch and there was no\nway he was sleeping on the floor. As they both got into bed, Harry looked at\nher sternly. \u201cYou have to tell him you know\u201d he said, referring to Danny.</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d\nPoppy sighed \u201cI don\u2019t want him involved though\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a\ngood guy Pop\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\nget that vibe\u201d she confessed \u201cHe was kind of a dick\u201d</p><p>Harry\nturned his head on the pillow to look at her \u201cI know this is none of my\nbusiness, but did you use a condom?\u201d</p><p>She shook\nher head \u201cIt was over so quickly, the thought never even crossed my mind\u201d she\nreached over to switch the lamp off \u201cdude didn\u2019t even last a minute\u201d</p><p>Harry let a\nslight chuckle \u201cHe still deserves to know\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\nbut I\u2019m going to need his number\u201d she laughed</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know\nthat I have it\u201d Harry admitted, \u201cBut we\u2019ll get it somehow\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\npredicted the future H\u201d she said, through a yawn</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou mean?\u201d he asked, confused</p><p>\u201cKiwi.\u201d</p><p>He laughed,\n\u201cI guess I did\u201d he said through laughter \u201cI\u2019m sorry love\u201d</p><p>They both\ngiggled together at the irony of the situation, making jokes about the song and\nDanny.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no\nway you were working your way through a cheap pack of cigarettes that night\u201d he\ngiggled</p><p>\u201cI might\nhave been, you were too busy with Ali to notice\u201d</p><p>He grabbed\nthe pillow out from under his head, playfully hitting her torso with it \u201cexcuse\nme, it was my launch party, I should have been the one getting laid that night\u201d</p><p>Poppy\ngasped sarcastically, \u201cI stole your thunder\u201d she giggled</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE\nHAVING HIS BABY\u201d he sang at the top of his lungs to the tune of kiwi, laughing\nas he sang.</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S NONE\nOF HIS BUSINESS\u201d she joined him, not sounding nearly as good as he did, but it\nhelped, there was something about lying next to harry, screaming at the top of\nher lungs, that made all the stress and worry go away, even if it was just for\nfive minutes.</p><p>Eventually,\nthey both drifted off to sleep, calling it a night after singing Kiwi for the\nthird time. When they woke up the next morning, her throat was scratchy from\nall the screaming and she felt a little nauseous, she wasn\u2019t sure if it was\nmorning sickness or nerves, but there was no way she could keep any food down.</p><p>The next\nmorning, Harry tracked down Danny\u2019s number for you and Poppy sent him a text:</p><p><i>\u201cHi Danny,\nit\u2019s Poppy from a couple of weeks ago, you probably don\u2019t remember me, but I\nneed to talk to you, coffee at 10? </i></p><p>Ten anxious\nminutes later, her phone buzzed on the coffee table with a reply </p><p><i>\u201cI remember\nyou Poppy, couldn\u2019t stay away huh? 10am at coffee lab?\u201d</i></p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes and threw her phone to Harry when she read his reply \u201cWhy did\nyou ever set me up with this knobhead H?</p><p>\u201cChrist\u201d he\nsighed \u201cMaybe stop taking my advice yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit\nlate for that now, come with me? I don\u2019t think I can do this alone\u201d</p><p>He nodded,\nbiting into his banana, \u201cI\u2019ll come with, but I\u2019ll sit at another table until\nyou need me\u201d</p><p>She agreed\nthat it would be weird for Harry to tell him with her , but she definitely\nneeded the support, she didn\u2019t know how to tell him that she was pregnant with\nhis child and she certainly didn\u2019t know how to tell him that she didn\u2019t want or\nneed him to have anything to do with it.</p><p>Poppy got\nready slowly that morning, trying her best to post pone the inevitable. It was\nten to ten by the time she was ready to leave the house and it was a\ntwenty-minute drive to Coffee Lab, so she was running late and she\u2019d hoped that\nDanny had somewhere to be by 11 so the meeting would be short and sweet. Or not\nso sweet, but definitely short.</p><p>Poppy and\nHarry walked in the door, side by side, and spotted Danny immediately. Harry\nducked away and sat at the empty table a few feet away from Poppy, still within\nearshot, if she needed him.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d she\nsaid shyly as she sat down opposite Danny. He leant across the table and placed\na kiss on her cheek. She shied away from the kiss and overheard Harry scoffing\nat his table, clearly annoyed by Danny\u2019s to greeting. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good\nto see you again Poppy, surprised you stayed away this long\u201d he said\nconfidently, and she laughed nervously \u201cI ordered you a cappuccino, hope that\u2019s\nok\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\ndrink coffee, but that\u2019s ok\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d he\nsaid, taken a back, \u201cSorry. So why did you need to see me urgently?\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na deep breath and tried to transport herself back to last night, when she was\ntelling Harry. She was nervous then, but nothing like this. She looked over at\nHarry, who was watching her, waiting for his cue. \u201cDanny\u201d she breathed \u201cI\u2019m\npregnant.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything but, all the colour had drained from his\nface, so she kept talking, thinking that it would be easier if he didn\u2019t\nrespond. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be involved, it was one night, it doesn\u2019t have to\nruin your entire life.\u201d</p><p>The colour\nreturned to his face, \u201cGood.\u201d He said flatly \u201cdon\u2019t be hitting me up for child\nsupport in 5 years when you\u2019re broke and alone\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\ndo that\u201d she said quietly</p><p>\u201cNo,\nbecause you\u2019ll have that rich boy toy over there to pay you to go down on him\u201d\nwith that Harry stood up and made his way over to the table, nostrils flaring.\nHe grabbed her hand and helped her up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\ndare talk to her like that\u201d he said quietly, trying not to make a scene \u201cthis\nis your loss mate, not hers. Don\u2019t expect to be hearing from either of us\nagain, next time you need work, I won\u2019t be helping you out\u201d</p><p>They both\nleft the caf\u00e9 and walked straight to Harry\u2019s car, neither of them spoke a word\nto each other, for the entirety of the car trip, it took until they made it\nback inside the flat for someone to open their mouth.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nPoppy said, closing the door behind her</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nbelieve I have to pay the knob\u201d he said shaking his head</p><p>***</p><p>May 5<sup>th</sup> 2017</p><p>Harry\nstayed by Poppy\u2019s side for the next few days, leaving her only once to go home\nand get some clean clothes. She knew this wouldn\u2019t last though, his album came\nout in a week and he had a week-long residency on The Late Late Show, which\nmeant he would need to be in L.A.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s\nhead hovered over the toilet bowl, staring at what was once \u00a0the contents\nof her stomach, taking deep breaths hoping that she wouldn\u2019t vomit again. Harry\nstood outside the door, waiting for her to come out, he heard the toilet flush\nand she opened the door, looking pale and sweaty.</p><p>\u201cPoppy, I\nknow this is just morning sickness, but I really think you need to make a\ndoctor\u2019s appointment, make sure everything\u2019s ok with you and the baby\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared\nH\u201d</p><p>He looked\nat her, a look of concern on his face \u201cI\u2019ll come with you\u201d he reached his hands\nout and brought her in for a hug \u201cI\u2019ll even book the appointment for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine\u201d she\nsaid, pulling away from the hug and rushing back to the bathroom, slamming the\ndoor behind her</p><p>Harry\nbooked the appointment for that afternoon, because he knew they were both free.\nSince finding out she was pregnant Poppy decided to drop her work load to 4\ndays a week, but she\u2019d promised big boss Ben that\u2019d she\u2019d always be within\nreach and doing what needed to be done from home. </p><p>Poppy was\nno stranger to doctor\u2019s offices, having an array of minor medical issues her\nentire life, she\u2019d spent her fair share of time in doctors waiting rooms, but\nthey still made her nervous. Harry sat next her, trying to calm her down by\npointing out the ridiculous articles in the tabloid magazines that littered the\ntable next to him.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\nThomas\u201d the doctor walked out of his office. They both stood and walked towards\nhim, taking their seats again once they were in his office. Poppy has been\nseeing the same doctor since she moved to the UK, so he understood most of her\nmedical history pretty well, but not as well as her doctor back in Australia.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I\ndo for you today Poppy\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\npregnant\u201d she said without hesitation, it had been a week since she found out\nand it finally felt real</p><p>\u201cCongratulations\u201d\nthe doctor nodded \u201cThis must be Dad then?\u201d he said looking at Harry. They both\nlooked at each other and laughed</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Poppy\nsaid, \u201cDad\u2019s not in the picture, Harry\u2019s just here for support, he\u2019s a strong\ncontender for God Father\u201d</p><p>The doctor\nlaughed \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re successful then\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready been offered the position\u201d Harry laughed with him</p><p>\u201cWonderful\u201d\nthe doctor said turning towards Poppy \u201cNow Poppy, we\u2019ll need to do some blood\nwork to confirm, but with your condition we\u2019ll need to keep a close eye on you\nin the first 12 weeks, pregnancies like these are considered high risk, so I\u2019d\nlike to get you in for a scan with the early pregnancy unit, as soon as we\ncan.\u201d She nodded along, grabbing onto Harry\u2019s hand \u201cWhen was your last period?\u201d</p><p>She thought\nback to before the release party \u201caround St Patrick Day\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when\ndid you last have sex?\u201d She felt Harry\u2019s grip tighten on her hand </p><p>\u201cApril 7<sup>th</sup>\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat puts\nyou at roughly four weeks pregnant, and the earliest you can have a scan is 6\nweeks, so we\u2019ll schedule that in for two weeks\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds\ngood\u201d she nodded nervously</p><p>\u201cIn the\nmeantime, I don\u2019t want you to worry about this, just take it easy, and you need\nto be taking prenatal vitamins\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat I wanted to ask, which brand is best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nkeep up with brands, but I recommend any that are high in folic acid and, in\nyour case, with your history of Thyroid trouble, I would suggest one that is\nhigh in iodine as well.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nturned to Harry, who had his phone out writing down what the doctor just said,\n\u201cDid you get that H?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he\nsqueezed her hand</p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d,\nthe doctor said, \u201cthat\u2019s about all I can do this visit, come back in a few days\nonce we get the blood work back and we\u2019ll go through everything again\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nboth you and Harry said in unison, standing up to leave. She left the room and\nwaited another ten minutes for the nurse to call her in for her blood test.\nAfter that, they left the doctors surgery, full of anxiety about the pregnancy.\nPoppy knew that getting pregnant would be hard, but she\u2019d always assumed that\nif it happened, it would be like any other. For the rest of the afternoon,\nHarry remained close to her, not directly asking her about what the doctor had\nsaid, but making sure that she was ok.</p>",

She\ndidn\u2019t know what to do next, no one ever tells you what to do next.</p><p>She leant\nher back against the counter, and slid down, resting her elbows on her knees\nand covered her eyes with her hands, she let herself go. Tears ran down her\ncheeks for what felt like hours and after letting herself cry for a while, she\nstood up and washed her face, drying her eyes and looking at herself in the\nmirror.</p><p>\u201cYou have\nto be strong Poppy Marie\u201d she said to herself \u201cYou\u2019re a mum now, you can\u2019t\nbreak like this.\u201d</p><p>She walked\nout of the bathroom, and into the kitchen, putting the kettle on to make a cup\nof tea while she searched for her phone. She found it under the magazine she\nwas reading before she remembered that her period was late, and she dialled\nHarry\u2019s number with no answer which made her throw her phone down on the\ncounter, before pouring herself a tea. She sat down on the couch tea in hand\nand tried Harry again, and received the same pre-recorded voice message.\nSighing loudly, she tried again, this time she left \u00a0a voice message.</p><p>\u201cChrist\nHarry, you\u2019re the most sought-after man in the world right now and you won\u2019t\npick up your bloody phone when I need you\u201d frustration was evident in her voice\n\u201cCall me as soon as you get this please, I need you.\u201d</p><p>A few hours\npast and there was still no word from Harry. She knew that he had meetings all\nday, and a rehearsal tonight, but she figured that he would have a chance to\ncheck his phone at least once throughout the afternoon. None of this felt real\nto right now, she needed to talk to someone, to tell them, before she could believe\nit herself.</p><p>The pasta\nwas boiling over and she was about to burn the sauce when her phone buzzed,\nshowing Harry\u2019s face on the screen.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d she\nanswered, stress and frustration evident in her voice</p><p>\u201cHey,\nsorry, I just got your message, everything ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, maybe,\nI don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiiight\u201d\nhe said confused \u201cWhat\u2019s going on Pop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot, I\nneed to tell you something\u201d she turned the stove off and frowned at her burnt\ndinner</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all\nears\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you\ncome over?

There couldn\u2019t be a baby in there, could there? It was still\nso flat, there was not even the slightest indication that she was growing a\ntiny human inside of her, besides her late period. The doorbell rang,\nsignalling Harry\u2019s arrival, and tearing her out of her trance.</p><p>\u201c \u2018s open\u201d\nshe yelled, still not bothered to move from her chair</p><p>\u201cHands are\nfull love, can you let me in?\u201d</p><p>She rolled\nher eyes and dragged herself over to the door, opening it and immediately\nheading back to her spot.</p><p>\u201cWell hello\nto you too\u201d Harry said, walking in with a box full of food</p><p>\u201cYeah Hi\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s\ngrumpy\u201d he put the box on her counter and opened her cupboard, grabbing out two\nplates</p><p>\u201cI burnt my\ndinner\u201d she sighed, taking out the cutlery and handing him a set</p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d he\nnodded \u201cSo you\u2019re hangry\u201d</p><p>Spooning\nthe food into her plate, Poppy tried her best to act like hunger is all that\nwas bothering her , but Harry saw straight through her.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed\npretty upset in your voice message love, what was bothering you\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na deep breath and put her fork down, wiping her face with a napkin \u201cI\u2019m\u2026.\u201d She\nfroze, staring into blank space again.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\u201d\nHarry put his fork down too, moving his chair closer to her and placing his\nhand over hers \u201cwhatever it is love, you can tell me\u201d</p><p>She knew\nthat, he\u2019s been there for her since the day they met, he\u2019s the only person she\ntrusts enough to tell, but she just couldn\u2019t get the words out. She took a deep\nbreath, holding in the tears \u201cHarry\u201d she said, still not making eye contact\nwith him \u201cI\u2019m pregnant\u201d</p><p>Harry froze\nfor a moment, letting the information sink in, puffing air out through his\nlips, making them vibrate, \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that\u201d he admitted, placing his\nhand on her check \u201clook at me love,\u201d Poppy turned her face and her teary eyes\nlooked into his \u201cwe\u2019ll work this out\u201d he stood so that he could wrap his arms\naround her body letting her sob into his chest, stroking her back and hushing\nuntil she calmed down. When she pulled away from his hug, he grabbed her hand\nand took her over to the couch, sitting her down and putting his arm around her\nagain. </p><p>\u201cIs it\nDanny\u2019s?\u201d he asked tentatively, after ten minutes of silence. She nodded,\nunable to form words. \u201cWhat do you want to do Pop? You\u2019ve got a choice here\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nkeeping it Harry\u201d she said, a little offended that he would even suggest the\nalternative, knowing how much she always wanted this.</p><p>\u201cWell then\ncongratulations is in order\u201d he rubbed his hand up and down her shoulder trying\nto comfort her \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a mum Poppy, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve always wanted\u201d</p><p>A smile\nstretched across her face, hearing Harry say it finally made it feel real,\nplacing her hand on her lower belly she repeated what Harry just said \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to be a mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter\nmake me god father\u201d Harry said, placing his hand over hers</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t\nthink of someone better H\u201d letting out a deep sigh, she hopped up off the couch\nand grabbed both their plates off the counter, \u201cMumma\u2019s gotta eat\u201d she giggled.</p><p>They spent\nthe next few hours talking about the baby and Harry\u2019s plans for the next few\nmonths. The meetings he had today were about his tour that he was about to\nannounce. His album comes out in a few weeks and his schedule was hectic for\nthe rest of the year, but he assured her that he would be there for her, for\nthe entire pregnancy, he was going to be away, but for no longer than a month\nat a time and he would always be just a phone call away.</p><p>It was\ngetting late and Poppy\u2019s eyes were getting heavy when Harry got up started to\nclean up after dinner. \u201cStay here tonight H?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t\nwant to stay anywhere else\u201d he said looking at the still full box of food \u201cI\nmay have ordered too much\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\nIt won\u2019t go to waste\u201d she said, putting the containers in the fridge.</p><p>Once all\nthe food was away and their plates were in the dishwasher, Poppy started to get\nready for bed, taking a shower and cleaning her teeth while Harry searched her\nroom for the spare boxers he kept in the flat for nights like these when he\nstayed without planning on it. There wasn\u2019t much room in the flat, so whenever\nHarry stayed they shared a bed, he was too tall for the couch and there was no\nway he was sleeping on the floor. As they both got into bed, Harry looked at\nher sternly. \u201cYou have to tell him you know\u201d he said, referring to Danny.</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d\nPoppy sighed \u201cI don\u2019t want him involved though\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a\ngood guy Pop\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\nget that vibe\u201d she confessed \u201cHe was kind of a dick\u201d</p><p>Harry\nturned his head on the pillow to look at her \u201cI know this is none of my\nbusiness, but did you use a condom?\u201d</p><p>She shook\nher head \u201cIt was over so quickly, the thought never even crossed my mind\u201d she\nreached over to switch the lamp off \u201cdude didn\u2019t even last a minute\u201d</p><p>Harry let a\nslight chuckle \u201cHe still deserves to know\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\nbut I\u2019m going to need his number\u201d she laughed</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know\nthat I have it\u201d Harry admitted, \u201cBut we\u2019ll get it somehow\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\npredicted the future H\u201d she said, through a yawn</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou mean?\u201d he asked, confused</p><p>\u201cKiwi.\u201d</p><p>He laughed,\n\u201cI guess I did\u201d he said through laughter \u201cI\u2019m sorry love\u201d</p><p>They both\ngiggled together at the irony of the situation, making jokes about the song and\nDanny.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no\nway you were working your way through a cheap pack of cigarettes that night\u201d he\ngiggled</p><p>\u201cI might\nhave been, you were too busy with Ali to notice\u201d</p><p>He grabbed\nthe pillow out from under his head, playfully hitting her torso with it \u201cexcuse\nme, it was my launch party, I should have been the one getting laid that night\u201d</p><p>Poppy\ngasped sarcastically, \u201cI stole your thunder\u201d she giggled</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE\nHAVING HIS BABY\u201d he sang at the top of his lungs to the tune of kiwi, laughing\nas he sang.</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S NONE\nOF HIS BUSINESS\u201d she joined him, not sounding nearly as good as he did, but it\nhelped, there was something about lying next to harry, screaming at the top of\nher lungs, that made all the stress and worry go away, even if it was just for\nfive minutes.</p><p>Eventually,\nthey both drifted off to sleep, calling it a night after singing Kiwi for the\nthird time. When they woke up the next morning, her throat was scratchy from\nall the screaming and she felt a little nauseous, she wasn\u2019t sure if it was\nmorning sickness or nerves, but there was no way she could keep any food down.</p><p>The next\nmorning, Harry tracked down Danny\u2019s number for you and Poppy sent him a text:</p><p><i>\u201cHi Danny,\nit\u2019s Poppy from a couple of weeks ago, you probably don\u2019t remember me, but I\nneed to talk to you, coffee at 10? </i></p><p>Ten anxious\nminutes later, her phone buzzed on the coffee table with a reply </p><p><i>\u201cI remember\nyou Poppy, couldn\u2019t stay away huh? 10am at coffee lab?\u201d</i></p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes and threw her phone to Harry when she read his reply \u201cWhy did\nyou ever set me up with this knobhead H?</p><p>\u201cChrist\u201d he\nsighed \u201cMaybe stop taking my advice yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit\nlate for that now, come with me? I don\u2019t think I can do this alone\u201d</p><p>He nodded,\nbiting into his banana, \u201cI\u2019ll come with, but I\u2019ll sit at another table until\nyou need me\u201d</p><p>She agreed\nthat it would be weird for Harry to tell him with her , but she definitely\nneeded the support, she didn\u2019t know how to tell him that she was pregnant with\nhis child and she certainly didn\u2019t know how to tell him that she didn\u2019t want or\nneed him to have anything to do with it.</p><p>Poppy got\nready slowly that morning, trying her best to post pone the inevitable. It was\nten to ten by the time she was ready to leave the house and it was a\ntwenty-minute drive to Coffee Lab, so she was running late and she\u2019d hoped that\nDanny had somewhere to be by 11 so the meeting would be short and sweet. Or not\nso sweet, but definitely short.</p><p>Poppy and\nHarry walked in the door, side by side, and spotted Danny immediately. Harry\nducked away and sat at the empty table a few feet away from Poppy, still within\nearshot, if she needed him.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d she\nsaid shyly as she sat down opposite Danny. He leant across the table and placed\na kiss on her cheek. She shied away from the kiss and overheard Harry scoffing\nat his table, clearly annoyed by Danny\u2019s to greeting. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good\nto see you again Poppy, surprised you stayed away this long\u201d he said\nconfidently, and she laughed nervously \u201cI ordered you a cappuccino, hope that\u2019s\nok\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\ndrink coffee, but that\u2019s ok\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d he\nsaid, taken a back, \u201cSorry. So why did you need to see me urgently?\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na deep breath and tried to transport herself back to last night, when she was\ntelling Harry. She was nervous then, but nothing like this. She looked over at\nHarry, who was watching her, waiting for his cue. \u201cDanny\u201d she breathed \u201cI\u2019m\npregnant.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything but, all the colour had drained from his\nface, so she kept talking, thinking that it would be easier if he didn\u2019t\nrespond. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be involved, it was one night, it doesn\u2019t have to\nruin your entire life.\u201d</p><p>The colour\nreturned to his face, \u201cGood.\u201d He said flatly \u201cdon\u2019t be hitting me up for child\nsupport in 5 years when you\u2019re broke and alone\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\ndo that\u201d she said quietly</p><p>\u201cNo,\nbecause you\u2019ll have that rich boy toy over there to pay you to go down on him\u201d\nwith that Harry stood up and made his way over to the table, nostrils flaring.\nHe grabbed her hand and helped her up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\ndare talk to her like that\u201d he said quietly, trying not to make a scene \u201cthis\nis your loss mate, not hers. Don\u2019t expect to be hearing from either of us\nagain, next time you need work, I won\u2019t be helping you out\u201d</p><p>They both\nleft the caf\u00e9 and walked straight to Harry\u2019s car, neither of them spoke a word\nto each other, for the entirety of the car trip, it took until they made it\nback inside the flat for someone to open their mouth.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nPoppy said, closing the door behind her</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nbelieve I have to pay the knob\u201d he said shaking his head</p><p>***</p><p>May 5<sup>th</sup> 2017</p><p>Harry\nstayed by Poppy\u2019s side for the next few days, leaving her only once to go home\nand get some clean clothes. She knew this wouldn\u2019t last though, his album came\nout in a week and he had a week-long residency on The Late Late Show, which\nmeant he would need to be in L.A.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s\nhead hovered over the toilet bowl, staring at what was once \u00a0the contents\nof her stomach, taking deep breaths hoping that she wouldn\u2019t vomit again. Harry\nstood outside the door, waiting for her to come out, he heard the toilet flush\nand she opened the door, looking pale and sweaty.</p><p>\u201cPoppy, I\nknow this is just morning sickness, but I really think you need to make a\ndoctor\u2019s appointment, make sure everything\u2019s ok with you and the baby\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared\nH\u201d</p><p>He looked\nat her, a look of concern on his face \u201cI\u2019ll come with you\u201d he reached his hands\nout and brought her in for a hug \u201cI\u2019ll even book the appointment for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine\u201d she\nsaid, pulling away from the hug and rushing back to the bathroom, slamming the\ndoor behind her</p><p>Harry\nbooked the appointment for that afternoon, because he knew they were both free.\nSince finding out she was pregnant Poppy decided to drop her work load to 4\ndays a week, but she\u2019d promised big boss Ben that\u2019d she\u2019d always be within\nreach and doing what needed to be done from home. </p><p>Poppy was\nno stranger to doctor\u2019s offices, having an array of minor medical issues her\nentire life, she\u2019d spent her fair share of time in doctors waiting rooms, but\nthey still made her nervous. Harry sat next her, trying to calm her down by\npointing out the ridiculous articles in the tabloid magazines that littered the\ntable next to him.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\nThomas\u201d the doctor walked out of his office. They both stood and walked towards\nhim, taking their seats again once they were in his office. Poppy has been\nseeing the same doctor since she moved to the UK, so he understood most of her\nmedical history pretty well, but not as well as her doctor back in Australia.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I\ndo for you today Poppy\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\npregnant\u201d she said without hesitation, it had been a week since she found out\nand it finally felt real</p><p>\u201cCongratulations\u201d\nthe doctor nodded \u201cThis must be Dad then?\u201d he said looking at Harry. They both\nlooked at each other and laughed</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Poppy\nsaid, \u201cDad\u2019s not in the picture, Harry\u2019s just here for support, he\u2019s a strong\ncontender for God Father\u201d</p><p>The doctor\nlaughed \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re successful then\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready been offered the position\u201d Harry laughed with him</p><p>\u201cWonderful\u201d\nthe doctor said turning towards Poppy \u201cNow Poppy, we\u2019ll need to do some blood\nwork to confirm, but with your condition we\u2019ll need to keep a close eye on you\nin the first 12 weeks, pregnancies like these are considered high risk, so I\u2019d\nlike to get you in for a scan with the early pregnancy unit, as soon as we\ncan.\u201d She nodded along, grabbing onto Harry\u2019s hand \u201cWhen was your last period?\u201d</p><p>She thought\nback to before the release party \u201caround St Patrick Day\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when\ndid you last have sex?\u201d She felt Harry\u2019s grip tighten on her hand </p><p>\u201cApril 7<sup>th</sup>\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat puts\nyou at roughly four weeks pregnant, and the earliest you can have a scan is 6\nweeks, so we\u2019ll schedule that in for two weeks\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds\ngood\u201d she nodded nervously</p><p>\u201cIn the\nmeantime, I don\u2019t want you to worry about this, just take it easy, and you need\nto be taking prenatal vitamins\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat I wanted to ask, which brand is best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nkeep up with brands, but I recommend any that are high in folic acid and, in\nyour case, with your history of Thyroid trouble, I would suggest one that is\nhigh in iodine as well.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nturned to Harry, who had his phone out writing down what the doctor just said,\n\u201cDid you get that H?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he\nsqueezed her hand</p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d,\nthe doctor said, \u201cthat\u2019s about all I can do this visit, come back in a few days\nonce we get the blood work back and we\u2019ll go through everything again\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nboth you and Harry said in unison, standing up to leave. She left the room and\nwaited another ten minutes for the nurse to call her in for her blood test.\nAfter that, they left the doctors surgery, full of anxiety about the pregnancy.\nPoppy knew that getting pregnant would be hard, but she\u2019d always assumed that\nif it happened, it would be like any other. For the rest of the afternoon,\nHarry remained close to her, not directly asking her about what the doctor had\nsaid, but making sure that she was ok.</p></p>",

Shit.</p><p>This isn\u2019t\nat all how Poppy imagined this moment, she was supposed to be married, and\nhappy and living close to her family, and financially stable enough to take at\nleast two years off work, so that she could be a mum. Instead, she was single,\nmiserable and living on the opposite side of the world to her family. The only\nthings keeping her sane were her job and Harry.</p><p>She was\ncertain that it would come back negative, she\u2019d known her entire adult life\nthat getting pregnant would be almost impossible because of her condition and\nhere she was, standing in the bathroom of her London flat, staring at a\npositive pregnancy test and she didn\u2019t know how to feel. There was no way she\ncould raise a baby on her own, but this was everything she\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>Poppy\ncouldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been so stupid; how could she have forgotten the condom\nthat night with Danny? She wasn\u2019t on the pill, she wasn\u2019t supposed to be able\nto have children, but she always, always, used condoms. How could she have\nforgotten? She was drunk, and the thought never even crossed her mind, but\nChrist, how could she have been so stupid?</p><p>Again, two\npink blue lines. She was pregnant.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Herr hands\nmoved towards her stomach and the tears began streaming down her face. She\ndidn\u2019t know what to do next, no one ever tells you what to do next.</p><p>She leant\nher back against the counter, and slid down, resting her elbows on her knees\nand covered her eyes with her hands, she let herself go. Tears ran down her\ncheeks for what felt like hours and after letting herself cry for a while, she\nstood up and washed her face, drying her eyes and looking at herself in the\nmirror.</p><p>\u201cYou have\nto be strong Poppy Marie\u201d she said to herself \u201cYou\u2019re a mum now, you can\u2019t\nbreak like this.\u201d</p><p>She walked\nout of the bathroom, and into the kitchen, putting the kettle on to make a cup\nof tea while she searched for her phone. She found it under the magazine she\nwas reading before she remembered that her period was late, and she dialled\nHarry\u2019s number with no answer which made her throw her phone down on the\ncounter, before pouring herself a tea. She sat down on the couch tea in hand\nand tried Harry again, and received the same pre-recorded voice message.\nSighing loudly, she tried again, this time she left \u00a0a voice message.</p><p>\u201cChrist\nHarry, you\u2019re the most sought-after man in the world right now and you won\u2019t\npick up your bloody phone when I need you\u201d frustration was evident in her voice\n\u201cCall me as soon as you get this please, I need you.\u201d</p><p>A few hours\npast and there was still no word from Harry. She knew that he had meetings all\nday, and a rehearsal tonight, but she figured that he would have a chance to\ncheck his phone at least once throughout the afternoon. None of this felt real\nto right now, she needed to talk to someone, to tell them, before she could believe\nit herself.</p><p>The pasta\nwas boiling over and she was about to burn the sauce when her phone buzzed,\nshowing Harry\u2019s face on the screen.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d she\nanswered, stress and frustration evident in her voice</p><p>\u201cHey,\nsorry, I just got your message, everything ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, maybe,\nI don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiiight\u201d\nhe said confused \u201cWhat\u2019s going on Pop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot, I\nneed to tell you something\u201d she turned the stove off and frowned at her burnt\ndinner</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all\nears\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you\ncome over? Or are you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just\nfinished for the day, I\u2019m on my way\u201d she could hear him walking towards his car</p><p>\u201cCan you\nbring food?\u201d</p><p>She heard\nhim giggle through the phone \u201cSure, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmmm\u201d she\nlooked at the meal she had attempted to cook for herself \u201canything but pasta\u201d</p><p>\u201cWagamamas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\nthe usual pleaseee\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll\nsee you soon\u201d she heard him open his car door</p><p>\u201cByeeeeee\u201d\nshe said into the phone before she hung up.</p><p>***</p><p>Poppy was\nsitting on a stool at her kitchen bench, staring into blank space, with her\nhand on her belly. There couldn\u2019t be a baby in there, could there? It was still\nso flat, there was not even the slightest indication that she was growing a\ntiny human inside of her, besides her late period. The doorbell rang,\nsignalling Harry\u2019s arrival, and tearing her out of her trance.</p><p>\u201c \u2018s open\u201d\nshe yelled, still not bothered to move from her chair</p><p>\u201cHands are\nfull love, can you let me in?\u201d</p><p>She rolled\nher eyes and dragged herself over to the door, opening it and immediately\nheading back to her spot.</p><p>\u201cWell hello\nto you too\u201d Harry said, walking in with a box full of food</p><p>\u201cYeah Hi\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s\ngrumpy\u201d he put the box on her counter and opened her cupboard, grabbing out two\nplates</p><p>\u201cI burnt my\ndinner\u201d she sighed, taking out the cutlery and handing him a set</p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d he\nnodded \u201cSo you\u2019re hangry\u201d</p><p>Spooning\nthe food into her plate, Poppy tried her best to act like hunger is all that\nwas bothering her , but Harry saw straight through her.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed\npretty upset in your voice message love, what was bothering you\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na deep breath and put her fork down, wiping her face with a napkin \u201cI\u2019m\u2026.\u201d She\nfroze, staring into blank space again.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\u201d\nHarry put his fork down too, moving his chair closer to her and placing his\nhand over hers \u201cwhatever it is love, you can tell me\u201d</p><p>She knew\nthat, he\u2019s been there for her since the day they met, he\u2019s the only person she\ntrusts enough to tell, but she just couldn\u2019t get the words out. She took a deep\nbreath, holding in the tears \u201cHarry\u201d she said, still not making eye contact\nwith him \u201cI\u2019m pregnant\u201d</p><p>Harry froze\nfor a moment, letting the information sink in, puffing air out through his\nlips, making them vibrate, \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that\u201d he admitted, placing his\nhand on her check \u201clook at me love,\u201d Poppy turned her face and her teary eyes\nlooked into his \u201cwe\u2019ll work this out\u201d he stood so that he could wrap his arms\naround her body letting her sob into his chest, stroking her back and hushing\nuntil she calmed down. When she pulled away from his hug, he grabbed her hand\nand took her over to the couch, sitting her down and putting his arm around her\nagain. </p><p>\u201cIs it\nDanny\u2019s?\u201d he asked tentatively, after ten minutes of silence. She nodded,\nunable to form words. \u201cWhat do you want to do Pop? You\u2019ve got a choice here\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nkeeping it Harry\u201d she said, a little offended that he would even suggest the\nalternative, knowing how much she always wanted this.</p><p>\u201cWell then\ncongratulations is in order\u201d he rubbed his hand up and down her shoulder trying\nto comfort her \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a mum Poppy, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve always wanted\u201d</p><p>A smile\nstretched across her face, hearing Harry say it finally made it feel real,\nplacing her hand on her lower belly she repeated what Harry just said \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to be a mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter\nmake me god father\u201d Harry said, placing his hand over hers</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t\nthink of someone better H\u201d letting out a deep sigh, she hopped up off the couch\nand grabbed both their plates off the counter, \u201cMumma\u2019s gotta eat\u201d she giggled.</p><p>They spent\nthe next few hours talking about the baby and Harry\u2019s plans for the next few\nmonths. The meetings he had today were about his tour that he was about to\nannounce. His album comes out in a few weeks and his schedule was hectic for\nthe rest of the year, but he assured her that he would be there for her, for\nthe entire pregnancy, he was going to be away, but for no longer than a month\nat a time and he would always be just a phone call away.</p><p>It was\ngetting late and Poppy\u2019s eyes were getting heavy when Harry got up started to\nclean up after dinner. \u201cStay here tonight H?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t\nwant to stay anywhere else\u201d he said looking at the still full box of food \u201cI\nmay have ordered too much\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\nIt won\u2019t go to waste\u201d she said, putting the containers in the fridge.</p><p>Once all\nthe food was away and their plates were in the dishwasher, Poppy started to get\nready for bed, taking a shower and cleaning her teeth while Harry searched her\nroom for the spare boxers he kept in the flat for nights like these when he\nstayed without planning on it. There wasn\u2019t much room in the flat, so whenever\nHarry stayed they shared a bed, he was too tall for the couch and there was no\nway he was sleeping on the floor. As they both got into bed, Harry looked at\nher sternly. \u201cYou have to tell him you know\u201d he said, referring to Danny.</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d\nPoppy sighed \u201cI don\u2019t want him involved though\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a\ngood guy Pop\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\nget that vibe\u201d she confessed \u201cHe was kind of a dick\u201d</p><p>Harry\nturned his head on the pillow to look at her \u201cI know this is none of my\nbusiness, but did you use a condom?\u201d</p><p>She shook\nher head \u201cIt was over so quickly, the thought never even crossed my mind\u201d she\nreached over to switch the lamp off \u201cdude didn\u2019t even last a minute\u201d</p><p>Harry let a\nslight chuckle \u201cHe still deserves to know\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\nbut I\u2019m going to need his number\u201d she laughed</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know\nthat I have it\u201d Harry admitted, \u201cBut we\u2019ll get it somehow\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\npredicted the future H\u201d she said, through a yawn</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou mean?\u201d he asked, confused</p><p>\u201cKiwi.\u201d</p><p>He laughed,\n\u201cI guess I did\u201d he said through laughter \u201cI\u2019m sorry love\u201d</p><p>They both\ngiggled together at the irony of the situation, making jokes about the song and\nDanny.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no\nway you were working your way through a cheap pack of cigarettes that night\u201d he\ngiggled</p><p>\u201cI might\nhave been, you were too busy with Ali to notice\u201d</p><p>He grabbed\nthe pillow out from under his head, playfully hitting her torso with it \u201cexcuse\nme, it was my launch party, I should have been the one getting laid that night\u201d</p><p>Poppy\ngasped sarcastically, \u201cI stole your thunder\u201d she giggled</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE\nHAVING HIS BABY\u201d he sang at the top of his lungs to the tune of kiwi, laughing\nas he sang.</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S NONE\nOF HIS BUSINESS\u201d she joined him, not sounding nearly as good as he did, but it\nhelped, there was something about lying next to harry, screaming at the top of\nher lungs, that made all the stress and worry go away, even if it was just for\nfive minutes.</p><p>Eventually,\nthey both drifted off to sleep, calling it a night after singing Kiwi for the\nthird time. When they woke up the next morning, her throat was scratchy from\nall the screaming and she felt a little nauseous, she wasn\u2019t sure if it was\nmorning sickness or nerves, but there was no way she could keep any food down.</p><p>The next\nmorning, Harry tracked down Danny\u2019s number for you and Poppy sent him a text:</p><p><i>\u201cHi Danny,\nit\u2019s Poppy from a couple of weeks ago, you probably don\u2019t remember me, but I\nneed to talk to you, coffee at 10? </i></p><p>Ten anxious\nminutes later, her phone buzzed on the coffee table with a reply </p><p><i>\u201cI remember\nyou Poppy, couldn\u2019t stay away huh? 10am at coffee lab?\u201d</i></p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes and threw her phone to Harry when she read his reply \u201cWhy did\nyou ever set me up with this knobhead H?</p><p>\u201cChrist\u201d he\nsighed \u201cMaybe stop taking my advice yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit\nlate for that now, come with me? I don\u2019t think I can do this alone\u201d</p><p>He nodded,\nbiting into his banana, \u201cI\u2019ll come with, but I\u2019ll sit at another table until\nyou need me\u201d</p><p>She agreed\nthat it would be weird for Harry to tell him with her , but she definitely\nneeded the support, she didn\u2019t know how to tell him that she was pregnant with\nhis child and she certainly didn\u2019t know how to tell him that she didn\u2019t want or\nneed him to have anything to do with it.</p><p>Poppy got\nready slowly that morning, trying her best to post pone the inevitable. It was\nten to ten by the time she was ready to leave the house and it was a\ntwenty-minute drive to Coffee Lab, so she was running late and she\u2019d hoped that\nDanny had somewhere to be by 11 so the meeting would be short and sweet. Or not\nso sweet, but definitely short.</p><p>Poppy and\nHarry walked in the door, side by side, and spotted Danny immediately. Harry\nducked away and sat at the empty table a few feet away from Poppy, still within\nearshot, if she needed him.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d she\nsaid shyly as she sat down opposite Danny. He leant across the table and placed\na kiss on her cheek. She shied away from the kiss and overheard Harry scoffing\nat his table, clearly annoyed by Danny\u2019s to greeting. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good\nto see you again Poppy, surprised you stayed away this long\u201d he said\nconfidently, and she laughed nervously \u201cI ordered you a cappuccino, hope that\u2019s\nok\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\ndrink coffee, but that\u2019s ok\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d he\nsaid, taken a back, \u201cSorry. So why did you need to see me urgently?\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na deep breath and tried to transport herself back to last night, when she was\ntelling Harry. She was nervous then, but nothing like this. She looked over at\nHarry, who was watching her, waiting for his cue. \u201cDanny\u201d she breathed \u201cI\u2019m\npregnant.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything but, all the colour had drained from his\nface, so she kept talking, thinking that it would be easier if he didn\u2019t\nrespond. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be involved, it was one night, it doesn\u2019t have to\nruin your entire life.\u201d</p><p>The colour\nreturned to his face, \u201cGood.\u201d He said flatly \u201cdon\u2019t be hitting me up for child\nsupport in 5 years when you\u2019re broke and alone\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\ndo that\u201d she said quietly</p><p>\u201cNo,\nbecause you\u2019ll have that rich boy toy over there to pay you to go down on him\u201d\nwith that Harry stood up and made his way over to the table, nostrils flaring.\nHe grabbed her hand and helped her up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\ndare talk to her like that\u201d he said quietly, trying not to make a scene \u201cthis\nis your loss mate, not hers. Don\u2019t expect to be hearing from either of us\nagain, next time you need work, I won\u2019t be helping you out\u201d</p><p>They both\nleft the caf\u00e9 and walked straight to Harry\u2019s car, neither of them spoke a word\nto each other, for the entirety of the car trip, it took until they made it\nback inside the flat for someone to open their mouth.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nPoppy said, closing the door behind her</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nbelieve I have to pay the knob\u201d he said shaking his head</p><p>***</p><p>May 5<sup>th</sup> 2017</p><p>Harry\nstayed by Poppy\u2019s side for the next few days, leaving her only once to go home\nand get some clean clothes. She knew this wouldn\u2019t last though, his album came\nout in a week and he had a week-long residency on The Late Late Show, which\nmeant he would need to be in L.A.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s\nhead hovered over the toilet bowl, staring at what was once \u00a0the contents\nof her stomach, taking deep breaths hoping that she wouldn\u2019t vomit again. Harry\nstood outside the door, waiting for her to come out, he heard the toilet flush\nand she opened the door, looking pale and sweaty.</p><p>\u201cPoppy, I\nknow this is just morning sickness, but I really think you need to make a\ndoctor\u2019s appointment, make sure everything\u2019s ok with you and the baby\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared\nH\u201d</p><p>He looked\nat her, a look of concern on his face \u201cI\u2019ll come with you\u201d he reached his hands\nout and brought her in for a hug \u201cI\u2019ll even book the appointment for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine\u201d she\nsaid, pulling away from the hug and rushing back to the bathroom, slamming the\ndoor behind her</p><p>Harry\nbooked the appointment for that afternoon, because he knew they were both free.\nSince finding out she was pregnant Poppy decided to drop her work load to 4\ndays a week, but she\u2019d promised big boss Ben that\u2019d she\u2019d always be within\nreach and doing what needed to be done from home. </p><p>Poppy was\nno stranger to doctor\u2019s offices, having an array of minor medical issues her\nentire life, she\u2019d spent her fair share of time in doctors waiting rooms, but\nthey still made her nervous. Harry sat next her, trying to calm her down by\npointing out the ridiculous articles in the tabloid magazines that littered the\ntable next to him.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\nThomas\u201d the doctor walked out of his office. They both stood and walked towards\nhim, taking their seats again once they were in his office. Poppy has been\nseeing the same doctor since she moved to the UK, so he understood most of her\nmedical history pretty well, but not as well as her doctor back in Australia.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I\ndo for you today Poppy\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\npregnant\u201d she said without hesitation, it had been a week since she found out\nand it finally felt real</p><p>\u201cCongratulations\u201d\nthe doctor nodded \u201cThis must be Dad then?\u201d he said looking at Harry. They both\nlooked at each other and laughed</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Poppy\nsaid, \u201cDad\u2019s not in the picture, Harry\u2019s just here for support, he\u2019s a strong\ncontender for God Father\u201d</p><p>The doctor\nlaughed \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re successful then\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready been offered the position\u201d Harry laughed with him</p><p>\u201cWonderful\u201d\nthe doctor said turning towards Poppy \u201cNow Poppy, we\u2019ll need to do some blood\nwork to confirm, but with your condition we\u2019ll need to keep a close eye on you\nin the first 12 weeks, pregnancies like these are considered high risk, so I\u2019d\nlike to get you in for a scan with the early pregnancy unit, as soon as we\ncan.\u201d She nodded along, grabbing onto Harry\u2019s hand \u201cWhen was your last period?\u201d</p><p>She thought\nback to before the release party \u201caround St Patrick Day\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when\ndid you last have sex?\u201d She felt Harry\u2019s grip tighten on her hand </p><p>\u201cApril 7<sup>th</sup>\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat puts\nyou at roughly four weeks pregnant, and the earliest you can have a scan is 6\nweeks, so we\u2019ll schedule that in for two weeks\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds\ngood\u201d she nodded nervously</p><p>\u201cIn the\nmeantime, I don\u2019t want you to worry about this, just take it easy, and you need\nto be taking prenatal vitamins\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat I wanted to ask, which brand is best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nkeep up with brands, but I recommend any that are high in folic acid and, in\nyour case, with your history of Thyroid trouble, I would suggest one that is\nhigh in iodine as well.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nturned to Harry, who had his phone out writing down what the doctor just said,\n\u201cDid you get that H?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he\nsqueezed her hand</p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d,\nthe doctor said, \u201cthat\u2019s about all I can do this visit, come back in a few days\nonce we get the blood work back and we\u2019ll go through everything again\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nboth you and Harry said in unison, standing up to leave. She left the room and\nwaited another ten minutes for the nurse to call her in for her blood test.\nAfter that, they left the doctors surgery, full of anxiety about the pregnancy.\nPoppy knew that getting pregnant would be hard, but she\u2019d always assumed that\nif it happened, it would be like any other. For the rest of the afternoon,\nHarry remained close to her, not directly asking her about what the doctor had\nsaid, but making sure that she was ok.</p></p>",

Shit.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t\nat all how Poppy imagined this moment, she was supposed to be married, and\nhappy and living close to her family, and financially stable enough to take at\nleast two years off work, so that she could be a mum. Instead, she was single,\nmiserable and living on the opposite side of the world to her family. The only\nthings keeping her sane were her job and Harry.</p><p>She was\ncertain that it would come back negative, she&rsquo;d known her entire adult life\nthat getting pregnant would be almost impossible because of her condition and\nhere she was, standing in the bathroom of her London flat, staring at a\npositive pregnancy test and she didn&rsquo;t know how to feel. There was no way she\ncould raise a baby on her own, but this was everything she&rsquo;d ever wanted.</p><p>Poppy\ncouldn&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d been so stupid; how could she have forgotten the condom\nthat night with Danny? She wasn&rsquo;t on the pill, she wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be able\nto have children, but she always, always, used condoms. How could she have\nforgotten? She was drunk, and the thought never even crossed her mind, but\nChrist, how could she have been so stupid?</p><p>Again, two\npink blue lines. She was pregnant.</p><p>Herr hands\nmoved towards her stomach and the tears began streaming down her face. She\ndidn&rsquo;t know what to do next, no one ever tells you what to do next.</p><p>She leant\nher back against the counter, and slid down, resting her elbows on her knees\nand covered her eyes with her hands, she let herself go. Tears ran down her\ncheeks for what felt like hours and after letting herself cry for a while, she\nstood up and washed her face, drying her eyes and looking at herself in the\nmirror.</p><p>&ldquo;You have\nto be strong Poppy Marie&rdquo; she said to herself &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mum now, you can&rsquo;t\nbreak like this.&rdquo;</p><p>She walked\nout of the bathroom, and into the kitchen, putting the kettle on to make a cup\nof tea while she searched for her phone. She found it under the magazine she\nwas reading before she remembered that her period was late, and she dialled\nHarry&rsquo;s number with no answer which made her throw her phone down on the\ncounter, before pouring herself a tea. She sat down on the couch tea in hand\nand tried Harry again, and received the same pre-recorded voice message.\nSighing loudly, she tried again, this time she left &nbsp;a voice message.</p><p>&ldquo;Christ\nHarry, you&rsquo;re the most sought-after man in the world right now and you won&rsquo;t\npick up your bloody phone when I need you&rdquo; frustration was evident in her voice\n&ldquo;Call me as soon as you get this please, I need you.&rdquo;</p><p>A few hours\npast and there was still no word from Harry. She knew that he had meetings all\nday, and a rehearsal tonight, but she figured that he would have a chance to\ncheck his phone at least once throughout the afternoon. None of this felt real\nto right now, she needed to talk to someone, to tell them, before she could believe\nit herself.</p><p>The pasta\nwas boiling over and she was about to burn the sauce when her phone buzzed,\nshowing Harry&rsquo;s face on the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; she\nanswered, stress and frustration evident in her voice</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nsorry, I just got your message, everything ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, maybe,\nI don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Riiight&rdquo;\nhe said confused &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on Pop?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A lot, I\nneed to tell you something&rdquo; she turned the stove off and frowned at her burnt\ndinner</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all\nears&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you\ncome over? Or are you busy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just\nfinished for the day, I&rsquo;m on my way&rdquo; she could hear him walking towards his car</p><p>&ldquo;Can you\nbring food?&rdquo;</p><p>She heard\nhim giggle through the phone &ldquo;Sure, what do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ummmm&rdquo; she\nlooked at the meal she had attempted to cook for herself &ldquo;anything but pasta&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wagamamas?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect,\nthe usual pleaseee&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll\nsee you soon&rdquo; she heard him open his car door</p><p>&ldquo;Byeeeeee&rdquo;\nshe said into the phone before she hung up.</p><p>***</p><p>Poppy was\nsitting on a stool at her kitchen bench, staring into blank space, with her\nhand on her belly. There couldn&rsquo;t be a baby in there, could there? It was still\nso flat, there was not even the slightest indication that she was growing a\ntiny human inside of her, besides her late period. The doorbell rang,\nsignalling Harry&rsquo;s arrival, and tearing her out of her trance.</p><p>&ldquo; &lsquo;s open&rdquo;\nshe yelled, still not bothered to move from her chair</p><p>&ldquo;Hands are\nfull love, can you let me in?&rdquo;</p><p>She rolled\nher eyes and dragged herself over to the door, opening it and immediately\nheading back to her spot.</p><p>&ldquo;Well hello\nto you too&rdquo; Harry said, walking in with a box full of food</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Hi&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s\ngrumpy&rdquo; he put the box on her counter and opened her cupboard, grabbing out two\nplates</p><p>&ldquo;I burnt my\ndinner&rdquo; she sighed, taking out the cutlery and handing him a set</p><p>&ldquo;Ahh&rdquo; he\nnodded &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re hangry&rdquo;</p><p>Spooning\nthe food into her plate, Poppy tried her best to act like hunger is all that\nwas bothering her , but Harry saw straight through her.</p><p>&ldquo;You seemed\npretty upset in your voice message love, what was bothering you&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy took\na deep breath and put her fork down, wiping her face with a napkin &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;.&rdquo; She\nfroze, staring into blank space again.</p><p>&ldquo;Poppy&rdquo;\nHarry put his fork down too, moving his chair closer to her and placing his\nhand over hers &ldquo;whatever it is love, you can tell me&rdquo;</p><p>She knew\nthat, he&rsquo;s been there for her since the day they met, he&rsquo;s the only person she\ntrusts enough to tell, but she just couldn&rsquo;t get the words out. She took a deep\nbreath, holding in the tears &ldquo;Harry&rdquo; she said, still not making eye contact\nwith him &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant&rdquo;</p><p>Harry froze\nfor a moment, letting the information sink in, puffing air out through his\nlips, making them vibrate, &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t expecting that&rdquo; he admitted, placing his\nhand on her check &ldquo;look at me love,&rdquo; Poppy turned her face and her teary eyes\nlooked into his &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll work this out&rdquo; he stood so that he could wrap his arms\naround her body letting her sob into his chest, stroking her back and hushing\nuntil she calmed down. When she pulled away from his hug, he grabbed her hand\nand took her over to the couch, sitting her down and putting his arm around her\nagain. </p><p>&ldquo;Is it\nDanny&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he asked tentatively, after ten minutes of silence. She nodded,\nunable to form words. &ldquo;What do you want to do Pop? You&rsquo;ve got a choice here&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nkeeping it Harry&rdquo; she said, a little offended that he would even suggest the\nalternative, knowing how much she always wanted this.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then\ncongratulations is in order&rdquo; he rubbed his hand up and down her shoulder trying\nto comfort her &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be a mum Poppy, it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve always wanted&rdquo;</p><p>A smile\nstretched across her face, hearing Harry say it finally made it feel real,\nplacing her hand on her lower belly she repeated what Harry just said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngoing to be a mum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Better\nmake me god father&rdquo; Harry said, placing his hand over hers</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t\nthink of someone better H&rdquo; letting out a deep sigh, she hopped up off the couch\nand grabbed both their plates off the counter, &ldquo;Mumma&rsquo;s gotta eat&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>They spent\nthe next few hours talking about the baby and Harry&rsquo;s plans for the next few\nmonths. The meetings he had today were about his tour that he was about to\nannounce. His album comes out in a few weeks and his schedule was hectic for\nthe rest of the year, but he assured her that he would be there for her, for\nthe entire pregnancy, he was going to be away, but for no longer than a month\nat a time and he would always be just a phone call away.</p><p>It was\ngetting late and Poppy&rsquo;s eyes were getting heavy when Harry got up started to\nclean up after dinner. &ldquo;Stay here tonight H?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t\nwant to stay anywhere else&rdquo; he said looking at the still full box of food &ldquo;I\nmay have ordered too much&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ok,\nIt won&rsquo;t go to waste&rdquo; she said, putting the containers in the fridge.</p><p>Once all\nthe food was away and their plates were in the dishwasher, Poppy started to get\nready for bed, taking a shower and cleaning her teeth while Harry searched her\nroom for the spare boxers he kept in the flat for nights like these when he\nstayed without planning on it. There wasn&rsquo;t much room in the flat, so whenever\nHarry stayed they shared a bed, he was too tall for the couch and there was no\nway he was sleeping on the floor. As they both got into bed, Harry looked at\nher sternly. &ldquo;You have to tell him you know&rdquo; he said, referring to Danny.</p><p>&ldquo;I know&rdquo;\nPoppy sighed &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him involved though&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a\ngood guy Pop&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t\nget that vibe&rdquo; she confessed &ldquo;He was kind of a dick&rdquo;</p><p>Harry\nturned his head on the pillow to look at her &ldquo;I know this is none of my\nbusiness, but did you use a condom?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook\nher head &ldquo;It was over so quickly, the thought never even crossed my mind&rdquo; she\nreached over to switch the lamp off &ldquo;dude didn&rsquo;t even last a minute&rdquo;</p><p>Harry let a\nslight chuckle &ldquo;He still deserves to know&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,\nbut I&rsquo;m going to need his number&rdquo; she laughed</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know\nthat I have it&rdquo; Harry admitted, &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll get it somehow&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\npredicted the future H&rdquo; she said, through a yawn</p><p>&ldquo;What do\nyou mean?&rdquo; he asked, confused</p><p>&ldquo;Kiwi.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed,\n&ldquo;I guess I did&rdquo; he said through laughter &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry love&rdquo;</p><p>They both\ngiggled together at the irony of the situation, making jokes about the song and\nDanny.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no\nway you were working your way through a cheap pack of cigarettes that night&rdquo; he\ngiggled</p><p>&ldquo;I might\nhave been, you were too busy with Ali to notice&rdquo;</p><p>He grabbed\nthe pillow out from under his head, playfully hitting her torso with it &ldquo;excuse\nme, it was my launch party, I should have been the one getting laid that night&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\ngasped sarcastically, &ldquo;I stole your thunder&rdquo; she giggled</p><p>&ldquo;YOU&rsquo;RE\nHAVING HIS BABY&rdquo; he sang at the top of his lungs to the tune of kiwi, laughing\nas he sang.</p><p>&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S NONE\nOF HIS BUSINESS&rdquo; she joined him, not sounding nearly as good as he did, but it\nhelped, there was something about lying next to harry, screaming at the top of\nher lungs, that made all the stress and worry go away, even if it was just for\nfive minutes.</p><p>Eventually,\nthey both drifted off to sleep, calling it a night after singing Kiwi for the\nthird time. When they woke up the next morning, her throat was scratchy from\nall the screaming and she felt a little nauseous, she wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was\nmorning sickness or nerves, but there was no way she could keep any food down.</p><p>The next\nmorning, Harry tracked down Danny&rsquo;s number for you and Poppy sent him a text:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hi Danny,\nit&rsquo;s Poppy from a couple of weeks ago, you probably don&rsquo;t remember me, but I\nneed to talk to you, coffee at 10? </i></p><p>Ten anxious\nminutes later, her phone buzzed on the coffee table with a reply </p><p><i>&ldquo;I remember\nyou Poppy, couldn&rsquo;t stay away huh? 10am at coffee lab?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes and threw her phone to Harry when she read his reply &ldquo;Why did\nyou ever set me up with this knobhead H?</p><p>&ldquo;Christ&rdquo; he\nsighed &ldquo;Maybe stop taking my advice yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit\nlate for that now, come with me? I don&rsquo;t think I can do this alone&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded,\nbiting into his banana, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with, but I&rsquo;ll sit at another table until\nyou need me&rdquo;</p><p>She agreed\nthat it would be weird for Harry to tell him with her , but she definitely\nneeded the support, she didn&rsquo;t know how to tell him that she was pregnant with\nhis child and she certainly didn&rsquo;t know how to tell him that she didn&rsquo;t want or\nneed him to have anything to do with it.</p><p>Poppy got\nready slowly that morning, trying her best to post pone the inevitable. It was\nten to ten by the time she was ready to leave the house and it was a\ntwenty-minute drive to Coffee Lab, so she was running late and she&rsquo;d hoped that\nDanny had somewhere to be by 11 so the meeting would be short and sweet. Or not\nso sweet, but definitely short.</p><p>Poppy and\nHarry walked in the door, side by side, and spotted Danny immediately. Harry\nducked away and sat at the empty table a few feet away from Poppy, still within\nearshot, if she needed him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; she\nsaid shyly as she sat down opposite Danny. He leant across the table and placed\na kiss on her cheek. She shied away from the kiss and overheard Harry scoffing\nat his table, clearly annoyed by Danny&rsquo;s to greeting. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good\nto see you again Poppy, surprised you stayed away this long&rdquo; he said\nconfidently, and she laughed nervously &ldquo;I ordered you a cappuccino, hope that&rsquo;s\nok&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\ndrink coffee, but that&rsquo;s ok&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; he\nsaid, taken a back, &ldquo;Sorry. So why did you need to see me urgently?&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy took\na deep breath and tried to transport herself back to last night, when she was\ntelling Harry. She was nervous then, but nothing like this. She looked over at\nHarry, who was watching her, waiting for his cue. &ldquo;Danny&rdquo; she breathed &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\npregnant.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say anything but, all the colour had drained from his\nface, so she kept talking, thinking that it would be easier if he didn&rsquo;t\nrespond. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to be involved, it was one night, it doesn&rsquo;t have to\nruin your entire life.&rdquo;</p><p>The colour\nreturned to his face, &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He said flatly &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be hitting me up for child\nsupport in 5 years when you&rsquo;re broke and alone&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t\ndo that&rdquo; she said quietly</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nbecause you&rsquo;ll have that rich boy toy over there to pay you to go down on him&rdquo;\nwith that Harry stood up and made his way over to the table, nostrils flaring.\nHe grabbed her hand and helped her up.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you\ndare talk to her like that&rdquo; he said quietly, trying not to make a scene &ldquo;this\nis your loss mate, not hers. Don&rsquo;t expect to be hearing from either of us\nagain, next time you need work, I won&rsquo;t be helping you out&rdquo;</p><p>They both\nleft the caf&eacute; and walked straight to Harry&rsquo;s car, neither of them spoke a word\nto each other, for the entirety of the car trip, it took until they made it\nback inside the flat for someone to open their mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;\nPoppy said, closing the door behind her</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t\nbelieve I have to pay the knob&rdquo; he said shaking his head</p><p>***</p><p>May 5<sup>th</sup> 2017</p><p>Harry\nstayed by Poppy&rsquo;s side for the next few days, leaving her only once to go home\nand get some clean clothes. She knew this wouldn&rsquo;t last though, his album came\nout in a week and he had a week-long residency on The Late Late Show, which\nmeant he would need to be in L.A.</p><p>Poppy&rsquo;s\nhead hovered over the toilet bowl, staring at what was once &nbsp;the contents\nof her stomach, taking deep breaths hoping that she wouldn&rsquo;t vomit again. Harry\nstood outside the door, waiting for her to come out, he heard the toilet flush\nand she opened the door, looking pale and sweaty.</p><p>&ldquo;Poppy, I\nknow this is just morning sickness, but I really think you need to make a\ndoctor&rsquo;s appointment, make sure everything&rsquo;s ok with you and the baby&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared\nH&rdquo;</p><p>He looked\nat her, a look of concern on his face &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you&rdquo; he reached his hands\nout and brought her in for a hug &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even book the appointment for you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine&rdquo; she\nsaid, pulling away from the hug and rushing back to the bathroom, slamming the\ndoor behind her</p><p>Harry\nbooked the appointment for that afternoon, because he knew they were both free.\nSince finding out she was pregnant Poppy decided to drop her work load to 4\ndays a week, but she&rsquo;d promised big boss Ben that&rsquo;d she&rsquo;d always be within\nreach and doing what needed to be done from home. </p><p>Poppy was\nno stranger to doctor&rsquo;s offices, having an array of minor medical issues her\nentire life, she&rsquo;d spent her fair share of time in doctors waiting rooms, but\nthey still made her nervous. Harry sat next her, trying to calm her down by\npointing out the ridiculous articles in the tabloid magazines that littered the\ntable next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Poppy\nThomas&rdquo; the doctor walked out of his office. They both stood and walked towards\nhim, taking their seats again once they were in his office. Poppy has been\nseeing the same doctor since she moved to the UK, so he understood most of her\nmedical history pretty well, but not as well as her doctor back in Australia.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I\ndo for you today Poppy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\npregnant&rdquo; she said without hesitation, it had been a week since she found out\nand it finally felt real</p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations&rdquo;\nthe doctor nodded &ldquo;This must be Dad then?&rdquo; he said looking at Harry. They both\nlooked at each other and laughed</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Poppy\nsaid, &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s not in the picture, Harry&rsquo;s just here for support, he&rsquo;s a strong\ncontender for God Father&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor\nlaughed &ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;re successful then&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nalready been offered the position&rdquo; Harry laughed with him</p><p>&ldquo;Wonderful&rdquo;\nthe doctor said turning towards Poppy &ldquo;Now Poppy, we&rsquo;ll need to do some blood\nwork to confirm, but with your condition we&rsquo;ll need to keep a close eye on you\nin the first 12 weeks, pregnancies like these are considered high risk, so I&rsquo;d\nlike to get you in for a scan with the early pregnancy unit, as soon as we\ncan.&rdquo; She nodded along, grabbing onto Harry&rsquo;s hand &ldquo;When was your last period?&rdquo;</p><p>She thought\nback to before the release party &ldquo;around St Patrick Day&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when\ndid you last have sex?&rdquo; She felt Harry&rsquo;s grip tighten on her hand </p><p>&ldquo;April 7<sup>th</sup>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That puts\nyou at roughly four weeks pregnant, and the earliest you can have a scan is 6\nweeks, so we&rsquo;ll schedule that in for two weeks&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds\ngood&rdquo; she nodded nervously</p><p>&ldquo;In the\nmeantime, I don&rsquo;t want you to worry about this, just take it easy, and you need\nto be taking prenatal vitamins&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nwhat I wanted to ask, which brand is best?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nkeep up with brands, but I recommend any that are high in folic acid and, in\nyour case, with your history of Thyroid trouble, I would suggest one that is\nhigh in iodine as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\nturned to Harry, who had his phone out writing down what the doctor just said,\n&ldquo;Did you get that H?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; he\nsqueezed her hand</p><p>&ldquo;Alright&rdquo;,\nthe doctor said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s about all I can do this visit, come back in a few days\nonce we get the blood work back and we&rsquo;ll go through everything again&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;\nboth you and Harry said in unison, standing up to leave. She left the room and\nwaited another ten minutes for the nurse to call her in for her blood test.\nAfter that, they left the doctors surgery, full of anxiety about the pregnancy.\nPoppy knew that getting pregnant would be hard, but she&rsquo;d always assumed that\nif it happened, it would be like any other. For the rest of the afternoon,\nHarry remained close to her, not directly asking her about what the doctor had\nsaid, but making sure that she was ok.</p></p>",

Shit.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t\nat all how Poppy imagined this moment, she was supposed to be married, and\nhappy and living close to her family, and financially stable enough to take at\nleast two years off work, so that she could be a mum. Instead, she was single,\nmiserable and living on the opposite side of the world to her family. The only\nthings keeping her sane were her job and Harry.</p>\n<p>She was\ncertain that it would come back negative, she&rsquo;d known her entire adult life\nthat getting pregnant would be almost impossible because of her condition and\nhere she was, standing in the bathroom of her London flat, staring at a\npositive pregnancy test and she didn&rsquo;t know how to feel. There was no way she\ncould raise a baby on her own, but this was everything she&rsquo;d ever wanted.</p>\n<p>Poppy\ncouldn&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d been so stupid; how could she have forgotten the condom\nthat night with Danny? She wasn&rsquo;t on the pill, she wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be able\nto have children, but she always, always, used condoms. How could she have\nforgotten? She was drunk, and the thought never even crossed her mind, but\nChrist, how could she have been so stupid?</p>\n<p>Again, two\npink blue lines. She was pregnant.</p>\n</p>",

After a half an hour of turning around to get into a good position of sleep, Harry spoke up hoping he could still get what he wants. </p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep\u2026 we could have sex?\u201d He sheepishly asked. </p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d you sighed. \u201cI love you, I want you, but if I don\u2019t fall asleep I\u2019ll be a monster in the morning,\u201d you said.

Everything began to remind her of him. The bells signaling a class beginning and ending made her wonder how he greets his students, was it as polite as he had greeted her? Her students that were taking his course had said he was a funny teacher. Perhaps he opened class with a joke. The lovely rose bushes at the front of the school she passed by on her way to her car now made her wonder what Harry\u2019s favorite flower was. His pretentious exterior would make her assume it\u2019s some rare flower with an extremely hard name to pronounce that grows every 20 years, but the brief glimpse she got into his true personality makes her believe it\u2019s probably a simple plant like a rose or carnation. On her way home as she passed restaurant after restaurant she wondered what his favorite food was. More than anything she wondered what restaurant would be suitable for a first date. When she got home and was greeted by her child, a small white Bolognese dog called Valentina, she wondered if harry was a dog or cat person or maybe both.

He picks up his book from the ground and says \u201cWe can go in my car.\u201d She nods and they walk out to the parking lot. </p><p>They walk past Y/N\u2019s car and harry scoffs. She confusedly asks \u201cwhat?\u201d He says \u201cThis car has been parking in my parking space for a month.\u201d Y/N, now amused by his frustration asks \u201cIs your name on it?\u201d He says \u201cNo but I\u2019ve parked here for the past 2 years.\u201d She shrugs and says \u201cThat\u2019s real life. It\u2019s not going to be happy all the time.\u201d He fake pouts at her use of his previous quotes and says \u201cOi, here I am tryna take you out for some tacos and you mock me. What a minx.\u201d She giggles and they get into his car. </p><p>Y/N breaks the silence almost immediately and asks \u201cAre you gonna chaperone the dance?\u201d Harry doesn\u2019t want to say his true opinion in fear it\u2019d conflict with hers but he doesn\u2019t want to lie and be in-genuine. He finds a middle ground and says \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Seems a little odd, ya know. Hovering over the students while they\u2019re just trying to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>Y/N moves her head in agreement and says \u201cYeah it is a little weird. At my Homecoming senior year there was only 3 teachers who chaperoned so everyone brought mini vodka bottles and grinded on each other. So I understand why they have chaperones.\u201d Harry laughs and says \u201cDid you participate in the vodka and grinding?\u201d Y/N fake scoffs and jokingly says \u201cHow dare you! I was a straight B student, I would never!\u201d They both laugh and Y/N says \u201cWanna go to homecoming with me?\u201d </p><p>Harry can\u2019t fight the huge grin and blush making their way to his face and neither can Y/N. She feels like she\u2019s back in high school and just told her crush she liked them. Harry nods and says \u201cYeah. As long as you bring the mini vodka bottles.\u201d They both smile at each other briefly and Y/N tries to contain her excitement. She gets her phone out and begins to email Mrs. Nas informing her on their desire to chaperone. </p><p>Once she\u2019s done she reads it aloud, \u201cDear Mrs. Nas, Me and Mr. Styles are interested in chaperoning this years homecoming dance. What additional information should we know prior to next Saturday\u2019s dance?\u201d Harry quickly says \u201cMr. Styles and I.\u201d Y/N corrects the error and says \u201cWhere were you to proof read all my essays?\u201d </p><p>They finally arrive at the taco shop drive thru and order their food. When they get to the window Y/N opens her phone case to pull out the $10 she always keeps in case of emergencies but Harry\u2019s already handing the worker $20. She gives Harry the $10 but he shakes his head and says \u201cS\u2019fine love. Keep it.\u201d Y/N isn\u2019t taking no for answer so as harry is focused on grabbing the bag of food from the window, Y/N puts the $10 in the middle console quickly. </p><p>She grabs the bag from him so he can continue driving and she says \u201cThank you.\u201d He says \u201cNo problem. Now what color tie should I wear?\u201d Y/N laughs and says \u201cWhatever you want. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d Harry mentally pictures his closet and says \u201cGrey blazer and trousers with a black shirt or black blazer and trousers with a pink shirt?\u201d Y/N is the last person he should come to for fashion tips. \u201cUm. I don\u2019t know I\u2019d have to see what they look like.\u201d With a sudden boost of confidence Harry says \u201cI\u2019ll send you a picture later.\u201d Y/N just nods not trusting her mouth. </p><p>On the note of fashion and clothing Y/N asks \u201cWhat are you planning on wearing for spirit week?\u201d Harry\u2019s face contorts into something Y/N can only describe as surprise and confusion. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna dress up actually.\u201d Y/N immediately inquires \u201cWhy not? If you don\u2019t have anything for some of the days I could let you borrow some stuff. You could also go to the thrift store so you don\u2019t waste money on stuff you\u2019re only gonna wear once.\u201d Harry shakes his head and says \u201cNo no. It\u2019s not that. Just seems a bit&hellip;silly.\u201d </p><p>Y/N feels a bit defensive and says \u201cIt\u2019s not silly. The way I see it is if teachers dress up it shows the students that they have spirit for the school too.\u201d Harry shrugs and says \u201cMost students don\u2019t even want to be at school. Me wearing pajamas isn\u2019t going to change that.\u201d </p><p>Y/N frowns at his pessimistic remarks. She\u2019s always been a \u2018half full\u2019 type of person. This mixed with her stubbornness made her determined to change Harry\u2019s mind. As they pull into the school parking lot she says \u201cIt\u2019s just one week. I\u2019ll help you if you need it.\u201d </p><p>He pulls into the same parking spot he left 20 minutes ago and says \u201cWhat even is Royalty Day?\u201d They get out of the car and Y/N happily answers \u201cYou get to dress up as a prince or princess.\u201d Harry grabs the bag from her hand and says \u201cHow is wearing a crown showing I have school spirit again?\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes as they walk into the school and says \u201cIt\u2019s about your intentions not what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d </p><p>She opens her classroom door and holds it open as she let\u2019s Harry in first. He puts the bag of food down on a desk and she moves two desks to face one another. They both sit and she still holds onto her argument. \u201cI still think you should dress up next week.\u201d Harry can\u2019t help but smile at her insistent determination. \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone so passionate about Pajama Day.\u201d They both laugh and she says \u201cI\u2019m extremely passionate. Don\u2019t even get me started on Twin Day.\u201d </p><p>They share a giggle as they lock eyes and Harry can\u2019t say no to her any longer. \u201cWhich celebrity should I dress up as?\u201d Y/N immediately lights up and says \u201cYou\u2019d make a great Danny DeVito.\u201d </p><p>They both laugh and enjoy the rest of lunch discussing outfit ideas and eating their tacos. The bell ringing knocks them out of the world they subconsciously created with each other. They quickly clean up and move the desks back then Harry remembers, \u201cCan I have your number? So I can show you the suits.\u201d Y/N nods and says \u201coh yeah let me write it down for you.\u201d She quickly grabs a pen and sticky note from Mrs. Meyers\u2019 desk and writes her number with a smiley face. She hands it to him and he quickly says \u201cHad a good time.\u201d And exits the classroom.</p><p>Almost immediately students start funneling in and Mrs. Meyers is only 7 minutes late to class this time. When 6th period rolls around Y/N makes sure to congratulate Julia. </p><p>The rest of class Y/N plays a French film since it\u2019s Friday. As she catches up on some of her own school work she sees her phone light up. She checks it hoping to see an unknown number but to her dismay it\u2019s just a notification from her period tracking app. She tries to focus on her work but now all she can think about is Harry texting her. </p><p>For some reason she feels a bit like somethings missing from herself. All the conversations, jokes, looks, and smiles added up and created a warm little spot in Erica\u2019s heart and now that he\u2019s across campus instead of with her the new bit of herself she gained through harry is absent. All she had now are memories. She remembers seeing him at the assembly and the book he was reading. </p><p>She quickly grabs her phone and buys the ebook version. She begins reading and makes the mixtape for the first chapter in Spotify. She proceeds to read and listen with the little thought in the back of her head that Harry had read these same words and heard these same beats and lyrics. What had he thought about them? </p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p>Later that day, after Y/N had taken Valentina for a walk, ate dinner, and finished up some school work she began to grow impatient waiting for his text. She occupied herself with reading but she still couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was taking him so long. Through the law of attraction or simply by coincidence she received a message from an unfamiliar number. </p><p><i>\u201cHope this is the right number. Couldn\u2019t tell if it was a 3 or an 8. -h\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes this is the right number. Sorry for the hand writing.\u201d</i></p><p>Harry sends the two pictures of him in the black suit option and in the grey suit option. Watching the three dots in the message bubble as she types feels like the most excrutiating 5 seconds of his life. </p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about fashion but both are really nice. I\u2019d say the grey one though :)\u201d </i></p><p>Y/N watched the typing symbol and each time three dots flutter she feels her heart beat quicker. </p><p><i>\u201cPerfect. Thanks for your input. What are you wearing?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBlack shorts and a red halter top, why?\u201d </i></p><p>Immediately after pressing send Y/N understands what he meant.</p><p><i>\u201cI meant to the dance \ud83d\ude02\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize until after sorry \ud83d\ude02. I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be lovely. I gotta go grade some papers, talk to you tomorrow?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c:) perfect\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N goes back and forth thinking about responding but decides the conversation is dead and locks her phone grinning widely. </p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p><i>Thank you for reading! xx</i></p>",

Everything began to remind her of him. The bells signaling a class beginning and ending made her wonder how he greets his students, was it as polite as he had greeted her? Her students that were taking his course had said he was a funny teacher. Perhaps he opened class with a joke. The lovely rose bushes at the front of the school she passed by on her way to her car now made her wonder what Harry\u2019s favorite flower was. His pretentious exterior would make her assume it\u2019s some rare flower with an extremely hard name to pronounce that grows every 20 years, but the brief glimpse she got into his true personality makes her believe it\u2019s probably a simple plant like a rose or carnation. On her way home as she passed restaurant after restaurant she wondered what his favorite food was. More than anything she wondered what restaurant would be suitable for a first date. When she got home and was greeted by her child, a small white Bolognese dog called Valentina, she wondered if harry was a dog or cat person or maybe both. Needless to say Y/N was completely infatuated with Harry. </p><p>These feeling weren\u2019t one sided. Harry\u2019s mind was completely caught up in how he\u2019d start their next conversation.

He picks up his book from the ground and says \u201cWe can go in my car.\u201d She nods and they walk out to the parking lot. </p><p>They walk past Y/N\u2019s car and harry scoffs. She confusedly asks \u201cwhat?\u201d He says \u201cThis car has been parking in my parking space for a month.\u201d Y/N, now amused by his frustration asks \u201cIs your name on it?\u201d He says \u201cNo but I\u2019ve parked here for the past 2 years.\u201d She shrugs and says \u201cThat\u2019s real life. It\u2019s not going to be happy all the time.\u201d He fake pouts at her use of his previous quotes and says \u201cOi, here I am tryna take you out for some tacos and you mock me. What a minx.\u201d She giggles and they get into his car. </p><p>Y/N breaks the silence almost immediately and asks \u201cAre you gonna chaperone the dance?\u201d Harry doesn\u2019t want to say his true opinion in fear it\u2019d conflict with hers but he doesn\u2019t want to lie and be in-genuine. He finds a middle ground and says \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Seems a little odd, ya know. Hovering over the students while they\u2019re just trying to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>Y/N moves her head in agreement and says \u201cYeah it is a little weird. At my Homecoming senior year there was only 3 teachers who chaperoned so everyone brought mini vodka bottles and grinded on each other. So I understand why they have chaperones.\u201d Harry laughs and says \u201cDid you participate in the vodka and grinding?\u201d Y/N fake scoffs and jokingly says \u201cHow dare you! I was a straight B student, I would never!\u201d They both laugh and Y/N says \u201cWanna go to homecoming with me?\u201d </p><p>Harry can\u2019t fight the huge grin and blush making their way to his face and neither can Y/N. She feels like she\u2019s back in high school and just told her crush she liked them. Harry nods and says \u201cYeah. As long as you bring the mini vodka bottles.\u201d They both smile at each other briefly and Y/N tries to contain her excitement. She gets her phone out and begins to email Mrs. Nas informing her on their desire to chaperone. </p><p>Once she\u2019s done she reads it aloud, \u201cDear Mrs. Nas, Me and Mr. Styles are interested in chaperoning this years homecoming dance. What additional information should we know prior to next Saturday\u2019s dance?\u201d Harry quickly says \u201cMr. Styles and I.\u201d Y/N corrects the error and says \u201cWhere were you to proof read all my essays?\u201d </p><p>They finally arrive at the taco shop drive thru and order their food. When they get to the window Y/N opens her phone case to pull out the $10 she always keeps in case of emergencies but Harry\u2019s already handing the worker $20. She gives Harry the $10 but he shakes his head and says \u201cS\u2019fine love. Keep it.\u201d Y/N isn\u2019t taking no for answer so as harry is focused on grabbing the bag of food from the window, Y/N puts the $10 in the middle console quickly. </p><p>She grabs the bag from him so he can continue driving and she says \u201cThank you.\u201d He says \u201cNo problem. Now what color tie should I wear?\u201d Y/N laughs and says \u201cWhatever you want. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d Harry mentally pictures his closet and says \u201cGrey blazer and trousers with a black shirt or black blazer and trousers with a pink shirt?\u201d Y/N is the last person he should come to for fashion tips. \u201cUm. I don\u2019t know I\u2019d have to see what they look like.\u201d With a sudden boost of confidence Harry says \u201cI\u2019ll send you a picture later.\u201d Y/N just nods not trusting her mouth. </p><p>On the note of fashion and clothing Y/N asks \u201cWhat are you planning on wearing for spirit week?\u201d Harry\u2019s face contorts into something Y/N can only describe as surprise and confusion. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna dress up actually.\u201d Y/N immediately inquires \u201cWhy not? If you don\u2019t have anything for some of the days I could let you borrow some stuff. You could also go to the thrift store so you don\u2019t waste money on stuff you\u2019re only gonna wear once.\u201d Harry shakes his head and says \u201cNo no. It\u2019s not that. Just seems a bit\u2026silly.\u201d </p><p>Y/N feels a bit defensive and says \u201cIt\u2019s not silly. The way I see it is if teachers dress up it shows the students that they have spirit for the school too.\u201d Harry shrugs and says \u201cMost students don\u2019t even want to be at school. Me wearing pajamas isn\u2019t going to change that.\u201d </p><p>Y/N frowns at his pessimistic remarks. She\u2019s always been a \u2018half full\u2019 type of person. This mixed with her stubbornness made her determined to change Harry\u2019s mind. As they pull into the school parking lot she says \u201cIt\u2019s just one week. I\u2019ll help you if you need it.\u201d </p><p>He pulls into the same parking spot he left 20 minutes ago and says \u201cWhat even is Royalty Day?\u201d They get out of the car and Y/N happily answers \u201cYou get to dress up as a prince or princess.\u201d Harry grabs the bag from her hand and says \u201cHow is wearing a crown showing I have school spirit again?\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes as they walk into the school and says \u201cIt\u2019s about your intentions not what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d </p><p>She opens her classroom door and holds it open as she let\u2019s Harry in first. He puts the bag of food down on a desk and she moves two desks to face one another. They both sit and she still holds onto her argument. \u201cI still think you should dress up next week.\u201d Harry can\u2019t help but smile at her insistent determination. \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone so passionate about Pajama Day.\u201d They both laugh and she says \u201cI\u2019m extremely passionate. Don\u2019t even get me started on Twin Day.\u201d </p><p>They share a giggle as they lock eyes and Harry can\u2019t say no to her any longer. \u201cWhich celebrity should I dress up as?\u201d Y/N immediately lights up and says \u201cYou\u2019d make a great Danny DeVito.\u201d </p><p>They both laugh and enjoy the rest of lunch discussing outfit ideas and eating their tacos. The bell ringing knocks them out of the world they subconsciously created with each other. They quickly clean up and move the desks back then Harry remembers, \u201cCan I have your number? So I can show you the suits.\u201d Y/N nods and says \u201coh yeah let me write it down for you.\u201d She quickly grabs a pen and sticky note from Mrs. Meyers\u2019 desk and writes her number with a smiley face. She hands it to him and he quickly says \u201cHad a good time.\u201d And exits the classroom.</p><p>Almost immediately students start funneling in and Mrs. Meyers is only 7 minutes late to class this time. When 6th period rolls around Y/N makes sure to congratulate Julia. </p><p>The rest of class Y/N plays a French film since it\u2019s Friday. As she catches up on some of her own school work she sees her phone light up. She checks it hoping to see an unknown number but to her dismay it\u2019s just a notification from her period tracking app. She tries to focus on her work but now all she can think about is Harry texting her. </p><p>For some reason she feels a bit like somethings missing from herself. All the conversations, jokes, looks, and smiles added up and created a warm little spot in Erica\u2019s heart and now that he\u2019s across campus instead of with her the new bit of herself she gained through harry is absent. All she had now are memories. She remembers seeing him at the assembly and the book he was reading. </p><p>She quickly grabs her phone and buys the ebook version. She begins reading and makes the mixtape for the first chapter in Spotify. She proceeds to read and listen with the little thought in the back of her head that Harry had read these same words and heard these same beats and lyrics. What had he thought about them? </p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p>Later that day, after Y/N had taken Valentina for a walk, ate dinner, and finished up some school work she began to grow impatient waiting for his text. She occupied herself with reading but she still couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was taking him so long. Through the law of attraction or simply by coincidence she received a message from an unfamiliar number. </p><p><i>\u201cHope this is the right number. Couldn\u2019t tell if it was a 3 or an 8. -h\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes this is the right number. Sorry for the hand writing.\u201d</i></p><p>Harry sends the two pictures of him in the black suit option and in the grey suit option. Watching the three dots in the message bubble as she types feels like the most excrutiating 5 seconds of his life. </p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about fashion but both are really nice. I\u2019d say the grey one though :)\u201d </i></p><p>Y/N watched the typing symbol and each time three dots flutter she feels her heart beat quicker. </p><p><i>\u201cPerfect. Thanks for your input. What are you wearing?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBlack shorts and a red halter top, why?\u201d </i></p><p>Immediately after pressing send Y/N understands what he meant.</p><p><i>\u201cI meant to the dance \ud83d\ude02\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize until after sorry \ud83d\ude02. I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be lovely. I gotta go grade some papers, talk to you tomorrow?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c:) perfect\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N goes back and forth thinking about responding but decides the conversation is dead and locks her phone grinning widely. </p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p><i>Thank you for reading! xx</i></p></p>",

Everything began to remind her of him. The bells signaling a class beginning and ending made her wonder how he greets his students, was it as polite as he had greeted her? Her students that were taking his course had said he was a funny teacher. Perhaps he opened class with a joke. The lovely rose bushes at the front of the school she passed by on her way to her car now made her wonder what Harry\u2019s favorite flower was. His pretentious exterior would make her assume it\u2019s some rare flower with an extremely hard name to pronounce that grows every 20 years, but the brief glimpse she got into his true personality makes her believe it\u2019s probably a simple plant like a rose or carnation. On her way home as she passed restaurant after restaurant she wondered what his favorite food was. More than anything she wondered what restaurant would be suitable for a first date. When she got home and was greeted by her child, a small white Bolognese dog called Valentina, she wondered if harry was a dog or cat person or maybe both. Needless to say Y/N was completely infatuated with Harry. </p><p>These feeling weren\u2019t one sided. Harry\u2019s mind was completely caught up in how he\u2019d start their next conversation. He crossed off ideas of going into her classroom and meeting her in the parking lot after school because they seemed a little invasive. But what more was he left with? He had regretted not meeting her sooner and he knew if he waited too long to start talking to her on a regular basis he\u2019d be filled with even more regret. </p><p>Luckily for them both their students had it all figured out\u2026again.</p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p><i>Friday September 14, 2018 7:35 am</i></p><p>As school began Harry actually listened to the announcements for once. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t care about what was going on at the school, he just figured that the information was meant for students and didn\u2019t require his attention. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t miss today\u2019s assembly where we\u2019ll be announcing this years Homecoming Court.\u201d </p><p>Harry still finds the whole \u2018King\u2019 and \u2018Queen\u2019 thing funny. Growing up in England, he never got to experience things like \u2018Homecoming\u2019 or \u2018Prom\u2019. Yes he\u2019d hear about it and see it in American films and television shows but it was something he never really understood. Why was there so much intense competition and campaigning for a plastic crown and title no one will care about the next day? Nevertheless, he hypocritically hoped at least one of his students won. </p><p>\u201cHomecoming week starts on Monday, dress up for all the spirit days. Monday is Pajama Day, Tuesday is Beach Day, Wednesday is Celebrity Day, Thursday is Twin Day, and Friday is Royalty Day.\u201d </p><p>Harry chuckles to himself at the silly dress up week but his students seem to be pleased as they whisper to one another about outfit ideas. </p><p>\u201cTeachers, if you want to chaperone this years homecoming dance email Mrs. Nas by Monday for all the details. Have a great day!\u201d </p><p>Julia immediately says \u201cMr. Styles you should be a chaperone.\u201d Everyone shows their signs of agreement and says \u201cWhat makes you think I want to spend my Saturday night making sure you guys aren\u2019t drinking, doing drugs, or having sex?\u201d Kyle smirks and says \u201cI think I overheard Ms. Y/N saying that she was gonna chaperone.\u201d The whole class smirks at Harry and he feels his blood rush to his face. He composes himself and says \u201cWell then I\u2019ll consider. Clear your desks for the test please.\u201d Julia asks \u201cIf I get nominated for Homecoming court will you change my score?\u201d Harry smiles at her attempt and says \u201cNice try, but no. Good luck though.\u201d She gives a small smile and nod then asks \u201cIf I get nominated will you ask Ms.Y/N out?\u201d Harry acts like he didn\u2019t hear her over the sound of all the other students putting their things away but makes a small promise to himself that if any of his students were nominated, he\u2019d ask her out. </p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p><i>Friday September 14, 2018 11:30 am</i></p><p>Y/N makes her way to the gymnasium for the assembly contemplating if she should dress up as Ariana Grande or Pam from The Office for Celebrity Day. As she walks in she stays towards the back where some of the other teachers are. When she sees Harry standing against the wall reading a book she feels that same tingle in the pit of her stomach and something new in her chest she can\u2019t quite describe. </p><p>She immediately walks over to him and says \u201cWhatcha reading?\u201d He jumps a little from the sudden voice but immediately calms as he sees who it belongs to. He folds the corner of the page to save his place then closes it to show her the cover and says \u201cLove Is a Mixtape by Rob Sheffield.\u201d Harry puts the book down on the floor near his feet and Y/N asks \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d </p><p>He avoids eye contact and just looks across the room at nothing in particular. He crosses his arms and ankles as he leans against the wall and says \u201cIt\u2019s an autobiography about his wife and how they dealt with her dying through music. Each chapter comes with a mixtape of songs to listen to while reading. It\u2019s really good. Very well written.\u201d </p><p>Y/N continues studying his face as she says \u201cSeems quite sad.\u201d He shrugs and says \u201cIts real life. Not everything\u2019s happy all the time. I think it\u2019s lovely how he turned a tragedy into a beautiful piece of literature. The mixtapes are the same ones they made together, it really adds to the emotion.\u201d </p><p>Y/N doesn\u2019t know much about literature let alone as much as a AP Literature teacher would so she just accepts his statement with a few nods then says \u201cWell if you think it\u2019s good I\u2019ll read it.\u201d Harry looks at her face for the first time  since she got here and opens his mouth to speak but is cut off by the start of the assembly.</p><p>The whole assembly feels like it\u2019s in slow motion for Harry as he just wants the noise to come to an end so he can talk to Y/N. But for her the assembly is going by too fast. She wants time to slow down so she can stand this close to harry for longer.</p><p>When they begin to announce the court Harry closely listens for one of his students\u2019 names. Finally he hears Julia\u2019s name and both him and Y/N clap enthusiastically. Y/N turns to Harry and says \u201cShe\u2019s been nervous all week about this.\u201d Harry nods recalling the past few days of Julia not paying attention in class and staring off into space. </p><p>The assembly comes to a close and lunch time immediately begins. Y/N is afraid Harry will leave right away but to her surprise he says \u201cDo you wanna go grab lunch?\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s not completely asking her out but it\u2019s a step and Harry isn\u2019t planning on breaking the promise he made with himself. </p><p>Y/N doesn\u2019t know if she heard him right or if she\u2019s delusional but when he elaborates and says \u201cS\u2019fine if you don\u2019t. Just wanted to ask.\u201d She immediately smiles being reassured that she\u2019s not in fact hearing things. \u201cI\u2019d love to grab lunch with you.\u201d </p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t know exactly what to do next; he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get this far. He picks up his book from the ground and says \u201cWe can go in my car.\u201d She nods and they walk out to the parking lot. </p><p>They walk past Y/N\u2019s car and harry scoffs. She confusedly asks \u201cwhat?\u201d He says \u201cThis car has been parking in my parking space for a month.\u201d Y/N, now amused by his frustration asks \u201cIs your name on it?\u201d He says \u201cNo but I\u2019ve parked here for the past 2 years.\u201d She shrugs and says \u201cThat\u2019s real life. It\u2019s not going to be happy all the time.\u201d He fake pouts at her use of his previous quotes and says \u201cOi, here I am tryna take you out for some tacos and you mock me. What a minx.\u201d She giggles and they get into his car. </p><p>Y/N breaks the silence almost immediately and asks \u201cAre you gonna chaperone the dance?\u201d Harry doesn\u2019t want to say his true opinion in fear it\u2019d conflict with hers but he doesn\u2019t want to lie and be in-genuine. He finds a middle ground and says \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Seems a little odd, ya know. Hovering over the students while they\u2019re just trying to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>Y/N moves her head in agreement and says \u201cYeah it is a little weird. At my Homecoming senior year there was only 3 teachers who chaperoned so everyone brought mini vodka bottles and grinded on each other. So I understand why they have chaperones.\u201d Harry laughs and says \u201cDid you participate in the vodka and grinding?\u201d Y/N fake scoffs and jokingly says \u201cHow dare you! I was a straight B student, I would never!\u201d They both laugh and Y/N says \u201cWanna go to homecoming with me?\u201d </p><p>Harry can\u2019t fight the huge grin and blush making their way to his face and neither can Y/N. She feels like she\u2019s back in high school and just told her crush she liked them. Harry nods and says \u201cYeah. As long as you bring the mini vodka bottles.\u201d They both smile at each other briefly and Y/N tries to contain her excitement. She gets her phone out and begins to email Mrs. Nas informing her on their desire to chaperone. </p><p>Once she\u2019s done she reads it aloud, \u201cDear Mrs. Nas, Me and Mr. Styles are interested in chaperoning this years homecoming dance. What additional information should we know prior to next Saturday\u2019s dance?\u201d Harry quickly says \u201cMr. Styles and I.\u201d Y/N corrects the error and says \u201cWhere were you to proof read all my essays?\u201d </p><p>They finally arrive at the taco shop drive thru and order their food. When they get to the window Y/N opens her phone case to pull out the $10 she always keeps in case of emergencies but Harry\u2019s already handing the worker $20. She gives Harry the $10 but he shakes his head and says \u201cS\u2019fine love. Keep it.\u201d Y/N isn\u2019t taking no for answer so as harry is focused on grabbing the bag of food from the window, Y/N puts the $10 in the middle console quickly. </p><p>She grabs the bag from him so he can continue driving and she says \u201cThank you.\u201d He says \u201cNo problem. Now what color tie should I wear?\u201d Y/N laughs and says \u201cWhatever you want. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d Harry mentally pictures his closet and says \u201cGrey blazer and trousers with a black shirt or black blazer and trousers with a pink shirt?\u201d Y/N is the last person he should come to for fashion tips. \u201cUm. I don\u2019t know I\u2019d have to see what they look like.\u201d With a sudden boost of confidence Harry says \u201cI\u2019ll send you a picture later.\u201d Y/N just nods not trusting her mouth. </p><p>On the note of fashion and clothing Y/N asks \u201cWhat are you planning on wearing for spirit week?\u201d Harry\u2019s face contorts into something Y/N can only describe as surprise and confusion. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna dress up actually.\u201d Y/N immediately inquires \u201cWhy not? If you don\u2019t have anything for some of the days I could let you borrow some stuff. You could also go to the thrift store so you don\u2019t waste money on stuff you\u2019re only gonna wear once.\u201d Harry shakes his head and says \u201cNo no. It\u2019s not that. Just seems a bit\u2026silly.\u201d </p><p>Y/N feels a bit defensive and says \u201cIt\u2019s not silly. The way I see it is if teachers dress up it shows the students that they have spirit for the school too.\u201d Harry shrugs and says \u201cMost students don\u2019t even want to be at school. Me wearing pajamas isn\u2019t going to change that.\u201d </p><p>Y/N frowns at his pessimistic remarks. She\u2019s always been a \u2018half full\u2019 type of person. This mixed with her stubbornness made her determined to change Harry\u2019s mind. As they pull into the school parking lot she says \u201cIt\u2019s just one week. I\u2019ll help you if you need it.\u201d </p><p>He pulls into the same parking spot he left 20 minutes ago and says \u201cWhat even is Royalty Day?\u201d They get out of the car and Y/N happily answers \u201cYou get to dress up as a prince or princess.\u201d Harry grabs the bag from her hand and says \u201cHow is wearing a crown showing I have school spirit again?\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes as they walk into the school and says \u201cIt\u2019s about your intentions not what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d </p><p>She opens her classroom door and holds it open as she let\u2019s Harry in first. He puts the bag of food down on a desk and she moves two desks to face one another. They both sit and she still holds onto her argument. \u201cI still think you should dress up next week.\u201d Harry can\u2019t help but smile at her insistent determination. \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone so passionate about Pajama Day.\u201d They both laugh and she says \u201cI\u2019m extremely passionate. Don\u2019t even get me started on Twin Day.\u201d </p><p>They share a giggle as they lock eyes and Harry can\u2019t say no to her any longer. \u201cWhich celebrity should I dress up as?\u201d Y/N immediately lights up and says \u201cYou\u2019d make a great Danny DeVito.\u201d </p><p>They both laugh and enjoy the rest of lunch discussing outfit ideas and eating their tacos. The bell ringing knocks them out of the world they subconsciously created with each other. They quickly clean up and move the desks back then Harry remembers, \u201cCan I have your number? So I can show you the suits.\u201d Y/N nods and says \u201coh yeah let me write it down for you.\u201d She quickly grabs a pen and sticky note from Mrs. Meyers\u2019 desk and writes her number with a smiley face. She hands it to him and he quickly says \u201cHad a good time.\u201d And exits the classroom.</p><p>Almost immediately students start funneling in and Mrs. Meyers is only 7 minutes late to class this time. When 6th period rolls around Y/N makes sure to congratulate Julia. </p><p>The rest of class Y/N plays a French film since it\u2019s Friday. As she catches up on some of her own school work she sees her phone light up. She checks it hoping to see an unknown number but to her dismay it\u2019s just a notification from her period tracking app. She tries to focus on her work but now all she can think about is Harry texting her. </p><p>For some reason she feels a bit like somethings missing from herself. All the conversations, jokes, looks, and smiles added up and created a warm little spot in Erica\u2019s heart and now that he\u2019s across campus instead of with her the new bit of herself she gained through harry is absent. All she had now are memories. She remembers seeing him at the assembly and the book he was reading. </p><p>She quickly grabs her phone and buys the ebook version. She begins reading and makes the mixtape for the first chapter in Spotify. She proceeds to read and listen with the little thought in the back of her head that Harry had read these same words and heard these same beats and lyrics. What had he thought about them? </p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p>Later that day, after Y/N had taken Valentina for a walk, ate dinner, and finished up some school work she began to grow impatient waiting for his text. She occupied herself with reading but she still couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was taking him so long. Through the law of attraction or simply by coincidence she received a message from an unfamiliar number. </p><p><i>\u201cHope this is the right number.

Sorry for the hand writing.\u201d</i></p><p>Harry sends the two pictures of him in the black suit option and in the grey suit option. Watching the three dots in the message bubble as she types feels like the most excrutiating 5 seconds of his life. </p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about fashion but both are really nice. I\u2019d say the grey one though :)\u201d </i></p><p>Y/N watched the typing symbol and each time three dots flutter she feels her heart beat quicker. </p><p><i>\u201cPerfect. Thanks for your input.

I tried every weekend then got busy and distracted with other story ideas. I think I can keep up now though. I think I&rsquo;m gonna start a new story in addition to this one but we&rsquo;ll see how long it takes for me to write the first part for that one.</i></p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p>After the brief run in and walk to the janitors room Y/N could not shake Harry from her mind. Everything began to remind her of him. The bells signaling a class beginning and ending made her wonder how he greets his students, was it as polite as he had greeted her? Her students that were taking his course had said he was a funny teacher. Perhaps he opened class with a joke. The lovely rose bushes at the front of the school she passed by on her way to her car now made her wonder what Harry&rsquo;s favorite flower was. His pretentious exterior would make her assume it&rsquo;s some rare flower with an extremely hard name to pronounce that grows every 20 years, but the brief glimpse she got into his true personality makes her believe it&rsquo;s probably a simple plant like a rose or carnation. On her way home as she passed restaurant after restaurant she wondered what his favorite food was. More than anything she wondered what restaurant would be suitable for a first date. When she got home and was greeted by her child, a small white Bolognese dog called Valentina, she wondered if harry was a dog or cat person or maybe both. Needless to say Y/N was completely infatuated with Harry. </p><p>These feeling weren&rsquo;t one sided. Harry&rsquo;s mind was completely caught up in how he&rsquo;d start their next conversation. He crossed off ideas of going into her classroom and meeting her in the parking lot after school because they seemed a little invasive. But what more was he left with? He had regretted not meeting her sooner and he knew if he waited too long to start talking to her on a regular basis he&rsquo;d be filled with even more regret. </p><p>Luckily for them both their students had it all figured out&hellip;again.</p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p><i>Friday September 14, 2018 7:35 am</i></p><p>As school began Harry actually listened to the announcements for once. It&rsquo;s not that he didn&rsquo;t care about what was going on at the school, he just figured that the information was meant for students and didn&rsquo;t require his attention. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t miss today&rsquo;s assembly where we&rsquo;ll be announcing this years Homecoming Court.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry still finds the whole &lsquo;King&rsquo; and &lsquo;Queen&rsquo; thing funny. Growing up in England, he never got to experience things like &lsquo;Homecoming&rsquo; or &lsquo;Prom&rsquo;. Yes he&rsquo;d hear about it and see it in American films and television shows but it was something he never really understood. Why was there so much intense competition and campaigning for a plastic crown and title no one will care about the next day? Nevertheless, he hypocritically hoped at least one of his students won. </p><p>&ldquo;Homecoming week starts on Monday, dress up for all the spirit days. Monday is Pajama Day, Tuesday is Beach Day, Wednesday is Celebrity Day, Thursday is Twin Day, and Friday is Royalty Day.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry chuckles to himself at the silly dress up week but his students seem to be pleased as they whisper to one another about outfit ideas. </p><p>&ldquo;Teachers, if you want to chaperone this years homecoming dance email Mrs. Nas by Monday for all the details. Have a great day!&rdquo; </p><p>Julia immediately says &ldquo;Mr. Styles you should be a chaperone.&rdquo; Everyone shows their signs of agreement and says &ldquo;What makes you think I want to spend my Saturday night making sure you guys aren&rsquo;t drinking, doing drugs, or having sex?&rdquo; Kyle smirks and says &ldquo;I think I overheard Ms. Y/N saying that she was gonna chaperone.&rdquo; The whole class smirks at Harry and he feels his blood rush to his face. He composes himself and says &ldquo;Well then I&rsquo;ll consider. Clear your desks for the test please.&rdquo; Julia asks &ldquo;If I get nominated for Homecoming court will you change my score?&rdquo; Harry smiles at her attempt and says &ldquo;Nice try, but no. Good luck though.&rdquo; She gives a small smile and nod then asks &ldquo;If I get nominated will you ask Ms.Y/N out?&rdquo; Harry acts like he didn&rsquo;t hear her over the sound of all the other students putting their things away but makes a small promise to himself that if any of his students were nominated, he&rsquo;d ask her out. </p><p>.               .               .               .               .              .</p><p><i>Friday September 14, 2018 11:30 am</i></p><p>Y/N makes her way to the gymnasium for the assembly contemplating if she should dress up as Ariana Grande or Pam from The Office for Celebrity Day. As she walks in she stays towards the back where some of the other teachers are. When she sees Harry standing against the wall reading a book she feels that same tingle in the pit of her stomach and something new in her chest she can&rsquo;t quite describe. </p><p>She immediately walks over to him and says &ldquo;Whatcha reading?&rdquo; He jumps a little from the sudden voice but immediately calms as he sees who it belongs to. He folds the corner of the page to save his place then closes it to show her the cover and says &ldquo;Love Is a Mixtape by Rob Sheffield.&rdquo; Harry puts the book down on the floor near his feet and Y/N asks &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; </p><p>He avoids eye contact and just looks across the room at nothing in particular. He crosses his arms and ankles as he leans against the wall and says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an autobiography about his wife and how they dealt with her dying through music. Each chapter comes with a mixtape of songs to listen to while reading. It&rsquo;s really good. Very well written.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N continues studying his face as she says &ldquo;Seems quite sad.&rdquo; He shrugs and says &ldquo;Its real life. Not everything&rsquo;s happy all the time. I think it&rsquo;s lovely how he turned a tragedy into a beautiful piece of literature. The mixtapes are the same ones they made together, it really adds to the emotion.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N doesn&rsquo;t know much about literature let alone as much as a AP Literature teacher would so she just accepts his statement with a few nods then says &ldquo;Well if you think it&rsquo;s good I&rsquo;ll read it.&rdquo; Harry looks at her face for the first time  since she got here and opens his mouth to speak but is cut off by the start of the assembly.</p><p>The whole assembly feels like it&rsquo;s in slow motion for Harry as he just wants the noise to come to an end so he can talk to Y/N. But for her the assembly is going by too fast. She wants time to slow down so she can stand this close to harry for longer.</p><p>When they begin to announce the court Harry closely listens for one of his students&rsquo; names. Finally he hears Julia&rsquo;s name and both him and Y/N clap enthusiastically. Y/N turns to Harry and says &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been nervous all week about this.&rdquo; Harry nods recalling the past few days of Julia not paying attention in class and staring off into space. </p><p>The assembly comes to a close and lunch time immediately begins. Y/N is afraid Harry will leave right away but to her surprise he says &ldquo;Do you wanna go grab lunch?&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s not completely asking her out but it&rsquo;s a step and Harry isn&rsquo;t planning on breaking the promise he made with himself. </p><p>Y/N doesn&rsquo;t know if she heard him right or if she&rsquo;s delusional but when he elaborates and says &ldquo;S&rsquo;fine if you don&rsquo;t. Just wanted to ask.&rdquo; She immediately smiles being reassured that she&rsquo;s not in fact hearing things. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to grab lunch with you.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry doesn&rsquo;t know exactly what to do next; he didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d get this far. He picks up his book from the ground and says &ldquo;We can go in my car.&rdquo; She nods and they walk out to the parking lot. </p><p>They walk past Y/N&rsquo;s car and harry scoffs. She confusedly asks &ldquo;what?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;This car has been parking in my parking space for a month.&rdquo; Y/N, now amused by his frustration asks &ldquo;Is your name on it?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;No but I&rsquo;ve parked here for the past 2 years.&rdquo; She shrugs and says &ldquo;That&rsquo;s real life. It&rsquo;s not going to be happy all the time.&rdquo; He fake pouts at her use of his previous quotes and says &ldquo;Oi, here I am tryna take you out for some tacos and you mock me. What a minx.&rdquo; She giggles and they get into his car. </p><p>Y/N breaks the silence almost immediately and asks &ldquo;Are you gonna chaperone the dance?&rdquo; Harry doesn&rsquo;t want to say his true opinion in fear it&rsquo;d conflict with hers but he doesn&rsquo;t want to lie and be in-genuine. He finds a middle ground and says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Seems a little odd, ya know. Hovering over the students while they&rsquo;re just trying to have a good time.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N moves her head in agreement and says &ldquo;Yeah it is a little weird. At my Homecoming senior year there was only 3 teachers who chaperoned so everyone brought mini vodka bottles and grinded on each other. So I understand why they have chaperones.&rdquo; Harry laughs and says &ldquo;Did you participate in the vodka and grinding?&rdquo; Y/N fake scoffs and jokingly says &ldquo;How dare you! I was a straight B student, I would never!&rdquo; They both laugh and Y/N says &ldquo;Wanna go to homecoming with me?&rdquo; </p><p>Harry can&rsquo;t fight the huge grin and blush making their way to his face and neither can Y/N. She feels like she&rsquo;s back in high school and just told her crush she liked them. Harry nods and says &ldquo;Yeah. As long as you bring the mini vodka bottles.&rdquo; They both smile at each other briefly and Y/N tries to contain her excitement. She gets her phone out and begins to email Mrs. Nas informing her on their desire to chaperone. </p><p>Once she&rsquo;s done she reads it aloud, &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Nas, Me and Mr. Styles are interested in chaperoning this years homecoming dance. What additional information should we know prior to next Saturday&rsquo;s dance?&rdquo; Harry quickly says &ldquo;Mr. Styles and I.&rdquo; Y/N corrects the error and says &ldquo;Where were you to proof read all my essays?&rdquo; </p><p>They finally arrive at the taco shop drive thru and order their food. When they get to the window Y/N opens her phone case to pull out the $10 she always keeps in case of emergencies but Harry&rsquo;s already handing the worker $20. She gives Harry the $10 but he shakes his head and says &ldquo;S&rsquo;fine love. Keep it.&rdquo; Y/N isn&rsquo;t taking no for answer so as harry is focused on grabbing the bag of food from the window, Y/N puts the $10 in the middle console quickly. </p><p>She grabs the bag from him so he can continue driving and she says &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;No problem. Now what color tie should I wear?&rdquo; Y/N laughs and says &ldquo;Whatever you want.
