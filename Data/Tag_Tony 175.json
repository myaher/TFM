He jumped slightly as soft hands suddenly started running through his damp hair, but settled against the familiar press of Peter against his back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine and dandy.\u201d Tony mumbled.\u00a0\u201cI haven&rsquo;t eaten solid food in a while, maybe I should do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Thai upstairs.\u201d Peter said.\u00a0\u201cI already ate, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if you we\u2019re gonna keep working.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s- yeah, that\u2019s great babe, thanks.\u201d Tony said, spinning around on his stool to press his forehead into Peter\u2019s stomach, hiding his face as the boy wrapped his arms around Tony\u2019s broad shoulders.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven&rsquo;t- I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been in the\u00a0\u2018shop a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while might be putting it mildly, you haven&rsquo;t come to bed with me for three nights.\u201d Peter chuckled.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that makes me happier than seeing you create, Tony, you know that, and if that means I spend some time without you, then that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re too good to me.\u201d Tony huffed, pulling away from Peter\u2019s embrace, standing to press a soft kiss against the boy\u2019s lips.\u00a0\u201cGotta eat before I pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>Peter had already set out tubs of food for Tony when they made it back up the kitchen, and the older man nodded gratefully as he collapsed into a chair, Peter sitting opposite him, surrounded by textbooks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cM\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res.\u201d Tony said suddenly, head snapping up to meet Peter\u2019s questioning look.\u00a0\u201cSorry, Pepper wants me to choose a charity that\u2019s represented at some Stark Foundation gala. MSF is a good one, right? No scandals? And it\u2019ll be a nod to Bruce, wherever he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d Peter nodded.\u00a0\u201cGood idea.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony narrowed his eyes at the hesitant tone in Peter\u2019s voice, the way he kept fidgeting even as he looked back down at his textbook.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSpit it out.\u201d Tony commanded eventually.\u00a0\u201cYou wanna say something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I pick a charity?\u201d Peter asked, fighting to keep his voice steady.\u00a0\u201cI know MSF is a great charity, obviously it is, but they\u2019re big, popular, get a lot of exposure already and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Tony shrugged, digging back into his food.\u00a0\u201cGot anything in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s- there\u2019s a charity in Queens, tailored to, uhm, helping survivors of childhood sexual assault.\u201d Peter said, his voice rough.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019d mean a lot to me if they could get the kind of funding they deserve, that you could provide them with.\u201d</p><p>Tony was looking at Peter with wide eyes, plastic fork dropped to the table, forgotten as he stared at the tears in his boyfriends eyes and his suddenly pale face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeems like a worthy cause. I\u2019ll pass it on.\u201d Tony said eventually.\u00a0\u201cSomething we need to talk about, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Peter nodded.\u00a0\u201cNot- not here? Feels too much like an interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Tony agreed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna finish up here, you wanna go shower? I got mine down in the\u00a0\u2018shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched carefully as Peter gathered his textbooks and laptop, and flashed Tony a weathered smile when he caught him staring. The older man did his best to keep his breathing steady and expression neutral as he watched Peter go, but couldn&rsquo;t help gritting his teeth, digging his nails into his palm. Someone had taken advantage of his baby, his love, when he was too young to understand what was happening or how to stop it, and the thought alone made Tony want to put his fist through a wall.\u00a0</p><p>Eventually he relaxed enough to clear up the empty boxes on the kitchen table, emptying them into the trash before heading towards their bedroom, noting that the shower had shut off in the en suite. Tony shucked his clothes, leaving them on the floor to be whisked away by a housekeeping bot, and climbed into bed, averting his eyes from the closed bathroom door by picking up his tablet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy skin\u2019s so dry.\u201d complained Peter as he walked out of the en suite, making Tony jump slightly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m<i> flaking</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Pepper.\u201d Tony grinned.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019ll take you to some fancy dermatologist or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy skin\u2019s dry Tony, not falling off.\u201d Peter deadpanned.\u00a0\u201cI just need some moisturiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t an old man pamper his beautiful boyfriend?\u201d Tony pouted, then held his arms out.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused, shuffling his feet, but Tony\u2019s cuddles were always too good to pass up, so he was crawling under the covers and wrapping himself in Tony\u2019s embrace before he knew what he was doing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe don&rsquo;t have to talk about this now.\u201d Tony murmured into Peter\u2019s still-damp hair.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not gonna pressure anything out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we don&rsquo;t talk about this now, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m keeping something from you.\u201d Peter admitted.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t let it rule me- it happened, and if I can\u2019t talk to you about it, then it\u2019s controlling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Tony nodded.</p><p>Peter hesitated, grounding himself, focusing on the sensation of tony surrounding him, protecting him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was young, too young to understand what was going on, maybe eight or nine.\u201d Peter said, voice rough with emotion.\u00a0\u201cHis name was Skip, Steven actually, but everyone called him Skip. He lived in the apartment next door, and he\u2019d babysit me occasionally, when May and Ben had to work.\u00a0 He, uh, he showed me a porn magazine. I didn&rsquo;t really understand what it was.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused to swallow nervously, and Tony kept his hand stroking gently through the boy\u2019s hair, an anchor point, appearing entirely calm, except from the twitch in his jawline that betrayed he was gritting his teeth, hard.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was gay porn, and I\u2019d never seen two guys together like that, and so he said if I was confused, then he could show me.\u201d Peter continued.\u00a0\u201cI asked him to stop, obviously, but he didn&rsquo;t, and I knew it was a fight I wouldn&rsquo;t win, so I kept quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d Tony murmured, then composed himself as he felt Peter brush a hand against his arm.\u00a0\u201cSorry, baby. Did you tell May? Does she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I told her and Ben pretty soon after it happened.\u201d Peter nodded.\u00a0\u201cThey were so understanding, but we couldn&rsquo;t afford to prosecute, Skip\u2019s family had money and we didn&rsquo;t, so I dealt with it, and got set up with this charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see a therapist?\u201d Tony asked, a tremor to his voice.\u00a0\u201cA proper one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn&rsquo;t afford one, Tony, not in a million years.\u201d Peter chuckled humourlessly.\u00a0\u201cI had the support that the charity gave me, and I\u2019ve done fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018m so sorry baby.\u201d Tony whispered, pressing a kiss to the top of Peter\u2019s head, breathing in the scent he knew so well.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t want your pity Tony.\u201d said Peter firmly, lifting his head to look his boyfriend in the eye.\u00a0\u201cI don&rsquo;t need pity, and I\u2019m stronger than what he did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrongest person I know.\u201d Tony agreed, brushing away a tear that had escaped down Peter\u2019s cheek.\u00a0\u201cIn every way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want people to know, though.\u201d Peter said.\u00a0\u201cI want them to know that it can happen to anyone, and that they don&rsquo;t have to keep quiet about it, and that there\u2019s help available.

I got mine down in the&nbsp;&lsquo;shop.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;On it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony watched carefully as Peter gathered his textbooks and laptop, and flashed Tony a weathered smile when he caught him staring. The older man did his best to keep his breathing steady and expression neutral as he watched Peter go, but couldn&rsquo;t help gritting his teeth, digging his nails into his palm. Someone had taken advantage of his baby, his love, when he was too young to understand what was happening or how to stop it, and the thought alone made Tony want to put his fist through a wall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eventually he relaxed enough to clear up the empty boxes on the kitchen table, emptying them into the trash before heading towards their bedroom, noting that the shower had shut off in the en suite. Tony shucked his clothes, leaving them on the floor to be whisked away by a housekeeping bot, and climbed into bed, averting his eyes from the closed bathroom door by picking up his tablet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My skin&rsquo;s so dry.&rdquo; complained Peter as he walked out of the en suite, making Tony jump slightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m<i> flaking</i>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Pepper.&rdquo; Tony grinned.&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll take you to some fancy dermatologist or something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My skin&rsquo;s dry Tony, not falling off.&rdquo; Peter deadpanned.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just need some moisturiser.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t an old man pamper his beautiful boyfriend?&rdquo; Tony pouted, then held his arms out.&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;mere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter paused, shuffling his feet, but Tony&rsquo;s cuddles were always too good to pass up, so he was crawling under the covers and wrapping himself in Tony&rsquo;s embrace before he knew what he was doing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to talk about this now.&rdquo; Tony murmured into Peter&rsquo;s still-damp hair.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna pressure anything out of you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t talk about this now, I&rsquo;ll feel like I&rsquo;m keeping something from you.&rdquo; Peter admitted.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let it rule me- it happened, and if I can&rsquo;t talk to you about it, then it&rsquo;s controlling me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; Tony nodded.</p>\n<p>Peter hesitated, grounding himself, focusing on the sensation of tony surrounding him, protecting him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was young, too young to understand what was going on, maybe eight or nine.&rdquo; Peter said, voice rough with emotion.&nbsp;&ldquo;His name was Skip, Steven actually, but everyone called him Skip. He lived in the apartment next door, and he&rsquo;d babysit me occasionally, when May and Ben had to work.&nbsp; He, uh, he showed me a porn magazine.

Did you tell May? Does she know?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I told her and Ben pretty soon after it happened.&rdquo; Peter nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;They were so understanding, but we couldn&rsquo;t afford to prosecute, Skip&rsquo;s family had money and we didn&rsquo;t, so I dealt with it, and got set up with this charity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You see a therapist?&rdquo; Tony asked, a tremor to his voice.&nbsp;&ldquo;A proper one?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t afford one, Tony, not in a million years.&rdquo; Peter chuckled humourlessly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I had the support that the charity gave me, and I&rsquo;ve done fine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m so sorry baby.&rdquo; Tony whispered, pressing a kiss to the top of Peter&rsquo;s head, breathing in the scent he knew so well.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your pity Tony.&rdquo; said Peter firmly, lifting his head to look his boyfriend in the eye.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need pity, and I&rsquo;m stronger than what he did to me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Strongest person I know.&rdquo; Tony agreed, brushing away a tear that had escaped down Peter&rsquo;s cheek.&nbsp;&ldquo;In every way possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want people to know, though.&rdquo; Peter said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want them to know that it can happen to anyone, and that they don&rsquo;t have to keep quiet about it, and that there&rsquo;s help available.

He jumped slightly as soft hands suddenly started running through his damp hair, but settled against the familiar press of Peter against his back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everything okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fine and dandy.&rdquo; Tony mumbled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t eaten solid food in a while, maybe I should do that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Thai upstairs.&rdquo; Peter said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I already ate, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if you we&rsquo;re gonna keep working.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s- yeah, that&rsquo;s great babe, thanks.&rdquo; Tony said, spinning around on his stool to press his forehead into Peter&rsquo;s stomach, hiding his face as the boy wrapped his arms around Tony&rsquo;s broad shoulders.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t- I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve been in the&nbsp;&lsquo;shop a while.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A while might be putting it mildly, you haven&rsquo;t come to bed with me for three nights.&rdquo; Peter chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that makes me happier than seeing you create, Tony, you know that, and if that means I spend some time without you, then that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re too good to me.&rdquo; Tony huffed, pulling away from Peter&rsquo;s embrace, standing to press a soft kiss against the boy&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp;&ldquo;Gotta eat before I pass out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter had already set out tubs of food for Tony when they made it back up the kitchen, and the older man nodded gratefully as he collapsed into a chair, Peter sitting opposite him, surrounded by textbooks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;M&eacute;decins sans fronti&egrave;res.&rdquo; Tony said suddenly, head snapping up to meet Peter&rsquo;s questioning look.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, Pepper wants me to choose a charity that&rsquo;s represented at some Stark Foundation gala. MSF is a good one, right? No scandals? And it&rsquo;ll be a nod to Bruce, wherever he is.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, of course.&rdquo; Peter nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tony narrowed his eyes at the hesitant tone in Peter&rsquo;s voice, the way he kept fidgeting even as he looked back down at his textbook.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Spit it out.&rdquo; Tony commanded eventually.&nbsp;&ldquo;You wanna say something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can I pick a charity?&rdquo; Peter asked, fighting to keep his voice steady.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know MSF is a great charity, obviously it is, but they&rsquo;re big, popular, get a lot of exposure already and-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Tony shrugged, digging back into his food.&nbsp;&ldquo;Got anything in mind?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s- there&rsquo;s a charity in Queens, tailored to, uhm, helping survivors of childhood sexual assault.&rdquo; Peter said, his voice rough.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;d mean a lot to me if they could get the kind of funding they deserve, that you could provide them with.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony was looking at Peter with wide eyes, plastic fork dropped to the table, forgotten as he stared at the tears in his boyfriends eyes and his suddenly pale face.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Seems like a worthy cause. I&rsquo;ll pass it on.&rdquo; Tony said eventually.&nbsp;&ldquo;Something we need to talk about, Pete?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Peter nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not- not here? Feels too much like an interview.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo; Tony agreed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna finish up here, you wanna go shower? I got mine down in the&nbsp;&lsquo;shop.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;On it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony watched carefully as Peter gathered his textbooks and laptop, and flashed Tony a weathered smile when he caught him staring. The older man did his best to keep his breathing steady and expression neutral as he watched Peter go, but couldn&rsquo;t help gritting his teeth, digging his nails into his palm. Someone had taken advantage of his baby, his love, when he was too young to understand what was happening or how to stop it, and the thought alone made Tony want to put his fist through a wall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eventually he relaxed enough to clear up the empty boxes on the kitchen table, emptying them into the trash before heading towards their bedroom, noting that the shower had shut off in the en suite. Tony shucked his clothes, leaving them on the floor to be whisked away by a housekeeping bot, and climbed into bed, averting his eyes from the closed bathroom door by picking up his tablet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My skin&rsquo;s so dry.&rdquo; complained Peter as he walked out of the en suite, making Tony jump slightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m<i> flaking</i>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Pepper.&rdquo; Tony grinned.&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll take you to some fancy dermatologist or something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My skin&rsquo;s dry Tony, not falling off.&rdquo; Peter deadpanned.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just need some moisturiser.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t an old man pamper his beautiful boyfriend?&rdquo; Tony pouted, then held his arms out.&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;mere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter paused, shuffling his feet, but Tony&rsquo;s cuddles were always too good to pass up, so he was crawling under the covers and wrapping himself in Tony&rsquo;s embrace before he knew what he was doing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to talk about this now.&rdquo; Tony murmured into Peter&rsquo;s still-damp hair.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna pressure anything out of you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t talk about this now, I&rsquo;ll feel like I&rsquo;m keeping something from you.&rdquo; Peter admitted.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let it rule me- it happened, and if I can&rsquo;t talk to you about it, then it&rsquo;s controlling me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; Tony nodded.</p>\n<p>Peter hesitated, grounding himself, focusing on the sensation of tony surrounding him, protecting him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was young, too young to understand what was going on, maybe eight or nine.&rdquo; Peter said, voice rough with emotion.&nbsp;&ldquo;His name was Skip, Steven actually, but everyone called him Skip. He lived in the apartment next door, and he&rsquo;d babysit me occasionally, when May and Ben had to work.&nbsp; He, uh, he showed me a porn magazine. I didn&rsquo;t really understand what it was.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter paused to swallow nervously, and Tony kept his hand stroking gently through the boy&rsquo;s hair, an anchor point, appearing entirely calm, except from the twitch in his jawline that betrayed he was gritting his teeth, hard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was gay porn, and I&rsquo;d never seen two guys together like that, and so he said if I was confused, then he could show me.&rdquo; Peter continued.&nbsp;&ldquo;I asked him to stop, obviously, but he didn&rsquo;t, and I knew it was a fight I wouldn&rsquo;t win, so I kept quiet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Son of a bitch.&rdquo; Tony murmured, then composed himself as he felt Peter brush a hand against his arm.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, baby. Did you tell May? Does she know?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I told her and Ben pretty soon after it happened.&rdquo; Peter nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;They were so understanding, but we couldn&rsquo;t afford to prosecute, Skip&rsquo;s family had money and we didn&rsquo;t, so I dealt with it, and got set up with this charity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You see a therapist?&rdquo; Tony asked, a tremor to his voice.&nbsp;&ldquo;A proper one?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t afford one, Tony, not in a million years.&rdquo; Peter chuckled humourlessly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I had the support that the charity gave me, and I&rsquo;ve done fine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m so sorry baby.&rdquo; Tony whispered, pressing a kiss to the top of Peter&rsquo;s head, breathing in the scent he knew so well.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your pity Tony.&rdquo; said Peter firmly, lifting his head to look his boyfriend in the eye.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need pity, and I&rsquo;m stronger than what he did to me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Strongest person I know.&rdquo; Tony agreed, brushing away a tear that had escaped down Peter&rsquo;s cheek.&nbsp;&ldquo;In every way possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want people to know, though.&rdquo; Peter said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want them to know that it can happen to anyone, and that they don&rsquo;t have to keep quiet about it, and that there&rsquo;s help available. I want people to know they&rsquo;re not on their own.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jesus christ, Peter.&rdquo; Tony sighed, almost reverently.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re willing to take it public?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to help people, Tony. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve ever wanted.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

It\u2019s an absolute gem. Literally, the only reason that I don\u2019t give it a full ten is the fact that it ends. I could easily read another 300k of this AU.</p><p>There\u2019s the classic premise here that I have come across before - Tony is a merman in the aquarium, Bucky is the janitor. And yet there\u2019s so much more to this fic than the usual - it\u2019s one of a kind.\u00a0</p><p>And on top of that, there\u2019s Stan Lee. It\u2019s everything you wish from a fic.</p><!-- more --><p>Here\u2019s one thing for a start - I wasn\u2019t quite sure how this fic would read at first, because the narrative here is non-linear. It jumps between early days in their relationship and what is the current events which initially slightly put me off because I wasn\u2019t sure how that will work.</p><p>But it does work, and it works amazingly.</p><p>The thing is, that sort of vinette style perfectly showcases\u00a0the development of their relationship in a way linear narrative wouldn\u2019t quite achieve the same way. It\u2019s perfectly executed in a way that doesn\u2019t confuse the reader but adds just the right dynamic.</p><p>On top of that, the story is deliciously fresh. There are classic tropes here but taken on in a new way, fresh elements like Bucky being an empath or&hellip; Tony. Nothing in particular about Tony - more Tony in general.\u00a0</p><p>Tony\u2019s characterization here is truly the best part of the fic. It\u2019s completely on point, capturing his essence, while also deliciously surprising. There\u2019s Tony\u2019s arc reactor but now in a way one would expect it.\u00a0</p><p>The events progress in a way that puts a twist on a classic. Tony\u2019s reactions are part of that, Tony\u2019s captivity, in its strange way it appears in this fic (watch me try not to spoiler while explaining) is another.</p><p>It\u2019s that fic you try to find, a fic done a thousand times, but done in a way that makes you feel like you just discovered the trope. A worthy read.</p>",

This is the second \npart of what\u2019s shaping up to be a legit trilogy (the first is <a href=\"https://wickednerdery.tumblr.com/post/177555139479/ice-burns-and-it-is-hard-to-the-warm-skinned-to\">FrostBitten</a>) - <a href=\"https://wickednerdery.tumblr.com/post/181111149204/the-snake-that-cannot-shed-its-skin-perishes\">the master list is here</a>. The story on whole is gonna be <b>very</b> <b>dark</b>,\n this piece itself - which starts Thor\u2019s main story - is actually tame\n aside from some yelling, cursing, and poor Thor moments.\nStill, for consistency and length, it gets a \u201cRead More\u201d.</p><!-- more --><p><i>It is Odin who tricks Thor away from his brother, leaving Loki unprotected and easily taken. It is Odin who induces forgetfulness and spreads it through Asgard like a poison. The king works his magic to make it grow so that throughout the realms, in time, Loki might be forgotten completely. Like Hela before his adopted son would become nothing but a story, a mere fantasy; no one and nothing true. Odin would put distance between himself, his family, and his unfortunate error once again to save his pride and crown.</i></p><p><i>By the time Thor returns to the rock there is nothing there but smashed rubble and the faint sense of urgency. He\u2019d come to the edge of the grounds for some reason, an important task, but the answers are all behind a fog. Earnest eyes scan for answers, for questions, something beyond kicked up and bloodied dirt. </i></p><p><i>His mother\u2019s lullaby hits his ears and he turns back, up, to the palace. With placid face and knowing smile Frigga hums and, as Thor watches her, she changes before him. Deep blue dress turns green and gold. Long blond hair smooths into shoulder-length black and her whole form changes. The woman looks wholly recognizable, yet Thor cannot place the man she\u2019s become. \u201cYou must find him, Thor. Save your brother. Protect Loki.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLoki&hellip;\u201d Thor repeats the name heard only in his mind; it feels right. Real. He looks around, as if he might find this Loki nearby, before looking back up to catch sight of his mother walking back into the palace. \u201cLoki&hellip;.Loki&hellip;Loki&hellip;\u201d The god repeats the name over and over, keeping it foremost in his mind, as he hurries to Heimdall\u2019s observatory. \u201cI must find a Loki, what can you see, Heimdall?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The man narrows his eyes, ticks head slightly. \u201cLoki? I\u2019m afraid I do not know this word. Is it a person or item?\u201d If he has a clearer idea of what he\u2019s looking for, perhaps he can find it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI&hellip;\u201d Thor clung to the name, but forgot its meaning. He tries to recall his mother (this Loki is tied to her, is it not?), then smiles. \u201cI believe it is a being.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Heimdall nods, closes eyes to concentrate, but there is nothing. Only tenuous threads he cannot weave into anything substantial and even those fray before his very mind\u2019s eye. \u201cI am sorry, Thor, but I can find nothing.\u201d It was so very usual, very strange. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s something to do with your time on Midgard?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c&hellip;Perhaps&hellip;\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cShall I send you there in search of answers and this lost&hellip;thing.\u201d Heimdall himself\u2019s already forgotten what they\u2019re in search for.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, I shall go to Stark\u2019s.\u201d He cannot say why he picks Tony except he\u2019s the smartest man Thor knows of on Midgard. And, if this&hellip;Loki&hellip;was a dangerous thing Tony would most certainly be prepared and ready for battle beside him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well, my prince, I shall send you directly,\u201d Heimdall bows his head and, in a moment\u2019s flash, Thor is at the end of Stark\u2019s long landing pad at The Avenger\u2019s Tower.</i></p><p><i>Not even leaving his lands can stop the disintegration of Thor\u2019s memory though; not even reaching Midgard can protect him from his own father\u2019s magic. By the time he reaches Stark, lounging on a deck chair, his face\u2019s fallen to confusion. &hellip;What has he come to ask again?</i></p><p><i>Tony\u2019s brows rise in alarm, then fall in the wait for Thor to speak. \u201cYou alright there, Point Break?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my friend.\u201d Thor knows he needs help, but the reason, the trouble, is fogged from him. It\u2019s something distant, unattainable, but very true and very real. \u201cI&hellip;I came to request your aid&hellip;only now I\u2019ve forgotten why.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you came here to ask for my help&hellip;\u201d Tony\u2019s stands, examines his friend more closely. \u201cBut can\u2019t remember with what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I cannot,\u201d Thor confesses with a sigh, running hand through hair, twisting hammer in the other. He can remember years, centuries. He has a god\u2019s memory, how can he forget something he is certain recently occurred?!<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cYou hit your head on the Bifrost or something?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Eyes fall to despair. \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUh&hellip;.huh&hellip;\u201d He didn\u2019t think gods could get amnesia, yet here was Thor, a god, standing all amnesiac before him. \u201cLook, buddy, how \u2018bout we go inside, have a drink, and see if we can\u2019t figure this out, yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well, my friend.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony lets Thor follow as his mind begins to gather what little facts there are and formulate theories. Whatever is going on, it\u2019s powerful enough to mess with a god\u2019s mind. That said, Thor seems of sound mind and, potentially, with solid recall aside from whatever he needs help with. So what are they looking at here? Injury? Infection? Something else entirely? Tony skips the bar in the penthouse for the one down in his workshop and let\u2019s Thor settle on a nearby chair as he pours for both of them - definitely need a drink or two before opening whatever can of worms this is.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI adjusted the coding and cleared out the spare bugs from your latest suit, Stark.\u201d The voice itself is almost robotic, but Thor sees clearly the being is flesh and blood. Back to them, hunkering down over a series of computers, he catches feminine eyes in the reflection of one of the screens. \u201cThat Thor?\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony tips back his first drink, pours his second, as Thor takes his first. \u201cLynk, this is Thor, Thor,\u201d he points to the person\u2019s back. \u201cLynk with a Y&hellip;my tech assistant.\u201d Pepper will always run most of his stuff, but Lynk has certain, unique, abilities that makes her utterly invaluable to him in his work.</i></p><p><i>Thor smiles. \u201cGreetings, fair maid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah&hellip;No.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor\u2019s face falls. \u201cNo?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lips lift, but focus remains on the computers. \u201cI\u2019m not a fair maid, Mr Odinson. I\u2019m just Lynk.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou may call me Thor, if you wish.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay then, Thor. I\u2019m still Lynk.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>Thor looks to Tony, unsure, but Tony just shrugs and finishes his second drink. \u201cOkay, so this thing you need help with&hellip;\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLet\u2019s do process of elimination.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt have anything to do with Earth?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c&hellip;Not directly, I don\u2019t believe&hellip;\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAsgard then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou personally?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026I&hellip;in a way, perhaps?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFamily maybe?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor\u2019s pause is especially long, his heart and mind arguing for an accurate answer. \u201cI&hellip;I believe so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cParents?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey are not the issue&hellip;but maybe connected to it?\u201d His mother turned into it, hadn\u2019t she? Yes, yes she had, but&hellip;but Thor cannot recall what she\u2019d turned into anymore.<br/></i></p><p><i>Tony sighs, now presuming the whole thing a giant waffling by the god. \u201cFuck. if it\u2019s Loki just say so, Thor. I\u2019m still unlikely to help, but at least I\u2019d admire the boldness of asking directly.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWha-? Who&hellip;Who is&hellip;Loki?\u201d And why did it sound so familiar and yet not at the same time?</i></p><p><i>\u201cLoki, also known as Loki Laufeyson or Loki Odinson, is the God of Mischief and listed as a top-tier intergalactic terrorist by S.H.I.E.L.D.. His attempts to take over Earth resulted in the destruction of Manhattan and countless deaths. Captured by The Avengers Initiative he was turned over to his brother, Thor Odinson, God of Thunder, to be returned to Asgard where his punishment would be set by the King of Asgard, Odin Allfather.\u201d The young woman\u2019s turned to them both, face showing a mix of concern and interest. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember your own brother?\u201d</i></p><p><i>She is slight, pale, with spiked, jet black, hair and many bits of metal in her face&hellip;Thor cannot recall seeing another like her on Midgard. He smiles in spite of his current predicament. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf him,\u201d Lynk clarifies. \u201cI was lecturing in Boston when he came to New York, but I watched the news. Question is, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Loki himself doing this?\u201d Tony offers. \u201cIt\u2019s not beyond him, right? Take out his brother, escape, rally some troops, come back at Earth again.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re making assumptions without basis,\u201d she counters flatly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy basis is I know the guy. I\u2019ve seen what he can do, first hand.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy give his brother amnesia then send him in your direction?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDistraction? Shits and giggles? How should I know.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>Lynk\u2019s eyes switch to Thor. \u201cWe need more data.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor has no issue with basic or advanced memory tests, brain scans show no clear injury or disease, and nothing can be found in his blood that would suggest a cause for his amnesia. Both Tony and Lynk remain stuck, unsure what to test for next, as Thor lays on the table looking up at both of them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo we know why I\u2019ve forgotten what I\u2019ve forgotten?\u201d Again Loki\u2019s existence has slipped from his mind, but not the urgency of the need to help, to get help.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony sighs; Thor frowns deeply. \u201cBut I\u2019m starting to guess some kind of magic, which leads us back to Loki.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure you actually need help, Thor? Or do you just&hellip;feel like you need it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need help, of that I\u2019m certain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lynk looks down. \u201cWith&hellip;or for&hellip;your brother, Loki, yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The fog thickens. \u201cI\u2026cannot recall.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony rolls eyes in frustration, convinced this is some elaborate trick by the <i>God of Mischief</i>. He wants no part of it; better to hunker down, fortify, with backup plans for when Loki\u2019s true scheme is ultimately revealed. <i>\u201cThis is probably all just a big fucking hoax.\u201d </i><br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is not a hoax!\u201d Thor flies up, roars his own frustration, as sparks crack across the metal table. The need to accomplish a goal he cannot recall has settled deep and sure in his heart even if his mind continues to betray him.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cWoah, hey there!\u201d Tony\u2019s thumb discreetly goes to his suit\u2019s activation button as he and Lynk both jump back. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re tricking me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou think another is tricking us all,\u201d Thor states firmly, hammer held out as if ready to crash. \u201cI am not a fool, Stark, I know my own heart!\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI might know someone who can help, Thor,\u201d Lynk speaks up quickly, hoping to both placate and distract as she feels the machines around them shiver with the herself and Tony.<br/></i></p><p><i>The storm in the god dies and he turns as hope blooms once more. \u201cTruly?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe might be able to figure out what you can\u2019t remember or, at the very least, maybe why you can\u2019t remember.\u201d She looks to Tony, who\u2019s finally beginning to breathe again. \u201cIf it\u2019s a trick by Loki, then you might know what he\u2019s up to and, if it\u2019s not&hellip;\u201d She smiles at Thor. \u201cThen maybe we\u2019ll know how to help.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Honest trouble or not, Tony had no interest in helping Loki. He still woke up in the middle of night, sweaty and short of breath, thanks to that asshole. Best not to piss of his friend, the god, though. \u201cSure, if you know someone who\u2019s willing. Can\u2019t hurt to try, right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRight.\u201d <br/></i></p><p><i>Thor grins. \u201cTake me to him now, fair Lynk.\u201d</i></p><hr><p>I legit feel bad writing Thor like this&hellip;in part because I know he already gets a bad wrap as sorta being the \u201cslow on the uptake\u201d one and I don\u2019t think he is. That said, Odin\u2019s clouding his - and everyone else in Asgard\u2019s - mind from remembering Loki so it\u2019s not like I can have Thor just putting it all together, haha! Frigga only does because she\u2019s very powerful in magic herself. Lynk is a mutant - though there\u2019s only a hint of her powers shown in this - and will be important to Thor going forward so&hellip;hope you like, lol!\u00a0 (And, damn, I\u2019m prod of myself for getting two out relatively quick after the holidays so go me, haha! ^_^)<br/></p><p>(Gifs found on Google, then combined by me)<br/></p><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m562BH6RQ5p1d3IRn8j3sTA\">@succumb-to-your-king</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mini5uVfVCqBnof0UcwKFJg\">@chibiyanai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miYmuQ-J2lFCJzvNBxKx0Hw\">@wadeyouwitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT4Wa9BOYReycCN_SaAP7_w\">@creedslove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtlDymZJwJfOBhN1P2Pvpqw\">@lady-crowned-with-stars</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBOzTtetGwL8iED5FFWOJtQ\">@moonfaery</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdkbFGMEEnpvO8qSZp2Bakg\">@annievvv7</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqxcLrhKq5EFwpoXjuy9geQ\">@ladyfluff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhHZpL_BA2bH8iRamjXekuQ\">@holykryptonitekitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\">@lokilvrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqnFBJpOxEEzJ-6N-nMA5RQ\">@janebrownnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Q4_fndLPWyaeqfi2R900g\">@lokis-little-kitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfKM89wIdWJspJl0ev7I9kg\">@alexakeyloveloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms1sYijQULo7X0I4ePUXBTw\">@theangelsfightwithdevils</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP6kpQuXZzu4oCd80sHXb0w\">@the-blue-tiefling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO6txStxBzKpnFKzLKJG7Xw\">@lokis-lady-death</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjgs5OcuMkKrs4_MAVIf6Sg\">@dangertoozmanykids101</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz-vKKclAh0OX23Y8XKK0KQ\">@prometheasmother</a> <strike>@</strike><a href=\"https://vethrvolnir.tumblr.com/\"><strike>vethrvolnir </strike> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQZ0wfg0mTTVA8Ydv3NSC0Q\">@wintertink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqOGfTW0AeSA1n8vLZ7u_Lw\">@amethyst-dreams-and-candy-canes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxdrHNYrR7AjkvtLqnGgSA\">@drakonwild</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhAZmv5DVlbw1aJ6DuY58dg\">@starscreamloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCJGlnPT_YJLLW8d4Dt_9dQ\">@judas-nipples</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZJzmZri8iN5RYQQSnTzdA\">@hiddles-rose</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB1uFR4WcIvHHys6f_N7Yw\">@the-lady-witchitery</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3z8elk82Qi-xJ8B2OajTPQ\">@galaxies-inside-my-head</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz4i80zhRtPdGm3DCoCUTdA\">@<strike>jackheart180</strike></a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrgFaNxE_mV5BXAkrrrMKEA\">@lukeevansandjdmobession</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnb_XX1op8KKmoee2KeLYYg\">@endlessstairway</a><a> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmmZaK6kcvIAdonOCB3xQw\">@lanabanana-86</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZxmk80GDzS_j-u2EUWA_Rg\">@tom-fucking-hiddleston-1981</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma0bDQc4uSYsb9iD5yMTbHA\">@lovekrystina</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvqK4xvxjvq42TaYRP1L8jA\">@madoka73</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR4YJ4CxLZyLvGa4GTNJYQg\">@lokikingofasgardslover713</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m78sYG--AeQ4JjclpZYTuPA\">@partiallyinthecloset</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr7Wx1TKgUZ1IeCTLjIRd4Q\">@ultrarebelheart</a> \u00a0<strike>@gravitational-anomaly</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4K7iutRt0ib7aTV7pIHBIw\">@manip-loki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzF0cO2L9q5hgKl28V6ud2Q\">@my-world-of-imagines</a> @<strike>lowcarbgem</strike>\u00a0 \u2026Think that\u2019s everyone from FrostBitten, if you want on or off, just \nlemme know!

It is Odin who induces forgetfulness and spreads it through Asgard like a poison. The king works his magic to make it grow so that throughout the realms, in time, Loki might be forgotten completely. Like Hela before his adopted son would become nothing but a story, a mere fantasy; no one and nothing true. Odin would put distance between himself, his family, and his unfortunate error once again to save his pride and crown.</i></p><p><i>By the time Thor returns to the rock there is nothing there but smashed rubble and the faint sense of urgency. He\u2019d come to the edge of the grounds for some reason, an important task, but the answers are all behind a fog. Earnest eyes scan for answers, for questions, something beyond kicked up and bloodied dirt. </i></p><p><i>His mother\u2019s lullaby hits his ears and he turns back, up, to the palace. With placid face and knowing smile Frigga hums and, as Thor watches her, she changes before him. Deep blue dress turns green and gold. Long blond hair smooths into shoulder-length black and her whole form changes. The woman looks wholly recognizable, yet Thor cannot place the man she\u2019s become. \u201cYou must find him, Thor. Save your brother. Protect Loki.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLoki\u2026\u201d Thor repeats the name heard only in his mind; it feels right. Real. He looks around, as if he might find this Loki nearby, before looking back up to catch sight of his mother walking back into the palace. \u201cLoki\u2026.Loki\u2026Loki\u2026\u201d The god repeats the name over and over, keeping it foremost in his mind, as he hurries to Heimdall\u2019s observatory. \u201cI must find a Loki, what can you see, Heimdall?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The man narrows his eyes, ticks head slightly. \u201cLoki? I\u2019m afraid I do not know this word. Is it a person or item?\u201d If he has a clearer idea of what he\u2019s looking for, perhaps he can find it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Thor clung to the name, but forgot its meaning. He tries to recall his mother (this Loki is tied to her, is it not?), then smiles. \u201cI believe it is a being.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Heimdall nods, closes eyes to concentrate, but there is nothing. Only tenuous threads he cannot weave into anything substantial and even those fray before his very mind\u2019s eye. \u201cI am sorry, Thor, but I can find nothing.\u201d It was so very usual, very strange. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s something to do with your time on Midgard?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026Perhaps\u2026\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cShall I send you there in search of answers and this lost\u2026thing.\u201d Heimdall himself\u2019s already forgotten what they\u2019re in search for.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, I shall go to Stark\u2019s.\u201d He cannot say why he picks Tony except he\u2019s the smartest man Thor knows of on Midgard. And, if this\u2026Loki\u2026was a dangerous thing Tony would most certainly be prepared and ready for battle beside him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well, my prince, I shall send you directly,\u201d Heimdall bows his head and, in a moment\u2019s flash, Thor is at the end of Stark\u2019s long landing pad at The Avenger\u2019s Tower.</i></p><p><i>Not even leaving his lands can stop the disintegration of Thor\u2019s memory though; not even reaching Midgard can protect him from his own father\u2019s magic. By the time he reaches Stark, lounging on a deck chair, his face\u2019s fallen to confusion. \u2026What has he come to ask again?</i></p><p><i>Tony\u2019s brows rise in alarm, then fall in the wait for Thor to speak. \u201cYou alright there, Point Break?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my friend.\u201d Thor knows he needs help, but the reason, the trouble, is fogged from him. It\u2019s something distant, unattainable, but very true and very real. \u201cI\u2026I came to request your aid\u2026only now I\u2019ve forgotten why.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you came here to ask for my help\u2026\u201d Tony\u2019s stands, examines his friend more closely. \u201cBut can\u2019t remember with what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI cannot,\u201d Thor confesses with a sigh, running hand through hair, twisting hammer in the other. He can remember years, centuries. He has a god\u2019s memory, how can he forget something he is certain recently occurred?!<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYou hit your head on the Bifrost or something?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Eyes fall to despair. \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUh\u2026.huh\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t think gods could get amnesia, yet here was Thor, a god, standing all amnesiac before him. \u201cLook, buddy, how \u2018bout we go inside, have a drink, and see if we can\u2019t figure this out, yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well, my friend.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony lets Thor follow as his mind begins to gather what little facts there are and formulate theories. Whatever is going on, it\u2019s powerful enough to mess with a god\u2019s mind. That said, Thor seems of sound mind and, potentially, with solid recall aside from whatever he needs help with. So what are they looking at here? Injury? Infection? Something else entirely? Tony skips the bar in the penthouse for the one down in his workshop and let\u2019s Thor settle on a nearby chair as he pours for both of them - definitely need a drink or two before opening whatever can of worms this is.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI adjusted the coding and cleared out the spare bugs from your latest suit, Stark.\u201d The voice itself is almost robotic, but Thor sees clearly the being is flesh and blood. Back to them, hunkering down over a series of computers, he catches feminine eyes in the reflection of one of the screens. \u201cThat Thor?\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony tips back his first drink, pours his second, as Thor takes his first. \u201cLynk, this is Thor, Thor,\u201d he points to the person\u2019s back. \u201cLynk with a Y\u2026my tech assistant.\u201d Pepper will always run most of his stuff, but Lynk has certain, unique, abilities that makes her utterly invaluable to him in his work.</i></p><p><i>Thor smiles. \u201cGreetings, fair maid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah\u2026No.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor\u2019s face falls. \u201cNo?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lips lift, but focus remains on the computers. \u201cI\u2019m not a fair maid, Mr Odinson. I\u2019m just Lynk.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou may call me Thor, if you wish.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay then, Thor. I\u2019m still Lynk.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>Thor looks to Tony, unsure, but Tony just shrugs and finishes his second drink. \u201cOkay, so this thing you need help with\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLet\u2019s do process of elimination.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt have anything to do with Earth?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026Not directly, I don\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAsgard then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou personally?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026I\u2026in a way, perhaps?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFamily maybe?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor\u2019s pause is especially long, his heart and mind arguing for an accurate answer. \u201cI\u2026I believe so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cParents?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey are not the issue\u2026but maybe connected to it?\u201d His mother turned into it, hadn\u2019t she? Yes, yes she had, but\u2026but Thor cannot recall what she\u2019d turned into anymore.<br></i></p><p><i>Tony sighs, now presuming the whole thing a giant waffling by the god. \u201cFuck. if it\u2019s Loki just say so, Thor. I\u2019m still unlikely to help, but at least I\u2019d admire the boldness of asking directly.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWha-? Who\u2026Who is\u2026Loki?\u201d And why did it sound so familiar and yet not at the same time?</i></p><p><i>\u201cLoki, also known as Loki Laufeyson or Loki Odinson, is the God of Mischief and listed as a top-tier intergalactic terrorist by S.H.I.E.L.D.. His attempts to take over Earth resulted in the destruction of Manhattan and countless deaths. Captured by The Avengers Initiative he was turned over to his brother, Thor Odinson, God of Thunder, to be returned to Asgard where his punishment would be set by the King of Asgard, Odin Allfather.\u201d The young woman\u2019s turned to them both, face showing a mix of concern and interest. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember your own brother?\u201d</i></p><p><i>She is slight, pale, with spiked, jet black, hair and many bits of metal in her face\u2026Thor cannot recall seeing another like her on Midgard. He smiles in spite of his current predicament. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf him,\u201d Lynk clarifies. \u201cI was lecturing in Boston when he came to New York, but I watched the news. Question is, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Loki himself doing this?\u201d Tony offers. \u201cIt\u2019s not beyond him, right? Take out his brother, escape, rally some troops, come back at Earth again.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re making assumptions without basis,\u201d she counters flatly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy basis is I know the guy. I\u2019ve seen what he can do, first hand.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy give his brother amnesia then send him in your direction?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDistraction? Shits and giggles? How should I know.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>Lynk\u2019s eyes switch to Thor. \u201cWe need more data.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor has no issue with basic or advanced memory tests, brain scans show no clear injury or disease, and nothing can be found in his blood that would suggest a cause for his amnesia. Both Tony and Lynk remain stuck, unsure what to test for next, as Thor lays on the table looking up at both of them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo we know why I\u2019ve forgotten what I\u2019ve forgotten?\u201d Again Loki\u2019s existence has slipped from his mind, but not the urgency of the need to help, to get help.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony sighs; Thor frowns deeply. \u201cBut I\u2019m starting to guess some kind of magic, which leads us back to Loki.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure you actually need help, Thor? Or do you just\u2026feel like you need it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need help, of that I\u2019m certain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lynk looks down. \u201cWith\u2026or for\u2026your brother, Loki, yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The fog thickens. \u201cI\u2026cannot recall.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony rolls eyes in frustration, convinced this is some elaborate trick by the <i>God of Mischief</i>. He wants no part of it; better to hunker down, fortify, with backup plans for when Loki\u2019s true scheme is ultimately revealed. <i>\u201cThis is probably all just a big fucking hoax.\u201d </i><br></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is not a hoax!\u201d Thor flies up, roars his own frustration, as sparks crack across the metal table. The need to accomplish a goal he cannot recall has settled deep and sure in his heart even if his mind continues to betray him.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWoah, hey there!\u201d Tony\u2019s thumb discreetly goes to his suit\u2019s activation button as he and Lynk both jump back. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re tricking me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou think another is tricking us all,\u201d Thor states firmly, hammer held out as if ready to crash. \u201cI am not a fool, Stark, I know my own heart!\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI might know someone who can help, Thor,\u201d Lynk speaks up quickly, hoping to both placate and distract as she feels the machines around them shiver with the herself and Tony.<br></i></p><p><i>The storm in the god dies and he turns as hope blooms once more. \u201cTruly?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe might be able to figure out what you can\u2019t remember or, at the very least, maybe why you can\u2019t remember.\u201d She looks to Tony, who\u2019s finally beginning to breathe again. \u201cIf it\u2019s a trick by Loki, then you might know what he\u2019s up to and, if it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d She smiles at Thor. \u201cThen maybe we\u2019ll know how to help.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Honest trouble or not, Tony had no interest in helping Loki. He still woke up in the middle of night, sweaty and short of breath, thanks to that asshole. Best not to piss of his friend, the god, though. \u201cSure, if you know someone who\u2019s willing. Can\u2019t hurt to try, right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRight.\u201d <br></i></p><p><i>Thor grins. \u201cTake me to him now, fair Lynk.\u201d</i></p><hr><p>I legit feel bad writing Thor like this\u2026in part because I know he already gets a bad wrap as sorta being the \u201cslow on the uptake\u201d one and I don\u2019t think he is. That said, Odin\u2019s clouding his - and everyone else in Asgard\u2019s - mind from remembering Loki so it\u2019s not like I can have Thor just putting it all together, haha! Frigga only does because she\u2019s very powerful in magic herself. Lynk is a mutant - though there\u2019s only a hint of her powers shown in this - and will be important to Thor going forward so\u2026hope you like, lol!\u00a0 (And, damn, I\u2019m prod of myself for getting two out relatively quick after the holidays so go me, haha! ^_^)<br></p><p>(Gifs found on Google, then combined by me)<br></p><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m562BH6RQ5p1d3IRn8j3sTA\">@succumb-to-your-king</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mini5uVfVCqBnof0UcwKFJg\">@chibiyanai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miYmuQ-J2lFCJzvNBxKx0Hw\">@wadeyouwitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT4Wa9BOYReycCN_SaAP7_w\">@creedslove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtlDymZJwJfOBhN1P2Pvpqw\">@lady-crowned-with-stars</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBOzTtetGwL8iED5FFWOJtQ\">@moonfaery</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdkbFGMEEnpvO8qSZp2Bakg\">@annievvv7</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqxcLrhKq5EFwpoXjuy9geQ\">@ladyfluff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhHZpL_BA2bH8iRamjXekuQ\">@holykryptonitekitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\">@lokilvrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqnFBJpOxEEzJ-6N-nMA5RQ\">@janebrownnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Q4_fndLPWyaeqfi2R900g\">@lokis-little-kitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfKM89wIdWJspJl0ev7I9kg\">@alexakeyloveloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms1sYijQULo7X0I4ePUXBTw\">@theangelsfightwithdevils</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP6kpQuXZzu4oCd80sHXb0w\">@the-blue-tiefling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO6txStxBzKpnFKzLKJG7Xw\">@lokis-lady-death</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjgs5OcuMkKrs4_MAVIf6Sg\">@dangertoozmanykids101</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz-vKKclAh0OX23Y8XKK0KQ\">@prometheasmother</a> <strike>@</strike><a href=\"https://vethrvolnir.tumblr.com/\"><strike>vethrvolnir </strike> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQZ0wfg0mTTVA8Ydv3NSC0Q\">@wintertink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqOGfTW0AeSA1n8vLZ7u_Lw\">@amethyst-dreams-and-candy-canes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxdrHNYrR7AjkvtLqnGgSA\">@drakonwild</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhAZmv5DVlbw1aJ6DuY58dg\">@starscreamloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCJGlnPT_YJLLW8d4Dt_9dQ\">@judas-nipples</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZJzmZri8iN5RYQQSnTzdA\">@hiddles-rose</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB1uFR4WcIvHHys6f_N7Yw\">@the-lady-witchitery</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3z8elk82Qi-xJ8B2OajTPQ\">@galaxies-inside-my-head</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz4i80zhRtPdGm3DCoCUTdA\">@<strike>jackheart180</strike></a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrgFaNxE_mV5BXAkrrrMKEA\">@lukeevansandjdmobession</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnb_XX1op8KKmoee2KeLYYg\">@endlessstairway</a><a> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmmZaK6kcvIAdonOCB3xQw\">@lanabanana-86</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZxmk80GDzS_j-u2EUWA_Rg\">@tom-fucking-hiddleston-1981</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma0bDQc4uSYsb9iD5yMTbHA\">@lovekrystina</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvqK4xvxjvq42TaYRP1L8jA\">@madoka73</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR4YJ4CxLZyLvGa4GTNJYQg\">@lokikingofasgardslover713</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m78sYG--AeQ4JjclpZYTuPA\">@partiallyinthecloset</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr7Wx1TKgUZ1IeCTLjIRd4Q\">@ultrarebelheart</a> \u00a0<strike>@gravitational-anomaly</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4K7iutRt0ib7aTV7pIHBIw\">@manip-loki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzF0cO2L9q5hgKl28V6ud2Q\">@my-world-of-imagines</a> @<strike>lowcarbgem</strike>\u00a0 \u2026Think that\u2019s everyone from FrostBitten, if you want on or off, just \nlemme know!

It is Odin who induces forgetfulness and spreads it through Asgard like a poison. The king works his magic to make it grow so that throughout the realms, in time, Loki might be forgotten completely. Like Hela before his adopted son would become nothing but a story, a mere fantasy; no one and nothing true. Odin would put distance between himself, his family, and his unfortunate error once again to save his pride and crown.</i></p><p><i>By the time Thor returns to the rock there is nothing there but smashed rubble and the faint sense of urgency. He\u2019d come to the edge of the grounds for some reason, an important task, but the answers are all behind a fog. Earnest eyes scan for answers, for questions, something beyond kicked up and bloodied dirt. </i></p><p><i>His mother\u2019s lullaby hits his ears and he turns back, up, to the palace. With placid face and knowing smile Frigga hums and, as Thor watches her, she changes before him. Deep blue dress turns green and gold. Long blond hair smooths into shoulder-length black and her whole form changes. The woman looks wholly recognizable, yet Thor cannot place the man she\u2019s become. \u201cYou must find him, Thor. Save your brother. Protect Loki.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLoki\u2026\u201d Thor repeats the name heard only in his mind; it feels right. Real. He looks around, as if he might find this Loki nearby, before looking back up to catch sight of his mother walking back into the palace. \u201cLoki\u2026.Loki\u2026Loki\u2026\u201d The god repeats the name over and over, keeping it foremost in his mind, as he hurries to Heimdall\u2019s observatory. \u201cI must find a Loki, what can you see, Heimdall?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The man narrows his eyes, ticks head slightly. \u201cLoki? I\u2019m afraid I do not know this word. Is it a person or item?\u201d If he has a clearer idea of what he\u2019s looking for, perhaps he can find it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Thor clung to the name, but forgot its meaning. He tries to recall his mother (this Loki is tied to her, is it not?), then smiles. \u201cI believe it is a being.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Heimdall nods, closes eyes to concentrate, but there is nothing. Only tenuous threads he cannot weave into anything substantial and even those fray before his very mind\u2019s eye. \u201cI am sorry, Thor, but I can find nothing.\u201d It was so very usual, very strange. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s something to do with your time on Midgard?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026Perhaps\u2026\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cShall I send you there in search of answers and this lost\u2026thing.\u201d Heimdall himself\u2019s already forgotten what they\u2019re in search for.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, I shall go to Stark\u2019s.\u201d He cannot say why he picks Tony except he\u2019s the smartest man Thor knows of on Midgard. And, if this\u2026Loki\u2026was a dangerous thing Tony would most certainly be prepared and ready for battle beside him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well, my prince, I shall send you directly,\u201d Heimdall bows his head and, in a moment\u2019s flash, Thor is at the end of Stark\u2019s long landing pad at The Avenger\u2019s Tower.</i></p><p><i>Not even leaving his lands can stop the disintegration of Thor\u2019s memory though; not even reaching Midgard can protect him from his own father\u2019s magic. By the time he reaches Stark, lounging on a deck chair, his face\u2019s fallen to confusion. \u2026What has he come to ask again?</i></p><p><i>Tony\u2019s brows rise in alarm, then fall in the wait for Thor to speak. \u201cYou alright there, Point Break?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my friend.\u201d Thor knows he needs help, but the reason, the trouble, is fogged from him. It\u2019s something distant, unattainable, but very true and very real. \u201cI\u2026I came to request your aid\u2026only now I\u2019ve forgotten why.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you came here to ask for my help\u2026\u201d Tony\u2019s stands, examines his friend more closely. \u201cBut can\u2019t remember with what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI cannot,\u201d Thor confesses with a sigh, running hand through hair, twisting hammer in the other. He can remember years, centuries. He has a god\u2019s memory, how can he forget something he is certain recently occurred?!<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYou hit your head on the Bifrost or something?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Eyes fall to despair. \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUh\u2026.huh\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t think gods could get amnesia, yet here was Thor, a god, standing all amnesiac before him. \u201cLook, buddy, how \u2018bout we go inside, have a drink, and see if we can\u2019t figure this out, yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well, my friend.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony lets Thor follow as his mind begins to gather what little facts there are and formulate theories. Whatever is going on, it\u2019s powerful enough to mess with a god\u2019s mind. That said, Thor seems of sound mind and, potentially, with solid recall aside from whatever he needs help with. So what are they looking at here? Injury? Infection? Something else entirely? Tony skips the bar in the penthouse for the one down in his workshop and let\u2019s Thor settle on a nearby chair as he pours for both of them - definitely need a drink or two before opening whatever can of worms this is.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI adjusted the coding and cleared out the spare bugs from your latest suit, Stark.\u201d The voice itself is almost robotic, but Thor sees clearly the being is flesh and blood. Back to them, hunkering down over a series of computers, he catches feminine eyes in the reflection of one of the screens. \u201cThat Thor?\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony tips back his first drink, pours his second, as Thor takes his first. \u201cLynk, this is Thor, Thor,\u201d he points to the person\u2019s back. \u201cLynk with a Y\u2026my tech assistant.\u201d Pepper will always run most of his stuff, but Lynk has certain, unique, abilities that makes her utterly invaluable to him in his work.</i></p><p><i>Thor smiles. \u201cGreetings, fair maid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah\u2026No.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor\u2019s face falls. \u201cNo?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lips lift, but focus remains on the computers. \u201cI\u2019m not a fair maid, Mr Odinson. I\u2019m just Lynk.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou may call me Thor, if you wish.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay then, Thor. I\u2019m still Lynk.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>Thor looks to Tony, unsure, but Tony just shrugs and finishes his second drink. \u201cOkay, so this thing you need help with\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLet\u2019s do process of elimination.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVery well.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt have anything to do with Earth?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026Not directly, I don\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAsgard then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou personally?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026I\u2026in a way, perhaps?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFamily maybe?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor\u2019s pause is especially long, his heart and mind arguing for an accurate answer. \u201cI\u2026I believe so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cParents?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey are not the issue\u2026but maybe connected to it?\u201d His mother turned into it, hadn\u2019t she? Yes, yes she had, but\u2026but Thor cannot recall what she\u2019d turned into anymore.<br></i></p><p><i>Tony sighs, now presuming the whole thing a giant waffling by the god. \u201cFuck. if it\u2019s Loki just say so, Thor. I\u2019m still unlikely to help, but at least I\u2019d admire the boldness of asking directly.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWha-? Who\u2026Who is\u2026Loki?\u201d And why did it sound so familiar and yet not at the same time?</i></p><p><i>\u201cLoki, also known as Loki Laufeyson or Loki Odinson, is the God of Mischief and listed as a top-tier intergalactic terrorist by S.H.I.E.L.D.. His attempts to take over Earth resulted in the destruction of Manhattan and countless deaths. Captured by The Avengers Initiative he was turned over to his brother, Thor Odinson, God of Thunder, to be returned to Asgard where his punishment would be set by the King of Asgard, Odin Allfather.\u201d The young woman\u2019s turned to them both, face showing a mix of concern and interest. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember your own brother?\u201d</i></p><p><i>She is slight, pale, with spiked, jet black, hair and many bits of metal in her face\u2026Thor cannot recall seeing another like her on Midgard. He smiles in spite of his current predicament. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf him,\u201d Lynk clarifies. \u201cI was lecturing in Boston when he came to New York, but I watched the news. Question is, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Loki himself doing this?\u201d Tony offers. \u201cIt\u2019s not beyond him, right? Take out his brother, escape, rally some troops, come back at Earth again.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re making assumptions without basis,\u201d she counters flatly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy basis is I know the guy. I\u2019ve seen what he can do, first hand.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy give his brother amnesia then send him in your direction?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDistraction? Shits and giggles? How should I know.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>Lynk\u2019s eyes switch to Thor. \u201cWe need more data.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor has no issue with basic or advanced memory tests, brain scans show no clear injury or disease, and nothing can be found in his blood that would suggest a cause for his amnesia. Both Tony and Lynk remain stuck, unsure what to test for next, as Thor lays on the table looking up at both of them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo we know why I\u2019ve forgotten what I\u2019ve forgotten?\u201d Again Loki\u2019s existence has slipped from his mind, but not the urgency of the need to help, to get help.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony sighs; Thor frowns deeply. \u201cBut I\u2019m starting to guess some kind of magic, which leads us back to Loki.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure you actually need help, Thor? Or do you just\u2026feel like you need it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need help, of that I\u2019m certain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lynk looks down. \u201cWith\u2026or for\u2026your brother, Loki, yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The fog thickens. \u201cI\u2026cannot recall.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony rolls eyes in frustration, convinced this is some elaborate trick by the <i>God of Mischief</i>. He wants no part of it; better to hunker down, fortify, with backup plans for when Loki\u2019s true scheme is ultimately revealed. <i>\u201cThis is probably all just a big fucking hoax.\u201d </i><br></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is not a hoax!\u201d Thor flies up, roars his own frustration, as sparks crack across the metal table. The need to accomplish a goal he cannot recall has settled deep and sure in his heart even if his mind continues to betray him.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWoah, hey there!\u201d Tony\u2019s thumb discreetly goes to his suit\u2019s activation button as he and Lynk both jump back. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re tricking me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou think another is tricking us all,\u201d Thor states firmly, hammer held out as if ready to crash. \u201cI am not a fool, Stark, I know my own heart!\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI might know someone who can help, Thor,\u201d Lynk speaks up quickly, hoping to both placate and distract as she feels the machines around them shiver with the herself and Tony.<br></i></p><p><i>The storm in the god dies and he turns as hope blooms once more. \u201cTruly?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe might be able to figure out what you can\u2019t remember or, at the very least, maybe why you can\u2019t remember.\u201d She looks to Tony, who\u2019s finally beginning to breathe again. \u201cIf it\u2019s a trick by Loki, then you might know what he\u2019s up to and, if it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d She smiles at Thor. \u201cThen maybe we\u2019ll know how to help.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Honest trouble or not, Tony had no interest in helping Loki. He still woke up in the middle of night, sweaty and short of breath, thanks to that asshole. Best not to piss of his friend, the god, though. \u201cSure, if you know someone who\u2019s willing. Can\u2019t hurt to try, right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRight.\u201d <br></i></p><p><i>Thor grins. \u201cTake me to him now, fair Lynk.\u201d</i></p><hr><p>I legit feel bad writing Thor like this\u2026in part because I know he already gets a bad wrap as sorta being the \u201cslow on the uptake\u201d one and I don\u2019t think he is. That said, Odin\u2019s clouding his - and everyone else in Asgard\u2019s - mind from remembering Loki so it\u2019s not like I can have Thor just putting it all together, haha! Frigga only does because she\u2019s very powerful in magic herself. Lynk is a mutant - though there\u2019s only a hint of her powers shown in this - and will be important to Thor going forward so\u2026hope you like, lol!\u00a0 (And, damn, I\u2019m prod of myself for getting two out relatively quick after the holidays so go me, haha! ^_^)<br></p><p>(Gifs found on Google, then combined by me)<br></p><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m562BH6RQ5p1d3IRn8j3sTA\">@succumb-to-your-king</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mini5uVfVCqBnof0UcwKFJg\">@chibiyanai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miYmuQ-J2lFCJzvNBxKx0Hw\">@wadeyouwitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT4Wa9BOYReycCN_SaAP7_w\">@creedslove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtlDymZJwJfOBhN1P2Pvpqw\">@lady-crowned-with-stars</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBOzTtetGwL8iED5FFWOJtQ\">@moonfaery</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdkbFGMEEnpvO8qSZp2Bakg\">@annievvv7</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqxcLrhKq5EFwpoXjuy9geQ\">@ladyfluff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhHZpL_BA2bH8iRamjXekuQ\">@holykryptonitekitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\">@lokilvrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqnFBJpOxEEzJ-6N-nMA5RQ\">@janebrownnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Q4_fndLPWyaeqfi2R900g\">@lokis-little-kitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfKM89wIdWJspJl0ev7I9kg\">@alexakeyloveloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms1sYijQULo7X0I4ePUXBTw\">@theangelsfightwithdevils</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP6kpQuXZzu4oCd80sHXb0w\">@the-blue-tiefling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO6txStxBzKpnFKzLKJG7Xw\">@lokis-lady-death</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjgs5OcuMkKrs4_MAVIf6Sg\">@dangertoozmanykids101</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz-vKKclAh0OX23Y8XKK0KQ\">@prometheasmother</a> <strike>@</strike><a href=\"https://vethrvolnir.tumblr.com/\"><strike>vethrvolnir </strike> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQZ0wfg0mTTVA8Ydv3NSC0Q\">@wintertink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqOGfTW0AeSA1n8vLZ7u_Lw\">@amethyst-dreams-and-candy-canes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxdrHNYrR7AjkvtLqnGgSA\">@drakonwild</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhAZmv5DVlbw1aJ6DuY58dg\">@starscreamloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCJGlnPT_YJLLW8d4Dt_9dQ\">@judas-nipples</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZJzmZri8iN5RYQQSnTzdA\">@hiddles-rose</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB1uFR4WcIvHHys6f_N7Yw\">@the-lady-witchitery</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3z8elk82Qi-xJ8B2OajTPQ\">@galaxies-inside-my-head</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz4i80zhRtPdGm3DCoCUTdA\">@<strike>jackheart180</strike></a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrgFaNxE_mV5BXAkrrrMKEA\">@lukeevansandjdmobession</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnb_XX1op8KKmoee2KeLYYg\">@endlessstairway</a><a> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmmZaK6kcvIAdonOCB3xQw\">@lanabanana-86</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZxmk80GDzS_j-u2EUWA_Rg\">@tom-fucking-hiddleston-1981</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma0bDQc4uSYsb9iD5yMTbHA\">@lovekrystina</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvqK4xvxjvq42TaYRP1L8jA\">@madoka73</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR4YJ4CxLZyLvGa4GTNJYQg\">@lokikingofasgardslover713</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m78sYG--AeQ4JjclpZYTuPA\">@partiallyinthecloset</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr7Wx1TKgUZ1IeCTLjIRd4Q\">@ultrarebelheart</a> \u00a0<strike>@gravitational-anomaly</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4K7iutRt0ib7aTV7pIHBIw\">@manip-loki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzF0cO2L9q5hgKl28V6ud2Q\">@my-world-of-imagines</a> @<strike>lowcarbgem</strike>\u00a0 \u2026Think that\u2019s everyone from FrostBitten, if you want on or off, just \nlemme know!

Only tenuous threads he cannot weave into anything substantial and even those fray before his very mind&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;I am sorry, Thor, but I can find nothing.&rdquo; It was so very usual, very strange. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s something to do with your time on Midgard?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;Perhaps&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Shall I send you there in search of answers and this lost&hellip;thing.&rdquo; Heimdall himself&rsquo;s already forgotten what they&rsquo;re in search for.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, I shall go to Stark&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He cannot say why he picks Tony except he&rsquo;s the smartest man Thor knows of on Midgard. And, if this&hellip;Loki&hellip;was a dangerous thing Tony would most certainly be prepared and ready for battle beside him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Very well, my prince, I shall send you directly,&rdquo; Heimdall bows his head and, in a moment&rsquo;s flash, Thor is at the end of Stark&rsquo;s long landing pad at The Avenger&rsquo;s Tower.</i></p><p><i>Not even leaving his lands can stop the disintegration of Thor&rsquo;s memory though; not even reaching Midgard can protect him from his own father&rsquo;s magic. By the time he reaches Stark, lounging on a deck chair, his face&rsquo;s fallen to confusion. &hellip;What has he come to ask again?</i></p><p><i>Tony&rsquo;s brows rise in alarm, then fall in the wait for Thor to speak. &ldquo;You alright there, Point Break?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my friend.&rdquo; Thor knows he needs help, but the reason, the trouble, is fogged from him. It&rsquo;s something distant, unattainable, but very true and very real. &ldquo;I&hellip;I came to request your aid&hellip;only now I&rsquo;ve forgotten why.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So you came here to ask for my help&hellip;&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s stands, examines his friend more closely. &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t remember with what?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; Thor confesses with a sigh, running hand through hair, twisting hammer in the other. He can remember years, centuries. He has a god&rsquo;s memory, how can he forget something he is certain recently occurred?!<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You hit your head on the Bifrost or something?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Eyes fall to despair. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;.huh&hellip;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t think gods could get amnesia, yet here was Thor, a god, standing all amnesiac before him. &ldquo;Look, buddy, how &lsquo;bout we go inside, have a drink, and see if we can&rsquo;t figure this out, yeah?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Very well, my friend.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Tony lets Thor follow as his mind begins to gather what little facts there are and formulate theories. Whatever is going on, it&rsquo;s powerful enough to mess with a god&rsquo;s mind. That said, Thor seems of sound mind and, potentially, with solid recall aside from whatever he needs help with. So what are they looking at here? Injury? Infection? Something else entirely? Tony skips the bar in the penthouse for the one down in his workshop and let&rsquo;s Thor settle on a nearby chair as he pours for both of them - definitely need a drink or two before opening whatever can of worms this is.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I adjusted the coding and cleared out the spare bugs from your latest suit, Stark.&rdquo; The voice itself is almost robotic, but Thor sees clearly the being is flesh and blood. Back to them, hunkering down over a series of computers, he catches feminine eyes in the reflection of one of the screens. &ldquo;That Thor?&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Tony tips back his first drink, pours his second, as Thor takes his first. &ldquo;Lynk, this is Thor, Thor,&rdquo; he points to the person&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Lynk with a Y&hellip;my tech assistant.&rdquo; Pepper will always run most of his stuff, but Lynk has certain, unique, abilities that makes her utterly invaluable to him in his work.</i></p><p><i>Thor smiles. &ldquo;Greetings, fair maid.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;No.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Thor&rsquo;s face falls. &ldquo;No?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Lips lift, but focus remains on the computers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fair maid, Mr Odinson. I&rsquo;m just Lynk.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You may call me Thor, if you wish.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay then, Thor. I&rsquo;m still Lynk.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>Thor looks to Tony, unsure, but Tony just shrugs and finishes his second drink. &ldquo;Okay, so this thing you need help with&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do process of elimination.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It have anything to do with Earth?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;Not directly, I don&rsquo;t believe&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Asgard then?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You personally?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;I&hellip;in a way, perhaps?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Family maybe?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Thor&rsquo;s pause is especially long, his heart and mind arguing for an accurate answer. &ldquo;I&hellip;I believe so.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Parents?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They are not the issue&hellip;but maybe connected to it?&rdquo; His mother turned into it, hadn&rsquo;t she? Yes, yes she had, but&hellip;but Thor cannot recall what she&rsquo;d turned into anymore.<br /></i></p><p><i>Tony sighs, now presuming the whole thing a giant waffling by the god. &ldquo;Fuck. if it&rsquo;s Loki just say so, Thor. I&rsquo;m still unlikely to help, but at least I&rsquo;d admire the boldness of asking directly.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wha-? Who&hellip;Who is&hellip;Loki?&rdquo; And why did it sound so familiar and yet not at the same time?</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Loki, also known as Loki Laufeyson or Loki Odinson, is the God of Mischief and listed as a top-tier intergalactic terrorist by S.H.I.E.L.D.. His attempts to take over Earth resulted in the destruction of Manhattan and countless deaths. Captured by The Avengers Initiative he was turned over to his brother, Thor Odinson, God of Thunder, to be returned to Asgard where his punishment would be set by the King of Asgard, Odin Allfather.&rdquo; The young woman&rsquo;s turned to them both, face showing a mix of concern and interest. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t remember your own brother?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She is slight, pale, with spiked, jet black, hair and many bits of metal in her face&hellip;Thor cannot recall seeing another like her on Midgard. He smiles in spite of his current predicament. &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of him,&rdquo; Lynk clarifies. &ldquo;I was lecturing in Boston when he came to New York, but I watched the news. Question is, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Loki himself doing this?&rdquo; Tony offers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not beyond him, right? Take out his brother, escape, rally some troops, come back at Earth again.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making assumptions without basis,&rdquo; she counters flatly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My basis is I know the guy. I&rsquo;ve seen what he can do, first hand.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why give his brother amnesia then send him in your direction?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Distraction? Shits and giggles? How should I know.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>Lynk&rsquo;s eyes switch to Thor. &ldquo;We need more data.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Thor has no issue with basic or advanced memory tests, brain scans show no clear injury or disease, and nothing can be found in his blood that would suggest a cause for his amnesia. Both Tony and Lynk remain stuck, unsure what to test for next, as Thor lays on the table looking up at both of them.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do we know why I&rsquo;ve forgotten what I&rsquo;ve forgotten?&rdquo; Again Loki&rsquo;s existence has slipped from his mind, but not the urgency of the need to help, to get help.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony sighs; Thor frowns deeply. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m starting to guess some kind of magic, which leads us back to Loki.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you sure you actually need help, Thor? Or do you just&hellip;feel like you need it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I need help, of that I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Lynk looks down. &ldquo;With&hellip;or for&hellip;your brother, Loki, yeah?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The fog thickens. &ldquo;I&hellip;cannot recall.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Tony rolls eyes in frustration, convinced this is some elaborate trick by the <i>God of Mischief</i>. He wants no part of it; better to hunker down, fortify, with backup plans for when Loki&rsquo;s true scheme is ultimately revealed. <i>&ldquo;This is probably all just a big fucking hoax.&rdquo; </i><br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It is not a hoax!&rdquo; Thor flies up, roars his own frustration, as sparks crack across the metal table. The need to accomplish a goal he cannot recall has settled deep and sure in his heart even if his mind continues to betray him.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Woah, hey there!&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s thumb discreetly goes to his suit&rsquo;s activation button as he and Lynk both jump back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re tricking me.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You think another is tricking us all,&rdquo; Thor states firmly, hammer held out as if ready to crash. &ldquo;I am not a fool, Stark, I know my own heart!&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I might know someone who can help, Thor,&rdquo; Lynk speaks up quickly, hoping to both placate and distract as she feels the machines around them shiver with the herself and Tony.<br /></i></p><p><i>The storm in the god dies and he turns as hope blooms once more. &ldquo;Truly?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He might be able to figure out what you can&rsquo;t remember or, at the very least, maybe why you can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; She looks to Tony, who&rsquo;s finally beginning to breathe again. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a trick by Loki, then you might know what he&rsquo;s up to and, if it&rsquo;s not&hellip;&rdquo; She smiles at Thor. &ldquo;Then maybe we&rsquo;ll know how to help.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Honest trouble or not, Tony had no interest in helping Loki. He still woke up in the middle of night, sweaty and short of breath, thanks to that asshole. Best not to piss of his friend, the god, though. &ldquo;Sure, if you know someone who&rsquo;s willing. Can&rsquo;t hurt to try, right?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; <br /></i></p><p><i>Thor grins. &ldquo;Take me to him now, fair Lynk.&rdquo;</i></p><hr /><p>I legit feel bad writing Thor like this&hellip;in part because I know he already gets a bad wrap as sorta being the &ldquo;slow on the uptake&rdquo; one and I don&rsquo;t think he is. That said, Odin&rsquo;s clouding his - and everyone else in Asgard&rsquo;s - mind from remembering Loki so it&rsquo;s not like I can have Thor just putting it all together, haha! Frigga only does because she&rsquo;s very powerful in magic herself. Lynk is a mutant - though there&rsquo;s only a hint of her powers shown in this - and will be important to Thor going forward so&hellip;hope you like, lol!&nbsp; (And, damn, I&rsquo;m prod of myself for getting two out relatively quick after the holidays so go me, haha! ^_^)<br /></p><p>(Gifs found on Google, then combined by me)<br /></p><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m562BH6RQ5p1d3IRn8j3sTA\">@succumb-to-your-king</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mini5uVfVCqBnof0UcwKFJg\">@chibiyanai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miYmuQ-J2lFCJzvNBxKx0Hw\">@wadeyouwitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT4Wa9BOYReycCN_SaAP7_w\">@creedslove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtlDymZJwJfOBhN1P2Pvpqw\">@lady-crowned-with-stars</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBOzTtetGwL8iED5FFWOJtQ\">@moonfaery</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdkbFGMEEnpvO8qSZp2Bakg\">@annievvv7</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqxcLrhKq5EFwpoXjuy9geQ\">@ladyfluff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhHZpL_BA2bH8iRamjXekuQ\">@holykryptonitekitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\">@lokilvrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqnFBJpOxEEzJ-6N-nMA5RQ\">@janebrownnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Q4_fndLPWyaeqfi2R900g\">@lokis-little-kitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfKM89wIdWJspJl0ev7I9kg\">@alexakeyloveloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms1sYijQULo7X0I4ePUXBTw\">@theangelsfightwithdevils</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP6kpQuXZzu4oCd80sHXb0w\">@the-blue-tiefling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO6txStxBzKpnFKzLKJG7Xw\">@lokis-lady-death</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjgs5OcuMkKrs4_MAVIf6Sg\">@dangertoozmanykids101</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz-vKKclAh0OX23Y8XKK0KQ\">@prometheasmother</a> <strike>@</strike><a href=\"https://vethrvolnir.tumblr.com/\"><strike>vethrvolnir </strike> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQZ0wfg0mTTVA8Ydv3NSC0Q\">@wintertink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqOGfTW0AeSA1n8vLZ7u_Lw\">@amethyst-dreams-and-candy-canes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxdrHNYrR7AjkvtLqnGgSA\">@drakonwild</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhAZmv5DVlbw1aJ6DuY58dg\">@starscreamloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCJGlnPT_YJLLW8d4Dt_9dQ\">@judas-nipples</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZJzmZri8iN5RYQQSnTzdA\">@hiddles-rose</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB1uFR4WcIvHHys6f_N7Yw\">@the-lady-witchitery</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3z8elk82Qi-xJ8B2OajTPQ\">@galaxies-inside-my-head</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz4i80zhRtPdGm3DCoCUTdA\">@<strike>jackheart180</strike></a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrgFaNxE_mV5BXAkrrrMKEA\">@lukeevansandjdmobession</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnb_XX1op8KKmoee2KeLYYg\">@endlessstairway</a><a> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmmZaK6kcvIAdonOCB3xQw\">@lanabanana-86</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZxmk80GDzS_j-u2EUWA_Rg\">@tom-fucking-hiddleston-1981</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma0bDQc4uSYsb9iD5yMTbHA\">@lovekrystina</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvqK4xvxjvq42TaYRP1L8jA\">@madoka73</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR4YJ4CxLZyLvGa4GTNJYQg\">@lokikingofasgardslover713</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m78sYG--AeQ4JjclpZYTuPA\">@partiallyinthecloset</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr7Wx1TKgUZ1IeCTLjIRd4Q\">@ultrarebelheart</a> &nbsp;<strike>@gravitational-anomaly</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4K7iutRt0ib7aTV7pIHBIw\">@manip-loki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzF0cO2L9q5hgKl28V6ud2Q\">@my-world-of-imagines</a> @<strike>lowcarbgem</strike>&nbsp; &hellip;Think that&rsquo;s everyone from FrostBitten, if you want on or off, just \nlemme know!

This is the final chapter before the epilogue, so catch up on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15049538/chapters/34888511\">AO3</a>/ <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12981030/1/Sins-of-the-Fathers\">FFN</a> :)</b></i></p><p><i><b>A huge thank-you to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIiZbMd7cKd9s0bjVINsBoA\">@stjohn27</a> for being such an awesome prereader and sounding board.  \u2764\ufe0f </b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>Peter shook his head, his eyes once again stinging with tears as he imagined how lost and helpless his father must be feeling right now with him gone.  He couldn&rsquo;t imagine that their close-knit family would allow Dad to push everyone away again, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he wouldn&rsquo;t try to do so.  Dad was one of the most stubborn people Peter had ever seen.</p><p>Inhaling a deep, shaky breath, Peter finally managed to unwind his cramped arms from around the lamppost.  Swiping the tears from his eyes, he got to his feet, backing up into the side of a nearby building so he could try and sort through the tangled mess of thoughts and fears all jumbling around in his mind.</p><p>Because it was right about now that over in the fancy glass dome, Peter\u2019s younger self was coming face to face with his soon-to-be adoptive father for the first time.  Almost instinctively, Peter\u2019s hand went to his head, remembering how Dad had patted him on the top of his Iron Man helmet as he handed him the signed Iron Man picture that still sat framed on Peter\u2019s dresser back at the Tower.</p><p>And at the same time, Ben and May were <i>here</i>.  They were still alive.  And all Peter had to do to keep them that way was to somehow warn them to stay away from the Expo on the night of the drone attack.  Ben and May were his uncle and aunt, his blood relatives who had selflessly taken him in without a second thought after his parents were killed.  They had deserved far better than to simply become casualties in some twisted criminal\u2019s private vengeance against Iron Man.</p><p>But almost before that thought had even completely left his mind, Peter felt that squicky feeling of the ice running down his back that he\u2019d come to associate with danger, and he let out a hard shudder.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he asked softly through his chattering teeth.  Peter had finally gotten accustomed to trusting what he and Dad were calling his Spider Sense, the sixth sense of his that seemed to activate whenever Peter was around something dangerous, and also helped him control his lightning-fast reflexes.  But every now and then it seemed to go off at times that made little to no sense to Peter, and this was definitely one of those times.  Because why on earth would his Spider Sense consider Ben and May to be dangerous?  They were two of the least-scary, non-threatening people Peter had ever known.</p><p>Unless\u2026 </p><p><i>Oh my God.</i></p><p>Squeezing his eyes closed, Peter tipped his head back against the building and pressed his palms to his chest, trying to calm himself down enough to think clearly.

He\u2019s not a full-time resident, to start with. At best, he\u2019s that certain kind of non-native Manhattan person who is only versed in the tiny part of the city they see everyday and the rest of the city is an out-of-focus vague blob.

Also, that story is probably what you\u2019re thinking about in terms of NYC granular detail.) And for Tony, it\u2019s an even tinier slice of the pie because he lives the rarified air of super-rich New Money NYC. The City to him is Midtown and south and what he sees out of limo windows or out his penthouse terrace &ndash; when he bothers to look. The only times he\u2019s been north of Central Park South (on the ground) have been to go to a gala at the Met and that\u2019s in a limo. He\u2019s got no real sense of the place qua place and that is not something that changes once he\u2019s flying over it as Iron Man.\u00a0</p><p>Peter\u2019s a city boy in the way Outer Borough kids have to be &ndash; things are much further apart so you are much more dependent upon mass transit and know it much better, you are constantly going to Manhattan for one thing or another even just for school trips and so your world is more than just your zip code, you become more aware of city services because you see both less and more of them. Plus, he\u2019s going to be exposed to a lot just for that because most of his classmates are going to be first- or second-generation American and from lots of different countries. His super-heroics are also ground-level and that both fosters and requires an intimate and extensive knowledge of the area.\u00a0</p>",
