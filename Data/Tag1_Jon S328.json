        "body": "<p>Christmas came and went. As she grew older, Sansa cared less for presents and more for the opportunity to spend time with those she loved. But her parents did buy her a gorgeous hair pin shaped like a dragonfly that she wore on New Year\u2019s Eve, Bran got her some new books on rhetoric, politics, and intersectional feminism that she was eager to read, and Arya gave her a slip of paper that just read \u201cLater.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d she\u2019d asked when she pulled the piece\nof paper out of the plain box Arya had wrapped it in.<br/><br/>\n\u201cExactly what it says,\u201d was her sister\u2019s enigmatic reply.<br/><br/>\nLuckily, Robb\u2019s gift of fancy assorted teas and Rickon\u2019s\npresent, a novelty t-shirt that read \u2018You Can\u2019t Frighten Me,\u2019 didn\u2019t need as\nmuch explaining.<br/><br/>\nThey had a more subdued holiday season than usual. Robb was\nhome for only a short time, as he was busy with his internship and business\nschool applications. Now that she had been away for school herself, Sansa felt\nlike she could understood Rob and his business a bit better. She loved spending\ntime with her family, sleeping in her own room, and being back in Winterfell,\nbut she spent more time than usual on her phone texting to the group chat she,\nMeera, and Brienne had formed. It felt so strange, after spending every day\ntogether, not to see them. Robb knew what she felt right away. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like\nhaving two families,\u201d he explained. \u201cYour family at home, and the little family\nyou have at school. You just have to balance it.\u201d</p><p>Robb was right,\nand she settled back into home, such that it felt like her first semester away seemed\nlike a strange dream. Rickon got a cold, and then everyone did. Despite the\nillness, Bran was being quieter than usual, and Arya would go through fits of\nbeing wild and then sullen. Sansa spent a lot of the break with Ghost. Mr.\nMormont was taking a few days off to go visit his son and, knowing she was back\nin town, asked Sansa to keep an eye on Ghost. She was happy to do it. Being\naround Ghost was calming\u2014which she needed.<br/><br/>\nThey were all anxious to hear more news about Jon. He\u2019d been\ntransferred to a hospital nearby so that Mrs. Snow could visit him more easily.\nThere was no news about what that meant in terms of Jon\u2019s status with the\nNight\u2019s Watch. Robb reported that while the situation wasn\u2019t as life-or-death\nas it had been a few weeks before, Jon did need to have more surgery to help\ndeal with some of the eternal bleeding.<br/><br/>\nSurprisingly, it was Catelyn who suggested they all go visit\nhim in the hospital the day after his surgery.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nShe heard her parents discussing it in hushed voices after\ndinner. \u201cThey need to see that he\u2019s going to be okay. They need to see it for\nthemselves.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\n\u201cHer too,\u201d Cat answered, and Sansa\u2019s stomach dropped when she\nrealized they were talking about her. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you can deal with\nthese types of things.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ned agreed with a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll go\u00a0tomorrow. I\u2019ll call Lyanna\nto let her know.\u201d<br/><br/>\nMost of Sansa\u2019s clothes were in her dorm room, so she had\nlimited options the next day. She didn\u2019t want to wear black\u2014didn\u2019t like how\nominous that seemed\u2014so she wore a warm dark blue sweater and her third nicest\npair of jeans. She was quiet on the way over\u2014and so forced herself to chat with\nRickon about what weapon she\u2019d bring with her to the zombie apocalypse. He was\nunimpressed when she told him her brain, because he was obsessed with the\nkatana, but she felt she made a compelling case; it was a good distraction,\neither way.<br/><br/>\nWhen they made their way to Jon\u2019s room and the nurse told\nthem that only three visitors were allowed at a time, Sansa sank into the\nhorrible waiting room wallpaper, allowing her younger siblings to go first. She\ndid her best not to fidget and tried to be as consumed by last year\u2019s fashion\nmagazines as she hoped her face portrayed.<br/><br/>\nHer parents went next, and then she had more trouble keeping\nher hands from fidgeting and her pulse from quickening. When they returned to\nthe waiting room, her father approached her. \u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d Ned said softly.\n\u201cDo you still want to\u2014?\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe nodded. \u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d<br/><br/>\nSansa shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe found his room easily enough and tried her best to keep\nher knees from shaking.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nJon was lying in bed, asleep like her father had said. The\nsight of him took her breath away. His skin looked sallow, his face too thin.\nHis beautiful hair was gone, cropped tightly to his head. When she stepped\ncloser, she could see a dark red scar that trailed his left eye.</p><p><br/>\nShe sat down in the chair next to his bed so she could study\nhim more. His chest was covered by a standard hospital gown, but she could spy\nheavy gauze beneath it. He looked awful, but he was breathing, slow and steady.\nShe concentrated on the sound of his breaths and the movement of his chest. And\nshe prayed to the gods\u2014the old ones her father kept\u2014and asked them to heal him,\nmake him strong again.<br/><br/>\nShe was so wrapped up in her prayers that she didn\u2019t notice\nsomeone else had entered the room until she heard her name being called.<br/><br/>\nShe tore her eyes away to see Mrs. Snow. Sansa immediately\nrose to her feet. \u201cHi.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHello.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for all you must be going through.\u201d<br/><br/>\nLyanna gave her a weak smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d She gazed over at\nJon. \u201cThat boy is my whole world. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if I lost\nhim.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSansa didn\u2019t know what to say, so she just nodded. Even under\nmore normal circumstances, she\u2019d never known quite what to say to Mrs. Snow.\nWhen she was younger, she\u2019d always been wary of her because her mother didn\u2019t\nlike Lyanna for some unspoken reason. But Sansa could sense the tension between\nthe two women, and she\u2019d loyally taken her mother\u2019s side. Then, when she grew\nolder and her crush on Jon had bloomed, she\u2019d worried that Mrs. Snow wouldn\u2019t\nlike her\u2014that she\u2019d think her too prissy or unworthy or childish. When Jon had\nleft, she\u2019d maintained her avoidance because Mrs. Snow\u2019s eyes looked far too\nmuch like her son\u2019s.<br/><br/>\nSansa fidgeted with her hands. \u201cI should get going. My family\nis waiting.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThank you for coming.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cOf course. Everyone was worried when we hear the news. When\nI heard\u2014I\u2014we were all worried. We all care about Jon.\u201d<br/><br/>\nMrs. Snow sighed and eyed her sympathetically. \u201cI see that\nnow. I didn\u2019t before. I\u2014I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSansa gave her a puzzled smile, bid her goodbye, and left the\nroom as quickly as she could. When she made her way back to the waiting room,\nshe felt drained.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nArya must have noticed because as soon as she crossed the\nthreshold her little sister took Sansa\u2019s hand and flashed her keys.<br/><br/>\n\u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAbsolutely no idea.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s later.\u201d<br/><br/>\nLater apparently meant driving to a tattoo parlor,\ndiscovering that Arya, despite being only sixteen and a half, had acquired a\nfake ID, and being sweet-talked into getting matching wolf tattoos on their\narms.\u00a0<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe need to do this!\u201d Arya insisted.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo, actually, we really don\u2019t.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Sansa. Be brave!\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI am brave.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBe bold.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHave you seen my shoe collection?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBe spontaneous!\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAnd live to regret it?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about matching wolves, Sansa? How could you ever\nregret a sign that you\u2019re part of the pack?\u201d<br/><br/>\nSansa could not convince Arya that her scheme was a poor one,\nbut she did at least get Arya to agree to a smaller, less menacing design. They\nsettled on the outline of the sigil from the centuries-old Stark family crest.\nArya\u2019s asked for her teeth to be a little more pronounced, and Sansa asked for\nthe eye of her wolf\u2019s profile to be red and for the fur to look perfectly\ncombed, so she could honor both Ghost and Lady.<br/><br/>\nArya wanted to get hers on her arm, but Sansa didn\u2019t want\nhers to be as easily visible.<br/><br/>\n\u201cJust don\u2019t get it on your hip,\u201d Arya insisted. \u201cDon\u2019t be\nthat girl.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSansa rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong with being that\ngirl?\u201d But in the end, she chose her left shoulder blade.<br/><br/>\nThe process was long and painful\u2014more painful than Sansa had\nsupposed. She gripped Arya\u2019s hand the entire time, doing her best not to curse\nher little sister out with each sting of the needle.<br/><br/>\n\u201cRemind me never to accept a gift from you,\u201d she said with\ngritted teeth.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon. Every hurt is a lesson.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m smart enough,\u201d Sansa grumbled.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nThirty minutes later, though, when the blood had been cleared away and the pain\nhad numbed, Sansa stared at their tattoos in awe.\u00a0<br/><br/>\n\u201cWorth it, huh?\u201d Arya preened.<br/><br/>\n\u201cOh, shut it,\u201d replied Sansa, suppressing a smile and\nsneaking another look at her tattoo in the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s\ntelling Mom.\u201d<br/><br/><br/>\nThey were both punished for the rest of Sansa\u2019s break, though\nthe recent drama seemed to give them somewhat of a reprieve. Cat could not\nbelieve that they both had tarnished their beautiful skin, and Ned had agreed,\nthough privately praised them for choosing the Stark sigil.<br/><br/></p><p>Margaery had been beside herself\nwhen Sansa showed her. \u201cLook at you, Sansa Stark, badass extraordinaire.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had glowed under the\npraise. </p><p><br/>\nWhen she returned to school, she felt like she was carrying a\nsecret no one knew but her and her sister. She quite liked that feeling.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nCollege life was going well. She, Meera, and Brienne seemed\nto grow closer every day, and her classes became more and more interesting.\nWhen the spring semester ended, she was sad to leave the little family she\u2019d\ncreated. But like Robb had said, it was all about balance. And though\nshe was sad to leave her friends for a few months, she was overjoyed to be back\nwith her family. After Robb\u2019s college graduation, he had a few weeks before he\nneeded to start getting ready for business school to spend relaxing. And the\nStark siblings went hard. </p><p>They played every board game they\nowned, the watched every favorite film\u2014\u2018A Dance with Dragons\u2019 included, they\nate their favorite meals and stayed up late telling the ghost stories Nan used\nto scare them with when they were little. It was a great summer\u2014which made it\nbittersweet to go back to Riverrun to reunite with her friends. <br/><br/>\nSophomore year presented new challenges. After hearing about\ntrafficking incidents at the nearby Frey University and a #MeToo scandal\nconcerning a Professor Petyr Baelish in the Political Science department, Sansa\nlaunched herself into Take By the Night and women\u2019s leadership groups. Brienne\ngot involved by hosting free self-defense classes, and Meera designed rape\nwhistles to pass out to students on campus.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nThrough her work, Sansa became really good friends with a\ngirl named Gilly, who admitted late one night that she\u2019d been molested by her\nown father. That\u2019s when Sansa started volunteering at Riverrun\u2019s counseling\ncenter.<br/><br/>\nThinking she could do more, Sansa began to consider whether\nshe should go into law, where maybe she could help to shape better policy for\nwomen and survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. Toward the end of her\nsophomore year, Sansa joined the pre-law society, and that\u2019s where she met\nDickon.<br/><br/>\nShe hadn\u2019t been looking to start a new relationship. She had\nher friends and school and her family and her volunteer work. Apart from a\none-time fumble with Podrick, which they\u2019d both agreed was a mistake and he\u2019d\nonly recently been able to look her in the eye again, Sansa hadn\u2019t had pursued\nmuch in terms of romance.<br/><br/>\nAnd Dickon was a couple years older than her, already\nenrolled in the Riverrun law program and helping mentor younger students. And\nhe was devastatingly handsome. Thick light brown hair, full lips, strong jaw,\neven stronger shoulders. His physique, combined with his general affability,\nreminded her a bit of Hercules from the Disney movie, and that was very\ndangerous.<br/><br/>\nHe\u2019d revealed to her one afternoon as they were waiting in\nline for the free cookies that he\u2019d been a swimmer in high school and kept it\nup to relieve stress.<br/><br/>\nAnd as much as Sansa wanted to lick whatever stress he felt\naway, she was hesitant to give in too much to his flirtations. Dickon was sweet\nand considerate and had wonderfully sexy dimples.<br/><br/>\nHe made her heart skip sometimes, in a way she hadn\u2019t felt\nsince Edric. But her relationship with Edric had been so good\u2014and it had ended\nso well. Could she really be so lucky again? She doubted it. Dickon made her\nnervous precisely because he seemed so safe. He was a protector, and Sansa\ndidn\u2019t want to feel like she needed protecting.<br/><br/>\nBut when he asked if he could have her number so he could\ncall her over the summer, she gave it to him, figuring he wouldn\u2019t remember to\ndo so anyway.<br/><br/>\nBut he did. Several times&hellip;to the point that he called every\nfew days. He didn\u2019t monopolize her day, but he told her about how his\ninternship was going and asked about her day. He loved to hear stories about\nArya because he said he missed his own little sister.</p><p>His laugh was full, like she\ncould hear it coming out of his throat. His voice was deep and sure, and it was\neasy to feel a bit lost in it.<br/><br/>\nDuring these calls, she found out that he was a lot more than\njust devastatingly handsome. He told her how he wanted to be a lawyer so he\ncould work as an advocate for the environment and how he stressed about what\nhis super conservative dad would say when he explained he wasn\u2019t going to go\ninto corporate law. He seemed genuinely supportive of her desire to help\nwomen and survivors of abuse and told her how much he wished his sister had a\nrole model like her.<br/><br/>\nHe talked about his older brother, too, who was a medic for\nthe Night\u2019s Watch and how much he worried about him.<br/><br/>\nAnd hearing Dickon say that, Sansa felt she could tell him\nshe knew someone in the Night\u2019s Watch too. And that he\u2019d gotten badly wounded\nand was still in rehab last she heard. And how she\u2019d worried about him all the\ntime, but particularly on late quiet nights when she didn\u2019t know if he was\nalive or dead. And how finding out he\u2019d been wounded was horrifying, but\nhorribly, she found she was a tiny bit grateful for it, because now she knew he\nwas safe.<br/><br/>\nAnd one night, while she was taking a walk to clear her mind\nafter having visited Ghost for the majority of the day, when they were on the\nsubject of the Night\u2019s Watch and he finally asked what Jon was to her, she let\nout a long sigh.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI thought maybe I could have loved him, but he didn\u2019t feel\nthe same. When we could have had a chance, he decided to leave.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWell, then, he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSansa gave a weak laugh. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really mean it, Sansa. You\u2019re\namazing. Smart, driven, kind. I love talking to you.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYeah?\u201d she asked, grinning like a fool.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I might not\nbe as smart as my brother Sam, but I\u2019m no idiot.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI mean, if I had a shot with you, Sansa, I wouldn\u2019t be fool\nenough to throw it away.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWho\u2019s to say you don\u2019t?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAre you saying that I do?\u201d<br/><br/>\nSansa inhaled sharply. \u201cI\u2019m saying that when I get back to\nRiverrun there\u2019s a bakery on Third Street I really like that makes lovely lemon\nscones.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI happen to love scones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then it\u2019s a date.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>",

Robb was\nhome for only a short time, as he was busy with his internship and business\nschool applications. Now that she had been away for school herself, Sansa felt\nlike she could understood Rob and his business a bit better. She loved spending\ntime with her family, sleeping in her own room, and being back in Winterfell,\nbut she spent more time than usual on her phone texting to the group chat she,\nMeera, and Brienne had formed. It felt so strange, after spending every day\ntogether, not to see them. Robb knew what she felt right away. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like\nhaving two families,\u201d he explained. \u201cYour family at home, and the little family\nyou have at school. You just have to balance it.\u201d</p><p>Robb was right,\nand she settled back into home, such that it felt like her first semester away seemed\nlike a strange dream. Rickon got a cold, and then everyone did. Despite the\nillness, Bran was being quieter than usual, and Arya would go through fits of\nbeing wild and then sullen. Sansa spent a lot of the break with Ghost. Mr.\nMormont was taking a few days off to go visit his son and, knowing she was back\nin town, asked Sansa to keep an eye on Ghost. She was happy to do it. Being\naround Ghost was calming\u2014which she needed.<br><br>\nThey were all anxious to hear more news about Jon. He\u2019d been\ntransferred to a hospital nearby so that Mrs. Snow could visit him more easily.\nThere was no news about what that meant in terms of Jon\u2019s status with the\nNight\u2019s Watch. Robb reported that while the situation wasn\u2019t as life-or-death\nas it had been a few weeks before, Jon did need to have more surgery to help\ndeal with some of the eternal bleeding.<br><br>\nSurprisingly, it was Catelyn who suggested they all go visit\nhim in the hospital the day after his surgery.\u00a0<br><br>\nShe heard her parents discussing it in hushed voices after\ndinner. \u201cThey need to see that he\u2019s going to be okay. They need to see it for\nthemselves.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201c<br><br>\n\u201cHer too,\u201d Cat answered, and Sansa\u2019s stomach dropped when she\nrealized they were talking about her. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you can deal with\nthese types of things.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ned agreed with a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll go\u00a0tomorrow. I\u2019ll call Lyanna\nto let her know.\u201d<br><br>\nMost of Sansa\u2019s clothes were in her dorm room, so she had\nlimited options the next day. She didn\u2019t want to wear black\u2014didn\u2019t like how\nominous that seemed\u2014so she wore a warm dark blue sweater and her third nicest\npair of jeans. She was quiet on the way over\u2014and so forced herself to chat with\nRickon about what weapon she\u2019d bring with her to the zombie apocalypse. He was\nunimpressed when she told him her brain, because he was obsessed with the\nkatana, but she felt she made a compelling case; it was a good distraction,\neither way.<br><br>\nWhen they made their way to Jon\u2019s room and the nurse told\nthem that only three visitors were allowed at a time, Sansa sank into the\nhorrible waiting room wallpaper, allowing her younger siblings to go first. She\ndid her best not to fidget and tried to be as consumed by last year\u2019s fashion\nmagazines as she hoped her face portrayed.<br><br>\nHer parents went next, and then she had more trouble keeping\nher hands from fidgeting and her pulse from quickening. When they returned to\nthe waiting room, her father approached her. \u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d Ned said softly.\n\u201cDo you still want to\u2014?\u201d<br><br>\nShe nodded. \u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d<br><br>\nSansa shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d<br><br>\nShe found his room easily enough and tried her best to keep\nher knees from shaking.\u00a0<br><br>\nJon was lying in bed, asleep like her father had said. The\nsight of him took her breath away. His skin looked sallow, his face too thin.\nHis beautiful hair was gone, cropped tightly to his head. When she stepped\ncloser, she could see a dark red scar that trailed his left eye.</p><p><br>\nShe sat down in the chair next to his bed so she could study\nhim more. His chest was covered by a standard hospital gown, but she could spy\nheavy gauze beneath it. He looked awful, but he was breathing, slow and steady.\nShe concentrated on the sound of his breaths and the movement of his chest. And\nshe prayed to the gods\u2014the old ones her father kept\u2014and asked them to heal him,\nmake him strong again.<br><br>\nShe was so wrapped up in her prayers that she didn\u2019t notice\nsomeone else had entered the room until she heard her name being called.<br><br>\nShe tore her eyes away to see Mrs. Snow. Sansa immediately\nrose to her feet. \u201cHi.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHello.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for all you must be going through.\u201d<br><br>\nLyanna gave her a weak smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d She gazed over at\nJon. \u201cThat boy is my whole world. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if I lost\nhim.\u201d<br><br>\nSansa didn\u2019t know what to say, so she just nodded. Even under\nmore normal circumstances, she\u2019d never known quite what to say to Mrs. Snow.\nWhen she was younger, she\u2019d always been wary of her because her mother didn\u2019t\nlike Lyanna for some unspoken reason. But Sansa could sense the tension between\nthe two women, and she\u2019d loyally taken her mother\u2019s side. Then, when she grew\nolder and her crush on Jon had bloomed, she\u2019d worried that Mrs. Snow wouldn\u2019t\nlike her\u2014that she\u2019d think her too prissy or unworthy or childish. When Jon had\nleft, she\u2019d maintained her avoidance because Mrs. Snow\u2019s eyes looked far too\nmuch like her son\u2019s.<br><br>\nSansa fidgeted with her hands. \u201cI should get going. My family\nis waiting.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThank you for coming.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOf course. Everyone was worried when we hear the news. When\nI heard\u2014I\u2014we were all worried. We all care about Jon.\u201d<br><br>\nMrs. Snow sighed and eyed her sympathetically. \u201cI see that\nnow. I didn\u2019t before. I\u2014I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d<br><br>\nSansa gave her a puzzled smile, bid her goodbye, and left the\nroom as quickly as she could. When she made her way back to the waiting room,\nshe felt drained.\u00a0<br><br>\nArya must have noticed because as soon as she crossed the\nthreshold her little sister took Sansa\u2019s hand and flashed her keys.<br><br>\n\u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAbsolutely no idea.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s later.\u201d<br><br>\nLater apparently meant driving to a tattoo parlor,\ndiscovering that Arya, despite being only sixteen and a half, had acquired a\nfake ID, and being sweet-talked into getting matching wolf tattoos on their\narms.\u00a0<br><br>\n\u201cWe need to do this!\u201d Arya insisted.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, actually, we really don\u2019t.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Sansa. Be brave!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI am brave.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBe bold.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHave you seen my shoe collection?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBe spontaneous!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd live to regret it?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about matching wolves, Sansa?

He was a protector, and Sansa\ndidn\u2019t want to feel like she needed protecting.<br><br>\nBut when he asked if he could have her number so he could\ncall her over the summer, she gave it to him, figuring he wouldn\u2019t remember to\ndo so anyway.<br><br>\nBut he did. Several times\u2026to the point that he called every\nfew days. He didn\u2019t monopolize her day, but he told her about how his\ninternship was going and asked about her day. He loved to hear stories about\nArya because he said he missed his own little sister.</p><p>His laugh was full, like she\ncould hear it coming out of his throat. His voice was deep and sure, and it was\neasy to feel a bit lost in it.<br><br>\nDuring these calls, she found out that he was a lot more than\njust devastatingly handsome. He told her how he wanted to be a lawyer so he\ncould work as an advocate for the environment and how he stressed about what\nhis super conservative dad would say when he explained he wasn\u2019t going to go\ninto corporate law. He seemed genuinely supportive of her desire to help\nwomen and survivors of abuse and told her how much he wished his sister had a\nrole model like her.<br><br>\nHe talked about his older brother, too, who was a medic for\nthe Night\u2019s Watch and how much he worried about him.<br><br>\nAnd hearing Dickon say that, Sansa felt she could tell him\nshe knew someone in the Night\u2019s Watch too. And that he\u2019d gotten badly wounded\nand was still in rehab last she heard. And how she\u2019d worried about him all the\ntime, but particularly on late quiet nights when she didn\u2019t know if he was\nalive or dead. And how finding out he\u2019d been wounded was horrifying, but\nhorribly, she found she was a tiny bit grateful for it, because now she knew he\nwas safe.<br><br>\nAnd one night, while she was taking a walk to clear her mind\nafter having visited Ghost for the majority of the day, when they were on the\nsubject of the Night\u2019s Watch and he finally asked what Jon was to her, she let\nout a long sigh.<br><br>\n\u201cI thought maybe I could have loved him, but he didn\u2019t feel\nthe same. When we could have had a chance, he decided to leave.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell, then, he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d<br><br>\nSansa gave a weak laugh. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really mean it, Sansa. You\u2019re\namazing. Smart, driven, kind. I love talking to you.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah?\u201d she asked, grinning like a fool.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I might not\nbe as smart as my brother Sam, but I\u2019m no idiot.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI mean, if I had a shot with you, Sansa, I wouldn\u2019t be fool\nenough to throw it away.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWho\u2019s to say you don\u2019t?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAre you saying that I do?\u201d<br><br>\nSansa inhaled sharply. \u201cI\u2019m saying that when I get back to\nRiverrun there\u2019s a bakery on Third Street I really like that makes lovely lemon\nscones.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI happen to love scones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then it\u2019s a date.\u201d<br><br><br><br></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Christmas came and went. As she grew older, Sansa cared less for presents and more for the opportunity to spend time with those she loved. But her parents did buy her a gorgeous hair pin shaped like a dragonfly that she wore on New Year\u2019s Eve, Bran got her some new books on rhetoric, politics, and intersectional feminism that she was eager to read, and Arya gave her a slip of paper that just read \u201cLater.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d she\u2019d asked when she pulled the piece\nof paper out of the plain box Arya had wrapped it in.<br><br>\n\u201cExactly what it says,\u201d was her sister\u2019s enigmatic reply.<br><br>\nLuckily, Robb\u2019s gift of fancy assorted teas and Rickon\u2019s\npresent, a novelty t-shirt that read \u2018You Can\u2019t Frighten Me,\u2019 didn\u2019t need as\nmuch explaining.<br><br>\nThey had a more subdued holiday season than usual. Robb was\nhome for only a short time, as he was busy with his internship and business\nschool applications. Now that she had been away for school herself, Sansa felt\nlike she could understood Rob and his business a bit better. She loved spending\ntime with her family, sleeping in her own room, and being back in Winterfell,\nbut she spent more time than usual on her phone texting to the group chat she,\nMeera, and Brienne had formed. It felt so strange, after spending every day\ntogether, not to see them. Robb knew what she felt right away. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like\nhaving two families,\u201d he explained. \u201cYour family at home, and the little family\nyou have at school. You just have to balance it.\u201d</p><p>Robb was right,\nand she settled back into home, such that it felt like her first semester away seemed\nlike a strange dream. Rickon got a cold, and then everyone did. Despite the\nillness, Bran was being quieter than usual, and Arya would go through fits of\nbeing wild and then sullen. Sansa spent a lot of the break with Ghost. Mr.\nMormont was taking a few days off to go visit his son and, knowing she was back\nin town, asked Sansa to keep an eye on Ghost. She was happy to do it. Being\naround Ghost was calming\u2014which she needed.<br><br>\nThey were all anxious to hear more news about Jon. He\u2019d been\ntransferred to a hospital nearby so that Mrs. Snow could visit him more easily.\nThere was no news about what that meant in terms of Jon\u2019s status with the\nNight\u2019s Watch. Robb reported that while the situation wasn\u2019t as life-or-death\nas it had been a few weeks before, Jon did need to have more surgery to help\ndeal with some of the eternal bleeding.<br><br>\nSurprisingly, it was Catelyn who suggested they all go visit\nhim in the hospital the day after his surgery.\u00a0<br><br>\nShe heard her parents discussing it in hushed voices after\ndinner. \u201cThey need to see that he\u2019s going to be okay. They need to see it for\nthemselves.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201c<br><br>\n\u201cHer too,\u201d Cat answered, and Sansa\u2019s stomach dropped when she\nrealized they were talking about her. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you can deal with\nthese types of things.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ned agreed with a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll go\u00a0tomorrow. I\u2019ll call Lyanna\nto let her know.\u201d<br><br>\nMost of Sansa\u2019s clothes were in her dorm room, so she had\nlimited options the next day. She didn\u2019t want to wear black\u2014didn\u2019t like how\nominous that seemed\u2014so she wore a warm dark blue sweater and her third nicest\npair of jeans. She was quiet on the way over\u2014and so forced herself to chat with\nRickon about what weapon she\u2019d bring with her to the zombie apocalypse. He was\nunimpressed when she told him her brain, because he was obsessed with the\nkatana, but she felt she made a compelling case; it was a good distraction,\neither way.<br><br>\nWhen they made their way to Jon\u2019s room and the nurse told\nthem that only three visitors were allowed at a time, Sansa sank into the\nhorrible waiting room wallpaper, allowing her younger siblings to go first. She\ndid her best not to fidget and tried to be as consumed by last year\u2019s fashion\nmagazines as she hoped her face portrayed.<br><br>\nHer parents went next, and then she had more trouble keeping\nher hands from fidgeting and her pulse from quickening. When they returned to\nthe waiting room, her father approached her. \u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d Ned said softly.\n\u201cDo you still want to\u2014?\u201d<br><br>\nShe nodded. \u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d<br><br>\nSansa shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d<br><br>\nShe found his room easily enough and tried her best to keep\nher knees from shaking.\u00a0<br><br>\nJon was lying in bed, asleep like her father had said. The\nsight of him took her breath away. His skin looked sallow, his face too thin.\nHis beautiful hair was gone, cropped tightly to his head. When she stepped\ncloser, she could see a dark red scar that trailed his left eye.</p><p><br>\nShe sat down in the chair next to his bed so she could study\nhim more. His chest was covered by a standard hospital gown, but she could spy\nheavy gauze beneath it. He looked awful, but he was breathing, slow and steady.\nShe concentrated on the sound of his breaths and the movement of his chest. And\nshe prayed to the gods\u2014the old ones her father kept\u2014and asked them to heal him,\nmake him strong again.<br><br>\nShe was so wrapped up in her prayers that she didn\u2019t notice\nsomeone else had entered the room until she heard her name being called.<br><br>\nShe tore her eyes away to see Mrs. Snow. Sansa immediately\nrose to her feet. \u201cHi.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHello.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for all you must be going through.\u201d<br><br>\nLyanna gave her a weak smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d She gazed over at\nJon. \u201cThat boy is my whole world. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if I lost\nhim.\u201d<br><br>\nSansa didn\u2019t know what to say, so she just nodded. Even under\nmore normal circumstances, she\u2019d never known quite what to say to Mrs. Snow.\nWhen she was younger, she\u2019d always been wary of her because her mother didn\u2019t\nlike Lyanna for some unspoken reason. But Sansa could sense the tension between\nthe two women, and she\u2019d loyally taken her mother\u2019s side. Then, when she grew\nolder and her crush on Jon had bloomed, she\u2019d worried that Mrs. Snow wouldn\u2019t\nlike her\u2014that she\u2019d think her too prissy or unworthy or childish. When Jon had\nleft, she\u2019d maintained her avoidance because Mrs. Snow\u2019s eyes looked far too\nmuch like her son\u2019s.<br><br>\nSansa fidgeted with her hands. \u201cI should get going. My family\nis waiting.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThank you for coming.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOf course. Everyone was worried when we hear the news. When\nI heard\u2014I\u2014we were all worried. We all care about Jon.\u201d<br><br>\nMrs. Snow sighed and eyed her sympathetically. \u201cI see that\nnow. I didn\u2019t before. I\u2014I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d<br><br>\nSansa gave her a puzzled smile, bid her goodbye, and left the\nroom as quickly as she could. When she made her way back to the waiting room,\nshe felt drained.\u00a0<br><br>\nArya must have noticed because as soon as she crossed the\nthreshold her little sister took Sansa\u2019s hand and flashed her keys.<br><br>\n\u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAbsolutely no idea.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s later.\u201d<br><br>\nLater apparently meant driving to a tattoo parlor,\ndiscovering that Arya, despite being only sixteen and a half, had acquired a\nfake ID, and being sweet-talked into getting matching wolf tattoos on their\narms.\u00a0<br><br>\n\u201cWe need to do this!\u201d Arya insisted.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, actually, we really don\u2019t.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Sansa. Be brave!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI am brave.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBe bold.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHave you seen my shoe collection?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBe spontaneous!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd live to regret it?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about matching wolves, Sansa? How could you ever\nregret a sign that you\u2019re part of the pack?\u201d<br><br>\nSansa could not convince Arya that her scheme was a poor one,\nbut she did at least get Arya to agree to a smaller, less menacing design. They\nsettled on the outline of the sigil from the centuries-old Stark family crest.\nArya\u2019s asked for her teeth to be a little more pronounced, and Sansa asked for\nthe eye of her wolf\u2019s profile to be red and for the fur to look perfectly\ncombed, so she could honor both Ghost and Lady.<br><br>\nArya wanted to get hers on her arm, but Sansa didn\u2019t want\nhers to be as easily visible.<br><br>\n\u201cJust don\u2019t get it on your hip,\u201d Arya insisted. \u201cDon\u2019t be\nthat girl.\u201d<br><br>\nSansa rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong with being that\ngirl?\u201d But in the end, she chose her left shoulder blade.<br><br>\nThe process was long and painful\u2014more painful than Sansa had\nsupposed. She gripped Arya\u2019s hand the entire time, doing her best not to curse\nher little sister out with each sting of the needle.<br><br>\n\u201cRemind me never to accept a gift from you,\u201d she said with\ngritted teeth.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon. Every hurt is a lesson.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m smart enough,\u201d Sansa grumbled.\u00a0<br><br>\nThirty minutes later, though, when the blood had been cleared away and the pain\nhad numbed, Sansa stared at their tattoos in awe.\u00a0<br><br>\n\u201cWorth it, huh?\u201d Arya preened.<br><br>\n\u201cOh, shut it,\u201d replied Sansa, suppressing a smile and\nsneaking another look at her tattoo in the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s\ntelling Mom.\u201d<br><br><br>\nThey were both punished for the rest of Sansa\u2019s break, though\nthe recent drama seemed to give them somewhat of a reprieve. Cat could not\nbelieve that they both had tarnished their beautiful skin, and Ned had agreed,\nthough privately praised them for choosing the Stark sigil.<br><br></p><p>Margaery had been beside herself\nwhen Sansa showed her. \u201cLook at you, Sansa Stark, badass extraordinaire.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had glowed under the\npraise. </p><p><br>\nWhen she returned to school, she felt like she was carrying a\nsecret no one knew but her and her sister. She quite liked that feeling.\u00a0<br><br>\nCollege life was going well. She, Meera, and Brienne seemed\nto grow closer every day, and her classes became more and more interesting.\nWhen the spring semester ended, she was sad to leave the little family she\u2019d\ncreated. But like Robb had said, it was all about balance. And though\nshe was sad to leave her friends for a few months, she was overjoyed to be back\nwith her family. After Robb\u2019s college graduation, he had a few weeks before he\nneeded to start getting ready for business school to spend relaxing. And the\nStark siblings went hard. </p><p>They played every board game they\nowned, the watched every favorite film\u2014\u2018A Dance with Dragons\u2019 included, they\nate their favorite meals and stayed up late telling the ghost stories Nan used\nto scare them with when they were little. It was a great summer\u2014which made it\nbittersweet to go back to Riverrun to reunite with her friends. <br><br>\nSophomore year presented new challenges. After hearing about\ntrafficking incidents at the nearby Frey University and a #MeToo scandal\nconcerning a Professor Petyr Baelish in the Political Science department, Sansa\nlaunched herself into Take By the Night and women\u2019s leadership groups. Brienne\ngot involved by hosting free self-defense classes, and Meera designed rape\nwhistles to pass out to students on campus.\u00a0<br><br>\nThrough her work, Sansa became really good friends with a\ngirl named Gilly, who admitted late one night that she\u2019d been molested by her\nown father. That\u2019s when Sansa started volunteering at Riverrun\u2019s counseling\ncenter.<br><br>\nThinking she could do more, Sansa began to consider whether\nshe should go into law, where maybe she could help to shape better policy for\nwomen and survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. Toward the end of her\nsophomore year, Sansa joined the pre-law society, and that\u2019s where she met\nDickon.<br><br>\nShe hadn\u2019t been looking to start a new relationship. She had\nher friends and school and her family and her volunteer work. Apart from a\none-time fumble with Podrick, which they\u2019d both agreed was a mistake and he\u2019d\nonly recently been able to look her in the eye again, Sansa hadn\u2019t had pursued\nmuch in terms of romance.<br><br>\nAnd Dickon was a couple years older than her, already\nenrolled in the Riverrun law program and helping mentor younger students. And\nhe was devastatingly handsome. Thick light brown hair, full lips, strong jaw,\neven stronger shoulders. His physique, combined with his general affability,\nreminded her a bit of Hercules from the Disney movie, and that was very\ndangerous.<br><br>\nHe\u2019d revealed to her one afternoon as they were waiting in\nline for the free cookies that he\u2019d been a swimmer in high school and kept it\nup to relieve stress.<br><br>\nAnd as much as Sansa wanted to lick whatever stress he felt\naway, she was hesitant to give in too much to his flirtations. Dickon was sweet\nand considerate and had wonderfully sexy dimples.<br><br>\nHe made her heart skip sometimes, in a way she hadn\u2019t felt\nsince Edric. But her relationship with Edric had been so good\u2014and it had ended\nso well. Could she really be so lucky again? She doubted it. Dickon made her\nnervous precisely because he seemed so safe. He was a protector, and Sansa\ndidn\u2019t want to feel like she needed protecting.<br><br>\nBut when he asked if he could have her number so he could\ncall her over the summer, she gave it to him, figuring he wouldn\u2019t remember to\ndo so anyway.<br><br>\nBut he did. Several times\u2026to the point that he called every\nfew days. He didn\u2019t monopolize her day, but he told her about how his\ninternship was going and asked about her day. He loved to hear stories about\nArya because he said he missed his own little sister.</p><p>His laugh was full, like she\ncould hear it coming out of his throat. His voice was deep and sure, and it was\neasy to feel a bit lost in it.<br><br>\nDuring these calls, she found out that he was a lot more than\njust devastatingly handsome. He told her how he wanted to be a lawyer so he\ncould work as an advocate for the environment and how he stressed about what\nhis super conservative dad would say when he explained he wasn\u2019t going to go\ninto corporate law. He seemed genuinely supportive of her desire to help\nwomen and survivors of abuse and told her how much he wished his sister had a\nrole model like her.<br><br>\nHe talked about his older brother, too, who was a medic for\nthe Night\u2019s Watch and how much he worried about him.<br><br>\nAnd hearing Dickon say that, Sansa felt she could tell him\nshe knew someone in the Night\u2019s Watch too. And that he\u2019d gotten badly wounded\nand was still in rehab last she heard. And how she\u2019d worried about him all the\ntime, but particularly on late quiet nights when she didn\u2019t know if he was\nalive or dead. And how finding out he\u2019d been wounded was horrifying, but\nhorribly, she found she was a tiny bit grateful for it, because now she knew he\nwas safe.<br><br>\nAnd one night, while she was taking a walk to clear her mind\nafter having visited Ghost for the majority of the day, when they were on the\nsubject of the Night\u2019s Watch and he finally asked what Jon was to her, she let\nout a long sigh.<br><br>\n\u201cI thought maybe I could have loved him, but he didn\u2019t feel\nthe same. When we could have had a chance, he decided to leave.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell, then, he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d<br><br>\nSansa gave a weak laugh. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really mean it, Sansa. You\u2019re\namazing. Smart, driven, kind.

                "content": "<p>Christmas came and went. As she grew older, Sansa cared less for presents and more for the opportunity to spend time with those she loved. But her parents did buy her a gorgeous hair pin shaped like a dragonfly that she wore on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, Bran got her some new books on rhetoric, politics, and intersectional feminism that she was eager to read, and Arya gave her a slip of paper that just read &ldquo;Later.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; she&rsquo;d asked when she pulled the piece\nof paper out of the plain box Arya had wrapped it in.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Exactly what it says,&rdquo; was her sister&rsquo;s enigmatic reply.<br /><br />\nLuckily, Robb&rsquo;s gift of fancy assorted teas and Rickon&rsquo;s\npresent, a novelty t-shirt that read &lsquo;You Can&rsquo;t Frighten Me,&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t need as\nmuch explaining.<br /><br />\nThey had a more subdued holiday season than usual. Robb was\nhome for only a short time, as he was busy with his internship and business\nschool applications. Now that she had been away for school herself, Sansa felt\nlike she could understood Rob and his business a bit better. She loved spending\ntime with her family, sleeping in her own room, and being back in Winterfell,\nbut she spent more time than usual on her phone texting to the group chat she,\nMeera, and Brienne had formed. It felt so strange, after spending every day\ntogether, not to see them. Robb knew what she felt right away. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit like\nhaving two families,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Your family at home, and the little family\nyou have at school. You just have to balance it.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb was right,\nand she settled back into home, such that it felt like her first semester away seemed\nlike a strange dream. Rickon got a cold, and then everyone did. Despite the\nillness, Bran was being quieter than usual, and Arya would go through fits of\nbeing wild and then sullen. Sansa spent a lot of the break with Ghost. Mr.\nMormont was taking a few days off to go visit his son and, knowing she was back\nin town, asked Sansa to keep an eye on Ghost. She was happy to do it. Being\naround Ghost was calming&mdash;which she needed.<br /><br />\nThey were all anxious to hear more news about Jon. He&rsquo;d been\ntransferred to a hospital nearby so that Mrs. Snow could visit him more easily.\nThere was no news about what that meant in terms of Jon&rsquo;s status with the\nNight&rsquo;s Watch. Robb reported that while the situation wasn&rsquo;t as life-or-death\nas it had been a few weeks before, Jon did need to have more surgery to help\ndeal with some of the eternal bleeding.<br /><br />\nSurprisingly, it was Catelyn who suggested they all go visit\nhim in the hospital the day after his surgery.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nShe heard her parents discussing it in hushed voices after\ndinner. &ldquo;They need to see that he&rsquo;s going to be okay. They need to see it for\nthemselves.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;But what about&mdash;&ldquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Her too,&rdquo; Cat answered, and Sansa&rsquo;s stomach dropped when she\nrealized they were talking about her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way you can deal with\nthese types of things.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Ned agreed with a sigh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go&nbsp;tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll call Lyanna\nto let her know.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nMost of Sansa&rsquo;s clothes were in her dorm room, so she had\nlimited options the next day. She didn&rsquo;t want to wear black&mdash;didn&rsquo;t like how\nominous that seemed&mdash;so she wore a warm dark blue sweater and her third nicest\npair of jeans. She was quiet on the way over&mdash;and so forced herself to chat with\nRickon about what weapon she&rsquo;d bring with her to the zombie apocalypse. He was\nunimpressed when she told him her brain, because he was obsessed with the\nkatana, but she felt she made a compelling case; it was a good distraction,\neither way.<br /><br />\nWhen they made their way to Jon&rsquo;s room and the nurse told\nthem that only three visitors were allowed at a time, Sansa sank into the\nhorrible waiting room wallpaper, allowing her younger siblings to go first. She\ndid her best not to fidget and tried to be as consumed by last year&rsquo;s fashion\nmagazines as she hoped her face portrayed.<br /><br />\nHer parents went next, and then she had more trouble keeping\nher hands from fidgeting and her pulse from quickening. When they returned to\nthe waiting room, her father approached her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; Ned said softly.\n&ldquo;Do you still want to&mdash;?&rdquo;<br /><br />\nShe nodded. &ldquo;Do you want me to come with you?&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSansa shook her head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nShe found his room easily enough and tried her best to keep\nher knees from shaking.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nJon was lying in bed, asleep like her father had said. The\nsight of him took her breath away. His skin looked sallow, his face too thin.\nHis beautiful hair was gone, cropped tightly to his head. When she stepped\ncloser, she could see a dark red scar that trailed his left eye.</p><p><br />\nShe sat down in the chair next to his bed so she could study\nhim more. His chest was covered by a standard hospital gown, but she could spy\nheavy gauze beneath it. He looked awful, but he was breathing, slow and steady.\nShe concentrated on the sound of his breaths and the movement of his chest. And\nshe prayed to the gods&mdash;the old ones her father kept&mdash;and asked them to heal him,\nmake him strong again.<br /><br />\nShe was so wrapped up in her prayers that she didn&rsquo;t notice\nsomeone else had entered the room until she heard her name being called.<br /><br />\nShe tore her eyes away to see Mrs. Snow. Sansa immediately\nrose to her feet. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for all you must be going through.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nLyanna gave her a weak smile. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She gazed over at\nJon. &ldquo;That boy is my whole world. I don&rsquo;t know what I would&rsquo;ve done if I lost\nhim.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSansa didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so she just nodded. Even under\nmore normal circumstances, she&rsquo;d never known quite what to say to Mrs. Snow.\nWhen she was younger, she&rsquo;d always been wary of her because her mother didn&rsquo;t\nlike Lyanna for some unspoken reason. But Sansa could sense the tension between\nthe two women, and she&rsquo;d loyally taken her mother&rsquo;s side. Then, when she grew\nolder and her crush on Jon had bloomed, she&rsquo;d worried that Mrs. Snow wouldn&rsquo;t\nlike her&mdash;that she&rsquo;d think her too prissy or unworthy or childish. When Jon had\nleft, she&rsquo;d maintained her avoidance because Mrs. Snow&rsquo;s eyes looked far too\nmuch like her son&rsquo;s.<br /><br />\nSansa fidgeted with her hands. &ldquo;I should get going. My family\nis waiting.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Thank you for coming.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Of course. Everyone was worried when we hear the news. When\nI heard&mdash;I&mdash;we were all worried. We all care about Jon.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nMrs. Snow sighed and eyed her sympathetically. &ldquo;I see that\nnow. I didn&rsquo;t before. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry for that.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSansa gave her a puzzled smile, bid her goodbye, and left the\nroom as quickly as she could. When she made her way back to the waiting room,\nshe felt drained.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nArya must have noticed because as soon as she crossed the\nthreshold her little sister took Sansa&rsquo;s hand and flashed her keys.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Do you know what time it is?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Absolutely no idea.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s later.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nLater apparently meant driving to a tattoo parlor,\ndiscovering that Arya, despite being only sixteen and a half, had acquired a\nfake ID, and being sweet-talked into getting matching wolf tattoos on their\narms.&nbsp;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;We need to do this!&rdquo; Arya insisted.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;No, actually, we really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Sansa. Be brave!&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I am brave.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Be bold.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Have you seen my shoe collection?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Be spontaneous!&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;And live to regret it?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about matching wolves, Sansa? How could you ever\nregret a sign that you&rsquo;re part of the pack?&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSansa could not convince Arya that her scheme was a poor one,\nbut she did at least get Arya to agree to a smaller, less menacing design. They\nsettled on the outline of the sigil from the centuries-old Stark family crest.\nArya&rsquo;s asked for her teeth to be a little more pronounced, and Sansa asked for\nthe eye of her wolf&rsquo;s profile to be red and for the fur to look perfectly\ncombed, so she could honor both Ghost and Lady.<br /><br />\nArya wanted to get hers on her arm, but Sansa didn&rsquo;t want\nhers to be as easily visible.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t get it on your hip,&rdquo; Arya insisted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be\nthat girl.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSansa rolled her eyes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so wrong with being that\ngirl?&rdquo; But in the end, she chose her left shoulder blade.<br /><br />\nThe process was long and painful&mdash;more painful than Sansa had\nsupposed. She gripped Arya&rsquo;s hand the entire time, doing her best not to curse\nher little sister out with each sting of the needle.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Remind me never to accept a gift from you,&rdquo; she said with\ngritted teeth.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be over soon. Every hurt is a lesson.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m smart enough,&rdquo; Sansa grumbled.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nThirty minutes later, though, when the blood had been cleared away and the pain\nhad numbed, Sansa stared at their tattoos in awe.&nbsp;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Worth it, huh?&rdquo; Arya preened.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Oh, shut it,&rdquo; replied Sansa, suppressing a smile and\nsneaking another look at her tattoo in the mirror. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s\ntelling Mom.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />\nThey were both punished for the rest of Sansa&rsquo;s break, though\nthe recent drama seemed to give them somewhat of a reprieve. Cat could not\nbelieve that they both had tarnished their beautiful skin, and Ned had agreed,\nthough privately praised them for choosing the Stark sigil.<br /><br /></p><p>Margaery had been beside herself\nwhen Sansa showed her. &ldquo;Look at you, Sansa Stark, badass extraordinaire.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa had glowed under the\npraise. </p><p><br />\nWhen she returned to school, she felt like she was carrying a\nsecret no one knew but her and her sister. She quite liked that feeling.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nCollege life was going well. She, Meera, and Brienne seemed\nto grow closer every day, and her classes became more and more interesting.\nWhen the spring semester ended, she was sad to leave the little family she&rsquo;d\ncreated. But like Robb had said, it was all about balance. And though\nshe was sad to leave her friends for a few months, she was overjoyed to be back\nwith her family. After Robb&rsquo;s college graduation, he had a few weeks before he\nneeded to start getting ready for business school to spend relaxing. And the\nStark siblings went hard. </p><p>They played every board game they\nowned, the watched every favorite film&mdash;&lsquo;A Dance with Dragons&rsquo; included, they\nate their favorite meals and stayed up late telling the ghost stories Nan used\nto scare them with when they were little. It was a great summer&mdash;which made it\nbittersweet to go back to Riverrun to reunite with her friends. <br /><br />\nSophomore year presented new challenges. After hearing about\ntrafficking incidents at the nearby Frey University and a #MeToo scandal\nconcerning a Professor Petyr Baelish in the Political Science department, Sansa\nlaunched herself into Take By the Night and women&rsquo;s leadership groups. Brienne\ngot involved by hosting free self-defense classes, and Meera designed rape\nwhistles to pass out to students on campus.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nThrough her work, Sansa became really good friends with a\ngirl named Gilly, who admitted late one night that she&rsquo;d been molested by her\nown father. That&rsquo;s when Sansa started volunteering at Riverrun&rsquo;s counseling\ncenter.<br /><br />\nThinking she could do more, Sansa began to consider whether\nshe should go into law, where maybe she could help to shape better policy for\nwomen and survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. Toward the end of her\nsophomore year, Sansa joined the pre-law society, and that&rsquo;s where she met\nDickon.<br /><br />\nShe hadn&rsquo;t been looking to start a new relationship. She had\nher friends and school and her family and her volunteer work. Apart from a\none-time fumble with Podrick, which they&rsquo;d both agreed was a mistake and he&rsquo;d\nonly recently been able to look her in the eye again, Sansa hadn&rsquo;t had pursued\nmuch in terms of romance.<br /><br />\nAnd Dickon was a couple years older than her, already\nenrolled in the Riverrun law program and helping mentor younger students. And\nhe was devastatingly handsome. Thick light brown hair, full lips, strong jaw,\neven stronger shoulders. His physique, combined with his general affability,\nreminded her a bit of Hercules from the Disney movie, and that was very\ndangerous.<br /><br />\nHe&rsquo;d revealed to her one afternoon as they were waiting in\nline for the free cookies that he&rsquo;d been a swimmer in high school and kept it\nup to relieve stress.<br /><br />\nAnd as much as Sansa wanted to lick whatever stress he felt\naway, she was hesitant to give in too much to his flirtations. Dickon was sweet\nand considerate and had wonderfully sexy dimples.<br /><br />\nHe made her heart skip sometimes, in a way she hadn&rsquo;t felt\nsince Edric. But her relationship with Edric had been so good&mdash;and it had ended\nso well. Could she really be so lucky again? She doubted it. Dickon made her\nnervous precisely because he seemed so safe. He was a protector, and Sansa\ndidn&rsquo;t want to feel like she needed protecting.<br /><br />\nBut when he asked if he could have her number so he could\ncall her over the summer, she gave it to him, figuring he wouldn&rsquo;t remember to\ndo so anyway.<br /><br />\nBut he did. Several times&hellip;to the point that he called every\nfew days. He didn&rsquo;t monopolize her day, but he told her about how his\ninternship was going and asked about her day. He loved to hear stories about\nArya because he said he missed his own little sister.</p><p>His laugh was full, like she\ncould hear it coming out of his throat. His voice was deep and sure, and it was\neasy to feel a bit lost in it.<br /><br />\nDuring these calls, she found out that he was a lot more than\njust devastatingly handsome. He told her how he wanted to be a lawyer so he\ncould work as an advocate for the environment and how he stressed about what\nhis super conservative dad would say when he explained he wasn&rsquo;t going to go\ninto corporate law. He seemed genuinely supportive of her desire to help\nwomen and survivors of abuse and told her how much he wished his sister had a\nrole model like her.<br /><br />\nHe talked about his older brother, too, who was a medic for\nthe Night&rsquo;s Watch and how much he worried about him.<br /><br />\nAnd hearing Dickon say that, Sansa felt she could tell him\nshe knew someone in the Night&rsquo;s Watch too. And that he&rsquo;d gotten badly wounded\nand was still in rehab last she heard. And how she&rsquo;d worried about him all the\ntime, but particularly on late quiet nights when she didn&rsquo;t know if he was\nalive or dead. And how finding out he&rsquo;d been wounded was horrifying, but\nhorribly, she found she was a tiny bit grateful for it, because now she knew he\nwas safe.<br /><br />\nAnd one night, while she was taking a walk to clear her mind\nafter having visited Ghost for the majority of the day, when they were on the\nsubject of the Night&rsquo;s Watch and he finally asked what Jon was to her, she let\nout a long sigh.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I thought maybe I could have loved him, but he didn&rsquo;t feel\nthe same. When we could have had a chance, he decided to leave.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Well, then, he&rsquo;s an idiot.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSansa gave a weak laugh. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really mean it, Sansa. You&rsquo;re\namazing. Smart, driven, kind. I love talking to you.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; she asked, grinning like a fool.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I might not\nbe as smart as my brother Sam, but I&rsquo;m no idiot.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I mean, if I had a shot with you, Sansa, I wouldn&rsquo;t be fool\nenough to throw it away.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to say you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Are you saying that I do?&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSansa inhaled sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that when I get back to\nRiverrun there&rsquo;s a bakery on Third Street I really like that makes lovely lemon\nscones.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I happen to love scones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Then it&rsquo;s a date.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>",
