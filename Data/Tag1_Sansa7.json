Yet.<br/></small></p><p><i><small>Modern AU // Fake Dating AU</small></i></p></blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;</b>O no\u2026\u201d Sansa shook her head in absolute disbelief when she saw Joffrey Baratheon enter the club with an air of confidence surrounding him. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening.\u201d She downed her still half full glass of wine and quickly she reached for another one. She needed more alcohol. And she desperately needed that boyfriend she had been bragging about every time Joffrey had texted her to ask if there was really no way he could make it up to her.</p><p>The only problem was that that boyfriend she had been bragging about didn\u2019t really exist.</p><p>As soon as he saw her Joffrey\u2019s eyes widened and Sansa felt pearls of sweat covering her forehead. </p><p>She had to do something and she had to do something now. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d She curled her fingers around the wrist of the boy standing next to her. \u201cCan you pretend to be my boyfriend, please?\u201d She kept one eye on the unknown boy and one eye on her ex who was now walking across the dance floor, each step carrying him closer and closer towards her. \u201cI&rsquo;ll pay your drinks for the rest of the evening.\u201d She didn\u2019t give him the chance to say no. </p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d </p><p>She grabbed the stranger\u2019s hand and entwined their fingers. \u201cJoffrey!\u201d She forced herself to smile at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while. What are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t miss Margaery Tyrell\u2019s birthday party, can I?\u201d Joffrey placed his hands on her shoulders and his wet lips pecked her cheeks. </p><p>The urge to throw up was almost overwhelming, but she was not gonna show him that he still had that kind of power over her, that he still had some kind of power over her, that he still had any kind of power over her. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAnd I actually hoped to finally see you again too.\u201d Joffrey stepped back and he furrowed his eyebrows when he looked at the stranger next to Sansa. \u201cI guess this is the boyfriend you\u2019ve dumped me for?\u201d His eyes shamelessly wandered over the young man\u2019s body and Sansa followed his glance.</p><p>The stranger was actually quite handsome. His long black curls were tied into a bun and his broad shoulders implied that he was part of some sports team.

I really thought he loved me, but\u2026\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he even knows what love is. He just wanted to posses me.
