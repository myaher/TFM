I think it\u2019s really hard to beat Everything Has Changed by Taylor Swift.\u00a0</p><p>I hate to say that because choosing a love song by Taylor Swift feels like such a basic answer. But I already think that song is one of the best lighthearted crush songs, and I think there\u2019s a lot of lyrics that work from both TJ and Cyrus\u2019 perspectives and that the general theme of\u00a0\u201ceverything has changed\u201d really fits their relationship well.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\u201cAll I\u2019ve seen since eighteen hours ago is green eyes, and freckles, and your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like I just want to know you better.\u201d\u00a0</b></i></p></blockquote><p>I would apply this to how Cyrus felt after they first talked at the swings. Cyrus didn\u2019t immediately recognize that he was developing feelings for TJ, but he did want to get to know him better. I would almost describe him as fascinated by the entire interaction. Immediately following it, Cyrus texted Andi about it how he and TJ helped each other feel better, and how he could see that there was more to TJ than meets the eye. And he clearly spent some time thinking about TJ, because the very next episode he shows up at school prepared to invite TJ to his Bar Mitzvah, and is later concerned enough to check up on him at the basketball game - both of which are clear signs of wanting to get to know someone better. And of course, TJ has green eyes and we mostly see him smile around Cyrus - so the details make sense too.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\u201cAll my walls stood tall, painted blue, but I\u2019ll take them down and open up the door for you.\u201d</b></i></p></blockquote><p>I would apply this to how TJ felt when they first talked at the swings, and when they talked during the basketball game. TJ had been building up walls and pushing people away for who knows how long. He had built up this reputation as being tough and unapproachable as a way of protecting himself, but the second that Cyrus came into his life - he started showing vulnerability. Every time that TJ started to open up about his\u00a0\u201cstuff\u201d to Cyrus - he was taking down those walls.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\u201cAnd all I feel in my stomach is butterflies. The beautiful kind, making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like I just want to know you better\u201d</b></i></p></blockquote><p>I think that this is one of the most accurate and universal descriptions of what it feels like when you have a crush, so I definitely think that both TJ and Cyrus would relate to it. It\u2019s soft and innocent and it\u2019s what a middle school crush feels like before there is any drama or angst involved, or before you\u2019re even sure that it is a crush. You just know that this person makes you feel different, and that you want to explore it further.\u00a0</p><p>I also particularly like the part that says\u00a0\u201cmaking up for lost time\u201d in regards to their relationship, as I think that\u2019s a very common feeling for people in the LGBTQ+ community. A lot of gay people start dating later than their friends, or don\u2019t recognize that their crushes <i>are</i> crushes until further down the road. With both TJ and Cyrus being so emotionally closed off in their own ways, I think they probably both feel like they\u2019ve been missing out on some experiences.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\u201cCome back and tell me why I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019ve missed you all this time. Meet me there tonight, and let me know that it\u2019s not all in my mind.\u201d</b></i></p></blockquote><p>I think the bridge of the song has become even more accurate since the costume day fiasco. I can imagine both TJ and Cyrus relating to these lines. They still convey that feeling of a light middle school crush, but there is an undertone of angst to it now. Cyrus feels like TJ has abandoned him, so the idea of him saying\u00a0\u201ccome back\u201d feels natural at this point. The line\u00a0\u201c<i>tell me why I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019ve missed you all this time</i>\u201d could be said from either of their perspectives. They are both missing each other and how things were, and the use of\u00a0\u201call this time\u201d really makes it feel like they could <i>just now </i>be recognizing how they\u2019ve felt all along.</p><p>I love the fact that the song says\u00a0\u201cmeet me there\u201d because it sounds so personal, like the person who the song is for knows <i>where </i>they should meet without it having to be said - which in the case of Cyrus and TJ, would obviously mean the swings. And I can easily imagine both Cyrus and TJ questioning what everything means, questioning if what they were feeling and experiencing was real or if they were imagining it.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cAll I know is we said hello, so dust off your highest hopes. All I know is pouring rain, and everything has changed. All I know is a new found grace. All my days, I\u2019ll know your face. All I know since yesterday is everything has changed.\u201d</i></b></p></blockquote><p>\u201cAll I know is pouring rain, and everything has changed\u201d is such a beautiful way to describe how Cyrus and TJ have changed each other\u2019s lives since they started talking. Think back to Cyrus saying\u00a0\u201c<i>He wants to be friends with me - who knows why</i>\u201d, or TJ saying\u00a0\u201c<i>Anything good, I gotta ruin it</i>\u201d. They are so used to feeling unloved, to things going wrong for them, to the \u201cpouring rain\u201d, that they had no reason to hope or expect things to go right. But things have changed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAll my days, I\u2019ll know your face\u201d reminds me of Cyrus telling Jonah\u00a0\u201c<i>that\u2019s just his face</i>\u201d about TJ appearing to be mean. I always liked that line, because when Cyrus says it - you can almost see him picturing TJ\u2019s face as he says it. Between that, and how many times we\u2019ve watched them make eye contact - it feels like they really pay attention to small details about each other. That they <i>know </i>each other, down to their facial expressions.<br/></p><p>And of course - the idea of\u00a0\u201ceverything has changed\u201d is the perfect way to describe TJ and Cyrus\u2019 relationship thus far. In a literal sense, everything changed for the better once they became friends, and now everything has changed for the worst following costume day. In a more metaphorical sense-\u00a0 Cyrus has changed things for TJ by helping him be more vulnerable, by inspiring him to better himself, and by encouraging to accept himself as he is. TJ has changed things for Cyrus by pushing him out of his comfort zone and inspiring him to stand up for himself and recognize his own worth. They have made things change for each other by simply caring about each other.\u00a0</p>",

You just know that this person makes you feel different, and that you want to explore it further.\u00a0</p><p>I also particularly like the part that says\u00a0\u201cmaking up for lost time\u201d in regards to their relationship, as I think that\u2019s a very common feeling for people in the LGBTQ+ community. A lot of gay people start dating later than their friends, or don\u2019t recognize that their crushes <i>are</i> crushes until further down the road. With both TJ and Cyrus being so emotionally closed off in their own ways, I think they probably both feel like they\u2019ve been missing out on some experiences.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\u201cCome back and tell me why I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019ve missed you all this time. Meet me there tonight, and let me know that it\u2019s not all in my mind.\u201d</b></i></p></blockquote><p>I think the bridge of the song has become even more accurate since the costume day fiasco. I can imagine both TJ and Cyrus relating to these lines. They still convey that feeling of a light middle school crush, but there is an undertone of angst to it now. Cyrus feels like TJ has abandoned him, so the idea of him saying\u00a0\u201ccome back\u201d feels natural at this point. The line\u00a0\u201c<i>tell me why I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019ve missed you all this time</i>\u201d could be said from either of their perspectives. They are both missing each other and how things were, and the use of\u00a0\u201call this time\u201d really makes it feel like they could <i>just now </i>be recognizing how they\u2019ve felt all along.</p><p>I love the fact that the song says\u00a0\u201cmeet me there\u201d because it sounds so personal, like the person who the song is for knows <i>where </i>they should meet without it having to be said - which in the case of Cyrus and TJ, would obviously mean the swings. And I can easily imagine both Cyrus and TJ questioning what everything means, questioning if what they were feeling and experiencing was real or if they were imagining it.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cAll I know is we said hello, so dust off your highest hopes. All I know is pouring rain, and everything has changed. All I know is a new found grace. All my days, I\u2019ll know your face. All I know since yesterday is everything has changed.\u201d</i></b></p></blockquote><p>\u201cAll I know is pouring rain, and everything has changed\u201d is such a beautiful way to describe how Cyrus and TJ have changed each other\u2019s lives since they started talking. Think back to Cyrus saying\u00a0\u201c<i>He wants to be friends with me - who knows why</i>\u201d, or TJ saying\u00a0\u201c<i>Anything good, I gotta ruin it</i>\u201d. They are so used to feeling unloved, to things going wrong for them, to the \u201cpouring rain\u201d, that they had no reason to hope or expect things to go right. But things have changed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAll my days, I\u2019ll know your face\u201d reminds me of Cyrus telling Jonah\u00a0\u201c<i>that\u2019s just his face</i>\u201d about TJ appearing to be mean. I always liked that line, because when Cyrus says it - you can almost see him picturing TJ\u2019s face as he says it. Between that, and how many times we\u2019ve watched them make eye contact - it feels like they really pay attention to small details about each other. That they <i>know </i>each other, down to their facial expressions.<br></p><p>And of course - the idea of\u00a0\u201ceverything has changed\u201d is the perfect way to describe TJ and Cyrus\u2019 relationship thus far. In a literal sense, everything changed for the better once they became friends, and now everything has changed for the worst following costume day. In a more metaphorical sense-\u00a0 Cyrus has changed things for TJ by helping him be more vulnerable, by inspiring him to better himself, and by encouraging to accept himself as he is. TJ has changed things for Cyrus by pushing him out of his comfort zone and inspiring him to stand up for himself and recognize his own worth. They have made things change for each other by simply caring about each other.\u00a0</p>",
