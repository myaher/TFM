She approached the slide but before she could hop on it, a hand grabbed her and started running with her towards the exit opposite of the one she came in with her mom. She let a scream out; her mom stood up as if the bench was burning her bottom. She started screaming, too. &ldquo;Annie!&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t see her.

He funnily ran towards the man, yelling at him to let the girl go.

He then proceeded to run twice as fast, without looking back, hoping to simply vanish from sight.</p><p>The man with the long black hair immediately stopped and stood on top of the little girl who was now calling for her mommy with an empty expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to her, do not worry. You are safe&rdquo;. He took her hand, and as he saw her head tilting he felt sorry for her. As the screams of the mother grew nearer and nearer, they started going faster, as if they were medicine and her agony was pain.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God Annie! Who took you? What happened? I&rsquo;m so sorry baby, mom will never leave you again!&rdquo; Her friend was a few steps behind, looking relieved and puzzled by the tall man&rsquo;s presence.

The crying woman stared at him and after a few seconds of silence, she asked him: &ldquo;Are y- are you Severus Snape?&rdquo; The man was startled. &ldquo;Why, yes. It is I. There&rsquo;s no need to thank m-&rdquo; The woman interrupted him immediately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never thank a toad killer. You only saved her because you felt guilty of your own past&rdquo;.
