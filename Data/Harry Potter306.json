The art was so good, I had to write a corresponding story.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he see in her, anyway?\u201d Seamus muttered, angrily flipping through his potions book, uncaring that he was ripping several pages by doing so.<br/></p><p>Harry\u2019s ears pricked and his face reddened.</p><p>\u201cRedheaded, scarlet little witch. Like there aren\u2019t plenty of redheads around. What makes her so interesting?\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he glanced at Seamus from the corner of his vision, blurry and shapeless where his glasses didn\u2019t reach. He loudly cleared his throat and scratched out another sentence on his transfiguration essay, hoping it wasn\u2019t complete nonsense.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe could have picked anyone! <i>Dean</i>\u00a0could have picked anyone! But they went with each other.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd just what is so wrong with Ginny, huh!?\u201d Harry shouted, finally losing it, as he dumped his essay and stood, turning to face Seamus. His hands curled into frustrated fists, both unsure of what he should actually be doing and why this bothered him so much.<br/></p><p>Seamus\u2019 face also grew red.\u00a0\u201cNothing,\u201d he muttered, shoving his book up to cover his face more.\u00a0\u201cJust don\u2019t understand why Dean would want to be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s spirited and honest and casts far better spells than you, Finnigan,\u201d Harry fired off, desperately trying to stop himself from listing all 100 adjectives that jumped to mind to describe Ginny.\u00a0\u201cBetter question is what does she see in Dean?\u201d<br/></p><p>Now Seamus sat up, dumping his book in his lap and staring boldly up at Harry.\u00a0\u201cAnd jus\u2019 what is wrong with Dean exactly?\u201d If possible, Seamus reddening face deepened even further in color.</p><p>Harry sat down in a huff, suddenly deflating. He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cDunno. Nothing, really. I guess.\u201d Dean had always been kind to Harry. It seemed rude to insult him just for dating his best mate\u2019s sister.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d<br/></p><p>The silence hung between them. Seamus picked his book back up and Harry his homework.</p><p>\u201cSo&hellip; It also bothers you that they\u2019re dating?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Harry slammed his homework back down, unreasonably grateful to be discussing this with someone.\u00a0\u201cIt just&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Seamus nodded.</p><p>Harry turned to sit on the couch so he was facing Seamus.</p><p>\u201cYou know what we should do?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>We</i>\u00a0should date. Make them feel as upset about this as we are about them.\u201d<br/></p><p>One of Harry\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise, but he stayed silent and mused over this proposal for a second. Seamus looked suddenly very awkward and embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u00a0\u2018twas a bad thought,\u201d he tried to brush off.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry interrupted. The proposal made an odd sort of sense to him. There was logic to this plan. The more he thought on it, the more he liked it. Harry smiled, getting a stab of joy at the thought of Ginny obsessing over him like he had been her, wondering why he would choose to go with Seamus. It made him feel unduly sadistic, though, and he tried to shake the feeling off.\u00a0\u201cWe should. We should do it.\u201d<br/></p><!-- more --><p>Now Seamus\u2019 eyebrows shot up.\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, right?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I mean&hellip;\u201d Seamus said carefully,\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019d be effectively coming out to the school. Even if you are straight, you\u2019d be telling everyone you weren\u2019t. And if you aren\u2019t straight&hellip; well, you\u2019d be telling them now, even if you aren\u2019t ready for that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo would you.\u201d<br/></p><p>Seamus blinked at him. Then laughed. Harry very calmly, very patiently, not at all frustratedly, waited for him to stop. When Seamus did did, he looked him straight in the eye and said,\u00a0\u201cHarry. I\u2019m gay, mate.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked owlishly.\u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d <i>Ohhhh</i>. Seamus looked at him expectantly. Finally, Harry shrugged.\u00a0\u201cWhatever. People already believe whatever rubbish the Prophet prints about me. Maybe I\u2019d rather they talk about me dating someone instead of how I killed Voldemort by feeding him babies or whatever it is they\u2019re claiming now.\u201d</p><p>Seamus grimaced, then burst out laughing again.\u00a0\u201cOkay. Follow my lead tomorrow, then.\u201d Before Harry could respond, Seamus yawned loudly and stretched, rubbing at his eyes.\u00a0\u201cBugger, I can\u2019t read this anymore. Coming to bed&hellip; <i>babe</i>?\u201d</p><p>Harry threw his cushion at Seamus.\u00a0\u201cDo not call me that in front of anyone else, ever.\u201d</p><p>Seamus laughed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll think of something better. Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d<br/></p><p>It was only after Seamus had been gone for ten minutes that Harry realized if he thought Seamus wanted to pretend to date him because he was gay and <i>had a crush on Dean - dammit, hadn\u2019t that been obvious and Harry had completely missed it</i>\u00a0- that Seamus probably thought Harry wanted to fake date Seamus because <i>he</i>\u00a0had a crush on Ginny. The thought bothered him all the up until he fell asleep.</p><p>.</p><p>When Harry woke up, Dean was already gone. Not surprising since he liked to get to the common room early to wait for Ginny and make sure they got to walk to breakfast together. Surprisingly, Neville (who often either overslept or seemed to have lost some bit of his outfit that he had to desperately look for) was also gone. Which left himself, Ron, and Seamus. The final of whom was casually sitting on his bed, his leg swinging lazily off it. Ron seemed to have made it up slightly before Harry and was staring at Seamus, seeming utterly bemused.\u00a0</p><p>Seamus gave Harry a moment to wake up and get his bearings before greeting him,\u00a0\u201cgood morning. Thought you\u2019d never get up. Thought I might have to go get breakfast to bring back to you.\u201d</p><p>Harry choked on his laughter, swinging his body out of bed.\u00a0\u201cHow rude of me,\u201d he finally managed.</p><p>Ron\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out of his skull.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShall we go, then? If you\u2019re still good with going together?\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry smiled, throwing on his cloak, socks, and shoes.\u00a0\u201cReady when you are.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t hold hands or anything, but they did walk out of the dorm side by side. When he didn\u2019t hear Ron behind him, Harry held up a hand to stop Seamus, ran back up the stairs, and poked his head into their dorm.\u00a0\u201cYou coming or what?\u201d</p><p>Ron slowly nodded and shuffled off his bed. Harry bounced back down to Seamus, who rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cWe really might miss breakfast, you know.\u201d</p><p>Entering the Great Hall, Harry braced himself for the stares and muttering. Very few people actually seemed to notice, though. When he and Seamus sat down, by Hermione rather than by Dean, who Seamus usually tried to sit next to and only ended up looking like an awkward third wheel when Ginny was around, they did gather some attention. Hermione looked between the two of them, took in a breath, then said,\u00a0\u201cwhere\u2019s Ron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d Harry said, dumping food onto his plate as Seamus did the same. Hermione studied them for another second, then shook her head, and went back to her book. Harry didn\u2019t recognize it, but he also didn\u2019t work hard at keeping up with Hermione\u2019s punishing reading pace.<br/></p><p>Breakfast was an odd affair. Hermione stuck to her book and Ron just kept throwing Harry sideways glances. For their part, Harry and Seamus were more quiet than usual. They didn\u2019t often hang out together, so conversation wasn\u2019t as natural as it would have been with just Ron and Hermione.</p><p>.</p><p>By the end of the day, people definitely knew. Alicia randomly gave him a high five. Fred and George had stopped by in the common room, pretended he wasn\u2019t actually\u00a0sitting with Seamus, and loudly asked him if he\u2019d like if they gave Seamus their older brother talk to threaten him into treating Harry right. Seamus had loudly protested that he was right there while Harry laughed uproariously. Justin Finch-Fletchley had nervously asked him if it had been a hard decision to be so out. Cho had smiled sadly at him, then run off, trying to hide her tears. But the biggest moment of all had been when Ron approached him where he and Seamus were working on their History of Magic paper together (which was going about as well as if he was working on it with Ron without Hermione) and asked to talk alone.</p><p>Seamus had raised his eyebrow, but Harry dumped his stuff, asked Seamus to watch it, and followed Ron up to their dorm. Neville was up there, but his curtains were drawn, and after a moment, Ron shrugged and turned to Harry. His voice was low and gruff. Harry wasn\u2019t sure what he expected, but it wasn\u2019t what next came out of Ron\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy - why did you tell me?\u201d He sounded both cross and upset.<br/></p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d<br/></p><p>Ron straightened, stomping his foot down.\u00a0\u201cAbout Seamus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! You were asleep.\u201d<br/></p><p>Ron went beet red.\u00a0\u201cNo, not <i>just</i>\u00a0Seamus. That you were&hellip; you know.\u201d</p><p>To that, Harry didn\u2019t have a good answer. He hadn\u2019t really thought about\u00a0\u201ccoming out\u201d like this. He\u2019d thought just being with Seamus would cover things.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve&hellip; I would\u2019ve been okay, you know.\u201d Suddenly Harry understood <i>why</i>\u00a0Ron was upset.\u00a0\u201cCharlie\u2019s aroace and Bill\u2019s bi and honestly, we all suspect Percy\u2019s gay, and well, you know Ginny&hellip; Well, Fred and George do anyway. They let it slip to me that she might be polysexual. She\u2019s at least questioning. You could have trusted me. You could have told me.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry hadn\u2019t known. Hadn\u2019t known any of that and somehow finding out about Ginny felt like an immense invasion of her privacy, especially since Harry didn\u2019t really know Charlie or Bill and didn\u2019t particularly get along with Percy. Suddenly knowing this about her made\u00a0Harry felt extremely guilty, even though it had been Ron to share. He sighed and looked over at Neville\u2019s bed.\u00a0\u201cNo, okay, look, I\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve told you, but there wasn\u2019t really a chance. And you can\u2019t tell anyone else, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s eyebrows knit together.\u00a0\u201cSure, Harry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d Harry\u2019s voice lowered, just in case Neville was listening,\u00a0\u201cwell, we\u2019re not really dating. I\u2019m helping him make Dean jealous.\u201d His face reddened slightly. He felt bad not telling Ron that he was also doing it to annoy Ginny, but&hellip; that was his secret. His and Seamus\u2019, he supposed.<br/></p><p>Ron crossed his arms and leaned back.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re doing it to help Seamus? And that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br/></p><p>He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI thought it would help distract people from the worse things that Umbridge and the Prophet are saying about me.\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s face softened - just a little.\u00a0\u201cI thought you - well&hellip; Never mind. Okay, just&hellip; be careful,\u201d Ron awkwardly ended. In that moment, he felt more like an older brother to Harry than like his best friend.</p><p>Harry shrugged and grinned.\u00a0\u201cNot really my thing,\u201d he joked.</p><p>Ron snorted but his eyes stayed hard. When he said nothing else, Harry sidestepped him and went to re-join Seamus.</p><p>.</p><p>Fake dating was nerve wracking the first day, waiting to see everyone\u2019s reactions to them being together. By the third day, it was actually kinda fun. With Cho, there\u2019d been so much pressure, not only with Cedric\u2019s death hanging between them but also because he felt like neither of them had known what they were supposed to do and had ended up kissing to hide that fact. With Seamus, it seemed like Seamus had a plan in mind and Harry could more sit back and follow his lead. And since they were only pretending to date, there wasn\u2019t really much pressure to preform any certain way. Mostly, they got to know each other better.</p><p>And by the end of the week, Dean and Ginny had definitely both noticed Harry and Seamus\u2019 blossoming relationship. Seamus and Harry would excitedly stay up or talk between classes, leaning together in familiarity and conspiratorially talking about finally seeing some of the reactions they had been looking for. When their dorm became tense with Dean only talking stiltedly to Seamus and not really to Harry at all and Ron\u2019s unsupportive silence, things seemed decidedly less fun. But Harry and Seamus couldn\u2019t stop now. They\u2019d only just gotten started.</p><p>By the middle of week two, though, Seamus was pushing Harry for them to take it further. They were hiding in an abandoned classroom on the fifth floor, out of earshot of the other Gryffindors and keeping their voices low as to not attract teachers - or Peeves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what people do when they date, Harry.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re not really dating.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut people think we are!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s just tell them to stay out of our business.\u201d<br/></p><p>Seamus frowned. Then he sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.\u00a0\u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ve gotta snog all over the place. I\u2019m as into PDA as you seem to be into kissing, but we if we keep the foot distance between us at all times, people are gonna figure out we\u2019re not really dating. And that defeats the purpose. So it\u2019s either break this thing off or get a little closer.\u201d</p><p>Harry thought for a moment. If he was being honest with himself, he wasn\u2019t really bothered with the idea of kissing Seamus. He at least seemed less likely to cry while they snogged than Cho was. And while he wasn\u2019t really Harry\u2019s type, it\u2019s not like he was ugly. And Harry had found he really enjoyed Seamus\u2019 sense of humor in the past two weeks of getting to know each other, although it still wasn\u2019t as fun as hanging with Ron. It was Ron that held him back. Actually, Ron\u2019s reaction. Ron didn\u2019t talk much to Harry these days and had taken to hanging with Hermione, Neville, or even Luna. Harry felt that being more publicly physical with Seamus would only widen the gap between them.</p><p>But at the same time, Ginny dating Dean was getting more and more under his skin when they didn\u2019t seem as upset as Harry felt.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said.\u00a0\u201cBut hugging and stuff like that. Dunno that I\u2019m really ready to try kissing you.<br/></p><p>Seamus brightened and punched him in the shoulder.\u00a0\u201cNo worries. Don\u2019t wanna kiss you either.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed, then covered his mouth. They ducked their head\u2019s out of the classroom to make sure the coast was clear before rushing to make it back to the common room before hours were up.</p><p>.</p><p>At first they mostly linked arms while they walked and bumped shoulders when they sat together during meals. Then Seamus gently tugged on Harry\u2019s arm to get him to lean into his chest when they sat together on the couch. And Harry was offering for Seamus to do the same. One day they shared a look and Harry gave the slightest of nods and Seamus kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>And Harry realized just how comfortable he\u2019d become resting his head on Seamus\u2019 shoulder and Seamus leaning back into his chest and in his arms. How relieved he was to have Seamus help shoulder his anger over Umbridge and his new wound, which would definitely scar. He\u2019d hid it from Hermione and saw Ron so little he didn\u2019t really need to hide it from him. Harry hadn\u2019t specifically shown it to Seamus, but nor had he tried hiding it, either.</p><p>Harry had thought it would be awkward and weird and forced with Seamus, but it felt very natural. Comfortable. It surprised Harry.</p><p>It surprised him more when he kissed Seamus. On the lips. For more than a couple seconds. Right on a couch in the common room, drowsy from the heat of the fire, knowing that Dean and Ginny were snogging in the corner - but also keenly aware of Ron glaring daggers into his back. He pulled back from Seamus suddenly, ashamed of his actions. Harry sunk down into the couch, letting it swallow him as Seamus\u2019 arm felt like lead around him.</p><p>Seamus didn\u2019t speak for a few moments. Finally, voice husky, he said,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s kind to ask before doing that.\u201d</p><p>Harry groaned and covered his face with his hands.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry.\u201d The words got stuck behind his hands, and he wasn\u2019t even sure Seamus could understand them.</p><p>Seamus\u2019 hand gave harry\u2019s shoulder a firm squeeze.\u00a0\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not half bad. You know, for not really having any experience.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowly lowered his hands.\u00a0\u201cWhy did that sound like a challenge?\u201d</p><p>Seamus merely laughed in response. His face was still warm, but Harry sat up, settling back next to Seamus.</p><p>.</p><p>Luna found him the next day as he was leaving the greenhouses after herbology. She stood in front of him as his classmates filed past him, hurrying to get out of the cold. She smiled warmly at him.\u00a0\u201cHi, Harry. Want to talk a minute?\u201d She\u2019d tried talking to him the other day after their DA meeting, but Neville had asked if she wanted to leave with him, and she\u2019d kindly agreed. Harry could have said he didn\u2019t really want to talk, but that was a lie, and he didn\u2019t seem able to lie to Luna. So he simply nodded, and they stepped back into the doorway of the greenhouse to soak up its warmth.</p><p>Luna studied him.\u00a0\u201cAre you doing okay with Seamus?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment washed over him and he nodded.\u00a0\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wonder if you know how you feel about him.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Harry said automatically, which he belatedly realized would still be true even if they were really dating.<br/></p><p>Luna smiled, soft and small, barely there, but there nonetheless.\u00a0\u201cHe cares very much for Dean,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs there anybody that doesn\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, plenty. I\u2019m just checking to see if you remember.\u201d<br/></p><p>Then one her fellow Ravenclaws came rushing in the door to the greenhouse, stomping the snow off his boots. He hurried into the blasting warmth. He paid no mind to Harry and Luna, yet the moment was still over. With a cockeyed look at him, Luna told him,\u00a0\u201cbetter hurry before you\u2019re late.\u201d Then she stepped all the way into the greenhouse, and Harry nearly had to run to avoid being late to his next class, the conversation with Luna weighing on his mind.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry was ready for Christmas break by the time it came. He felt like he might be losing himself in this game with Seamus. Or maybe it was the fact that he dreamed about Ginny almost every night, sometimes waking up in a cold sweat and looking over at Ron\u2019s bed as if Ron knew what was running through his head. Pretending to date Seamus was supposed to make Dean and Ginny jealous. It wasn\u2019t supposed to make Harry even more frustrated over their dating.</p><p>The break did him well, though, even though things were still strained and tense with Ron. His emotions and feelings felt more sorted out, but the best part was when he finally ran into Ginny and got to talk to her alone.</p><p>They sat in her room, the both of them on the floor, leaning up against her bed.</p><p>There were a hundred other things he wanted to say, but what came out was,\u00a0\u201cRon told me that you polysexual. Or questioning. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t ask, it just -\u201d</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes.\u00a0\u201cYeah, Fred kinda dragged it out of me. I knew as soon as I said it, they\u2019d probably tell everyone else except mum and dad. It sucks sometimes, but you learn pretty early on there\u2019s not a whole lot of secrets in a big family like this one.\u201d</p><p>A weight that Harry hadn\u2019t known he was carrying around slowly evaporated from his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo. You and Seamus. Is that you questioning, too?\u201d she asked, eyes darting around her floor as she picked at the hem of her cloak.<br/></p><p>Harry\u2019s breath hitched and he paused a moment, unsure of what to say. Finally, he admitted,\u00a0\u201cyeah.\u201d It was the first time he\u2019d admitted to himself that, while he didn\u2019t have those feelings for Seamus&hellip; he wasn\u2019t sure he couldn\u2019t have them for anybody else. Anybody else who wasn\u2019t a girl.</p><p>The smile she gave seemed sorrowful.\u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d she said slowly, carefully,\u00a0\u201cDean\u2019s pretty upset with you two.\u201d</p><p>Harry perked up, trying not to seem too inappropriately happy.\u00a0\u201cI kinda got that when he made a point of not talking to me in our dorm.\u201d</p><p>Ginny snorted.\u00a0\u201cYou should share your secret.\u201d She reddened deeply, going through at least five shades of red.\u00a0\u201cThat didn\u2019t come out right.\u201d She sighed.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t give me <i>any</i>\u00a0space. I know we\u2019re Ginny and Dean, but there\u2019s still a Ginny under here. You know?\u201d</p><p>Harry felt like he was walking on air as he nodded.</p><p>.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t really thought this out. Dean and Ginny had broken up a few days ago, but now Seamus and Harry were sort of stuck. It seemed to obvious to\u00a0\u2018break up\u2019 with each other so shortly after Dean and Ginny. But how long would they have to keep this up for it to seem natural?</p><p>As it turned out, they ended up continuing their relationship for the rest of the year. The long it went on, the more Seamus pined after Dean. Sometimes Harry took out a textbook to study it just to tune him out. Other times, it was like normal, where Seamus and Harry could just talk and be the good friends they had become, comfortable in each other\u2019s arms, both afraid of the approaching storm but not wanting to voice it. Dean was definitely jealous of them, though also still clearly pining after Ginny. He sat with Harry and Seamus at breakfast, now the third wheel instead of Seamus, his eyes following Ginny\u2019s every movement. He was finally talking to Harry but in a very jilted manner, and he often went up to bed early.</p><p>On one hand, the continuation of the relationship frustrated Harry. At this point, he fully realized and accepted that he was crushing very hard on Ginny. No more denying it for Ron\u2019s sake. He might finally have a chance with Ginny and was wasting it all away. On the other hand, time was ticking down. Harry wasn\u2019t sure what was coming in the next year - much less the next few months. The thought of being with Ginny and somehow having to be able to give her up if he had to&hellip; well, he didn\u2019t know if he would be strong enough to let her go in order to protect her. Even now, he wanted so badly to just hold her close and face the coming storm with her. Instead, he slipped his hand into Seamus\u2019 and comforted himself by insisting that Dean and Seamus would still have a chance and they would take it when the time was right. When Dean was ready to let go of Ginny and see who was right in front of him.</p><p>.</p><p>They broke up just a week before the end of school. There was no point in continuing this any longer. It was hard enough communicating with just Hermione and Ron over the summer, much less Seamus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe can always discuss this again start of next term,\u201d Harry had offered.<br/></p><p>Seamus just smiled.\u00a0\u201cI think I might be taken by then,\u201d he said, and Harry tried not to let his jealousy overcome his genuine happiness for him.\u00a0\u201cYou might be, too,\u201d Seamus said, elbowing his ribs in a friendly manner.</p><p>And because he didn\u2019t want to ruin it, Harry simply said,\u00a0\u201cyeah, sure. Anything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>He ran into Dean once when he went up to his dorm to grab an extra inkwell.</p><p>Expecting to still be receiving the semi-cold shoulder, he didn\u2019t bother with a greeting. Just started rooting around in his trunk instead. He nearly jumped when Dean spoke to him, the bitterness that had become typical absent from his voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I should be angry with you or just be relieved.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry pulled out of his trunk and looked back at the boy.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Dean sat down on the edge of Ron\u2019s bed, looking thoughtfully at Harry.\u00a0\u201cMad at you for both dating <i>and</i>\u00a0breaking up with my best mate, and relieved that it\u2019s over.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t know what to say. After a moment, Dean said,\u00a0\u201cI suppose you probably felt the same way about me dating Ginny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it even?\u201d<br/></p><p>Dean laughed, getting up to offer Harry a hand. Harry took it and shook it awkwardly.\u00a0\u201cDeal. Have a good summer, Harry.\u201d</p><p>It took the longest to patch things up with Ron, though. Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna had to sit through a half hour of them awkwardly\u00a0\u201cnot\u201d ignoring each other before Ginny finally stood. With her hand on her hip, she took on a distinctly Molly-like look.\u00a0\u201cOh, this is ridiculous. C\u2019mon. I\u2019m not sitting through this the rest of the ride back.\u201d Then she trounced out of the cabin. Luna gently grabbed Neville\u2019s elbow and led him out after Ginny.\u00a0</p><p>Hermione took a moment longer to gather all the stuff she had spread out and left, muttering\u00a0\u201cwell thank Merlin\u201d, leaving Ron and Harry alone.</p><p>It took fifteen minutes of awkward silence before Harry finally worked up the courage to tell his best friend,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d though he still wasn\u2019t quite sure what he was apologizing for.</p><p>Ron peered over at him from under a mat of red hair.\u00a0\u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you did it.\u201d Harry nodded, a lump in his throat. Ron nodded tersely.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that why we\u2019re fighting?\u201d he asked.<br/></p><p>Ron stared at him. Then, finally, he shrugged, sighed, and threw his arms up. He slumped back against his seat.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>And the ridiculousness of it all bubbled up in Harry and he laughed. And laughed and laughed and laughed. And Ron joined in.</p><p>Finally, when they could breathe again, Ron said,\u00a0\u201cat first I was upset because I thought you might be, you know, tossing Seamus around because he was clearly upset over Dean. But I guess I was more upset because I thought you liked Ginny and figured you were trying to hurt her or something.\u201d</p><p>A weight settled on Harry\u2019s chest. He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI guess I kind of was. I think I was mostly trying to cover up my own hurt, though. I definitely never wanted to hurt Ginny. I just&hellip; wanted her attention.\u201d It was weird to talk with Ron about Ginny, especially when he could see the minute clench of Ron\u2019s jaw, but it also felt good. Free. In this moment, it was if he and Ron had not just spent the past nine or so months not talking.</p><p>By the time Ginny, Luna, Neville, and Hermione returned to their cabin, Ron and Harry were set to laughing again and Harry had ordered a good fourth of the snacks off the trolley. Luna, Neville, Hermione, and Ginny brightened and entered the car, easily slipping into the conversation.</p><p>Sometime near the end of the ride, when Neville had drifted off, Hermione was furiously scribbling something, and Ron and Luna were playing the oddest game of chess Harry had ever watched, Ginny\u2019s hand brushed against his own. He felt sparks fly from his fingertips and a warmth settle in his belly. He gently intertwined his fingers with hers and determinedly looked out of the window and away from her. Even though they pulled away immediately as the train began jerking to a stop, the future felt full of possibilities.</p>",

Even if you are straight, you\u2019d be telling everyone you weren\u2019t. And if you aren\u2019t straight\u2026 well, you\u2019d be telling them now, even if you aren\u2019t ready for that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo would you.\u201d<br></p><p>Seamus blinked at him. Then laughed. Harry very calmly, very patiently, not at all frustratedly, waited for him to stop. When Seamus did did, he looked him straight in the eye and said,\u00a0\u201cHarry. I\u2019m gay, mate.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked owlishly.\u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d <i>Ohhhh</i>. Seamus looked at him expectantly. Finally, Harry shrugged.\u00a0\u201cWhatever. People already believe whatever rubbish the Prophet prints about me. Maybe I\u2019d rather they talk about me dating someone instead of how I killed Voldemort by feeding him babies or whatever it is they\u2019re claiming now.\u201d</p><p>Seamus grimaced, then burst out laughing again.\u00a0\u201cOkay. Follow my lead tomorrow, then.\u201d Before Harry could respond, Seamus yawned loudly and stretched, rubbing at his eyes.\u00a0\u201cBugger, I can\u2019t read this anymore. Coming to bed\u2026 <i>babe</i>?\u201d</p><p>Harry threw his cushion at Seamus.\u00a0\u201cDo not call me that in front of anyone else, ever.\u201d</p><p>Seamus laughed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll think of something better. Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d<br></p><p>It was only after Seamus had been gone for ten minutes that Harry realized if he thought Seamus wanted to pretend to date him because he was gay and <i>had a crush on Dean - dammit, hadn\u2019t that been obvious and Harry had completely missed it</i>\u00a0- that Seamus probably thought Harry wanted to fake date Seamus because <i>he</i>\u00a0had a crush on Ginny. The thought bothered him all the up until he fell asleep.</p><p>.</p><p>When Harry woke up, Dean was already gone. Not surprising since he liked to get to the common room early to wait for Ginny and make sure they got to walk to breakfast together. Surprisingly, Neville (who often either overslept or seemed to have lost some bit of his outfit that he had to desperately look for) was also gone. Which left himself, Ron, and Seamus. The final of whom was casually sitting on his bed, his leg swinging lazily off it. Ron seemed to have made it up slightly before Harry and was staring at Seamus, seeming utterly bemused.\u00a0</p><p>Seamus gave Harry a moment to wake up and get his bearings before greeting him,\u00a0\u201cgood morning. Thought you\u2019d never get up. Thought I might have to go get breakfast to bring back to you.\u201d</p><p>Harry choked on his laughter, swinging his body out of bed.\u00a0\u201cHow rude of me,\u201d he finally managed.</p><p>Ron\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out of his skull.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShall we go, then? If you\u2019re still good with going together?\u201d<br></p><p>Harry smiled, throwing on his cloak, socks, and shoes.\u00a0\u201cReady when you are.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t hold hands or anything, but they did walk out of the dorm side by side. When he didn\u2019t hear Ron behind him, Harry held up a hand to stop Seamus, ran back up the stairs, and poked his head into their dorm.\u00a0\u201cYou coming or what?\u201d</p><p>Ron slowly nodded and shuffled off his bed. Harry bounced back down to Seamus, who rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cWe really might miss breakfast, you know.\u201d</p><p>Entering the Great Hall, Harry braced himself for the stares and muttering. Very few people actually seemed to notice, though. When he and Seamus sat down, by Hermione rather than by Dean, who Seamus usually tried to sit next to and only ended up looking like an awkward third wheel when Ginny was around, they did gather some attention. Hermione looked between the two of them, took in a breath, then said,\u00a0\u201cwhere\u2019s Ron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d Harry said, dumping food onto his plate as Seamus did the same. Hermione studied them for another second, then shook her head, and went back to her book. Harry didn\u2019t recognize it, but he also didn\u2019t work hard at keeping up with Hermione\u2019s punishing reading pace.<br></p><p>Breakfast was an odd affair. Hermione stuck to her book and Ron just kept throwing Harry sideways glances. For their part, Harry and Seamus were more quiet than usual. They didn\u2019t often hang out together, so conversation wasn\u2019t as natural as it would have been with just Ron and Hermione.</p><p>.</p><p>By the end of the day, people definitely knew. Alicia randomly gave him a high five. Fred and George had stopped by in the common room, pretended he wasn\u2019t actually\u00a0sitting with Seamus, and loudly asked him if he\u2019d like if they gave Seamus their older brother talk to threaten him into treating Harry right. Seamus had loudly protested that he was right there while Harry laughed uproariously. Justin Finch-Fletchley had nervously asked him if it had been a hard decision to be so out. Cho had smiled sadly at him, then run off, trying to hide her tears. But the biggest moment of all had been when Ron approached him where he and Seamus were working on their History of Magic paper together (which was going about as well as if he was working on it with Ron without Hermione) and asked to talk alone.</p><p>Seamus had raised his eyebrow, but Harry dumped his stuff, asked Seamus to watch it, and followed Ron up to their dorm. Neville was up there, but his curtains were drawn, and after a moment, Ron shrugged and turned to Harry. His voice was low and gruff. Harry wasn\u2019t sure what he expected, but it wasn\u2019t what next came out of Ron\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy - why did you tell me?\u201d He sounded both cross and upset.<br></p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d<br></p><p>Ron straightened, stomping his foot down.\u00a0\u201cAbout Seamus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! You were asleep.\u201d<br></p><p>Ron went beet red.\u00a0\u201cNo, not <i>just</i>\u00a0Seamus. That you were\u2026 you know.\u201d</p><p>To that, Harry didn\u2019t have a good answer. He hadn\u2019t really thought about\u00a0\u201ccoming out\u201d like this. He\u2019d thought just being with Seamus would cover things.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve\u2026 I would\u2019ve been okay, you know.\u201d Suddenly Harry understood <i>why</i>\u00a0Ron was upset.\u00a0\u201cCharlie\u2019s aroace and Bill\u2019s bi and honestly, we all suspect Percy\u2019s gay, and well, you know Ginny\u2026 Well, Fred and George do anyway. They let it slip to me that she might be polysexual. She\u2019s at least questioning. You could have trusted me. You could have told me.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry hadn\u2019t known. Hadn\u2019t known any of that and somehow finding out about Ginny felt like an immense invasion of her privacy, especially since Harry didn\u2019t really know Charlie or Bill and didn\u2019t particularly get along with Percy. Suddenly knowing this about her made\u00a0Harry felt extremely guilty, even though it had been Ron to share. He sighed and looked over at Neville\u2019s bed.\u00a0\u201cNo, okay, look, I\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve told you, but there wasn\u2019t really a chance. And you can\u2019t tell anyone else, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s eyebrows knit together.\u00a0\u201cSure, Harry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d Harry\u2019s voice lowered, just in case Neville was listening,\u00a0\u201cwell, we\u2019re not really dating. I\u2019m helping him make Dean jealous.\u201d His face reddened slightly. He felt bad not telling Ron that he was also doing it to annoy Ginny, but\u2026 that was his secret. His and Seamus\u2019, he supposed.<br></p><p>Ron crossed his arms and leaned back.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re doing it to help Seamus? And that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br></p><p>He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI thought it would help distract people from the worse things that Umbridge and the Prophet are saying about me.\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s face softened - just a little.\u00a0\u201cI thought you - well\u2026 Never mind. Okay, just\u2026 be careful,\u201d Ron awkwardly ended. In that moment, he felt more like an older brother to Harry than like his best friend.</p><p>Harry shrugged and grinned.\u00a0\u201cNot really my thing,\u201d he joked.</p><p>Ron snorted but his eyes stayed hard. When he said nothing else, Harry sidestepped him and went to re-join Seamus.</p><p>.</p><p>Fake dating was nerve wracking the first day, waiting to see everyone\u2019s reactions to them being together. By the third day, it was actually kinda fun. With Cho, there\u2019d been so much pressure, not only with Cedric\u2019s death hanging between them but also because he felt like neither of them had known what they were supposed to do and had ended up kissing to hide that fact. With Seamus, it seemed like Seamus had a plan in mind and Harry could more sit back and follow his lead. And since they were only pretending to date, there wasn\u2019t really much pressure to preform any certain way. Mostly, they got to know each other better.</p><p>And by the end of the week, Dean and Ginny had definitely both noticed Harry and Seamus\u2019 blossoming relationship. Seamus and Harry would excitedly stay up or talk between classes, leaning together in familiarity and conspiratorially talking about finally seeing some of the reactions they had been looking for. When their dorm became tense with Dean only talking stiltedly to Seamus and not really to Harry at all and Ron\u2019s unsupportive silence, things seemed decidedly less fun. But Harry and Seamus couldn\u2019t stop now. They\u2019d only just gotten started.</p><p>By the middle of week two, though, Seamus was pushing Harry for them to take it further. They were hiding in an abandoned classroom on the fifth floor, out of earshot of the other Gryffindors and keeping their voices low as to not attract teachers - or Peeves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what people do when they date, Harry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re not really dating.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut people think we are!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s just tell them to stay out of our business.\u201d<br></p><p>Seamus frowned. Then he sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.\u00a0\u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ve gotta snog all over the place. I\u2019m as into PDA as you seem to be into kissing, but we if we keep the foot distance between us at all times, people are gonna figure out we\u2019re not really dating. And that defeats the purpose. So it\u2019s either break this thing off or get a little closer.\u201d</p><p>Harry thought for a moment. If he was being honest with himself, he wasn\u2019t really bothered with the idea of kissing Seamus. He at least seemed less likely to cry while they snogged than Cho was. And while he wasn\u2019t really Harry\u2019s type, it\u2019s not like he was ugly. And Harry had found he really enjoyed Seamus\u2019 sense of humor in the past two weeks of getting to know each other, although it still wasn\u2019t as fun as hanging with Ron. It was Ron that held him back. Actually, Ron\u2019s reaction. Ron didn\u2019t talk much to Harry these days and had taken to hanging with Hermione, Neville, or even Luna. Harry felt that being more publicly physical with Seamus would only widen the gap between them.</p><p>But at the same time, Ginny dating Dean was getting more and more under his skin when they didn\u2019t seem as upset as Harry felt.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said.\u00a0\u201cBut hugging and stuff like that. Dunno that I\u2019m really ready to try kissing you.<br></p><p>Seamus brightened and punched him in the shoulder.\u00a0\u201cNo worries. Don\u2019t wanna kiss you either.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed, then covered his mouth. They ducked their head\u2019s out of the classroom to make sure the coast was clear before rushing to make it back to the common room before hours were up.</p><p>.</p><p>At first they mostly linked arms while they walked and bumped shoulders when they sat together during meals. Then Seamus gently tugged on Harry\u2019s arm to get him to lean into his chest when they sat together on the couch. And Harry was offering for Seamus to do the same. One day they shared a look and Harry gave the slightest of nods and Seamus kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>And Harry realized just how comfortable he\u2019d become resting his head on Seamus\u2019 shoulder and Seamus leaning back into his chest and in his arms. How relieved he was to have Seamus help shoulder his anger over Umbridge and his new wound, which would definitely scar. He\u2019d hid it from Hermione and saw Ron so little he didn\u2019t really need to hide it from him. Harry hadn\u2019t specifically shown it to Seamus, but nor had he tried hiding it, either.</p><p>Harry had thought it would be awkward and weird and forced with Seamus, but it felt very natural. Comfortable. It surprised Harry.</p><p>It surprised him more when he kissed Seamus. On the lips. For more than a couple seconds. Right on a couch in the common room, drowsy from the heat of the fire, knowing that Dean and Ginny were snogging in the corner - but also keenly aware of Ron glaring daggers into his back. He pulled back from Seamus suddenly, ashamed of his actions. Harry sunk down into the couch, letting it swallow him as Seamus\u2019 arm felt like lead around him.</p><p>Seamus didn\u2019t speak for a few moments. Finally, voice husky, he said,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s kind to ask before doing that.\u201d</p><p>Harry groaned and covered his face with his hands.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry.\u201d The words got stuck behind his hands, and he wasn\u2019t even sure Seamus could understand them.</p><p>Seamus\u2019 hand gave harry\u2019s shoulder a firm squeeze.\u00a0\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not half bad. You know, for not really having any experience.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowly lowered his hands.\u00a0\u201cWhy did that sound like a challenge?\u201d</p><p>Seamus merely laughed in response. His face was still warm, but Harry sat up, settling back next to Seamus.</p><p>.</p><p>Luna found him the next day as he was leaving the greenhouses after herbology. She stood in front of him as his classmates filed past him, hurrying to get out of the cold. She smiled warmly at him.\u00a0\u201cHi, Harry. Want to talk a minute?\u201d She\u2019d tried talking to him the other day after their DA meeting, but Neville had asked if she wanted to leave with him, and she\u2019d kindly agreed. Harry could have said he didn\u2019t really want to talk, but that was a lie, and he didn\u2019t seem able to lie to Luna. So he simply nodded, and they stepped back into the doorway of the greenhouse to soak up its warmth.</p><p>Luna studied him.\u00a0\u201cAre you doing okay with Seamus?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment washed over him and he nodded.\u00a0\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wonder if you know how you feel about him.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Harry said automatically, which he belatedly realized would still be true even if they were really dating.<br></p><p>Luna smiled, soft and small, barely there, but there nonetheless.\u00a0\u201cHe cares very much for Dean,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs there anybody that doesn\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, plenty. I\u2019m just checking to see if you remember.\u201d<br></p><p>Then one her fellow Ravenclaws came rushing in the door to the greenhouse, stomping the snow off his boots. He hurried into the blasting warmth. He paid no mind to Harry and Luna, yet the moment was still over. With a cockeyed look at him, Luna told him,\u00a0\u201cbetter hurry before you\u2019re late.\u201d Then she stepped all the way into the greenhouse, and Harry nearly had to run to avoid being late to his next class, the conversation with Luna weighing on his mind.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry was ready for Christmas break by the time it came. He felt like he might be losing himself in this game with Seamus. Or maybe it was the fact that he dreamed about Ginny almost every night, sometimes waking up in a cold sweat and looking over at Ron\u2019s bed as if Ron knew what was running through his head. Pretending to date Seamus was supposed to make Dean and Ginny jealous. It wasn\u2019t supposed to make Harry even more frustrated over their dating.</p><p>The break did him well, though, even though things were still strained and tense with Ron. His emotions and feelings felt more sorted out, but the best part was when he finally ran into Ginny and got to talk to her alone.</p><p>They sat in her room, the both of them on the floor, leaning up against her bed.</p><p>There were a hundred other things he wanted to say, but what came out was,\u00a0\u201cRon told me that you polysexual. Or questioning. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t ask, it just -\u201d</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes.\u00a0\u201cYeah, Fred kinda dragged it out of me. I knew as soon as I said it, they\u2019d probably tell everyone else except mum and dad. It sucks sometimes, but you learn pretty early on there\u2019s not a whole lot of secrets in a big family like this one.\u201d</p><p>A weight that Harry hadn\u2019t known he was carrying around slowly evaporated from his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo. You and Seamus. Is that you questioning, too?\u201d she asked, eyes darting around her floor as she picked at the hem of her cloak.<br></p><p>Harry\u2019s breath hitched and he paused a moment, unsure of what to say. Finally, he admitted,\u00a0\u201cyeah.\u201d It was the first time he\u2019d admitted to himself that, while he didn\u2019t have those feelings for Seamus\u2026 he wasn\u2019t sure he couldn\u2019t have them for anybody else. Anybody else who wasn\u2019t a girl.</p><p>The smile she gave seemed sorrowful.\u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d she said slowly, carefully,\u00a0\u201cDean\u2019s pretty upset with you two.\u201d</p><p>Harry perked up, trying not to seem too inappropriately happy.\u00a0\u201cI kinda got that when he made a point of not talking to me in our dorm.\u201d</p><p>Ginny snorted.\u00a0\u201cYou should share your secret.\u201d She reddened deeply, going through at least five shades of red.\u00a0\u201cThat didn\u2019t come out right.\u201d She sighed.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t give me <i>any</i>\u00a0space. I know we\u2019re Ginny and Dean, but there\u2019s still a Ginny under here. You know?\u201d</p><p>Harry felt like he was walking on air as he nodded.</p><p>.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t really thought this out. Dean and Ginny had broken up a few days ago, but now Seamus and Harry were sort of stuck. It seemed to obvious to\u00a0\u2018break up\u2019 with each other so shortly after Dean and Ginny. But how long would they have to keep this up for it to seem natural?</p><p>As it turned out, they ended up continuing their relationship for the rest of the year. The long it went on, the more Seamus pined after Dean. Sometimes Harry took out a textbook to study it just to tune him out. Other times, it was like normal, where Seamus and Harry could just talk and be the good friends they had become, comfortable in each other\u2019s arms, both afraid of the approaching storm but not wanting to voice it. Dean was definitely jealous of them, though also still clearly pining after Ginny. He sat with Harry and Seamus at breakfast, now the third wheel instead of Seamus, his eyes following Ginny\u2019s every movement. He was finally talking to Harry but in a very jilted manner, and he often went up to bed early.</p><p>On one hand, the continuation of the relationship frustrated Harry. At this point, he fully realized and accepted that he was crushing very hard on Ginny. No more denying it for Ron\u2019s sake. He might finally have a chance with Ginny and was wasting it all away. On the other hand, time was ticking down. Harry wasn\u2019t sure what was coming in the next year - much less the next few months. The thought of being with Ginny and somehow having to be able to give her up if he had to\u2026 well, he didn\u2019t know if he would be strong enough to let her go in order to protect her. Even now, he wanted so badly to just hold her close and face the coming storm with her. Instead, he slipped his hand into Seamus\u2019 and comforted himself by insisting that Dean and Seamus would still have a chance and they would take it when the time was right. When Dean was ready to let go of Ginny and see who was right in front of him.</p><p>.</p><p>They broke up just a week before the end of school. There was no point in continuing this any longer. It was hard enough communicating with just Hermione and Ron over the summer, much less Seamus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe can always discuss this again start of next term,\u201d Harry had offered.<br></p><p>Seamus just smiled.\u00a0\u201cI think I might be taken by then,\u201d he said, and Harry tried not to let his jealousy overcome his genuine happiness for him.\u00a0\u201cYou might be, too,\u201d Seamus said, elbowing his ribs in a friendly manner.</p><p>And because he didn\u2019t want to ruin it, Harry simply said,\u00a0\u201cyeah, sure. Anything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>He ran into Dean once when he went up to his dorm to grab an extra inkwell.</p><p>Expecting to still be receiving the semi-cold shoulder, he didn\u2019t bother with a greeting. Just started rooting around in his trunk instead. He nearly jumped when Dean spoke to him, the bitterness that had become typical absent from his voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I should be angry with you or just be relieved.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry pulled out of his trunk and looked back at the boy.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Dean sat down on the edge of Ron\u2019s bed, looking thoughtfully at Harry.\u00a0\u201cMad at you for both dating <i>and</i>\u00a0breaking up with my best mate, and relieved that it\u2019s over.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t know what to say. After a moment, Dean said,\u00a0\u201cI suppose you probably felt the same way about me dating Ginny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it even?\u201d<br></p><p>Dean laughed, getting up to offer Harry a hand. Harry took it and shook it awkwardly.\u00a0\u201cDeal. Have a good summer, Harry.\u201d</p><p>It took the longest to patch things up with Ron, though. Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna had to sit through a half hour of them awkwardly\u00a0\u201cnot\u201d ignoring each other before Ginny finally stood. With her hand on her hip, she took on a distinctly Molly-like look.\u00a0\u201cOh, this is ridiculous. C\u2019mon. I\u2019m not sitting through this the rest of the ride back.\u201d Then she trounced out of the cabin. Luna gently grabbed Neville\u2019s elbow and led him out after Ginny.\u00a0</p><p>Hermione took a moment longer to gather all the stuff she had spread out and left, muttering\u00a0\u201cwell thank Merlin\u201d, leaving Ron and Harry alone.</p><p>It took fifteen minutes of awkward silence before Harry finally worked up the courage to tell his best friend,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d though he still wasn\u2019t quite sure what he was apologizing for.</p><p>Ron peered over at him from under a mat of red hair.\u00a0\u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you did it.\u201d Harry nodded, a lump in his throat. Ron nodded tersely.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that why we\u2019re fighting?\u201d he asked.<br></p><p>Ron stared at him. Then, finally, he shrugged, sighed, and threw his arms up. He slumped back against his seat.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>And the ridiculousness of it all bubbled up in Harry and he laughed. And laughed and laughed and laughed. And Ron joined in.</p><p>Finally, when they could breathe again, Ron said,\u00a0\u201cat first I was upset because I thought you might be, you know, tossing Seamus around because he was clearly upset over Dean. But I guess I was more upset because I thought you liked Ginny and figured you were trying to hurt her or something.\u201d</p><p>A weight settled on Harry\u2019s chest. He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI guess I kind of was. I think I was mostly trying to cover up my own hurt, though. I definitely never wanted to hurt Ginny. I just\u2026 wanted her attention.\u201d It was weird to talk with Ron about Ginny, especially when he could see the minute clench of Ron\u2019s jaw, but it also felt good. Free. In this moment, it was if he and Ron had not just spent the past nine or so months not talking.</p><p>By the time Ginny, Luna, Neville, and Hermione returned to their cabin, Ron and Harry were set to laughing again and Harry had ordered a good fourth of the snacks off the trolley. Luna, Neville, Hermione, and Ginny brightened and entered the car, easily slipping into the conversation.</p><p>Sometime near the end of the ride, when Neville had drifted off, Hermione was furiously scribbling something, and Ron and Luna were playing the oddest game of chess Harry had ever watched, Ginny\u2019s hand brushed against his own. He felt sparks fly from his fingertips and a warmth settle in his belly. He gently intertwined his fingers with hers and determinedly looked out of the window and away from her. Even though they pulled away immediately as the train began jerking to a stop, the future felt full of possibilities.</p>",

What makes her so interesting?\u201d<br></p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he glanced at Seamus from the corner of his vision, blurry and shapeless where his glasses didn\u2019t reach. He loudly cleared his throat and scratched out another sentence on his transfiguration essay, hoping it wasn\u2019t complete nonsense.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe could have picked anyone! <i>Dean</i>\u00a0could have picked anyone! But they went with each other.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd just what is so wrong with Ginny, huh!?\u201d Harry shouted, finally losing it, as he dumped his essay and stood, turning to face Seamus. His hands curled into frustrated fists, both unsure of what he should actually be doing and why this bothered him so much.<br></p><p>Seamus\u2019 face also grew red.\u00a0\u201cNothing,\u201d he muttered, shoving his book up to cover his face more.\u00a0\u201cJust don\u2019t understand why Dean would want to be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s spirited and honest and casts far better spells than you, Finnigan,\u201d Harry fired off, desperately trying to stop himself from listing all 100 adjectives that jumped to mind to describe Ginny.\u00a0\u201cBetter question is what does she see in Dean?\u201d<br></p><p>Now Seamus sat up, dumping his book in his lap and staring boldly up at Harry.\u00a0\u201cAnd jus\u2019 what is wrong with Dean exactly?\u201d If possible, Seamus reddening face deepened even further in color.</p><p>Harry sat down in a huff, suddenly deflating. He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cDunno. Nothing, really. I guess.\u201d Dean had always been kind to Harry. It seemed rude to insult him just for dating his best mate\u2019s sister.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d<br></p><p>The silence hung between them. Seamus picked his book back up and Harry his homework.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 It also bothers you that they\u2019re dating?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Harry slammed his homework back down, unreasonably grateful to be discussing this with someone.\u00a0\u201cIt just\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Seamus nodded.</p><p>Harry turned to sit on the couch so he was facing Seamus.</p><p>\u201cYou know what we should do?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>We</i>\u00a0should date. Make them feel as upset about this as we are about them.\u201d<br></p><p>One of Harry\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise, but he stayed silent and mused over this proposal for a second. Seamus looked suddenly very awkward and embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u00a0\u2018twas a bad thought,\u201d he tried to brush off.<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry interrupted. The proposal made an odd sort of sense to him. There was logic to this plan. The more he thought on it, the more he liked it. Harry smiled, getting a stab of joy at the thought of Ginny obsessing over him like he had been her, wondering why he would choose to go with Seamus. It made him feel unduly sadistic, though, and he tried to shake the feeling off.\u00a0\u201cWe should. We should do it.\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Now Seamus\u2019 eyebrows shot up.\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I mean\u2026\u201d Seamus said carefully,\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019d be effectively coming out to the school. Even if you are straight, you\u2019d be telling everyone you weren\u2019t. And if you aren\u2019t straight\u2026 well, you\u2019d be telling them now, even if you aren\u2019t ready for that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo would you.\u201d<br></p><p>Seamus blinked at him. Then laughed. Harry very calmly, very patiently, not at all frustratedly, waited for him to stop. When Seamus did did, he looked him straight in the eye and said,\u00a0\u201cHarry. I\u2019m gay, mate.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked owlishly.\u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d <i>Ohhhh</i>. Seamus looked at him expectantly. Finally, Harry shrugged.\u00a0\u201cWhatever. People already believe whatever rubbish the Prophet prints about me. Maybe I\u2019d rather they talk about me dating someone instead of how I killed Voldemort by feeding him babies or whatever it is they\u2019re claiming now.\u201d</p><p>Seamus grimaced, then burst out laughing again.\u00a0\u201cOkay. Follow my lead tomorrow, then.\u201d Before Harry could respond, Seamus yawned loudly and stretched, rubbing at his eyes.\u00a0\u201cBugger, I can\u2019t read this anymore. Coming to bed\u2026 <i>babe</i>?\u201d</p><p>Harry threw his cushion at Seamus.\u00a0\u201cDo not call me that in front of anyone else, ever.\u201d</p><p>Seamus laughed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll think of something better. Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d<br></p><p>It was only after Seamus had been gone for ten minutes that Harry realized if he thought Seamus wanted to pretend to date him because he was gay and <i>had a crush on Dean - dammit, hadn\u2019t that been obvious and Harry had completely missed it</i>\u00a0- that Seamus probably thought Harry wanted to fake date Seamus because <i>he</i>\u00a0had a crush on Ginny. The thought bothered him all the up until he fell asleep.</p><p>.</p><p>When Harry woke up, Dean was already gone. Not surprising since he liked to get to the common room early to wait for Ginny and make sure they got to walk to breakfast together. Surprisingly, Neville (who often either overslept or seemed to have lost some bit of his outfit that he had to desperately look for) was also gone. Which left himself, Ron, and Seamus. The final of whom was casually sitting on his bed, his leg swinging lazily off it. Ron seemed to have made it up slightly before Harry and was staring at Seamus, seeming utterly bemused.\u00a0</p><p>Seamus gave Harry a moment to wake up and get his bearings before greeting him,\u00a0\u201cgood morning. Thought you\u2019d never get up. Thought I might have to go get breakfast to bring back to you.\u201d</p><p>Harry choked on his laughter, swinging his body out of bed.\u00a0\u201cHow rude of me,\u201d he finally managed.</p><p>Ron\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out of his skull.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShall we go, then? If you\u2019re still good with going together?\u201d<br></p><p>Harry smiled, throwing on his cloak, socks, and shoes.\u00a0\u201cReady when you are.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t hold hands or anything, but they did walk out of the dorm side by side. When he didn\u2019t hear Ron behind him, Harry held up a hand to stop Seamus, ran back up the stairs, and poked his head into their dorm.\u00a0\u201cYou coming or what?\u201d</p><p>Ron slowly nodded and shuffled off his bed. Harry bounced back down to Seamus, who rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cWe really might miss breakfast, you know.\u201d</p><p>Entering the Great Hall, Harry braced himself for the stares and muttering. Very few people actually seemed to notice, though. When he and Seamus sat down, by Hermione rather than by Dean, who Seamus usually tried to sit next to and only ended up looking like an awkward third wheel when Ginny was around, they did gather some attention. Hermione looked between the two of them, took in a breath, then said,\u00a0\u201cwhere\u2019s Ron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d Harry said, dumping food onto his plate as Seamus did the same. Hermione studied them for another second, then shook her head, and went back to her book. Harry didn\u2019t recognize it, but he also didn\u2019t work hard at keeping up with Hermione\u2019s punishing reading pace.<br></p><p>Breakfast was an odd affair. Hermione stuck to her book and Ron just kept throwing Harry sideways glances. For their part, Harry and Seamus were more quiet than usual. They didn\u2019t often hang out together, so conversation wasn\u2019t as natural as it would have been with just Ron and Hermione.</p><p>.</p><p>By the end of the day, people definitely knew. Alicia randomly gave him a high five. Fred and George had stopped by in the common room, pretended he wasn\u2019t actually\u00a0sitting with Seamus, and loudly asked him if he\u2019d like if they gave Seamus their older brother talk to threaten him into treating Harry right. Seamus had loudly protested that he was right there while Harry laughed uproariously. Justin Finch-Fletchley had nervously asked him if it had been a hard decision to be so out. Cho had smiled sadly at him, then run off, trying to hide her tears. But the biggest moment of all had been when Ron approached him where he and Seamus were working on their History of Magic paper together (which was going about as well as if he was working on it with Ron without Hermione) and asked to talk alone.</p><p>Seamus had raised his eyebrow, but Harry dumped his stuff, asked Seamus to watch it, and followed Ron up to their dorm. Neville was up there, but his curtains were drawn, and after a moment, Ron shrugged and turned to Harry. His voice was low and gruff. Harry wasn\u2019t sure what he expected, but it wasn\u2019t what next came out of Ron\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy - why did you tell me?\u201d He sounded both cross and upset.<br></p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d<br></p><p>Ron straightened, stomping his foot down.\u00a0\u201cAbout Seamus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! You were asleep.\u201d<br></p><p>Ron went beet red.\u00a0\u201cNo, not <i>just</i>\u00a0Seamus. That you were\u2026 you know.\u201d</p><p>To that, Harry didn\u2019t have a good answer. He hadn\u2019t really thought about\u00a0\u201ccoming out\u201d like this. He\u2019d thought just being with Seamus would cover things.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve\u2026 I would\u2019ve been okay, you know.\u201d Suddenly Harry understood <i>why</i>\u00a0Ron was upset.\u00a0\u201cCharlie\u2019s aroace and Bill\u2019s bi and honestly, we all suspect Percy\u2019s gay, and well, you know Ginny\u2026 Well, Fred and George do anyway. They let it slip to me that she might be polysexual. She\u2019s at least questioning. You could have trusted me. You could have told me.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry hadn\u2019t known. Hadn\u2019t known any of that and somehow finding out about Ginny felt like an immense invasion of her privacy, especially since Harry didn\u2019t really know Charlie or Bill and didn\u2019t particularly get along with Percy. Suddenly knowing this about her made\u00a0Harry felt extremely guilty, even though it had been Ron to share. He sighed and looked over at Neville\u2019s bed.\u00a0\u201cNo, okay, look, I\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve told you, but there wasn\u2019t really a chance. And you can\u2019t tell anyone else, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s eyebrows knit together.\u00a0\u201cSure, Harry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d Harry\u2019s voice lowered, just in case Neville was listening,\u00a0\u201cwell, we\u2019re not really dating. I\u2019m helping him make Dean jealous.\u201d His face reddened slightly. He felt bad not telling Ron that he was also doing it to annoy Ginny, but\u2026 that was his secret. His and Seamus\u2019, he supposed.<br></p><p>Ron crossed his arms and leaned back.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re doing it to help Seamus? And that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br></p><p>He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI thought it would help distract people from the worse things that Umbridge and the Prophet are saying about me.\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s face softened - just a little.\u00a0\u201cI thought you - well\u2026 Never mind. Okay, just\u2026 be careful,\u201d Ron awkwardly ended. In that moment, he felt more like an older brother to Harry than like his best friend.</p><p>Harry shrugged and grinned.\u00a0\u201cNot really my thing,\u201d he joked.</p><p>Ron snorted but his eyes stayed hard. When he said nothing else, Harry sidestepped him and went to re-join Seamus.</p><p>.</p><p>Fake dating was nerve wracking the first day, waiting to see everyone\u2019s reactions to them being together. By the third day, it was actually kinda fun. With Cho, there\u2019d been so much pressure, not only with Cedric\u2019s death hanging between them but also because he felt like neither of them had known what they were supposed to do and had ended up kissing to hide that fact. With Seamus, it seemed like Seamus had a plan in mind and Harry could more sit back and follow his lead. And since they were only pretending to date, there wasn\u2019t really much pressure to preform any certain way. Mostly, they got to know each other better.</p><p>And by the end of the week, Dean and Ginny had definitely both noticed Harry and Seamus\u2019 blossoming relationship. Seamus and Harry would excitedly stay up or talk between classes, leaning together in familiarity and conspiratorially talking about finally seeing some of the reactions they had been looking for. When their dorm became tense with Dean only talking stiltedly to Seamus and not really to Harry at all and Ron\u2019s unsupportive silence, things seemed decidedly less fun. But Harry and Seamus couldn\u2019t stop now. They\u2019d only just gotten started.</p><p>By the middle of week two, though, Seamus was pushing Harry for them to take it further. They were hiding in an abandoned classroom on the fifth floor, out of earshot of the other Gryffindors and keeping their voices low as to not attract teachers - or Peeves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what people do when they date, Harry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re not really dating.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut people think we are!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s just tell them to stay out of our business.\u201d<br></p><p>Seamus frowned. Then he sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.\u00a0\u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ve gotta snog all over the place. I\u2019m as into PDA as you seem to be into kissing, but we if we keep the foot distance between us at all times, people are gonna figure out we\u2019re not really dating. And that defeats the purpose. So it\u2019s either break this thing off or get a little closer.\u201d</p><p>Harry thought for a moment. If he was being honest with himself, he wasn\u2019t really bothered with the idea of kissing Seamus. He at least seemed less likely to cry while they snogged than Cho was. And while he wasn\u2019t really Harry\u2019s type, it\u2019s not like he was ugly. And Harry had found he really enjoyed Seamus\u2019 sense of humor in the past two weeks of getting to know each other, although it still wasn\u2019t as fun as hanging with Ron. It was Ron that held him back. Actually, Ron\u2019s reaction. Ron didn\u2019t talk much to Harry these days and had taken to hanging with Hermione, Neville, or even Luna. Harry felt that being more publicly physical with Seamus would only widen the gap between them.</p><p>But at the same time, Ginny dating Dean was getting more and more under his skin when they didn\u2019t seem as upset as Harry felt.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said.\u00a0\u201cBut hugging and stuff like that. Dunno that I\u2019m really ready to try kissing you.<br></p><p>Seamus brightened and punched him in the shoulder.\u00a0\u201cNo worries. Don\u2019t wanna kiss you either.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed, then covered his mouth. They ducked their head\u2019s out of the classroom to make sure the coast was clear before rushing to make it back to the common room before hours were up.</p><p>.</p><p>At first they mostly linked arms while they walked and bumped shoulders when they sat together during meals. Then Seamus gently tugged on Harry\u2019s arm to get him to lean into his chest when they sat together on the couch. And Harry was offering for Seamus to do the same. One day they shared a look and Harry gave the slightest of nods and Seamus kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>And Harry realized just how comfortable he\u2019d become resting his head on Seamus\u2019 shoulder and Seamus leaning back into his chest and in his arms. How relieved he was to have Seamus help shoulder his anger over Umbridge and his new wound, which would definitely scar. He\u2019d hid it from Hermione and saw Ron so little he didn\u2019t really need to hide it from him. Harry hadn\u2019t specifically shown it to Seamus, but nor had he tried hiding it, either.</p><p>Harry had thought it would be awkward and weird and forced with Seamus, but it felt very natural. Comfortable. It surprised Harry.</p><p>It surprised him more when he kissed Seamus. On the lips. For more than a couple seconds. Right on a couch in the common room, drowsy from the heat of the fire, knowing that Dean and Ginny were snogging in the corner - but also keenly aware of Ron glaring daggers into his back. He pulled back from Seamus suddenly, ashamed of his actions. Harry sunk down into the couch, letting it swallow him as Seamus\u2019 arm felt like lead around him.</p><p>Seamus didn\u2019t speak for a few moments. Finally, voice husky, he said,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s kind to ask before doing that.\u201d</p><p>Harry groaned and covered his face with his hands.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry.\u201d The words got stuck behind his hands, and he wasn\u2019t even sure Seamus could understand them.</p><p>Seamus\u2019 hand gave harry\u2019s shoulder a firm squeeze.\u00a0\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not half bad. You know, for not really having any experience.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowly lowered his hands.\u00a0\u201cWhy did that sound like a challenge?\u201d</p><p>Seamus merely laughed in response. His face was still warm, but Harry sat up, settling back next to Seamus.</p><p>.</p><p>Luna found him the next day as he was leaving the greenhouses after herbology. She stood in front of him as his classmates filed past him, hurrying to get out of the cold. She smiled warmly at him.\u00a0\u201cHi, Harry. Want to talk a minute?\u201d She\u2019d tried talking to him the other day after their DA meeting, but Neville had asked if she wanted to leave with him, and she\u2019d kindly agreed. Harry could have said he didn\u2019t really want to talk, but that was a lie, and he didn\u2019t seem able to lie to Luna. So he simply nodded, and they stepped back into the doorway of the greenhouse to soak up its warmth.</p><p>Luna studied him.\u00a0\u201cAre you doing okay with Seamus?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment washed over him and he nodded.\u00a0\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wonder if you know how you feel about him.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Harry said automatically, which he belatedly realized would still be true even if they were really dating.<br></p><p>Luna smiled, soft and small, barely there, but there nonetheless.\u00a0\u201cHe cares very much for Dean,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs there anybody that doesn\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, plenty. I\u2019m just checking to see if you remember.\u201d<br></p><p>Then one her fellow Ravenclaws came rushing in the door to the greenhouse, stomping the snow off his boots. He hurried into the blasting warmth. He paid no mind to Harry and Luna, yet the moment was still over. With a cockeyed look at him, Luna told him,\u00a0\u201cbetter hurry before you\u2019re late.\u201d Then she stepped all the way into the greenhouse, and Harry nearly had to run to avoid being late to his next class, the conversation with Luna weighing on his mind.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry was ready for Christmas break by the time it came. He felt like he might be losing himself in this game with Seamus. Or maybe it was the fact that he dreamed about Ginny almost every night, sometimes waking up in a cold sweat and looking over at Ron\u2019s bed as if Ron knew what was running through his head. Pretending to date Seamus was supposed to make Dean and Ginny jealous. It wasn\u2019t supposed to make Harry even more frustrated over their dating.</p><p>The break did him well, though, even though things were still strained and tense with Ron. His emotions and feelings felt more sorted out, but the best part was when he finally ran into Ginny and got to talk to her alone.</p><p>They sat in her room, the both of them on the floor, leaning up against her bed.</p><p>There were a hundred other things he wanted to say, but what came out was,\u00a0\u201cRon told me that you polysexual. Or questioning. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t ask, it just -\u201d</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes.\u00a0\u201cYeah, Fred kinda dragged it out of me. I knew as soon as I said it, they\u2019d probably tell everyone else except mum and dad. It sucks sometimes, but you learn pretty early on there\u2019s not a whole lot of secrets in a big family like this one.\u201d</p><p>A weight that Harry hadn\u2019t known he was carrying around slowly evaporated from his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo. You and Seamus. Is that you questioning, too?\u201d she asked, eyes darting around her floor as she picked at the hem of her cloak.<br></p><p>Harry\u2019s breath hitched and he paused a moment, unsure of what to say. Finally, he admitted,\u00a0\u201cyeah.\u201d It was the first time he\u2019d admitted to himself that, while he didn\u2019t have those feelings for Seamus\u2026 he wasn\u2019t sure he couldn\u2019t have them for anybody else. Anybody else who wasn\u2019t a girl.</p><p>The smile she gave seemed sorrowful.\u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d she said slowly, carefully,\u00a0\u201cDean\u2019s pretty upset with you two.\u201d</p><p>Harry perked up, trying not to seem too inappropriately happy.\u00a0\u201cI kinda got that when he made a point of not talking to me in our dorm.\u201d</p><p>Ginny snorted.\u00a0\u201cYou should share your secret.\u201d She reddened deeply, going through at least five shades of red.\u00a0\u201cThat didn\u2019t come out right.\u201d She sighed.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t give me <i>any</i>\u00a0space. I know we\u2019re Ginny and Dean, but there\u2019s still a Ginny under here. You know?\u201d</p><p>Harry felt like he was walking on air as he nodded.</p><p>.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t really thought this out. Dean and Ginny had broken up a few days ago, but now Seamus and Harry were sort of stuck. It seemed to obvious to\u00a0\u2018break up\u2019 with each other so shortly after Dean and Ginny. But how long would they have to keep this up for it to seem natural?</p><p>As it turned out, they ended up continuing their relationship for the rest of the year. The long it went on, the more Seamus pined after Dean. Sometimes Harry took out a textbook to study it just to tune him out. Other times, it was like normal, where Seamus and Harry could just talk and be the good friends they had become, comfortable in each other\u2019s arms, both afraid of the approaching storm but not wanting to voice it. Dean was definitely jealous of them, though also still clearly pining after Ginny. He sat with Harry and Seamus at breakfast, now the third wheel instead of Seamus, his eyes following Ginny\u2019s every movement. He was finally talking to Harry but in a very jilted manner, and he often went up to bed early.</p><p>On one hand, the continuation of the relationship frustrated Harry. At this point, he fully realized and accepted that he was crushing very hard on Ginny. No more denying it for Ron\u2019s sake. He might finally have a chance with Ginny and was wasting it all away. On the other hand, time was ticking down. Harry wasn\u2019t sure what was coming in the next year - much less the next few months. The thought of being with Ginny and somehow having to be able to give her up if he had to\u2026 well, he didn\u2019t know if he would be strong enough to let her go in order to protect her. Even now, he wanted so badly to just hold her close and face the coming storm with her. Instead, he slipped his hand into Seamus\u2019 and comforted himself by insisting that Dean and Seamus would still have a chance and they would take it when the time was right. When Dean was ready to let go of Ginny and see who was right in front of him.</p><p>.</p><p>They broke up just a week before the end of school. There was no point in continuing this any longer. It was hard enough communicating with just Hermione and Ron over the summer, much less Seamus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe can always discuss this again start of next term,\u201d Harry had offered.<br></p><p>Seamus just smiled.\u00a0\u201cI think I might be taken by then,\u201d he said, and Harry tried not to let his jealousy overcome his genuine happiness for him.\u00a0\u201cYou might be, too,\u201d Seamus said, elbowing his ribs in a friendly manner.</p><p>And because he didn\u2019t want to ruin it, Harry simply said,\u00a0\u201cyeah, sure. Anything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>He ran into Dean once when he went up to his dorm to grab an extra inkwell.</p><p>Expecting to still be receiving the semi-cold shoulder, he didn\u2019t bother with a greeting. Just started rooting around in his trunk instead. He nearly jumped when Dean spoke to him, the bitterness that had become typical absent from his voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I should be angry with you or just be relieved.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry pulled out of his trunk and looked back at the boy.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Dean sat down on the edge of Ron\u2019s bed, looking thoughtfully at Harry.\u00a0\u201cMad at you for both dating <i>and</i>\u00a0breaking up with my best mate, and relieved that it\u2019s over.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t know what to say. After a moment, Dean said,\u00a0\u201cI suppose you probably felt the same way about me dating Ginny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it even?\u201d<br></p><p>Dean laughed, getting up to offer Harry a hand. Harry took it and shook it awkwardly.\u00a0\u201cDeal. Have a good summer, Harry.\u201d</p><p>It took the longest to patch things up with Ron, though. Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna had to sit through a half hour of them awkwardly\u00a0\u201cnot\u201d ignoring each other before Ginny finally stood. With her hand on her hip, she took on a distinctly Molly-like look.\u00a0\u201cOh, this is ridiculous. C\u2019mon. I\u2019m not sitting through this the rest of the ride back.\u201d Then she trounced out of the cabin. Luna gently grabbed Neville\u2019s elbow and led him out after Ginny.\u00a0</p><p>Hermione took a moment longer to gather all the stuff she had spread out and left, muttering\u00a0\u201cwell thank Merlin\u201d, leaving Ron and Harry alone.</p><p>It took fifteen minutes of awkward silence before Harry finally worked up the courage to tell his best friend,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d though he still wasn\u2019t quite sure what he was apologizing for.</p><p>Ron peered over at him from under a mat of red hair.\u00a0\u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you did it.\u201d Harry nodded, a lump in his throat. Ron nodded tersely.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that why we\u2019re fighting?\u201d he asked.<br></p><p>Ron stared at him. Then, finally, he shrugged, sighed, and threw his arms up. He slumped back against his seat.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>And the ridiculousness of it all bubbled up in Harry and he laughed. And laughed and laughed and laughed. And Ron joined in.</p><p>Finally, when they could breathe again, Ron said,\u00a0\u201cat first I was upset because I thought you might be, you know, tossing Seamus around because he was clearly upset over Dean. But I guess I was more upset because I thought you liked Ginny and figured you were trying to hurt her or something.\u201d</p><p>A weight settled on Harry\u2019s chest. He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI guess I kind of was. I think I was mostly trying to cover up my own hurt, though. I definitely never wanted to hurt Ginny. I just\u2026 wanted her attention.\u201d It was weird to talk with Ron about Ginny, especially when he could see the minute clench of Ron\u2019s jaw, but it also felt good. Free. In this moment, it was if he and Ron had not just spent the past nine or so months not talking.</p><p>By the time Ginny, Luna, Neville, and Hermione returned to their cabin, Ron and Harry were set to laughing again and Harry had ordered a good fourth of the snacks off the trolley. Luna, Neville, Hermione, and Ginny brightened and entered the car, easily slipping into the conversation.</p><p>Sometime near the end of the ride, when Neville had drifted off, Hermione was furiously scribbling something, and Ron and Luna were playing the oddest game of chess Harry had ever watched, Ginny\u2019s hand brushed against his own. He felt sparks fly from his fingertips and a warmth settle in his belly. He gently intertwined his fingers with hers and determinedly looked out of the window and away from her. Even though they pulled away immediately as the train began jerking to a stop, the future felt full of possibilities.</p>",

The art was so good, I had to write a corresponding story.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he see in her, anyway?&rdquo; Seamus muttered, angrily flipping through his potions book, uncaring that he was ripping several pages by doing so.<br /></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s ears pricked and his face reddened.</p><p>&ldquo;Redheaded, scarlet little witch. Like there aren&rsquo;t plenty of redheads around. What makes her so interesting?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, and he glanced at Seamus from the corner of his vision, blurry and shapeless where his glasses didn&rsquo;t reach. He loudly cleared his throat and scratched out another sentence on his transfiguration essay, hoping it wasn&rsquo;t complete nonsense.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She could have picked anyone! <i>Dean</i>&nbsp;could have picked anyone! But they went with each other.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And just what is so wrong with Ginny, huh!?&rdquo; Harry shouted, finally losing it, as he dumped his essay and stood, turning to face Seamus. His hands curled into frustrated fists, both unsure of what he should actually be doing and why this bothered him so much.<br /></p><p>Seamus&rsquo; face also grew red.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he muttered, shoving his book up to cover his face more.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t understand why Dean would want to be with her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s spirited and honest and casts far better spells than you, Finnigan,&rdquo; Harry fired off, desperately trying to stop himself from listing all 100 adjectives that jumped to mind to describe Ginny.&nbsp;&ldquo;Better question is what does she see in Dean?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Now Seamus sat up, dumping his book in his lap and staring boldly up at Harry.&nbsp;&ldquo;And jus&rsquo; what is wrong with Dean exactly?&rdquo; If possible, Seamus reddening face deepened even further in color.</p><p>Harry sat down in a huff, suddenly deflating. He shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Dunno. Nothing, really. I guess.&rdquo; Dean had always been kind to Harry. It seemed rude to insult him just for dating his best mate&rsquo;s sister.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The silence hung between them. Seamus picked his book back up and Harry his homework.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; It also bothers you that they&rsquo;re dating?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Harry slammed his homework back down, unreasonably grateful to be discussing this with someone.&nbsp;&ldquo;It just&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Seamus nodded.</p><p>Harry turned to sit on the couch so he was facing Seamus.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what we should do?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>We</i>&nbsp;should date. Make them feel as upset about this as we are about them.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>One of Harry&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up in surprise, but he stayed silent and mused over this proposal for a second. Seamus looked suddenly very awkward and embarrassed.</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind,&nbsp;&lsquo;twas a bad thought,&rdquo; he tried to brush off.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Harry interrupted. The proposal made an odd sort of sense to him. There was logic to this plan. The more he thought on it, the more he liked it. Harry smiled, getting a stab of joy at the thought of Ginny obsessing over him like he had been her, wondering why he would choose to go with Seamus. It made him feel unduly sadistic, though, and he tried to shake the feeling off.&nbsp;&ldquo;We should. We should do it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Now Seamus&rsquo; eyebrows shot up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not, right?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, I mean&hellip;&rdquo; Seamus said carefully,&nbsp;&ldquo;you&rsquo;d be effectively coming out to the school. Even if you are straight, you&rsquo;d be telling everyone you weren&rsquo;t. And if you aren&rsquo;t straight&hellip; well, you&rsquo;d be telling them now, even if you aren&rsquo;t ready for that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So would you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Seamus blinked at him. Then laughed. Harry very calmly, very patiently, not at all frustratedly, waited for him to stop. When Seamus did did, he looked him straight in the eye and said,&nbsp;&ldquo;Harry. I&rsquo;m gay, mate.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry blinked owlishly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; <i>Ohhhh</i>. Seamus looked at him expectantly. Finally, Harry shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever. People already believe whatever rubbish the Prophet prints about me. Maybe I&rsquo;d rather they talk about me dating someone instead of how I killed Voldemort by feeding him babies or whatever it is they&rsquo;re claiming now.&rdquo;</p><p>Seamus grimaced, then burst out laughing again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. Follow my lead tomorrow, then.&rdquo; Before Harry could respond, Seamus yawned loudly and stretched, rubbing at his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bugger, I can&rsquo;t read this anymore. Coming to bed&hellip; <i>babe</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry threw his cushion at Seamus.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do not call me that in front of anyone else, ever.&rdquo;</p><p>Seamus laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of something better. Night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>It was only after Seamus had been gone for ten minutes that Harry realized if he thought Seamus wanted to pretend to date him because he was gay and <i>had a crush on Dean - dammit, hadn&rsquo;t that been obvious and Harry had completely missed it</i>&nbsp;- that Seamus probably thought Harry wanted to fake date Seamus because <i>he</i>&nbsp;had a crush on Ginny. The thought bothered him all the up until he fell asleep.</p><p>.</p><p>When Harry woke up, Dean was already gone. Not surprising since he liked to get to the common room early to wait for Ginny and make sure they got to walk to breakfast together. Surprisingly, Neville (who often either overslept or seemed to have lost some bit of his outfit that he had to desperately look for) was also gone. Which left himself, Ron, and Seamus. The final of whom was casually sitting on his bed, his leg swinging lazily off it. Ron seemed to have made it up slightly before Harry and was staring at Seamus, seeming utterly bemused.&nbsp;</p><p>Seamus gave Harry a moment to wake up and get his bearings before greeting him,&nbsp;&ldquo;good morning. Thought you&rsquo;d never get up. Thought I might have to go get breakfast to bring back to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry choked on his laughter, swinging his body out of bed.&nbsp;&ldquo;How rude of me,&rdquo; he finally managed.</p><p>Ron&rsquo;s eyes nearly bugged out of his skull.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we go, then? If you&rsquo;re still good with going together?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry smiled, throwing on his cloak, socks, and shoes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ready when you are.&rdquo;</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t hold hands or anything, but they did walk out of the dorm side by side. When he didn&rsquo;t hear Ron behind him, Harry held up a hand to stop Seamus, ran back up the stairs, and poked his head into their dorm.&nbsp;&ldquo;You coming or what?&rdquo;</p><p>Ron slowly nodded and shuffled off his bed. Harry bounced back down to Seamus, who rolled his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;We really might miss breakfast, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>Entering the Great Hall, Harry braced himself for the stares and muttering. Very few people actually seemed to notice, though. When he and Seamus sat down, by Hermione rather than by Dean, who Seamus usually tried to sit next to and only ended up looking like an awkward third wheel when Ginny was around, they did gather some attention. Hermione looked between the two of them, took in a breath, then said,&nbsp;&ldquo;where&rsquo;s Ron?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; Harry said, dumping food onto his plate as Seamus did the same. Hermione studied them for another second, then shook her head, and went back to her book. Harry didn&rsquo;t recognize it, but he also didn&rsquo;t work hard at keeping up with Hermione&rsquo;s punishing reading pace.<br /></p><p>Breakfast was an odd affair. Hermione stuck to her book and Ron just kept throwing Harry sideways glances. For their part, Harry and Seamus were more quiet than usual. They didn&rsquo;t often hang out together, so conversation wasn&rsquo;t as natural as it would have been with just Ron and Hermione.</p><p>.</p><p>By the end of the day, people definitely knew. Alicia randomly gave him a high five. Fred and George had stopped by in the common room, pretended he wasn&rsquo;t actually&nbsp;sitting with Seamus, and loudly asked him if he&rsquo;d like if they gave Seamus their older brother talk to threaten him into treating Harry right. Seamus had loudly protested that he was right there while Harry laughed uproariously. Justin Finch-Fletchley had nervously asked him if it had been a hard decision to be so out. Cho had smiled sadly at him, then run off, trying to hide her tears. But the biggest moment of all had been when Ron approached him where he and Seamus were working on their History of Magic paper together (which was going about as well as if he was working on it with Ron without Hermione) and asked to talk alone.</p><p>Seamus had raised his eyebrow, but Harry dumped his stuff, asked Seamus to watch it, and followed Ron up to their dorm. Neville was up there, but his curtains were drawn, and after a moment, Ron shrugged and turned to Harry. His voice was low and gruff. Harry wasn&rsquo;t sure what he expected, but it wasn&rsquo;t what next came out of Ron&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Why - why did you tell me?&rdquo; He sounded both cross and upset.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell you what?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ron straightened, stomping his foot down.&nbsp;&ldquo;About Seamus!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! You were asleep.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ron went beet red.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, not <i>just</i>&nbsp;Seamus. That you were&hellip; you know.&rdquo;</p><p>To that, Harry didn&rsquo;t have a good answer. He hadn&rsquo;t really thought about&nbsp;&ldquo;coming out&rdquo; like this. He&rsquo;d thought just being with Seamus would cover things.</p><p>&ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve&hellip; I would&rsquo;ve been okay, you know.&rdquo; Suddenly Harry understood <i>why</i>&nbsp;Ron was upset.&nbsp;&ldquo;Charlie&rsquo;s aroace and Bill&rsquo;s bi and honestly, we all suspect Percy&rsquo;s gay, and well, you know Ginny&hellip; Well, Fred and George do anyway. They let it slip to me that she might be polysexual. She&rsquo;s at least questioning. You could have trusted me. You could have told me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry hadn&rsquo;t known. Hadn&rsquo;t known any of that and somehow finding out about Ginny felt like an immense invasion of her privacy, especially since Harry didn&rsquo;t really know Charlie or Bill and didn&rsquo;t particularly get along with Percy. Suddenly knowing this about her made&nbsp;Harry felt extremely guilty, even though it had been Ron to share. He sighed and looked over at Neville&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, okay, look, I&rsquo;m sorry. I should&rsquo;ve told you, but there wasn&rsquo;t really a chance. And you can&rsquo;t tell anyone else, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Ron&rsquo;s eyebrows knit together.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, Harry. What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice lowered, just in case Neville was listening,&nbsp;&ldquo;well, we&rsquo;re not really dating. I&rsquo;m helping him make Dean jealous.&rdquo; His face reddened slightly. He felt bad not telling Ron that he was also doing it to annoy Ginny, but&hellip; that was his secret. His and Seamus&rsquo;, he supposed.<br /></p><p>Ron crossed his arms and leaned back.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it to help Seamus? And that&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought it would help distract people from the worse things that Umbridge and the Prophet are saying about me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron&rsquo;s face softened - just a little.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought you - well&hellip; Never mind. Okay, just&hellip; be careful,&rdquo; Ron awkwardly ended. In that moment, he felt more like an older brother to Harry than like his best friend.</p><p>Harry shrugged and grinned.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really my thing,&rdquo; he joked.</p><p>Ron snorted but his eyes stayed hard. When he said nothing else, Harry sidestepped him and went to re-join Seamus.</p><p>.</p><p>Fake dating was nerve wracking the first day, waiting to see everyone&rsquo;s reactions to them being together. By the third day, it was actually kinda fun. With Cho, there&rsquo;d been so much pressure, not only with Cedric&rsquo;s death hanging between them but also because he felt like neither of them had known what they were supposed to do and had ended up kissing to hide that fact. With Seamus, it seemed like Seamus had a plan in mind and Harry could more sit back and follow his lead. And since they were only pretending to date, there wasn&rsquo;t really much pressure to preform any certain way. Mostly, they got to know each other better.</p><p>And by the end of the week, Dean and Ginny had definitely both noticed Harry and Seamus&rsquo; blossoming relationship. Seamus and Harry would excitedly stay up or talk between classes, leaning together in familiarity and conspiratorially talking about finally seeing some of the reactions they had been looking for. When their dorm became tense with Dean only talking stiltedly to Seamus and not really to Harry at all and Ron&rsquo;s unsupportive silence, things seemed decidedly less fun. But Harry and Seamus couldn&rsquo;t stop now. They&rsquo;d only just gotten started.</p><p>By the middle of week two, though, Seamus was pushing Harry for them to take it further. They were hiding in an abandoned classroom on the fifth floor, out of earshot of the other Gryffindors and keeping their voices low as to not attract teachers - or Peeves.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what people do when they date, Harry.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but we&rsquo;re not really dating.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But people think we are!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s just tell them to stay out of our business.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Seamus frowned. Then he sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;ve gotta snog all over the place. I&rsquo;m as into PDA as you seem to be into kissing, but we if we keep the foot distance between us at all times, people are gonna figure out we&rsquo;re not really dating. And that defeats the purpose. So it&rsquo;s either break this thing off or get a little closer.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry thought for a moment. If he was being honest with himself, he wasn&rsquo;t really bothered with the idea of kissing Seamus. He at least seemed less likely to cry while they snogged than Cho was. And while he wasn&rsquo;t really Harry&rsquo;s type, it&rsquo;s not like he was ugly. And Harry had found he really enjoyed Seamus&rsquo; sense of humor in the past two weeks of getting to know each other, although it still wasn&rsquo;t as fun as hanging with Ron. It was Ron that held him back. Actually, Ron&rsquo;s reaction. Ron didn&rsquo;t talk much to Harry these days and had taken to hanging with Hermione, Neville, or even Luna. Harry felt that being more publicly physical with Seamus would only widen the gap between them.</p><p>But at the same time, Ginny dating Dean was getting more and more under his skin when they didn&rsquo;t seem as upset as Harry felt.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he finally said.&nbsp;&ldquo;But hugging and stuff like that. Dunno that I&rsquo;m really ready to try kissing you.<br /></p><p>Seamus brightened and punched him in the shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;No worries. Don&rsquo;t wanna kiss you either.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry laughed, then covered his mouth. They ducked their head&rsquo;s out of the classroom to make sure the coast was clear before rushing to make it back to the common room before hours were up.</p><p>.</p><p>At first they mostly linked arms while they walked and bumped shoulders when they sat together during meals. Then Seamus gently tugged on Harry&rsquo;s arm to get him to lean into his chest when they sat together on the couch. And Harry was offering for Seamus to do the same. One day they shared a look and Harry gave the slightest of nods and Seamus kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>And Harry realized just how comfortable he&rsquo;d become resting his head on Seamus&rsquo; shoulder and Seamus leaning back into his chest and in his arms. How relieved he was to have Seamus help shoulder his anger over Umbridge and his new wound, which would definitely scar. He&rsquo;d hid it from Hermione and saw Ron so little he didn&rsquo;t really need to hide it from him. Harry hadn&rsquo;t specifically shown it to Seamus, but nor had he tried hiding it, either.</p><p>Harry had thought it would be awkward and weird and forced with Seamus, but it felt very natural. Comfortable. It surprised Harry.</p><p>It surprised him more when he kissed Seamus. On the lips. For more than a couple seconds. Right on a couch in the common room, drowsy from the heat of the fire, knowing that Dean and Ginny were snogging in the corner - but also keenly aware of Ron glaring daggers into his back. He pulled back from Seamus suddenly, ashamed of his actions. Harry sunk down into the couch, letting it swallow him as Seamus&rsquo; arm felt like lead around him.</p><p>Seamus didn&rsquo;t speak for a few moments. Finally, voice husky, he said,&nbsp;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s kind to ask before doing that.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry groaned and covered his face with his hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. So sorry.&rdquo; The words got stuck behind his hands, and he wasn&rsquo;t even sure Seamus could understand them.</p><p>Seamus&rsquo; hand gave harry&rsquo;s shoulder a firm squeeze.&nbsp;&ldquo;S&rsquo;okay,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not half bad. You know, for not really having any experience.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry slowly lowered his hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why did that sound like a challenge?&rdquo;</p><p>Seamus merely laughed in response. His face was still warm, but Harry sat up, settling back next to Seamus.</p><p>.</p><p>Luna found him the next day as he was leaving the greenhouses after herbology. She stood in front of him as his classmates filed past him, hurrying to get out of the cold. She smiled warmly at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, Harry. Want to talk a minute?&rdquo; She&rsquo;d tried talking to him the other day after their DA meeting, but Neville had asked if she wanted to leave with him, and she&rsquo;d kindly agreed. Harry could have said he didn&rsquo;t really want to talk, but that was a lie, and he didn&rsquo;t seem able to lie to Luna. So he simply nodded, and they stepped back into the doorway of the greenhouse to soak up its warmth.</p><p>Luna studied him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you doing okay with Seamus?&rdquo;</p><p>Embarrassment washed over him and he nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just wonder if you know how you feel about him.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend,&rdquo; Harry said automatically, which he belatedly realized would still be true even if they were really dating.<br /></p><p>Luna smiled, soft and small, barely there, but there nonetheless.&nbsp;&ldquo;He cares very much for Dean,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anybody that doesn&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, plenty. I&rsquo;m just checking to see if you remember.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Then one her fellow Ravenclaws came rushing in the door to the greenhouse, stomping the snow off his boots. He hurried into the blasting warmth. He paid no mind to Harry and Luna, yet the moment was still over. With a cockeyed look at him, Luna told him,&nbsp;&ldquo;better hurry before you&rsquo;re late.&rdquo; Then she stepped all the way into the greenhouse, and Harry nearly had to run to avoid being late to his next class, the conversation with Luna weighing on his mind.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry was ready for Christmas break by the time it came. He felt like he might be losing himself in this game with Seamus. Or maybe it was the fact that he dreamed about Ginny almost every night, sometimes waking up in a cold sweat and looking over at Ron&rsquo;s bed as if Ron knew what was running through his head. Pretending to date Seamus was supposed to make Dean and Ginny jealous. It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to make Harry even more frustrated over their dating.</p><p>The break did him well, though, even though things were still strained and tense with Ron. His emotions and feelings felt more sorted out, but the best part was when he finally ran into Ginny and got to talk to her alone.</p><p>They sat in her room, the both of them on the floor, leaning up against her bed.</p><p>There were a hundred other things he wanted to say, but what came out was,&nbsp;&ldquo;Ron told me that you polysexual. Or questioning. I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t ask, it just -&rdquo;</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, Fred kinda dragged it out of me. I knew as soon as I said it, they&rsquo;d probably tell everyone else except mum and dad. It sucks sometimes, but you learn pretty early on there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of secrets in a big family like this one.&rdquo;</p><p>A weight that Harry hadn&rsquo;t known he was carrying around slowly evaporated from his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;So. You and Seamus. Is that you questioning, too?&rdquo; she asked, eyes darting around her floor as she picked at the hem of her cloak.<br /></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s breath hitched and he paused a moment, unsure of what to say. Finally, he admitted,&nbsp;&ldquo;yeah.&rdquo; It was the first time he&rsquo;d admitted to himself that, while he didn&rsquo;t have those feelings for Seamus&hellip; he wasn&rsquo;t sure he couldn&rsquo;t have them for anybody else. Anybody else who wasn&rsquo;t a girl.</p><p>The smile she gave seemed sorrowful.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said slowly, carefully,&nbsp;&ldquo;Dean&rsquo;s pretty upset with you two.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry perked up, trying not to seem too inappropriately happy.&nbsp;&ldquo;I kinda got that when he made a point of not talking to me in our dorm.&rdquo;</p><p>Ginny snorted.&nbsp;&ldquo;You should share your secret.&rdquo; She reddened deeply, going through at least five shades of red.&nbsp;&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t come out right.&rdquo; She sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that he doesn&rsquo;t give me <i>any</i>&nbsp;space. I know we&rsquo;re Ginny and Dean, but there&rsquo;s still a Ginny under here. You know?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry felt like he was walking on air as he nodded.</p><p>.</p><p>They hadn&rsquo;t really thought this out. Dean and Ginny had broken up a few days ago, but now Seamus and Harry were sort of stuck. It seemed to obvious to&nbsp;&lsquo;break up&rsquo; with each other so shortly after Dean and Ginny. But how long would they have to keep this up for it to seem natural?</p><p>As it turned out, they ended up continuing their relationship for the rest of the year. The long it went on, the more Seamus pined after Dean. Sometimes Harry took out a textbook to study it just to tune him out. Other times, it was like normal, where Seamus and Harry could just talk and be the good friends they had become, comfortable in each other&rsquo;s arms, both afraid of the approaching storm but not wanting to voice it. Dean was definitely jealous of them, though also still clearly pining after Ginny. He sat with Harry and Seamus at breakfast, now the third wheel instead of Seamus, his eyes following Ginny&rsquo;s every movement. He was finally talking to Harry but in a very jilted manner, and he often went up to bed early.</p><p>On one hand, the continuation of the relationship frustrated Harry. At this point, he fully realized and accepted that he was crushing very hard on Ginny. No more denying it for Ron&rsquo;s sake. He might finally have a chance with Ginny and was wasting it all away. On the other hand, time was ticking down. Harry wasn&rsquo;t sure what was coming in the next year - much less the next few months. The thought of being with Ginny and somehow having to be able to give her up if he had to&hellip; well, he didn&rsquo;t know if he would be strong enough to let her go in order to protect her. Even now, he wanted so badly to just hold her close and face the coming storm with her. Instead, he slipped his hand into Seamus&rsquo; and comforted himself by insisting that Dean and Seamus would still have a chance and they would take it when the time was right. When Dean was ready to let go of Ginny and see who was right in front of him.</p><p>.</p><p>They broke up just a week before the end of school. There was no point in continuing this any longer. It was hard enough communicating with just Hermione and Ron over the summer, much less Seamus.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We can always discuss this again start of next term,&rdquo; Harry had offered.<br /></p><p>Seamus just smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I might be taken by then,&rdquo; he said, and Harry tried not to let his jealousy overcome his genuine happiness for him.&nbsp;&ldquo;You might be, too,&rdquo; Seamus said, elbowing his ribs in a friendly manner.</p><p>And because he didn&rsquo;t want to ruin it, Harry simply said,&nbsp;&ldquo;yeah, sure. Anything&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p><p>He ran into Dean once when he went up to his dorm to grab an extra inkwell.</p><p>Expecting to still be receiving the semi-cold shoulder, he didn&rsquo;t bother with a greeting. Just started rooting around in his trunk instead. He nearly jumped when Dean spoke to him, the bitterness that had become typical absent from his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I should be angry with you or just be relieved.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry pulled out of his trunk and looked back at the boy.&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Dean sat down on the edge of Ron&rsquo;s bed, looking thoughtfully at Harry.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mad at you for both dating <i>and</i>&nbsp;breaking up with my best mate, and relieved that it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; Harry didn&rsquo;t know what to say. After a moment, Dean said,&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose you probably felt the same way about me dating Ginny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Call it even?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dean laughed, getting up to offer Harry a hand. Harry took it and shook it awkwardly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Deal. Have a good summer, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>It took the longest to patch things up with Ron, though. Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna had to sit through a half hour of them awkwardly&nbsp;&ldquo;not&rdquo; ignoring each other before Ginny finally stood. With her hand on her hip, she took on a distinctly Molly-like look.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, this is ridiculous. C&rsquo;mon. I&rsquo;m not sitting through this the rest of the ride back.&rdquo; Then she trounced out of the cabin. Luna gently grabbed Neville&rsquo;s elbow and led him out after Ginny.&nbsp;</p><p>Hermione took a moment longer to gather all the stuff she had spread out and left, muttering&nbsp;&ldquo;well thank Merlin&rdquo;, leaving Ron and Harry alone.</p><p>It took fifteen minutes of awkward silence before Harry finally worked up the courage to tell his best friend,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; though he still wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what he was apologizing for.</p><p>Ron peered over at him from under a mat of red hair.&nbsp;&ldquo;You like her, don&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s why you did it.&rdquo; Harry nodded, a lump in his throat. Ron nodded tersely.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that why we&rsquo;re fighting?&rdquo; he asked.<br /></p><p>Ron stared at him. Then, finally, he shrugged, sighed, and threw his arms up. He slumped back against his seat.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he admitted.</p><p>And the ridiculousness of it all bubbled up in Harry and he laughed. And laughed and laughed and laughed. And Ron joined in.</p><p>Finally, when they could breathe again, Ron said,&nbsp;&ldquo;at first I was upset because I thought you might be, you know, tossing Seamus around because he was clearly upset over Dean. But I guess I was more upset because I thought you liked Ginny and figured you were trying to hurt her or something.&rdquo;</p><p>A weight settled on Harry&rsquo;s chest. He sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess I kind of was. I think I was mostly trying to cover up my own hurt, though. I definitely never wanted to hurt Ginny. I just&hellip; wanted her attention.&rdquo; It was weird to talk with Ron about Ginny, especially when he could see the minute clench of Ron&rsquo;s jaw, but it also felt good. Free. In this moment, it was if he and Ron had not just spent the past nine or so months not talking.</p><p>By the time Ginny, Luna, Neville, and Hermione returned to their cabin, Ron and Harry were set to laughing again and Harry had ordered a good fourth of the snacks off the trolley. Luna, Neville, Hermione, and Ginny brightened and entered the car, easily slipping into the conversation.</p><p>Sometime near the end of the ride, when Neville had drifted off, Hermione was furiously scribbling something, and Ron and Luna were playing the oddest game of chess Harry had ever watched, Ginny&rsquo;s hand brushed against his own. He felt sparks fly from his fingertips and a warmth settle in his belly. He gently intertwined his fingers with hers and determinedly looked out of the window and away from her. Even though they pulled away immediately as the train began jerking to a stop, the future felt full of possibilities.</p>",

The art was so good, I had to write a corresponding story.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he see in her, anyway?&rdquo; Seamus muttered, angrily flipping through his potions book, uncaring that he was ripping several pages by doing so.<br /></p>\n<p>Harry&rsquo;s ears pricked and his face reddened.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Redheaded, scarlet little witch. Like there aren&rsquo;t plenty of redheads around. What makes her so interesting?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, and he glanced at Seamus from the corner of his vision, blurry and shapeless where his glasses didn&rsquo;t reach. He loudly cleared his throat and scratched out another sentence on his transfiguration essay, hoping it wasn&rsquo;t complete nonsense.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She could have picked anyone! <i>Dean</i>&nbsp;could have picked anyone! But they went with each other.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;And just what is so wrong with Ginny, huh!?&rdquo; Harry shouted, finally losing it, as he dumped his essay and stood, turning to face Seamus. His hands curled into frustrated fists, both unsure of what he should actually be doing and why this bothered him so much.<br /></p>\n<p>Seamus&rsquo; face also grew red.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he muttered, shoving his book up to cover his face more.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t understand why Dean would want to be with her.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s spirited and honest and casts far better spells than you, Finnigan,&rdquo; Harry fired off, desperately trying to stop himself from listing all 100 adjectives that jumped to mind to describe Ginny.&nbsp;&ldquo;Better question is what does she see in Dean?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>Now Seamus sat up, dumping his book in his lap and staring boldly up at Harry.&nbsp;&ldquo;And jus&rsquo; what is wrong with Dean exactly?&rdquo; If possible, Seamus reddening face deepened even further in color.</p>\n<p>Harry sat down in a huff, suddenly deflating. He shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Dunno. Nothing, really. I guess.&rdquo; Dean had always been kind to Harry. It seemed rude to insult him just for dating his best mate&rsquo;s sister.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>The silence hung between them. Seamus picked his book back up and Harry his homework.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So&hellip; It also bothers you that they&rsquo;re dating?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Harry slammed his homework back down, unreasonably grateful to be discussing this with someone.&nbsp;&ldquo;It just&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>Seamus nodded.</p>\n<p>Harry turned to sit on the couch so he was facing Seamus.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know what we should do?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i>&nbsp;should date. Make them feel as upset about this as we are about them.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>One of Harry&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up in surprise, but he stayed silent and mused over this proposal for a second. Seamus looked suddenly very awkward and embarrassed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&nbsp;&lsquo;twas a bad thought,&rdquo; he tried to brush off.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Harry interrupted. The proposal made an odd sort of sense to him. There was logic to this plan. The more he thought on it, the more he liked it. Harry smiled, getting a stab of joy at the thought of Ginny obsessing over him like he had been her, wondering why he would choose to go with Seamus. It made him feel unduly sadistic, though, and he tried to shake the feeling off.&nbsp;&ldquo;We should. We should do it.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n</p>",
