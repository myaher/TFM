Hope you like it! </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Bex groaned as she went to rearrange the makeup brushes on the stand, the afternoon being slower than the rest of the day. Bowie was busy at the Red Rooster, so he couldn&rsquo;t get her a smoothie, and Cece was at home, still upset about the wedding. Bex sighed as she thought back to the explosion at the restaurant, and the eerie silence that had persisted since that day. Of course she got Cece&rsquo;s anger, but it was getting a bit out of hand now. </p><p>As she was deep in thought about the wedding and Miranda&rsquo;s words of warning, the bell at the door chimed, indicating someone&rsquo;s arrival. Bex hastily plastered on a smile before turning around. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, welcome to Cloud 10. How may I,&rdquo; She started, before realising that it didn&rsquo;t look like it was a customer. A boy with dirty blonde hair, wearing a Jefferson Middle School letterman hoodie was stood at the dooreay, pulling at the hoodie. She narrowed her eyes as she walked over to him, arms folded. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is Andi here?&rdquo; He asked, looking up at her. </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s asking?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;TJ. Kippen. From school?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh. The TJ Kippen. The boy who Buffy had problems with last year. Because he was being mean and rude. And the boy who left Cyrus hanging on Costume Day and is the reason Cyrus hasn&rsquo;t been himself lately. That TJ Kippen, </i>Bex thought to herself. Or so she thought. TJ&rsquo;s face fell even more, and her eyes went wide. </p><p>&ldquo;Did I say that out loud?&rdquo; She mumbled, and the boy just nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Look, I know you hate me. Everyone does, as they should,&rdquo; TJ said sadly, looking down at his shoes. &ldquo;But I just need to tell Andi something about my sister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why your sister? Can&rsquo;t she come herself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She sent me here, I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; TJ said, shrugging his shoulders. Just then, the door chimed open, and Bex turned to see who it was now. </p><p>&ldquo;Amber? What are you doing here?&rdquo; TJ asked, raising his eyebrows. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait. You two know each other?&rdquo; Bex asked, pointing at the two of them. Amber scoffed. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s my brother,&rdquo; She said, jabbing her thumb in his direction, TJ nodding. Bex looked between the two and shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;Huh. Makes sense,&rdquo; She said nonchalantly, going back to rearranging the brushes. </p><p>The two siblings just looked at each other awkwardly as Bex continued to rearrange brushes. Finally, she huffed and looked up, placing a hand on her hips. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you two here for a reason?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I was here to give Andi this note from Amber with this bag,&rdquo; TJ said, pulling it out of his backpack. &ldquo;Although, she probably wouldn&rsquo;t wanna see me right now. But Amber made me go for some reason,&rdquo; He said, staring pointedly at her. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; He asked Amber. </p><p>&ldquo;I came to find you,&rdquo; She said, grabbing his elbow and continuing in a low voice, still audible to Bex. &ldquo;Kira called me, asking why you haven&rsquo;t texted her back.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex looked curiously at TJ, trying to place that extremely familiar name. TJ just sighed, pulling out his phone. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; He whispered, as he looked at all the texts. Just then, it also clicked for Bex who Kira was. <i>Costume girl. </i></p><p>&ldquo;She also told me to remind you about something,&rdquo; Amber continued, glancing sideways at Bex hesitantly. &ldquo;You know what.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded, his shoulders drooping even more. </p><p>Bex was so confused. &ldquo;Hold on a minute. Isn&rsquo;t Kira the girl you bailed on Cyrus to do the costume with?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked up at her, confused. &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>Bex shrugged. &ldquo;I have a daughter who tells me everything. Plus I got a soft spot for Cyrus, and he was in here the other day. So he told me.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked down when she mentioned Cyrus, an action that confused her. &ldquo;Anyway, if she&rsquo;s worth ditching your friend over, why don&rsquo;t you wanna text her back? Is that how you treat your friends?&rdquo; Bex asked pointedly. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not my friend!&rdquo; TJ said loudly, before rubbing his arms. Amber held his shoulder, trying to get him to calm down. </p><p>Bex furrowed her eyebrows. &ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;she&rsquo;s not your friend&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ tried to say something, but couldn&rsquo;t get anything out. Amber spoke up instead. &ldquo;Look, I know you heard Cyrus&rsquo; side of the story, which is valid. But there&rsquo;s a lot they don&rsquo;t know either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly. All I know is it involved a salt shaker, white shirts and betrayal,&rdquo; Bex said, walking towards the two. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; She said softly, TJ looking up at her nervously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for snapping a bit. I just really care about Cyrus. So I look out for him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; TJ said quietly. &ldquo;I care about Cyrus too. It&rsquo;s just, Costume Day was a mess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna talk about it?&rdquo; Bex said, sitting on the arm of the chair. </p><p>TJ took a deep breath and looked at Bex. &ldquo;I was all set to do the costume with Cyrus, but then the day before, Kira came up to me. And she said something,&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;Something that made me really insecure, because I wasn&rsquo;t ready for it to be known. So, i took the coward&rsquo;s way out and have been hanging out with her since. Sorry I can&rsquo;t tell you what it was,&rdquo; TJ said, looking down. &ldquo;I, I&rsquo;m just not&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; Bex said with a comforting smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. You do need to talk to him though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dont know,&rdquo; TJ said, looking down. &ldquo;He hates me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t hate you,&rdquo; Amber said. &ldquo;Like Andi said, he&rsquo;s just disappointed.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ just looked away, and Bex patted him on the shoulder. She took the bag from him and turned to Amber. &ldquo;Okay, and this goes to Andi from you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber lunged forward, grabbing for the bag. &ldquo;A-Actually, I decided not to give it. It&rsquo;s stupid,&rdquo; She fumbled. And behind her, TJ groaned. </p><p>&ldquo;Amber, seriously? You&rsquo;re gonna chicken out again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chicken out of what?&rdquo; Bex asked, holding the bag away from Amber, who was desperately trying to reach for it. </p><p>Amber stopped jumping, and looked at Bex. She took a deep breath and squeezed her eyes shut, saying, &ldquo;Out of telling Andi I like her.&rdquo;</p><p>It took a minute for the realisation to dawn on Bex. &ldquo;Ohhhh,&rdquo; She whispered, looking at Amber. She smiled comfortingly at her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Amber. Andi won&rsquo;t hate you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hopefully,&rdquo; She mumbled, looking up at Bex nervously. &ldquo;Do you hate me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pssht, no!&rdquo; Bex said, waving her hand dismissively. &ldquo;How could I hate you when I have my fair share of ex-girlfriends?&rdquo; She said, placing the bag on the table. When she turned back, the two siblings were staring at her, gobsmacked. </p><p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; The two of them said, sending Bex giggling. She got up from the arm of the chair, looking at the two. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, is there anything else I can do for you two?&rdquo; She said with a smile, the two shaking their heads and making their way to the door. Before leaving, Amber turned back. </p><p>&ldquo;Just, tell me how she reacts, please?&rdquo; Amber said, and Bex gave her a thumbs up. </p><p>But TJ didn&rsquo;t leave. He pulled Amber to him, whispering something to her, before walking back towards Bex. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened TJ?&rdquo; Bex asked, noticing the way he was pulling at his hoodie. </p><p>TJ kept his gaze focused down as he spoke. &ldquo;The thing Kira said to me, when she wanted me to do the costume with her, was would I rather do a costume with Cyrus than with her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Bex asked, confused. She leaned back against the counter, looking at TJ. Finally, he looked up at her, his eyes shifty. </p><p>&ldquo;The way she asked it, was like she was asking me would I rather do it with a boy than a girl. Like, like she knew I was,&rdquo; He said quietly, his voice choking up. Bex understood immediately what had happened, and pulled TJ in for a hug. He was stiff at first, but then he hugged her back, her shirt getting slightly wet with tears. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you did it with her, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She asked softly after she pulled away. &ldquo;Because she found out and you got scared she&rsquo;d tell someone.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ just nodded, wiping away the years that had formed. </p><p>Bex pulled him to her by the shoulder. &ldquo;That was not good, what she did. You aren&rsquo;t a coward TJ. And if you tell Cyrus this, he&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if he hates me even more?&rdquo; </p><p>Bex shook her head. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t. I know Cyrus. He&rsquo;d get it.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sniffed, looking up at Bex. &ldquo;You know how she found out, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; Bex said, thinking back to all the times Cyrus had spoken about TJ, and the one time TJ had come by with him for something. She had noticed the looks, the touches, the laughs. But she hadnt thought much of it. <i>Young love. </i></p><p>&ldquo;How am I supposed to tell him that if he asks?&rdquo; TJ asked. </p><p>Bex just smiled, walking him to the door. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded, some of the weaught gone from his walk. &ldquo;Thanks, Bex. And I&rsquo;m sorry for bothering you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; She said with a smile. &ldquo;You and your sister aren&rsquo;t that bad, TJ Kippen,&rdquo; She said, before closing the door. </p><p>What an eventful day. Hopefully, everything would work out just fine. </p><p>(And it did, as Bex would see at the party in Andi&rsquo;s house, with Cyrus and TJ laughing and holding hands, not hiding their feelings. And with Amber and Andi smiling and whispering to each other. Bowie walked up to her and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; And she just smiled, holding onto his waist, looking down at her wedding ring. </p><p>Everything worked out great.)</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p><i>This is so bad I kadjdjdjsj I&rsquo;m so sorry</i></p><p><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\"><b>Send me prompts and I&rsquo;ll do them!</b></a><b> </b></p>",

Hope you like it! </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Bex groaned as she went to rearrange the makeup brushes on the stand, the afternoon being slower than the rest of the day. Bowie was busy at the Red Rooster, so he couldn\u2019t get her a smoothie, and Cece was at home, still upset about the wedding. Bex sighed as she thought back to the explosion at the restaurant, and the eerie silence that had persisted since that day. Of course she got Cece\u2019s anger, but it was getting a bit out of hand now. </p><p>As she was deep in thought about the wedding and Miranda\u2019s words of warning, the bell at the door chimed, indicating someone\u2019s arrival. Bex hastily plastered on a smile before turning around. </p><p>\u201cHi, welcome to Cloud 10. How may I,\u201d She started, before realising that it didn\u2019t look like it was a customer. A boy with dirty blonde hair, wearing a Jefferson Middle School letterman hoodie was stood at the dooreay, pulling at the hoodie. She narrowed her eyes as she walked over to him, arms folded. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Andi here?\u201d He asked, looking up at her. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTJ. Kippen. From school?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh. The TJ Kippen. The boy who Buffy had problems with last year. Because he was being mean and rude. And the boy who left Cyrus hanging on Costume Day and is the reason Cyrus hasn\u2019t been himself lately. That TJ Kippen, </i>Bex thought to herself. Or so she thought. TJ\u2019s face fell even more, and her eyes went wide. </p><p>\u201cDid I say that out loud?\u201d She mumbled, and the boy just nodded. </p><p>\u201cLook, I know you hate me. Everyone does, as they should,\u201d TJ said sadly, looking down at his shoes. \u201cBut I just need to tell Andi something about my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy your sister? Can\u2019t she come herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent me here, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d TJ said, shrugging his shoulders. Just then, the door chimed open, and Bex turned to see who it was now. </p><p>\u201cAmber? What are you doing here?\u201d TJ asked, raising his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cWait. You two know each other?\u201d Bex asked, pointing at the two of them. Amber scoffed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my brother,\u201d She said, jabbing her thumb in his direction, TJ nodding. Bex looked between the two and shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cHuh. Makes sense,\u201d She said nonchalantly, going back to rearranging the brushes. </p><p>The two siblings just looked at each other awkwardly as Bex continued to rearrange brushes. Finally, she huffed and looked up, placing a hand on her hips. </p><p>\u201cAre you two here for a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was here to give Andi this note from Amber with this bag,\u201d TJ said, pulling it out of his backpack. \u201cAlthough, she probably wouldn\u2019t wanna see me right now. But Amber made me go for some reason,\u201d He said, staring pointedly at her. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d He asked Amber. </p><p>\u201cI came to find you,\u201d She said, grabbing his elbow and continuing in a low voice, still audible to Bex. \u201cKira called me, asking why you haven\u2019t texted her back.\u201d</p><p>Bex looked curiously at TJ, trying to place that extremely familiar name.

She narrowed her eyes as she walked over to him, arms folded. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Andi here?\u201d He asked, looking up at her. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTJ. Kippen. From school?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh. The TJ Kippen. The boy who Buffy had problems with last year. Because he was being mean and rude. And the boy who left Cyrus hanging on Costume Day and is the reason Cyrus hasn\u2019t been himself lately. That TJ Kippen, </i>Bex thought to herself. Or so she thought. TJ\u2019s face fell even more, and her eyes went wide. </p><p>\u201cDid I say that out loud?\u201d She mumbled, and the boy just nodded. </p><p>\u201cLook, I know you hate me. Everyone does, as they should,\u201d TJ said sadly, looking down at his shoes. \u201cBut I just need to tell Andi something about my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy your sister? Can\u2019t she come herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent me here, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d TJ said, shrugging his shoulders. Just then, the door chimed open, and Bex turned to see who it was now. </p><p>\u201cAmber? What are you doing here?\u201d TJ asked, raising his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cWait. You two know each other?\u201d Bex asked, pointing at the two of them. Amber scoffed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my brother,\u201d She said, jabbing her thumb in his direction, TJ nodding. Bex looked between the two and shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cHuh. Makes sense,\u201d She said nonchalantly, going back to rearranging the brushes. </p><p>The two siblings just looked at each other awkwardly as Bex continued to rearrange brushes. Finally, she huffed and looked up, placing a hand on her hips. </p><p>\u201cAre you two here for a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was here to give Andi this note from Amber with this bag,\u201d TJ said, pulling it out of his backpack. \u201cAlthough, she probably wouldn\u2019t wanna see me right now. But Amber made me go for some reason,\u201d He said, staring pointedly at her. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d He asked Amber. </p><p>\u201cI came to find you,\u201d She said, grabbing his elbow and continuing in a low voice, still audible to Bex. \u201cKira called me, asking why you haven\u2019t texted her back.\u201d</p><p>Bex looked curiously at TJ, trying to place that extremely familiar name. TJ just sighed, pulling out his phone. \u201cFuck,\u201d He whispered, as he looked at all the texts. Just then, it also clicked for Bex who Kira was. <i>Costume girl. </i></p><p>\u201cShe also told me to remind you about something,\u201d Amber continued, glancing sideways at Bex hesitantly. \u201cYou know what.\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, his shoulders drooping even more. </p><p>Bex was so confused. \u201cHold on a minute. Isn\u2019t Kira the girl you bailed on Cyrus to do the costume with?\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up at her, confused. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Bex shrugged. \u201cI have a daughter who tells me everything. Plus I got a soft spot for Cyrus, and he was in here the other day. So he told me.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked down when she mentioned Cyrus, an action that confused her. \u201cAnyway, if she\u2019s worth ditching your friend over, why don\u2019t you wanna text her back? Is that how you treat your friends?\u201d Bex asked pointedly. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my friend!\u201d TJ said loudly, before rubbing his arms. Amber held his shoulder, trying to get him to calm down. </p><p>Bex furrowed her eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018she\u2019s not your friend\u2019?\u201d</p><p>TJ tried to say something, but couldn\u2019t get anything out. Amber spoke up instead. \u201cLook, I know you heard Cyrus\u2019 side of the story, which is valid. But there\u2019s a lot they don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly. All I know is it involved a salt shaker, white shirts and betrayal,\u201d Bex said, walking towards the two. \u201cHey,\u201d She said softly, TJ looking up at her nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for snapping a bit. I just really care about Cyrus. So I look out for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s okay,\u201d TJ said quietly. \u201cI care about Cyrus too. It\u2019s just, Costume Day was a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna talk about it?\u201d Bex said, sitting on the arm of the chair. </p><p>TJ took a deep breath and looked at Bex. \u201cI was all set to do the costume with Cyrus, but then the day before, Kira came up to me. And she said something,\u201d He hesitated. \u201cSomething that made me really insecure, because I wasn\u2019t ready for it to be known. So, i took the coward\u2019s way out and have been hanging out with her since. Sorry I can\u2019t tell you what it was,\u201d TJ said, looking down. \u201cI, I\u2019m just not\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Bex said with a comforting smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You do need to talk to him though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dont know,\u201d TJ said, looking down. \u201cHe hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d Amber said. \u201cLike Andi said, he\u2019s just disappointed.\u201d</p><p>TJ just looked away, and Bex patted him on the shoulder. She took the bag from him and turned to Amber. \u201cOkay, and this goes to Andi from you, right?\u201d</p><p>Amber lunged forward, grabbing for the bag. \u201cA-Actually, I decided not to give it. It\u2019s stupid,\u201d She fumbled. And behind her, TJ groaned. </p><p>\u201cAmber, seriously? You\u2019re gonna chicken out again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken out of what?\u201d Bex asked, holding the bag away from Amber, who was desperately trying to reach for it. </p><p>Amber stopped jumping, and looked at Bex. She took a deep breath and squeezed her eyes shut, saying, \u201cOut of telling Andi I like her.\u201d</p><p>It took a minute for the realisation to dawn on Bex. \u201cOhhhh,\u201d She whispered, looking at Amber. She smiled comfortingly at her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Amber. Andi won\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d She mumbled, looking up at Bex nervously. \u201cDo you hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPssht, no!\u201d Bex said, waving her hand dismissively. \u201cHow could I hate you when I have my fair share of ex-girlfriends?\u201d She said, placing the bag on the table. When she turned back, the two siblings were staring at her, gobsmacked. </p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d The two of them said, sending Bex giggling. She got up from the arm of the chair, looking at the two. </p><p>\u201cNow, is there anything else I can do for you two?\u201d She said with a smile, the two shaking their heads and making their way to the door. Before leaving, Amber turned back. </p><p>\u201cJust, tell me how she reacts, please?\u201d Amber said, and Bex gave her a thumbs up. </p><p>But TJ didn\u2019t leave. He pulled Amber to him, whispering something to her, before walking back towards Bex. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened TJ?\u201d Bex asked, noticing the way he was pulling at his hoodie. </p><p>TJ kept his gaze focused down as he spoke. \u201cThe thing Kira said to me, when she wanted me to do the costume with her, was would I rather do a costume with Cyrus than with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Bex asked, confused. She leaned back against the counter, looking at TJ. Finally, he looked up at her, his eyes shifty. </p><p>\u201cThe way she asked it, was like she was asking me would I rather do it with a boy than a girl. Like, like she knew I was,\u201d He said quietly, his voice choking up. Bex understood immediately what had happened, and pulled TJ in for a hug. He was stiff at first, but then he hugged her back, her shirt getting slightly wet with tears. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you did it with her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She asked softly after she pulled away. \u201cBecause she found out and you got scared she\u2019d tell someone.\u201d</p><p>TJ just nodded, wiping away the years that had formed. </p><p>Bex pulled him to her by the shoulder. \u201cThat was not good, what she did. You aren\u2019t a coward TJ. And if you tell Cyrus this, he\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he hates me even more?\u201d </p><p>Bex shook her head. \u201cHe won\u2019t. I know Cyrus. He\u2019d get it.\u201d</p><p>TJ sniffed, looking up at Bex. \u201cYou know how she found out, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Bex said, thinking back to all the times Cyrus had spoken about TJ, and the one time TJ had come by with him for something. She had noticed the looks, the touches, the laughs. But she hadnt thought much of it. <i>Young love. </i></p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to tell him that if he asks?\u201d TJ asked. </p><p>Bex just smiled, walking him to the door. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, some of the weaught gone from his walk. \u201cThanks, Bex. And I\u2019m sorry for bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d She said with a smile. \u201cYou and your sister aren\u2019t that bad, TJ Kippen,\u201d She said, before closing the door. </p><p>What an eventful day. Hopefully, everything would work out just fine. </p><p>(And it did, as Bex would see at the party in Andi\u2019s house, with Cyrus and TJ laughing and holding hands, not hiding their feelings. And with Amber and Andi smiling and whispering to each other. Bowie walked up to her and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d And she just smiled, holding onto his waist, looking down at her wedding ring. </p><p>Everything worked out great.)</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p><i>This is so bad I kadjdjdjsj I\u2019m so sorry</i></p><p><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\"><b>Send me prompts and I\u2019ll do them!</b></a><b> </b></p></p>",

Hope you like it! </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Bex groaned as she went to rearrange the makeup brushes on the stand, the afternoon being slower than the rest of the day. Bowie was busy at the Red Rooster, so he couldn&rsquo;t get her a smoothie, and Cece was at home, still upset about the wedding. Bex sighed as she thought back to the explosion at the restaurant, and the eerie silence that had persisted since that day. Of course she got Cece&rsquo;s anger, but it was getting a bit out of hand now. </p><p>As she was deep in thought about the wedding and Miranda&rsquo;s words of warning, the bell at the door chimed, indicating someone&rsquo;s arrival. Bex hastily plastered on a smile before turning around. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, welcome to Cloud 10. How may I,&rdquo; She started, before realising that it didn&rsquo;t look like it was a customer.

She loved \nphotography class; it was the highlight of her day, normally. But today,\n she just wasn&rsquo;t feeling it. She let her mind wander aimlessly. She \nwondered what Bowie was doing at that exact moment. She thought of her \nbaby. She thought of how she was going to tell her mom <i>about </i>the \nbaby. She was planning to tell Celia that night, and she was not looking\n forward to it. She lay her head down on her table, feeling the coolness\n of it&rsquo;s surface on her cheek. She felt her eyelids grow heavy.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Bex?&rdquo; <br/></p><p>She jerked as someone shook her shoulder, and looked up, confused. Ms. Fisher was standing over her. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; <br/></p><p>Her classmates snickered and whispered. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;You were daydreaming, Bex,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher said softly, but not angrily. &ldquo;Did you complete your assignment?&rdquo;</p><p>Bex looked down sullenly at her portfolio. She was supposed to have \nturned in a portrait that day, but she hadn&rsquo;t even touched her camera in\n weeks. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Please see me after class,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher said patiently.</p><!-- more --><p>Bex nodded sullenly. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>The teacher moved on, and she went back to her thoughts. Class flew \nby. When the bell rang, she hung around, waiting for everyone to clear \nout of the room. <br/></p><p>Ms. Fisher closed the classroom door softly. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Did you take the test, honey?&rdquo;</p><p>Bex nodded. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did it go? Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;It was positive.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Ms. Fisher leaned back against one of the classroom tables. &ldquo;Oh, Bex&hellip;&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Bex shrugged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much to say. My life is over. But I decided I&rsquo;m keeping the baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say your life is over,&rdquo; her teacher told her firmly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s \nnot true. Thousands of young mothers go on to finish school, and have \ncareers. There&rsquo;s all kinds of help out there. You have so much \npotential, Bex. You&rsquo;re one of the most promising students I&rsquo;ve ever \nhad.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex widened her eyes in surprise. No teacher had ever said that to her before. &ldquo;Th-thank you?&rdquo;</p><p>Ms. Fisher smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short. You can do anything \nyou put your mind to. I just don&rsquo;t want you to slip through the cracks.&rdquo;\n She paused thoughtfully. &ldquo;And I know that this isn&rsquo;t something you \nplanned on right now, but remember, every life is a gift. This baby \nyou&rsquo;re carrying is a gift, and he or she is here for a reason.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Bex felt her heavy heart lift, just a little. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She hoped her mom would see it that way, but she doubted it.</p><p>&ldquo;About your photo assignment,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some \nevidence that darkroom chemicals may be harmful to unborn babies. I&rsquo;d \nrather you didn&rsquo;t take your chances. So just bring your negatives in, \nand I&rsquo;ll process your assignments for you. I won&rsquo;t take off any points. \nOkay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she nodded. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take care of yourself, okay?&rdquo; Ms. Fisher patted her shoulder encouragingly.</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Bex smiled. She turned to leave the room, then stopped. &ldquo;Ms. Fisher?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t tell anyone about this. I really don&rsquo;t want anyone to \nknow right now.&rdquo; She was fully aware that she was the subject of gossip \nsince Bowie left, more than ever. It was better if as few people knew \nthat she was knocked up as possible. <br/></p><p>Her teacher nodded. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell a soul. Try to have a good afternoon, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>****</p><p>When school finally ended, Bex left as fast as she could. She was \nsurprised to see her dad&rsquo;s car parked at the curb in front of the \nbuilding. Ham saw her and waved her over. She hurried to him, slinging \nher backpack over her shoulder.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sweetie pie,&rdquo; he smiled, opening the passenger door for her. &ldquo;Hop in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, dad?&rdquo; she asked, as she buckled her seat belt. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just thought you might like a ride. I know you have a lot on your mind today.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p><p>Ham pulled away from the curb and drove off. After a long moment of \nsilence, he cleared his throat. &ldquo;This has all got me thinking on when \nyou were born,&rdquo; he said wistfully.</p><p>She looked up curiously through a curtain of hair, which as hanging in her face. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You came into this world kicking and screaming,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I knew you were going to be a handful, and I wasn&rsquo;t wrong.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Bex smiled a little, in spite of her dark mood.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;The day you were born was the happiest day of my life, Bex,&rdquo; he \nsaid. &ldquo;The first time I held you, I knew my life had meaning.&rdquo; He turned\n onto the next street. &ldquo;Not that your mom and I weren&rsquo;t nervous and \nscared about becoming parents. We were. It&rsquo;s hard sometimes. But it&rsquo;s \nrewarding too. The first time your child smiles at you, her first steps,\n first words. It&rsquo;s magical.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, this morning sickness is <i>so </i>magical,&rdquo; Bex said sarcastically.</p><p>Her father chuckled. &ldquo;You know what I mean. Just think about what I \nsaid when things get tough. And they will get tough. Just know that, you\n know, some good will come out of this.&rdquo;</p><p>****<br/></p><p>They pulled into the Mack driveway. Bex followed her dad inside. The \nliving room was dark and quiet. She didn&rsquo;t see Celia sitting on the sofa\n right away. But seeing her there, she knew immediately that something \nwas wrong. &ldquo;Um, hi mom.&rdquo;</p><p>Celia stood up. Bex noticed that her face was streaked with tears, \nher eyes red and bloodshot. &ldquo;Rebecca, you had better explain this to me \nright this second.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Bex looked down at her mom&rsquo;s hand. She was holding the pregnancy \ntest. \u00a0Her mouth hung open. She was too scared to speak, even to call \nher mom out for going through her things. She backed up, closer to her \ndad. Ham put his hands on her shoulders reassuringly.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this yours?&rdquo; her mother asked. &ldquo;Are you pregnant?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Celia,&rdquo; Ham said calmly. &ldquo;Bex needs to talk to you about something \nserious, and she&rsquo;s scared. Please, promise me you&rsquo;ll just hear her out \nbefore you get upset.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m way past upset,&rdquo; Celia snapped. &ldquo;I want to know what&rsquo;s going on this instant!&rdquo;</p><p>Bex gaped at her, unable to make words come out. It was like her brain and tongue had completely disconnected.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;So help me, Rebecca, answer my question!&rdquo; Celia shouted. &ldquo;Are you pregnant?&rdquo;</p><p>Bex&rsquo;s eyes welled with tears. Her father took her hand and squeezed it. &ldquo;Go ahead, honey. You need to tell her the truth.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded slowly, too ashamed to meet her mother&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She \ntook a shaky breath. &ldquo;Mom, please don&rsquo;t be mad. It was an accident. I&rsquo;m \nsorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Celia took a deep breath, and stood up, pointing her finger at Bex. \nThe veins in her neck bulged. She had never looked so angry. &ldquo;Get. Out! \nPack your things and get out of my house!&rdquo;</p><p>Bex sobbed, gasping for breath. This was exactly what she&rsquo;d been \nafraid would happen; that she wouldn&rsquo;t just be pregnant and alone, but \npregnant, alone, <i>and </i>homeless.<br/></p><p><i>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; </i>Ham said firmly, rising to his feet. &ldquo;This is my home \ntoo, and I will not let you put our only daughter out on the street when\n she needs us. I&rsquo;m putting my foot down, Celia!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said I was sorry!&rdquo; Bex pleaded. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean for this to happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could you be so <i>stupid?</i>&rdquo; Celia asked her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re keeping\n this baby, I hope you know that! You made your bed and you&rsquo;re going to \nsleep in it. You&rsquo;re not taking the easy way out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>know,</i> mom!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I was <i>planning </i>to keep it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was, Celia,&rdquo; Ham said softly. &ldquo;She told me so, herself. Give her some credit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And <i>you!</i> I can&rsquo;t believe you <i>knew </i>about this!&rdquo; she accused her husband. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only known for a day!&rdquo; he said defensively. &ldquo;I was just giving \nBex a chance to do the mature thing and come to you, herself. Which she \nwas planning to do tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t raise you like this,&rdquo; Celia said with ice in her voice. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Like what, mom?&rdquo; Bex challenged, a little of her usual fire \nreturning.&ldquo; She cringed, a little bit afraid her mother was going to hit\n her, even if she&rsquo;d never raised a hand to her before. But then again, \nshe&rsquo;d never seen her mom so crazed with anger. It was frightening.<br/></p><p>&quot;To be a whore!&rdquo; Celia shouted. &ldquo;And yet, I&rsquo;m not at all surprised. \nThis is exactly the kind of thing I&rsquo;d expect from you. I should have \nknown you&rsquo;d throw your life away for some boy.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Bex&rsquo;s eyes filled with fresh tears. She almost wished her mom <i>had </i>slapped her. It would have hurt less.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even look at you, Rebecca,&rdquo; her mother said. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I have no daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, Celia,&rdquo; Ham said. But his wife had already rushed off to her room. <br/></p><p>****<br/></p><p>After the fight heard around the world, Bex retreated to her own \nbedroom. She wished she never had to leave it again. She put her \nearphones in and turned her favorite CD on. Her eyes were sore and her \nhead ached from crying. <br/></p><p>A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. She pulled her earphones off. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Celia, get lost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, sweetheart,&rdquo; her father&rsquo;s calm voice answered. &ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she sighed.</p><p>Ham stuck his head in the room. &ldquo;I ordered a pizza. Come downstairs and eat something, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry,&rdquo; she said.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Please, Bex,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;You need to eat something. Pizza always makes you feel better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not eating with <i>her,&rdquo;</i> she said pointedly, referring to Celia.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mother went to bed,&rdquo; Ham told her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll be joining us tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Bex slid off her bed, and followed her dad to the kitchen. \u00a0<br/></p><p>She was surprised to see the pizza was topped with pepperoni, \nsomething her mother wouldn&rsquo;t have approved of. She put a small slice on\n a plate and sat down at the table. She took a bite and chewed, her jaw \ntight from stress. The tension in the house was permeable; it settled \ninto her bones and stayed there. She could feel it all around her. She \nlooked up at her father, sitting across from her at the table. His eyes \nwere downcast, and he seemed just uncomfortable as she was. Everyone was\n miserable, and painfully, she reminded herself that it was all her \nfault.<br/></p><p>She was still eating when Celia shuffled into the kitchen, dressed in\n her bathrobe and rumpled pajamas. She looked terrible. To Bex, it \nlooked as if she had aged ten years in an hour. Her hair was a stringy \nmess, where it was usually pristine. Her face was drawn and \ntear-stained, her eyelids puffy.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have a solution to our problem,&rdquo; she announced tonelessly. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;And that would be?&rdquo; Ham ventured. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;I looked online and found a group home for unwed teenage mothers not\n too far from here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send Rebecca there for her \npregnancy.&rdquo;</p><p>Ham&rsquo;s face reddened.</p><p><i>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</i> Bex shouted, rising to her feet. &ldquo;If you send me there, I&rsquo;ll run away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You stay out of this!&rdquo; Celia snapped. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sending our child to some baby farm, Celia!&rdquo; Ham cried. \n&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t 1960! I&rsquo;d just as soon leave and take Bex with me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you see the trouble you&rsquo;ve caused?&rdquo; Celia asked Bex. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re happy!&rdquo; She began to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone just shut up!&rdquo; Bex shouted, plugging her ears with her \nfingers, like she did when she was a little child. Tears filled her \neyes. She got up and hurried to her room, slamming the door behind her. <br/></p><p>Even with it closed, she could hear her parents fighting, for hours, \nit seemed. Once again, she reminded herself that she&rsquo;d caused it.<br/></p><p>At that moment, she hated Bowie. He was who knew where, living his \ndreams, without a care in the world. He had no idea of the mess he left \nher in. He should have been there, dealing with it with her. This was \njust as much his fault as it was hers; maybe even more. Yet, she was the\n one who had to face the consequences, just because of simple biology.</p><p>She rubbed her flat stomach softly, staring up at the dark ceiling. A\n few glow-in-the-dark stars, leftovers from her childhood, glowed dully.\n For a fleeting second, she entertained the thought that maybe it would \nbe for the best for everyone if she just had a miscarriage. She \nimmediately hated herself. No, it would kill her if she lost her baby. She loved it, and she wanted it \nmore than anything. And she was going to bring it into the world, no \nmatter what. Her baby was an innocent, caught in the middle of \neverything. She hugged her midsection numbly, her eyes filling with tears, blurring the stars on her ceiling.<br/></p><p>Night fell, and Bex didn&rsquo;t leave her bed or talk to anyone. She heard\n her mother shuffle up the stairs to her bedroom. And she heard her dad \npull the sofa bed out in the living room, something that had never \nhappened before, as far as she knew. She pulled her comforter over her \nhead, trying to shut out the world.</p><p>****</p><p>The next morning, Bex dragged herself down to breakfast, and found her parents sitting ominously in the kitchen. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have a solution,&rdquo; Celia said, wiping her mouth daintily with a \nnapkin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay here for a few more months, and when you start to \nshow, you&rsquo;ll go and stay with your Aunt Mei. You&rsquo;ll have the baby \nthere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Bex cried, her voice coming out in a pathetic squeak. Her stomach sunk. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Aunt Mei!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, neither do I,&rdquo; her mother told her. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the answer to \nour problems, and Mei agreed, so this is what we&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s \nsettled.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex look to her father. There was no way he&rsquo;d sign off on this. &ldquo;Dad?&rdquo;</p><p>He gave her a regretful look. But he didn&rsquo;t protest.<br/></p>",

You\u2019re not taking the easy way out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI <i>know,</i> mom!\u201d she cried. \u201cI was <i>planning </i>to keep it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was, Celia,\u201d Ham said softly. \u201cShe told me so, herself. Give her some credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd <i>you!</i> I can\u2019t believe you <i>knew </i>about this!\u201d she accused her husband. <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only known for a day!\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI was just giving \nBex a chance to do the mature thing and come to you, herself. Which she \nwas planning to do tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t raise you like this,\u201d Celia said with ice in her voice. <br></p><p>\u201cLike what, mom?\u201d Bex challenged, a little of her usual fire \nreturning.\u201c She cringed, a little bit afraid her mother was going to hit\n her, even if she\u2019d never raised a hand to her before. But then again, \nshe\u2019d never seen her mom so crazed with anger. It was frightening.<br></p><p>\"To be a whore!\u201d Celia shouted. \u201cAnd yet, I\u2019m not at all surprised. \nThis is exactly the kind of thing I\u2019d expect from you. I should have \nknown you\u2019d throw your life away for some boy.\u201d<br></p><p>Bex\u2019s eyes filled with fresh tears. She almost wished her mom <i>had </i>slapped her. It would have hurt less.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even look at you, Rebecca,\u201d her mother said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I have no daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that, Celia,\u201d Ham said. But his wife had already rushed off to her room. <br></p><p>****<br></p><p>After the fight heard around the world, Bex retreated to her own \nbedroom. She wished she never had to leave it again. She put her \nearphones in and turned her favorite CD on. Her eyes were sore and her \nhead ached from crying. <br></p><p>A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. She pulled her earphones off. \u201cIf it\u2019s Celia, get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, sweetheart,\u201d her father\u2019s calm voice answered. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>Ham stuck his head in the room. \u201cI ordered a pizza. Come downstairs and eat something, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cPlease, Bex,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cYou need to eat something. Pizza always makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not eating with <i>her,\u201d</i> she said pointedly, referring to Celia.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mother went to bed,\u201d Ham told her. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be joining us tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Bex slid off her bed, and followed her dad to the kitchen. \u00a0<br></p><p>She was surprised to see the pizza was topped with pepperoni, \nsomething her mother wouldn\u2019t have approved of. She put a small slice on\n a plate and sat down at the table. She took a bite and chewed, her jaw \ntight from stress. The tension in the house was permeable; it settled \ninto her bones and stayed there. She could feel it all around her. She \nlooked up at her father, sitting across from her at the table. His eyes \nwere downcast, and he seemed just uncomfortable as she was. Everyone was\n miserable, and painfully, she reminded herself that it was all her \nfault.<br></p><p>She was still eating when Celia shuffled into the kitchen, dressed in\n her bathrobe and rumpled pajamas. She looked terrible. To Bex, it \nlooked as if she had aged ten years in an hour. Her hair was a stringy \nmess, where it was usually pristine. Her face was drawn and \ntear-stained, her eyelids puffy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have a solution to our problem,\u201d she announced tonelessly. <br></p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d Ham ventured. <br></p><p>\u201cI looked online and found a group home for unwed teenage mothers not\n too far from here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll send Rebecca there for her \npregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Ham\u2019s face reddened.</p><p><i>\u201cNo!\u201d</i> Bex shouted, rising to her feet. \u201cIf you send me there, I\u2019ll run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay out of this!\u201d Celia snapped. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sending our child to some baby farm, Celia!\u201d Ham cried. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t 1960! I\u2019d just as soon leave and take Bex with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see the trouble you\u2019ve caused?\u201d Celia asked Bex. \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy!\u201d She began to cry.</p><p>\u201cEveryone just shut up!\u201d Bex shouted, plugging her ears with her \nfingers, like she did when she was a little child. Tears filled her \neyes. She got up and hurried to her room, slamming the door behind her. <br></p><p>Even with it closed, she could hear her parents fighting, for hours, \nit seemed. Once again, she reminded herself that she\u2019d caused it.<br></p><p>At that moment, she hated Bowie. He was who knew where, living his \ndreams, without a care in the world. He had no idea of the mess he left \nher in. He should have been there, dealing with it with her. This was \njust as much his fault as it was hers; maybe even more. Yet, she was the\n one who had to face the consequences, just because of simple biology.</p><p>She rubbed her flat stomach softly, staring up at the dark ceiling. A\n few glow-in-the-dark stars, leftovers from her childhood, glowed dully.\n For a fleeting second, she entertained the thought that maybe it would \nbe for the best for everyone if she just had a miscarriage. She \nimmediately hated herself. No, it would kill her if she lost her baby. She loved it, and she wanted it \nmore than anything. And she was going to bring it into the world, no \nmatter what. Her baby was an innocent, caught in the middle of \neverything. She hugged her midsection numbly, her eyes filling with tears, blurring the stars on her ceiling.<br></p><p>Night fell, and Bex didn\u2019t leave her bed or talk to anyone. She heard\n her mother shuffle up the stairs to her bedroom. And she heard her dad \npull the sofa bed out in the living room, something that had never \nhappened before, as far as she knew. She pulled her comforter over her \nhead, trying to shut out the world.</p><p>****</p><p>The next morning, Bex dragged herself down to breakfast, and found her parents sitting ominously in the kitchen. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a solution,\u201d Celia said, wiping her mouth daintily with a \nnapkin. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here for a few more months, and when you start to \nshow, you\u2019ll go and stay with your Aunt Mei. You\u2019ll have the baby \nthere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Bex cried, her voice coming out in a pathetic squeak. Her stomach sunk. \u201cI don\u2019t like Aunt Mei!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither do I,\u201d her mother told her. \u201cBut it\u2019s the answer to \nour problems, and Mei agreed, so this is what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s \nsettled.\u201d</p><p>Bex look to her father. There was no way he\u2019d sign off on this. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a regretful look. But he didn\u2019t protest.<br></p>",

She loved \nphotography class; it was the highlight of her day, normally. But today,\n she just wasn\u2019t feeling it. She let her mind wander aimlessly. She \nwondered what Bowie was doing at that exact moment. She thought of her \nbaby. She thought of how she was going to tell her mom <i>about </i>the \nbaby. She was planning to tell Celia that night, and she was not looking\n forward to it. She lay her head down on her table, feeling the coolness\n of it\u2019s surface on her cheek. She felt her eyelids grow heavy.<br></p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d <br></p><p>She jerked as someone shook her shoulder, and looked up, confused. Ms. Fisher was standing over her. \u201cHuh?\u201d <br></p><p>Her classmates snickered and whispered. <br></p><p>\u201cYou were daydreaming, Bex,\u201d Ms. Fisher said softly, but not angrily. \u201cDid you complete your assignment?\u201d</p><p>Bex looked down sullenly at her portfolio. She was supposed to have \nturned in a portrait that day, but she hadn\u2019t even touched her camera in\n weeks. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cPlease see me after class,\u201d Ms. Fisher said patiently.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Bex nodded sullenly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The teacher moved on, and she went back to her thoughts. Class flew \nby. When the bell rang, she hung around, waiting for everyone to clear \nout of the room. <br></p><p>Ms. Fisher closed the classroom door softly. \u201cHow are you?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you take the test, honey?\u201d</p><p>Bex nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it go? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt was positive.\u201d<br></p><p>Ms. Fisher leaned back against one of the classroom tables. \u201cOh, Bex\u2026\u201d she sighed. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br></p><p>Bex shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to say. My life is over. But I decided I\u2019m keeping the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say your life is over,\u201d her teacher told her firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s \nnot true. Thousands of young mothers go on to finish school, and have \ncareers. There\u2019s all kinds of help out there. You have so much \npotential, Bex. You\u2019re one of the most promising students I\u2019ve ever \nhad.\u201d</p><p>Bex widened her eyes in surprise. No teacher had ever said that to her before. \u201cTh-thank you?\u201d</p><p>Ms. Fisher smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short. You can do anything \nyou put your mind to. I just don\u2019t want you to slip through the cracks.\u201d\n She paused thoughtfully. \u201cAnd I know that this isn\u2019t something you \nplanned on right now, but remember, every life is a gift. This baby \nyou\u2019re carrying is a gift, and he or she is here for a reason.\u201d<br></p><p>Bex felt her heavy heart lift, just a little. \u201cThank you.\u201d She hoped her mom would see it that way, but she doubted it.</p><p>\u201cAbout your photo assignment,\u201d Ms. Fisher went on. \u201cThere\u2019s some \nevidence that darkroom chemicals may be harmful to unborn babies. I\u2019d \nrather you didn\u2019t take your chances. So just bring your negatives in, \nand I\u2019ll process your assignments for you. I won\u2019t take off any points. \nOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, okay?\u201d Ms. Fisher patted her shoulder encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Bex smiled. She turned to leave the room, then stopped. \u201cMs. Fisher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t tell anyone about this. I really don\u2019t want anyone to \nknow right now.\u201d She was fully aware that she was the subject of gossip \nsince Bowie left, more than ever. It was better if as few people knew \nthat she was knocked up as possible. <br></p><p>Her teacher nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t tell a soul. Try to have a good afternoon, honey.\u201d</p><p>****</p><p>When school finally ended, Bex left as fast as she could. She was \nsurprised to see her dad\u2019s car parked at the curb in front of the \nbuilding. Ham saw her and waved her over. She hurried to him, slinging \nher backpack over her shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie pie,\u201d he smiled, opening the passenger door for her. \u201cHop in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, dad?\u201d she asked, as she buckled her seat belt. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought you might like a ride. I know you have a lot on your mind today.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Ham pulled away from the curb and drove off. After a long moment of \nsilence, he cleared his throat. \u201cThis has all got me thinking on when \nyou were born,\u201d he said wistfully.</p><p>She looked up curiously through a curtain of hair, which as hanging in her face. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came into this world kicking and screaming,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI knew you were going to be a handful, and I wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d<br></p><p>Bex smiled a little, in spite of her dark mood.<br></p><p>\u201cThe day you were born was the happiest day of my life, Bex,\u201d he \nsaid. \u201cThe first time I held you, I knew my life had meaning.\u201d He turned\n onto the next street. \u201cNot that your mom and I weren\u2019t nervous and \nscared about becoming parents. We were. It\u2019s hard sometimes. But it\u2019s \nrewarding too. The first time your child smiles at you, her first steps,\n first words. It\u2019s magical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this morning sickness is <i>so </i>magical,\u201d Bex said sarcastically.</p><p>Her father chuckled. \u201cYou know what I mean. Just think about what I \nsaid when things get tough. And they will get tough. Just know that, you\n know, some good will come out of this.\u201d</p><p>****<br></p><p>They pulled into the Mack driveway. Bex followed her dad inside. The \nliving room was dark and quiet. She didn\u2019t see Celia sitting on the sofa\n right away. But seeing her there, she knew immediately that something \nwas wrong. \u201cUm, hi mom.\u201d</p><p>Celia stood up. Bex noticed that her face was streaked with tears, \nher eyes red and bloodshot. \u201cRebecca, you had better explain this to me \nright this second.\u201d<br></p><p>Bex looked down at her mom\u2019s hand. She was holding the pregnancy \ntest. \u00a0Her mouth hung open. She was too scared to speak, even to call \nher mom out for going through her things. She backed up, closer to her \ndad. Ham put his hands on her shoulders reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cIs this yours?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCelia,\u201d Ham said calmly. \u201cBex needs to talk to you about something \nserious, and she\u2019s scared. Please, promise me you\u2019ll just hear her out \nbefore you get upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m way past upset,\u201d Celia snapped. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on this instant!\u201d</p><p>Bex gaped at her, unable to make words come out. It was like her brain and tongue had completely disconnected.<br></p><p>\u201cSo help me, Rebecca, answer my question!\u201d Celia shouted. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Bex\u2019s eyes welled with tears. Her father took her hand and squeezed it. \u201cGo ahead, honey. You need to tell her the truth.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly, too ashamed to meet her mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d She \ntook a shaky breath. \u201cMom, please don\u2019t be mad. It was an accident. I\u2019m \nsorry\u2026\u201d</p><p>Celia took a deep breath, and stood up, pointing her finger at Bex. \nThe veins in her neck bulged. She had never looked so angry. \u201cGet. Out! \nPack your things and get out of my house!\u201d</p><p>Bex sobbed, gasping for breath. This was exactly what she\u2019d been \nafraid would happen; that she wouldn\u2019t just be pregnant and alone, but \npregnant, alone, <i>and </i>homeless.<br></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d </i>Ham said firmly, rising to his feet. \u201cThis is my home \ntoo, and I will not let you put our only daughter out on the street when\n she needs us. I\u2019m putting my foot down, Celia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I was sorry!\u201d Bex pleaded. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for this to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you be so <i>stupid?</i>\u201d Celia asked her. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping\n this baby, I hope you know that! You made your bed and you\u2019re going to \nsleep in it. You\u2019re not taking the easy way out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI <i>know,</i> mom!\u201d she cried. \u201cI was <i>planning </i>to keep it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was, Celia,\u201d Ham said softly. \u201cShe told me so, herself. Give her some credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd <i>you!</i> I can\u2019t believe you <i>knew </i>about this!\u201d she accused her husband. <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only known for a day!\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI was just giving \nBex a chance to do the mature thing and come to you, herself. Which she \nwas planning to do tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t raise you like this,\u201d Celia said with ice in her voice. <br></p><p>\u201cLike what, mom?\u201d Bex challenged, a little of her usual fire \nreturning.\u201c She cringed, a little bit afraid her mother was going to hit\n her, even if she\u2019d never raised a hand to her before. But then again, \nshe\u2019d never seen her mom so crazed with anger. It was frightening.<br></p><p>\"To be a whore!\u201d Celia shouted. \u201cAnd yet, I\u2019m not at all surprised. \nThis is exactly the kind of thing I\u2019d expect from you. I should have \nknown you\u2019d throw your life away for some boy.\u201d<br></p><p>Bex\u2019s eyes filled with fresh tears. She almost wished her mom <i>had </i>slapped her. It would have hurt less.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even look at you, Rebecca,\u201d her mother said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I have no daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that, Celia,\u201d Ham said. But his wife had already rushed off to her room. <br></p><p>****<br></p><p>After the fight heard around the world, Bex retreated to her own \nbedroom. She wished she never had to leave it again. She put her \nearphones in and turned her favorite CD on. Her eyes were sore and her \nhead ached from crying. <br></p><p>A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. She pulled her earphones off. \u201cIf it\u2019s Celia, get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, sweetheart,\u201d her father\u2019s calm voice answered. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>Ham stuck his head in the room. \u201cI ordered a pizza. Come downstairs and eat something, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cPlease, Bex,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cYou need to eat something. Pizza always makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not eating with <i>her,\u201d</i> she said pointedly, referring to Celia.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mother went to bed,\u201d Ham told her. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be joining us tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Bex slid off her bed, and followed her dad to the kitchen. \u00a0<br></p><p>She was surprised to see the pizza was topped with pepperoni, \nsomething her mother wouldn\u2019t have approved of. She put a small slice on\n a plate and sat down at the table. She took a bite and chewed, her jaw \ntight from stress. The tension in the house was permeable; it settled \ninto her bones and stayed there. She could feel it all around her. She \nlooked up at her father, sitting across from her at the table. His eyes \nwere downcast, and he seemed just uncomfortable as she was. Everyone was\n miserable, and painfully, she reminded herself that it was all her \nfault.<br></p><p>She was still eating when Celia shuffled into the kitchen, dressed in\n her bathrobe and rumpled pajamas. She looked terrible. To Bex, it \nlooked as if she had aged ten years in an hour. Her hair was a stringy \nmess, where it was usually pristine. Her face was drawn and \ntear-stained, her eyelids puffy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have a solution to our problem,\u201d she announced tonelessly. <br></p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d Ham ventured. <br></p><p>\u201cI looked online and found a group home for unwed teenage mothers not\n too far from here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll send Rebecca there for her \npregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Ham\u2019s face reddened.</p><p><i>\u201cNo!\u201d</i> Bex shouted, rising to her feet. \u201cIf you send me there, I\u2019ll run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay out of this!\u201d Celia snapped. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sending our child to some baby farm, Celia!\u201d Ham cried. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t 1960! I\u2019d just as soon leave and take Bex with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see the trouble you\u2019ve caused?\u201d Celia asked Bex. \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy!\u201d She began to cry.</p><p>\u201cEveryone just shut up!\u201d Bex shouted, plugging her ears with her \nfingers, like she did when she was a little child. Tears filled her \neyes. She got up and hurried to her room, slamming the door behind her. <br></p><p>Even with it closed, she could hear her parents fighting, for hours, \nit seemed. Once again, she reminded herself that she\u2019d caused it.<br></p><p>At that moment, she hated Bowie. He was who knew where, living his \ndreams, without a care in the world. He had no idea of the mess he left \nher in. He should have been there, dealing with it with her. This was \njust as much his fault as it was hers; maybe even more. Yet, she was the\n one who had to face the consequences, just because of simple biology.</p><p>She rubbed her flat stomach softly, staring up at the dark ceiling. A\n few glow-in-the-dark stars, leftovers from her childhood, glowed dully.\n For a fleeting second, she entertained the thought that maybe it would \nbe for the best for everyone if she just had a miscarriage. She \nimmediately hated herself. No, it would kill her if she lost her baby. She loved it, and she wanted it \nmore than anything. And she was going to bring it into the world, no \nmatter what. Her baby was an innocent, caught in the middle of \neverything. She hugged her midsection numbly, her eyes filling with tears, blurring the stars on her ceiling.<br></p><p>Night fell, and Bex didn\u2019t leave her bed or talk to anyone. She heard\n her mother shuffle up the stairs to her bedroom. And she heard her dad \npull the sofa bed out in the living room, something that had never \nhappened before, as far as she knew. She pulled her comforter over her \nhead, trying to shut out the world.</p><p>****</p><p>The next morning, Bex dragged herself down to breakfast, and found her parents sitting ominously in the kitchen. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a solution,\u201d Celia said, wiping her mouth daintily with a \nnapkin. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here for a few more months, and when you start to \nshow, you\u2019ll go and stay with your Aunt Mei. You\u2019ll have the baby \nthere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Bex cried, her voice coming out in a pathetic squeak. Her stomach sunk. \u201cI don\u2019t like Aunt Mei!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither do I,\u201d her mother told her. \u201cBut it\u2019s the answer to \nour problems, and Mei agreed, so this is what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s \nsettled.\u201d</p><p>Bex look to her father. There was no way he\u2019d sign off on this. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a regretful look. But he didn\u2019t protest.<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>Chapter 14. What To Expect When You&rsquo;re Knocked Up<br /></p><p>Bex rested her chin on her hand and closed her eyes. She loved \nphotography class; it was the highlight of her day, normally. But today,\n she just wasn&rsquo;t feeling it. She let her mind wander aimlessly. She \nwondered what Bowie was doing at that exact moment. She thought of her \nbaby. She thought of how she was going to tell her mom <i>about </i>the \nbaby. She was planning to tell Celia that night, and she was not looking\n forward to it. She lay her head down on her table, feeling the coolness\n of it&rsquo;s surface on her cheek. She felt her eyelids grow heavy.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bex?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>She jerked as someone shook her shoulder, and looked up, confused. Ms. Fisher was standing over her. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Her classmates snickered and whispered. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You were daydreaming, Bex,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher said softly, but not angrily. &ldquo;Did you complete your assignment?&rdquo;</p><p>Bex looked down sullenly at her portfolio. She was supposed to have \nturned in a portrait that day, but she hadn&rsquo;t even touched her camera in\n weeks. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Please see me after class,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher said patiently.</p><p>Bex nodded sullenly. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>The teacher moved on, and she went back to her thoughts. Class flew \nby. When the bell rang, she hung around, waiting for everyone to clear \nout of the room. <br /></p><p>Ms. Fisher closed the classroom door softly. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Did you take the test, honey?&rdquo;</p><p>Bex nodded. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did it go? Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;It was positive.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ms. Fisher leaned back against one of the classroom tables. &ldquo;Oh, Bex&hellip;&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bex shrugged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much to say. My life is over. But I decided I&rsquo;m keeping the baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say your life is over,&rdquo; her teacher told her firmly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s \nnot true. Thousands of young mothers go on to finish school, and have \ncareers. There&rsquo;s all kinds of help out there. You have so much \npotential, Bex. You&rsquo;re one of the most promising students I&rsquo;ve ever \nhad.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex widened her eyes in surprise. No teacher had ever said that to her before. &ldquo;Th-thank you?&rdquo;</p><p>Ms. Fisher smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short. You can do anything \nyou put your mind to. I just don&rsquo;t want you to slip through the cracks.&rdquo;\n She paused thoughtfully. &ldquo;And I know that this isn&rsquo;t something you \nplanned on right now, but remember, every life is a gift. This baby \nyou&rsquo;re carrying is a gift, and he or she is here for a reason.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bex felt her heavy heart lift, just a little. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She hoped her mom would see it that way, but she doubted it.</p><p>&ldquo;About your photo assignment,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some \nevidence that darkroom chemicals may be harmful to unborn babies. I&rsquo;d \nrather you didn&rsquo;t take your chances. So just bring your negatives in, \nand I&rsquo;ll process your assignments for you. I won&rsquo;t take off any points. \nOkay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she nodded. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take care of yourself, okay?&rdquo; Ms. Fisher patted her shoulder encouragingly.</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Bex smiled. She turned to leave the room, then stopped. &ldquo;Ms. Fisher?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t tell anyone about this. I really don&rsquo;t want anyone to \nknow right now.&rdquo; She was fully aware that she was the subject of gossip \nsince Bowie left, more than ever. It was better if as few people knew \nthat she was knocked up as possible. <br /></p><p>Her teacher nodded. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell a soul. Try to have a good afternoon, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>****</p><p>When school finally ended, Bex left as fast as she could. She was \nsurprised to see her dad&rsquo;s car parked at the curb in front of the \nbuilding. Ham saw her and waved her over. She hurried to him, slinging \nher backpack over her shoulder.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sweetie pie,&rdquo; he smiled, opening the passenger door for her. &ldquo;Hop in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, dad?&rdquo; she asked, as she buckled her seat belt. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just thought you might like a ride. I know you have a lot on your mind today.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p><p>Ham pulled away from the curb and drove off. After a long moment of \nsilence, he cleared his throat. &ldquo;This has all got me thinking on when \nyou were born,&rdquo; he said wistfully.</p><p>She looked up curiously through a curtain of hair, which as hanging in her face. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You came into this world kicking and screaming,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I knew you were going to be a handful, and I wasn&rsquo;t wrong.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bex smiled a little, in spite of her dark mood.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The day you were born was the happiest day of my life, Bex,&rdquo; he \nsaid. &ldquo;The first time I held you, I knew my life had meaning.&rdquo; He turned\n onto the next street. &ldquo;Not that your mom and I weren&rsquo;t nervous and \nscared about becoming parents. We were. It&rsquo;s hard sometimes. But it&rsquo;s \nrewarding too. The first time your child smiles at you, her first steps,\n first words. It&rsquo;s magical.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, this morning sickness is <i>so </i>magical,&rdquo; Bex said sarcastically.</p><p>Her father chuckled. &ldquo;You know what I mean. Just think about what I \nsaid when things get tough. And they will get tough. Just know that, you\n know, some good will come out of this.&rdquo;</p><p>****<br /></p><p>They pulled into the Mack driveway. Bex followed her dad inside. The \nliving room was dark and quiet. She didn&rsquo;t see Celia sitting on the sofa\n right away. But seeing her there, she knew immediately that something \nwas wrong. &ldquo;Um, hi mom.&rdquo;</p><p>Celia stood up. Bex noticed that her face was streaked with tears, \nher eyes red and bloodshot. &ldquo;Rebecca, you had better explain this to me \nright this second.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bex looked down at her mom&rsquo;s hand. She was holding the pregnancy \ntest. &nbsp;Her mouth hung open. She was too scared to speak, even to call \nher mom out for going through her things. She backed up, closer to her \ndad. Ham put his hands on her shoulders reassuringly.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this yours?&rdquo; her mother asked. &ldquo;Are you pregnant?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Celia,&rdquo; Ham said calmly. &ldquo;Bex needs to talk to you about something \nserious, and she&rsquo;s scared. Please, promise me you&rsquo;ll just hear her out \nbefore you get upset.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m way past upset,&rdquo; Celia snapped. &ldquo;I want to know what&rsquo;s going on this instant!&rdquo;</p><p>Bex gaped at her, unable to make words come out. It was like her brain and tongue had completely disconnected.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So help me, Rebecca, answer my question!&rdquo; Celia shouted. &ldquo;Are you pregnant?&rdquo;</p><p>Bex&rsquo;s eyes welled with tears. Her father took her hand and squeezed it. &ldquo;Go ahead, honey. You need to tell her the truth.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded slowly, too ashamed to meet her mother&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She \ntook a shaky breath. &ldquo;Mom, please don&rsquo;t be mad. It was an accident. I&rsquo;m \nsorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Celia took a deep breath, and stood up, pointing her finger at Bex. \nThe veins in her neck bulged. She had never looked so angry. &ldquo;Get. Out! \nPack your things and get out of my house!&rdquo;</p><p>Bex sobbed, gasping for breath. This was exactly what she&rsquo;d been \nafraid would happen; that she wouldn&rsquo;t just be pregnant and alone, but \npregnant, alone, <i>and </i>homeless.<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; </i>Ham said firmly, rising to his feet. &ldquo;This is my home \ntoo, and I will not let you put our only daughter out on the street when\n she needs us. I&rsquo;m putting my foot down, Celia!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said I was sorry!&rdquo; Bex pleaded. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean for this to happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could you be so <i>stupid?</i>&rdquo; Celia asked her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re keeping\n this baby, I hope you know that! You made your bed and you&rsquo;re going to \nsleep in it. You&rsquo;re not taking the easy way out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>know,</i> mom!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I was <i>planning </i>to keep it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was, Celia,&rdquo; Ham said softly. &ldquo;She told me so, herself. Give her some credit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And <i>you!</i> I can&rsquo;t believe you <i>knew </i>about this!&rdquo; she accused her husband. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only known for a day!&rdquo; he said defensively. &ldquo;I was just giving \nBex a chance to do the mature thing and come to you, herself. Which she \nwas planning to do tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t raise you like this,&rdquo; Celia said with ice in her voice. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like what, mom?&rdquo; Bex challenged, a little of her usual fire \nreturning.&ldquo; She cringed, a little bit afraid her mother was going to hit\n her, even if she&rsquo;d never raised a hand to her before. But then again, \nshe&rsquo;d never seen her mom so crazed with anger. It was frightening.<br /></p><p>\"To be a whore!&rdquo; Celia shouted. &ldquo;And yet, I&rsquo;m not at all surprised. \nThis is exactly the kind of thing I&rsquo;d expect from you. I should have \nknown you&rsquo;d throw your life away for some boy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bex&rsquo;s eyes filled with fresh tears. She almost wished her mom <i>had </i>slapped her. It would have hurt less.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even look at you, Rebecca,&rdquo; her mother said. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I have no daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, Celia,&rdquo; Ham said. But his wife had already rushed off to her room. <br /></p><p>****<br /></p><p>After the fight heard around the world, Bex retreated to her own \nbedroom. She wished she never had to leave it again. She put her \nearphones in and turned her favorite CD on. Her eyes were sore and her \nhead ached from crying. <br /></p><p>A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. She pulled her earphones off. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Celia, get lost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, sweetheart,&rdquo; her father&rsquo;s calm voice answered. &ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she sighed.</p><p>Ham stuck his head in the room. &ldquo;I ordered a pizza. Come downstairs and eat something, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Please, Bex,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;You need to eat something. Pizza always makes you feel better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not eating with <i>her,&rdquo;</i> she said pointedly, referring to Celia.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mother went to bed,&rdquo; Ham told her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll be joining us tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Bex slid off her bed, and followed her dad to the kitchen. &nbsp;<br /></p><p>She was surprised to see the pizza was topped with pepperoni, \nsomething her mother wouldn&rsquo;t have approved of.
