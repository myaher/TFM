Qui Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to end the dispute. They rescue the planet&rsquo;s ruler, Queen Padme Amidala and are forced to retreat to Tatooine where they meet Anakin Skywalker. Recognising his immense yet untrained potential in the force, Qui Gon arranges for Anakin&rsquo;s freedom and takes him back to Coruscant. The Galactic Republic&rsquo;s inability to settle the matter on Naboo reveals the ineffectiveness of the Senate and allows Palpatine to not only vote the Supreme Chancellor out of office, but also seize power for himself. Qui Gon, Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme return to Naboo to remove the blockade by force. Maul confronts then and cuts down Qui Gon before being dealt a mortal wound himself.

The assassination fails, Anakin is tasked with her protection and the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan hunts the would be assassins and discovers the Clone Army on Kamino. Fearing they have no other choice, the Senate grants the chancellor emergency powers, gives the Jedi Order command of the clones, and the Clone War begins.

She escapes the attempt on her life and becomes a bounty hunter.
