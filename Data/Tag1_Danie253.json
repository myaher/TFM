Dan spoke to Lela, Eric, and Kate but it was always in a quiet, afraid voice. Lela was used to the emotional rollercoaster that was Dan when he was regressed but now he seemed rather stoic.</p><p>There had only been one incident since his slip, which was nearly a week ago now. He\u2019d been in the canteen, eating dinner with Kate and Eric. Kate was wolfing down her food, clearly hungry, while Eric picked at - but still ate - his meal. Dan had been having the meals served in the children\u2019s wing, enjoying the dinosaur chicken nuggets more than the regular ones.</p><p>One of the kitchen staff had accidentally left some food in the oven a little too long, causing the smoke alarms to go off. Being the hospital that they were, sprinklers were everywhere, meaning as soon as the alarms went off, every patient was being sprayed with water.</p><p>At first, there had been no reaction, just everyone looking to the nurses to help them go where they needed to go. Though once about half the people had left the room and the other half were thoroughly drenched, Dan\u2019s screams kicked in. He was laying on the ground, twitching and shuddering and screaming the most terrible screams Lela had ever heard.</p><p>Everyone was panicked from the fire and the screams, causing all-out chaos in the psychiatric ward. One of the younger adults had ran into the kitchen, the fire triggering him to relapse and need to feel the burn. Another, more older lady, collapsed and was wheeled to the emergency ward, where it was discovered she\u2019d suffered cardiac arrest as a result of a panic attack, her aged heart not being able to pump blood fast enough.</p><p>Eric and Kate had handled the situation pretty well, considering the kitchen was on fire and their friend was screaming on the ground looking like he was having a seizure. Lela and the other doctors were all in the room, watching for their patients to make sure they made it out safely and didn\u2019t have any relapses.</p><p>Lela was only concerned with Dan, even though she did have other patients who lived in the hospital. The other two in-patients she worked with were both well on their way to recovery and Lela had no doubt they\u2019d be able to handle the situation properly. Dan, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She ran up to him, slamming her knees into the tiled floor as she climbed onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cDan? Dan can you hear me?\u201d she tried, getting absolutely no response. \u201cDan! I need you to wake up now, you\u2019ll feel really light and on the count of three, you\u2019ll be fully awake. Okay? One, two, three.\u201d</p><p>Dan lay still, the shaking stopping. He didn\u2019t open his eyes though and a minute after he\u2019d stilled, the convulsing picked up worse than it was before. Between the screams, Dan was begging for it to stop. Lela had no idea what to do, the bring him from hypnosis hadn\u2019t worked, not that Dan was under at the moment. She signaled a nurse over, knowing there was no other option but to sedate him. She felt she did this a lot, and she really did, but sometimes there was no other option. Like now, if she left Dan to himself, who knew what kind of damage - physical or mental - it could cause. No, sedating Dan, while seeming horrible, was best for him.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>Louise packed her small handbag and climbed into the car, turning the ignition as she adjusted the rear-view mirror. She was heading towards HM Wandsworth Penitentiary, the prison where Phil was being kept. It had been two weeks since the end of the trial and Phil\u2019s parents had visited him in the first week. They had said she could visit along with another friend the next week, knowing Phil would want to see his friends again. Pj was meeting her there, each living on opposite sides of the prison.</p><p>\u201cHi love,\u201d she said, pulling Pj into a hug.</p><p>\u201cHey Lou,\u201d Pj replied. They turned towards the prison, sparing a glance with each other before they began walking towards the big sign that read \u2018visitation\u2019. \u201cHow do you think he\u2019s going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d Louise replied. \u201cI\u2019d like to say he\u2019s perfectly fine but you and I both know Phil is too soft for prison. I\u2019m worried he will have become a punching bag by this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that,\u201d Pj scolded, holding the door open for Louise to enter the cool building.</p><p>\u201cWho are you here to see?\u201d a guard asked, holding his hand out before they could walk through to the area where Phil would be waiting.</p><p>\u201cPhil, Philip Lester,\u201d Pj answered, his friend\u2019s full name sounding strange on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAh, Lester. He\u2019s in there,\u201d the man said, stepping aside and gesturing to the room behind him.</p><p>\u201cLou!\u201d a voice shouted, causing her to look towards the sound, seeing a fully grown man, with tears in his eyes, running towards her. \u201cPeej! God am I glad to see you.\u201d After hugging them both tight, he led them to the table he\u2019d been allocated and took a seat.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might have not come,\u201d Phil said, looking down. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt Dan, I swear. I never wanted any of-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d he was cut of by Louise, her hand going to rest atop his. \u201cWe know you\u2019re innocent. You don\u2019t need to explain yourself to us. We know you love Dan, don\u2019t worry, love,\u201d she said, giving him a hopefully comforting smile.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Phil asked. He felt like he was saying that a lot, but it couldn\u2019t be anywhere near as much as he was thinking it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him, Phil. How are you holding up?\u201d Pj suddenly said, sending a wary glance in Louise\u2019s view.</p><p>Phil furrowed his brows. He didn\u2019t like how his friends were just brushing off his question. Had something happened? At least when his parents had told him he was good he\u2019d got an answer. He\u2019d known it was a lie but at least they\u2019d tried.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I need to know how he is,\u201d Phil tried, desperate to know how his boyfriend was.</p><p>Pj sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s scared, Phil. He\u2019s so scared and the doctors don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Recently he started screaming when water came near him and it\u2019s not like that\u2019s something he can avoid forever, he needs to drink it for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Louise put her hand on his shoulder, calming him. \u201cI know you weren\u2019t there and didn\u2019t have anything to do with it, but do you have any ideas why Dan would be scared of water?\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cReady for some fun?\u201d Sir asked, grinning as he brandished a taser and the familiar blade Phil had been using on Dan\u2019s skin for the past couple of days.</p><p>\u201cPlease just let us go,\u201d Phil tried, knowing it was pointless. It was basically routine at this point. Beg Sir to let them go, eat whatever drugged food Phil was being made to have that day, then carve the words into Dan and wait for him to pass out from blood loss. It always ended then, Sir didn\u2019t seem to see the point in carving the words if Dan wasn\u2019t conscious for the pain.</p><p>Today was different from those days though; a taser had never been involved before and Phil felt sick just thinking about what could happen with it.</p><p>They went through the unfortunately usual routine. Phil ate, slowly lost control of his limbs, and then was dragged over to Dan\u2019s limp body.</p><p>\u201cHi love, you\u2019re a good boy, remember that for me, can you?\u201d Dan sobbed and shook, nodding despite himself.</p><p>The new word began to form itself into Dan\u2019s perfect light brown skin. The \u2018o\u2019s hurt the most. After the words \u2018good fuck\u2019 were finished being carved, Sir moved Phil\u2019s hand back over the circles. He placed the blade in Phil\u2019s hand at the top and slowly started cutting down as if he were cutting some meat for dinner. The bright red of the muscle under Dan\u2019s skin was clearly sore, blood dripping from it as his stomach convulsed, the muscle abused and unused to the torture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with this part,\u201d Sir laughed, picking up two squares from the bed and putting them over the two open bits of skin. At first, Phil was confused, thinking they were bandaids, until he realised he was very, very wrong. Little wires hooked up to the pads, making Dan look similar to how he had when he\u2019d first arrived at the hospital after being rescued.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d Sir said, dropping a device into Phil\u2019s lap and causing the cords to tug on Dan\u2019s tender stomach.</p><p>\u201cNow Danny, I want you to beg. Remember how much you enjoyed this last time, princess? It\u2019ll be even better this time, I promise.\u201d The words \u2018last time\u2019 rung in Phil\u2019s ears as Dan instantly began mumbling pleas. Phil didn\u2019t think he was really aware of what he was begging for, just wanting to please Sir to maybe lessen the pain.</p><p>\u201cWell, Phil? Who are you to deny Danny what he wants?\u201d Phil glowered as Sir leant over him, pressing his thumb to the dial to turn it up to its second highest setting. When Phil didn\u2019t move his thumb, which he was slowly gaining control of again, Sir verbally growled. He pressed the dial up to the highest setting and pressed Phil\u2019s thumb into the button. Dan\u2019s screams rung so loud Phil was surprised that no neighbors came to check on them. The screaming didn\u2019t stop for a minute, even after the stimulus stopped. \u201cSuck a fucking wimp,\u201d Sir chuckled, picking up the blade again to quickly carve \u2018wimp\u2019 into his skin.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cElectrocution,\u201d Phil said suddenly. Pj and Louise exchanged looks, ones that said \u2018are we sure he\u2019s innocent if he answered so quickly and confidently?\u2019 \u201cIt happened at our flat. There wasn\u2019t any water but I\u2019d bet they\u2019d done it at the cabin with water,\u201d he explained, sad his friends actually thought he could be guilty.</p><p>They nodded, promising to share the information with Lela. Pj asked again how Phil was and he answered with his usual response - \u201cI\u2019m as good as I can be\u201d - and they spoke for maybe half an hour longer before Louise had to get going to pick up Darcy from school. Pj said he\u2019d better get going at the same time and Phil couldn\u2019t help but think it was because he didn\u2019t want to be in Phil\u2019s presence any longer. He knew it was mad, and that they were his friends, but his mind didn\u2019t like to listen to reason so it thought what it wanted.</p><p>Phil hugged them goodbye before heading back to his cell. Boston was getting out at the end of the week, having cleared his parole and been given early release with a good behaviour bond.

Dan spoke to Lela, Eric, and Kate but it was always in a quiet, afraid voice. Lela was used to the emotional rollercoaster that was Dan when he was regressed but now he seemed rather stoic.</p><p>There had only been one incident since his slip, which was nearly a week ago now. He\u2019d been in the canteen, eating dinner with Kate and Eric. Kate was wolfing down her food, clearly hungry, while Eric picked at - but still ate - his meal. Dan had been having the meals served in the children\u2019s wing, enjoying the dinosaur chicken nuggets more than the regular ones.</p><p>One of the kitchen staff had accidentally left some food in the oven a little too long, causing the smoke alarms to go off. Being the hospital that they were, sprinklers were everywhere, meaning as soon as the alarms went off, every patient was being sprayed with water.</p><p>At first, there had been no reaction, just everyone looking to the nurses to help them go where they needed to go. Though once about half the people had left the room and the other half were thoroughly drenched, Dan\u2019s screams kicked in. He was laying on the ground, twitching and shuddering and screaming the most terrible screams Lela had ever heard.</p><p>Everyone was panicked from the fire and the screams, causing all-out chaos in the psychiatric ward. One of the younger adults had ran into the kitchen, the fire triggering him to relapse and need to feel the burn. Another, more older lady, collapsed and was wheeled to the emergency ward, where it was discovered she\u2019d suffered cardiac arrest as a result of a panic attack, her aged heart not being able to pump blood fast enough.</p><p>Eric and Kate had handled the situation pretty well, considering the kitchen was on fire and their friend was screaming on the ground looking like he was having a seizure. Lela and the other doctors were all in the room, watching for their patients to make sure they made it out safely and didn\u2019t have any relapses.</p><p>Lela was only concerned with Dan, even though she did have other patients who lived in the hospital. The other two in-patients she worked with were both well on their way to recovery and Lela had no doubt they\u2019d be able to handle the situation properly. Dan, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She ran up to him, slamming her knees into the tiled floor as she climbed onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cDan? Dan can you hear me?\u201d she tried, getting absolutely no response. \u201cDan! I need you to wake up now, you\u2019ll feel really light and on the count of three, you\u2019ll be fully awake. Okay? One, two, three.\u201d</p><p>Dan lay still, the shaking stopping. He didn\u2019t open his eyes though and a minute after he\u2019d stilled, the convulsing picked up worse than it was before. Between the screams, Dan was begging for it to stop. Lela had no idea what to do, the bring him from hypnosis hadn\u2019t worked, not that Dan was under at the moment. She signaled a nurse over, knowing there was no other option but to sedate him. She felt she did this a lot, and she really did, but sometimes there was no other option. Like now, if she left Dan to himself, who knew what kind of damage - physical or mental - it could cause. No, sedating Dan, while seeming horrible, was best for him.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>Louise packed her small handbag and climbed into the car, turning the ignition as she adjusted the rear-view mirror. She was heading towards HM Wandsworth Penitentiary, the prison where Phil was being kept. It had been two weeks since the end of the trial and Phil\u2019s parents had visited him in the first week. They had said she could visit along with another friend the next week, knowing Phil would want to see his friends again. Pj was meeting her there, each living on opposite sides of the prison.</p><p>\u201cHi love,\u201d she said, pulling Pj into a hug.</p><p>\u201cHey Lou,\u201d Pj replied. They turned towards the prison, sparing a glance with each other before they began walking towards the big sign that read \u2018visitation\u2019. \u201cHow do you think he\u2019s going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d Louise replied. \u201cI\u2019d like to say he\u2019s perfectly fine but you and I both know Phil is too soft for prison. I\u2019m worried he will have become a punching bag by this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that,\u201d Pj scolded, holding the door open for Louise to enter the cool building.</p><p>\u201cWho are you here to see?\u201d a guard asked, holding his hand out before they could walk through to the area where Phil would be waiting.</p><p>\u201cPhil, Philip Lester,\u201d Pj answered, his friend\u2019s full name sounding strange on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAh, Lester. He\u2019s in there,\u201d the man said, stepping aside and gesturing to the room behind him.</p><p>\u201cLou!\u201d a voice shouted, causing her to look towards the sound, seeing a fully grown man, with tears in his eyes, running towards her. \u201cPeej! God am I glad to see you.\u201d After hugging them both tight, he led them to the table he\u2019d been allocated and took a seat.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might have not come,\u201d Phil said, looking down. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt Dan, I swear. I never wanted any of-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d he was cut of by Louise, her hand going to rest atop his. \u201cWe know you\u2019re innocent. You don\u2019t need to explain yourself to us. We know you love Dan, don\u2019t worry, love,\u201d she said, giving him a hopefully comforting smile.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Phil asked. He felt like he was saying that a lot, but it couldn\u2019t be anywhere near as much as he was thinking it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him, Phil. How are you holding up?\u201d Pj suddenly said, sending a wary glance in Louise\u2019s view.</p><p>Phil furrowed his brows. He didn\u2019t like how his friends were just brushing off his question. Had something happened? At least when his parents had told him he was good he\u2019d got an answer. He\u2019d known it was a lie but at least they\u2019d tried.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I need to know how he is,\u201d Phil tried, desperate to know how his boyfriend was.</p><p>Pj sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s scared, Phil. He\u2019s so scared and the doctors don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Recently he started screaming when water came near him and it\u2019s not like that\u2019s something he can avoid forever, he needs to drink it for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Louise put her hand on his shoulder, calming him. \u201cI know you weren\u2019t there and didn\u2019t have anything to do with it, but do you have any ideas why Dan would be scared of water?\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cReady for some fun?\u201d Sir asked, grinning as he brandished a taser and the familiar blade Phil had been using on Dan\u2019s skin for the past couple of days.</p><p>\u201cPlease just let us go,\u201d Phil tried, knowing it was pointless. It was basically routine at this point. Beg Sir to let them go, eat whatever drugged food Phil was being made to have that day, then carve the words into Dan and wait for him to pass out from blood loss. It always ended then, Sir didn\u2019t seem to see the point in carving the words if Dan wasn\u2019t conscious for the pain.</p><p>Today was different from those days though; a taser had never been involved before and Phil felt sick just thinking about what could happen with it.</p><p>They went through the unfortunately usual routine. Phil ate, slowly lost control of his limbs, and then was dragged over to Dan\u2019s limp body.</p><p>\u201cHi love, you\u2019re a good boy, remember that for me, can you?\u201d Dan sobbed and shook, nodding despite himself.</p><p>The new word began to form itself into Dan\u2019s perfect light brown skin. The \u2018o\u2019s hurt the most. After the words \u2018good fuck\u2019 were finished being carved, Sir moved Phil\u2019s hand back over the circles. He placed the blade in Phil\u2019s hand at the top and slowly started cutting down as if he were cutting some meat for dinner. The bright red of the muscle under Dan\u2019s skin was clearly sore, blood dripping from it as his stomach convulsed, the muscle abused and unused to the torture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with this part,\u201d Sir laughed, picking up two squares from the bed and putting them over the two open bits of skin. At first, Phil was confused, thinking they were bandaids, until he realised he was very, very wrong. Little wires hooked up to the pads, making Dan look similar to how he had when he\u2019d first arrived at the hospital after being rescued.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d Sir said, dropping a device into Phil\u2019s lap and causing the cords to tug on Dan\u2019s tender stomach.</p><p>\u201cNow Danny, I want you to beg. Remember how much you enjoyed this last time, princess? It\u2019ll be even better this time, I promise.\u201d The words \u2018last time\u2019 rung in Phil\u2019s ears as Dan instantly began mumbling pleas. Phil didn\u2019t think he was really aware of what he was begging for, just wanting to please Sir to maybe lessen the pain.</p><p>\u201cWell, Phil? Who are you to deny Danny what he wants?\u201d Phil glowered as Sir leant over him, pressing his thumb to the dial to turn it up to its second highest setting. When Phil didn\u2019t move his thumb, which he was slowly gaining control of again, Sir verbally growled. He pressed the dial up to the highest setting and pressed Phil\u2019s thumb into the button. Dan\u2019s screams rung so loud Phil was surprised that no neighbors came to check on them. The screaming didn\u2019t stop for a minute, even after the stimulus stopped. \u201cSuck a fucking wimp,\u201d Sir chuckled, picking up the blade again to quickly carve \u2018wimp\u2019 into his skin.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cElectrocution,\u201d Phil said suddenly. Pj and Louise exchanged looks, ones that said \u2018are we sure he\u2019s innocent if he answered so quickly and confidently?\u2019 \u201cIt happened at our flat. There wasn\u2019t any water but I\u2019d bet they\u2019d done it at the cabin with water,\u201d he explained, sad his friends actually thought he could be guilty.</p><p>They nodded, promising to share the information with Lela. Pj asked again how Phil was and he answered with his usual response - \u201cI\u2019m as good as I can be\u201d - and they spoke for maybe half an hour longer before Louise had to get going to pick up Darcy from school. Pj said he\u2019d better get going at the same time and Phil couldn\u2019t help but think it was because he didn\u2019t want to be in Phil\u2019s presence any longer. He knew it was mad, and that they were his friends, but his mind didn\u2019t like to listen to reason so it thought what it wanted.</p><p>Phil hugged them goodbye before heading back to his cell. Boston was getting out at the end of the week, having cleared his parole and been given early release with a good behaviour bond. Phil was sad to see him go, the man being the only \u201cfriend\u201d he had in the prison. He wasn\u2019t rude, kind enough to give him some advice when Phil clearly had no idea how to act in prison. He watched as Boston was lead from the cell, no cuffs on his wrists but two guards following him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until three days after Boston left that Phil realised exactly what that meant. He now had a private cell, it was only a matter of time until he got a new roommate.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lester. Long time, no see,\u201d a voice chided, causing Phil to look up into the eyes of the one and only Roger Kide.</p>",

Had something happened? At least when his parents had told him he was good he\u2019d got an answer. He\u2019d known it was a lie but at least they\u2019d tried.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I need to know how he is,\u201d Phil tried, desperate to know how his boyfriend was.</p><p>Pj sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s scared, Phil. He\u2019s so scared and the doctors don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Recently he started screaming when water came near him and it\u2019s not like that\u2019s something he can avoid forever, he needs to drink it for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Louise put her hand on his shoulder, calming him. \u201cI know you weren\u2019t there and didn\u2019t have anything to do with it, but do you have any ideas why Dan would be scared of water?\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cReady for some fun?\u201d Sir asked, grinning as he brandished a taser and the familiar blade Phil had been using on Dan\u2019s skin for the past couple of days.</p><p>\u201cPlease just let us go,\u201d Phil tried, knowing it was pointless. It was basically routine at this point. Beg Sir to let them go, eat whatever drugged food Phil was being made to have that day, then carve the words into Dan and wait for him to pass out from blood loss. It always ended then, Sir didn\u2019t seem to see the point in carving the words if Dan wasn\u2019t conscious for the pain.</p><p>Today was different from those days though; a taser had never been involved before and Phil felt sick just thinking about what could happen with it.</p><p>They went through the unfortunately usual routine. Phil ate, slowly lost control of his limbs, and then was dragged over to Dan\u2019s limp body.</p><p>\u201cHi love, you\u2019re a good boy, remember that for me, can you?\u201d Dan sobbed and shook, nodding despite himself.</p><p>The new word began to form itself into Dan\u2019s perfect light brown skin. The \u2018o\u2019s hurt the most. After the words \u2018good fuck\u2019 were finished being carved, Sir moved Phil\u2019s hand back over the circles. He placed the blade in Phil\u2019s hand at the top and slowly started cutting down as if he were cutting some meat for dinner. The bright red of the muscle under Dan\u2019s skin was clearly sore, blood dripping from it as his stomach convulsed, the muscle abused and unused to the torture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with this part,\u201d Sir laughed, picking up two squares from the bed and putting them over the two open bits of skin. At first, Phil was confused, thinking they were bandaids, until he realised he was very, very wrong. Little wires hooked up to the pads, making Dan look similar to how he had when he\u2019d first arrived at the hospital after being rescued.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d Sir said, dropping a device into Phil\u2019s lap and causing the cords to tug on Dan\u2019s tender stomach.</p><p>\u201cNow Danny, I want you to beg. Remember how much you enjoyed this last time, princess? It\u2019ll be even better this time, I promise.\u201d The words \u2018last time\u2019 rung in Phil\u2019s ears as Dan instantly began mumbling pleas. Phil didn\u2019t think he was really aware of what he was begging for, just wanting to please Sir to maybe lessen the pain.</p><p>\u201cWell, Phil? Who are you to deny Danny what he wants?\u201d Phil glowered as Sir leant over him, pressing his thumb to the dial to turn it up to its second highest setting. When Phil didn\u2019t move his thumb, which he was slowly gaining control of again, Sir verbally growled. He pressed the dial up to the highest setting and pressed Phil\u2019s thumb into the button. Dan\u2019s screams rung so loud Phil was surprised that no neighbors came to check on them. The screaming didn\u2019t stop for a minute, even after the stimulus stopped. \u201cSuck a fucking wimp,\u201d Sir chuckled, picking up the blade again to quickly carve \u2018wimp\u2019 into his skin.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cElectrocution,\u201d Phil said suddenly. Pj and Louise exchanged looks, ones that said \u2018are we sure he\u2019s innocent if he answered so quickly and confidently?\u2019 \u201cIt happened at our flat. There wasn\u2019t any water but I\u2019d bet they\u2019d done it at the cabin with water,\u201d he explained, sad his friends actually thought he could be guilty.</p><p>They nodded, promising to share the information with Lela. Pj asked again how Phil was and he answered with his usual response - \u201cI\u2019m as good as I can be\u201d - and they spoke for maybe half an hour longer before Louise had to get going to pick up Darcy from school. Pj said he\u2019d better get going at the same time and Phil couldn\u2019t help but think it was because he didn\u2019t want to be in Phil\u2019s presence any longer. He knew it was mad, and that they were his friends, but his mind didn\u2019t like to listen to reason so it thought what it wanted.</p><p>Phil hugged them goodbye before heading back to his cell. Boston was getting out at the end of the week, having cleared his parole and been given early release with a good behaviour bond. Phil was sad to see him go, the man being the only \u201cfriend\u201d he had in the prison. He wasn\u2019t rude, kind enough to give him some advice when Phil clearly had no idea how to act in prison. He watched as Boston was lead from the cell, no cuffs on his wrists but two guards following him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until three days after Boston left that Phil realised exactly what that meant. He now had a private cell, it was only a matter of time until he got a new roommate.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lester. Long time, no see,\u201d a voice chided, causing Phil to look up into the eyes of the one and only Roger Kide.</p>",

Dan spoke to Lela, Eric, and Kate but it was always in a quiet, afraid voice. Lela was used to the emotional rollercoaster that was Dan when he was regressed but now he seemed rather stoic.</p><p>There had only been one incident since his slip, which was nearly a week ago now. He&rsquo;d been in the canteen, eating dinner with Kate and Eric. Kate was wolfing down her food, clearly hungry, while Eric picked at - but still ate - his meal. Dan had been having the meals served in the children&rsquo;s wing, enjoying the dinosaur chicken nuggets more than the regular ones.</p><p>One of the kitchen staff had accidentally left some food in the oven a little too long, causing the smoke alarms to go off. Being the hospital that they were, sprinklers were everywhere, meaning as soon as the alarms went off, every patient was being sprayed with water.</p><p>At first, there had been no reaction, just everyone looking to the nurses to help them go where they needed to go. Though once about half the people had left the room and the other half were thoroughly drenched, Dan&rsquo;s screams kicked in. He was laying on the ground, twitching and shuddering and screaming the most terrible screams Lela had ever heard.</p><p>Everyone was panicked from the fire and the screams, causing all-out chaos in the psychiatric ward. One of the younger adults had ran into the kitchen, the fire triggering him to relapse and need to feel the burn. Another, more older lady, collapsed and was wheeled to the emergency ward, where it was discovered she&rsquo;d suffered cardiac arrest as a result of a panic attack, her aged heart not being able to pump blood fast enough.</p><p>Eric and Kate had handled the situation pretty well, considering the kitchen was on fire and their friend was screaming on the ground looking like he was having a seizure. Lela and the other doctors were all in the room, watching for their patients to make sure they made it out safely and didn&rsquo;t have any relapses.</p><p>Lela was only concerned with Dan, even though she did have other patients who lived in the hospital. The other two in-patients she worked with were both well on their way to recovery and Lela had no doubt they&rsquo;d be able to handle the situation properly. Dan, on the other hand, couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>She ran up to him, slamming her knees into the tiled floor as she climbed onto the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan? Dan can you hear me?&rdquo; she tried, getting absolutely no response. &ldquo;Dan! I need you to wake up now, you&rsquo;ll feel really light and on the count of three, you&rsquo;ll be fully awake. Okay? One, two, three.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan lay still, the shaking stopping. He didn&rsquo;t open his eyes though and a minute after he&rsquo;d stilled, the convulsing picked up worse than it was before. Between the screams, Dan was begging for it to stop. Lela had no idea what to do, the bring him from hypnosis hadn&rsquo;t worked, not that Dan was under at the moment. She signaled a nurse over, knowing there was no other option but to sedate him. She felt she did this a lot, and she really did, but sometimes there was no other option. Like now, if she left Dan to himself, who knew what kind of damage - physical or mental - it could cause. No, sedating Dan, while seeming horrible, was best for him.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>Louise packed her small handbag and climbed into the car, turning the ignition as she adjusted the rear-view mirror. She was heading towards HM Wandsworth Penitentiary, the prison where Phil was being kept. It had been two weeks since the end of the trial and Phil&rsquo;s parents had visited him in the first week. They had said she could visit along with another friend the next week, knowing Phil would want to see his friends again. Pj was meeting her there, each living on opposite sides of the prison.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi love,&rdquo; she said, pulling Pj into a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Lou,&rdquo; Pj replied. They turned towards the prison, sparing a glance with each other before they began walking towards the big sign that read &lsquo;visitation&rsquo;. &ldquo;How do you think he&rsquo;s going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Louise replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say he&rsquo;s perfectly fine but you and I both know Phil is too soft for prison. I&rsquo;m worried he will have become a punching bag by this point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think like that,&rdquo; Pj scolded, holding the door open for Louise to enter the cool building.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you here to see?&rdquo; a guard asked, holding his hand out before they could walk through to the area where Phil would be waiting.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, Philip Lester,&rdquo; Pj answered, his friend&rsquo;s full name sounding strange on his tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Lester. He&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; the man said, stepping aside and gesturing to the room behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Lou!&rdquo; a voice shouted, causing her to look towards the sound, seeing a fully grown man, with tears in his eyes, running towards her. &ldquo;Peej! God am I glad to see you.&rdquo; After hugging them both tight, he led them to the table he&rsquo;d been allocated and took a seat.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you might have not come,&rdquo; Phil said, looking down. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hurt Dan, I swear. I never wanted any of-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; he was cut of by Louise, her hand going to rest atop his. &ldquo;We know you&rsquo;re innocent. You don&rsquo;t need to explain yourself to us. We know you love Dan, don&rsquo;t worry, love,&rdquo; she said, giving him a hopefully comforting smile.</p><p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; Phil asked. He felt like he was saying that a lot, but it couldn&rsquo;t be anywhere near as much as he was thinking it.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about him, Phil. How are you holding up?&rdquo; Pj suddenly said, sending a wary glance in Louise&rsquo;s view.</p><p>Phil furrowed his brows. He didn&rsquo;t like how his friends were just brushing off his question.

I\u2019m home! - Dan called right after the door shut behind him and a soft click told him that it had locked too.</p><p>From where he was sat cross-legged on the floor in the living room, Phil looked up with a lazy smile. - Dan! In the living room! - he called back, knowing Dan would come to him.</p><p>Dan came to Phil with a bag with fresh food, stopping a couple of feet away from Phil.</p><p>- Oh, baby. Why are you drinking again, huh? - Dan put the bag down in Phil\u2019s lap, taking away his almost empty vodka bottle.</p><p>Phil shrugged, starting to fiddle with the bag now that his hands were empty. - I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember, I think it was something to do with you but\u2026 - he trailed off, confused at himself.</p><p>- Come here, baby. - Dan pulled Phil up, holding a hand around his waist. - You\u2019re so skinny! Haven\u2019t you eaten properly? -</p><p>Phil leaned into Dan\u2019s warmth, shrugging, more concerned with Dan than himself. - I\u2019m still alive so I guess so? -</p><p>- We need you to eat something. I got a bag full of your favourite foods, - Dan murmured against Phil\u2019s hair, leading him to the kitchen.</p><p>Still carrying the bag Dan had given him, Phil put it on the table and waited, watching Dan. - You really didn\u2019t have to, I\u2019m not that hungry\u2026 - he mumbled eventually.</p><p>- Enough! - Dan cut Phil off in a slightly stricter tone, softening once again right away, cupping Phil\u2019s face in his hands. - You need to eat properly, love. For me, please? -</p><p>Phil sighed but nodded slowly, lifting his own hand and putting it over Dan\u2019s with a smile. - Okay, okay, I will. What\u2019s first then? -</p><p>- Hot soup to warm you up and then some puffy pancakes with fruits. Plus, I got us Ribena too! - Dan murmured against Phil\u2019s skin, pecking his jawline, slowly letting go of Phil and starting to make food for him.</p><p>- Thank you, - Phil whispered, not minding if Dan heard or not, helping to get the stuff set up so Dan wasn\u2019t doing all the work for him.</p><p>Dan was singing softly while cooking, making the unsettling feeling within Phil fully disappear, flashing soft smiles at Phil time from time.</p><p>Phil did try to help at first but he was still a little out of it from the vodka so he settled with leaning on the counter and smiling back at Dan, sighing as the smell of warm food filled the room.</p><p>Dan smiled, bringing his dimples out, sitting down in front of Phil, helping Phil eat, making sure that Phil ate everything.</p><p>- My beautiful sunshine. I\u2019m so proud of you. - Dan leaned closer to Phil, whispering in his ear, - Just remember to eat properly later too. -</p><p>Phil hummed, smiling a little wider as he found and gently squeezed Dan\u2019s hand. - It\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll have you to remind me, won\u2019t I? -</p><p>- Sure. Just try to remember by yourself first. - Dan smiled, getting up, leading Phil somewhere.</p><p>Nodding again, Phil just followed Dan, already feeling a little better. - Now what? - he asked.</p><p>- A warm shower. - Dan flashed a smile to Phil before opening the bathroom door.</p><p>But Phil stopped, shaking his head. - Do we really have to? I\u2019m already warm from the soup\u2026 - he complained.</p><p>- Phil, when was the last time you showered, hm? - Dan let his hands rest on his hips.</p><p>- Um. - Phil frowned, his memory a little hazy. - What day is it again? -</p><p>- See, you can\u2019t remember. That just means that you need that shower. - Dan pulled Phil closer by his hips.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t exactly hug Dan but he did rest his head on Dan\u2019s shoulder, breathing in the scent of his cologne before sighing. - You\u2019ll stay with me though, right? -</p><p>- Always, - Dan breathed out, looking deep into Phil\u2019s eyes, sliding fingers over his cheek.</p><p>- Mhm, I love you, - Phil mumbled, finally putting an arm around Dan in return, lost in the sincerity in his eyes.</p><p>Dan smiled, undressing Phil, softly pushing him under the shower.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t really pay much attention to what was happening, just focused on staring at Dan, at his soft smile and his cute dimples - dimples that Phil eventually reached up and poked, of course.</p><p>Dan giggled in return, pulling Phil into a soft, puffy towel, drying him off.</p><p>- Are we done? - Phil asked, his voice a little quieter than usual now.</p><p>- Yes, - Dan breathed out, - time to put you to bed, these dark circles don\u2019t suit you. -</p><p>- I don\u2019t need sleep, I\u2019m fine, can\u2019t we do something else? - Phil asked, trying his best to pout.</p><p>- Baby, you haven\u2019t slept almost at all. And I thought you liked cuddling? - Dan tilted his head to the side.</p><p>Phil looked like he wanted to just stamp his foot in frustration. Instead, he just nodded in defeat. - Yeah, of course, I do\u2026 -</p><p>- Then let\u2019s go to bed. - Dan put the wet towel down, leading Phil to the big bed. - Do you want to put on my shirt? Or will you sleep fully naked? -</p><p>Giggling, Phil shook his head a little, frowning as a stray droplet of water flew off his hair. - Can I have your shirt, please? -</p><p>- Of course. - Dan smiled, pulling off the shirt he was wearing and giving it to Phil, helping Phil get it on. - You are so beautiful. You always take my breath away. -</p><p>Hearing the words \u201cbreath away\u201d, something moved inside Phil, letting unknown darkness start to seep into his bones, but he just couldn\u2019t put his finger on what it was and why it happened.</p><p>Once he\u2019d smoothened the shirt out, Phil didn\u2019t hesitate before softly kissing Dan, pulling away before Dan could do anything and murmuring: - You can keep your breath, you\u2019ll need it to kiss me later. -</p><p>Dan laughed, shaking his head and softly pushing Phil to the bed.</p><p>- Even when I can\u2019t deny that that butt of yours is very sexy and calling right now, you need some good sleep as soon as possible. - Dan climbed into bed himself, already being in just boxers, letting Phil wonder when he had pulled his jeans off.</p><p>Phil just hummed, shuffling closer to Dan with a reluctant experession on his face. - I don\u2019t need sleep, but you did promise cuddles\u2026? - he asked hopefully.</p><p>- Yes, you know that I love them! - Dan smiled, opening his arms for Phil to get closer.</p><p>And Phil did, wrapping an arm around Dan and sliding even closer to him, resting his head on Dan\u2019s chest, trying to find his heartbeat to calm himself down.</p><p>But there was silence, and with every second it went on, the weird dark feeling got stronger and stronger for Phil.</p><p>For some reason, he couldn\u2019t quite figure out what it was. It was as if something had changed but nobody had told Phil, something was missing and he couldn\u2019t pinpoint it. Eventually, he looked up at Dan, frowning. - Dan, something\u2019s wrong, - he mumbled.</p><p>- Everything is fine, angel, you need to calm down. - Dan smiled sadly, pulling Phil back down but never losing eye contact with him.</p><p>- I don\u2019t get it\u2026 - Phil mumbled mostly to himself, pulling Dan closer, needing his security, but even that wasn\u2019t fully helping to tame the darkness of his confusion.</p><p>- Everything will get better, believe me, - Dan murmured, starting to play with Phil\u2019s hair.</p><p>Phil was suddenly on high alert. - Get better? What do you mean, is something wrong? - he asked quickly, looking back at Dan.</p><p>- Not anymore. Come, sleep. You need to get some sleep, baby. - Dan let his fingers slide over Phil\u2019s cheek, making Phil\u2019s eyelids droop, and when they opened again, Dan looked so much paler, his lips a bit blue-ish, his eyes looking dark with dark circles under.</p><p>Startled, Phil lifted a hand to cup Dan\u2019s face and found that his usually too-warm skin was cold and stiff, as if he was barely alive. Even his eyes looked less brown and more dull, less like Dan. - What\u2019s happening? - Phil asked quietly, not sure if he was talking to himself or Dan.</p><p>- It\u2019s alright. You just need to get some good sleep. - Dan pulled Phil back closer, pushing his hair out of Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Phil just shook his head again, his head already hurting from being so shocked, taking deep breaths. - No, no, you look better when I\u2019m more awake. -</p><p>- You will sleep a bit and then it will be alright. - Dan leaned down, softly kissing Phil.</p><p>The kiss acted as a breeze opening the gates, memories rushing to Phil, the soft kiss before Dan said an even softer \u201cI love you\u201d and walked out the door, and the call that made Phil\u2019s blood freeze, after that him walking numbly into the cold room, seeing him there, with dried blood all over his hair, ruining his soft curls, sunkissed skin now pale, his brown eyes closed, the soft lips still with blood tinting them just a bit more alive, he was there, he was dead, part of Phil\u2019s soul taken away. It all rushed back to Phil, realization hitting him hard.</p><p>Phil gasped silently, his grip on Dan tightening but the warmth he\u2019d been getting from Dan\u2019s touch fading, fading away because now he knew what he\u2019d been missing and he couldn\u2019t undo that realisation. But he tried, imagining Dan as best as he could when he was alive and well, pushing everything else out of his mind, wanting to go back to when they could really do this.</p><p>Dan placed a soft kiss on Phil\u2019s eyelids, the kiss actually being warm and soft, feeling so real.</p><p>Phil sighed, his eyes closing for a moment but then snapping back open as he looked at Dan. - You won\u2019t be here in the morning, will you? - he asked sadly, already knowing the answer.</p><p>- Why such a question? - Dan furrowed his brows, tilting his head to the side.</p><p>- Because I know that, in the morning, after waking up, you won\u2019t be here and I will be all alone yet again. And I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t lose you once again, - Phil cried out, Dan pulling him into a soft hug.</p><p>- It\u2019s alright, angel. I will always be by your side, I will always be with you. And you know it. I love you, Phil. Now sleep, baby. - Dan let his lips rest softly against Phil\u2019s, carrying him to sleep with no pain.</p><hr><p><i>like / reblog but don\u2019t repost, thanks!</i></p>",

In the living room! - he called back, knowing Dan would come to him.</p><p>Dan came to Phil with a bag with fresh food, stopping a couple of feet away from Phil.</p><p>- Oh, baby. Why are you drinking again, huh? - Dan put the bag down in Phil\u2019s lap, taking away his almost empty vodka bottle.</p><p>Phil shrugged, starting to fiddle with the bag now that his hands were empty. - I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember, I think it was something to do with you but\u2026 - he trailed off, confused at himself.</p><p>- Come here, baby. - Dan pulled Phil up, holding a hand around his waist. - You\u2019re so skinny!

Plus, I got us Ribena too! - Dan murmured against Phil\u2019s skin, pecking his jawline, slowly letting go of Phil and starting to make food for him.</p><p>- Thank you, - Phil whispered, not minding if Dan heard or not, helping to get the stuff set up so Dan wasn\u2019t doing all the work for him.</p><p>Dan was singing softly while cooking, making the unsettling feeling within Phil fully disappear, flashing soft smiles at Phil time from time.</p><p>Phil did try to help at first but he was still a little out of it from the vodka so he settled with leaning on the counter and smiling back at Dan, sighing as the smell of warm food filled the room.</p><p>Dan smiled, bringing his dimples out, sitting down in front of Phil, helping Phil eat, making sure that Phil ate everything.</p><p>- My beautiful sunshine. I\u2019m so proud of you. - Dan leaned closer to Phil, whispering in his ear, - Just remember to eat properly later too. -</p><p>Phil hummed, smiling a little wider as he found and gently squeezed Dan\u2019s hand. - It\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll have you to remind me, won\u2019t I? -</p><p>- Sure. Just try to remember by yourself first. - Dan smiled, getting up, leading Phil somewhere.</p><p>Nodding again, Phil just followed Dan, already feeling a little better. - Now what? - he asked.</p><p>- A warm shower. - Dan flashed a smile to Phil before opening the bathroom door.</p><p>But Phil stopped, shaking his head. - Do we really have to? I\u2019m already warm from the soup\u2026 - he complained.</p><p>- Phil, when was the last time you showered, hm? - Dan let his hands rest on his hips.</p><p>- Um. - Phil frowned, his memory a little hazy. - What day is it again? -</p><p>- See, you can\u2019t remember. That just means that you need that shower. - Dan pulled Phil closer by his hips.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t exactly hug Dan but he did rest his head on Dan\u2019s shoulder, breathing in the scent of his cologne before sighing. - You\u2019ll stay with me though, right? -</p><p>- Always, - Dan breathed out, looking deep into Phil\u2019s eyes, sliding fingers over his cheek.</p><p>- Mhm, I love you, - Phil mumbled, finally putting an arm around Dan in return, lost in the sincerity in his eyes.</p><p>Dan smiled, undressing Phil, softly pushing him under the shower.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t really pay much attention to what was happening, just focused on staring at Dan, at his soft smile and his cute dimples - dimples that Phil eventually reached up and poked, of course.</p><p>Dan giggled in return, pulling Phil into a soft, puffy towel, drying him off.</p><p>- Are we done? - Phil asked, his voice a little quieter than usual now.</p><p>- Yes, - Dan breathed out, - time to put you to bed, these dark circles don\u2019t suit you. -</p><p>- I don\u2019t need sleep, I\u2019m fine, can\u2019t we do something else? - Phil asked, trying his best to pout.</p><p>- Baby, you haven\u2019t slept almost at all. And I thought you liked cuddling? - Dan tilted his head to the side.</p><p>Phil looked like he wanted to just stamp his foot in frustration. Instead, he just nodded in defeat. - Yeah, of course, I do\u2026 -</p><p>- Then let\u2019s go to bed. - Dan put the wet towel down, leading Phil to the big bed. - Do you want to put on my shirt? Or will you sleep fully naked? -</p><p>Giggling, Phil shook his head a little, frowning as a stray droplet of water flew off his hair. - Can I have your shirt, please? -</p><p>- Of course. - Dan smiled, pulling off the shirt he was wearing and giving it to Phil, helping Phil get it on. - You are so beautiful. You always take my breath away. -</p><p>Hearing the words \u201cbreath away\u201d, something moved inside Phil, letting unknown darkness start to seep into his bones, but he just couldn\u2019t put his finger on what it was and why it happened.</p><p>Once he\u2019d smoothened the shirt out, Phil didn\u2019t hesitate before softly kissing Dan, pulling away before Dan could do anything and murmuring: - You can keep your breath, you\u2019ll need it to kiss me later. -</p><p>Dan laughed, shaking his head and softly pushing Phil to the bed.</p><p>- Even when I can\u2019t deny that that butt of yours is very sexy and calling right now, you need some good sleep as soon as possible. - Dan climbed into bed himself, already being in just boxers, letting Phil wonder when he had pulled his jeans off.</p><p>Phil just hummed, shuffling closer to Dan with a reluctant experession on his face. - I don\u2019t need sleep, but you did promise cuddles\u2026? - he asked hopefully.</p><p>- Yes, you know that I love them! - Dan smiled, opening his arms for Phil to get closer.</p><p>And Phil did, wrapping an arm around Dan and sliding even closer to him, resting his head on Dan\u2019s chest, trying to find his heartbeat to calm himself down.</p><p>But there was silence, and with every second it went on, the weird dark feeling got stronger and stronger for Phil.</p><p>For some reason, he couldn\u2019t quite figure out what it was. It was as if something had changed but nobody had told Phil, something was missing and he couldn\u2019t pinpoint it. Eventually, he looked up at Dan, frowning. - Dan, something\u2019s wrong, - he mumbled.</p><p>- Everything is fine, angel, you need to calm down. - Dan smiled sadly, pulling Phil back down but never losing eye contact with him.</p><p>- I don\u2019t get it\u2026 - Phil mumbled mostly to himself, pulling Dan closer, needing his security, but even that wasn\u2019t fully helping to tame the darkness of his confusion.</p><p>- Everything will get better, believe me, - Dan murmured, starting to play with Phil\u2019s hair.</p><p>Phil was suddenly on high alert. - Get better? What do you mean, is something wrong? - he asked quickly, looking back at Dan.</p><p>- Not anymore. Come, sleep. You need to get some sleep, baby. - Dan let his fingers slide over Phil\u2019s cheek, making Phil\u2019s eyelids droop, and when they opened again, Dan looked so much paler, his lips a bit blue-ish, his eyes looking dark with dark circles under.</p><p>Startled, Phil lifted a hand to cup Dan\u2019s face and found that his usually too-warm skin was cold and stiff, as if he was barely alive. Even his eyes looked less brown and more dull, less like Dan. - What\u2019s happening? - Phil asked quietly, not sure if he was talking to himself or Dan.</p><p>- It\u2019s alright. You just need to get some good sleep. - Dan pulled Phil back closer, pushing his hair out of Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Phil just shook his head again, his head already hurting from being so shocked, taking deep breaths. - No, no, you look better when I\u2019m more awake. -</p><p>- You will sleep a bit and then it will be alright. - Dan leaned down, softly kissing Phil.</p><p>The kiss acted as a breeze opening the gates, memories rushing to Phil, the soft kiss before Dan said an even softer \u201cI love you\u201d and walked out the door, and the call that made Phil\u2019s blood freeze, after that him walking numbly into the cold room, seeing him there, with dried blood all over his hair, ruining his soft curls, sunkissed skin now pale, his brown eyes closed, the soft lips still with blood tinting them just a bit more alive, he was there, he was dead, part of Phil\u2019s soul taken away. It all rushed back to Phil, realization hitting him hard.</p><p>Phil gasped silently, his grip on Dan tightening but the warmth he\u2019d been getting from Dan\u2019s touch fading, fading away because now he knew what he\u2019d been missing and he couldn\u2019t undo that realisation. But he tried, imagining Dan as best as he could when he was alive and well, pushing everything else out of his mind, wanting to go back to when they could really do this.</p><p>Dan placed a soft kiss on Phil\u2019s eyelids, the kiss actually being warm and soft, feeling so real.</p><p>Phil sighed, his eyes closing for a moment but then snapping back open as he looked at Dan. - You won\u2019t be here in the morning, will you? - he asked sadly, already knowing the answer.</p><p>- Why such a question? - Dan furrowed his brows, tilting his head to the side.</p><p>- Because I know that, in the morning, after waking up, you won\u2019t be here and I will be all alone yet again. And I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t lose you once again, - Phil cried out, Dan pulling him into a soft hug.</p><p>- It\u2019s alright, angel. I will always be by your side, I will always be with you. And you know it. I love you, Phil. Now sleep, baby. - Dan let his lips rest softly against Phil\u2019s, carrying him to sleep with no pain.</p><hr><p><i>like / reblog but don\u2019t repost, thanks!</i></p>",

I&rsquo;m home! - Dan called right after the door shut behind him and a soft click told him that it had locked too.</p><p>From where he was sat cross-legged on the floor in the living room, Phil looked up with a lazy smile. - Dan! In the living room! - he called back, knowing Dan would come to him.</p><p>Dan came to Phil with a bag with fresh food, stopping a couple of feet away from Phil.</p><p>- Oh, baby. Why are you drinking again, huh? - Dan put the bag down in Phil&rsquo;s lap, taking away his almost empty vodka bottle.</p><p>Phil shrugged, starting to fiddle with the bag now that his hands were empty. - I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t remember, I think it was something to do with you but&hellip; - he trailed off, confused at himself.</p><p>- Come here, baby. - Dan pulled Phil up, holding a hand around his waist. - You&rsquo;re so skinny! Haven&rsquo;t you eaten properly? -</p><p>Phil leaned into Dan&rsquo;s warmth, shrugging, more concerned with Dan than himself. - I&rsquo;m still alive so I guess so? -</p><p>- We need you to eat something. I got a bag full of your favourite foods, - Dan murmured against Phil&rsquo;s hair, leading him to the kitchen.</p><p>Still carrying the bag Dan had given him, Phil put it on the table and waited, watching Dan. - You really didn&rsquo;t have to, I&rsquo;m not that hungry&hellip; - he mumbled eventually.</p><p>- Enough! - Dan cut Phil off in a slightly stricter tone, softening once again right away, cupping Phil&rsquo;s face in his hands. - You need to eat properly, love. For me, please? -</p><p>Phil sighed but nodded slowly, lifting his own hand and putting it over Dan&rsquo;s with a smile. - Okay, okay, I will.
