The dialogue makes the plot clear as day and most people (including me) entirely missed this plot when season 7 aired! </p><p>What Tyrion did was fucked up to say the least and I think the show was trying to subtly warn us about how we should be viewing the events in Jon and Dany\u2019s first meeting. First we have the scenes were they strip Jon and his men of their weapons but then they give us this scene:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/91f19715f128c56024ef11b4a6f5cf02/tumblr_pf0912vfFq1v81iri_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><h2>Jon: <b><i>She\u2019s starting to let on!</i></b> </h2><p>Y\u2019all:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"350\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d8ea9b3e040b79dd4c11f4c9d1eedfc/tumblr_pf0914OMke1v81iri_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"350\"/></figure><p>If this wasn\u2019t the biggest <i><b>Wink</b></i> <i><b>Wink </b></i>pay attention to what happens next to the audience, I don\u2019t know what is!

Don\u2019t believe me? Go rewatch that scene! </p><p>That\u2019s why Daenerys and Jon\u2019s meeting was filled with so much friction! That was the true plot that we missed in that scene and that\u2019s why we see Jon react like this in his next interaction with Tyrion: </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ac098585f40b88f5e9a0a900fe42496/tumblr_pf0916FRBd1v81iri_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p>Right off the bat, Jon gets straight to the point and tell us how he really feels about the situation he finds himself in at Dragonstone. To summarize he says \u201cI\u2019m a prisoner on this island\u201d \u201cyou took my ship\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a northern fool\u201d for coming in the first place. Tyrion never really cops to what he did but essentially he tells Jon that she should try harder and get to know Daenerys more. Then he throws Jon a \u201cDragon-glass\u201d bone to try and make up for what he did. Lol! </p><p>I say all of this to say that this was the major plot that I believe went over everyone\u2019s head in season 7! Yes, Jon willingly went to Dragonstone to seek an alliance but he did so because he didn\u2019t think his kingdom would ever be at stake because of his trust in Tyrion. Jon was never at Dragonstone under friendly terms or circumstances and he never had an equal status as King! That\u2019s why in episode 5 Jon hauled ass so fast off of that island like his life depended on it.</p><p>The circumstances of this situation to me requires political Jon and makes political Jon fair game! I absolutely believe Jon went to Dragonstone with good intentions but quickly realized that Tyrion and Dany\u2019s intentions weren\u2019t as true as his own. Hence him being metaphorically and physically trapped at Dragonstone! </p>",

A wide smile was painted on his face as he walked inside balancing a tray filled with lemon cakes on his hands.</i></p><p><i>She was sitting on her window seat with a book between her legs, her long unbound auburn hair moved slightly with the wind that slipped through the open glass, his heart stopped in his chest for a moment as an insidious feeling crept into his chest.</i></p><p><i>She was only fourteen, he shouldn\u2019t think of her as a woman yet. </i></p><p><i>He composed himself and cleared his throat before speaking \u201cJust look what I got for you sweetling\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa turned the page of her book and without sparing a glance in his direction answered \u201cI am not hungry, you can take them away\u201d</i></p><p><i>He frowned as he moved closer \u201cYou haven\u2019t even seen them-\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I can smell them\u201d She interrupted \u201cAnd I say I don\u2019t want them\u201d</i></p><p><i>The frown on his forehead widened as he placed the tray gently on her side table before moving closer to the window where she was sitting \u201cIs something wrong Sansa?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI saw you with her\u201d She muttered as she closed her book harshly and raised those devastated blue eyes in his direction \u201cI was with the Arya and the boys in the park yesterday and I saw you\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon scratched his head as he dropped himself on the opposite extreme of the seat \u201cArianne you mean?\u201d Sansa rolled her eyes and gave him a look that answered his question \u201cShe is my girlfriend Sansa, what is wrong with me being with her\u201d</i></p><p><i>The young girl huffed and crossed her arms over her chest \u201cI hear what you were telling her, you said she was the most important girl in the world for you\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon sighed remembering the moment Sansa had overheard him; truth was Arianne needed constant reminder of how awesome she was, she was also two years older than him and he was a horny boy, meaning he would say whatever she wanted in order to have sex with her. Somehow the fact that Sansa had heard him made him feel shameful.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou used to say I was the most important girl in the world\u201d His step-sister told him with teary eyes, her emotions removing the mask of indifference she had put on herself earlier \u201cWhy would you lie to me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon felt his throat clogging with emotion as he reached for her and grasped her by the shoulders \u201cI didn\u2019t lie sweet girl, there is no one more important than you\u201d</i></p><p><i>He pulled her into his chest, her warm smell overwhelmed his senses and made him want to go back in time and take back all the words he had told Arianne; a part of him knew it wasn\u2019t wrong to say what he had said, the girl was his girlfriend after all, but Sansa was his everything and he didn\u2019t want her to doubt it even for a second.</i></p><p><i>The young girl pulled away from his body and looked at him with reproachful eyes \u201cHow can I believe you?

A wide smile was painted on his face as he walked inside balancing a tray filled with lemon cakes on his hands.</i></p><p><i>She was sitting on her window seat with a book between her legs, her long unbound auburn hair moved slightly with the wind that slipped through the open glass, his heart stopped in his chest for a moment as an insidious feeling crept into his chest.</i></p><p><i>She was only fourteen, he shouldn&rsquo;t think of her as a woman yet. </i></p><p><i>He composed himself and cleared his throat before speaking &ldquo;Just look what I got for you sweetling&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sansa turned the page of her book and without sparing a glance in his direction answered &ldquo;I am not hungry, you can take them away&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He frowned as he moved closer &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t even seen them-&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But I can smell them&rdquo; She interrupted &ldquo;And I say I don&rsquo;t want them&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The frown on his forehead widened as he placed the tray gently on her side table before moving closer to the window where she was sitting &ldquo;Is something wrong Sansa?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I saw you with her&rdquo; She muttered as she closed her book harshly and raised those devastated blue eyes in his direction &ldquo;I was with the Arya and the boys in the park yesterday and I saw you&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon scratched his head as he dropped himself on the opposite extreme of the seat &ldquo;Arianne you mean?&rdquo; Sansa rolled her eyes and gave him a look that answered his question &ldquo;She is my girlfriend Sansa, what is wrong with me being with her&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The young girl huffed and crossed her arms over her chest &ldquo;I hear what you were telling her, you said she was the most important girl in the world for you&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon sighed remembering the moment Sansa had overheard him; truth was Arianne needed constant reminder of how awesome she was, she was also two years older than him and he was a horny boy, meaning he would say whatever she wanted in order to have sex with her. Somehow the fact that Sansa had heard him made him feel shameful.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You used to say I was the most important girl in the world&rdquo; His step-sister told him with teary eyes, her emotions removing the mask of indifference she had put on herself earlier &ldquo;Why would you lie to me?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon felt his throat clogging with emotion as he reached for her and grasped her by the shoulders &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lie sweet girl, there is no one more important than you&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He pulled her into his chest, her warm smell overwhelmed his senses and made him want to go back in time and take back all the words he had told Arianne; a part of him knew it wasn&rsquo;t wrong to say what he had said, the girl was his girlfriend after all, but Sansa was his everything and he didn&rsquo;t want her to doubt it even for a second.</i></p><p><i>The young girl pulled away from his body and looked at him with reproachful eyes &ldquo;How can I believe you? How can I believe anything you say now?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jon remembered how awful he had felt after that day, how he had fought to never again make his sister feel like she wasn&rsquo;t the most important thing for him and how he had destroyed everything the night he took her to bed for the first time.</p><p>His cock stirred in his boxers with the memory of that night&hellip; and the memory of last night.
