Jon models his whole life after Ned Stark. His sense of honour and duty all come from Ned. That is always going to dominate regardless of him knowing who his real father is. Despite that he is not and will never be a Stark, he&rsquo;s said this himself. Also his Targaryen traits are dormant - logically because it&rsquo;s never been explored. I think now his exposure to the dragons, his emotional connection to Dany and knowing who he really is could change that.</p>",

Sansa and Arya already know the truth about Jon. It doesn&rsquo;t change a thing between them and at the same time it does.)</p><p>* </p><p>It&rsquo;s the first time they are alone since the first night. Not that it&rsquo;s a surprise. Both have been busy with the growing tasks related to the upcoming war. If before the cohabitation between their allies already seemed complicated and required great diplomacy, with the arrival of Jaime Lannister at any time could lead to disaster.</p><p>Last time, she asked him a very specific question. He didn&rsquo;t answer, but isn&rsquo;t silence itself a sort of answer? A silent assent?</p><p>Her fingers shake and Sansa close them in a fist. There is something\u00a0in his eyes\u00a0when he looks at her. She used to think that she&rsquo;d see Father there, but she never found anyone else outside Jon. (Always Jon. Only Jon). There is a tension between them that cannot be explained. It&rsquo;s not unpleasant in and of itself, just different from anything she has ever felt. A quiver in the limbs as if she wanted to run away, a weight in the chest like the one after a long run, the desire to touch, to placate this&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Ghost?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa blinks. &ldquo;Probably in the crypts or in the godswood.&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t tell him that it is rare to see him inside the castle these days. It&rsquo;s as if the presence of the new guests annoys him. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the dragons. She doesn&rsquo;t say anything, but she sees Jon nod, as if he had come to the same conclusion. <i>What do you know? What are you thinking about?</i></p><p>Jon has his hands resting on the stone mantel. He gives her his back and Sansa watches the curve of his spine, troubled.</p><p>When he turns, she looks away quickly. The weight of Jon&rsquo;s eyes is familiar. His silence is not. Therefore when he speaks, she doesn&rsquo;t know what to feel, whether relief or rather annoyance.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>She frowns. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cersei,&rdquo; he replies with a smile that is not quite a smile, not really. The mere sight causes something to contract painfully inside her. It makes her want to cry and scream. &ldquo;You were right. We should never have trusted her. You were right,&rdquo; he says again, more forcefully. &ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p><p>Nobody makes him angry like you, Arya told her a couple of days ago. You make him furious.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the same for her. Every time, Jon surprises her and most of the time not in a positive way. He confuse her, pulls the ground out from under her feet, shakes every painfully obtained certainty.</p><p>She clenches the jaw. &ldquo;Is this what you think of me? That I am so petty as to take pleasure in something like that?&rdquo;</p><p>When she meets Jon&rsquo;s eyes, she finds the same confusion and frustration reflected there. Not for the first time with him, she is overwhelmed by her own emotions. Vulnerable. Exposed.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I think because I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo; The admission seems to irritate and exhaust him at the same time. It sounds like an accusation against her. It hurts, but Sansa is used to far worse. To being distrusted, to being underestimated and mocked. This doesn&rsquo;t make it less bitter, especially if it comes from Jon. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you want. I don&rsquo;t understand what you think.&rdquo;</p><p>He wants trust, but doesn&rsquo;t know that it should be mutual?</p><p>Sansa is about to argue harshly, but Jon&rsquo;s hunched shoulders and his stance hold her back. It&rsquo;s as if he expects the conflict, as if he <i>want</i> it.</p><p>Instead she sighs. &ldquo;What I want is exactly what you want. For our family to survive. To protect our home.&rdquo; She sees how his eyes widen. &ldquo;What I think howewer&hellip; there was no other way? To secure her help,&rdquo; she clarifies. &ldquo;You just had to give up the crown.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t respond immediately and when he does it&rsquo;s with a non-response. &ldquo;It should never have been mine,&rdquo; he says finally, weary as if every word had been torn away by force.</p><p>She knows. Of course she knows. It had to be-</p><p>&ldquo;It had to be Robb&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she hears.</p><p>Sansa inhales deeply. She might cry and so she closes her eyes, breathing and counting her heartbeats. The ghosts of loved and lost people lie between them, together with the shadows projected by the fire against the walls.</p><p>She would like to console him, but there are no words to assuage the grief that runs through her veins like poison, like wildfire.</p><p>They never really talked about Robb. Only once she mentioned him, in a moment of anger, while trying to convince him to be more cautious and learn from past mistakes. And now, now it seems she has a chasm instead of a heart.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Jon says softly. He is looking at her regretful, angry with himself. There are forbidden arguments that both prefer not to touch. The empty spaces in their hearts.</p><p>Sansa shakes her head slowly. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &ldquo;For food supplies,&rdquo; she says mildly and picks up the maps in front of her. It costs all her energy to regain control over her mind and body. &ldquo;Maybe there is a solution.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon would clearly like to add something, but in the end he gives up. He runs his hand through his hair and approaches her. Instead of occupying the chair in front of her, he stands beside her and reaches out. His body is close enough that she can feel the heat emanating, his breath against one side of her face.</p><p>&ldquo;With the stocks in our possession we can resist, but for how much? Less than a year, according to the calculations. Tyrion said that Daenerys has a fleet.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon is so close that the angry flash in his eyes doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed. It&rsquo;s only a moment before that fleeting spark is replaced by appreciation. Jon studies the route plotted on the maps and nods with approval. &ldquo;Do you already have a man in mind to send?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have two.&rdquo; She looks at him out of the corner of her eye. &ldquo;Ser Davos and Varys.&rdquo; She waits for a reaction or a comment and when both don&rsquo;t arrive, she forces herself to ask him, &ldquo;Do you approve?&rdquo;</p><p>The request seems to surprise him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need my permission. You&rsquo;re the Lady of Winterfell.&rdquo; He gently pulls the map from her hands to watch it more carefully against the light of the candle. &ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s worth, I approve.&rdquo;</p><p>It should end there. Sansa got what she wanted. Her choice wasn&rsquo;t casual. Varys, the master of whispers, who sees and knows everything. His presence in Winterfell worries her more than any dragon could ever do. There are secrets that must remain such, upon which lives depend. &ldquo;It means something to me,&rdquo; she says softly.</p><p>The bad blood and the last traces of hostility between them seem finally dispelled.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have to be so irritating?&rdquo; Jon asks, but there is no real bite in his voice. A corner of his mouth is arched in a hint of smile, a genuine one. </p><p>&ldquo;I grew up among irritating people.&rdquo; She smiles in turn, maintaining eye contact. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I&rsquo;m not <i>that</i> irritating.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles, always without averting his eyes and then his expression radically changes. It gets intense and full of light and warmth and -</p><p>Arya enters without knocking and stops after just a few steps, looking at them with an arched eyebrow. &ldquo;Did I interrupt something?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon flinches as if burned. Sansa stiffens. She takes the map he hands her and rolls it up. &ldquo;Do you agree?&rdquo; She questions without looking at him.</p><p>Jon clears his throat. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya keeps looking at them like a hawk and her silence irritates her more than would yellings and recriminations.</p><p>When Jon leaves, Arya is still staring at her with that inquisitive look that reveals nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya shrugs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just unusual to see you two get along so well.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Nobody makes him angry like you</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve smiled more since Jon came back,&rdquo; she adds without any connection.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point, Arya?&rdquo; She rolls her eyes. &ldquo;If you have a question, say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t going to be,&rdquo; she replies. &ldquo;It was a simple statement. Are you happy that he came back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be? He is our family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even thougt-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We had decided not to talk about it,&rdquo; she hisses, hushing her.</p><p>&ldquo;So is what we&rsquo;re going to do? Pretend not to know? That this doesn&rsquo;t change everything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing changes between us. You heard what Jon said. Titles doesn&rsquo;t matter. We need to focus on pressing issues, what needs to be done in order to survive.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya doesn&rsquo;t seem convinced yet. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t care?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What would you like me to say? Of course I care, but that&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t have to change anything. Jon remains Jon. He&rsquo;s a Stark. He&rsquo;s part of our family and we protect our family.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s not the first time they talk about this. Arya should know, understand why it&rsquo;s so important. At least until she gets rid of Varys, of the danger he represents. Her face is flushed and she frowns at the wolfish expression in Arya&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Why are you smiling? Are you making fun of me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a little.&rdquo;</p><p>Because of course Arya knows that she cares. <i>Of course</i>. Maybe Varys isn&rsquo;t the dangerous one after all.</p>",

If before the cohabitation between their allies already seemed complicated and required great diplomacy, with the arrival of Jaime Lannister at any time could lead to disaster.</p><p>Last time, she asked him a very specific question. He didn\u2019t answer, but isn\u2019t silence itself a sort of answer? A silent assent?</p><p>Her fingers shake and Sansa close them in a fist. There is something\u00a0in his eyes\u00a0when he looks at her. She used to think that she\u2019d see Father there, but she never found anyone else outside Jon. (Always Jon. Only Jon). There is a tension between them that cannot be explained. It\u2019s not unpleasant in and of itself, just different from anything she has ever felt. A quiver in the limbs as if she wanted to run away, a weight in the chest like the one after a long run, the desire to touch, to placate this\u2026</p><p>\u201cWhere is Ghost?\u201d</p><p>Sansa blinks. \u201cProbably in the crypts or in the godswood.\u201d She doesn\u2019t tell him that it is rare to see him inside the castle these days. It\u2019s as if the presence of the new guests annoys him. Or maybe it\u2019s the dragons. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but she sees Jon nod, as if he had come to the same conclusion. <i>What do you know? What are you thinking about?</i></p><p>Jon has his hands resting on the stone mantel. He gives her his back and Sansa watches the curve of his spine, troubled.</p><p>When he turns, she looks away quickly. The weight of Jon\u2019s eyes is familiar. His silence is not. Therefore when he speaks, she doesn\u2019t know what to feel, whether relief or rather annoyance.</p><p>\u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d He asks.</p><p>She frowns. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCersei,\u201d he replies with a smile that is not quite a smile, not really. The mere sight causes something to contract painfully inside her. It makes her want to cry and scream. \u201cYou were right. We should never have trusted her. You were right,\u201d he says again, more forcefully. \u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d</p><p>Nobody makes him angry like you, Arya told her a couple of days ago. You make him furious.</p><p>It\u2019s the same for her. Every time, Jon surprises her and most of the time not in a positive way. He confuse her, pulls the ground out from under her feet, shakes every painfully obtained certainty.</p><p>She clenches the jaw. \u201cIs this what you think of me? That I am so petty as to take pleasure in something like that?\u201d</p><p>When she meets Jon\u2019s eyes, she finds the same confusion and frustration reflected there. Not for the first time with him, she is overwhelmed by her own emotions. Vulnerable. Exposed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I think because I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d The admission seems to irritate and exhaust him at the same time. It sounds like an accusation against her. It hurts, but Sansa is used to far worse. To being distrusted, to being underestimated and mocked. This doesn\u2019t make it less bitter, especially if it comes from Jon. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want. I don\u2019t understand what you think.\u201d</p><p>He wants trust, but doesn\u2019t know that it should be mutual?</p><p>Sansa is about to argue harshly, but Jon\u2019s hunched shoulders and his stance hold her back. It\u2019s as if he expects the conflict, as if he <i>want</i> it.</p><p>Instead she sighs. \u201cWhat I want is exactly what you want. For our family to survive. To protect our home.\u201d She sees how his eyes widen. \u201cWhat I think howewer\u2026 there was no other way? To secure her help,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cYou just had to give up the crown.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond immediately and when he does it\u2019s with a non-response. \u201cIt should never have been mine,\u201d he says finally, weary as if every word had been torn away by force.</p><p>She knows. Of course she knows. It had to be-</p><p>\u201cIt had to be Robb\u2019s,\u201d she hears.</p><p>Sansa inhales deeply. She might cry and so she closes her eyes, breathing and counting her heartbeats. The ghosts of loved and lost people lie between them, together with the shadows projected by the fire against the walls.</p><p>She would like to console him, but there are no words to assuage the grief that runs through her veins like poison, like wildfire.</p><p>They never really talked about Robb. Only once she mentioned him, in a moment of anger, while trying to convince him to be more cautious and learn from past mistakes. And now, now it seems she has a chasm instead of a heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jon says softly. He is looking at her regretful, angry with himself. There are forbidden arguments that both prefer not to touch. The empty spaces in their hearts.</p><p>Sansa shakes her head slowly. It doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cFor food supplies,\u201d she says mildly and picks up the maps in front of her. It costs all her energy to regain control over her mind and body. \u201cMaybe there is a solution.\u201d</p><p>Jon would clearly like to add something, but in the end he gives up. He runs his hand through his hair and approaches her. Instead of occupying the chair in front of her, he stands beside her and reaches out. His body is close enough that she can feel the heat emanating, his breath against one side of her face.</p><p>\u201cWith the stocks in our possession we can resist, but for how much? Less than a year, according to the calculations. Tyrion said that Daenerys has a fleet.\u201d</p><p>Jon is so close that the angry flash in his eyes doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. It\u2019s only a moment before that fleeting spark is replaced by appreciation. Jon studies the route plotted on the maps and nods with approval. \u201cDo you already have a man in mind to send?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two.\u201d She looks at him out of the corner of her eye. \u201cSer Davos and Varys.\u201d She waits for a reaction or a comment and when both don\u2019t arrive, she forces herself to ask him, \u201cDo you approve?\u201d</p><p>The request seems to surprise him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need my permission. You\u2019re the Lady of Winterfell.\u201d He gently pulls the map from her hands to watch it more carefully against the light of the candle. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I approve.\u201d</p><p>It should end there. Sansa got what she wanted. Her choice wasn\u2019t casual. Varys, the master of whispers, who sees and knows everything. His presence in Winterfell worries her more than any dragon could ever do. There are secrets that must remain such, upon which lives depend. \u201cIt means something to me,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>The bad blood and the last traces of hostility between them seem finally dispelled.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so irritating?\u201d Jon asks, but there is no real bite in his voice. A corner of his mouth is arched in a hint of smile, a genuine one. </p><p>\u201cI grew up among irritating people.\u201d She smiles in turn, maintaining eye contact. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m not <i>that</i> irritating.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, always without averting his eyes and then his expression radically changes. It gets intense and full of light and warmth and -</p><p>Arya enters without knocking and stops after just a few steps, looking at them with an arched eyebrow. \u201cDid I interrupt something?\u201d</p><p>Jon flinches as if burned. Sansa stiffens. She takes the map he hands her and rolls it up. \u201cDo you agree?\u201d She questions without looking at him.</p><p>Jon clears his throat. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Arya keeps looking at them like a hawk and her silence irritates her more than would yellings and recriminations.</p><p>When Jon leaves, Arya is still staring at her with that inquisitive look that reveals nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>Arya shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s just unusual to see you two get along so well.\u201d</p><p><i>Nobody makes him angry like you</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve smiled more since Jon came back,\u201d she adds without any connection.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point, Arya?\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cIf you have a question, say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt was a simple statement. Are you happy that he came back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be? He is our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven thougt-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had decided not to talk about it,\u201d she hisses, hushing her.</p><p>\u201cSo is what we\u2019re going to do? Pretend not to know? That this doesn\u2019t change everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing changes between us. You heard what Jon said. Titles doesn\u2019t matter. We need to focus on pressing issues, what needs to be done in order to survive.\u201d</p><p>Arya doesn\u2019t seem convinced yet. \u201cYou really don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to say? Of course I care, but that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t have to change anything. Jon remains Jon. He\u2019s a Stark. He\u2019s part of our family and we protect our family.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s not the first time they talk about this. Arya should know, understand why it\u2019s so important. At least until she gets rid of Varys, of the danger he represents. Her face is flushed and she frowns at the wolfish expression in Arya\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy are you smiling? Are you making fun of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little.\u201d</p><p>Because of course Arya knows that she cares. <i>Of course</i>. Maybe Varys isn\u2019t the dangerous one after all.</p>",
