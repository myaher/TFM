        "body": "<p>When you woke up you were surprised to find yourself laying on your bed, having no recollection of walking to your room last night but oh well. At least you were still alive right?<br/></p><p>As you ate breakfast, the ash blonde, very briefly informed you on the days plans, ate his filling, and left without saying another word. Bakugou was always man who liked to get his point across short and straight to the point, but this briefness was different. He was calm. A little\u00a0<i>too</i>\u00a0calm, almost suspicious. But you chose not to overlook it, he was probably just in deep thought. He\u2019s got war to plan out after all.</p><p><i>Yeah, he\u2019s just focused.</i></p><p>The dragon ride was the normal routine. Sitting behind him, arms around his middle, and chest pressed against his back.\u00a0<i>Normal. Nothing strange here.</i></p><p>On the contrary, an annoying fluttering in his stomach was bugging the hell out of the angry boy. This had never been a problem for him before, so why now was he getting a sickening feeling with you being so close to him? He had ridden dragons for all his life, so why did having company along with him put a spin in his gut? He instantly blamed the soothing atmosphere from the other night for causing him to do that sneaky little ploy. Little did you know, he kept flying for another hour after you had fallen asleep, taking the time to appreciate the warmth pressed against his back and the cuteness of your smaller hand intertwined in his larger one. When he finally returned back to the castle, you were still knocked out and he even willingly carried you to your room instead of opting to wake you up. As he carefully tucked you away into dreamland, he felt a state of contentment as he studied your sleeping face.</p><!-- more --><p>But never would he allow you to find out. Just by chance, Bernard had witnessed him leaving your room with a soft smile plastered on his usual scowl-clad face. Promising the servant he wouldn\u2019t live to see another day if he voiced so much of a peep.</p><p>Bakugou fought the rising heat that threatened to creep onto his face. Mentally commanding the burning feeling to back down and not appear on the tips of his ears, where it was the most visible part of his face in your sight. But your eyes were glued down to land below, completely oblivious to the males internal battle with himself.</p><p>Your day went on, as you walked with the blonde in a small city in Fujin Kingdom. Due to your past experience in the Town of Ava, you wore a cloak over your head to mask your appearance in case any wanted posters were posted or any guards on the lookout for the particular (h/c) haired young woman. Bakugou told you to wait out on the street as he quickly went to go fetch an order from a shop. You obeyed for a little while, until the waft of fresh bread tickled your nose. Following the scent you found yourself in front of a bakery not too far from the shop Bakugou had left you.</p><p><i>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a peek.\u2019</i>\u00a0you thought as you entered the warm, sunlit store. You pulled off the hood of your cloak and ogled at the large mounds of warm loaves and pastries.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fresh out of the oven.\u201d a deep voice spoke behind you, causing you to jump. The owner of the voice was a man, much bigger and bulkier than Bakugou. His brown hair spiked straight up and his face was stern and manly but he had a kind smile built on this thick lips.\u00a0<i>A friendly giant,\u00a0</i>is what you could compare him to.</p><p>\u201cOop, sorry didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d he smiled apologetically. You shook your head, \u201cNo you\u2019re fine! I could smell the bread from outside, and my nose led me here. It smells amazing!\u201d you praised. \u201cAnd the loaves are so big, I\u2019ve never seen bread this size before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d he said rubbing his neck, growing embarrassed. \u201cI really enjoy baking, it\u2019s one of my guilty pleasures. I also bake cakes and little pastries, would you like to try some?\u201d</p><p>You gasped softly and shook your head, \u201cWhat- no I couldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t have any money, I can\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine really. Go ahead take one- or two- or three!\u201d he urged you with a pat on your shoulder, \u201cI insist, a pretty young lady like you deserves a treat! And you look like a new face, I\u2019ve never seen you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! It\u2019s actually my first time here, I just like to travel around.\u201d already choosing a few pastries and a warm loaf of bread, you thanked the male and exchanged names. Bowing at the door, \u201cThank you so much Sato-kun! I\u2019ll visit again! And I\u2019ll pay you next time- even double!!\u201d,\u00a0\u201cNo problem (y/n)-chan come visit anytime! I\u2019ll always have some sweets hot and ready!\u201d you waved and left to return to the blonde who had just exited the shop himself.</p><p>\u201cKatsuki!\u201d you called running up to the male.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you go, didn\u2019t I tell you to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook I got us some bread!\u201d shoving the bag in his face, \u201cthe nice man that worked there gave it to me for free! He called me pretty hehe\u201d</p><p>There it was, that damn feeling again. You and that damn smile. Bakugou had to keep his gaze away to avoid the risk of that pesky heat sneaking to his cheeks. You were digging through the bag, pulling out a small pastry and taking a large bite out of it.</p><p>He knew you probably had a smile on your lips with your cheeks dusted pink from the small satisfied hum that rung in his ears. How he wanted to look but couldn\u2019t risk it. This was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cMmm!~ Katsuki you gotta try this, it\u2019s so good!!!\u201d you waved the pastry in front of his face, inviting him for a bite. \u201cGo ahead take a bite.\u201d</p><p>You waited for him to open his mouth, but instead of taking a bite he just gave you another refusal.</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t like sweet things, get that away from my face.\u201d turning around and walking away from you.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t yelled, or even looked in your general direction. It almost hurt and it put a sad pout to your face. You sprinted a little to catch up with him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t like sweet things, I also got some regular bread that we can share!\u201d he didn\u2019t answer you, keeping his attention forward, his pace gradually going faster. Being ignored was,\u00a0<i>lonely.</i></p><p>\u201cHey Katsuki, where are we going to now?\u201d you asked. But still no answer.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? Are you sure you don\u2019t wanna take a quick break and eat some bread?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you walking so fast? What else are we doing?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cKatsuki did you bring me to my room the other night?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou stopped in his tracks. You stared at his back, then his head turned just enough for his crimson irises to peek at you from the corner of his eye. The expression on your face was confused with a tinge of hurt. He was trying his best to ignore you and you really weren\u2019t making it easy. He wanted to push away these feelings but you kept pulling him right back.</p><p>He took a moment\u2019s breath of silence before turning back and kept walking. \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d was all he said, leaving you again without any insight.</p><p>As you watched the blonde\u2019s distance getting further and further away from you, you caught a suspicious figure at the corner of your eye. Being mindful that you were still in a place you were most wanted, you flipped your hood back over your head and caught up with retreating male.</p><p>You spent the remainder of the afternoon, quietly following the blonde. Not a peep coming from your mouth. It hurt. He knew what he did and what he was doing. He knew your nature of revulsion to being disregarded. He knew, yet he still persisted.</p><p>~</p><p>The two walked into what seemed to be a toy store. There were dolls and toy trucks stacked up on high shelves, thousands of books of different childhood fairytales, in multiple variations, and magical trinkets that bounced around balls of light. Amidst the chaos of toys, your eye caught onto one particular corner where a heap of stuffed plush animals huddled together. You eyeballed the pile with childish glimmer in you (e/c) orbs. They just all looked so cute and soft, you felt the urge just to jump in as if it were a pile of leaves in the fall.\u00a0</p><p>From the other side of the room, Bakugou had finished his business with the shopkeeper, \u201cThat your girl over there?\u201d the black haired male chided, \u201cTape it stationery before I cut open that throat of yours. Mind your fucking business. She\u2019s no one.\u201d</p><p>The ravenette held his hands up in defense, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding man, take a chill pill.\u201d pointing to the girl across the room, \u201cBut looks like she\u2019s really into those dolls over there.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou clicked his tongue, \u201cBullshit, she\u2019s afraid of dolls.\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, but that twinkle in her eyes says otherwise.\u201d the man shrugs. Bakugou stared at you with a frustrated furrow in his brows. Heaving a heavy sigh he calls to you, commanding you to go wait out, claiming that he\u2019ll be taking longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be taking one of those dolls.\u201d throwing some money on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo ahead take whatever you\u2019d like. Heh,\u00a0<i>\u2018She\u2019s no one\u2019\u00a0</i>he says.\u201d the man snickers to himself.</p><p>You sat outside, waiting on top of a nearby storage crate, quietly munching on a piece of bread.</p><p><i>\u2018What\u2019s with Katsuki today\u2026\u2019</i>\u00a0your mind drifting back to the events that occurred the day before. Recalling if you pissed him off lately or did something without intuition to the male.</p><p>While you were lost in thought you hadn\u2019t heard the male return until something soft knocked on the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cHuh? What\u2019s this?\u201d you reached up for the item, your palm met the soft plush of cotton and you gasped. It was a black stuffed rabbit with a white satin ribbon tied around its neck. Its large black button eyes staring back into your own (e/c) ones as they widened. You squealed with blissful childish fervour, it was as if you had reverted back to a 6 year old again.</p><p>Above, Bakugou\u2019s heart swelled seeing the smile restored on your face. Nothing but guilt and frustration consumed him all day. He wanted you to keep smiling &ndash; or at least occupied. He wanted you to keep asking him annoying questions until he snapped. He didn\u2019t want you to be lonely.</p><p>He\u2019d been unfair and the least he could do was give you a little something to substitute his absence.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were afraid of dolls.\u201d his voice gruff but, finally, you heard it.</p><p>Shaking your head, \u201cNot stuffed animals, these aren\u2019t creepy, just the weird porcelain ones.\u201d hugging the rabbit to your chest. \u201cHow did you know rabbits were my favorite animal?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>He stayed silent. The heat sure was venturesome.</p><p>\u201cJust a hunch huh?\u201d you giggled, \u201cWell thank you, I love it. You know the first demonic beast I summoned was actually a black rabbit. Coincidence isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>For the first time that day you made eye contact with the angry blonde. The locking of your eyes caught him off guard, causing his breath to hitch in his throat. The heat finally made its striking debut.</p><p>\u201cW-well y-yeah I guess..\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018Why the hell are you stuttering!?\u2019</i></p><p>His heart was leaping out of his chest. If he didn\u2019t look away soon he was going to be pulled right back in &ndash; as if he wasn\u2019t already slowly gravitating towards you from that one look. He didn\u2019t want to look away but this was crucial. His stupid pride was on the line.</p><p>In one swift motion his face whipped away from your gaze, so fast he might as well broken his neck. You noted the sudden recoil, and when he started walking again, you brushed it off, hoping it was nothing.\u00a0</p><p>The two had spent the entire day in the city and the sun was just starting to set. Bakugou was ready to just head back to the castle and wrap up this day to a conclusion. He was tired of seeing you try to mask the sadness and hurt in your face and voice. And he wanted nothing more than for the day to pass already and everything would be in the past</p><p><i>It was a good time to go.</i></p><p>~</p><p>Really all he wanted was to go home.</p><p>The last thing he expected to happen was to be locked inside a kingdom.</p><p>Seriously, how do you get locked inside a kingdom? And to add onto it, those damn knights of the All Mighty King put a temporary lock on his dragon\u2019s wings while he was out, so he couldn\u2019t even fly out of the border.</p><p><i>\u201cKing Bakugou, you know there is a strict rule here of leaving your personal pets unattended. We have put lock on your dragon for the night. The spell will lift at the rise of dawn.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat the fuck!?\u201d</i></p><p>Bullshit. This whole day was bullshit.</p><p>Now you two, plus Kirishima the dragon, were stuck within the walls of the Fujin Kingdom, aimlessly wandering through the forest.</p><p><i>\u2018Shitty All Mighty King with his shitty knights in his shitty kingdom with his shitty rules\u2026\u2019\u00a0</i>Bakugou cursed,\u00a0<i>\u2018Seriously who the fuck makes a rule that you can\u2019t fly at night? Fucking idiots that\u2019s who\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>The three had been walking for about half an hour. You were growing tired, your feet hurt, and you\u00a0<i>really\u00a0</i>wanted to change out of your dress. \u201cKatsuki I\u2019m so tired\u2026\u201d followed by a yawn.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He kept walking until he stopped in a small vacant space in the forest. Looking around he nodded to himself and started gathering firewood. \u201cWe\u2019ll camp here.\u201d</p><p>He took some time setting up a decent camp &ndash; well as much as you could make with twigs and rocks, and using his dragons wing as a makeshift roof. But it was enough for one shitty night stuck in a kingdom and sleeping on the hard dirt ground.</p><p>The male dropped a stack of branches at the center of the space and ordering Kirishima to blow a flame onto the wood. You took your shoes off and rubbed at your sore feet. Bakugou still keeping his distance from you, intentionally lingering closer to the edge of the forest, pretending to be distracted. Looking to the back of the male that preserved to shut you out, you knelt down by the fire, warming your hands up against the red burning life.</p><p>At least that was keeping you warm.</p><hr><p><i><b>How are you liking it so far? sorry if this chapter seemed a bit rush heh</b></i></p><p><i><b>FEEDBACK IS GREATLY APPRECIATED</b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><i><b>taglist: <i><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8EcHwLzqNVZUrSTrWz62wA\">@lovecakebacon</a> @<a href=\"https://spookyscaryskjei.tumblr.com/\" title=\"hey i\u2019m stephanie!\">spookyscaryskjei</a> @<a href=\"http://sciencethatshit.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I Want To Believe\">sciencethatshit</a> @<a href=\"http://seleniumlovelevi.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\u81ea\u7531\u306e\u7ffc\">seleniumlovelevi</a></b></i></b></i></b></i><br/></b></i></p>",

Just by chance, Bernard had witnessed him leaving your room with a soft smile plastered on his usual scowl-clad face. Promising the servant he wouldn\u2019t live to see another day if he voiced so much of a peep.</p><p>Bakugou fought the rising heat that threatened to creep onto his face. Mentally commanding the burning feeling to back down and not appear on the tips of his ears, where it was the most visible part of his face in your sight. But your eyes were glued down to land below, completely oblivious to the males internal battle with himself.</p><p>Your day went on, as you walked with the blonde in a small city in Fujin Kingdom. Due to your past experience in the Town of Ava, you wore a cloak over your head to mask your appearance in case any wanted posters were posted or any guards on the lookout for the particular (h/c) haired young woman. Bakugou told you to wait out on the street as he quickly went to go fetch an order from a shop. You obeyed for a little while, until the waft of fresh bread tickled your nose. Following the scent you found yourself in front of a bakery not too far from the shop Bakugou had left you.</p><p><i>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a peek.\u2019</i>\u00a0you thought as you entered the warm, sunlit store. You pulled off the hood of your cloak and ogled at the large mounds of warm loaves and pastries.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fresh out of the oven.\u201d a deep voice spoke behind you, causing you to jump. The owner of the voice was a man, much bigger and bulkier than Bakugou. His brown hair spiked straight up and his face was stern and manly but he had a kind smile built on this thick lips.\u00a0<i>A friendly giant,\u00a0</i>is what you could compare him to.</p><p>\u201cOop, sorry didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d he smiled apologetically.

At least you were still alive right?<br></p><p>As you ate breakfast, the ash blonde, very briefly informed you on the days plans, ate his filling, and left without saying another word. Bakugou was always man who liked to get his point across short and straight to the point, but this briefness was different. He was calm. A little\u00a0<i>too</i>\u00a0calm, almost suspicious. But you chose not to overlook it, he was probably just in deep thought. He\u2019s got war to plan out after all.</p><p><i>Yeah, he\u2019s just focused.</i></p><p>The dragon ride was the normal routine. Sitting behind him, arms around his middle, and chest pressed against his back.\u00a0<i>Normal. Nothing strange here.</i></p><p>On the contrary, an annoying fluttering in his stomach was bugging the hell out of the angry boy. This had never been a problem for him before, so why now was he getting a sickening feeling with you being so close to him? He had ridden dragons for all his life, so why did having company along with him put a spin in his gut? He instantly blamed the soothing atmosphere from the other night for causing him to do that sneaky little ploy. Little did you know, he kept flying for another hour after you had fallen asleep, taking the time to appreciate the warmth pressed against his back and the cuteness of your smaller hand intertwined in his larger one. When he finally returned back to the castle, you were still knocked out and he even willingly carried you to your room instead of opting to wake you up. As he carefully tucked you away into dreamland, he felt a state of contentment as he studied your sleeping face.</p>[[MORE]]<p>But never would he allow you to find out. Just by chance, Bernard had witnessed him leaving your room with a soft smile plastered on his usual scowl-clad face. Promising the servant he wouldn\u2019t live to see another day if he voiced so much of a peep.</p><p>Bakugou fought the rising heat that threatened to creep onto his face. Mentally commanding the burning feeling to back down and not appear on the tips of his ears, where it was the most visible part of his face in your sight. But your eyes were glued down to land below, completely oblivious to the males internal battle with himself.</p><p>Your day went on, as you walked with the blonde in a small city in Fujin Kingdom. Due to your past experience in the Town of Ava, you wore a cloak over your head to mask your appearance in case any wanted posters were posted or any guards on the lookout for the particular (h/c) haired young woman. Bakugou told you to wait out on the street as he quickly went to go fetch an order from a shop. You obeyed for a little while, until the waft of fresh bread tickled your nose. Following the scent you found yourself in front of a bakery not too far from the shop Bakugou had left you.</p><p><i>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a peek.\u2019</i>\u00a0you thought as you entered the warm, sunlit store. You pulled off the hood of your cloak and ogled at the large mounds of warm loaves and pastries.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fresh out of the oven.\u201d a deep voice spoke behind you, causing you to jump. The owner of the voice was a man, much bigger and bulkier than Bakugou. His brown hair spiked straight up and his face was stern and manly but he had a kind smile built on this thick lips.\u00a0<i>A friendly giant,\u00a0</i>is what you could compare him to.</p><p>\u201cOop, sorry didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d he smiled apologetically. You shook your head, \u201cNo you\u2019re fine! I could smell the bread from outside, and my nose led me here. It smells amazing!\u201d you praised. \u201cAnd the loaves are so big, I\u2019ve never seen bread this size before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d he said rubbing his neck, growing embarrassed. \u201cI really enjoy baking, it\u2019s one of my guilty pleasures. I also bake cakes and little pastries, would you like to try some?\u201d</p><p>You gasped softly and shook your head, \u201cWhat- no I couldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t have any money, I can\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine really. Go ahead take one- or two- or three!\u201d he urged you with a pat on your shoulder, \u201cI insist, a pretty young lady like you deserves a treat! And you look like a new face, I\u2019ve never seen you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! It\u2019s actually my first time here, I just like to travel around.\u201d already choosing a few pastries and a warm loaf of bread, you thanked the male and exchanged names. Bowing at the door, \u201cThank you so much Sato-kun! I\u2019ll visit again! And I\u2019ll pay you next time- even double!!\u201d,\u00a0\u201cNo problem (y/n)-chan come visit anytime! I\u2019ll always have some sweets hot and ready!\u201d you waved and left to return to the blonde who had just exited the shop himself.</p><p>\u201cKatsuki!\u201d you called running up to the male.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you go, didn\u2019t I tell you to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook I got us some bread!\u201d shoving the bag in his face, \u201cthe nice man that worked there gave it to me for free! He called me pretty hehe\u201d</p><p>There it was, that damn feeling again. You and that damn smile. Bakugou had to keep his gaze away to avoid the risk of that pesky heat sneaking to his cheeks. You were digging through the bag, pulling out a small pastry and taking a large bite out of it.</p><p>He knew you probably had a smile on your lips with your cheeks dusted pink from the small satisfied hum that rung in his ears. How he wanted to look but couldn\u2019t risk it. This was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cMmm!~ Katsuki you gotta try this, it\u2019s so good!!!\u201d you waved the pastry in front of his face, inviting him for a bite. \u201cGo ahead take a bite.\u201d</p><p>You waited for him to open his mouth, but instead of taking a bite he just gave you another refusal.</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t like sweet things, get that away from my face.\u201d turning around and walking away from you.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t yelled, or even looked in your general direction. It almost hurt and it put a sad pout to your face. You sprinted a little to catch up with him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t like sweet things, I also got some regular bread that we can share!\u201d he didn\u2019t answer you, keeping his attention forward, his pace gradually going faster. Being ignored was,\u00a0<i>lonely.</i></p><p>\u201cHey Katsuki, where are we going to now?\u201d you asked. But still no answer.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? Are you sure you don\u2019t wanna take a quick break and eat some bread?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you walking so fast? What else are we doing?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cKatsuki did you bring me to my room the other night?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou stopped in his tracks. You stared at his back, then his head turned just enough for his crimson irises to peek at you from the corner of his eye. The expression on your face was confused with a tinge of hurt. He was trying his best to ignore you and you really weren\u2019t making it easy. He wanted to push away these feelings but you kept pulling him right back.</p><p>He took a moment\u2019s breath of silence before turning back and kept walking. \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d was all he said, leaving you again without any insight.</p><p>As you watched the blonde\u2019s distance getting further and further away from you, you caught a suspicious figure at the corner of your eye. Being mindful that you were still in a place you were most wanted, you flipped your hood back over your head and caught up with retreating male.</p><p>You spent the remainder of the afternoon, quietly following the blonde. Not a peep coming from your mouth. It hurt. He knew what he did and what he was doing. He knew your nature of revulsion to being disregarded. He knew, yet he still persisted.</p><p>~</p><p>The two walked into what seemed to be a toy store. There were dolls and toy trucks stacked up on high shelves, thousands of books of different childhood fairytales, in multiple variations, and magical trinkets that bounced around balls of light. Amidst the chaos of toys, your eye caught onto one particular corner where a heap of stuffed plush animals huddled together. You eyeballed the pile with childish glimmer in you (e/c) orbs. They just all looked so cute and soft, you felt the urge just to jump in as if it were a pile of leaves in the fall.\u00a0</p><p>From the other side of the room, Bakugou had finished his business with the shopkeeper, \u201cThat your girl over there?\u201d the black haired male chided, \u201cTape it stationery before I cut open that throat of yours. Mind your fucking business. She\u2019s no one.\u201d</p><p>The ravenette held his hands up in defense, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding man, take a chill pill.\u201d pointing to the girl across the room, \u201cBut looks like she\u2019s really into those dolls over there.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou clicked his tongue, \u201cBullshit, she\u2019s afraid of dolls.\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, but that twinkle in her eyes says otherwise.\u201d the man shrugs. Bakugou stared at you with a frustrated furrow in his brows. Heaving a heavy sigh he calls to you, commanding you to go wait out, claiming that he\u2019ll be taking longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be taking one of those dolls.\u201d throwing some money on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo ahead take whatever you\u2019d like. Heh,\u00a0<i>\u2018She\u2019s no one\u2019\u00a0</i>he says.\u201d the man snickers to himself.</p><p>You sat outside, waiting on top of a nearby storage crate, quietly munching on a piece of bread.</p><p><i>\u2018What\u2019s with Katsuki today\u2026\u2019</i>\u00a0your mind drifting back to the events that occurred the day before. Recalling if you pissed him off lately or did something without intuition to the male.</p><p>While you were lost in thought you hadn\u2019t heard the male return until something soft knocked on the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cHuh? What\u2019s this?\u201d you reached up for the item, your palm met the soft plush of cotton and you gasped. It was a black stuffed rabbit with a white satin ribbon tied around its neck. Its large black button eyes staring back into your own (e/c) ones as they widened. You squealed with blissful childish fervour, it was as if you had reverted back to a 6 year old again.</p><p>Above, Bakugou\u2019s heart swelled seeing the smile restored on your face. Nothing but guilt and frustration consumed him all day. He wanted you to keep smiling \u2013 or at least occupied. He wanted you to keep asking him annoying questions until he snapped. He didn\u2019t want you to be lonely.</p><p>He\u2019d been unfair and the least he could do was give you a little something to substitute his absence.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were afraid of dolls.\u201d his voice gruff but, finally, you heard it.</p><p>Shaking your head, \u201cNot stuffed animals, these aren\u2019t creepy, just the weird porcelain ones.\u201d hugging the rabbit to your chest. \u201cHow did you know rabbits were my favorite animal?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>He stayed silent. The heat sure was venturesome.</p><p>\u201cJust a hunch huh?\u201d you giggled, \u201cWell thank you, I love it. You know the first demonic beast I summoned was actually a black rabbit. Coincidence isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>For the first time that day you made eye contact with the angry blonde. The locking of your eyes caught him off guard, causing his breath to hitch in his throat. The heat finally made its striking debut.</p><p>\u201cW-well y-yeah I guess..\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018Why the hell are you stuttering!?\u2019</i></p><p>His heart was leaping out of his chest. If he didn\u2019t look away soon he was going to be pulled right back in \u2013 as if he wasn\u2019t already slowly gravitating towards you from that one look. He didn\u2019t want to look away but this was crucial. His stupid pride was on the line.</p><p>In one swift motion his face whipped away from your gaze, so fast he might as well broken his neck. You noted the sudden recoil, and when he started walking again, you brushed it off, hoping it was nothing.\u00a0</p><p>The two had spent the entire day in the city and the sun was just starting to set. Bakugou was ready to just head back to the castle and wrap up this day to a conclusion. He was tired of seeing you try to mask the sadness and hurt in your face and voice.

I also bake cakes and little pastries, would you like to try some?&rdquo;</p><p>You gasped softly and shook your head, &ldquo;What- no I couldn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t have any money, I can&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s fine really. Go ahead take one- or two- or three!&rdquo; he urged you with a pat on your shoulder, &ldquo;I insist, a pretty young lady like you deserves a treat! And you look like a new face, I&rsquo;ve never seen you around?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s actually my first time here, I just like to travel around.&rdquo; already choosing a few pastries and a warm loaf of bread, you thanked the male and exchanged names. Bowing at the door, &ldquo;Thank you so much Sato-kun! I&rsquo;ll visit again! And I&rsquo;ll pay you next time- even double!!&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;No problem (y/n)-chan come visit anytime! I&rsquo;ll always have some sweets hot and ready!&rdquo; you waved and left to return to the blonde who had just exited the shop himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki!&rdquo; you called running up to the male.</p><p>&ldquo;Where the hell did you go, didn&rsquo;t I tell you to stay here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look I got us some bread!&rdquo; shoving the bag in his face, &ldquo;the nice man that worked there gave it to me for free! He called me pretty hehe&rdquo;</p><p>There it was, that damn feeling again. You and that damn smile. Bakugou had to keep his gaze away to avoid the risk of that pesky heat sneaking to his cheeks. You were digging through the bag, pulling out a small pastry and taking a large bite out of it.</p><p>He knew you probably had a smile on your lips with your cheeks dusted pink from the small satisfied hum that rung in his ears. How he wanted to look but couldn&rsquo;t risk it. This was dangerous.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm!~ Katsuki you gotta try this, it&rsquo;s so good!!!&rdquo; you waved the pastry in front of his face, inviting him for a bite. &ldquo;Go ahead take a bite.&rdquo;</p><p>You waited for him to open his mouth, but instead of taking a bite he just gave you another refusal.</p><p>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t like sweet things, get that away from my face.&rdquo; turning around and walking away from you.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t yelled, or even looked in your general direction. It almost hurt and it put a sad pout to your face. You sprinted a little to catch up with him, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t like sweet things, I also got some regular bread that we can share!&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t answer you, keeping his attention forward, his pace gradually going faster. Being ignored was,&nbsp;<i>lonely.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Katsuki, where are we going to now?&rdquo; you asked. But still no answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you hungry? Are you sure you don&rsquo;t wanna take a quick break and eat some bread?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you walking so fast? What else are we doing?&rdquo;</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki did you bring me to my room the other night?&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou stopped in his tracks. You stared at his back, then his head turned just enough for his crimson irises to peek at you from the corner of his eye. The expression on your face was confused with a tinge of hurt. He was trying his best to ignore you and you really weren&rsquo;t making it easy. He wanted to push away these feelings but you kept pulling him right back.</p><p>He took a moment&rsquo;s breath of silence before turning back and kept walking. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go&rdquo; was all he said, leaving you again without any insight.</p><p>As you watched the blonde&rsquo;s distance getting further and further away from you, you caught a suspicious figure at the corner of your eye. Being mindful that you were still in a place you were most wanted, you flipped your hood back over your head and caught up with retreating male.</p><p>You spent the remainder of the afternoon, quietly following the blonde. Not a peep coming from your mouth. It hurt. He knew what he did and what he was doing. He knew your nature of revulsion to being disregarded. He knew, yet he still persisted.</p><p>~</p><p>The two walked into what seemed to be a toy store. There were dolls and toy trucks stacked up on high shelves, thousands of books of different childhood fairytales, in multiple variations, and magical trinkets that bounced around balls of light. Amidst the chaos of toys, your eye caught onto one particular corner where a heap of stuffed plush animals huddled together. You eyeballed the pile with childish glimmer in you (e/c) orbs. They just all looked so cute and soft, you felt the urge just to jump in as if it were a pile of leaves in the fall.&nbsp;</p><p>From the other side of the room, Bakugou had finished his business with the shopkeeper, &ldquo;That your girl over there?&rdquo; the black haired male chided, &ldquo;Tape it stationery before I cut open that throat of yours. Mind your fucking business. She&rsquo;s no one.&rdquo;</p><p>The ravenette held his hands up in defense, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kidding man, take a chill pill.&rdquo; pointing to the girl across the room, &ldquo;But looks like she&rsquo;s really into those dolls over there.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou clicked his tongue, &ldquo;Bullshit, she&rsquo;s afraid of dolls.&rdquo; he grumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you say, but that twinkle in her eyes says otherwise.&rdquo; the man shrugs. Bakugou stared at you with a frustrated furrow in his brows. Heaving a heavy sigh he calls to you, commanding you to go wait out, claiming that he&rsquo;ll be taking longer.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be taking one of those dolls.&rdquo; throwing some money on the counter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead take whatever you&rsquo;d like. Heh,&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s no one&rsquo;&nbsp;</i>he says.&rdquo; the man snickers to himself.</p><p>You sat outside, waiting on top of a nearby storage crate, quietly munching on a piece of bread.</p><p><i>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s with Katsuki today&hellip;&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;your mind drifting back to the events that occurred the day before. Recalling if you pissed him off lately or did something without intuition to the male.</p><p>While you were lost in thought you hadn&rsquo;t heard the male return until something soft knocked on the top of your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; you reached up for the item, your palm met the soft plush of cotton and you gasped. It was a black stuffed rabbit with a white satin ribbon tied around its neck. Its large black button eyes staring back into your own (e/c) ones as they widened. You squealed with blissful childish fervour, it was as if you had reverted back to a 6 year old again.</p><p>Above, Bakugou&rsquo;s heart swelled seeing the smile restored on your face. Nothing but guilt and frustration consumed him all day. He wanted you to keep smiling &ndash; or at least occupied. He wanted you to keep asking him annoying questions until he snapped. He didn&rsquo;t want you to be lonely.</p><p>He&rsquo;d been unfair and the least he could do was give you a little something to substitute his absence.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were afraid of dolls.&rdquo; his voice gruff but, finally, you heard it.</p><p>Shaking your head, &ldquo;Not stuffed animals, these aren&rsquo;t creepy, just the weird porcelain ones.&rdquo; hugging the rabbit to your chest. &ldquo;How did you know rabbits were my favorite animal?&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>He stayed silent. The heat sure was venturesome.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a hunch huh?&rdquo; you giggled, &ldquo;Well thank you, I love it. You know the first demonic beast I summoned was actually a black rabbit. Coincidence isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time that day you made eye contact with the angry blonde. The locking of your eyes caught him off guard, causing his breath to hitch in his throat. The heat finally made its striking debut.</p><p>&ldquo;W-well y-yeah I guess..&rdquo;</p><p><i>&lsquo;Why the hell are you stuttering!?&rsquo;</i></p><p>His heart was leaping out of his chest. If he didn&rsquo;t look away soon he was going to be pulled right back in &ndash; as if he wasn&rsquo;t already slowly gravitating towards you from that one look. He didn&rsquo;t want to look away but this was crucial. His stupid pride was on the line.</p><p>In one swift motion his face whipped away from your gaze, so fast he might as well broken his neck. You noted the sudden recoil, and when he started walking again, you brushed it off, hoping it was nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>The two had spent the entire day in the city and the sun was just starting to set. Bakugou was ready to just head back to the castle and wrap up this day to a conclusion. He was tired of seeing you try to mask the sadness and hurt in your face and voice. And he wanted nothing more than for the day to pass already and everything would be in the past</p><p><i>It was a good time to go.</i></p><p>~</p><p>Really all he wanted was to go home.</p><p>The last thing he expected to happen was to be locked inside a kingdom.</p><p>Seriously, how do you get locked inside a kingdom? And to add onto it, those damn knights of the All Mighty King put a temporary lock on his dragon&rsquo;s wings while he was out, so he couldn&rsquo;t even fly out of the border.</p><p><i>&ldquo;King Bakugou, you know there is a strict rule here of leaving your personal pets unattended. We have put lock on your dragon for the night. The spell will lift at the rise of dawn.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What the fuck!?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bullshit. This whole day was bullshit.</p><p>Now you two, plus Kirishima the dragon, were stuck within the walls of the Fujin Kingdom, aimlessly wandering through the forest.</p><p><i>&lsquo;Shitty All Mighty King with his shitty knights in his shitty kingdom with his shitty rules&hellip;&rsquo;&nbsp;</i>Bakugou cursed,&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;Seriously who the fuck makes a rule that you can&rsquo;t fly at night? Fucking idiots that&rsquo;s who&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>The three had been walking for about half an hour. You were growing tired, your feet hurt, and you&nbsp;<i>really&nbsp;</i>wanted to change out of your dress. &ldquo;Katsuki I&rsquo;m so tired&hellip;&rdquo; followed by a yawn.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>He kept walking until he stopped in a small vacant space in the forest. Looking around he nodded to himself and started gathering firewood. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll camp here.&rdquo;</p><p>He took some time setting up a decent camp &ndash; well as much as you could make with twigs and rocks, and using his dragons wing as a makeshift roof. But it was enough for one shitty night stuck in a kingdom and sleeping on the hard dirt ground.</p><p>The male dropped a stack of branches at the center of the space and ordering Kirishima to blow a flame onto the wood. You took your shoes off and rubbed at your sore feet. Bakugou still keeping his distance from you, intentionally lingering closer to the edge of the forest, pretending to be distracted. Looking to the back of the male that preserved to shut you out, you knelt down by the fire, warming your hands up against the red burning life.</p><p>At least that was keeping you warm.</p><hr /><p><i><b>How are you liking it so far? sorry if this chapter seemed a bit rush heh</b></i></p><p><i><b>FEEDBACK IS GREATLY APPRECIATED</b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><i><b>taglist: <i><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8EcHwLzqNVZUrSTrWz62wA\">@lovecakebacon</a> @<a href=\"https://spookyscaryskjei.tumblr.com/\" title=\"hey i&rsquo;m stephanie!\">spookyscaryskjei</a> @<a href=\"http://sciencethatshit.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I Want To Believe\">sciencethatshit</a> @<a href=\"http://seleniumlovelevi.tumblr.com/\" title=\"&#33258;&#30001;&#12398;&#32764;\">seleniumlovelevi</a></b></i></b></i></b></i><br /></b></i></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>When you woke up you were surprised to find yourself laying on your bed, having no recollection of walking to your room last night but oh well. At least you were still alive right?<br /></p>\n<p>As you ate breakfast, the ash blonde, very briefly informed you on the days plans, ate his filling, and left without saying another word. Bakugou was always man who liked to get his point across short and straight to the point, but this briefness was different. He was calm. A little&nbsp;<i>too</i>&nbsp;calm, almost suspicious. But you chose not to overlook it, he was probably just in deep thought. He&rsquo;s got war to plan out after all.</p>\n<p><i>Yeah, he&rsquo;s just focused.</i></p>\n<p>The dragon ride was the normal routine. Sitting behind him, arms around his middle, and chest pressed against his back.&nbsp;<i>Normal. Nothing strange here.</i></p>\n<p>On the contrary, an annoying fluttering in his stomach was bugging the hell out of the angry boy. This had never been a problem for him before, so why now was he getting a sickening feeling with you being so close to him? He had ridden dragons for all his life, so why did having company along with him put a spin in his gut? He instantly blamed the soothing atmosphere from the other night for causing him to do that sneaky little ploy. Little did you know, he kept flying for another hour after you had fallen asleep, taking the time to appreciate the warmth pressed against his back and the cuteness of your smaller hand intertwined in his larger one. When he finally returned back to the castle, you were still knocked out and he even willingly carried you to your room instead of opting to wake you up. As he carefully tucked you away into dreamland, he felt a state of contentment as he studied your sleeping face.</p>\n</p>",
