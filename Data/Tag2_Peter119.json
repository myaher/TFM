What did i do?\u201d Gwen sincerely asked.</p><p>What your friends didn\u2019t understand was that you were still friends with Peter. But it was just that, friends. MJ understood but that\u2019s cause MJ isn\u2019t trying to get you guys back together. She knows what a mess you were after the break up. And knows if you want to get back together it\u2019s time that healed your wounds enough to make it possible.</p><p>\u201cParker!\u201d You slightly smiled when you saw him in the halls.<br/></p><p>He turned to see you coming and simply said,\u00a0\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling well can you get my homework for me?\u201d You asked looking into his eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah sure,\u201d Peter hugged you goodbye and watched you leave through the school doors.<br/></p><p>Walking away from school you had had enough.

No smiles from now one unless you truly wanted to smile.</p><p>At home you grab the ice cream out of the freezer and sit at the table with a spoon thinking about everything that has happened.

Don\u2019t bother putting up a fight.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter\u2019s met with silence. He\u2019s still on edge, which turns\nthe silence in his ears into static.

There\u2019s no sting from the light.</p><p>That\u2019s because the only light in his room comes from the\nwindow.</p><p>* * *</p><p><b>Saturday Night</b></p><p>Peter spends the late afternoon and evening at the\nAvengers facility. Most weekends, Tony lets him have free reign over one of the\nsmall labs, where he can work on a few experiments. Being at the compound has\nhelped him take his mind off the morning. He\u2019s done his research online,\ndigging for encounters similar to his. There are plenty out there, mostly about\nghosts, then about strange creatures that people claim to have witnessed.\nHowever, nothing offers an explanation as to why they\u2019re around, or how to deal\nwith them.</p><p>Peter has dinner in the common room. Tony\u2019s there too,\nleaning back in an armchair and reading a report of some kind that\u2019s an inch\nthick. They\u2019ve gone quiet after Peter explained how his projects are coming\nalong. Usually, he goes through every detail with Tony, except there\u2019s another\ntopic on his mind.</p><p>Peter fiddles with his fork as he thinks about how to\nbreach the subject. \u201cTony, I\u2019ve got a question for you,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cForty-two, that\u2019s the answer,\u201d Tony says, without\nglancing up from his report.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe number forty-two, you get it?\u201d Tony says, then upon seeing\nthe blank look on Peter\u2019s face, adds, \u201cYou know, I thought you were better at\npop culture references. Nevermind. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Peter tries not to look too serious about the question by\nslouching on the couch. \u201cJust thinking about random stuff\u2026\u201d he begins. \u201cEver wonder\nwhat other weird things could be out there? Like\u2026 based off what we\u2019ve seen, aliens\nexist. Raccoons can talk. Astral projection can be done\u2026 So at this point, is\nthere a hard line for you, between what\u2019s possible and what isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be really hard to shock me at this point, so I\nguess not.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, and digs his fork into his plate of\nspaghetti. \u201cHow about monsters? Do you believe in them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Happy exists so that\u2019s proof,\u201d Tony says, winking.\nIn the next moment, he\u2019s serious, mulling the question over. \u201cMonsters? As in\nBigfoot? Is that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, if there\u2019s any, they\u2019re deep in the ocean and tiny.\u201d</p><p>The real point of his question was to see if he could\ntell Tony about what\u2019s he\u2019s been sensing in his room without getting side-eyed\nby him. The answer Tony\u2019s just given him isn\u2019t one he\u2019s wholly assured by. He\npresses on with his other question.</p><p>\u201cWhat about ghosts?\u201d Again, Peter asks nonchalantly,\nslipping a forkful of noodles into his mouth, as though he were more interested\nin eating right now.</p><p>\u201cGhost? Oh, ninety-nine percent B.S.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so\u2026 you generally don\u2019t believe in them, but still\nbelieve a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, just a little. Like you said \u2013 with everything\nwe\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s hard to rule out everything,\u201d Tony says matter-of-factly. \u201cHow\nabout you? Do you believe?\u201d</p><p>Peter pauses to contemplate the past two nights. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d he says.</p><p>That\u2019s really how he feels. He\u2019s not lying to Tony to\nmake himself seem as sensible as he is. Even with some doubt in him about\nghosts, he\u2019s not feeling up to sleeping in his own bedroom, so that tells him\nhe\u2019s not much of a skeptic. The fact that his spider sense goes haywire is what\ndisturbs him most, what makes him think the presence in his bedroom is more\ndangerous than the usual threats being a superhero attracts.</p><p>So before he finishes his supper, he asks, \u201cIs there a\nroom for me here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere always is,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying the night as well?\u201d</p><p>Peter hopes yes. He feels like a child for it, but that\u2019s\nhow much he wants to feel safe. Tony being nearby will help that.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Tony says, and Peter\u2019s relieved.</p><hr><p><i>Thanks for reading!

Nevermind. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Peter tries not to look too serious about the question by\nslouching on the couch. \u201cJust thinking about random stuff\u2026\u201d he begins. \u201cEver wonder\nwhat other weird things could be out there? Like\u2026 based off what we\u2019ve seen, aliens\nexist. Raccoons can talk.

Do you believe in them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Happy exists so that\u2019s proof,\u201d Tony says, winking.\nIn the next moment, he\u2019s serious, mulling the question over. \u201cMonsters?

Is that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, if there\u2019s any, they\u2019re deep in the ocean and tiny.\u201d</p><p>The real point of his question was to see if he could\ntell Tony about what\u2019s he\u2019s been sensing in his room without getting side-eyed\nby him. The answer Tony\u2019s just given him isn\u2019t one he\u2019s wholly assured by. He\npresses on with his other question.</p><p>\u201cWhat about ghosts?\u201d Again, Peter asks nonchalantly,\nslipping a forkful of noodles into his mouth, as though he were more interested\nin eating right now.</p><p>\u201cGhost? Oh, ninety-nine percent B.S.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so\u2026 you generally don\u2019t believe in them, but still\nbelieve a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, just a little. Like you said \u2013 with everything\nwe\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s hard to rule out everything,\u201d Tony says matter-of-factly. \u201cHow\nabout you? Do you believe?\u201d</p><p>Peter pauses to contemplate the past two nights. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d he says.</p><p>That\u2019s really how he feels. He\u2019s not lying to Tony to\nmake himself seem as sensible as he is. Even with some doubt in him about\nghosts, he\u2019s not feeling up to sleeping in his own bedroom, so that tells him\nhe\u2019s not much of a skeptic. The fact that his spider sense goes haywire is what\ndisturbs him most, what makes him think the presence in his bedroom is more\ndangerous than the usual threats being a superhero attracts.</p><p>So before he finishes his supper, he asks, \u201cIs there a\nroom for me here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere always is,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying the night as well?\u201d</p><p>Peter hopes yes. He feels like a child for it, but that\u2019s\nhow much he wants to feel safe. Tony being nearby will help that.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Tony says, and Peter\u2019s relieved.</p><hr><p><i>Thanks for reading!

It\u2019s dim; very few lights are on. Someone\u2019s woolly scarf has fallen by\nhis feet. As Peter bends to pick it up, slight tremors go through his neck and\ninto his core.

Something jostles\nagainst a box of school supplies he has down there.<br></p><p>If this was an animal, Peter wouldn\u2019t be feeling the way\nit does. There\u2019s real danger below.<br></p><p>Quickly, Peter grabs a webshooter off his nightstand,\nfits it over his wrist, and lowers himself to the floor. On his hands and\nknees, he faces the space between the floor and his bed, and says into the\ndark, \u201cWhatever you are, get out of here.

He\npresses on with his other question.</p><p>&ldquo;What about ghosts?&rdquo; Again, Peter asks nonchalantly,\nslipping a forkful of noodles into his mouth, as though he were more interested\nin eating right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Ghost? Oh, ninety-nine percent B.S.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so&hellip; you generally don&rsquo;t believe in them, but still\nbelieve a little bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, just a little. Like you said &ndash; with everything\nwe&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s hard to rule out everything,&rdquo; Tony says matter-of-factly. &ldquo;How\nabout you? Do you believe?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter pauses to contemplate the past two nights. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>That&rsquo;s really how he feels. He&rsquo;s not lying to Tony to\nmake himself seem as sensible as he is. Even with some doubt in him about\nghosts, he&rsquo;s not feeling up to sleeping in his own bedroom, so that tells him\nhe&rsquo;s not much of a skeptic. The fact that his spider sense goes haywire is what\ndisturbs him most, what makes him think the presence in his bedroom is more\ndangerous than the usual threats being a superhero attracts.</p><p>So before he finishes his supper, he asks, &ldquo;Is there a\nroom for me here tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There always is,&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you staying the night as well?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hopes yes. He feels like a child for it, but that&rsquo;s\nhow much he wants to feel safe. Tony being nearby will help that.</p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Tony says, and Peter&rsquo;s relieved.</p><hr /><p><i>Thanks for reading!

It&rsquo;s dim; very few lights are on. Someone&rsquo;s woolly scarf has fallen by\nhis feet. As Peter bends to pick it up, slight tremors go through his neck and\ninto his core. This is his spider-sense warning him about something.</p>\n<p>The feeling is so real in his dream that he wakes up.\nWithin a second, Peter registers that he has been dreaming and that he&rsquo;s lying\nin his bed on the lower bunk. He casts the sheets right off himself, ready to\ndefend against whoever or whatever&rsquo;s near.</p>\n<p>He scans every edge of his darkened room, but there&rsquo;s\nnothing strange. He pulls himself onto his feet and checks the top bunk. All\nthere is, is his mountain of laundry. He turns to his door, wanting to make\nsure May is fine, but on his third step, he feels completely normal again.</p>\n<p>Peter waits, in case the sensation returns. He checks his\ncloset, peaks down the hall, looks into his aunt&rsquo;s room where she&rsquo;s sleeping\nsoundly, and finds that all he there is to do now, is to get back under his\nsheets. He can&rsquo;t feel the threatening presence anymore. Maybe it all had to do\nwith his dream.</p>\n<p>As he falls asleep, he keeps wondering what set him off,\nbut comes to no conclusion.</p>\n</p>",
