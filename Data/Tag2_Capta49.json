I watched her, unable to stop grinning at the fact that we were actually <i>together</i> together. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was laughing, her eyes squinted adorably and her laugh lines portraying her happiness at this moment. I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better sight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Watch, I can get this in my mouth,&ldquo; she said, sure of herself, her hazel eyes meeting mine. </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Just watch!&ldquo; she said, before setting her plate on the table and tossing an olive in the air. She opened her mouth to catch it, but of course she was way off and it hit her on the head before bouncing onto the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Ten out of ten,&rdquo; I said teasingly, to which she shoved me, almost making me drop my own plate.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I can usually catch it,&ldquo; she said, pouting adorably. &quot;It&rsquo;s because you stared.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. &ldquo;Oh, yeah, next time I&rsquo;ll be sure to close my eyes and believe you caught it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thank you,&ldquo; she said, grinning. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We continued to mess around by the appetisers, still stuffing ourselves with food, until we heard the music cut off and an announcement coming from the stage. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Can everybody please come to the stage where the bride will be making a speech!&rdquo; a staff member said, his voice blasting through the speakers and to all the guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Brie with confusion. &ldquo;I thought speeches were done.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged, unsure herself, before taking my plate off me and setting it  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0on the table. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey, I was eating that!&ldquo; I complained, about to pick it up again, but she stepped in the way and pushed me forward gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;We gotta hear what your mum has to say,&rdquo; she said, smiling with amusement. &ldquo;Food after, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed, but intertwined my fingers with hers, letting her lead me to the small crowd of guests that had formed. My mum was on the stage, standing in front of the mic. I noticed how she didn&rsquo;t seem even the tiniest bit nervous. She never was. I didn&rsquo;t understand how her and I could be so different from one another. If I was up there, I&rsquo;d probably faint. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;If I could have your attention please,&ldquo; she began, looking out at everyone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The chatter went quiet before a silence formed. All you could hear was the mic tuning and the sound of the waves on the beach in the distance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I know we already did speeches, but this is a little different,&rdquo; she said, her voice radiating confidence and certainty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of an announcement.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I waited patiently, wondering what she was going to say. I saw her glance to the left, at Isaac who was stood offstage but smiling encouragingly at her. She looked back to everyone before continuing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;As you all know, today has been a massive step forward in my personal life,&ldquo; she explained, a smile on her lips. &quot;It&rsquo;s a change I have welcomed with open arms and it&rsquo;s only made me realise that there&rsquo;s other aspects of my life that I wish to move forward with.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows with confusion. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Most of you here are friends and colleagues of mine,&ldquo; she said, nodding. &quot;I&rsquo;m grateful for all you of. Meeting so many people in my line of work is something I anticipated. Being a lawyer and having my own firm is something I am thankful for. But I&rsquo;ve come to a point now where I realise that it&rsquo;s a chapter of my life I&rsquo;m ready to finish.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I raised my eyebrows as everyone began to mutter between one another. I recalled what Naomi said about her giving away the firm, but I never realised it could actually be true. Is that what she was going to announce?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked around, trying to see if Naomi and Kieran were here when finally, I caught Naomi&rsquo;s glare from across the crowd. She was fuming, her arms crossed and her brother shaking his head with annoyance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Hey, you okay?&ldquo; Brie asked quietly, squeezing my hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I met her eyes. &quot;I, erm, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She cocked her head to the side questioningly, but she didn&rsquo;t get to say anything because my mum was speaking again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;It took a lot of planning, but I have decided to give my firm away,&ldquo; she announced, everyone&rsquo;s eyes on her. Her eyes scanned the crowd before they met mine. &quot;Y/N, I want to give it to you.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I gulped down the lump in my throat as everybody turned to look at me. I suddenly felt really warm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Now, you&rsquo;ve made it very clear that you don&rsquo;t want to be a lawyer,&ldquo; my mum said, a bit of sourness still present in her voice that only I could detect from the millions of times she&rsquo;d said that to me, &quot;but this is different. You can sell the firm if you want. Or manage it. The possibilities are endless. I just want you to have it. It should stay in the family.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out, pursing my lips. People were looking between my mum and I, expecting one of us to say something else. Even Brie was surprised, her eyes boring into the side of my head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Well, honey?&ldquo; my mum spoke, a flicker of confusion crossing her expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I finally found my words. &quot;Mum, I can&rsquo;t accept.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard people gasp around me, mumbling between each other as they looked me up and down judgementally. Any one of these people would snap up the opportunity to buy this firm - it made millions. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Erm, what was that?&ldquo; my mum asked, her smile forced now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I shook my head, speaking louder. &quot;No, thank you!&rdquo; All eyes were on me and I tried to focus. Brie smiled encouragingly and I remembered what I wanted to say as I looked back to my mum. &ldquo;It should stay in the family, yes, but it should go to Naomi and Kieran!&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked to my cousins, seeing the shock on their faces. My mum seemed speechless for one of the first times in my life. I didn&rsquo;t want the firm. I didn&rsquo;t need it. Yes, I could probably make a fortune like my mum, but that&rsquo;s not what I wanted. I had everything I needed. Plus, as annoying as Naomi and Kieran were, they had worked hard and deserved the firm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I see,&ldquo; my mum finally spoke, earning everyone&rsquo;s attention. Her signature business-meeting smile was back on her face as she said, &quot;The firm shall be passed down to my lovely niece and nephew, Naomi and Kieran.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Nobody knew what to do at first, but then somebody started to clap and everyone joined in, cheering for the siblings and moving their way to congratulate them. I breathed out with relief and tried to ignore the glare coming from my mother. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Food?&ldquo; I asked Brie, wanting nothing more than for her to drag me away from the inevitable yelling I was about to get. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Er, I think your mum wants you,&rdquo; she said, looking a little frightened when she pointed over my shoulder.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, sighing to myself, before turning around and seeing her stood with Isaac offstage, motioning for me to come to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You said you wouldn&rsquo;t leave me alone,&ldquo; I told Brie, before dragging her along with me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The two of us approached my mum and Isaac and she did <i>not </i>look happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N, I need to speak with you privately,&rdquo; she said, containing her annoyance as best as she could whilst her eyes flickered to Brie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a family matter.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Brie is part of the family, as you&rsquo;ve said countless of times,&ldquo; I pointed out, not letting go of Brie&rsquo;s hand. &quot;Whatever you say to me can be said in front of her.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum breathed out before nodding. &ldquo;Fine. Care to explain why you embarrassed me up there like that?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Now, Y/M/N, that&rsquo;s not what you said you would say,&ldquo; Isaac spoke up before I could. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum clenched her jaw before nodding. I looked at Isaac gratefully, who\u00a0smiled apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Why don&rsquo;t you want the firm, Y/N?&rdquo; she rephrased, less aggressively. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I didn&rsquo;t ask for it,&ldquo; I said calmly. &quot;I don&rsquo;t need it. I already have everything I need.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You didn&rsquo;t need to ask for it,&ldquo; she said, shaking her head. &quot;You&rsquo;re my only child. It&rsquo;s a family firm. <i>You&rsquo;re </i>my family.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;So are Naomi and Kieran,&ldquo; I stated. &quot;And they really wanted it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You don&rsquo;t even like them!&ldquo; she shouted quietly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/M/N&hellip;&rdquo; Isaac reminded her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Sorry,&ldquo; she mumbled, before looking to me. &quot;I never thought you would advocate for them when you&rsquo;ve made it very clear how you feel about them.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I know I say stuff, but at the end of the day, they deserve the firm more than I. You&rsquo;re giving it to me out of obligation. They actually <i>want</i> to make use of it. They can continue your work with their talent and your name. You chose me over them because of this false sense of pride you have for me.&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Her expression softened. &quot;I <i>am </i>proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled sadly. &ldquo;Why? Because I now have a girlfriend? I&rsquo;m still the same person, mum. Still a school councillor. Still living in a flat. Still not going to the gym, or buying designer clothes. I&rsquo;m still me. Except I have a girlfriend who just happens to be famous. What&rsquo;s changed?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stayed silent, looking between Brie and I. Isaac watched me, nodding his head as a proud smile appeared on his lips. I felt recognised for a change. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I shouldn&rsquo;t have come here under these circumstances,&ldquo; I admitted. &quot;Brie and I weren&rsquo;t together, okay?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N-&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;It&rsquo;s okay, Brie,&rdquo; I said, letting go of her hand as I smiled confidently at her. I looked back to my mum, who was surprised. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t together. You assumed we were together because you didn&rsquo;t listen, mum. You <i>never </i>listen. I faked it. It started off as a way to make you proud, but I know I can never do that. Then it turned into me proving a point. But now I know none of that matters.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;So, what, this is fake?&ldquo; was all she could ask, motioning to the two of us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I shook my head. &quot;It was very much real. Just not in the way you thought. And we&rsquo;re together now. That&rsquo;s one of the few amazing things to come out of this whole thing.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out as my mum avoided my eyes, her expression unreadable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Not so proud anymore, right?&ldquo; I asked, cracking a sad smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; Isaac began, before staying quiet. He could only speak for himself, and I didn&rsquo;t want to hear from him right now. I wanted to hear from the one person who wasn&rsquo;t saying anything to me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I love you, mum, but I deserve to be treated right, despite my personal relationships and life choices,&ldquo; I said, finally believing my words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0It was quiet for way too long, at least that&rsquo;s what it felt like. She wasn&rsquo;t even looking at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thank you for coming,&rdquo; she finally said, but she didn&rsquo;t look my way as she walked away from us all. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, sighing to myself. I tried not to get my hopes up with her, but this time I really thought&hellip; I thought she would at least acknowledge my words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;She&rsquo;s going to come around,&ldquo; Isaac said, and I opened my eyes to see him moving forward and pulling me in for a hug. I returned the hug, frowning a little. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;She won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, sure of myself. We pulled away and I said, &ldquo;Thank you, though.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He smiled sadly. &ldquo;I should go and check on her&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded and he walked away. I pinched the bridge of my nose, tilting my head back as I willed a tear to go back into my eye. After a moment, I let go and turned around to see Brie smiling sadly at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry that didn&rsquo;t go how it should have,&ldquo; she said softly, stepping forward and taking my hand, holding it between both of hers, &quot;but I&rsquo;m really proud of you for telling the truth. All of it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I felt my throat closing up horribly, a familiar feeling I always felt before I cried. I shook my head, willing myself to hold it in. &ldquo;I thought&hellip; I thought telling the truth was supposed to hurt a lot less.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I knew my mum was like this, so why was I surprised? She&rsquo;d said horrible things to me in the past, but I didn&rsquo;t know her saying nothing would hurt so much more. My heart ached. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Y/N,&ldquo; Brie said, pulling me close to her, and I closed my eyes, tucking my head into her shoulder as she held me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I didn&rsquo;t cry - I couldn&rsquo;t, not here, not now. I felt silly. But Brie comforted me anyway, rubbing soothing circles on my back as I tried to ignore the pain in my chest. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out with relief as I settled into the aeroplane seat. Brie and I were on our flight back to L.A and one of my least favourite things was getting through airport security. Thankfully though, we were in first class (because of my mum&rsquo;s pre-paid tickets) so the seats were super comfortable. <i>Un</i>fortunately, my mum was on the same plane as us, so I still had to see her and Isaac off when we landed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Stop thinking about it,&rdquo; Brie said, pulling me from my thoughts. I glanced at her seat beside me and she was giving me a knowing smile. &ldquo;I can tell you&rsquo;re thinking about it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I can&rsquo;t help it,&ldquo; I said, shrugging my shoulders. I leaned on her shoulder, cuddling into her arm. &quot;She&rsquo;s not speaking to me, Brie. It&rsquo;s been more than 24 hours.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie pressed a kiss to the top of my head before leaning on me, too. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come around. Isaac said so himself.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so I said nothing as I chewed the inside of my mouth nervously. My mum hadn&rsquo;t said a word to me since the wedding and at first, yeah, it hurt a lot. But I couldn&rsquo;t <i>not </i>speak to my mum. She was my mum! She couldn&rsquo;t just leave and not speak to me ever again. Could she?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re still thinking about it, aren&rsquo;t you?&ldquo; she asked, a hint of amusement in her voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed. &quot;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Think about something else,&ldquo; she suggested. &quot;Food. Movies. Going back home. Anything else otherwise you&rsquo;re going to be upset the whole flight back.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sat up straight and held Brie&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; I looked at her, smiling as I saw how cute she looked. She was wearing no makeup and her hair was pulled back into a little bun. She was wearing an oversized hoodie and she looked so comfy. I was a little jealous. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you thinking now?&ldquo; she asked, leaning on the armrest and meeting my eyes with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled wider. &quot;I&rsquo;m thinking about how cute you look. And also that I regret not bringing my own hoodie because you look <i>really</i> comfortable.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Her cheeks went pink as she shook her head. &ldquo;Uh-uh. Eyes off. You&rsquo;re <i>not </i>getting my hoodie, Y/N. This one&rsquo;s my favourite.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I never asked for it,&ldquo; I defended, chuckling. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; she retorted, shaking her head still. &ldquo;Eyes off.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I laughed now, leaning forward and giving her a haste kiss. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I can&rsquo;t believe you stole my hoodie when I was asleep,&ldquo; Brie mumbled, sulking as we grabbed our suitcases off the luggage carousel. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You shouldn&rsquo;t have taken it off,&rdquo; I pointed out, grinning. &ldquo;Totally your fault.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She narrowed her eyes at me, shaking her head distastefully. I laughed, pulling the sleeves over my hands comfortably. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Smells like you,&ldquo; I revelled in the scent. &quot;I love it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m right here!&ldquo; she said with raised eyebrows. &quot;Smell me, I don&rsquo;t care, but don&rsquo;t steal my hoodie!&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I laughed as we walked away from the luggage carousel, away from the bustle of other people collecting their luggage. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You can have it back if you really want,&ldquo; I told her, giving her my best &lsquo;serious&rsquo; look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stared at me curiously, before sighing with defeat. &quot;You&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned, leaning forward and kissing her gently. When I pulled away, a hint of a smile was playing on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Right. Are you sure you&rsquo;ve got everything?&ldquo; she asked, her eyes scanning our luggage. &quot;Not left anything behind?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, doing a final check before looking at me, her expression softening. &ldquo;We should say goodbye to Isaac and your mum.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My smile faded as I breathed out slowly. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She gave me an encouraging smile and intertwined her fingers with mine. I accepted her comfort and looked out to the luggage collection point, searching for either Isaac or my mum. I eventually saw them grabbing the last of their bags before they turned, heading our way. They hadn&rsquo;t seen us at first and I considered just leaving. But when Isaac looked up and gave me a bright smile, I knew I couldn&rsquo;t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You got this,&ldquo; Brie whispered as they stopped before us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled at her before looking to my mum, seeing she was looking to the floor. Great. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Well, girls, I guess this is where we depart ways,&rdquo; Isaac spoke first, looking between us. &ldquo;It was a pleasure having you both at the wedding. And Brie,&rdquo; he looked to Brie, smiling appreciatively, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a lovely woman. It was an honour to meet you. I hope this isn&rsquo;t the last time. Especially now that you and Y/N are official.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie grinned. &ldquo;Thank you for having me, Isaac. And I hope not either. Congratulations, once again.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac looked to me and I choked on my own words for a moment, until I felt Brie squeeze my hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thank you, Isaac,&ldquo; I finally got out, letting go of Brie and hugging him suddenly. &quot;For everything. I&rsquo;ll make sure to bug you with a call every week, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac chuckled, returning the hug. When we pulled away, I noticed his eyes were a little glassy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;d really like that, Y/N,&ldquo; he said, unable to stop smiling now. It warmed my heart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced at my mum, wondering if she was going to say anything. She was still staring at the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Hey, Isaac, do you think you could help me do something?&rdquo; Brie suddenly spoke. &ldquo;Over, erm, over there?&rdquo; She nodded to the left and I realised what she was doing. So did Isaac, too, as he nodded enthusiastically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Yes, of course,&ldquo; he said, and the two of them walked away to give my mum and I space. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum was still quiet though and I felt nervous, remembering how she walked away the last time we spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;So is this it?&rdquo; I asked, grabbing her attention. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t speak anymore?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, but didn&rsquo;t say anything. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to not speak to you, mum,&ldquo; I told her, frowning. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She sighed. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want to not speak either.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I felt my racing heart slow down a little. She was speaking. That was good, right?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Okay, well, what now?&ldquo; I asked. &quot;You want to yell at me? Because go for it! I don&rsquo;t care, you can embarrass me in front of Brie and Isaac and complete strangers. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She cracked a small smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip; I&rsquo;m not angry.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She shook her head. &ldquo;No, Y/N. I&rsquo;m just&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I widened my eyes, certainly not expecting that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You were right,&ldquo; she said, nodding. &quot;About what you said. I don&rsquo;t listen. I don&rsquo;t treat you fairly.&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. She usually never listened to me and she was insanely stubborn, so this was different. She was acknowledging her actions and it was something I&rsquo;d only ever dreamed she would do. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re not a kid anymore,&ldquo; she continued. &quot;You have a life. And when you were a kid, you had to deal with me. You couldn&rsquo;t push me away. But now you&rsquo;re grown up and I don&rsquo;t want to lose you.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Mum, you&rsquo;ll never lose me,&ldquo; I said instantly, stepping forward and resting a hand on her forearm. &quot;Yeah, you piss me off at times, but that&rsquo;s just who you are. I&rsquo;m used to it. I still love you. I always will. I just wanted you to realise that sometimes your words hurt.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I get that now,&ldquo; she said, a tear slipping from her eye which she immediately wiped away. I was shocked at how this was affecting her. I didn&rsquo;t think she cared. &quot;I&rsquo;ll be kinder to you, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see that, honestly.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She rolled her eyes and smacked me on the shoulder playfully before pulling me in for a hug, which I happily accepted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m proud of you, Y/N,&ldquo; she said honestly, holding me at arm&rsquo;s length when we pulled away. &quot;I mean it. You&rsquo;re happy and I&rsquo;m glad. And Brie is wonderful. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re both together.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thank you,&ldquo; I said, smiling at her. &quot;I&rsquo;m sorry I lied at first.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I deserved it,&ldquo; she muttered, making me laugh. &quot;Look. I don&rsquo;t want us to be like before where I&rsquo;m lucky if I get a call every now and then.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded in agreement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll visit you more. I&rsquo;ll call more. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She smiled. &ldquo;Good&hellip; now I think we should wrap this up because Isaac and Brie are trying really hard to listen to what we&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced over my shoulder and suppressed a laugh when I saw the two of them pretending to have a conversation, but making it obvious they were listening in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;We&rsquo;re all good, you guys can come back,&ldquo; I called to them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0They came back to us immediately, smiling hopefully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;All good?&rdquo; Brie asked quietly, looking at me with concerned eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled. &ldquo;All good.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She smiled with relief, wrapping an arm around my waist. &ldquo;Awesome. I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I guess this is goodbye for now,&ldquo; my mum said, grabbing our attention. She looked to Brie, smiling with gratitude. &quot;Brie, dear, thank you for attending our wedding. As Isaac said earlier, I hope we can see more of each other in the future.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie nodded, smiling politely. &ldquo;Of course, Y/M/N.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;First you guys should honeymoon it up,&ldquo; I said, looking between my mum and Isaac. &quot;Which reminds me, where are you guys going for your honeymoon?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;That&rsquo;s undecided,&ldquo; Isaac said, giving my mum a knowing look. &quot;Somebody can&rsquo;t make up her mind.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum waved her hand dismissively. &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no rush! We have plenty of time to decide.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We all laughed and Brie nudged me gently, making me look at her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I know where you get your indecisiveness from now,&ldquo; she mumbled in my ear, making me glare at her playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Okay, girls, our taxi should be waiting for us, so we should really get going,&rdquo; Isaac said apologetically. &ldquo;Are you both okay for a ride or&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;We&rsquo;ll be fine,&ldquo; I said, waving my hand. &quot;You guys go. I&rsquo;ll call you tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;We look forward to it,&ldquo; my mum said, smiling with relief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We all exchanged hugs once more before bidding Isaac and my mum a goodbye. Brie and I also went our own way, managing to find a taxi to take us back to our flat. I felt so much more happier as we sat in the backseat, on our way home. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m really happy for you, Y/N,&rdquo; Brie said, squeezing my hand. &ldquo;You did good.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled at her with adoration. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Yeah you could&rsquo;ve,&ldquo; she said with certainty. &quot;You&rsquo;re strong. That&rsquo;s why I love you.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I was a little surprised to hear her say that, and she must have realised what she said because her smile faded and any confidence she once had was now gone and replaced by nervousness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I- erm-&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re honest,&rdquo; I cut her off, not breaking eye contact. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why <i>I </i>love <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She raised her eyebrows with surprise, but eventually a toothy smile broke out on her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I love you.&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned. &quot;I love you, too, Brie.&rdquo;</p>",

I watched her, unable to stop grinning at the fact that we were actually <i>together</i> together. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was laughing, her eyes squinted adorably and her laugh lines portraying her happiness at this moment.

She opened her mouth to catch it, but of course she was way off and it hit her on the head before bouncing onto the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Ten out of ten,\u201d I said teasingly, to which she shoved me, almost making me drop my own plate.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can usually catch it,\u201c she said, pouting adorably. \"It\u2019s because you stared.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. \u201cOh, yeah, next time I\u2019ll be sure to close my eyes and believe you caught it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you,\u201c she said, grinning. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We continued to mess around by the appetisers, still stuffing ourselves with food, until we heard the music cut off and an announcement coming from the stage. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can everybody please come to the stage where the bride will be making a speech!\u201d a staff member said, his voice blasting through the speakers and to all the guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Brie with confusion. \u201cI thought speeches were done.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged, unsure herself, before taking my plate off me and setting it  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0on the table. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, I was eating that!\u201c I complained, about to pick it up again, but she stepped in the way and pushed me forward gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We gotta hear what your mum has to say,\u201d she said, smiling with amusement. \u201cFood after, I promise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed, but intertwined my fingers with hers, letting her lead me to the small crowd of guests that had formed. My mum was on the stage, standing in front of the mic. I noticed how she didn\u2019t seem even the tiniest bit nervous. She never was. I didn\u2019t understand how her and I could be so different from one another. If I was up there, I\u2019d probably faint. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"If I could have your attention please,\u201c she began, looking out at everyone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The chatter went quiet before a silence formed. All you could hear was the mic tuning and the sound of the waves on the beach in the distance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I know we already did speeches, but this is a little different,\u201d she said, her voice radiating confidence and certainty. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an announcement.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I waited patiently, wondering what she was going to say. I saw her glance to the left, at Isaac who was stood offstage but smiling encouragingly at her. She looked back to everyone before continuing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"As you all know, today has been a massive step forward in my personal life,\u201c she explained, a smile on her lips. \"It\u2019s a change I have welcomed with open arms and it\u2019s only made me realise that there\u2019s other aspects of my life that I wish to move forward with.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows with confusion. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Most of you here are friends and colleagues of mine,\u201c she said, nodding. \"I\u2019m grateful for all you of. Meeting so many people in my line of work is something I anticipated. Being a lawyer and having my own firm is something I am thankful for. But I\u2019ve come to a point now where I realise that it\u2019s a chapter of my life I\u2019m ready to finish.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I raised my eyebrows as everyone began to mutter between one another. I recalled what Naomi said about her giving away the firm, but I never realised it could actually be true. Is that what she was going to announce?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked around, trying to see if Naomi and Kieran were here when finally, I caught Naomi\u2019s glare from across the crowd. She was fuming, her arms crossed and her brother shaking his head with annoyance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, you okay?\u201c Brie asked quietly, squeezing my hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I met her eyes. \"I, erm, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She cocked her head to the side questioningly, but she didn\u2019t get to say anything because my mum was speaking again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It took a lot of planning, but I have decided to give my firm away,\u201c she announced, everyone\u2019s eyes on her. Her eyes scanned the crowd before they met mine. \"Y/N, I want to give it to you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I gulped down the lump in my throat as everybody turned to look at me. I suddenly felt really warm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Now, you\u2019ve made it very clear that you don\u2019t want to be a lawyer,\u201c my mum said, a bit of sourness still present in her voice that only I could detect from the millions of times she\u2019d said that to me, \"but this is different. You can sell the firm if you want. Or manage it. The possibilities are endless. I just want you to have it. It should stay in the family.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out, pursing my lips. People were looking between my mum and I, expecting one of us to say something else. Even Brie was surprised, her eyes boring into the side of my head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, honey?\u201c my mum spoke, a flicker of confusion crossing her expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I finally found my words. \"Mum, I can\u2019t accept.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard people gasp around me, mumbling between each other as they looked me up and down judgementally. Any one of these people would snap up the opportunity to buy this firm - it made millions. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Erm, what was that?\u201c my mum asked, her smile forced now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I shook my head, speaking louder. \"No, thank you!\u201d All eyes were on me and I tried to focus. Brie smiled encouragingly and I remembered what I wanted to say as I looked back to my mum. \u201cIt should stay in the family, yes, but it should go to Naomi and Kieran!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked to my cousins, seeing the shock on their faces. My mum seemed speechless for one of the first times in my life. I didn\u2019t want the firm. I didn\u2019t need it. Yes, I could probably make a fortune like my mum, but that\u2019s not what I wanted. I had everything I needed. Plus, as annoying as Naomi and Kieran were, they had worked hard and deserved the firm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I see,\u201c my mum finally spoke, earning everyone\u2019s attention. Her signature business-meeting smile was back on her face as she said, \"The firm shall be passed down to my lovely niece and nephew, Naomi and Kieran.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Nobody knew what to do at first, but then somebody started to clap and everyone joined in, cheering for the siblings and moving their way to congratulate them. I breathed out with relief and tried to ignore the glare coming from my mother. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Food?\u201c I asked Brie, wanting nothing more than for her to drag me away from the inevitable yelling I was about to get. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Er, I think your mum wants you,\u201d she said, looking a little frightened when she pointed over my shoulder.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, sighing to myself, before turning around and seeing her stood with Isaac offstage, motioning for me to come to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You said you wouldn\u2019t leave me alone,\u201c I told Brie, before dragging her along with me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The two of us approached my mum and Isaac and she did <i>not </i>look happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, I need to speak with you privately,\u201d she said, containing her annoyance as best as she could whilst her eyes flickered to Brie. \u201cIt\u2019s a family matter.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Brie is part of the family, as you\u2019ve said countless of times,\u201c I pointed out, not letting go of Brie\u2019s hand. \"Whatever you say to me can be said in front of her.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum breathed out before nodding. \u201cFine. Care to explain why you embarrassed me up there like that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Now, Y/M/N, that\u2019s not what you said you would say,\u201c Isaac spoke up before I could. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum clenched her jaw before nodding. I looked at Isaac gratefully, who\u00a0smiled apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Why don\u2019t you want the firm, Y/N?\u201d she rephrased, less aggressively. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I didn\u2019t ask for it,\u201c I said calmly. \"I don\u2019t need it. I already have everything I need.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You didn\u2019t need to ask for it,\u201c she said, shaking her head. \"You\u2019re my only child. It\u2019s a family firm. <i>You\u2019re </i>my family.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So are Naomi and Kieran,\u201c I stated. \"And they really wanted it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You don\u2019t even like them!\u201c she shouted quietly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/M/N\u2026\u201d Isaac reminded her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry,\u201c she mumbled, before looking to me. \"I never thought you would advocate for them when you\u2019ve made it very clear how you feel about them.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I know I say stuff, but at the end of the day, they deserve the firm more than I. You\u2019re giving it to me out of obligation. They actually <i>want</i> to make use of it. They can continue your work with their talent and your name. You chose me over them because of this false sense of pride you have for me.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Her expression softened. \"I <i>am </i>proud of you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled sadly. \u201cWhy? Because I now have a girlfriend? I\u2019m still the same person, mum. Still a school councillor. Still living in a flat. Still not going to the gym, or buying designer clothes. I\u2019m still me. Except I have a girlfriend who just happens to be famous. What\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stayed silent, looking between Brie and I. Isaac watched me, nodding his head as a proud smile appeared on his lips. I felt recognised for a change. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I shouldn\u2019t have come here under these circumstances,\u201c I admitted. \"Brie and I weren\u2019t together, okay?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It\u2019s okay, Brie,\u201d I said, letting go of her hand as I smiled confidently at her. I looked back to my mum, who was surprised. \u201cWe weren\u2019t together. You assumed we were together because you didn\u2019t listen, mum. You <i>never </i>listen. I faked it. It started off as a way to make you proud, but I know I can never do that. Then it turned into me proving a point. But now I know none of that matters.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So, what, this is fake?\u201c was all she could ask, motioning to the two of us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I shook my head. \"It was very much real. Just not in the way you thought. And we\u2019re together now. That\u2019s one of the few amazing things to come out of this whole thing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out as my mum avoided my eyes, her expression unreadable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Not so proud anymore, right?\u201c I asked, cracking a sad smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N\u2026\u201d Isaac began, before staying quiet. He could only speak for himself, and I didn\u2019t want to hear from him right now. I wanted to hear from the one person who wasn\u2019t saying anything to me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I love you, mum, but I deserve to be treated right, despite my personal relationships and life choices,\u201c I said, finally believing my words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0It was quiet for way too long, at least that\u2019s what it felt like. She wasn\u2019t even looking at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you for coming,\u201d she finally said, but she didn\u2019t look my way as she walked away from us all. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, sighing to myself. I tried not to get my hopes up with her, but this time I really thought\u2026 I thought she would at least acknowledge my words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"She\u2019s going to come around,\u201c Isaac said, and I opened my eyes to see him moving forward and pulling me in for a hug. I returned the hug, frowning a little. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"She won\u2019t,\u201d I said, sure of myself. We pulled away and I said, \u201cThank you, though.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He smiled sadly. \u201cI should go and check on her\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded and he walked away. I pinched the bridge of my nose, tilting my head back as I willed a tear to go back into my eye. After a moment, I let go and turned around to see Brie smiling sadly at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry that didn\u2019t go how it should have,\u201c she said softly, stepping forward and taking my hand, holding it between both of hers, \"but I\u2019m really proud of you for telling the truth. All of it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I felt my throat closing up horribly, a familiar feeling I always felt before I cried. I shook my head, willing myself to hold it in. \u201cI thought\u2026 I thought telling the truth was supposed to hurt a lot less.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I knew my mum was like this, so why was I surprised? She\u2019d said horrible things to me in the past, but I didn\u2019t know her saying nothing would hurt so much more. My heart ached. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m so sorry, Y/N,\u201c Brie said, pulling me close to her, and I closed my eyes, tucking my head into her shoulder as she held me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t cry - I couldn\u2019t, not here, not now. I felt silly. But Brie comforted me anyway, rubbing soothing circles on my back as I tried to ignore the pain in my chest. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out with relief as I settled into the aeroplane seat. Brie and I were on our flight back to L.A and one of my least favourite things was getting through airport security. Thankfully though, we were in first class (because of my mum\u2019s pre-paid tickets) so the seats were super comfortable. <i>Un</i>fortunately, my mum was on the same plane as us, so I still had to see her and Isaac off when we landed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Stop thinking about it,\u201d Brie said, pulling me from my thoughts. I glanced at her seat beside me and she was giving me a knowing smile. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I can\u2019t help it,\u201c I said, shrugging my shoulders. I leaned on her shoulder, cuddling into her arm. \"She\u2019s not speaking to me, Brie. It\u2019s been more than 24 hours.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie pressed a kiss to the top of my head before leaning on me, too. \u201cShe\u2019ll come around. Isaac said so himself.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I said nothing as I chewed the inside of my mouth nervously. My mum hadn\u2019t said a word to me since the wedding and at first, yeah, it hurt a lot. But I couldn\u2019t <i>not </i>speak to my mum. She was my mum! She couldn\u2019t just leave and not speak to me ever again. Could she?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re still thinking about it, aren\u2019t you?\u201c she asked, a hint of amusement in her voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed. \"Maybe.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Think about something else,\u201c she suggested. \"Food. Movies. Going back home. Anything else otherwise you\u2019re going to be upset the whole flight back.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sat up straight and held Brie\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I looked at her, smiling as I saw how cute she looked. She was wearing no makeup and her hair was pulled back into a little bun. She was wearing an oversized hoodie and she looked so comfy. I was a little jealous. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you thinking now?\u201c she asked, leaning on the armrest and meeting my eyes with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled wider. \"I\u2019m thinking about how cute you look. And also that I regret not bringing my own hoodie because you look <i>really</i> comfortable.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Her cheeks went pink as she shook her head. \u201cUh-uh. Eyes off. You\u2019re <i>not </i>getting my hoodie, Y/N. This one\u2019s my favourite.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I never asked for it,\u201c I defended, chuckling. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d she retorted, shaking her head still. \u201cEyes off.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I laughed now, leaning forward and giving her a haste kiss. \u201cI don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I can\u2019t believe you stole my hoodie when I was asleep,\u201c Brie mumbled, sulking as we grabbed our suitcases off the luggage carousel. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You shouldn\u2019t have taken it off,\u201d I pointed out, grinning. \u201cTotally your fault.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She narrowed her eyes at me, shaking her head distastefully. I laughed, pulling the sleeves over my hands comfortably. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Smells like you,\u201c I revelled in the scent. \"I love it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m right here!\u201c she said with raised eyebrows. \"Smell me, I don\u2019t care, but don\u2019t steal my hoodie!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I laughed as we walked away from the luggage carousel, away from the bustle of other people collecting their luggage. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You can have it back if you really want,\u201c I told her, giving her my best \u2018serious\u2019 look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stared at me curiously, before sighing with defeat. \"You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned, leaning forward and kissing her gently. When I pulled away, a hint of a smile was playing on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Right. Are you sure you\u2019ve got everything?\u201c she asked, her eyes scanning our luggage. \"Not left anything behind?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, doing a final check before looking at me, her expression softening. \u201cWe should say goodbye to Isaac and your mum.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My smile faded as I breathed out slowly. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She gave me an encouraging smile and intertwined her fingers with mine. I accepted her comfort and looked out to the luggage collection point, searching for either Isaac or my mum. I eventually saw them grabbing the last of their bags before they turned, heading our way. They hadn\u2019t seen us at first and I considered just leaving. But when Isaac looked up and gave me a bright smile, I knew I couldn\u2019t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You got this,\u201c Brie whispered as they stopped before us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled at her before looking to my mum, seeing she was looking to the floor. Great. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, girls, I guess this is where we depart ways,\u201d Isaac spoke first, looking between us. \u201cIt was a pleasure having you both at the wedding. And Brie,\u201d he looked to Brie, smiling appreciatively, \u201cyou\u2019re a lovely woman. It was an honour to meet you. I hope this isn\u2019t the last time. Especially now that you and Y/N are official.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie grinned. \u201cThank you for having me, Isaac. And I hope not either. Congratulations, once again.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac looked to me and I choked on my own words for a moment, until I felt Brie squeeze my hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you, Isaac,\u201c I finally got out, letting go of Brie and hugging him suddenly. \"For everything. I\u2019ll make sure to bug you with a call every week, yeah?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac chuckled, returning the hug. When we pulled away, I noticed his eyes were a little glassy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019d really like that, Y/N,\u201c he said, unable to stop smiling now. It warmed my heart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced at my mum, wondering if she was going to say anything. She was still staring at the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, Isaac, do you think you could help me do something?\u201d Brie suddenly spoke. \u201cOver, erm, over there?\u201d She nodded to the left and I realised what she was doing. So did Isaac, too, as he nodded enthusiastically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, of course,\u201c he said, and the two of them walked away to give my mum and I space. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum was still quiet though and I felt nervous, remembering how she walked away the last time we spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So is this it?\u201d I asked, grabbing her attention. \u201cWe just don\u2019t speak anymore?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, but didn\u2019t say anything. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to not speak to you, mum,\u201c I told her, frowning. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She sighed. \"I don\u2019t want to not speak either.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I felt my racing heart slow down a little. She was speaking. That was good, right?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Okay, well, what now?\u201c I asked. \"You want to yell at me? Because go for it! I don\u2019t care, you can embarrass me in front of Brie and Isaac and complete strangers. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She cracked a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not angry.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She shook her head. \u201cNo, Y/N. I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I widened my eyes, certainly not expecting that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You were right,\u201c she said, nodding. \"About what you said. I don\u2019t listen. I don\u2019t treat you fairly.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I didn\u2019t know what to say. She usually never listened to me and she was insanely stubborn, so this was different. She was acknowledging her actions and it was something I\u2019d only ever dreamed she would do. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re not a kid anymore,\u201c she continued. \"You have a life. And when you were a kid, you had to deal with me. You couldn\u2019t push me away. But now you\u2019re grown up and I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Mum, you\u2019ll never lose me,\u201c I said instantly, stepping forward and resting a hand on her forearm. \"Yeah, you piss me off at times, but that\u2019s just who you are. I\u2019m used to it. I still love you. I always will. I just wanted you to realise that sometimes your words hurt.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I get that now,\u201c she said, a tear slipping from her eye which she immediately wiped away. I was shocked at how this was affecting her. I didn\u2019t think she cared. \"I\u2019ll be kinder to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see that, honestly.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She rolled her eyes and smacked me on the shoulder playfully before pulling me in for a hug, which I happily accepted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m proud of you, Y/N,\u201c she said honestly, holding me at arm\u2019s length when we pulled away. \"I mean it. You\u2019re happy and I\u2019m glad. And Brie is wonderful. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re both together.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you,\u201c I said, smiling at her. \"I\u2019m sorry I lied at first.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I deserved it,\u201c she muttered, making me laugh. \"Look. I don\u2019t want us to be like before where I\u2019m lucky if I get a call every now and then.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ll visit you more. I\u2019ll call more. I promise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She smiled. \u201cGood\u2026 now I think we should wrap this up because Isaac and Brie are trying really hard to listen to what we\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced over my shoulder and suppressed a laugh when I saw the two of them pretending to have a conversation, but making it obvious they were listening in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We\u2019re all good, you guys can come back,\u201c I called to them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0They came back to us immediately, smiling hopefully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"All good?\u201d Brie asked quietly, looking at me with concerned eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled. \u201cAll good.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She smiled with relief, wrapping an arm around my waist. \u201cAwesome. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I guess this is goodbye for now,\u201c my mum said, grabbing our attention. She looked to Brie, smiling with gratitude. \"Brie, dear, thank you for attending our wedding. As Isaac said earlier, I hope we can see more of each other in the future.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie nodded, smiling politely. \u201cOf course, Y/M/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"First you guys should honeymoon it up,\u201c I said, looking between my mum and Isaac. \"Which reminds me, where are you guys going for your honeymoon?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"That\u2019s undecided,\u201c Isaac said, giving my mum a knowing look. \"Somebody can\u2019t make up her mind.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum waved her hand dismissively. \u201cOh, there\u2019s no rush! We have plenty of time to decide.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We all laughed and Brie nudged me gently, making me look at her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I know where you get your indecisiveness from now,\u201c she mumbled in my ear, making me glare at her playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Okay, girls, our taxi should be waiting for us, so we should really get going,\u201d Isaac said apologetically. \u201cAre you both okay for a ride or\u2026?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We\u2019ll be fine,\u201c I said, waving my hand. \"You guys go. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We look forward to it,\u201c my mum said, smiling with relief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We all exchanged hugs once more before bidding Isaac and my mum a goodbye. Brie and I also went our own way, managing to find a taxi to take us back to our flat. I felt so much more happier as we sat in the backseat, on our way home. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m really happy for you, Y/N,\u201d Brie said, squeezing my hand. \u201cYou did good.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled at her with adoration. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah you could\u2019ve,\u201c she said with certainty. \"You\u2019re strong. That\u2019s why I love you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I was a little surprised to hear her say that, and she must have realised what she said because her smile faded and any confidence she once had was now gone and replaced by nervousness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I- erm-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re honest,\u201d I cut her off, not breaking eye contact. \u201cThat\u2019s why <i>I </i>love <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She raised her eyebrows with surprise, but eventually a toothy smile broke out on her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I love you.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned. \"I love you, too, Brie.\u201d</p>",

I watched her, unable to stop grinning at the fact that we were actually <i>together</i> together. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was laughing, her eyes squinted adorably and her laugh lines portraying her happiness at this moment. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better sight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Watch, I can get this in my mouth,\u201c she said, sure of herself, her hazel eyes meeting mine. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just watch!\u201c she said, before setting her plate on the table and tossing an olive in the air. She opened her mouth to catch it, but of course she was way off and it hit her on the head before bouncing onto the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Ten out of ten,\u201d I said teasingly, to which she shoved me, almost making me drop my own plate.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can usually catch it,\u201c she said, pouting adorably. \"It\u2019s because you stared.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. \u201cOh, yeah, next time I\u2019ll be sure to close my eyes and believe you caught it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you,\u201c she said, grinning. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We continued to mess around by the appetisers, still stuffing ourselves with food, until we heard the music cut off and an announcement coming from the stage. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can everybody please come to the stage where the bride will be making a speech!\u201d a staff member said, his voice blasting through the speakers and to all the guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Brie with confusion. \u201cI thought speeches were done.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged, unsure herself, before taking my plate off me and setting it  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0on the table. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, I was eating that!\u201c I complained, about to pick it up again, but she stepped in the way and pushed me forward gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We gotta hear what your mum has to say,\u201d she said, smiling with amusement. \u201cFood after, I promise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed, but intertwined my fingers with hers, letting her lead me to the small crowd of guests that had formed. My mum was on the stage, standing in front of the mic. I noticed how she didn\u2019t seem even the tiniest bit nervous. She never was. I didn\u2019t understand how her and I could be so different from one another. If I was up there, I\u2019d probably faint. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"If I could have your attention please,\u201c she began, looking out at everyone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The chatter went quiet before a silence formed. All you could hear was the mic tuning and the sound of the waves on the beach in the distance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I know we already did speeches, but this is a little different,\u201d she said, her voice radiating confidence and certainty. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an announcement.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I waited patiently, wondering what she was going to say. I saw her glance to the left, at Isaac who was stood offstage but smiling encouragingly at her. She looked back to everyone before continuing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"As you all know, today has been a massive step forward in my personal life,\u201c she explained, a smile on her lips. \"It\u2019s a change I have welcomed with open arms and it\u2019s only made me realise that there\u2019s other aspects of my life that I wish to move forward with.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows with confusion. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Most of you here are friends and colleagues of mine,\u201c she said, nodding. \"I\u2019m grateful for all you of. Meeting so many people in my line of work is something I anticipated. Being a lawyer and having my own firm is something I am thankful for. But I\u2019ve come to a point now where I realise that it\u2019s a chapter of my life I\u2019m ready to finish.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I raised my eyebrows as everyone began to mutter between one another. I recalled what Naomi said about her giving away the firm, but I never realised it could actually be true. Is that what she was going to announce?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked around, trying to see if Naomi and Kieran were here when finally, I caught Naomi\u2019s glare from across the crowd. She was fuming, her arms crossed and her brother shaking his head with annoyance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, you okay?\u201c Brie asked quietly, squeezing my hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I met her eyes. \"I, erm, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She cocked her head to the side questioningly, but she didn\u2019t get to say anything because my mum was speaking again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It took a lot of planning, but I have decided to give my firm away,\u201c she announced, everyone\u2019s eyes on her. Her eyes scanned the crowd before they met mine. \"Y/N, I want to give it to you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I gulped down the lump in my throat as everybody turned to look at me. I suddenly felt really warm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Now, you\u2019ve made it very clear that you don\u2019t want to be a lawyer,\u201c my mum said, a bit of sourness still present in her voice that only I could detect from the millions of times she\u2019d said that to me, \"but this is different. You can sell the firm if you want. Or manage it. The possibilities are endless. I just want you to have it. It should stay in the family.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out, pursing my lips. People were looking between my mum and I, expecting one of us to say something else. Even Brie was surprised, her eyes boring into the side of my head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, honey?\u201c my mum spoke, a flicker of confusion crossing her expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I finally found my words. \"Mum, I can\u2019t accept.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard people gasp around me, mumbling between each other as they looked me up and down judgementally. Any one of these people would snap up the opportunity to buy this firm - it made millions. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Erm, what was that?\u201c my mum asked, her smile forced now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I shook my head, speaking louder. \"No, thank you!\u201d All eyes were on me and I tried to focus. Brie smiled encouragingly and I remembered what I wanted to say as I looked back to my mum. \u201cIt should stay in the family, yes, but it should go to Naomi and Kieran!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked to my cousins, seeing the shock on their faces. My mum seemed speechless for one of the first times in my life. I didn\u2019t want the firm. I didn\u2019t need it. Yes, I could probably make a fortune like my mum, but that\u2019s not what I wanted. I had everything I needed. Plus, as annoying as Naomi and Kieran were, they had worked hard and deserved the firm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I see,\u201c my mum finally spoke, earning everyone\u2019s attention. Her signature business-meeting smile was back on her face as she said, \"The firm shall be passed down to my lovely niece and nephew, Naomi and Kieran.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Nobody knew what to do at first, but then somebody started to clap and everyone joined in, cheering for the siblings and moving their way to congratulate them. I breathed out with relief and tried to ignore the glare coming from my mother. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Food?\u201c I asked Brie, wanting nothing more than for her to drag me away from the inevitable yelling I was about to get. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Er, I think your mum wants you,\u201d she said, looking a little frightened when she pointed over my shoulder.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, sighing to myself, before turning around and seeing her stood with Isaac offstage, motioning for me to come to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You said you wouldn\u2019t leave me alone,\u201c I told Brie, before dragging her along with me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The two of us approached my mum and Isaac and she did <i>not </i>look happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, I need to speak with you privately,\u201d she said, containing her annoyance as best as she could whilst her eyes flickered to Brie. \u201cIt\u2019s a family matter.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Brie is part of the family, as you\u2019ve said countless of times,\u201c I pointed out, not letting go of Brie\u2019s hand. \"Whatever you say to me can be said in front of her.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum breathed out before nodding. \u201cFine. Care to explain why you embarrassed me up there like that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Now, Y/M/N, that\u2019s not what you said you would say,\u201c Isaac spoke up before I could. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum clenched her jaw before nodding. I looked at Isaac gratefully, who\u00a0smiled apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Why don\u2019t you want the firm, Y/N?\u201d she rephrased, less aggressively. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I didn\u2019t ask for it,\u201c I said calmly. \"I don\u2019t need it. I already have everything I need.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You didn\u2019t need to ask for it,\u201c she said, shaking her head. \"You\u2019re my only child. It\u2019s a family firm. <i>You\u2019re </i>my family.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So are Naomi and Kieran,\u201c I stated. \"And they really wanted it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You don\u2019t even like them!\u201c she shouted quietly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/M/N\u2026\u201d Isaac reminded her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry,\u201c she mumbled, before looking to me. \"I never thought you would advocate for them when you\u2019ve made it very clear how you feel about them.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I know I say stuff, but at the end of the day, they deserve the firm more than I. You\u2019re giving it to me out of obligation. They actually <i>want</i> to make use of it. They can continue your work with their talent and your name. You chose me over them because of this false sense of pride you have for me.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Her expression softened. \"I <i>am </i>proud of you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled sadly. \u201cWhy? Because I now have a girlfriend? I\u2019m still the same person, mum. Still a school councillor. Still living in a flat. Still not going to the gym, or buying designer clothes. I\u2019m still me. Except I have a girlfriend who just happens to be famous. What\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stayed silent, looking between Brie and I. Isaac watched me, nodding his head as a proud smile appeared on his lips. I felt recognised for a change. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I shouldn\u2019t have come here under these circumstances,\u201c I admitted. \"Brie and I weren\u2019t together, okay?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It\u2019s okay, Brie,\u201d I said, letting go of her hand as I smiled confidently at her. I looked back to my mum, who was surprised. \u201cWe weren\u2019t together. You assumed we were together because you didn\u2019t listen, mum. You <i>never </i>listen. I faked it. It started off as a way to make you proud, but I know I can never do that. Then it turned into me proving a point. But now I know none of that matters.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So, what, this is fake?\u201c was all she could ask, motioning to the two of us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I shook my head. \"It was very much real. Just not in the way you thought. And we\u2019re together now. That\u2019s one of the few amazing things to come out of this whole thing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out as my mum avoided my eyes, her expression unreadable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Not so proud anymore, right?\u201c I asked, cracking a sad smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N\u2026\u201d Isaac began, before staying quiet. He could only speak for himself, and I didn\u2019t want to hear from him right now. I wanted to hear from the one person who wasn\u2019t saying anything to me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I love you, mum, but I deserve to be treated right, despite my personal relationships and life choices,\u201c I said, finally believing my words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0It was quiet for way too long, at least that\u2019s what it felt like. She wasn\u2019t even looking at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you for coming,\u201d she finally said, but she didn\u2019t look my way as she walked away from us all. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, sighing to myself. I tried not to get my hopes up with her, but this time I really thought\u2026 I thought she would at least acknowledge my words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"She\u2019s going to come around,\u201c Isaac said, and I opened my eyes to see him moving forward and pulling me in for a hug. I returned the hug, frowning a little. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"She won\u2019t,\u201d I said, sure of myself. We pulled away and I said, \u201cThank you, though.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He smiled sadly. \u201cI should go and check on her\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded and he walked away. I pinched the bridge of my nose, tilting my head back as I willed a tear to go back into my eye. After a moment, I let go and turned around to see Brie smiling sadly at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry that didn\u2019t go how it should have,\u201c she said softly, stepping forward and taking my hand, holding it between both of hers, \"but I\u2019m really proud of you for telling the truth. All of it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I felt my throat closing up horribly, a familiar feeling I always felt before I cried. I shook my head, willing myself to hold it in. \u201cI thought\u2026 I thought telling the truth was supposed to hurt a lot less.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I knew my mum was like this, so why was I surprised? She\u2019d said horrible things to me in the past, but I didn\u2019t know her saying nothing would hurt so much more. My heart ached. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m so sorry, Y/N,\u201c Brie said, pulling me close to her, and I closed my eyes, tucking my head into her shoulder as she held me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t cry - I couldn\u2019t, not here, not now. I felt silly. But Brie comforted me anyway, rubbing soothing circles on my back as I tried to ignore the pain in my chest. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I breathed out with relief as I settled into the aeroplane seat. Brie and I were on our flight back to L.A and one of my least favourite things was getting through airport security. Thankfully though, we were in first class (because of my mum\u2019s pre-paid tickets) so the seats were super comfortable. <i>Un</i>fortunately, my mum was on the same plane as us, so I still had to see her and Isaac off when we landed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Stop thinking about it,\u201d Brie said, pulling me from my thoughts. I glanced at her seat beside me and she was giving me a knowing smile. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I can\u2019t help it,\u201c I said, shrugging my shoulders. I leaned on her shoulder, cuddling into her arm. \"She\u2019s not speaking to me, Brie. It\u2019s been more than 24 hours.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie pressed a kiss to the top of my head before leaning on me, too. \u201cShe\u2019ll come around. Isaac said so himself.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I said nothing as I chewed the inside of my mouth nervously. My mum hadn\u2019t said a word to me since the wedding and at first, yeah, it hurt a lot. But I couldn\u2019t <i>not </i>speak to my mum. She was my mum! She couldn\u2019t just leave and not speak to me ever again. Could she?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re still thinking about it, aren\u2019t you?\u201c she asked, a hint of amusement in her voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed. \"Maybe.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Think about something else,\u201c she suggested. \"Food. Movies. Going back home. Anything else otherwise you\u2019re going to be upset the whole flight back.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sat up straight and held Brie\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I looked at her, smiling as I saw how cute she looked. She was wearing no makeup and her hair was pulled back into a little bun. She was wearing an oversized hoodie and she looked so comfy. I was a little jealous. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you thinking now?\u201c she asked, leaning on the armrest and meeting my eyes with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled wider. \"I\u2019m thinking about how cute you look. And also that I regret not bringing my own hoodie because you look <i>really</i> comfortable.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Her cheeks went pink as she shook her head. \u201cUh-uh. Eyes off. You\u2019re <i>not </i>getting my hoodie, Y/N. This one\u2019s my favourite.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I never asked for it,\u201c I defended, chuckling. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d she retorted, shaking her head still. \u201cEyes off.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I laughed now, leaning forward and giving her a haste kiss. \u201cI don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I can\u2019t believe you stole my hoodie when I was asleep,\u201c Brie mumbled, sulking as we grabbed our suitcases off the luggage carousel. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You shouldn\u2019t have taken it off,\u201d I pointed out, grinning. \u201cTotally your fault.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She narrowed her eyes at me, shaking her head distastefully. I laughed, pulling the sleeves over my hands comfortably. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Smells like you,\u201c I revelled in the scent. \"I love it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m right here!\u201c she said with raised eyebrows. \"Smell me, I don\u2019t care, but don\u2019t steal my hoodie!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I laughed as we walked away from the luggage carousel, away from the bustle of other people collecting their luggage. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You can have it back if you really want,\u201c I told her, giving her my best \u2018serious\u2019 look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stared at me curiously, before sighing with defeat. \"You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned, leaning forward and kissing her gently. When I pulled away, a hint of a smile was playing on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Right. Are you sure you\u2019ve got everything?\u201c she asked, her eyes scanning our luggage. \"Not left anything behind?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, doing a final check before looking at me, her expression softening. \u201cWe should say goodbye to Isaac and your mum.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My smile faded as I breathed out slowly. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She gave me an encouraging smile and intertwined her fingers with mine. I accepted her comfort and looked out to the luggage collection point, searching for either Isaac or my mum. I eventually saw them grabbing the last of their bags before they turned, heading our way. They hadn\u2019t seen us at first and I considered just leaving. But when Isaac looked up and gave me a bright smile, I knew I couldn\u2019t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You got this,\u201c Brie whispered as they stopped before us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled at her before looking to my mum, seeing she was looking to the floor. Great. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, girls, I guess this is where we depart ways,\u201d Isaac spoke first, looking between us. \u201cIt was a pleasure having you both at the wedding. And Brie,\u201d he looked to Brie, smiling appreciatively, \u201cyou\u2019re a lovely woman. It was an honour to meet you. I hope this isn\u2019t the last time. Especially now that you and Y/N are official.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie grinned. \u201cThank you for having me, Isaac. And I hope not either. Congratulations, once again.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac looked to me and I choked on my own words for a moment, until I felt Brie squeeze my hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you, Isaac,\u201c I finally got out, letting go of Brie and hugging him suddenly. \"For everything. I\u2019ll make sure to bug you with a call every week, yeah?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac chuckled, returning the hug. When we pulled away, I noticed his eyes were a little glassy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019d really like that, Y/N,\u201c he said, unable to stop smiling now. It warmed my heart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced at my mum, wondering if she was going to say anything. She was still staring at the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, Isaac, do you think you could help me do something?\u201d Brie suddenly spoke. \u201cOver, erm, over there?\u201d She nodded to the left and I realised what she was doing. So did Isaac, too, as he nodded enthusiastically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, of course,\u201c he said, and the two of them walked away to give my mum and I space. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum was still quiet though and I felt nervous, remembering how she walked away the last time we spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So is this it?\u201d I asked, grabbing her attention. \u201cWe just don\u2019t speak anymore?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, but didn\u2019t say anything. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to not speak to you, mum,\u201c I told her, frowning. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She sighed. \"I don\u2019t want to not speak either.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I felt my racing heart slow down a little. She was speaking. That was good, right?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Okay, well, what now?\u201c I asked. \"You want to yell at me? Because go for it! I don\u2019t care, you can embarrass me in front of Brie and Isaac and complete strangers. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She cracked a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not angry.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She shook her head. \u201cNo, Y/N. I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I widened my eyes, certainly not expecting that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You were right,\u201c she said, nodding. \"About what you said. I don\u2019t listen. I don\u2019t treat you fairly.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I didn\u2019t know what to say. She usually never listened to me and she was insanely stubborn, so this was different. She was acknowledging her actions and it was something I\u2019d only ever dreamed she would do. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re not a kid anymore,\u201c she continued. \"You have a life. And when you were a kid, you had to deal with me. You couldn\u2019t push me away. But now you\u2019re grown up and I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Mum, you\u2019ll never lose me,\u201c I said instantly, stepping forward and resting a hand on her forearm. \"Yeah, you piss me off at times, but that\u2019s just who you are. I\u2019m used to it. I still love you. I always will. I just wanted you to realise that sometimes your words hurt.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I get that now,\u201c she said, a tear slipping from her eye which she immediately wiped away. I was shocked at how this was affecting her. I didn\u2019t think she cared. \"I\u2019ll be kinder to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see that, honestly.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She rolled her eyes and smacked me on the shoulder playfully before pulling me in for a hug, which I happily accepted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m proud of you, Y/N,\u201c she said honestly, holding me at arm\u2019s length when we pulled away. \"I mean it. You\u2019re happy and I\u2019m glad. And Brie is wonderful. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re both together.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you,\u201c I said, smiling at her. \"I\u2019m sorry I lied at first.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I deserved it,\u201c she muttered, making me laugh. \"Look. I don\u2019t want us to be like before where I\u2019m lucky if I get a call every now and then.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ll visit you more. I\u2019ll call more. I promise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She smiled. \u201cGood\u2026 now I think we should wrap this up because Isaac and Brie are trying really hard to listen to what we\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced over my shoulder and suppressed a laugh when I saw the two of them pretending to have a conversation, but making it obvious they were listening in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We\u2019re all good, you guys can come back,\u201c I called to them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0They came back to us immediately, smiling hopefully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"All good?\u201d Brie asked quietly, looking at me with concerned eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled. \u201cAll good.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She smiled with relief, wrapping an arm around my waist. \u201cAwesome. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I guess this is goodbye for now,\u201c my mum said, grabbing our attention. She looked to Brie, smiling with gratitude. \"Brie, dear, thank you for attending our wedding. As Isaac said earlier, I hope we can see more of each other in the future.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie nodded, smiling politely. \u201cOf course, Y/M/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"First you guys should honeymoon it up,\u201c I said, looking between my mum and Isaac. \"Which reminds me, where are you guys going for your honeymoon?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"That\u2019s undecided,\u201c Isaac said, giving my mum a knowing look. \"Somebody can\u2019t make up her mind.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum waved her hand dismissively. \u201cOh, there\u2019s no rush! We have plenty of time to decide.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We all laughed and Brie nudged me gently, making me look at her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I know where you get your indecisiveness from now,\u201c she mumbled in my ear, making me glare at her playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Okay, girls, our taxi should be waiting for us, so we should really get going,\u201d Isaac said apologetically. \u201cAre you both okay for a ride or\u2026?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We\u2019ll be fine,\u201c I said, waving my hand. \"You guys go. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We look forward to it,\u201c my mum said, smiling with relief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We all exchanged hugs once more before bidding Isaac and my mum a goodbye. Brie and I also went our own way, managing to find a taxi to take us back to our flat. I felt so much more happier as we sat in the backseat, on our way home. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m really happy for you, Y/N,\u201d Brie said, squeezing my hand. \u201cYou did good.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled at her with adoration. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah you could\u2019ve,\u201c she said with certainty. \"You\u2019re strong. That\u2019s why I love you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I was a little surprised to hear her say that, and she must have realised what she said because her smile faded and any confidence she once had was now gone and replaced by nervousness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I- erm-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re honest,\u201d I cut her off, not breaking eye contact. \u201cThat\u2019s why <i>I </i>love <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She raised her eyebrows with surprise, but eventually a toothy smile broke out on her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I love you.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned. \"I love you, too, Brie.\u201d</p>",

I watched her, unable to stop grinning at the fact that we were actually <i>together</i> together. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was laughing, her eyes squinted adorably and her laugh lines portraying her happiness at this moment. I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better sight. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Watch, I can get this in my mouth,&ldquo; she said, sure of herself, her hazel eyes meeting mine. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Just watch!&ldquo; she said, before setting her plate on the table and tossing an olive in the air. She opened her mouth to catch it, but of course she was way off and it hit her on the head before bouncing onto the floor. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Ten out of ten,&rdquo; I said teasingly, to which she shoved me, almost making me drop my own plate.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I can usually catch it,&ldquo; she said, pouting adorably. \"It&rsquo;s because you stared.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed. &ldquo;Oh, yeah, next time I&rsquo;ll be sure to close my eyes and believe you caught it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thank you,&ldquo; she said, grinning. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We continued to mess around by the appetisers, still stuffing ourselves with food, until we heard the music cut off and an announcement coming from the stage. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Can everybody please come to the stage where the bride will be making a speech!&rdquo; a staff member said, his voice blasting through the speakers and to all the guests. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked to Brie with confusion. &ldquo;I thought speeches were done.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shrugged, unsure herself, before taking my plate off me and setting it  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the table. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey, I was eating that!&ldquo; I complained, about to pick it up again, but she stepped in the way and pushed me forward gently. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"We gotta hear what your mum has to say,&rdquo; she said, smiling with amusement. &ldquo;Food after, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I sighed, but intertwined my fingers with hers, letting her lead me to the small crowd of guests that had formed. My mum was on the stage, standing in front of the mic. I noticed how she didn&rsquo;t seem even the tiniest bit nervous. She never was. I didn&rsquo;t understand how her and I could be so different from one another. If I was up there, I&rsquo;d probably faint. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"If I could have your attention please,&ldquo; she began, looking out at everyone. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The chatter went quiet before a silence formed. All you could hear was the mic tuning and the sound of the waves on the beach in the distance. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I know we already did speeches, but this is a little different,&rdquo; she said, her voice radiating confidence and certainty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of an announcement.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I waited patiently, wondering what she was going to say. I saw her glance to the left, at Isaac who was stood offstage but smiling encouragingly at her. She looked back to everyone before continuing. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"As you all know, today has been a massive step forward in my personal life,&ldquo; she explained, a smile on her lips. \"It&rsquo;s a change I have welcomed with open arms and it&rsquo;s only made me realise that there&rsquo;s other aspects of my life that I wish to move forward with.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I furrowed my eyebrows with confusion. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Most of you here are friends and colleagues of mine,&ldquo; she said, nodding. \"I&rsquo;m grateful for all you of. Meeting so many people in my line of work is something I anticipated. Being a lawyer and having my own firm is something I am thankful for. But I&rsquo;ve come to a point now where I realise that it&rsquo;s a chapter of my life I&rsquo;m ready to finish.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I raised my eyebrows as everyone began to mutter between one another. I recalled what Naomi said about her giving away the firm, but I never realised it could actually be true. Is that what she was going to announce?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I looked around, trying to see if Naomi and Kieran were here when finally, I caught Naomi&rsquo;s glare from across the crowd. She was fuming, her arms crossed and her brother shaking his head with annoyance. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Hey, you okay?&ldquo; Brie asked quietly, squeezing my hand. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I met her eyes. \"I, erm, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She cocked her head to the side questioningly, but she didn&rsquo;t get to say anything because my mum was speaking again. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"It took a lot of planning, but I have decided to give my firm away,&ldquo; she announced, everyone&rsquo;s eyes on her. Her eyes scanned the crowd before they met mine. \"Y/N, I want to give it to you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I gulped down the lump in my throat as everybody turned to look at me. I suddenly felt really warm. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Now, you&rsquo;ve made it very clear that you don&rsquo;t want to be a lawyer,&ldquo; my mum said, a bit of sourness still present in her voice that only I could detect from the millions of times she&rsquo;d said that to me, \"but this is different. You can sell the firm if you want. Or manage it. The possibilities are endless. I just want you to have it. It should stay in the family.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I breathed out, pursing my lips. People were looking between my mum and I, expecting one of us to say something else. Even Brie was surprised, her eyes boring into the side of my head. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well, honey?&ldquo; my mum spoke, a flicker of confusion crossing her expression. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I finally found my words. \"Mum, I can&rsquo;t accept.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I heard people gasp around me, mumbling between each other as they looked me up and down judgementally. Any one of these people would snap up the opportunity to buy this firm - it made millions. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Erm, what was that?&ldquo; my mum asked, her smile forced now. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head, speaking louder. \"No, thank you!&rdquo; All eyes were on me and I tried to focus. Brie smiled encouragingly and I remembered what I wanted to say as I looked back to my mum. &ldquo;It should stay in the family, yes, but it should go to Naomi and Kieran!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I looked to my cousins, seeing the shock on their faces. My mum seemed speechless for one of the first times in my life. I didn&rsquo;t want the firm. I didn&rsquo;t need it. Yes, I could probably make a fortune like my mum, but that&rsquo;s not what I wanted. I had everything I needed. Plus, as annoying as Naomi and Kieran were, they had worked hard and deserved the firm. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I see,&ldquo; my mum finally spoke, earning everyone&rsquo;s attention. Her signature business-meeting smile was back on her face as she said, \"The firm shall be passed down to my lovely niece and nephew, Naomi and Kieran.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knew what to do at first, but then somebody started to clap and everyone joined in, cheering for the siblings and moving their way to congratulate them. I breathed out with relief and tried to ignore the glare coming from my mother. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Food?&ldquo; I asked Brie, wanting nothing more than for her to drag me away from the inevitable yelling I was about to get. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Er, I think your mum wants you,&rdquo; she said, looking a little frightened when she pointed over my shoulder.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I closed my eyes, sighing to myself, before turning around and seeing her stood with Isaac offstage, motioning for me to come to her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You said you wouldn&rsquo;t leave me alone,&ldquo; I told Brie, before dragging her along with me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two of us approached my mum and Isaac and she did <i>not </i>look happy. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N, I need to speak with you privately,&rdquo; she said, containing her annoyance as best as she could whilst her eyes flickered to Brie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a family matter.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Brie is part of the family, as you&rsquo;ve said countless of times,&ldquo; I pointed out, not letting go of Brie&rsquo;s hand. \"Whatever you say to me can be said in front of her.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum breathed out before nodding. &ldquo;Fine. Care to explain why you embarrassed me up there like that?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Now, Y/M/N, that&rsquo;s not what you said you would say,&ldquo; Isaac spoke up before I could. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum clenched her jaw before nodding. I looked at Isaac gratefully, who&nbsp;smiled apologetically. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Why don&rsquo;t you want the firm, Y/N?&rdquo; she rephrased, less aggressively. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I didn&rsquo;t ask for it,&ldquo; I said calmly. \"I don&rsquo;t need it. I already have everything I need.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You didn&rsquo;t need to ask for it,&ldquo; she said, shaking her head. \"You&rsquo;re my only child. It&rsquo;s a family firm. <i>You&rsquo;re </i>my family.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"So are Naomi and Kieran,&ldquo; I stated. \"And they really wanted it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You don&rsquo;t even like them!&ldquo; she shouted quietly.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/M/N&hellip;&rdquo; Isaac reminded her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sorry,&ldquo; she mumbled, before looking to me. \"I never thought you would advocate for them when you&rsquo;ve made it very clear how you feel about them.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I know I say stuff, but at the end of the day, they deserve the firm more than I. You&rsquo;re giving it to me out of obligation. They actually <i>want</i> to make use of it. They can continue your work with their talent and your name. You chose me over them because of this false sense of pride you have for me.&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Her expression softened. \"I <i>am </i>proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled sadly. &ldquo;Why? Because I now have a girlfriend? I&rsquo;m still the same person, mum. Still a school councillor. Still living in a flat. Still not going to the gym, or buying designer clothes. I&rsquo;m still me. Except I have a girlfriend who just happens to be famous. What&rsquo;s changed?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She stayed silent, looking between Brie and I. Isaac watched me, nodding his head as a proud smile appeared on his lips. I felt recognised for a change. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I shouldn&rsquo;t have come here under these circumstances,&ldquo; I admitted. \"Brie and I weren&rsquo;t together, okay?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N-&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"It&rsquo;s okay, Brie,&rdquo; I said, letting go of her hand as I smiled confidently at her. I looked back to my mum, who was surprised. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t together. You assumed we were together because you didn&rsquo;t listen, mum. You <i>never </i>listen. I faked it. It started off as a way to make you proud, but I know I can never do that. Then it turned into me proving a point. But now I know none of that matters.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"So, what, this is fake?&ldquo; was all she could ask, motioning to the two of us. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head. \"It was very much real. Just not in the way you thought. And we&rsquo;re together now. That&rsquo;s one of the few amazing things to come out of this whole thing.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I breathed out as my mum avoided my eyes, her expression unreadable. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Not so proud anymore, right?&ldquo; I asked, cracking a sad smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; Isaac began, before staying quiet. He could only speak for himself, and I didn&rsquo;t want to hear from him right now. I wanted to hear from the one person who wasn&rsquo;t saying anything to me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I love you, mum, but I deserve to be treated right, despite my personal relationships and life choices,&ldquo; I said, finally believing my words. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was quiet for way too long, at least that&rsquo;s what it felt like. She wasn&rsquo;t even looking at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thank you for coming,&rdquo; she finally said, but she didn&rsquo;t look my way as she walked away from us all. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I closed my eyes, sighing to myself. I tried not to get my hopes up with her, but this time I really thought&hellip; I thought she would at least acknowledge my words. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"She&rsquo;s going to come around,&ldquo; Isaac said, and I opened my eyes to see him moving forward and pulling me in for a hug. I returned the hug, frowning a little. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"She won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, sure of myself. We pulled away and I said, &ldquo;Thank you, though.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled sadly. &ldquo;I should go and check on her&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded and he walked away. I pinched the bridge of my nose, tilting my head back as I willed a tear to go back into my eye. After a moment, I let go and turned around to see Brie smiling sadly at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m sorry that didn&rsquo;t go how it should have,&ldquo; she said softly, stepping forward and taking my hand, holding it between both of hers, \"but I&rsquo;m really proud of you for telling the truth. All of it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I felt my throat closing up horribly, a familiar feeling I always felt before I cried. I shook my head, willing myself to hold it in. &ldquo;I thought&hellip; I thought telling the truth was supposed to hurt a lot less.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I knew my mum was like this, so why was I surprised? She&rsquo;d said horrible things to me in the past, but I didn&rsquo;t know her saying nothing would hurt so much more. My heart ached. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m so sorry, Y/N,&ldquo; Brie said, pulling me close to her, and I closed my eyes, tucking my head into her shoulder as she held me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t cry - I couldn&rsquo;t, not here, not now. I felt silly. But Brie comforted me anyway, rubbing soothing circles on my back as I tried to ignore the pain in my chest. </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I breathed out with relief as I settled into the aeroplane seat. Brie and I were on our flight back to L.A and one of my least favourite things was getting through airport security. Thankfully though, we were in first class (because of my mum&rsquo;s pre-paid tickets) so the seats were super comfortable. <i>Un</i>fortunately, my mum was on the same plane as us, so I still had to see her and Isaac off when we landed. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Stop thinking about it,&rdquo; Brie said, pulling me from my thoughts. I glanced at her seat beside me and she was giving me a knowing smile. &ldquo;I can tell you&rsquo;re thinking about it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I can&rsquo;t help it,&ldquo; I said, shrugging my shoulders. I leaned on her shoulder, cuddling into her arm. \"She&rsquo;s not speaking to me, Brie. It&rsquo;s been more than 24 hours.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie pressed a kiss to the top of my head before leaning on me, too. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come around. Isaac said so himself.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so I said nothing as I chewed the inside of my mouth nervously. My mum hadn&rsquo;t said a word to me since the wedding and at first, yeah, it hurt a lot. But I couldn&rsquo;t <i>not </i>speak to my mum. She was my mum! She couldn&rsquo;t just leave and not speak to me ever again. Could she?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re still thinking about it, aren&rsquo;t you?&ldquo; she asked, a hint of amusement in her voice. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I sighed. \"Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Think about something else,&ldquo; she suggested. \"Food. Movies. Going back home. Anything else otherwise you&rsquo;re going to be upset the whole flight back.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I sat up straight and held Brie&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; I looked at her, smiling as I saw how cute she looked. She was wearing no makeup and her hair was pulled back into a little bun. She was wearing an oversized hoodie and she looked so comfy. I was a little jealous. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you thinking now?&ldquo; she asked, leaning on the armrest and meeting my eyes with a smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled wider. \"I&rsquo;m thinking about how cute you look. And also that I regret not bringing my own hoodie because you look <i>really</i> comfortable.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Her cheeks went pink as she shook her head. &ldquo;Uh-uh. Eyes off. You&rsquo;re <i>not </i>getting my hoodie, Y/N. This one&rsquo;s my favourite.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I never asked for it,&ldquo; I defended, chuckling. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; she retorted, shaking her head still. &ldquo;Eyes off.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I laughed now, leaning forward and giving her a haste kiss. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I can&rsquo;t believe you stole my hoodie when I was asleep,&ldquo; Brie mumbled, sulking as we grabbed our suitcases off the luggage carousel. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You shouldn&rsquo;t have taken it off,&rdquo; I pointed out, grinning. &ldquo;Totally your fault.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She narrowed her eyes at me, shaking her head distastefully. I laughed, pulling the sleeves over my hands comfortably. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Smells like you,&ldquo; I revelled in the scent. \"I love it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m right here!&ldquo; she said with raised eyebrows. \"Smell me, I don&rsquo;t care, but don&rsquo;t steal my hoodie!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I laughed as we walked away from the luggage carousel, away from the bustle of other people collecting their luggage. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You can have it back if you really want,&ldquo; I told her, giving her my best &lsquo;serious&rsquo; look. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at me curiously, before sighing with defeat. \"You&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I grinned, leaning forward and kissing her gently. When I pulled away, a hint of a smile was playing on her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Right. Are you sure you&rsquo;ve got everything?&ldquo; she asked, her eyes scanning our luggage. \"Not left anything behind?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded, doing a final check before looking at me, her expression softening. &ldquo;We should say goodbye to Isaac and your mum.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My smile faded as I breathed out slowly. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She gave me an encouraging smile and intertwined her fingers with mine. I accepted her comfort and looked out to the luggage collection point, searching for either Isaac or my mum. I eventually saw them grabbing the last of their bags before they turned, heading our way. They hadn&rsquo;t seen us at first and I considered just leaving. But when Isaac looked up and gave me a bright smile, I knew I couldn&rsquo;t. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You got this,&ldquo; Brie whispered as they stopped before us. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled at her before looking to my mum, seeing she was looking to the floor. Great. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well, girls, I guess this is where we depart ways,&rdquo; Isaac spoke first, looking between us. &ldquo;It was a pleasure having you both at the wedding. And Brie,&rdquo; he looked to Brie, smiling appreciatively, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a lovely woman. It was an honour to meet you. I hope this isn&rsquo;t the last time. Especially now that you and Y/N are official.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie grinned. &ldquo;Thank you for having me, Isaac. And I hope not either. Congratulations, once again.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac looked to me and I choked on my own words for a moment, until I felt Brie squeeze my hand. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thank you, Isaac,&ldquo; I finally got out, letting go of Brie and hugging him suddenly. \"For everything. I&rsquo;ll make sure to bug you with a call every week, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac chuckled, returning the hug. When we pulled away, I noticed his eyes were a little glassy. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;d really like that, Y/N,&ldquo; he said, unable to stop smiling now. It warmed my heart. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I glanced at my mum, wondering if she was going to say anything. She was still staring at the floor. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Hey, Isaac, do you think you could help me do something?&rdquo; Brie suddenly spoke. &ldquo;Over, erm, over there?&rdquo; She nodded to the left and I realised what she was doing. So did Isaac, too, as he nodded enthusiastically. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Yes, of course,&ldquo; he said, and the two of them walked away to give my mum and I space. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum was still quiet though and I felt nervous, remembering how she walked away the last time we spoke. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"So is this it?&rdquo; I asked, grabbing her attention. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t speak anymore?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She pursed her lips, but didn&rsquo;t say anything. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I don&rsquo;t want to not speak to you, mum,&ldquo; I told her, frowning. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed. \"I don&rsquo;t want to not speak either.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I felt my racing heart slow down a little. She was speaking. That was good, right?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Okay, well, what now?&ldquo; I asked. \"You want to yell at me? Because go for it! I don&rsquo;t care, you can embarrass me in front of Brie and Isaac and complete strangers. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She cracked a small smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip; I&rsquo;m not angry.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I furrowed my eyebrows. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head. &ldquo;No, Y/N. I&rsquo;m just&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I widened my eyes, certainly not expecting that. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You were right,&ldquo; she said, nodding. \"About what you said. I don&rsquo;t listen. I don&rsquo;t treat you fairly.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. She usually never listened to me and she was insanely stubborn, so this was different. She was acknowledging her actions and it was something I&rsquo;d only ever dreamed she would do. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re not a kid anymore,&ldquo; she continued. \"You have a life. And when you were a kid, you had to deal with me. You couldn&rsquo;t push me away. But now you&rsquo;re grown up and I don&rsquo;t want to lose you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mum, you&rsquo;ll never lose me,&ldquo; I said instantly, stepping forward and resting a hand on her forearm. \"Yeah, you piss me off at times, but that&rsquo;s just who you are. I&rsquo;m used to it. I still love you. I always will. I just wanted you to realise that sometimes your words hurt.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I get that now,&ldquo; she said, a tear slipping from her eye which she immediately wiped away. I was shocked at how this was affecting her. I didn&rsquo;t think she cared. \"I&rsquo;ll be kinder to you, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see that, honestly.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She rolled her eyes and smacked me on the shoulder playfully before pulling me in for a hug, which I happily accepted. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m proud of you, Y/N,&ldquo; she said honestly, holding me at arm&rsquo;s length when we pulled away. \"I mean it. You&rsquo;re happy and I&rsquo;m glad. And Brie is wonderful. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re both together.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thank you,&ldquo; I said, smiling at her. \"I&rsquo;m sorry I lied at first.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I deserved it,&ldquo; she muttered, making me laugh. \"Look. I don&rsquo;t want us to be like before where I&rsquo;m lucky if I get a call every now and then.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded in agreement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll visit you more. I&rsquo;ll call more. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled. &ldquo;Good&hellip; now I think we should wrap this up because Isaac and Brie are trying really hard to listen to what we&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I glanced over my shoulder and suppressed a laugh when I saw the two of them pretending to have a conversation, but making it obvious they were listening in. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"We&rsquo;re all good, you guys can come back,&ldquo; I called to them. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They came back to us immediately, smiling hopefully. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"All good?&rdquo; Brie asked quietly, looking at me with concerned eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled. &ldquo;All good.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled with relief, wrapping an arm around my waist. &ldquo;Awesome. I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I guess this is goodbye for now,&ldquo; my mum said, grabbing our attention. She looked to Brie, smiling with gratitude. \"Brie, dear, thank you for attending our wedding. As Isaac said earlier, I hope we can see more of each other in the future.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie nodded, smiling politely. &ldquo;Of course, Y/M/N.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"First you guys should honeymoon it up,&ldquo; I said, looking between my mum and Isaac. \"Which reminds me, where are you guys going for your honeymoon?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"That&rsquo;s undecided,&ldquo; Isaac said, giving my mum a knowing look. \"Somebody can&rsquo;t make up her mind.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum waved her hand dismissively. &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no rush! We have plenty of time to decide.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We all laughed and Brie nudged me gently, making me look at her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I know where you get your indecisiveness from now,&ldquo; she mumbled in my ear, making me glare at her playfully. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Okay, girls, our taxi should be waiting for us, so we should really get going,&rdquo; Isaac said apologetically. &ldquo;Are you both okay for a ride or&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"We&rsquo;ll be fine,&ldquo; I said, waving my hand. \"You guys go. I&rsquo;ll call you tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"We look forward to it,&ldquo; my mum said, smiling with relief. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We all exchanged hugs once more before bidding Isaac and my mum a goodbye. Brie and I also went our own way, managing to find a taxi to take us back to our flat. I felt so much more happier as we sat in the backseat, on our way home. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m really happy for you, Y/N,&rdquo; Brie said, squeezing my hand. &ldquo;You did good.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled at her with adoration. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Yeah you could&rsquo;ve,&ldquo; she said with certainty. \"You&rsquo;re strong. That&rsquo;s why I love you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little surprised to hear her say that, and she must have realised what she said because her smile faded and any confidence she once had was now gone and replaced by nervousness. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I- erm-&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re honest,&rdquo; I cut her off, not breaking eye contact. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why <i>I </i>love <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her eyebrows with surprise, but eventually a toothy smile broke out on her face. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I love you.&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I grinned. \"I love you, too, Brie.&rdquo;</p>",
