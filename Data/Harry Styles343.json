Eddie was currently playing the guitar on the floor of his room at the beach house as you lied on his fluffy white comforter. Eddie\u2019s mum had invited you over for the family holidays again but this time your family had decided to actually rent the cabin next door, so the four of you tagged along with The Styles for the holidays.\u00a0</p><p>You had thought this would be the perfect time to tell Eddie for he would be close to the sea and he always said how much he loved the sea, how good the waves could do to a man so you thought he wouldn\u2019t be half as mad as he would had he been back home. He had decided he wanted to play the guitar just after seeing your brother playing on the porch late at night when your parents had already gone to their room. Their relationship was as messy as it could get, once they were apart and the next day they were back together but you had learnt to ignore that, to ignore them for the most part, and so in those summer nights you would stay with your brother on the porch reading a book as the ocean breeze hit the back of your neck and he played the guitar. And now Eddie wanted to learn, for some reason- maybe to enjoy more of your\u00a0\u201c<i>hot brother\u2019s\u201d </i>company or maybe because all of a sudden he was suddenly interested in music. Yeah, probably the first one.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was almost good.\u201d You told him as he smiled playfully at you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you keep that up I won\u2019t take you to any awards show.\u201d He shurgged and you laughed.\u00a0<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI better change then. Chances are high you make it.\u201d You joked as he chuckled and rested his back on the wall, looking at you with the meaningul look only he could give you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here too.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He smiled before he resumed playing the guitar, thinking how happy he <i>really was</i> that you were there even though he had feared you coming on holidays with them. With each passing day, he was more and more certain of his brother\u2019s feelings for you and it made him worried sick- to think that he could ever be anything but friendly with you. It wasn\u2019t as if he was in love with you, not at all, that thought alone was almost repulsive- but you were the closest thing to a sister he had and only to think his brother could hurt you in any way? You flipped the page of your book and bumped with Harry\u2019s eyes when you looked ahead through the window to the beach, he was coming up to the house from the seashore and his green eyes were set on you, a big happy grin on his face.</p><p>He glanced over at his brother and rolled his eyes, pointing at his wrist as if he had an invisible watch and frowning;\u00a0<i>it was his turn to have you,\u00a0</i>which made you roll your eyes and smile. But he was right, you hadn\u2019t been alone with him all day and if you were being fair, you missed him as well so you showed him your tongue playfully and he brought his hand to his chest as if you had hit him, shaking his head with a smile before disappearing inside the house. All this time, Eddie had been frantically typing away on his phone so he stopped you right when you were going to bring it up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEddie, there\u2019s something I need to-\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJack just asked me out.\u201d He raised his eyebrows.\u00a0</p><p>He had met Jack just the day before, down at the beach, and they had instantly hit it off so you smiled at his good news, not having the energy to being annoyed about him not listening.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Ed.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat you have to tell me.\u201d He stared at you.\u00a0\u201cCan it wait?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You nodded, standing from his bed and walking outside his room as he started getting ready for his date. You rested your head against his door as soon as you closed it and sighed. <i>Did he already know? You hadn\u2019t said you needed to tell him something, only that you needed to-\u00a0</i></p><p>Walking inside the kitchen, you smiled at the sight of your secret boyfriend cutting watermelon and putting the pieces on a bowl. He was shirtless, light blue swimming trunks on his hips. He had spent the morning on the beach with his mum. You smiled as you rested your hip on the counter next to his fruit bowl and took a piece of watermelon, bringing it to your mouth and smirking as he watched you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, hi stranger.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, looking around before pressing his hips against yours, trapping you against the counter with both hands on your sides as he leaned in to capture your lips with his. He hummed at the taste of cold watermelon water dripping from your lips and he pushed you once against the counter, thrusting his hips in a warning way when you teased him with your tongue.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you don\u2019t have plans tonight.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You smiled, you had spent most of your time with Eddie or with your brother so it was true you had been depriving him of his<i> precious time alone with you</i> so you pecked his nose as you shook your head, making him grin as he squeezed your hip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood then now you do.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0\u201cI want to spend some alone time with my girl.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI want to spend some time alone with you too.\u201d You whispered as he smiled and raised you up so you were sitting on the counter, his hands running up and down your naked thighs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t stop thinking about last night all day.\u201d He whispered,</p><p>for the night before you had stumbled over to his room, very late and kinda drunk, and you had asked him to shower with you, which had resulted in hot, hard thrusts on the shower that had left you walking funny for the whole morning after.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI could still feel you just hours ago.\u201d You whispered, knowing the effect it would have on him and he groaned, thrusting his hips against yours again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNot anymore?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You stared into his eyes, shooking your head slowly as you played with the hem of this trunks. Maybe it was the adrenaline rush at the fear of getting caught, or maybe it was the safety of hearing Eddie\u2019s shower running as he sang but you were loving the way he was breathing, looking down at your small hands as your fingertips ran his skin under the hem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWill you fix that, babe?\u201d You asked him, getting your fingertips dangerously closed to his groin.\u00a0\u201cWill you make me feel you like that again?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. You\u2019re gonna drive me crazy.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d You smirked, your nails caressing the skin around his lenght.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI want to fuck you against this counter.\u201d He whispered, making your breath hitched on your throat as he regained control of the situation.\u00a0\u201cI want to push you against the tile and fuck you so hard you\u2019ll feel me for a week. You would like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a tease, baby girl, but two can play this game.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He laughed at your flustered expression, lips parted, flushed cheeks and eyes wide, and he took your hand out of his trucks, pecking your lips sweetly a few times before he took the watermelon bowl and walked to the couch, putting on some TV right before his mum walked inside the house too, holding her white beach hat over her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Y/N, love.\u201d She smiled.\u00a0\u201cHarry Edward Styles, did you just prepare some watermelon for yourself and not for Y/N? Where are your manners, boy?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough for her here, mum.\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re sharing. She\u2019s tiny, can\u2019t you see her? She\u2019d probably have enough with just one piece.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Anne frowned.\u00a0\u201cExcuse the oldest, sometimes he seems the baby.\u201d He told you as you chuckled, hopping from the counter and walking towards the couch next to Harry.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMatty is the oldest.\u201d He said.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNot in this room.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the oldest.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my room.\u201d She declared, staring into his eyes as if that had been enough as he laughed.\u00a0\u201cGo get some of that fruit, Y/N. Where\u2019s Eddie?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>She stopped and stared at the two of you with a suspicious look as he caught you dodging Harry\u2019s hand as you approached him on the couch. She smiled as he watched her own son, eyes sparkling and dimples out, and in that moment she loved you for that for she hadn\u2019t seen her son like that in a lot of time it seemed. You were laughing <i>stop Harry </i>before you replied to her question.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the shower.\u201d You smiled, shifting awkwardly as you tried to avoid Harry\u2019s feet.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s going out tonight.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh did that Jack guy ask him out?\u201d She asked and you nodded, chuckling.\u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna go check on him.\u201d She grinned, walking inside his room as you heard her playfully signing, teasing her youngest son about his date.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N you\u2019re a loudmouth!\u201d You laughed as you heard him yelling from his room.\u00a0\u201cMum ,stop! I\u2019m naked under this towel, woman!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>That was the last thing you heard before she closed the door. Had you been in Anne\u2019s mind, you would have known she was sitting on her son\u2019s bed, not only because she felt guilty about having left her sons behind in the city when she moved here with Robin, but also because she was afraid a problem was going to burst soon. If only she could talk to him, if she could make him understand that Y/N wasn\u2019t going to substitute him, that he was still a very, very important part of her life, just maybe not the <i>only </i>important guy anymore. She smiled at Eddie as he frowned at her, telling her she was <i>acting weird </i>as he got changed. <i>Just remember how much that girl loves you.\u00a0</i></p><p>You were sitting on the couch next to Harry, your feet tucked under his thigh as your back rested on the other end of the sofa. Every time he would glance at you, you fought the urge of getting closer, for Eddie was to come out any minute now, and as much as you wanted to kiss him you couldn\u2019t risk it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so far away.\u201d He whispered, pouting dramatically and you rested your feet on his lap, making him roll his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI want to hold you, not your stinky feet.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey! They\u2019re not stinky!\u201d</p><p>You heard the snap of the camere of his phone as he cursed and chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you just take a picture of my feet? What is wrong with you?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, silly doll. I took a picture of your face. See?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He turned the phone to you and you frowned again as you saw the picture. You were frowing because he had said your feet were stinky and you didn\u2019t look pretty at all so you started blushing and tried to take the phone from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh come on! Delete that immediately\u201d You said as he hovered over you, his phone on your back as he peppered small pecks along your skin.\u00a0\u201cThis is not gonna work!\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re deleting that photo!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He pulled away from you and rested his back on the couch as he pretended to bring his attention back to the movie and a second later you heard Eddie talking to his mum as he walked to the kitchen, grabbing a glass of water and rolling his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, mum, I know STDs are a thing. Geez.\u201d He rolled his eyes as both Harry and you chuckled.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like it is my first date ever, mum. Relax.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, baby, I just worry. I\u2019m your mum.\u201d She smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHoney leave the boy alone.\u201d Robin walked towards the porch with a cup of tea and a book.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you, Robin. Thank God you\u2019re here.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSure, son. Have a ball.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Your brother wasn\u2019t having dinner at the cabin either, so you decided to listen to Harry\u2019s begs and left your parents have the closest thing to a date they\u2019d have these days as you had dinner with the Styles. Anne had made a big salad and she was sitting across from you when Harry placed his hand on your thigh under the table. He smiled at you when you gave him a warning look.\u00a0</p><p>He was too close, the whole time he was too close, when you were helping Anne with the dishes and he would press his chest to your back playfully or when he would caress the skin on the back of your hand. You mentioned it once he closed the door of his room after himself and he just shrugged and walked towards you, pressing his lips against yours as he pulled you down on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d He said, a little out of the blue and you smiled on the kiss.</p><p>You tangled your fingers on his hair, pulling his mouth to you and diving your tongue inside his mouth, enjoying the now familiar taste, the always thrilling wetness, the warmth. He moaned against your mouth as he let you kissed him, kissing you back in a way that was letting you know he wanted it slow this time. So he gripped your hips to stop the movement when you started grining against his arousal.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRide me, Y/N.\u201d He whispered against your mouth.\u00a0\u201cPlease.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>With that you rolled over, pushing him under you as you straddle him whilst he grinned widely, both hands on your hips. He was excited.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are so perfect.\u201d You whispered, looking at every inch of skin of his face as he just smiled at you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You were getting wetter just thinking about sinking down on him as his lenght stretched you beyond belief. You couldn\u2019t wait to have him again and then the memory of the night before on his shower wouldn\u2019t leave your mind. He had never fucked you harder, the way he was thrusting inside you, reaching your belly as you moaned his name had you wet enough to drip on the lower part of his belly so you grind your hips a couple times against his hard on over his pyjama pants, watching a thin shiny coat covered the cotton.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N I might come just looking at you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s strangled beg made you smile and then you undressed him as he ripped your panties- you had spent more money on panties on the last few months than on your entire life- and then you started teasing him, moving on top of him without getting him inside, sinking down just a little, so the tip would feel your wet walls and then moving up again, until he was about to cry so you soothed him by sinking down very slowly, moaning as his eyes rolled to the back of his head.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFuck baby, you feel so good.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You only moaned as a replied, running your nails down his chest as he hissed, bringing you down so he could kiss you. You gave in for a while, your lips parted over his as he breathed you in, but then your blood started boiling on your veins and no oxygen was enough so you lifted your chin so you could get air in as your belly started to burn as well. He didn\u2019t mind that time because as much as he liked kissing you, he knew you were about to come, and he couldn\u2019t think of a more pleasant sight. So he frowned as he tried to hold it in, <i>let her come first, let her come first </i>and he brought his fingers to your clit, stimullating that over sensitive part of you which made you lose the last bit of rational thought you had held on to and you rid him as you came, your sex becoming autonomous as it clenched around him, as if milking every single drop of him.\u00a0</p><p>You fell asleep after round three, for you had stayed up talking and kissing until you ended up making love again. Twice. And so you were fast asleep, resting your head on his chest as he held you to him when Eddie burst inside the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry, Harry I need your help.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He had been in a rush, he was worried about Jack\u2019s nose- <i>was it broken? </i>So he didn\u2019t knock or worry about his brother having some girl over, he wouldn\u2019t have them actually sleeping on his bed but everything stopped and everything started to stop making sense once he saw his shirless best friend lying on his brother\u2019s chest. His eyes opened widely and he felt the tears threatening to come out- <i>why hadn\u2019t she told him? Did she not want him to know? What sort of idiot did she think he was?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Eddie?\u201d He asked, pulling you back down on the bed before he talked to you.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, go back to sleep.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Eddie felt his heart break at the way his brother was acting around you, as if he truly&hellip; As if you were really his <i>baby </i>not his best friend anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s.. It\u2019s Jack. We got into a fight. Well, he got into a fight and his nose is bleeding like crazy and he doesn\u2019t want me to get him to the hospital\u201d All the time he was staring right into your eyes \u201che says he\u2019s on probation or some shit and I don\u2019t know what to do, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s broken.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah, okay. I\u2019ll be out in a second.\u201d Harry got up from the bed, thank God he was wearing underpants, and he got dressed in cotton shorts and a t-shirt.\u00a0\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOutside.\u201d Eddie said but still he didn\u2019t move as his brother rushed next to him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He stood there, staring into your eyes and looking down at his brother\u2019s shirt on you and you bit on your bottom lip, tears running down your cheeks as you felt all the guilt hitting you like a bag of bricks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d You asked him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, still in shock.\u00a0\u201cI drove us here. He just&hellip; We got thrown away from a club for kissing and he just fought the bouncer, called him a homophobic shit and then&hellip; Yeah, it was bad.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ed?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Eddie turned his head when he heard Jack calling his name and you jumped out of the bed, poured some water on your face and got to the living room, decided to help them with the wound. You had done that many times before, since your brother was the king of getting into fights back in his teenage years so you knew what to do.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was urging him to clean his face on the sink, blood and water running down the white tiles, as he held gauzes on his hand. You took them from him as he looked down at you asking you whether you were okay and to go back to bed but you shook your head, you wanted to help, so he let you take the kit and sat Jack on the toilet seat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you open your mouth for me?\u201d You asked him and he nodded, opening his mouth as you checked the back of his throat.\u00a0\u201cEddie can you give me the lighter on your phone?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You checked there was no blood on the back of his throat and then you urged him to blow his nose despite the pain. You touched his nose, hard and still, and he yelped and flinched so you smiled slightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not broken.\u201d You told Eddie.\u00a0\u201cBut&hellip; If you don\u2019t get better in a few days then you do need to go to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it. If I go to the doctor then it\u2019s over for me. I&hellip; I did something and it was about a fight again so if I go to the doctor because of another fight? That\u2019d be a relapse and I might even go to fucking jail.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You glanced at Harry as he placed his body in between Jack and you and you didn\u2019t fail to notice the way his shoulders were visibly tense, his jaw clenched as he put a hand down your leg, pulling you behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t say anything.\u201d You said as you got out ofHarry\u2019s protective shield.\u201dBut if you don\u2019t get better then&hellip; Then we\u2019ll see.\u201d You nodded before you got all the things you needed to clean Jack\u2019s wound and started working on it.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you two go get him some food and water and a couple advils? And maybe some ice too?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Eddie nodded and walked out of the bathroom, placing his hand on your back so he could pass, and Harry followed him behind, whispering to call if you felt even a slightly bit not safe which made you roll your eyes. You flinched at his contact though and he frowned and walked towards the kitchen. Eddie was making tea as he got peas out of the freezer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been fucking her?\u201d Eddie asked in a whisper.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Ed.\u201d Harry shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI love her.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo what does it change?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cYou said you loved Maggie as well and then you went to the States and forgot all about her. Have you told her?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not&hellip; It\u2019s not the same, Ed. I was sixteen when that happened I didn\u2019t even know what love was. And no, I haven\u2019t told her\u00a0\u2018cause there\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, so the fact that you\u2019re fucking leaving again doesn\u2019t seem like something she needs to know?\u201d Eddie yelled.\u00a0\u201cListen I can\u2019t stop you from being an ass but I won\u2019t let you break Y/N\u2019s heart like it didn\u2019t matter! Because it does matter! She\u2019s&hellip; You don\u2019t deserve her.\u201d Eddie placed the kettle on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying, Ed.\u201d Harry said.\u00a0\u201cI got a job as a teacher in Uni. I\u2019m going to reject it.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie frowned.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking staying because I don\u2019t want to lose her, okay? Listen things have been difficult enough. She\u2019s already left me once because of you so&hellip; For once you could I don\u2019t know not think of yourself first and fucking listen to her, make things easier. I love her, Eddie, and I know I have no right to love her but it feels right when I\u2019m with her so please just try to understand it.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTry to understand it? You\u2019re telling me out of all the girls in the world you have to fuck my best friend and I have to understand it? That I have to understand that you\u2019ve been lying to me for God knows how long? You don\u2019t get to ask me to understand, Harry.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Jack walked inside the kitchen before you did and he gave you a smile when you took the seat next to him. You had been talking on the bathroom, kind of ended up coming up with a deal. He would help you with Eddie as a thank you for taking care of him. Sure he was on probation, but the other fight he had had had been a messed up way of trying to protect his little brother. He was getting bullied and the kids took it too far so he had <i>an encounter with the piece of shit </i>that was being mean. The last thing you\u2019d do would be justified violence, but you remembered when you were in high school and it was your own who was being bullied&hellip; You got it. Had you been a little stronger, you\u2019d have done the same.\u00a0</p><p>After having food enough to take the pills and lots of water by your demands, Jack made his way inside Eddie\u2019s bed and you asked Harry to give you some time with Eddie which he reluctantly do. You were doing the dishes when Eddie walked inside the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, thank you for&hellip; Taking care of Jack.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me for that.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cAbout what you saw before, I-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d Eddie said, clearing the table.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you at all.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gave you a stern look before he kept some things on the fridge and then he made his way inside his room, not adding anything else. You stood there like an idiot before you made your way to your own cabin through the beach, getting inside your bed with your feet covered in sand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The next morning you got downstairs pretty late, when your brother was having his second breakfast of the day after working out. You took some of the stawberry milkshake he had made.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry called me last night.\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cOr morning.. I don\u2019t know what time it was. He asked me to check if you were on your room. What the hell\u2019s been going on?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cEddie\u2019s just not talking to me.\u201d You sighed.\u00a0\u201cBut&hellip; Nothing\u2019s going on, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTalking about the devil.\u201d He raised his eyebrows as Harry walked your porch towards the cristal door to the living room and kitchen.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll leave you guys alone.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cEddie said you guys talked things out last night.\u201d Harry said, standing in front of you.\u00a0\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk things out.\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cHe just said he didn\u2019t want to talk to me. He didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain myself.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I talked to him before, when you were helping Jack, I\u2019m sure he will-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI just told him I love you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d You cried.\u00a0\u201cHe&hellip; I needed to talk to him first! You said you\u2019d respect that!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, baby, he\u2019s the one who didn\u2019t want to talk to you, not me, don\u2019t yell at me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the reason he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me! You had no right!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI had no right? Y/N you already ended things between us once and I respected that but why do I have to be the one who gives up here? I don\u2019t want to give you up!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou have no right to make me choose!\u201d You frowned.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one making you choose, Y/N, can\u2019t you see that? Eddie is! And still you yell at me? How is that fair? Do you even know how it feels like? To know I\u2019m clearly second here? How would you feel like if I let you know you\u2019re second to Louise? I\u2019m not the one making you choose, Y/N, but it still sucks that you choose him.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say. You didn\u2019t have to give anything up to be with me.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>His whole expression changed. He was about to say it, that he had said no to that job in New York so he could stay with you. But he bit his tongue, he looked down at the floor and counted to ten. <i>Don\u2019t speak when you\u2019re too mad or when you\u2019re too happy, </i>his mother\u2019s words replaying on his mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He nodded as you wiped the tear that had just scaped your eye and then he gently pulled you to his chest, afraid that you might push him away, but you didn\u2019t, you hugged him back and rested your face on his chest, letting him caress the low of your back before you looked up into his eyes and he leaned down to press a chaste kiss against your lips.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until a few days later when Eddie took a seat on the chair next to yours. You were reading your book, enjoying the nice evening breeze when he cleared his throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlaying the guitar without your mean girl comments is not the same.\u201d He let out which made you smile at him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you any better?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been three days.\u201d He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cAnd quite frankly I haven\u2019t been able to play much with Harry mopping around the house as if someone just died. He\u2019s really hurting.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d Your voice croaked.\u00a0\u201cYou said so yourself, he\u2019s not one to fall in love.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I thought but&hellip;\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very sorry.\u201d He looked straight into your eyes.\u00a0\u201cAbout the way I came across about this. I&hellip;\u00a0 I just didn\u2019t expect it. I mean I knew he had a thing for you, I live with him but&hellip; I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d actually lie to me like that.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know. I should have never. I\u2019m terribly sorry, I feel like shit.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo but, I mean I kind of proved you right didn\u2019t I? You didn\u2019t want to tell me because you thought I\u2019d lose my shit and I did so&hellip; I guess you were right.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have lied anyway. I should have told you I had feelings for him.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou love him too, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m with him I feel like everything is okay.\u201d You told your best friend.\u00a0\u201cBut they always say there\u2019s lots of men out there and not so many good friends so&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make you break up with anyone.\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not what friends do. I know I acted like an ass but.. I didn\u2019t want him to hurt you and at the same time I was afraid that you were going to pull far away from me.\u201d He smiled sadly.\u00a0\u201cBut&hellip; I mean sooner or later you\u2019re gonna have a boyfriend, yeah? And at least H knows who calls the shots here.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMe, clearly.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d He grinned, swatting your arm.\u00a0\u201cI just mean&hellip; I\u2019m sorry and&hellip; I won\u2019t be a problem for you two&hellip; You\u2019d have enough to deal with with my brother\u2019s shit without me adding any more drama. How much of a shitty boyfriend is he anyways?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, too much. I thought I could hear you talk about him like that but that\u2019s gross.\u201d He shut his eyes as you chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get better. I hope. I mean it\u2019s enough that he\u2019s not going to New York like if you add the heartbreak to that&hellip; Who would ever stand him?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s not going to New York?\u201d You frowned and Eddie sighed. You didn\u2019t know that. He shouldn\u2019t have said it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe got a job offer in New York in one of dad\u2019s friend\u2019s enterprise. He rejected it because he didn\u2019t want to go anymore.\u201d He shrugged as you smiled, tears brimming on the corners of your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>You knew he didn\u2019t want that job anyway. He didn\u2019t want to work for his dad or for anyone related to him. He wanted to be a lawyer, not a bussiness man, if possible he wanted to be a lawyer for those people in real need, so you were happy he had found the courage to say no and follow his heart.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd now you can go tell him I\u2019m the best best friend and brother ever and that you guys have my blessing.\u201d You got up as he moved aside for you to walk towards his cabin.\u00a0\u201cBut granted, don\u2019t kiss in front of me or anything weird.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You were grinning as you walked towards their house, calling his name from the entrance but no one came to greet you so you frowned as you made your way to his room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey stranger.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He was listening to music, so he got his headphones off and got up from the mattress leaving his phone on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI just talked to Eddie, for real.\u201d You smiled and even though he didn\u2019t know what he had said, your smile was already giving you away.\u00a0\u201cHe said we couldn\u2019t <i>kiss in front of him or do anything weird</i>.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Harry laughed, walking towards you and pulling you in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut I can kiss you in my room.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d You nodded, waiting for his lips to press against yours until he did, with a smile he couldn\u2019t erase for the life of him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI fucking love you.\u201d He said as he lift you up and sat you on the small table near the door.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo but I mean that in like an I\u2019m-gonna-marry-you-someday way\u201d He peppered kisses along your neck as you chuckled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s really excited.\u201d You laughed.\u00a0\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhy do you smell so good?\u201d He sniffled the spot of your neck behind your ear as you laughed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, I have something I think you\u2019ll like.\u201d You smiled mischeviously and he grinned in anticipation.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Without taking your eyes from him, you slowly took off your summer dress, showing him the pink lace set of underwear you had brought for him. His eyes almost fell from his eyeballs as the pink tinged your cheeks too.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br/></p><p>With that he grabbed you and lied you on his bed, hovering over you before he kissed every inch of skin, coming up to your lips to make out for the longest time before he even started touching you. He just wanted to kiss you first really, to feel your full lips and enjoy the taste of you without distractions but then when your sounds became too much, he slipped his fingers inside of you. He wanted to see you first, to have you all undone for him before he could lose his mind over you, so he moved his fingers in and out, repeting in his head <i>that you were his, that you were his, that you were made for him. </i>And you frowned and whined, tangling your fingers on his hair before you smiled, deliciously.\u00a0</p><p>When you were with him you felt like everything was okay.\u00a0</p>",

Chances are high you make it.\u201d You joked as he chuckled and rested his back on the wall, looking at you with the meaningul look only he could give you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here too.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He smiled before he resumed playing the guitar, thinking how happy he <i>really was</i> that you were there even though he had feared you coming on holidays with them. With each passing day, he was more and more certain of his brother\u2019s feelings for you and it made him worried sick- to think that he could ever be anything but friendly with you. It wasn\u2019t as if he was in love with you, not at all, that thought alone was almost repulsive- but you were the closest thing to a sister he had and only to think his brother could hurt you in any way? You flipped the page of your book and bumped with Harry\u2019s eyes when you looked ahead through the window to the beach, he was coming up to the house from the seashore and his green eyes were set on you, a big happy grin on his face.</p><p>He glanced over at his brother and rolled his eyes, pointing at his wrist as if he had an invisible watch and frowning;\u00a0<i>it was his turn to have you,\u00a0</i>which made you roll your eyes and smile. But he was right, you hadn\u2019t been alone with him all day and if you were being fair, you missed him as well so you showed him your tongue playfully and he brought his hand to his chest as if you had hit him, shaking his head with a smile before disappearing inside the house. All this time, Eddie had been frantically typing away on his phone so he stopped you right when you were going to bring it up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEddie, there\u2019s something I need to-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJack just asked me out.\u201d He raised his eyebrows.\u00a0</p><p>He had met Jack just the day before, down at the beach, and they had instantly hit it off so you smiled at his good news, not having the energy to being annoyed about him not listening.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Ed.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat you have to tell me.\u201d He stared at you.\u00a0\u201cCan it wait?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You nodded, standing from his bed and walking outside his room as he started getting ready for his date. You rested your head against his door as soon as you closed it and sighed. <i>Did he already know? You hadn\u2019t said you needed to tell him something, only that you needed to-\u00a0</i></p><p>Walking inside the kitchen, you smiled at the sight of your secret boyfriend cutting watermelon and putting the pieces on a bowl. He was shirtless, light blue swimming trunks on his hips. He had spent the morning on the beach with his mum. You smiled as you rested your hip on the counter next to his fruit bowl and took a piece of watermelon, bringing it to your mouth and smirking as he watched you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, hi stranger.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, looking around before pressing his hips against yours, trapping you against the counter with both hands on your sides as he leaned in to capture your lips with his. He hummed at the taste of cold watermelon water dripping from your lips and he pushed you once against the counter, thrusting his hips in a warning way when you teased him with your tongue.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you don\u2019t have plans tonight.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>You smiled, you had spent most of your time with Eddie or with your brother so it was true you had been depriving him of his<i> precious time alone with you</i> so you pecked his nose as you shook your head, making him grin as he squeezed your hip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood then now you do.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0\u201cI want to spend some alone time with my girl.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI want to spend some time alone with you too.\u201d You whispered as he smiled and raised you up so you were sitting on the counter, his hands running up and down your naked thighs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t stop thinking about last night all day.\u201d He whispered,</p><p>for the night before you had stumbled over to his room, very late and kinda drunk, and you had asked him to shower with you, which had resulted in hot, hard thrusts on the shower that had left you walking funny for the whole morning after.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI could still feel you just hours ago.\u201d You whispered, knowing the effect it would have on him and he groaned, thrusting his hips against yours again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNot anymore?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You stared into his eyes, shooking your head slowly as you played with the hem of this trunks. Maybe it was the adrenaline rush at the fear of getting caught, or maybe it was the safety of hearing Eddie\u2019s shower running as he sang but you were loving the way he was breathing, looking down at your small hands as your fingertips ran his skin under the hem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWill you fix that, babe?\u201d You asked him, getting your fingertips dangerously closed to his groin.\u00a0\u201cWill you make me feel you like that again?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. You\u2019re gonna drive me crazy.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d You smirked, your nails caressing the skin around his lenght.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI want to fuck you against this counter.\u201d He whispered, making your breath hitched on your throat as he regained control of the situation.\u00a0\u201cI want to push you against the tile and fuck you so hard you\u2019ll feel me for a week. You would like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a tease, baby girl, but two can play this game.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He laughed at your flustered expression, lips parted, flushed cheeks and eyes wide, and he took your hand out of his trucks, pecking your lips sweetly a few times before he took the watermelon bowl and walked to the couch, putting on some TV right before his mum walked inside the house too, holding her white beach hat over her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Y/N, love.\u201d She smiled.\u00a0\u201cHarry Edward Styles, did you just prepare some watermelon for yourself and not for Y/N? Where are your manners, boy?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough for her here, mum.\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re sharing. She\u2019s tiny, can\u2019t you see her? She\u2019d probably have enough with just one piece.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Anne frowned.\u00a0\u201cExcuse the oldest, sometimes he seems the baby.\u201d He told you as you chuckled, hopping from the counter and walking towards the couch next to Harry.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMatty is the oldest.\u201d He said.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNot in this room.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the oldest.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my room.\u201d She declared, staring into his eyes as if that had been enough as he laughed.\u00a0\u201cGo get some of that fruit, Y/N. Where\u2019s Eddie?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She stopped and stared at the two of you with a suspicious look as he caught you dodging Harry\u2019s hand as you approached him on the couch. She smiled as he watched her own son, eyes sparkling and dimples out, and in that moment she loved you for that for she hadn\u2019t seen her son like that in a lot of time it seemed. You were laughing <i>stop Harry </i>before you replied to her question.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the shower.\u201d You smiled, shifting awkwardly as you tried to avoid Harry\u2019s feet.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s going out tonight.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh did that Jack guy ask him out?\u201d She asked and you nodded, chuckling.\u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna go check on him.\u201d She grinned, walking inside his room as you heard her playfully signing, teasing her youngest son about his date.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N you\u2019re a loudmouth!\u201d You laughed as you heard him yelling from his room.\u00a0\u201cMum ,stop! I\u2019m naked under this towel, woman!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>That was the last thing you heard before she closed the door. Had you been in Anne\u2019s mind, you would have known she was sitting on her son\u2019s bed, not only because she felt guilty about having left her sons behind in the city when she moved here with Robin, but also because she was afraid a problem was going to burst soon. If only she could talk to him, if she could make him understand that Y/N wasn\u2019t going to substitute him, that he was still a very, very important part of her life, just maybe not the <i>only </i>important guy anymore. She smiled at Eddie as he frowned at her, telling her she was <i>acting weird </i>as he got changed. <i>Just remember how much that girl loves you.\u00a0</i></p><p>You were sitting on the couch next to Harry, your feet tucked under his thigh as your back rested on the other end of the sofa. Every time he would glance at you, you fought the urge of getting closer, for Eddie was to come out any minute now, and as much as you wanted to kiss him you couldn\u2019t risk it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so far away.\u201d He whispered, pouting dramatically and you rested your feet on his lap, making him roll his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI want to hold you, not your stinky feet.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey! They\u2019re not stinky!\u201d</p><p>You heard the snap of the camere of his phone as he cursed and chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you just take a picture of my feet? What is wrong with you?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, silly doll. I took a picture of your face. See?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He turned the phone to you and you frowned again as you saw the picture. You were frowing because he had said your feet were stinky and you didn\u2019t look pretty at all so you started blushing and tried to take the phone from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh come on! Delete that immediately\u201d You said as he hovered over you, his phone on your back as he peppered small pecks along your skin.\u00a0\u201cThis is not gonna work!\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re deleting that photo!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He pulled away from you and rested his back on the couch as he pretended to bring his attention back to the movie and a second later you heard Eddie talking to his mum as he walked to the kitchen, grabbing a glass of water and rolling his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, mum, I know STDs are a thing. Geez.\u201d He rolled his eyes as both Harry and you chuckled.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like it is my first date ever, mum. Relax.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know, baby, I just worry. I\u2019m your mum.\u201d She smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHoney leave the boy alone.\u201d Robin walked towards the porch with a cup of tea and a book.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThank you, Robin. Thank God you\u2019re here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSure, son. Have a ball.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Your brother wasn\u2019t having dinner at the cabin either, so you decided to listen to Harry\u2019s begs and left your parents have the closest thing to a date they\u2019d have these days as you had dinner with the Styles. Anne had made a big salad and she was sitting across from you when Harry placed his hand on your thigh under the table. He smiled at you when you gave him a warning look.\u00a0</p><p>He was too close, the whole time he was too close, when you were helping Anne with the dishes and he would press his chest to your back playfully or when he would caress the skin on the back of your hand. You mentioned it once he closed the door of his room after himself and he just shrugged and walked towards you, pressing his lips against yours as he pulled you down on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d He said, a little out of the blue and you smiled on the kiss.</p><p>You tangled your fingers on his hair, pulling his mouth to you and diving your tongue inside his mouth, enjoying the now familiar taste, the always thrilling wetness, the warmth. He moaned against your mouth as he let you kissed him, kissing you back in a way that was letting you know he wanted it slow this time. So he gripped your hips to stop the movement when you started grining against his arousal.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRide me, Y/N.\u201d He whispered against your mouth.\u00a0\u201cPlease.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>With that you rolled over, pushing him under you as you straddle him whilst he grinned widely, both hands on your hips. He was excited.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are so perfect.\u201d You whispered, looking at every inch of skin of his face as he just smiled at you.\u00a0<br></p><p>You were getting wetter just thinking about sinking down on him as his lenght stretched you beyond belief. You couldn\u2019t wait to have him again and then the memory of the night before on his shower wouldn\u2019t leave your mind. He had never fucked you harder, the way he was thrusting inside you, reaching your belly as you moaned his name had you wet enough to drip on the lower part of his belly so you grind your hips a couple times against his hard on over his pyjama pants, watching a thin shiny coat covered the cotton.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N I might come just looking at you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s strangled beg made you smile and then you undressed him as he ripped your panties- you had spent more money on panties on the last few months than on your entire life- and then you started teasing him, moving on top of him without getting him inside, sinking down just a little, so the tip would feel your wet walls and then moving up again, until he was about to cry so you soothed him by sinking down very slowly, moaning as his eyes rolled to the back of his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFuck baby, you feel so good.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You only moaned as a replied, running your nails down his chest as he hissed, bringing you down so he could kiss you. You gave in for a while, your lips parted over his as he breathed you in, but then your blood started boiling on your veins and no oxygen was enough so you lifted your chin so you could get air in as your belly started to burn as well. He didn\u2019t mind that time because as much as he liked kissing you, he knew you were about to come, and he couldn\u2019t think of a more pleasant sight. So he frowned as he tried to hold it in, <i>let her come first, let her come first </i>and he brought his fingers to your clit, stimullating that over sensitive part of you which made you lose the last bit of rational thought you had held on to and you rid him as you came, your sex becoming autonomous as it clenched around him, as if milking every single drop of him.\u00a0</p><p>You fell asleep after round three, for you had stayed up talking and kissing until you ended up making love again. Twice. And so you were fast asleep, resting your head on his chest as he held you to him when Eddie burst inside the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry, Harry I need your help.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He had been in a rush, he was worried about Jack\u2019s nose- <i>was it broken? </i>So he didn\u2019t knock or worry about his brother having some girl over, he wouldn\u2019t have them actually sleeping on his bed but everything stopped and everything started to stop making sense once he saw his shirless best friend lying on his brother\u2019s chest. His eyes opened widely and he felt the tears threatening to come out- <i>why hadn\u2019t she told him? Did she not want him to know? What sort of idiot did she think he was?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Eddie?\u201d He asked, pulling you back down on the bed before he talked to you.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, go back to sleep.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Eddie felt his heart break at the way his brother was acting around you, as if he truly\u2026 As if you were really his <i>baby </i>not his best friend anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s.. It\u2019s Jack. We got into a fight. Well, he got into a fight and his nose is bleeding like crazy and he doesn\u2019t want me to get him to the hospital\u201d All the time he was staring right into your eyes \u201che says he\u2019s on probation or some shit and I don\u2019t know what to do, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s broken.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah, okay. I\u2019ll be out in a second.\u201d Harry got up from the bed, thank God he was wearing underpants, and he got dressed in cotton shorts and a t-shirt.\u00a0\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOutside.\u201d Eddie said but still he didn\u2019t move as his brother rushed next to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>He stood there, staring into your eyes and looking down at his brother\u2019s shirt on you and you bit on your bottom lip, tears running down your cheeks as you felt all the guilt hitting you like a bag of bricks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d You asked him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, still in shock.\u00a0\u201cI drove us here. He just\u2026 We got thrown away from a club for kissing and he just fought the bouncer, called him a homophobic shit and then\u2026 Yeah, it was bad.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ed?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Eddie turned his head when he heard Jack calling his name and you jumped out of the bed, poured some water on your face and got to the living room, decided to help them with the wound. You had done that many times before, since your brother was the king of getting into fights back in his teenage years so you knew what to do.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was urging him to clean his face on the sink, blood and water running down the white tiles, as he held gauzes on his hand. You took them from him as he looked down at you asking you whether you were okay and to go back to bed but you shook your head, you wanted to help, so he let you take the kit and sat Jack on the toilet seat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you open your mouth for me?\u201d You asked him and he nodded, opening his mouth as you checked the back of his throat.\u00a0\u201cEddie can you give me the lighter on your phone?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You checked there was no blood on the back of his throat and then you urged him to blow his nose despite the pain. You touched his nose, hard and still, and he yelped and flinched so you smiled slightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not broken.\u201d You told Eddie.\u00a0\u201cBut\u2026 If you don\u2019t get better in a few days then you do need to go to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it. If I go to the doctor then it\u2019s over for me. I\u2026 I did something and it was about a fight again so if I go to the doctor because of another fight? That\u2019d be a relapse and I might even go to fucking jail.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You glanced at Harry as he placed his body in between Jack and you and you didn\u2019t fail to notice the way his shoulders were visibly tense, his jaw clenched as he put a hand down your leg, pulling you behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t say anything.\u201d You said as you got out ofHarry\u2019s protective shield.\u201dBut if you don\u2019t get better then\u2026 Then we\u2019ll see.\u201d You nodded before you got all the things you needed to clean Jack\u2019s wound and started working on it.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you two go get him some food and water and a couple advils? And maybe some ice too?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Eddie nodded and walked out of the bathroom, placing his hand on your back so he could pass, and Harry followed him behind, whispering to call if you felt even a slightly bit not safe which made you roll your eyes. You flinched at his contact though and he frowned and walked towards the kitchen. Eddie was making tea as he got peas out of the freezer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been fucking her?\u201d Eddie asked in a whisper.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Ed.\u201d Harry shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI love her.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo what does it change?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cYou said you loved Maggie as well and then you went to the States and forgot all about her. Have you told her?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 It\u2019s not the same, Ed. I was sixteen when that happened I didn\u2019t even know what love was. And no, I haven\u2019t told her\u00a0\u2018cause there\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, so the fact that you\u2019re fucking leaving again doesn\u2019t seem like something she needs to know?\u201d Eddie yelled.\u00a0\u201cListen I can\u2019t stop you from being an ass but I won\u2019t let you break Y/N\u2019s heart like it didn\u2019t matter! Because it does matter! She\u2019s\u2026 You don\u2019t deserve her.\u201d Eddie placed the kettle on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying, Ed.\u201d Harry said.\u00a0\u201cI got a job as a teacher in Uni. I\u2019m going to reject it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie frowned.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking staying because I don\u2019t want to lose her, okay? Listen things have been difficult enough. She\u2019s already left me once because of you so\u2026 For once you could I don\u2019t know not think of yourself first and fucking listen to her, make things easier. I love her, Eddie, and I know I have no right to love her but it feels right when I\u2019m with her so please just try to understand it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTry to understand it? You\u2019re telling me out of all the girls in the world you have to fuck my best friend and I have to understand it? That I have to understand that you\u2019ve been lying to me for God knows how long? You don\u2019t get to ask me to understand, Harry.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Jack walked inside the kitchen before you did and he gave you a smile when you took the seat next to him. You had been talking on the bathroom, kind of ended up coming up with a deal. He would help you with Eddie as a thank you for taking care of him. Sure he was on probation, but the other fight he had had had been a messed up way of trying to protect his little brother. He was getting bullied and the kids took it too far so he had <i>an encounter with the piece of shit </i>that was being mean. The last thing you\u2019d do would be justified violence, but you remembered when you were in high school and it was your own who was being bullied\u2026 You got it. Had you been a little stronger, you\u2019d have done the same.\u00a0</p><p>After having food enough to take the pills and lots of water by your demands, Jack made his way inside Eddie\u2019s bed and you asked Harry to give you some time with Eddie which he reluctantly do. You were doing the dishes when Eddie walked inside the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, thank you for\u2026 Taking care of Jack.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me for that.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cAbout what you saw before, I-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d Eddie said, clearing the table.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you at all.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gave you a stern look before he kept some things on the fridge and then he made his way inside his room, not adding anything else. You stood there like an idiot before you made your way to your own cabin through the beach, getting inside your bed with your feet covered in sand.\u00a0<br></p><p>The next morning you got downstairs pretty late, when your brother was having his second breakfast of the day after working out. You took some of the stawberry milkshake he had made.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry called me last night.\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cOr morning.. I don\u2019t know what time it was. He asked me to check if you were on your room. What the hell\u2019s been going on?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cEddie\u2019s just not talking to me.\u201d You sighed.\u00a0\u201cBut\u2026 Nothing\u2019s going on, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTalking about the devil.\u201d He raised his eyebrows as Harry walked your porch towards the cristal door to the living room and kitchen.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll leave you guys alone.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEddie said you guys talked things out last night.\u201d Harry said, standing in front of you.\u00a0\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk things out.\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cHe just said he didn\u2019t want to talk to me. He didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain myself.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell I talked to him before, when you were helping Jack, I\u2019m sure he will-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI just told him I love you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d You cried.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2026 I needed to talk to him first! You said you\u2019d respect that!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, baby, he\u2019s the one who didn\u2019t want to talk to you, not me, don\u2019t yell at me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the reason he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me! You had no right!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI had no right? Y/N you already ended things between us once and I respected that but why do I have to be the one who gives up here? I don\u2019t want to give you up!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou have no right to make me choose!\u201d You frowned.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one making you choose, Y/N, can\u2019t you see that? Eddie is! And still you yell at me? How is that fair? Do you even know how it feels like? To know I\u2019m clearly second here? How would you feel like if I let you know you\u2019re second to Louise? I\u2019m not the one making you choose, Y/N, but it still sucks that you choose him.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say. You didn\u2019t have to give anything up to be with me.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>His whole expression changed. He was about to say it, that he had said no to that job in New York so he could stay with you. But he bit his tongue, he looked down at the floor and counted to ten. <i>Don\u2019t speak when you\u2019re too mad or when you\u2019re too happy, </i>his mother\u2019s words replaying on his mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He nodded as you wiped the tear that had just scaped your eye and then he gently pulled you to his chest, afraid that you might push him away, but you didn\u2019t, you hugged him back and rested your face on his chest, letting him caress the low of your back before you looked up into his eyes and he leaned down to press a chaste kiss against your lips.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until a few days later when Eddie took a seat on the chair next to yours. You were reading your book, enjoying the nice evening breeze when he cleared his throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlaying the guitar without your mean girl comments is not the same.\u201d He let out which made you smile at him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAre you any better?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been three days.\u201d He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cAnd quite frankly I haven\u2019t been able to play much with Harry mopping around the house as if someone just died. He\u2019s really hurting.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d Your voice croaked.\u00a0\u201cYou said so yourself, he\u2019s not one to fall in love.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I thought but\u2026\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very sorry.\u201d He looked straight into your eyes.\u00a0\u201cAbout the way I came across about this. I\u2026\u00a0 I just didn\u2019t expect it. I mean I knew he had a thing for you, I live with him but\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d actually lie to me like that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know. I should have never. I\u2019m terribly sorry, I feel like shit.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo but, I mean I kind of proved you right didn\u2019t I? You didn\u2019t want to tell me because you thought I\u2019d lose my shit and I did so\u2026 I guess you were right.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have lied anyway. I should have told you I had feelings for him.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou love him too, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m with him I feel like everything is okay.\u201d You told your best friend.\u00a0\u201cBut they always say there\u2019s lots of men out there and not so many good friends so\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make you break up with anyone.\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not what friends do. I know I acted like an ass but.. I didn\u2019t want him to hurt you and at the same time I was afraid that you were going to pull far away from me.\u201d He smiled sadly.\u00a0\u201cBut\u2026 I mean sooner or later you\u2019re gonna have a boyfriend, yeah? And at least H knows who calls the shots here.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMe, clearly.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d He grinned, swatting your arm.\u00a0\u201cI just mean\u2026 I\u2019m sorry and\u2026 I won\u2019t be a problem for you two\u2026 You\u2019d have enough to deal with with my brother\u2019s shit without me adding any more drama. How much of a shitty boyfriend is he anyways?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, too much. I thought I could hear you talk about him like that but that\u2019s gross.\u201d He shut his eyes as you chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get better. I hope. I mean it\u2019s enough that he\u2019s not going to New York like if you add the heartbreak to that\u2026 Who would ever stand him?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s not going to New York?\u201d You frowned and Eddie sighed. You didn\u2019t know that. He shouldn\u2019t have said it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe got a job offer in New York in one of dad\u2019s friend\u2019s enterprise. He rejected it because he didn\u2019t want to go anymore.\u201d He shrugged as you smiled, tears brimming on the corners of your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>You knew he didn\u2019t want that job anyway. He didn\u2019t want to work for his dad or for anyone related to him. He wanted to be a lawyer, not a bussiness man, if possible he wanted to be a lawyer for those people in real need, so you were happy he had found the courage to say no and follow his heart.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd now you can go tell him I\u2019m the best best friend and brother ever and that you guys have my blessing.\u201d You got up as he moved aside for you to walk towards his cabin.\u00a0\u201cBut granted, don\u2019t kiss in front of me or anything weird.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You were grinning as you walked towards their house, calling his name from the entrance but no one came to greet you so you frowned as you made your way to his room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey stranger.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>He was listening to music, so he got his headphones off and got up from the mattress leaving his phone on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI just talked to Eddie, for real.\u201d You smiled and even though he didn\u2019t know what he had said, your smile was already giving you away.\u00a0\u201cHe said we couldn\u2019t <i>kiss in front of him or do anything weird</i>.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry laughed, walking towards you and pulling you in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut I can kiss you in my room.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d You nodded, waiting for his lips to press against yours until he did, with a smile he couldn\u2019t erase for the life of him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI fucking love you.\u201d He said as he lift you up and sat you on the small table near the door.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo but I mean that in like an I\u2019m-gonna-marry-you-someday way\u201d He peppered kisses along your neck as you chuckled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s really excited.\u201d You laughed.\u00a0\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhy do you smell so good?\u201d He sniffled the spot of your neck behind your ear as you laughed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, I have something I think you\u2019ll like.\u201d You smiled mischeviously and he grinned in anticipation.\u00a0<br></p><p>Without taking your eyes from him, you slowly took off your summer dress, showing him the pink lace set of underwear you had brought for him. His eyes almost fell from his eyeballs as the pink tinged your cheeks too.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>With that he grabbed you and lied you on his bed, hovering over you before he kissed every inch of skin, coming up to your lips to make out for the longest time before he even started touching you. He just wanted to kiss you first really, to feel your full lips and enjoy the taste of you without distractions but then when your sounds became too much, he slipped his fingers inside of you. He wanted to see you first, to have you all undone for him before he could lose his mind over you, so he moved his fingers in and out, repeting in his head <i>that you were his, that you were his, that you were made for him. </i>And you frowned and whined, tangling your fingers on his hair before you smiled, deliciously.\u00a0</p><p>When you were with him you felt like everything was okay.\u00a0</p></p>",

Eddie was currently playing the guitar on the floor of his room at the beach house as you lied on his fluffy white comforter. Eddie\u2019s mum had invited you over for the family holidays again but this time your family had decided to actually rent the cabin next door, so the four of you tagged along with The Styles for the holidays.\u00a0</p><p>You had thought this would be the perfect time to tell Eddie for he would be close to the sea and he always said how much he loved the sea, how good the waves could do to a man so you thought he wouldn\u2019t be half as mad as he would had he been back home. He had decided he wanted to play the guitar just after seeing your brother playing on the porch late at night when your parents had already gone to their room. Their relationship was as messy as it could get, once they were apart and the next day they were back together but you had learnt to ignore that, to ignore them for the most part, and so in those summer nights you would stay with your brother on the porch reading a book as the ocean breeze hit the back of your neck and he played the guitar. And now Eddie wanted to learn, for some reason- maybe to enjoy more of your\u00a0\u201c<i>hot brother\u2019s\u201d </i>company or maybe because all of a sudden he was suddenly interested in music. Yeah, probably the first one.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was almost good.\u201d You told him as he smiled playfully at you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you keep that up I won\u2019t take you to any awards show.\u201d He shurgged and you laughed.\u00a0<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI better change then. Chances are high you make it.\u201d You joked as he chuckled and rested his back on the wall, looking at you with the meaningul look only he could give you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here too.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He smiled before he resumed playing the guitar, thinking how happy he <i>really was</i> that you were there even though he had feared you coming on holidays with them. With each passing day, he was more and more certain of his brother\u2019s feelings for you and it made him worried sick- to think that he could ever be anything but friendly with you. It wasn\u2019t as if he was in love with you, not at all, that thought alone was almost repulsive- but you were the closest thing to a sister he had and only to think his brother could hurt you in any way? You flipped the page of your book and bumped with Harry\u2019s eyes when you looked ahead through the window to the beach, he was coming up to the house from the seashore and his green eyes were set on you, a big happy grin on his face.</p><p>He glanced over at his brother and rolled his eyes, pointing at his wrist as if he had an invisible watch and frowning;\u00a0<i>it was his turn to have you,\u00a0</i>which made you roll your eyes and smile. But he was right, you hadn\u2019t been alone with him all day and if you were being fair, you missed him as well so you showed him your tongue playfully and he brought his hand to his chest as if you had hit him, shaking his head with a smile before disappearing inside the house. All this time, Eddie had been frantically typing away on his phone so he stopped you right when you were going to bring it up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEddie, there\u2019s something I need to-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJack just asked me out.\u201d He raised his eyebrows.\u00a0</p><p>He had met Jack just the day before, down at the beach, and they had instantly hit it off so you smiled at his good news, not having the energy to being annoyed about him not listening.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Ed.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat you have to tell me.\u201d He stared at you.\u00a0\u201cCan it wait?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You nodded, standing from his bed and walking outside his room as he started getting ready for his date. You rested your head against his door as soon as you closed it and sighed. <i>Did he already know? You hadn\u2019t said you needed to tell him something, only that you needed to-\u00a0</i></p><p>Walking inside the kitchen, you smiled at the sight of your secret boyfriend cutting watermelon and putting the pieces on a bowl. He was shirtless, light blue swimming trunks on his hips. He had spent the morning on the beach with his mum. You smiled as you rested your hip on the counter next to his fruit bowl and took a piece of watermelon, bringing it to your mouth and smirking as he watched you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, hi stranger.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, looking around before pressing his hips against yours, trapping you against the counter with both hands on your sides as he leaned in to capture your lips with his. He hummed at the taste of cold watermelon water dripping from your lips and he pushed you once against the counter, thrusting his hips in a warning way when you teased him with your tongue.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you don\u2019t have plans tonight.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>You smiled, you had spent most of your time with Eddie or with your brother so it was true you had been depriving him of his<i> precious time alone with you</i> so you pecked his nose as you shook your head, making him grin as he squeezed your hip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood then now you do.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0\u201cI want to spend some alone time with my girl.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI want to spend some time alone with you too.\u201d You whispered as he smiled and raised you up so you were sitting on the counter, his hands running up and down your naked thighs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t stop thinking about last night all day.\u201d He whispered,</p><p>for the night before you had stumbled over to his room, very late and kinda drunk, and you had asked him to shower with you, which had resulted in hot, hard thrusts on the shower that had left you walking funny for the whole morning after.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI could still feel you just hours ago.\u201d You whispered, knowing the effect it would have on him and he groaned, thrusting his hips against yours again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNot anymore?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You stared into his eyes, shooking your head slowly as you played with the hem of this trunks. Maybe it was the adrenaline rush at the fear of getting caught, or maybe it was the safety of hearing Eddie\u2019s shower running as he sang but you were loving the way he was breathing, looking down at your small hands as your fingertips ran his skin under the hem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWill you fix that, babe?\u201d You asked him, getting your fingertips dangerously closed to his groin.\u00a0\u201cWill you make me feel you like that again?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. You\u2019re gonna drive me crazy.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d You smirked, your nails caressing the skin around his lenght.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI want to fuck you against this counter.\u201d He whispered, making your breath hitched on your throat as he regained control of the situation.\u00a0\u201cI want to push you against the tile and fuck you so hard you\u2019ll feel me for a week. You would like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a tease, baby girl, but two can play this game.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He laughed at your flustered expression, lips parted, flushed cheeks and eyes wide, and he took your hand out of his trucks, pecking your lips sweetly a few times before he took the watermelon bowl and walked to the couch, putting on some TV right before his mum walked inside the house too, holding her white beach hat over her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Y/N, love.\u201d She smiled.\u00a0\u201cHarry Edward Styles, did you just prepare some watermelon for yourself and not for Y/N? Where are your manners, boy?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough for her here, mum.\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re sharing. She\u2019s tiny, can\u2019t you see her? She\u2019d probably have enough with just one piece.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Anne frowned.\u00a0\u201cExcuse the oldest, sometimes he seems the baby.\u201d He told you as you chuckled, hopping from the counter and walking towards the couch next to Harry.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMatty is the oldest.\u201d He said.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNot in this room.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the oldest.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my room.\u201d She declared, staring into his eyes as if that had been enough as he laughed.\u00a0\u201cGo get some of that fruit, Y/N. Where\u2019s Eddie?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She stopped and stared at the two of you with a suspicious look as he caught you dodging Harry\u2019s hand as you approached him on the couch. She smiled as he watched her own son, eyes sparkling and dimples out, and in that moment she loved you for that for she hadn\u2019t seen her son like that in a lot of time it seemed. You were laughing <i>stop Harry </i>before you replied to her question.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the shower.\u201d You smiled, shifting awkwardly as you tried to avoid Harry\u2019s feet.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s going out tonight.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh did that Jack guy ask him out?\u201d She asked and you nodded, chuckling.\u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna go check on him.\u201d She grinned, walking inside his room as you heard her playfully signing, teasing her youngest son about his date.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N you\u2019re a loudmouth!\u201d You laughed as you heard him yelling from his room.\u00a0\u201cMum ,stop! I\u2019m naked under this towel, woman!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>That was the last thing you heard before she closed the door. Had you been in Anne\u2019s mind, you would have known she was sitting on her son\u2019s bed, not only because she felt guilty about having left her sons behind in the city when she moved here with Robin, but also because she was afraid a problem was going to burst soon. If only she could talk to him, if she could make him understand that Y/N wasn\u2019t going to substitute him, that he was still a very, very important part of her life, just maybe not the <i>only </i>important guy anymore. She smiled at Eddie as he frowned at her, telling her she was <i>acting weird </i>as he got changed. <i>Just remember how much that girl loves you.\u00a0</i></p><p>You were sitting on the couch next to Harry, your feet tucked under his thigh as your back rested on the other end of the sofa. Every time he would glance at you, you fought the urge of getting closer, for Eddie was to come out any minute now, and as much as you wanted to kiss him you couldn\u2019t risk it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so far away.\u201d He whispered, pouting dramatically and you rested your feet on his lap, making him roll his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI want to hold you, not your stinky feet.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey! They\u2019re not stinky!\u201d</p><p>You heard the snap of the camere of his phone as he cursed and chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you just take a picture of my feet? What is wrong with you?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, silly doll. I took a picture of your face. See?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He turned the phone to you and you frowned again as you saw the picture. You were frowing because he had said your feet were stinky and you didn\u2019t look pretty at all so you started blushing and tried to take the phone from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh come on! Delete that immediately\u201d You said as he hovered over you, his phone on your back as he peppered small pecks along your skin.\u00a0\u201cThis is not gonna work!\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re deleting that photo!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He pulled away from you and rested his back on the couch as he pretended to bring his attention back to the movie and a second later you heard Eddie talking to his mum as he walked to the kitchen, grabbing a glass of water and rolling his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, mum, I know STDs are a thing. Geez.\u201d He rolled his eyes as both Harry and you chuckled.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like it is my first date ever, mum. Relax.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know, baby, I just worry. I\u2019m your mum.\u201d She smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHoney leave the boy alone.\u201d Robin walked towards the porch with a cup of tea and a book.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThank you, Robin. Thank God you\u2019re here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSure, son. Have a ball.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Your brother wasn\u2019t having dinner at the cabin either, so you decided to listen to Harry\u2019s begs and left your parents have the closest thing to a date they\u2019d have these days as you had dinner with the Styles. Anne had made a big salad and she was sitting across from you when Harry placed his hand on your thigh under the table. He smiled at you when you gave him a warning look.\u00a0</p><p>He was too close, the whole time he was too close, when you were helping Anne with the dishes and he would press his chest to your back playfully or when he would caress the skin on the back of your hand. You mentioned it once he closed the door of his room after himself and he just shrugged and walked towards you, pressing his lips against yours as he pulled you down on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d He said, a little out of the blue and you smiled on the kiss.</p><p>You tangled your fingers on his hair, pulling his mouth to you and diving your tongue inside his mouth, enjoying the now familiar taste, the always thrilling wetness, the warmth. He moaned against your mouth as he let you kissed him, kissing you back in a way that was letting you know he wanted it slow this time. So he gripped your hips to stop the movement when you started grining against his arousal.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRide me, Y/N.\u201d He whispered against your mouth.\u00a0\u201cPlease.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>With that you rolled over, pushing him under you as you straddle him whilst he grinned widely, both hands on your hips. He was excited.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are so perfect.\u201d You whispered, looking at every inch of skin of his face as he just smiled at you.\u00a0<br></p><p>You were getting wetter just thinking about sinking down on him as his lenght stretched you beyond belief. You couldn\u2019t wait to have him again and then the memory of the night before on his shower wouldn\u2019t leave your mind. He had never fucked you harder, the way he was thrusting inside you, reaching your belly as you moaned his name had you wet enough to drip on the lower part of his belly so you grind your hips a couple times against his hard on over his pyjama pants, watching a thin shiny coat covered the cotton.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N I might come just looking at you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s strangled beg made you smile and then you undressed him as he ripped your panties- you had spent more money on panties on the last few months than on your entire life- and then you started teasing him, moving on top of him without getting him inside, sinking down just a little, so the tip would feel your wet walls and then moving up again, until he was about to cry so you soothed him by sinking down very slowly, moaning as his eyes rolled to the back of his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFuck baby, you feel so good.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You only moaned as a replied, running your nails down his chest as he hissed, bringing you down so he could kiss you. You gave in for a while, your lips parted over his as he breathed you in, but then your blood started boiling on your veins and no oxygen was enough so you lifted your chin so you could get air in as your belly started to burn as well. He didn\u2019t mind that time because as much as he liked kissing you, he knew you were about to come, and he couldn\u2019t think of a more pleasant sight. So he frowned as he tried to hold it in, <i>let her come first, let her come first </i>and he brought his fingers to your clit, stimullating that over sensitive part of you which made you lose the last bit of rational thought you had held on to and you rid him as you came, your sex becoming autonomous as it clenched around him, as if milking every single drop of him.\u00a0</p><p>You fell asleep after round three, for you had stayed up talking and kissing until you ended up making love again. Twice. And so you were fast asleep, resting your head on his chest as he held you to him when Eddie burst inside the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry, Harry I need your help.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He had been in a rush, he was worried about Jack\u2019s nose- <i>was it broken? </i>So he didn\u2019t knock or worry about his brother having some girl over, he wouldn\u2019t have them actually sleeping on his bed but everything stopped and everything started to stop making sense once he saw his shirless best friend lying on his brother\u2019s chest. His eyes opened widely and he felt the tears threatening to come out- <i>why hadn\u2019t she told him? Did she not want him to know? What sort of idiot did she think he was?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Eddie?\u201d He asked, pulling you back down on the bed before he talked to you.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, go back to sleep.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Eddie felt his heart break at the way his brother was acting around you, as if he truly\u2026 As if you were really his <i>baby </i>not his best friend anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s.. It\u2019s Jack. We got into a fight. Well, he got into a fight and his nose is bleeding like crazy and he doesn\u2019t want me to get him to the hospital\u201d All the time he was staring right into your eyes \u201che says he\u2019s on probation or some shit and I don\u2019t know what to do, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s broken.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah, okay. I\u2019ll be out in a second.\u201d Harry got up from the bed, thank God he was wearing underpants, and he got dressed in cotton shorts and a t-shirt.\u00a0\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOutside.\u201d Eddie said but still he didn\u2019t move as his brother rushed next to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>He stood there, staring into your eyes and looking down at his brother\u2019s shirt on you and you bit on your bottom lip, tears running down your cheeks as you felt all the guilt hitting you like a bag of bricks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d You asked him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, still in shock.\u00a0\u201cI drove us here. He just\u2026 We got thrown away from a club for kissing and he just fought the bouncer, called him a homophobic shit and then\u2026 Yeah, it was bad.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ed?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Eddie turned his head when he heard Jack calling his name and you jumped out of the bed, poured some water on your face and got to the living room, decided to help them with the wound. You had done that many times before, since your brother was the king of getting into fights back in his teenage years so you knew what to do.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was urging him to clean his face on the sink, blood and water running down the white tiles, as he held gauzes on his hand. You took them from him as he looked down at you asking you whether you were okay and to go back to bed but you shook your head, you wanted to help, so he let you take the kit and sat Jack on the toilet seat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you open your mouth for me?\u201d You asked him and he nodded, opening his mouth as you checked the back of his throat.\u00a0\u201cEddie can you give me the lighter on your phone?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You checked there was no blood on the back of his throat and then you urged him to blow his nose despite the pain. You touched his nose, hard and still, and he yelped and flinched so you smiled slightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not broken.\u201d You told Eddie.\u00a0\u201cBut\u2026 If you don\u2019t get better in a few days then you do need to go to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it. If I go to the doctor then it\u2019s over for me. I\u2026 I did something and it was about a fight again so if I go to the doctor because of another fight? That\u2019d be a relapse and I might even go to fucking jail.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You glanced at Harry as he placed his body in between Jack and you and you didn\u2019t fail to notice the way his shoulders were visibly tense, his jaw clenched as he put a hand down your leg, pulling you behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t say anything.\u201d You said as you got out ofHarry\u2019s protective shield.\u201dBut if you don\u2019t get better then\u2026 Then we\u2019ll see.\u201d You nodded before you got all the things you needed to clean Jack\u2019s wound and started working on it.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you two go get him some food and water and a couple advils? And maybe some ice too?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Eddie nodded and walked out of the bathroom, placing his hand on your back so he could pass, and Harry followed him behind, whispering to call if you felt even a slightly bit not safe which made you roll your eyes. You flinched at his contact though and he frowned and walked towards the kitchen. Eddie was making tea as he got peas out of the freezer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been fucking her?\u201d Eddie asked in a whisper.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Ed.\u201d Harry shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI love her.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo what does it change?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cYou said you loved Maggie as well and then you went to the States and forgot all about her. Have you told her?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 It\u2019s not the same, Ed. I was sixteen when that happened I didn\u2019t even know what love was. And no, I haven\u2019t told her\u00a0\u2018cause there\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, so the fact that you\u2019re fucking leaving again doesn\u2019t seem like something she needs to know?\u201d Eddie yelled.\u00a0\u201cListen I can\u2019t stop you from being an ass but I won\u2019t let you break Y/N\u2019s heart like it didn\u2019t matter! Because it does matter! She\u2019s\u2026 You don\u2019t deserve her.\u201d Eddie placed the kettle on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying, Ed.\u201d Harry said.\u00a0\u201cI got a job as a teacher in Uni. I\u2019m going to reject it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie frowned.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking staying because I don\u2019t want to lose her, okay? Listen things have been difficult enough. She\u2019s already left me once because of you so\u2026 For once you could I don\u2019t know not think of yourself first and fucking listen to her, make things easier. I love her, Eddie, and I know I have no right to love her but it feels right when I\u2019m with her so please just try to understand it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTry to understand it? You\u2019re telling me out of all the girls in the world you have to fuck my best friend and I have to understand it? That I have to understand that you\u2019ve been lying to me for God knows how long? You don\u2019t get to ask me to understand, Harry.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Jack walked inside the kitchen before you did and he gave you a smile when you took the seat next to him. You had been talking on the bathroom, kind of ended up coming up with a deal. He would help you with Eddie as a thank you for taking care of him. Sure he was on probation, but the other fight he had had had been a messed up way of trying to protect his little brother. He was getting bullied and the kids took it too far so he had <i>an encounter with the piece of shit </i>that was being mean. The last thing you\u2019d do would be justified violence, but you remembered when you were in high school and it was your own who was being bullied\u2026 You got it. Had you been a little stronger, you\u2019d have done the same.\u00a0</p><p>After having food enough to take the pills and lots of water by your demands, Jack made his way inside Eddie\u2019s bed and you asked Harry to give you some time with Eddie which he reluctantly do. You were doing the dishes when Eddie walked inside the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, thank you for\u2026 Taking care of Jack.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me for that.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cAbout what you saw before, I-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d Eddie said, clearing the table.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you at all.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gave you a stern look before he kept some things on the fridge and then he made his way inside his room, not adding anything else. You stood there like an idiot before you made your way to your own cabin through the beach, getting inside your bed with your feet covered in sand.\u00a0<br></p><p>The next morning you got downstairs pretty late, when your brother was having his second breakfast of the day after working out. You took some of the stawberry milkshake he had made.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry called me last night.\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cOr morning.. I don\u2019t know what time it was. He asked me to check if you were on your room. What the hell\u2019s been going on?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cEddie\u2019s just not talking to me.\u201d You sighed.\u00a0\u201cBut\u2026 Nothing\u2019s going on, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTalking about the devil.\u201d He raised his eyebrows as Harry walked your porch towards the cristal door to the living room and kitchen.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll leave you guys alone.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEddie said you guys talked things out last night.\u201d Harry said, standing in front of you.\u00a0\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk things out.\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cHe just said he didn\u2019t want to talk to me. He didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain myself.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell I talked to him before, when you were helping Jack, I\u2019m sure he will-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI just told him I love you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d You cried.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2026 I needed to talk to him first! You said you\u2019d respect that!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, baby, he\u2019s the one who didn\u2019t want to talk to you, not me, don\u2019t yell at me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the reason he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me! You had no right!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI had no right? Y/N you already ended things between us once and I respected that but why do I have to be the one who gives up here? I don\u2019t want to give you up!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou have no right to make me choose!\u201d You frowned.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one making you choose, Y/N, can\u2019t you see that? Eddie is! And still you yell at me? How is that fair? Do you even know how it feels like? To know I\u2019m clearly second here? How would you feel like if I let you know you\u2019re second to Louise? I\u2019m not the one making you choose, Y/N, but it still sucks that you choose him.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say. You didn\u2019t have to give anything up to be with me.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>His whole expression changed. He was about to say it, that he had said no to that job in New York so he could stay with you. But he bit his tongue, he looked down at the floor and counted to ten. <i>Don\u2019t speak when you\u2019re too mad or when you\u2019re too happy, </i>his mother\u2019s words replaying on his mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He nodded as you wiped the tear that had just scaped your eye and then he gently pulled you to his chest, afraid that you might push him away, but you didn\u2019t, you hugged him back and rested your face on his chest, letting him caress the low of your back before you looked up into his eyes and he leaned down to press a chaste kiss against your lips.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until a few days later when Eddie took a seat on the chair next to yours. You were reading your book, enjoying the nice evening breeze when he cleared his throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlaying the guitar without your mean girl comments is not the same.\u201d He let out which made you smile at him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAre you any better?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been three days.\u201d He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cAnd quite frankly I haven\u2019t been able to play much with Harry mopping around the house as if someone just died. He\u2019s really hurting.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d Your voice croaked.\u00a0\u201cYou said so yourself, he\u2019s not one to fall in love.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I thought but\u2026\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very sorry.\u201d He looked straight into your eyes.\u00a0\u201cAbout the way I came across about this. I\u2026\u00a0 I just didn\u2019t expect it. I mean I knew he had a thing for you, I live with him but\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d actually lie to me like that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know. I should have never. I\u2019m terribly sorry, I feel like shit.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo but, I mean I kind of proved you right didn\u2019t I? You didn\u2019t want to tell me because you thought I\u2019d lose my shit and I did so\u2026 I guess you were right.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have lied anyway. I should have told you I had feelings for him.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou love him too, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m with him I feel like everything is okay.\u201d You told your best friend.\u00a0\u201cBut they always say there\u2019s lots of men out there and not so many good friends so\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make you break up with anyone.\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not what friends do. I know I acted like an ass but.. I didn\u2019t want him to hurt you and at the same time I was afraid that you were going to pull far away from me.\u201d He smiled sadly.\u00a0\u201cBut\u2026 I mean sooner or later you\u2019re gonna have a boyfriend, yeah? And at least H knows who calls the shots here.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMe, clearly.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d He grinned, swatting your arm.\u00a0\u201cI just mean\u2026 I\u2019m sorry and\u2026 I won\u2019t be a problem for you two\u2026 You\u2019d have enough to deal with with my brother\u2019s shit without me adding any more drama. How much of a shitty boyfriend is he anyways?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, too much. I thought I could hear you talk about him like that but that\u2019s gross.\u201d He shut his eyes as you chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get better. I hope. I mean it\u2019s enough that he\u2019s not going to New York like if you add the heartbreak to that\u2026 Who would ever stand him?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s not going to New York?\u201d You frowned and Eddie sighed. You didn\u2019t know that. He shouldn\u2019t have said it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe got a job offer in New York in one of dad\u2019s friend\u2019s enterprise. He rejected it because he didn\u2019t want to go anymore.\u201d He shrugged as you smiled, tears brimming on the corners of your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>You knew he didn\u2019t want that job anyway. He didn\u2019t want to work for his dad or for anyone related to him. He wanted to be a lawyer, not a bussiness man, if possible he wanted to be a lawyer for those people in real need, so you were happy he had found the courage to say no and follow his heart.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd now you can go tell him I\u2019m the best best friend and brother ever and that you guys have my blessing.\u201d You got up as he moved aside for you to walk towards his cabin.\u00a0\u201cBut granted, don\u2019t kiss in front of me or anything weird.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You were grinning as you walked towards their house, calling his name from the entrance but no one came to greet you so you frowned as you made your way to his room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey stranger.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>He was listening to music, so he got his headphones off and got up from the mattress leaving his phone on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI just talked to Eddie, for real.\u201d You smiled and even though he didn\u2019t know what he had said, your smile was already giving you away.\u00a0\u201cHe said we couldn\u2019t <i>kiss in front of him or do anything weird</i>.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry laughed, walking towards you and pulling you in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut I can kiss you in my room.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d You nodded, waiting for his lips to press against yours until he did, with a smile he couldn\u2019t erase for the life of him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI fucking love you.\u201d He said as he lift you up and sat you on the small table near the door.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo but I mean that in like an I\u2019m-gonna-marry-you-someday way\u201d He peppered kisses along your neck as you chuckled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s really excited.\u201d You laughed.\u00a0\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhy do you smell so good?\u201d He sniffled the spot of your neck behind your ear as you laughed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, I have something I think you\u2019ll like.\u201d You smiled mischeviously and he grinned in anticipation.\u00a0<br></p><p>Without taking your eyes from him, you slowly took off your summer dress, showing him the pink lace set of underwear you had brought for him. His eyes almost fell from his eyeballs as the pink tinged your cheeks too.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>With that he grabbed you and lied you on his bed, hovering over you before he kissed every inch of skin, coming up to your lips to make out for the longest time before he even started touching you. He just wanted to kiss you first really, to feel your full lips and enjoy the taste of you without distractions but then when your sounds became too much, he slipped his fingers inside of you. He wanted to see you first, to have you all undone for him before he could lose his mind over you, so he moved his fingers in and out, repeting in his head <i>that you were his, that you were his, that you were made for him. </i>And you frowned and whined, tangling your fingers on his hair before you smiled, deliciously.\u00a0</p><p>When you were with him you felt like everything was okay.\u00a0</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You had yet to tell him. Eddie was currently playing the guitar on the floor of his room at the beach house as you lied on his fluffy white comforter. Eddie&rsquo;s mum had invited you over for the family holidays again but this time your family had decided to actually rent the cabin next door, so the four of you tagged along with The Styles for the holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>You had thought this would be the perfect time to tell Eddie for he would be close to the sea and he always said how much he loved the sea, how good the waves could do to a man so you thought he wouldn&rsquo;t be half as mad as he would had he been back home. He had decided he wanted to play the guitar just after seeing your brother playing on the porch late at night when your parents had already gone to their room. Their relationship was as messy as it could get, once they were apart and the next day they were back together but you had learnt to ignore that, to ignore them for the most part, and so in those summer nights you would stay with your brother on the porch reading a book as the ocean breeze hit the back of your neck and he played the guitar. And now Eddie wanted to learn, for some reason- maybe to enjoy more of your&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>hot brother&rsquo;s&rdquo; </i>company or maybe because all of a sudden he was suddenly interested in music. Yeah, probably the first one.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That was almost good.&rdquo; You told him as he smiled playfully at you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you keep that up I won&rsquo;t take you to any awards show.&rdquo; He shurgged and you laughed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I better change then. Chances are high you make it.&rdquo; You joked as he chuckled and rested his back on the wall, looking at you with the meaningul look only he could give you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He smiled.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to be here too.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He smiled before he resumed playing the guitar, thinking how happy he <i>really was</i> that you were there even though he had feared you coming on holidays with them. With each passing day, he was more and more certain of his brother&rsquo;s feelings for you and it made him worried sick- to think that he could ever be anything but friendly with you. It wasn&rsquo;t as if he was in love with you, not at all, that thought alone was almost repulsive- but you were the closest thing to a sister he had and only to think his brother could hurt you in any way? You flipped the page of your book and bumped with Harry&rsquo;s eyes when you looked ahead through the window to the beach, he was coming up to the house from the seashore and his green eyes were set on you, a big happy grin on his face.</p><p>He glanced over at his brother and rolled his eyes, pointing at his wrist as if he had an invisible watch and frowning;&nbsp;<i>it was his turn to have you,&nbsp;</i>which made you roll your eyes and smile. But he was right, you hadn&rsquo;t been alone with him all day and if you were being fair, you missed him as well so you showed him your tongue playfully and he brought his hand to his chest as if you had hit him, shaking his head with a smile before disappearing inside the house. All this time, Eddie had been frantically typing away on his phone so he stopped you right when you were going to bring it up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Eddie, there&rsquo;s something I need to-&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jack just asked me out.&rdquo; He raised his eyebrows.&nbsp;</p><p>He had met Jack just the day before, down at the beach, and they had instantly hit it off so you smiled at his good news, not having the energy to being annoyed about him not listening.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, Ed.&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What you have to tell me.&rdquo; He stared at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can it wait?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You nodded, standing from his bed and walking outside his room as he started getting ready for his date. You rested your head against his door as soon as you closed it and sighed. <i>Did he already know? You hadn&rsquo;t said you needed to tell him something, only that you needed to-&nbsp;</i></p><p>Walking inside the kitchen, you smiled at the sight of your secret boyfriend cutting watermelon and putting the pieces on a bowl. He was shirtless, light blue swimming trunks on his hips. He had spent the morning on the beach with his mum. You smiled as you rested your hip on the counter next to his fruit bowl and took a piece of watermelon, bringing it to your mouth and smirking as he watched you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hi stranger.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He smiled, looking around before pressing his hips against yours, trapping you against the counter with both hands on your sides as he leaned in to capture your lips with his. He hummed at the taste of cold watermelon water dripping from your lips and he pushed you once against the counter, thrusting his hips in a warning way when you teased him with your tongue.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Please tell me you don&rsquo;t have plans tonight.&rdquo; He whispered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You smiled, you had spent most of your time with Eddie or with your brother so it was true you had been depriving him of his<i> precious time alone with you</i> so you pecked his nose as you shook your head, making him grin as he squeezed your hip.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good then now you do.&rdquo; He smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to spend some alone time with my girl.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want to spend some time alone with you too.&rdquo; You whispered as he smiled and raised you up so you were sitting on the counter, his hands running up and down your naked thighs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t stop thinking about last night all day.&rdquo; He whispered,</p><p>for the night before you had stumbled over to his room, very late and kinda drunk, and you had asked him to shower with you, which had resulted in hot, hard thrusts on the shower that had left you walking funny for the whole morning after.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I could still feel you just hours ago.&rdquo; You whispered, knowing the effect it would have on him and he groaned, thrusting his hips against yours again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not anymore?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You stared into his eyes, shooking your head slowly as you played with the hem of this trunks. Maybe it was the adrenaline rush at the fear of getting caught, or maybe it was the safety of hearing Eddie&rsquo;s shower running as he sang but you were loving the way he was breathing, looking down at your small hands as your fingertips ran his skin under the hem.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you fix that, babe?&rdquo; You asked him, getting your fingertips dangerously closed to his groin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you make me feel you like that again?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Y/N. You&rsquo;re gonna drive me crazy.&rdquo; He whispered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You want me to stop?&rdquo; You smirked, your nails caressing the skin around his lenght.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want to fuck you against this counter.&rdquo; He whispered, making your breath hitched on your throat as he regained control of the situation.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to push you against the tile and fuck you so hard you&rsquo;ll feel me for a week. You would like that, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He smirked.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a tease, baby girl, but two can play this game.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He laughed at your flustered expression, lips parted, flushed cheeks and eyes wide, and he took your hand out of his trucks, pecking your lips sweetly a few times before he took the watermelon bowl and walked to the couch, putting on some TV right before his mum walked inside the house too, holding her white beach hat over her head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hi, Y/N, love.&rdquo; She smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Harry Edward Styles, did you just prepare some watermelon for yourself and not for Y/N? Where are your manners, boy?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough for her here, mum.&rdquo; He smirked.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sharing. She&rsquo;s tiny, can&rsquo;t you see her? She&rsquo;d probably have enough with just one piece.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; Anne frowned.&nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse the oldest, sometimes he seems the baby.&rdquo; He told you as you chuckled, hopping from the counter and walking towards the couch next to Harry.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Matty is the oldest.&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not in this room.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the oldest.&rdquo; He smiled.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to my room.&rdquo; She declared, staring into his eyes as if that had been enough as he laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Go get some of that fruit, Y/N. Where&rsquo;s Eddie?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She stopped and stared at the two of you with a suspicious look as he caught you dodging Harry&rsquo;s hand as you approached him on the couch. She smiled as he watched her own son, eyes sparkling and dimples out, and in that moment she loved you for that for she hadn&rsquo;t seen her son like that in a lot of time it seemed. You were laughing <i>stop Harry </i>before you replied to her question.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the shower.&rdquo; You smiled, shifting awkwardly as you tried to avoid Harry&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going out tonight.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh did that Jack guy ask him out?&rdquo; She asked and you nodded, chuckling.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna go check on him.&rdquo; She grinned, walking inside his room as you heard her playfully signing, teasing her youngest son about his date.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N you&rsquo;re a loudmouth!&rdquo; You laughed as you heard him yelling from his room.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mum ,stop! I&rsquo;m naked under this towel, woman!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>That was the last thing you heard before she closed the door. Had you been in Anne&rsquo;s mind, you would have known she was sitting on her son&rsquo;s bed, not only because she felt guilty about having left her sons behind in the city when she moved here with Robin, but also because she was afraid a problem was going to burst soon. If only she could talk to him, if she could make him understand that Y/N wasn&rsquo;t going to substitute him, that he was still a very, very important part of her life, just maybe not the <i>only </i>important guy anymore. She smiled at Eddie as he frowned at her, telling her she was <i>acting weird </i>as he got changed. <i>Just remember how much that girl loves you.&nbsp;</i></p><p>You were sitting on the couch next to Harry, your feet tucked under his thigh as your back rested on the other end of the sofa. Every time he would glance at you, you fought the urge of getting closer, for Eddie was to come out any minute now, and as much as you wanted to kiss him you couldn&rsquo;t risk it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so far away.&rdquo; He whispered, pouting dramatically and you rested your feet on his lap, making him roll his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to hold you, not your stinky feet.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey! They&rsquo;re not stinky!&rdquo;</p><p>You heard the snap of the camere of his phone as he cursed and chuckled.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you just take a picture of my feet? What is wrong with you?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, silly doll. I took a picture of your face. See?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He turned the phone to you and you frowned again as you saw the picture. You were frowing because he had said your feet were stinky and you didn&rsquo;t look pretty at all so you started blushing and tried to take the phone from him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on! Delete that immediately&rdquo; You said as he hovered over you, his phone on your back as he peppered small pecks along your skin.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is not gonna work!&rdquo; You chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deleting that photo!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He pulled away from you and rested his back on the couch as he pretended to bring his attention back to the movie and a second later you heard Eddie talking to his mum as he walked to the kitchen, grabbing a glass of water and rolling his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, mum, I know STDs are a thing. Geez.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes as both Harry and you chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like it is my first date ever, mum. Relax.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know, baby, I just worry. I&rsquo;m your mum.&rdquo; She smiled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Honey leave the boy alone.&rdquo; Robin walked towards the porch with a cup of tea and a book.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Robin. Thank God you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure, son. Have a ball.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Your brother wasn&rsquo;t having dinner at the cabin either, so you decided to listen to Harry&rsquo;s begs and left your parents have the closest thing to a date they&rsquo;d have these days as you had dinner with the Styles. Anne had made a big salad and she was sitting across from you when Harry placed his hand on your thigh under the table. He smiled at you when you gave him a warning look.&nbsp;</p><p>He was too close, the whole time he was too close, when you were helping Anne with the dishes and he would press his chest to your back playfully or when he would caress the skin on the back of your hand. You mentioned it once he closed the door of his room after himself and he just shrugged and walked towards you, pressing his lips against yours as he pulled you down on the bed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, baby.&rdquo; He said, a little out of the blue and you smiled on the kiss.</p><p>You tangled your fingers on his hair, pulling his mouth to you and diving your tongue inside his mouth, enjoying the now familiar taste, the always thrilling wetness, the warmth. He moaned against your mouth as he let you kissed him, kissing you back in a way that was letting you know he wanted it slow this time. So he gripped your hips to stop the movement when you started grining against his arousal.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ride me, Y/N.&rdquo; He whispered against your mouth.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>With that you rolled over, pushing him under you as you straddle him whilst he grinned widely, both hands on your hips. He was excited.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You are so perfect.&rdquo; You whispered, looking at every inch of skin of his face as he just smiled at you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You were getting wetter just thinking about sinking down on him as his lenght stretched you beyond belief. You couldn&rsquo;t wait to have him again and then the memory of the night before on his shower wouldn&rsquo;t leave your mind. He had never fucked you harder, the way he was thrusting inside you, reaching your belly as you moaned his name had you wet enough to drip on the lower part of his belly so you grind your hips a couple times against his hard on over his pyjama pants, watching a thin shiny coat covered the cotton.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Y/N I might come just looking at you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s strangled beg made you smile and then you undressed him as he ripped your panties- you had spent more money on panties on the last few months than on your entire life- and then you started teasing him, moving on top of him without getting him inside, sinking down just a little, so the tip would feel your wet walls and then moving up again, until he was about to cry so you soothed him by sinking down very slowly, moaning as his eyes rolled to the back of his head.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck baby, you feel so good.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You only moaned as a replied, running your nails down his chest as he hissed, bringing you down so he could kiss you. You gave in for a while, your lips parted over his as he breathed you in, but then your blood started boiling on your veins and no oxygen was enough so you lifted your chin so you could get air in as your belly started to burn as well. He didn&rsquo;t mind that time because as much as he liked kissing you, he knew you were about to come, and he couldn&rsquo;t think of a more pleasant sight. So he frowned as he tried to hold it in, <i>let her come first, let her come first </i>and he brought his fingers to your clit, stimullating that over sensitive part of you which made you lose the last bit of rational thought you had held on to and you rid him as you came, your sex becoming autonomous as it clenched around him, as if milking every single drop of him.&nbsp;</p><p>You fell asleep after round three, for you had stayed up talking and kissing until you ended up making love again. Twice. And so you were fast asleep, resting your head on his chest as he held you to him when Eddie burst inside the room.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, Harry I need your help.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He had been in a rush, he was worried about Jack&rsquo;s nose- <i>was it broken? </i>So he didn&rsquo;t knock or worry about his brother having some girl over, he wouldn&rsquo;t have them actually sleeping on his bed but everything stopped and everything started to stop making sense once he saw his shirless best friend lying on his brother&rsquo;s chest. His eyes opened widely and he felt the tears threatening to come out- <i>why hadn&rsquo;t she told him? Did she not want him to know? What sort of idiot did she think he was?&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;What is it, Eddie?&rdquo; He asked, pulling you back down on the bed before he talked to you.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, baby, go back to sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Eddie felt his heart break at the way his brother was acting around you, as if he truly&hellip; As if you were really his <i>baby </i>not his best friend anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s.. It&rsquo;s Jack. We got into a fight. Well, he got into a fight and his nose is bleeding like crazy and he doesn&rsquo;t want me to get him to the hospital&rdquo; All the time he was staring right into your eyes &ldquo;he says he&rsquo;s on probation or some shit and I don&rsquo;t know what to do, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, yeah, okay. I&rsquo;ll be out in a second.&rdquo; Harry got up from the bed, thank God he was wearing underpants, and he got dressed in cotton shorts and a t-shirt.&nbsp;&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Outside.&rdquo; Eddie said but still he didn&rsquo;t move as his brother rushed next to him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He stood there, staring into your eyes and looking down at his brother&rsquo;s shirt on you and you bit on your bottom lip, tears running down your cheeks as you felt all the guilt hitting you like a bag of bricks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; You asked him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He nodded, still in shock.&nbsp;&ldquo;I drove us here. He just&hellip; We got thrown away from a club for kissing and he just fought the bouncer, called him a homophobic shit and then&hellip; Yeah, it was bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ed?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Eddie turned his head when he heard Jack calling his name and you jumped out of the bed, poured some water on your face and got to the living room, decided to help them with the wound. You had done that many times before, since your brother was the king of getting into fights back in his teenage years so you knew what to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry was urging him to clean his face on the sink, blood and water running down the white tiles, as he held gauzes on his hand. You took them from him as he looked down at you asking you whether you were okay and to go back to bed but you shook your head, you wanted to help, so he let you take the kit and sat Jack on the toilet seat.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you open your mouth for me?&rdquo; You asked him and he nodded, opening his mouth as you checked the back of his throat.&nbsp;&ldquo;Eddie can you give me the lighter on your phone?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You checked there was no blood on the back of his throat and then you urged him to blow his nose despite the pain. You touched his nose, hard and still, and he yelped and flinched so you smiled slightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably not broken.&rdquo; You told Eddie.&nbsp;&ldquo;But&hellip; If you don&rsquo;t get better in a few days then you do need to go to the doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t get it. If I go to the doctor then it&rsquo;s over for me. I&hellip; I did something and it was about a fight again so if I go to the doctor because of another fight? That&rsquo;d be a relapse and I might even go to fucking jail.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You glanced at Harry as he placed his body in between Jack and you and you didn&rsquo;t fail to notice the way his shoulders were visibly tense, his jaw clenched as he put a hand down your leg, pulling you behind him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo; You said as you got out ofHarry&rsquo;s protective shield.&rdquo;But if you don&rsquo;t get better then&hellip; Then we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; You nodded before you got all the things you needed to clean Jack&rsquo;s wound and started working on it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you two go get him some food and water and a couple advils? And maybe some ice too?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Eddie nodded and walked out of the bathroom, placing his hand on your back so he could pass, and Harry followed him behind, whispering to call if you felt even a slightly bit not safe which made you roll your eyes. You flinched at his contact though and he frowned and walked towards the kitchen. Eddie was making tea as he got peas out of the freezer.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been fucking her?&rdquo; Eddie asked in a whisper.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that, Ed.&rdquo; Harry shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love her.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So what does it change?&rdquo; He asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;You said you loved Maggie as well and then you went to the States and forgot all about her. Have you told her?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not&hellip; It&rsquo;s not the same, Ed. I was sixteen when that happened I didn&rsquo;t even know what love was. And no, I haven&rsquo;t told her&nbsp;&lsquo;cause there&rsquo;s nothing to say.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so the fact that you&rsquo;re fucking leaving again doesn&rsquo;t seem like something she needs to know?&rdquo; Eddie yelled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen I can&rsquo;t stop you from being an ass but I won&rsquo;t let you break Y/N&rsquo;s heart like it didn&rsquo;t matter! Because it does matter! She&rsquo;s&hellip; You don&rsquo;t deserve her.&rdquo; Eddie placed the kettle on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying, Ed.&rdquo; Harry said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I got a job as a teacher in Uni. I&rsquo;m going to reject it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Eddie frowned.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fucking staying because I don&rsquo;t want to lose her, okay? Listen things have been difficult enough. She&rsquo;s already left me once because of you so&hellip; For once you could I don&rsquo;t know not think of yourself first and fucking listen to her, make things easier. I love her, Eddie, and I know I have no right to love her but it feels right when I&rsquo;m with her so please just try to understand it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Try to understand it? You&rsquo;re telling me out of all the girls in the world you have to fuck my best friend and I have to understand it? That I have to understand that you&rsquo;ve been lying to me for God knows how long? You don&rsquo;t get to ask me to understand, Harry.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Jack walked inside the kitchen before you did and he gave you a smile when you took the seat next to him. You had been talking on the bathroom, kind of ended up coming up with a deal. He would help you with Eddie as a thank you for taking care of him. Sure he was on probation, but the other fight he had had had been a messed up way of trying to protect his little brother. He was getting bullied and the kids took it too far so he had <i>an encounter with the piece of shit </i>that was being mean. The last thing you&rsquo;d do would be justified violence, but you remembered when you were in high school and it was your own who was being bullied&hellip; You got it. Had you been a little stronger, you&rsquo;d have done the same.&nbsp;</p><p>After having food enough to take the pills and lots of water by your demands, Jack made his way inside Eddie&rsquo;s bed and you asked Harry to give you some time with Eddie which he reluctantly do. You were doing the dishes when Eddie walked inside the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, thank you for&hellip; Taking care of Jack.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me for that.&rdquo; You shook your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;About what you saw before, I-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about it.&rdquo; Eddie said, clearing the table.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you at all.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He gave you a stern look before he kept some things on the fridge and then he made his way inside his room, not adding anything else. You stood there like an idiot before you made your way to your own cabin through the beach, getting inside your bed with your feet covered in sand.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The next morning you got downstairs pretty late, when your brother was having his second breakfast of the day after working out. You took some of the stawberry milkshake he had made.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry called me last night.&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Or morning.. I don&rsquo;t know what time it was. He asked me to check if you were on your room. What the hell&rsquo;s been going on?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; You shook your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Eddie&rsquo;s just not talking to me.&rdquo; You sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;But&hellip; Nothing&rsquo;s going on, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Talking about the devil.&rdquo; He raised his eyebrows as Harry walked your porch towards the cristal door to the living room and kitchen.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you guys alone.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Eddie said you guys talked things out last night.&rdquo; Harry said, standing in front of you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why did you leave?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t talk things out.&rdquo; You frowned.&nbsp;&ldquo;He just said he didn&rsquo;t want to talk to me. He didn&rsquo;t even give me a chance to explain myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I talked to him before, when you were helping Jack, I&rsquo;m sure he will-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You did what?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I just told him I love you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why would you do that?&rdquo; You cried.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&hellip; I needed to talk to him first! You said you&rsquo;d respect that!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, baby, he&rsquo;s the one who didn&rsquo;t want to talk to you, not me, don&rsquo;t yell at me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re the reason he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk to me! You had no right!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I had no right? Y/N you already ended things between us once and I respected that but why do I have to be the one who gives up here? I don&rsquo;t want to give you up!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You have no right to make me choose!&rdquo; You frowned.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the one making you choose, Y/N, can&rsquo;t you see that? Eddie is! And still you yell at me? How is that fair? Do you even know how it feels like? To know I&rsquo;m clearly second here? How would you feel like if I let you know you&rsquo;re second to Louise? I&rsquo;m not the one making you choose, Y/N, but it still sucks that you choose him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy for you to say. You didn&rsquo;t have to give anything up to be with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>His whole expression changed. He was about to say it, that he had said no to that job in New York so he could stay with you. But he bit his tongue, he looked down at the floor and counted to ten. <i>Don&rsquo;t speak when you&rsquo;re too mad or when you&rsquo;re too happy, </i>his mother&rsquo;s words replaying on his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Y/N.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He nodded as you wiped the tear that had just scaped your eye and then he gently pulled you to his chest, afraid that you might push him away, but you didn&rsquo;t, you hugged him back and rested your face on his chest, letting him caress the low of your back before you looked up into his eyes and he leaned down to press a chaste kiss against your lips.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until a few days later when Eddie took a seat on the chair next to yours. You were reading your book, enjoying the nice evening breeze when he cleared his throat.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Playing the guitar without your mean girl comments is not the same.&rdquo; He let out which made you smile at him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you any better?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been three days.&rdquo; He shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;And quite frankly I haven&rsquo;t been able to play much with Harry mopping around the house as if someone just died. He&rsquo;s really hurting.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get over it.&rdquo; Your voice croaked.&nbsp;&ldquo;You said so yourself, he&rsquo;s not one to fall in love.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah that&rsquo;s what I thought but&hellip;&rdquo; He sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry.&rdquo; He looked straight into your eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;About the way I came across about this. I&hellip;&nbsp; I just didn&rsquo;t expect it. I mean I knew he had a thing for you, I live with him but&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d actually lie to me like that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know. I should have never. I&rsquo;m terribly sorry, I feel like shit.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No but, I mean I kind of proved you right didn&rsquo;t I? You didn&rsquo;t want to tell me because you thought I&rsquo;d lose my shit and I did so&hellip; I guess you were right.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have lied anyway. I should have told you I had feelings for him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You love him too, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m with him I feel like everything is okay.&rdquo; You told your best friend.&nbsp;&ldquo;But they always say there&rsquo;s lots of men out there and not so many good friends so&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make you break up with anyone.&rdquo; Eddie said.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what friends do. I know I acted like an ass but.. I didn&rsquo;t want him to hurt you and at the same time I was afraid that you were going to pull far away from me.&rdquo; He smiled sadly.&nbsp;&ldquo;But&hellip; I mean sooner or later you&rsquo;re gonna have a boyfriend, yeah? And at least H knows who calls the shots here.&rdquo; He smiled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me, clearly.&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Clearly.&rdquo; He grinned, swatting your arm.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just mean&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry and&hellip; I won&rsquo;t be a problem for you two&hellip; You&rsquo;d have enough to deal with with my brother&rsquo;s shit without me adding any more drama. How much of a shitty boyfriend is he anyways?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; You chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, too much. I thought I could hear you talk about him like that but that&rsquo;s gross.&rdquo; He shut his eyes as you chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get better. I hope. I mean it&rsquo;s enough that he&rsquo;s not going to New York like if you add the heartbreak to that&hellip; Who would ever stand him?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;s not going to New York?&rdquo; You frowned and Eddie sighed. You didn&rsquo;t know that. He shouldn&rsquo;t have said it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He got a job offer in New York in one of dad&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s enterprise. He rejected it because he didn&rsquo;t want to go anymore.&rdquo; He shrugged as you smiled, tears brimming on the corners of your eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>You knew he didn&rsquo;t want that job anyway. He didn&rsquo;t want to work for his dad or for anyone related to him. He wanted to be a lawyer, not a bussiness man, if possible he wanted to be a lawyer for those people in real need, so you were happy he had found the courage to say no and follow his heart.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And now you can go tell him I&rsquo;m the best best friend and brother ever and that you guys have my blessing.&rdquo; You got up as he moved aside for you to walk towards his cabin.&nbsp;&ldquo;But granted, don&rsquo;t kiss in front of me or anything weird.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You were grinning as you walked towards their house, calling his name from the entrance but no one came to greet you so you frowned as you made your way to his room.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey stranger.&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He was listening to music, so he got his headphones off and got up from the mattress leaving his phone on the bed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I just talked to Eddie, for real.&rdquo; You smiled and even though he didn&rsquo;t know what he had said, your smile was already giving you away.&nbsp;&ldquo;He said we couldn&rsquo;t <i>kiss in front of him or do anything weird</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Harry laughed, walking towards you and pulling you in for a hug.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But I can kiss you in my room.&rdquo; He smiled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can.&rdquo; You nodded, waiting for his lips to press against yours until he did, with a smile he couldn&rsquo;t erase for the life of him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I fucking love you.&rdquo; He said as he lift you up and sat you on the small table near the door.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No but I mean that in like an I&rsquo;m-gonna-marry-you-someday way&rdquo; He peppered kisses along your neck as you chuckled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s really excited.&rdquo; You laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you smell so good?&rdquo; He sniffled the spot of your neck behind your ear as you laughed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I have something I think you&rsquo;ll like.&rdquo; You smiled mischeviously and he grinned in anticipation.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Without taking your eyes from him, you slowly took off your summer dress, showing him the pink lace set of underwear you had brought for him. His eyes almost fell from his eyeballs as the pink tinged your cheeks too.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me.&rdquo; He whispered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>With that he grabbed you and lied you on his bed, hovering over you before he kissed every inch of skin, coming up to your lips to make out for the longest time before he even started touching you. He just wanted to kiss you first really, to feel your full lips and enjoy the taste of you without distractions but then when your sounds became too much, he slipped his fingers inside of you. He wanted to see you first, to have you all undone for him before he could lose his mind over you, so he moved his fingers in and out, repeting in his head <i>that you were his, that you were his, that you were made for him. </i>And you frowned and whined, tangling your fingers on his hair before you smiled, deliciously.&nbsp;</p><p>When you were with him you felt like everything was okay.&nbsp;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure>\n<p>You had yet to tell him. Eddie was currently playing the guitar on the floor of his room at the beach house as you lied on his fluffy white comforter. Eddie&rsquo;s mum had invited you over for the family holidays again but this time your family had decided to actually rent the cabin next door, so the four of you tagged along with The Styles for the holidays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You had thought this would be the perfect time to tell Eddie for he would be close to the sea and he always said how much he loved the sea, how good the waves could do to a man so you thought he wouldn&rsquo;t be half as mad as he would had he been back home. He had decided he wanted to play the guitar just after seeing your brother playing on the porch late at night when your parents had already gone to their room. Their relationship was as messy as it could get, once they were apart and the next day they were back together but you had learnt to ignore that, to ignore them for the most part, and so in those summer nights you would stay with your brother on the porch reading a book as the ocean breeze hit the back of your neck and he played the guitar. And now Eddie wanted to learn, for some reason- maybe to enjoy more of your&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>hot brother&rsquo;s&rdquo; </i>company or maybe because all of a sudden he was suddenly interested in music. Yeah, probably the first one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That was almost good.&rdquo; You told him as he smiled playfully at you.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you keep that up I won&rsquo;t take you to any awards show.&rdquo; He shurgged and you laughed.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n</p>",
