Her attitude obviously irritated him, but at the same time amused him and turned him on just as much.</p><p>\u201cAn <i>asshole</i>,\u201d she repeated with great emphasis. \u201cA condescending asshole.\u201d</p><p>It was funny how neither of them remembered what started the fight. It began with a conversation about her uni project when all of a sudden it turned into an argument. From his car to her bedroom, still the fight showed no sign of stopping. This surely wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d fought about something so insignificant, for they tend to disagree on a whole lot of things.</p><p>\u201cIt takes one to know one, right?\u201d He said only to receive a death glare from Y/N. \u201cWhy are you so offended? You started it.\u201d</p><p>The way she huffed and placed her hands on her hips made him smirk, he wanted nothing more than to kiss her right now.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she said underneath her breath. But as she turned away, he was quick to grab her by the arm and spin her around. </p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered, one hand holding her chin. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just charm your way out of another fight, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>Harry could tell the way he raised his eyebrow made her go soft though she would never admit it. So he held her face, pecking her cheeks then both corners of her lips. In a heartbeat, her frown turned into a smile. She could say whatever she wanted, but the way her body reacted to his touch already gave herself away.

A few months ago I was diagnosed with a panic disorder and depression. My anxiety was at peak in the last half a year, and I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. I know it\u2019s a place where I can talk about it, today it\u2019s not a shame to share something like this and it feels good. But in real life it\u2019s hard to explain to my friends and family why I have no energy, why I don\u2019t have a\u00a0\u2018real\u2019 job, why I do things and don\u2019t do others. The rollercoaster goes up and down and sometimes spends more time down than up. I don\u2019t like using the word anxiety, because it\u2019s so comon now that it lost what it means to someone with an anxiety or panic disorder. It\u2019s not just stressing about things.

Anything. I still love the stories I wrote, I still want to update, but now I\u2019m unable to do that. I don\u2019t have the ohysical and mental energy to sit down and finish a story.

I know he he has been to lots of gay bars, but this one might be set up on purpose; they might slowly work it up to a coming out. I think Mike might be someone from the team too, someone who would do this to get Harry out there. Maybe even a friend. However I do think he was only there to take the pic.

As she\u2019s about to turn on her side lamp, she notices it\u2019s closer to 3am on her quiet radio when suddenly he says in almost a slur of words \u201cdon\u2019t turn on the lamp!\u201d  She can see his shadow from the streetlight in front of their window walking towards her. He has on a ski mask on top of his head which is weird she thinks considering it\u2019s a hot late September night. </p><p>\u201cHi my sweet girl, I didn\u2019t believe Mitch when he told me you were leaving for the night.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI told you myself I was going home, my stockings for my outfit wouldn\u2019t stay up anymore after my garter belt broke. And I got tired of looking like a hot mess with one part riding down.\u201d She pouted, waiting for a kiss. Harry leaned down and gave her a soft kiss as Y/N smelt a bit of liquor on his lips. \u201cHow did you get home if you\u2019re  drunk? Please tell me you left the car and didn\u2019t drive!\u201d \u201c I only had 2 beers and two shot of disaronno, but yes my love I left the car and got a ride. Didn\u2019t want to fight with my sweet little bo peep when I got home.\u201d \u201c I was dressed as little red riding hood. That\u2019s why I had a red cape!\u201d She sighed quietly.</p><p>Harry just nodded his head and smiled at her as he turned around and started digging into his top dresser. \u201cWhat are you doing\u201d  Y/N asked fixing her white t-shirt she was wearing, \u201cplease shower before you get into bed you smell like sweat!\u201d \u201cSorry sweet girl you\u2019re not the boss tonight.\u201d Harry said as he turned around and walked towards the bed and grabbed Y/N\u2019s left wrist. That\u2019s when Y/N noticed he was holding the fuzzy pink handcuffs he got as a joke on his birthday. they use them on the rare occasion.</p><p>\u201cHarry I\u2019m tired it\u2019s going on 3am!\u201d Y/N whined. </p><p>\u201cHush pet. We\u2019re going to play a naughty little game hmm? Me the nasty burglar expecting the house to be empty on a Saturday night, and you the good girl, home alone sleeping so sweetly till she\u2019s rudely woken up.\u201d \u201cSo the truth then? Because I was being a good girl sleeping so nicely till you stomped in here!\u201d She grumbled at him. Harry chuckled \u201cthat\u2019s enough out of you. Now. Where\u2019s that\u2019s roll of duct tape from earlier?\u201d  \u201cWhat do you need duct tape for\u201d Y/N asked almost quietly. \u201cAre you talking about the that little roll I had when I was fixing the edge of the shower curtain? Cause there\u2019s like 4 inches left on there I swear, so i don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna do with it.\u201d She grumbled as he stalked into the en-suite bathroom. She heard him rummage around in the bins under the sink and then silence as he walked back towards her on the bed. \u201cNow\u201d he started \u201ccontinuing with our game, I\u2019m the big mean old burglar, whose going to torture you into giving him the passcode to the safe in the closet\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you need into the safe mr meanie?\u201d Y/N said becoming more awake and rubbing at Harrys thigh with her foot. \u201cUh huh sweetheart\u201d. He said as he tried to find the edge of the tape, after succeeding and pulling he saw there was only a tiny bit like she said a little bit longer than his  pointer finger. \u201cTold you so\u201d she replied with a smug grin. \u201c okay change of plans\u201d Harry grunted and took the tape and slapped it over Y/N mouth. \u201cNow, since you can\u2019t say our safe word I\u2019ll need you to hit your hands against the metal bar on the headboard and I\u2019ll stop right away. Is this okay with you?\u201d She nodded excitedly. \u201cAlright then let\u2019s begin\u201d.  </p>",
