They were lying at opposite ends as the candles burned low and began to gutter. </p><p>\u201cWhat about this time?\u201d he replied. His fingers trailed along her calf until she pulled it away and crawled towards him. She straddled his waist and pressed her hand over the scar above his heart.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know about these scars,\u201d she said and moved her hand to his face. Her finger traced along the scar around his right eye and then the scar above and below his left eye. \u201cTell me about these.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re from different things. The ones here are from an eagle who clawed at my eyes. I used to have one that matched over my right eye but they\u2019re faded more.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder you still have your sight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he nodded and glanced up at her sheepishly. </p><p>\u201cDid you just make a joke?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd the other one? This one looks more recent. Another scar from your brothers in the Watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That one is from fighting one of <i>them</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d she repeated, the realization not immediately dawning on her, but when it did she was take aback. Her voice was little more than a whisper. \u201cOh. One of the White Walkers.\u201d </p><p>He nodded and lowered his eyes. </p><p>\u201cDid he touch you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe threw me around a bit. I fell through a floor. I think that\u2019s when I got it. It\u2019s hard to be sure though. He didn\u2019t touch my bare skin.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026what happens if one of them touches you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope I never find out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to defeat them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied, trying to smile. \u201cYou did promise me. I intend to hold you to that promise.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the one holding <i>you</i>,\u201d she said, placing her hands on his shoulder as she changed the subject. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I couldn\u2019t change that if I wanted to?\u201d</p><p>He could. She knew that he could. Although she had told Tyrion that he was too little for her, that was far from the truth. He was strong and could easily lift her if he wanted or needed to. </p><p>\u201cOh you could, but you don\u2019t want to. Do you?\u201d </p><p>His fingertips pressed into her hips and for a brief moment she thought he would flip them so she was on her back, but he did not. She smiled and leaned down to kiss him, her hair falling like a curtain around them. Her tongue flicked across his bottom lip before darting into his mouth and sparring with his. She had never made love to anyone who could anticipate her every move the way he did. He was such an eager lover and eager to please her. Over the course of their nights together she learned that he had only been with one other woman, the Wildling he had loved. It was hard to believe and yet not, given his character. In any case, he was the most unselfish lover she had ever known, it made her happy to lavish him with attention. <br></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17531525\"><b>Read the rest on AO3 <br></b></a></p><p>(As always, let me know if the link isn\u2019t working.

                "content": "<p>From their interactions in s6, it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s told her about what happened to him, why he was murdered, that he&rsquo;s been resurrected etc. So, I think that was running through her mind.&nbsp;</p><p>When Sansa suggests that the castles should go to new families, loyal families, the gathered lords and ladies agree. She&rsquo;s not delivering some odd, controversial solution no one&rsquo;s ever heard of but instead bringing some sense to the table after Royce&rsquo;s emotional, &ldquo;Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing!&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s suggestion, however, <i>is</i> controversial. This is not how things usually are done. Even as Jon and Sansa each argue their point, people still agree with her. The castles should go to new families, families of the men who died fighting for Jon. When Jon states that he&rsquo;s made his decision and his decision is final, no one murmurs or bangs their cups in the table in agreement. At least not until Ned Umber and Alys Karstark swear fealty.</p><p>To my modern ears, Jon&rsquo;s suggestion is better and kinder, but I still understand Sansa&rsquo;s worry here. Jon has been named king even though he&rsquo;s a bastard. She knows how quickly loyalties can shift. She knows what happened the last time Jon made a controversial and modern&nbsp;&ldquo;yesterday&rsquo;s wars don&rsquo;t matter anymore and everyone needs to band together&rdquo; type of decision. He was murdered for it and she doesn&rsquo;t want that to happen again because she loves him.</p><p>So I think she was only about to remind him of how easy it is to lose respect when you make too many unpopular decisions.
