Hope it&rsquo;s okay! </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>TJ Kippen, </p><p>Ever since I met you, you&rsquo;ve been a mystery to me. Outside the Red Rooster, when I stood there with Buffy, you looked exactly how you had been described to me. Tough, scary, mean. That&rsquo;s probably why I flinched away from you when you walked up to Buffy that morning. But man, was I wrong. </p><p>I would talk about the muffin if it wasn&rsquo;t such a blue from the pure euphoria I felt holding it in my hands. But the swings are when I saw it for the first time. You weren&rsquo;t mean, even to a dork like me. You were nice, sweet. But you looked sad. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I told you about swinging, because it still surprises me to this day how I didn&rsquo;t run from there screaming in fear when you walked up to me. But I&rsquo;m glad I stayed. Because I found someone who would become one of the most important people in my life. </p><p>And life has thrown us through everything. With the whole drama with Buffy, the gun, the Costume Day fiasco, life has put us and our relationship through everything you could think of. So much so that there was a point when I almost accepted that, whatever you and I had, whether it be friendship or the possibility of anything more, was nothing more than a lost dream. But every single time, you and I found our ways back to each other. And we just grew stronger, and closer. We showed the world that we would always stick by each other. </p><p>The day you told me you liked me the same way I did was nothing short of unbelievable. TJ Kippen, basketball captain, dirt-biker snd all around amazing and cool guy, liked me, Cyrus Goodman. But there you were, sitting beside me on the bench as Andi&rsquo;s party went on in the background, and you held my hand and told me you liked me. I would say that was the craziest day of my life, but I&rsquo;d be lying. Every day I get to spend with someone as incredible as you as my boyfriend is crazy to me. I need you to know that. </p><p>Why am I talking about this? Because these, among so many other things, are the good things. Other ones I can name just off the top of my head are you teaching me a somersault, us at the Spoon, you trying but failing to teach me basketball, you and me sneaking out of our houses just to grab ice cream at 2 am. They&rsquo;re good things right? To me they are. And to me they are worth staying and fighting for. </p><p>I know you&rsquo;re scared. Hell, I&rsquo;m scared. And this is a mess. I&rsquo;m not gonna sugarcoat it. And I know that makes you scared to stay, to stick it out. Because who wouldn&rsquo;t be? What Dylan did was unacceptable, from why and what he did, to the manner he did it. Only you get to decide who you tell and when, and he took that away from you. If it&rsquo;s any consolation, Marty jumped him in school today, and Reed joined in too. I wouldve too, but I&rsquo;m a true kugel of a man. I hope that at least made you laugh for a second. Also, Dr Metcalf suspended him and severely punished him, even calling his parents, making the statement that if and when you return to school, he will &lsquo;support you unconditionally in any way you need&rsquo;. Also you will have all of us. </p><p>Still, I understand if this still doesn&rsquo;t ease your mind. Because I know the panic and fear you are feeling right now. But need you to stay, TJ. Running away and leaving it all behind sounds good, but trust me it won&rsquo;t work. We can make it work, and we&rsquo;ve put in too much effort to throw it all away. We can make this mess better. I can&rsquo;t promise itll be immediate, or overnight. But I know we can do it. </p><p>And one day itll be better, and all the bricks that have been thrown at us and our relationship, we can make it like home. And you won&rsquo;t have to keep skeletons in your closet, you can bury them deep in the ground and smile. And I&rsquo;ll be there with you through it all. Through the good, the bad and the fucking worst. Because you&rsquo;re worth it to me. </p><p>I know you need your space, but please don&rsquo;t leave. Stay. Cuz if you stay, we can make it through together, and I&rsquo;ll stand by you. And even though I&rsquo;m weak, I&rsquo;ll fight anyone who tries to hurt you. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ll read this, or Amber is gonna return this to me with a sad smile, still unopened. But I like to think that you&rsquo;ll read this and hold it to yourself, knowing that I&rsquo;m with you through everything. </p><p>What can I say? I&rsquo;m just a boy with the silver lining, loving his boy with the cinderblock garden.The boy who has his feet on the ground, who needs to look up ever once in a while. </p><p>Yeah. I love you, TJ. And I&rsquo;m right here whenever you&rsquo;re ready. </p><p>Love, </p><p>Cyrus.</p><p>~~~~~~~ </p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry if it isn&rsquo;t great</i></p><p><b>Send me prompts for fics! </b></p>",

Hope it\u2019s okay! </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>TJ Kippen, </p><p>Ever since I met you, you\u2019ve been a mystery to me. Outside the Red Rooster, when I stood there with Buffy, you looked exactly how you had been described to me. Tough, scary, mean. That\u2019s probably why I flinched away from you when you walked up to Buffy that morning. But man, was I wrong. </p><p>I would talk about the muffin if it wasn\u2019t such a blue from the pure euphoria I felt holding it in my hands. But the swings are when I saw it for the first time. You weren\u2019t mean, even to a dork like me. You were nice, sweet. But you looked sad. Maybe that\u2019s why I told you about swinging, because it still surprises me to this day how I didn\u2019t run from there screaming in fear when you walked up to me. But I\u2019m glad I stayed. Because I found someone who would become one of the most important people in my life. </p><p>And life has thrown us through everything. With the whole drama with Buffy, the gun, the Costume Day fiasco, life has put us and our relationship through everything you could think of. So much so that there was a point when I almost accepted that, whatever you and I had, whether it be friendship or the possibility of anything more, was nothing more than a lost dream. But every single time, you and I found our ways back to each other. And we just grew stronger, and closer. We showed the world that we would always stick by each other. </p><p>The day you told me you liked me the same way I did was nothing short of unbelievable. TJ Kippen, basketball captain, dirt-biker snd all around amazing and cool guy, liked me, Cyrus Goodman. But there you were, sitting beside me on the bench as Andi\u2019s party went on in the background, and you held my hand and told me you liked me. I would say that was the craziest day of my life, but I\u2019d be lying. Every day I get to spend with someone as incredible as you as my boyfriend is crazy to me. I need you to know that. </p><p>Why am I talking about this? Because these, among so many other things, are the good things. Other ones I can name just off the top of my head are you teaching me a somersault, us at the Spoon, you trying but failing to teach me basketball, you and me sneaking out of our houses just to grab ice cream at 2 am. They\u2019re good things right? To me they are. And to me they are worth staying and fighting for. </p><p>I know you\u2019re scared. Hell, I\u2019m scared. And this is a mess. I\u2019m not gonna sugarcoat it. And I know that makes you scared to stay, to stick it out. Because who wouldn\u2019t be? What Dylan did was unacceptable, from why and what he did, to the manner he did it. Only you get to decide who you tell and when, and he took that away from you. If it\u2019s any consolation, Marty jumped him in school today, and Reed joined in too. I wouldve too, but I\u2019m a true kugel of a man. I hope that at least made you laugh for a second. Also, Dr Metcalf suspended him and severely punished him, even calling his parents, making the statement that if and when you return to school, he will \u2018support you unconditionally in any way you need\u2019. Also you will have all of us. </p><p>Still, I understand if this still doesn\u2019t ease your mind. Because I know the panic and fear you are feeling right now. But need you to stay, TJ. Running away and leaving it all behind sounds good, but trust me it won\u2019t work. We can make it work, and we\u2019ve put in too much effort to throw it all away. We can make this mess better. I can\u2019t promise itll be immediate, or overnight. But I know we can do it. </p><p>And one day itll be better, and all the bricks that have been thrown at us and our relationship, we can make it like home. And you won\u2019t have to keep skeletons in your closet, you can bury them deep in the ground and smile. And I\u2019ll be there with you through it all. Through the good, the bad and the fucking worst. Because you\u2019re worth it to me. </p><p>I know you need your space, but please don\u2019t leave. Stay. Cuz if you stay, we can make it through together, and I\u2019ll stand by you. And even though I\u2019m weak, I\u2019ll fight anyone who tries to hurt you. </p><p>I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll read this, or Amber is gonna return this to me with a sad smile, still unopened. But I like to think that you\u2019ll read this and hold it to yourself, knowing that I\u2019m with you through everything. </p><p>What can I say? I\u2019m just a boy with the silver lining, loving his boy with the cinderblock garden.The boy who has his feet on the ground, who needs to look up ever once in a while. </p><p>Yeah. I love you, TJ. And I\u2019m right here whenever you\u2019re ready. </p><p>Love, </p><p>Cyrus.</p><p>~~~~~~~ </p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry if it isn\u2019t great</i></p><p><b>Send me prompts for fics! </b></p></p>",
