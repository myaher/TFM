        "answer": "<p><i><b>Hi, I love boxer!Tom. There&rsquo;s a TINY sexual reference towards the end. And mentions of blood and beatings. </b></i></p><p><!-- more --></p><p>The only thing that flashes in Tom&rsquo;s mind as he backs you into the locker room with his lips presses to yours is that damn blush that crept to your cheeks when Harrison called you sweetheart and winked at you. There was no denying Tom&rsquo;s opponent was attractive and you had no idea that he and Tom were the worst of enemies. The way he looked, glistening in sweat, gash with butterfly bandages across his cheek, soft, long lashes fluttering as he leaned across the bungee cords to talk to you, it was all in good fun you thought. But the way Tom saw you bat your own lashes made pure envy, red hot, course through Tom&rsquo;s veins. And it&rsquo;s part of the reason Tom had to be peeled from a knocked out Harrison after he&rsquo;d won the match. </p><p>Shoving at his shoulders, he releases you, watching you push yourself off the end of the lockers and pace away from him, dress and curled hair flowing out behind you. He admires the way you run your hand over your lips, attempting to rid yourself of the taste of him. You swallow, reaching down to rub your wrist where he grabbed you just after the match, dragging you off down the semi-lit hallway towards the locker room,</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; You ask softly, voice devoid of any emotion Tom can decipher. He swallows, wondering if you&rsquo;ll continue or if the question is the first one to answer before you continue. But you breathe before speaking again,</p><p>&ldquo;All that blood. The way you just&hellip; kept going after he was knocked out its just&hellip; disgusting. I&rsquo;m remembering why I hated coming to see these fights.&rdquo; Your eyes find his as you cross one arm across yourself in defense. The look in your eyes breaks Tom and he wants to cry in rage, frustration, sadness, jealousy. He DESPISES the way Harrison looked at you. And the way you enjoyed it. When he purses his lips, your lashes flutter,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; I let my anger get the best of me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your anger? What anger? What are you mad about?&rdquo; When he looks up from his hands, blood drying on the tape, your eyebrows have furrowed in worry. He looks down again, lips pursed, </p><p>&ldquo;He- he flirted&hellip; with you. And you- you liked it.&rdquo; He blinks the stinging behind his eyes away. He can&rsquo;t cry. You&rsquo;ll think he&rsquo;s pathetic and you&rsquo;ll leave him and that&rsquo;s the last thing he needs right now when he&rsquo;s just been through one of the most mentally, emotionally exhausting fights of his life. He glances at your heels when you approach him again, guiding his chin up with a finger under it. He looks all over your face, lips in a line, </p><p>&ldquo;How do you know I liked it? Sure&hellip; he&rsquo;s attractive but&hellip; I&rsquo;m yours. I have been for two years. No one, especially him, is taking me from you.&rdquo; You reach up to hold his cheeks, eyes finding the cuts in his lip. He purses his lips as best he can with your hands holding his face. He nods and sighs, </p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;M sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the one you should be apologizing to. You just knocked him unconscious and kept going.&rdquo; You step again and Tom&rsquo;s body screams for the affection again. But you pace away towards the showers, Tom&rsquo;s mind numb. You don&rsquo;t hear him as he strips, pacing towards you but passing you and heading into the showers. When he clicks the water on, you sigh, eyes closing. Turning to look at him, he avoids your eyes, letting water drench his hair and pull it over his eyes, blood mixed with water swirling around the drain. After a few moments more, he hears you sigh and the clicks of your heels again as you walk away from him. He closes his eyes, not even fighting back the tears until your hands slide across his back and over his shoulders. You lay your cheek against the edge of his shoulder blade. He swallows,</p><p>&ldquo;I just&hellip; have lost enough women to that sorry son of a bitch and now here you are&hellip; after two years just fluttering your lashes and bending your knees all playful&hellip; not even for me&hellip; for him.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t help but feel bad. You&rsquo;d felt your cheeks flush, your heart stutter, while Harrison flirted ruthlessly before Tom. He&rsquo;d opened himself up to you after admitting he was scared of love and you were proving him right. You enjoyed the flirting from Harrison after having begged Tom to give you a chance and now you were hurting him. Running your hands along his biceps, veins still protruding from the skin, you curl them around his middle, holding his body back against yours,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Tom. You just- you know how I am. I wasn&rsquo;t looked at much when I was a teenager, into my twenties to now. It&rsquo;s nice to finally get some attention from such attractive men.&rdquo; Turning on you in a second, he  pins you to the cold tile wall behind you, a gasp slipping from your lips before he silences it with another passionate kiss that lasts longer than the others. He pulls back, dark eyes searching yours, </p><p>&ldquo;I can give you all the attention you want. You&rsquo;re mine and I can&rsquo;t give you up to him, to anyone.&rdquo; The pain in his eyes, the crack of his voice hurts you. When you reach up to stroke his cheek again, he blinks. Leaning in, you kiss him, holding his shoulders with your fingers in his hair. He pulls back, pressing his forehead to yours, waiting for you to speak. </p><p>&ldquo;You jealous little Brit.&rdquo; You say with a huff. He gives a small, broken smile,</p><p>&ldquo;You have no worry in the world Thomas. I&rsquo;m yours. I have been for two years and if no one has taken me from you yet, no one will. Not Harrison, not any other boxers, not any other man or woman. I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo; You reassure firmly. Holding his jaw in one hand, you clench your teeth. When you give a tug of his hair like he likes, his lips turn up in the smallest bit of pain before he nods, glancing down at your lips, leaning in again, lips against yours once more. He pulls you flush against him, holding you tight in his arms until you draw back again. Holding him, the two of you let water cascade over you, </p><p>&ldquo;So stop getting jealous.&rdquo; He chuckles,</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of the plan though isn&rsquo;t it? If I get jealous it makes you feel more wanted eh?&rdquo; You giggle, nodding after a moment, </p><p>&ldquo;Guess so, yeah.&rdquo; He nods, </p><p>&ldquo;So let me stew in jealously. Then we can bang later and it&rsquo;ll go away until the next time.&rdquo; You smile, kissing the corner of his mouth, </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He nods again, </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too. I swear.&rdquo; He purses his lips, </p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo; Watching you pick the tape from his knuckles, he swallows, wondering how he got so lucky to be here with you, to call you his. No matter what, no matter who flirts with you, it&rsquo;s all part of the game that he always wins. And you&rsquo;re the prize at the end.</p>",

He&rsquo;d opened himself up to you after admitting he was scared of love and you were proving him right. You enjoyed the flirting from Harrison after having begged Tom to give you a chance and now you were hurting him. Running your hands along his biceps, veins still protruding from the skin, you curl them around his middle, holding his body back against yours,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Tom. You just- you know how I am. I wasn&rsquo;t looked at much when I was a teenager, into my twenties to now. It&rsquo;s nice to finally get some attention from such attractive men.&rdquo; Turning on you in a second, he  pins you to the cold tile wall behind you, a gasp slipping from your lips before he silences it with another passionate kiss that lasts longer than the others. He pulls back, dark eyes searching yours, </p><p>&ldquo;I can give you all the attention you want. You&rsquo;re mine and I can&rsquo;t give you up to him, to anyone.&rdquo; The pain in his eyes, the crack of his voice hurts you. When you reach up to stroke his cheek again, he blinks. Leaning in, you kiss him, holding his shoulders with your fingers in his hair. He pulls back, pressing his forehead to yours, waiting for you to speak. </p><p>&ldquo;You jealous little Brit.&rdquo; You say with a huff. He gives a small, broken smile,</p><p>&ldquo;You have no worry in the world Thomas. I&rsquo;m yours. I have been for two years and if no one has taken me from you yet, no one will. Not Harrison, not any other boxers, not any other man or woman. I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo; You reassure firmly. Holding his jaw in one hand, you clench your teeth. When you give a tug of his hair like he likes, his lips turn up in the smallest bit of pain before he nods, glancing down at your lips, leaning in again, lips against yours once more. He pulls you flush against him, holding you tight in his arms until you draw back again. Holding him, the two of you let water cascade over you, </p><p>&ldquo;So stop getting jealous.&rdquo; He chuckles,</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of the plan though isn&rsquo;t it? If I get jealous it makes you feel more wanted eh?&rdquo; You giggle, nodding after a moment, </p><p>&ldquo;Guess so, yeah.&rdquo; He nods, </p><p>&ldquo;So let me stew in jealously. Then we can bang later and it&rsquo;ll go away until the next time.&rdquo; You smile, kissing the corner of his mouth, </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He nods again, </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too. I swear.&rdquo; He purses his lips, </p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo; Watching you pick the tape from his knuckles, he swallows, wondering how he got so lucky to be here with you, to call you his. No matter what, no matter who flirts with you, it&rsquo;s all part of the game that he always wins. And you&rsquo;re the prize at the end.</p>",

He knew that you liked him when he was Spider-Man, but that was because you didn\u2019t know he <i>was</i> Spider-Man. He hadn\u2019t come by your room since he left you at Stark Tower and that was three days ago. He didn\u2019t think he could tell Ned about his predicament and decided that he\u2019d sit in his thoughts before making a decision.</p><p>His main priority was to get his damned senses to calm down.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t they subsided? After all, he had found out a pretty big secret and to his knowledge, he was the only one who knew you were pretty upset about not having a father. Well, maybe MJ was an exception but that\u2019s because she\u2019s MJ.</p><p>Every time he was near you, he could feel his heart rate increase and his palms sweating. His breathing became hitched and all the hairs on the back of his neck stood up as if an evil villain had entered the premises. </p><p>But Peter knew that was ludicrous. In the back of his head, he accredited this feeling to having developed a <i>very</i> tiny crush on you. </p><!-- more --><p>After spending some time with you away from school where he didn\u2019t have to worry about something happening with hundreds of innocent people around, he got to know the real you and was pleasantly surprised. He knew you were allergic to avocados, preferred walking instead of driving, and hated horror films with a passion. Your apartment\u2019s balcony had been his save haven for when he felt like he couldn\u2019t talk to Ned about things that had been bothering him. In the process of getting to know you for the secret he had thought you were keeping, he had really gotten to know <i>you</i>.  </p><p>So his senses continuously going off the radar didn\u2019t make any sense to him. He could still feel his heart beat abnormally fast when you turned around the corner and dashed away in order for him to let his body have a chance to relax. It didn\u2019t help that you shared two classes with him and that\u2019s when he took a stabilizing pill Tony had given him in the beginning of their partnership for moments like these where his senses were hard to control. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he had heard you mumble after not having a second to process that someone had literally pushed him onto you. </p><p>Your books fell to the ground and his senses went haywire but Peter pushes those feelings down and bent down to help you pick up your books. </p><p>To say you were surprised wasn\u2019t off the record. Peter had never spared a second glance towards you and aside from the time you got Mexican food with him and Ned, you two had never spent any time alone without him bolting after thirty seconds. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you uttered, not knowing what else so say in this situation. </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Peter replied, feeling the same. You two stood up and to your surprise, Peter didn\u2019t walk away. \u201cSo, uh, got any plans for this weekend?\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrow quirked. \u201cNot much,\u201d you said, lying about your planned meetup with Spider-Man. \u201cJust hanging out with some friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, who?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know him,\u201d you said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t go here.\u201d Peter smiled to himself, kind of liking the idea of you taking a liking to him. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have fun,\u201d he said as you both exited the building for the end of the school day. \u201cI hope you and your mystery man have fun.\u201d You blushed at Peter teasing you and realized that this was the first time you and Peter had ever had a friendly conversation. Despite not having gotten to know him and vice versa, you felt a sense of deep familiarity and didn\u2019t know why. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d you said sheepishly. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d he said with a slight smirk. \u201cAnyway, see you Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d you said, trying not to wonder why he was being so casual with you. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll see you on Monday.\u201d </p><p>Peter bade you a goodbye and you watched at his figure disappeared, wondering if you could stop questioning the events of your life.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSo I just watched him leave,\u201d you told Spider-Man. You looked at his sitting figure and saw him tilt his head to the side as if he was thinking hard about what you said. \u201cI mean, we had never really spoken and then all of a sudden he wants to get food with me and asked if he\u2019ll see me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he just wants to become friends.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Spidey. One minute he\u2019s leaving every room I enter and the next, he\u2019s asking wants to know about my weekend plans. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cMaybe this Peter kid realized he was wrong to judge you before getting to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just strange,\u201d you say, stopping in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m really confused and I don\u2019t know how I feel because he\u2019s best friends with my best friends and we aren\u2019t friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him a chance,\u201d Spider-Man pleaded with a soft voice, almost breaking. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>As you stood in front of him, Spider-Man went to grip your arms and untangled them from one another as he pulled your body closer to his. You stood in between his legs and he looked up at you for a moment before pushing himself off of your bed.</p><p>\u201cI really like you,\u201d you whispered to fill the silence, not knowing why it felt like the right time to tell him. </p><p>\u201cI really like you too,\u201d Spider-Man replied before dipping his head to press his covered lips against your cheek. He let himself linger for a while and you closed your eyes to bask in the feeling of him. He was holding your upper arms and you bit your lip, feeling a bit disappointed when he pulled away.</p><p>He looked at you and pushed your hair back from your shoulders and gently cupped your jaw with both hands and rubbed your cheeks with his covered thumbs. Spider-Man was about to lean in when Karen interrupted him.</p><p><i>Tony Stark requests your presence</i>, she said. </p><p>He sighed and you chuckled, letting him know it was okay that he had to leave. After all, your balcony was always open for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, I promise,\u201d he said before kissing your cheek once more and disappearing from the window.</p><p>***</p><p>The second time you entered Stark Tower and march up to the receptionist\u2019s desk, you\u2019re pleasantly surprised that you were already in Tony\u2019s system and that you had a lanyard waiting for you. </p><p>The second meeting was a bit more formal on their part because they had Phil Coulson video chat with you, Natasha, and Tony, about The Index and further steps. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard good things about you,\u201d Phil said whole giving you a welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say the same,\u201d you replied.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best that you didn\u2019t know about me. I\u2019m sure you know all about alien encounters since Thor\u2019s appearance on Earth and it\u2019s my job to keep everyone else at bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any information, Coulson?\u201d Natasha asked.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, we have no close DNA matches that correlate to Y/N\u2019s DNA. We have a lot going on right now and a lot of personnel on The Index, but Fitz-Simmons have been running her DNA nonstop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you think we\u2019ll have a definitive answer?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cProbably not, if you want to keep comparing her DNA sample to new people we find. I\u2019ve gotta head out soon. Daisy\u2019s been itching to fly this plane ever since May taught her how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s a work in progress but we need another pilot. I\u2019ll call you if anything turns up.\u201d </p><p>The screen went blank and, quite frankly, you didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nice,\u201d you said to fill the void. \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, kiddo, I\u2019m not really sure,\u201d Tony said. He had compared your DNA to his and had made a discovery, but wasn\u2019t really sure how to go about processing it. </p><p>\u201cHave you had a tour of this tower yet?\u201d Natasha asked.</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cOnly the lobby and this floor.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWait right here, okay? I\u2019m going to get you one of the best tour guides and he\u2019ll show you around.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said, partially grateful for the gesture and partially confused by the sudden change of conversation. When Natasha left, you turned to Tony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finding my dad, am I?\u201d you asked. There wasn\u2019t much doubt in your voice, but lack of hope and confidence in the search. Even with Tony\u2019s connections and ability to use technology to track him down, it didn\u2019t seem like it was going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d said Tony. \u201cI bet he\u2019s out there looking for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said, defeated. \u201cI\u2019m scared to meet him, you know? He could turn out to be a drunk who\u2019s opinionated or some cold-hearted businessman who has no time for a wife and kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to love you,\u201d Tony said, speaking from the heart. \u201cHe\u2019s going to cherish you with everything he\u2019s got inside of him and he\u2019ll want to make up for all the lost time. He loves you even if you don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>You wiped a stray tear from your eye and Tony\u2019s heart softened, happy that his words had touched you in a way he never imagined.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you whispered. \u201cFor the words, advice, and the help. I\u2019ve never felt so hopeful in my entire life and I\u2019m just, I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019ve got some pretty great people on my side.\u201d</p><p>As Tony was about to speak, Natasha waltzed back into the room with Steve Rogers by her side.</p><p>\u201cY/N, meet Steve. Or Caption America, but Steve\u2019s just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d you swore. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Y/N.\u201d </p><p>Steve chuckled and shook your hand. \u201cNatasha\u2019s been pretty busy lately and I can see why. How about I show you around the tower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great!\u201d you exclaimed, forgetting about your conversation with Tony while in the presence of Steve. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in about an hour,\u201d Steve said before you waved goodbye to the two Avengers that you left behind.</p><p>\u201cI know you know,\u201d Natasha said once they were it of earshot. </p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me. I know you took one of the blood samples and compared it to your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhaaaat?\u201d Tony asked, dragging out the \u2018a.\u2019 \u201cWhy would I do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have a kid and you know she\u2019s out there,\u201d she replied. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with you for a long time now, Tony. I\u2019m a spy and I\u2019m perceptive. Plus, you left the digital file open when you asked me to run F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s diagnostics a few months ago and saw the header of the report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d Tony asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve found your reason to live,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cTo my understanding, you&rsquo;ve been searching for a long time. Not only for your child, but for a reason to live. She\u2019s it, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell her I\u2019m her father,\u201d he said in despair. \u201cIt\u2019ll make her feel more confused and I don\u2019t want her to live a life where she has to worry if I\u2019m coming home alive or not. I don\u2019t want her to deal with the press and paparazzi when she\u2019s trying to get to school, Natasha. I can\u2019t put her through that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her decision to make. Not telling Y/N you\u2019re her father is only going to leave her with unanswered questions for the rest of her life and she\u2019s going to be more upset with if you don\u2019t tell her you\u2019re her father. She\u2019s a smart girl and I can bet you almost anything she\u2019ll figure it out sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Tony put his head in his hands. \u201cAnd how do I explain why I wasn\u2019t there for her? She\u2019ll believe her mother over everything I say and I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to tell her why I wasn\u2019t able to find her sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, she\u2019s a smart girl. She\u2019ll probably need some time to process everything but I think you owe it to her to tell your side of the story. Let her know that you\u2019re with her, you know?\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYou\u2019re already important to her because you\u2019ve been helping her out so much and going the extra mile. She understands how special this makes her and being your daughter will make her feel even more special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited seventeen years for this moment and I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t think of anything to say to her,\u201d Tony begun. \u201cOh God, do I tell the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d Natasha replied. \u201cI love Peter to death but he\u2019s a blabbermouth and considering he\u2019s got a crush on Y/N, he\u2019ll want to tell her everything and it should come from you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cPeter doesn\u2019t like Y/N like that.\u201d</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know boys like I do. He has a thing for Y/N but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s made a move yet, considering she doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019ve missed Y/N\u2019s first boyfriend? Or girlfriend? I missed her first dance, tucking her in at night, and her first day of school. How do I make up for all of that?\u201d She sighed and patted his back. </p><p>\u201cLook, you just need to accept that you\u2019ve missed a lot of her firsts, but you can be there for her in the future. You can witness her graduate high school, go to college, get her first real job, and move out of the house. You\u2019re capable of much more than you think, Tony. You\u2019ve been preparing to be a father for seventeen years and all that preparation isn\u2019t going to let you down.\u201d</p><p>Despite their initial greeting, Tony couldn\u2019t be more happy that Natalie Rushman turned out to be Natasha Romanoff. While most knew her to be heartless and emotionless, Tony knew bee heart was in the right place and she could be the person who tells you what you need to hear when you need it. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Romanoff,\u201d he said. </p><p>A while later, you and Steve came back to the floor where you left from in a fit of laughter. </p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe the mouth on this kid,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s cracking jokes left and right. She kind of reminds me of you, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow funny,\u201d Tony replied with a proud smile. \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll make you one of my famous pastrami sandwiches before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d you said.</p><p>Tony waved you off. \u201cNah, it\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019ll tell you the secret ingredient to my aioli.\u201d</p><p>Natasha smiles as she watched you leave Steve\u2019s side and accompany Tony to the small kitchen on the floor. Steve walked to stand beside her and put his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really alike, aren\u2019t they? I can see why he likes having her around.\u201d Natasha rolled her eyes and smiled, patting his bicep with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d you asked when he put the two sandwich in the paper bag. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s quite simple, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is probably the one thing I\u2019ll be making for the next two week,\u201d you joked. \u201cIt tastes really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you like it. It\u2019s been real fun having you around, Y/N. I don\u2019t see a lot of fresh faces around here and your interest in the Avengers and engineering makes me hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for what?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged and grinned at you. \u201cNothing in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re peculiar, Tony. I like it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and patted on you on the shoulder as you were about to leave to the elevator, figuring a hug might be too awkward. </p><p>\u201cSee you soon, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Tony,\u201d you said before quickly giving him a hug and relishing the feeling of a father figure, you thought, being in your life even if it was only temporary. </p><p>Tony grinned at you and didn\u2019t stop when the elevator door closed. Natasha watched as Tony fist pumped the air and silently congratulated Tony on completing the one mission he had wanted to finish seventeen years ago. </p><p>***</p><p>taglist:</p><p><a

In the back of his head, he accredited this feeling to having developed a <i>very</i> tiny crush on you. </p>[[MORE]]<p>After spending some time with you away from school where he didn\u2019t have to worry about something happening with hundreds of innocent people around, he got to know the real you and was pleasantly surprised. He knew you were allergic to avocados, preferred walking instead of driving, and hated horror films with a passion. Your apartment\u2019s balcony had been his save haven for when he felt like he couldn\u2019t talk to Ned about things that had been bothering him. In the process of getting to know you for the secret he had thought you were keeping, he had really gotten to know <i>you</i>.  </p><p>So his senses continuously going off the radar didn\u2019t make any sense to him. He could still feel his heart beat abnormally fast when you turned around the corner and dashed away in order for him to let his body have a chance to relax. It didn\u2019t help that you shared two classes with him and that\u2019s when he took a stabilizing pill Tony had given him in the beginning of their partnership for moments like these where his senses were hard to control. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he had heard you mumble after not having a second to process that someone had literally pushed him onto you. </p><p>Your books fell to the ground and his senses went haywire but Peter pushes those feelings down and bent down to help you pick up your books. </p><p>To say you were surprised wasn\u2019t off the record. Peter had never spared a second glance towards you and aside from the time you got Mexican food with him and Ned, you two had never spent any time alone without him bolting after thirty seconds. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you uttered, not knowing what else so say in this situation. </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Peter replied, feeling the same. You two stood up and to your surprise, Peter didn\u2019t walk away. \u201cSo, uh, got any plans for this weekend?\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrow quirked. \u201cNot much,\u201d you said, lying about your planned meetup with Spider-Man. \u201cJust hanging out with some friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, who?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know him,\u201d you said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t go here.\u201d Peter smiled to himself, kind of liking the idea of you taking a liking to him. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have fun,\u201d he said as you both exited the building for the end of the school day. \u201cI hope you and your mystery man have fun.\u201d You blushed at Peter teasing you and realized that this was the first time you and Peter had ever had a friendly conversation. Despite not having gotten to know him and vice versa, you felt a sense of deep familiarity and didn\u2019t know why. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d you said sheepishly. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d he said with a slight smirk. \u201cAnyway, see you Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d you said, trying not to wonder why he was being so casual with you. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll see you on Monday.\u201d </p><p>Peter bade you a goodbye and you watched at his figure disappeared, wondering if you could stop questioning the events of your life.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSo I just watched him leave,\u201d you told Spider-Man. You looked at his sitting figure and saw him tilt his head to the side as if he was thinking hard about what you said. \u201cI mean, we had never really spoken and then all of a sudden he wants to get food with me and asked if he\u2019ll see me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he just wants to become friends.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Spidey. One minute he\u2019s leaving every room I enter and the next, he\u2019s asking wants to know about my weekend plans. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cMaybe this Peter kid realized he was wrong to judge you before getting to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just strange,\u201d you say, stopping in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m really confused and I don\u2019t know how I feel because he\u2019s best friends with my best friends and we aren\u2019t friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him a chance,\u201d Spider-Man pleaded with a soft voice, almost breaking. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>As you stood in front of him, Spider-Man went to grip your arms and untangled them from one another as he pulled your body closer to his. You stood in between his legs and he looked up at you for a moment before pushing himself off of your bed.</p><p>\u201cI really like you,\u201d you whispered to fill the silence, not knowing why it felt like the right time to tell him. </p><p>\u201cI really like you too,\u201d Spider-Man replied before dipping his head to press his covered lips against your cheek. He let himself linger for a while and you closed your eyes to bask in the feeling of him. He was holding your upper arms and you bit your lip, feeling a bit disappointed when he pulled away.</p><p>He looked at you and pushed your hair back from your shoulders and gently cupped your jaw with both hands and rubbed your cheeks with his covered thumbs. Spider-Man was about to lean in when Karen interrupted him.</p><p><i>Tony Stark requests your presence</i>, she said. </p><p>He sighed and you chuckled, letting him know it was okay that he had to leave. After all, your balcony was always open for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, I promise,\u201d he said before kissing your cheek once more and disappearing from the window.</p><p>***</p><p>The second time you entered Stark Tower and march up to the receptionist\u2019s desk, you\u2019re pleasantly surprised that you were already in Tony\u2019s system and that you had a lanyard waiting for you. </p><p>The second meeting was a bit more formal on their part because they had Phil Coulson video chat with you, Natasha, and Tony, about The Index and further steps. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard good things about you,\u201d Phil said whole giving you a welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say the same,\u201d you replied.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best that you didn\u2019t know about me. I\u2019m sure you know all about alien encounters since Thor\u2019s appearance on Earth and it\u2019s my job to keep everyone else at bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any information, Coulson?\u201d Natasha asked.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, we have no close DNA matches that correlate to Y/N\u2019s DNA. We have a lot going on right now and a lot of personnel on The Index, but Fitz-Simmons have been running her DNA nonstop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you think we\u2019ll have a definitive answer?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cProbably not, if you want to keep comparing her DNA sample to new people we find. I\u2019ve gotta head out soon. Daisy\u2019s been itching to fly this plane ever since May taught her how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s a work in progress but we need another pilot. I\u2019ll call you if anything turns up.\u201d </p><p>The screen went blank and, quite frankly, you didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nice,\u201d you said to fill the void. \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, kiddo, I\u2019m not really sure,\u201d Tony said. He had compared your DNA to his and had made a discovery, but wasn\u2019t really sure how to go about processing it. </p><p>\u201cHave you had a tour of this tower yet?\u201d Natasha asked.</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cOnly the lobby and this floor.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWait right here, okay? I\u2019m going to get you one of the best tour guides and he\u2019ll show you around.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said, partially grateful for the gesture and partially confused by the sudden change of conversation. When Natasha left, you turned to Tony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finding my dad, am I?\u201d you asked. There wasn\u2019t much doubt in your voice, but lack of hope and confidence in the search. Even with Tony\u2019s connections and ability to use technology to track him down, it didn\u2019t seem like it was going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d said Tony. \u201cI bet he\u2019s out there looking for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said, defeated. \u201cI\u2019m scared to meet him, you know? He could turn out to be a drunk who\u2019s opinionated or some cold-hearted businessman who has no time for a wife and kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to love you,\u201d Tony said, speaking from the heart. \u201cHe\u2019s going to cherish you with everything he\u2019s got inside of him and he\u2019ll want to make up for all the lost time. He loves you even if you don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>You wiped a stray tear from your eye and Tony\u2019s heart softened, happy that his words had touched you in a way he never imagined.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you whispered. \u201cFor the words, advice, and the help. I\u2019ve never felt so hopeful in my entire life and I\u2019m just, I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019ve got some pretty great people on my side.\u201d</p><p>As Tony was about to speak, Natasha waltzed back into the room with Steve Rogers by her side.</p><p>\u201cY/N, meet Steve. Or Caption America, but Steve\u2019s just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d you swore. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Y/N.\u201d </p><p>Steve chuckled and shook your hand. \u201cNatasha\u2019s been pretty busy lately and I can see why. How about I show you around the tower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great!\u201d you exclaimed, forgetting about your conversation with Tony while in the presence of Steve. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in about an hour,\u201d Steve said before you waved goodbye to the two Avengers that you left behind.</p><p>\u201cI know you know,\u201d Natasha said once they were it of earshot. </p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me. I know you took one of the blood samples and compared it to your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhaaaat?\u201d Tony asked, dragging out the \u2018a.\u2019 \u201cWhy would I do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have a kid and you know she\u2019s out there,\u201d she replied. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with you for a long time now, Tony. I\u2019m a spy and I\u2019m perceptive. Plus, you left the digital file open when you asked me to run F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s diagnostics a few months ago and saw the header of the report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d Tony asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve found your reason to live,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cTo my understanding, you\u2019ve been searching for a long time. Not only for your child, but for a reason to live. She\u2019s it, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell her I\u2019m her father,\u201d he said in despair. \u201cIt\u2019ll make her feel more confused and I don\u2019t want her to live a life where she has to worry if I\u2019m coming home alive or not. I don\u2019t want her to deal with the press and paparazzi when she\u2019s trying to get to school, Natasha. I can\u2019t put her through that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her decision to make. Not telling Y/N you\u2019re her father is only going to leave her with unanswered questions for the rest of her life and she\u2019s going to be more upset with if you don\u2019t tell her you\u2019re her father. She\u2019s a smart girl and I can bet you almost anything she\u2019ll figure it out sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Tony put his head in his hands. \u201cAnd how do I explain why I wasn\u2019t there for her? She\u2019ll believe her mother over everything I say and I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to tell her why I wasn\u2019t able to find her sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, she\u2019s a smart girl. She\u2019ll probably need some time to process everything but I think you owe it to her to tell your side of the story. Let her know that you\u2019re with her, you know?\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYou\u2019re already important to her because you\u2019ve been helping her out so much and going the extra mile. She understands how special this makes her and being your daughter will make her feel even more special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited seventeen years for this moment and I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t think of anything to say to her,\u201d Tony begun. \u201cOh God, do I tell the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d Natasha replied. \u201cI love Peter to death but he\u2019s a blabbermouth and considering he\u2019s got a crush on Y/N, he\u2019ll want to tell her everything and it should come from you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cPeter doesn\u2019t like Y/N like that.\u201d</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know boys like I do. He has a thing for Y/N but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s made a move yet, considering she doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019ve missed Y/N\u2019s first boyfriend? Or girlfriend? I missed her first dance, tucking her in at night, and her first day of school. How do I make up for all of that?\u201d She sighed and patted his back. </p><p>\u201cLook, you just need to accept that you\u2019ve missed a lot of her firsts, but you can be there for her in the future. You can witness her graduate high school, go to college, get her first real job, and move out of the house. You\u2019re capable of much more than you think, Tony. You\u2019ve been preparing to be a father for seventeen years and all that preparation isn\u2019t going to let you down.\u201d</p><p>Despite their initial greeting, Tony couldn\u2019t be more happy that Natalie Rushman turned out to be Natasha Romanoff. While most knew her to be heartless and emotionless, Tony knew bee heart was in the right place and she could be the person who tells you what you need to hear when you need it. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Romanoff,\u201d he said. </p><p>A while later, you and Steve came back to the floor where you left from in a fit of laughter. </p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe the mouth on this kid,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s cracking jokes left and right. She kind of reminds me of you, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow funny,\u201d Tony replied with a proud smile. \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll make you one of my famous pastrami sandwiches before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d you said.</p><p>Tony waved you off. \u201cNah, it\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019ll tell you the secret ingredient to my aioli.\u201d</p><p>Natasha smiles as she watched you leave Steve\u2019s side and accompany Tony to the small kitchen on the floor. Steve walked to stand beside her and put his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really alike, aren\u2019t they? I can see why he likes having her around.\u201d Natasha rolled her eyes and smiled, patting his bicep with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d you asked when he put the two sandwich in the paper bag. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s quite simple, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is probably the one thing I\u2019ll be making for the next two week,\u201d you joked. \u201cIt tastes really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you like it. It\u2019s been real fun having you around, Y/N. I don\u2019t see a lot of fresh faces around here and your interest in the Avengers and engineering makes me hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for what?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged and grinned at you. \u201cNothing in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re peculiar, Tony. I like it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and patted on you on the shoulder as you were about to leave to the elevator, figuring a hug might be too awkward. </p><p>\u201cSee you soon, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Tony,\u201d you said before quickly giving him a hug and relishing the feeling of a father figure, you thought, being in your life even if it was only temporary. </p><p>Tony grinned at you and didn\u2019t stop when the elevator door closed. Natasha watched as Tony fist pumped the air and silently congratulated Tony on completing the one mission he had wanted to finish seventeen years ago. </p><p>***</p><p>taglist:</p><p><a

He knew that you liked him when he was Spider-Man, but that was because you didn\u2019t know he <i>was</i> Spider-Man. He hadn\u2019t come by your room since he left you at Stark Tower and that was three days ago. He didn\u2019t think he could tell Ned about his predicament and decided that he\u2019d sit in his thoughts before making a decision.</p><p>His main priority was to get his damned senses to calm down.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t they subsided? After all, he had found out a pretty big secret and to his knowledge, he was the only one who knew you were pretty upset about not having a father. Well, maybe MJ was an exception but that\u2019s because she\u2019s MJ.</p><p>Every time he was near you, he could feel his heart rate increase and his palms sweating. His breathing became hitched and all the hairs on the back of his neck stood up as if an evil villain had entered the premises. </p><p>But Peter knew that was ludicrous. In the back of his head, he accredited this feeling to having developed a <i>very</i> tiny crush on you. </p>[[MORE]]<p>After spending some time with you away from school where he didn\u2019t have to worry about something happening with hundreds of innocent people around, he got to know the real you and was pleasantly surprised. He knew you were allergic to avocados, preferred walking instead of driving, and hated horror films with a passion. Your apartment\u2019s balcony had been his save haven for when he felt like he couldn\u2019t talk to Ned about things that had been bothering him. In the process of getting to know you for the secret he had thought you were keeping, he had really gotten to know <i>you</i>.  </p><p>So his senses continuously going off the radar didn\u2019t make any sense to him. He could still feel his heart beat abnormally fast when you turned around the corner and dashed away in order for him to let his body have a chance to relax. It didn\u2019t help that you shared two classes with him and that\u2019s when he took a stabilizing pill Tony had given him in the beginning of their partnership for moments like these where his senses were hard to control. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he had heard you mumble after not having a second to process that someone had literally pushed him onto you. </p><p>Your books fell to the ground and his senses went haywire but Peter pushes those feelings down and bent down to help you pick up your books. </p><p>To say you were surprised wasn\u2019t off the record. Peter had never spared a second glance towards you and aside from the time you got Mexican food with him and Ned, you two had never spent any time alone without him bolting after thirty seconds. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you uttered, not knowing what else so say in this situation. </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Peter replied, feeling the same. You two stood up and to your surprise, Peter didn\u2019t walk away. \u201cSo, uh, got any plans for this weekend?\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrow quirked. \u201cNot much,\u201d you said, lying about your planned meetup with Spider-Man. \u201cJust hanging out with some friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, who?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know him,\u201d you said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t go here.\u201d Peter smiled to himself, kind of liking the idea of you taking a liking to him. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have fun,\u201d he said as you both exited the building for the end of the school day. \u201cI hope you and your mystery man have fun.\u201d You blushed at Peter teasing you and realized that this was the first time you and Peter had ever had a friendly conversation. Despite not having gotten to know him and vice versa, you felt a sense of deep familiarity and didn\u2019t know why. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d you said sheepishly. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d he said with a slight smirk. \u201cAnyway, see you Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d you said, trying not to wonder why he was being so casual with you. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll see you on Monday.\u201d </p><p>Peter bade you a goodbye and you watched at his figure disappeared, wondering if you could stop questioning the events of your life.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSo I just watched him leave,\u201d you told Spider-Man. You looked at his sitting figure and saw him tilt his head to the side as if he was thinking hard about what you said. \u201cI mean, we had never really spoken and then all of a sudden he wants to get food with me and asked if he\u2019ll see me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he just wants to become friends.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Spidey. One minute he\u2019s leaving every room I enter and the next, he\u2019s asking wants to know about my weekend plans. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cMaybe this Peter kid realized he was wrong to judge you before getting to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just strange,\u201d you say, stopping in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m really confused and I don\u2019t know how I feel because he\u2019s best friends with my best friends and we aren\u2019t friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him a chance,\u201d Spider-Man pleaded with a soft voice, almost breaking. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>As you stood in front of him, Spider-Man went to grip your arms and untangled them from one another as he pulled your body closer to his. You stood in between his legs and he looked up at you for a moment before pushing himself off of your bed.</p><p>\u201cI really like you,\u201d you whispered to fill the silence, not knowing why it felt like the right time to tell him. </p><p>\u201cI really like you too,\u201d Spider-Man replied before dipping his head to press his covered lips against your cheek. He let himself linger for a while and you closed your eyes to bask in the feeling of him. He was holding your upper arms and you bit your lip, feeling a bit disappointed when he pulled away.</p><p>He looked at you and pushed your hair back from your shoulders and gently cupped your jaw with both hands and rubbed your cheeks with his covered thumbs. Spider-Man was about to lean in when Karen interrupted him.</p><p><i>Tony Stark requests your presence</i>, she said. </p><p>He sighed and you chuckled, letting him know it was okay that he had to leave. After all, your balcony was always open for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, I promise,\u201d he said before kissing your cheek once more and disappearing from the window.</p><p>***</p><p>The second time you entered Stark Tower and march up to the receptionist\u2019s desk, you\u2019re pleasantly surprised that you were already in Tony\u2019s system and that you had a lanyard waiting for you. </p><p>The second meeting was a bit more formal on their part because they had Phil Coulson video chat with you, Natasha, and Tony, about The Index and further steps. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard good things about you,\u201d Phil said whole giving you a welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say the same,\u201d you replied.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best that you didn\u2019t know about me. I\u2019m sure you know all about alien encounters since Thor\u2019s appearance on Earth and it\u2019s my job to keep everyone else at bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any information, Coulson?\u201d Natasha asked.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, we have no close DNA matches that correlate to Y/N\u2019s DNA. We have a lot going on right now and a lot of personnel on The Index, but Fitz-Simmons have been running her DNA nonstop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you think we\u2019ll have a definitive answer?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cProbably not, if you want to keep comparing her DNA sample to new people we find. I\u2019ve gotta head out soon. Daisy\u2019s been itching to fly this plane ever since May taught her how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s a work in progress but we need another pilot. I\u2019ll call you if anything turns up.\u201d </p><p>The screen went blank and, quite frankly, you didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nice,\u201d you said to fill the void. \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, kiddo, I\u2019m not really sure,\u201d Tony said. He had compared your DNA to his and had made a discovery, but wasn\u2019t really sure how to go about processing it. </p><p>\u201cHave you had a tour of this tower yet?\u201d Natasha asked.</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cOnly the lobby and this floor.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWait right here, okay? I\u2019m going to get you one of the best tour guides and he\u2019ll show you around.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said, partially grateful for the gesture and partially confused by the sudden change of conversation. When Natasha left, you turned to Tony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finding my dad, am I?\u201d you asked. There wasn\u2019t much doubt in your voice, but lack of hope and confidence in the search. Even with Tony\u2019s connections and ability to use technology to track him down, it didn\u2019t seem like it was going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d said Tony. \u201cI bet he\u2019s out there looking for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said, defeated. \u201cI\u2019m scared to meet him, you know? He could turn out to be a drunk who\u2019s opinionated or some cold-hearted businessman who has no time for a wife and kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to love you,\u201d Tony said, speaking from the heart. \u201cHe\u2019s going to cherish you with everything he\u2019s got inside of him and he\u2019ll want to make up for all the lost time. He loves you even if you don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>You wiped a stray tear from your eye and Tony\u2019s heart softened, happy that his words had touched you in a way he never imagined.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you whispered. \u201cFor the words, advice, and the help. I\u2019ve never felt so hopeful in my entire life and I\u2019m just, I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019ve got some pretty great people on my side.\u201d</p><p>As Tony was about to speak, Natasha waltzed back into the room with Steve Rogers by her side.</p><p>\u201cY/N, meet Steve. Or Caption America, but Steve\u2019s just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d you swore. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Y/N.\u201d </p><p>Steve chuckled and shook your hand. \u201cNatasha\u2019s been pretty busy lately and I can see why. How about I show you around the tower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great!\u201d you exclaimed, forgetting about your conversation with Tony while in the presence of Steve. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in about an hour,\u201d Steve said before you waved goodbye to the two Avengers that you left behind.</p><p>\u201cI know you know,\u201d Natasha said once they were it of earshot. </p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me. I know you took one of the blood samples and compared it to your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhaaaat?\u201d Tony asked, dragging out the \u2018a.\u2019 \u201cWhy would I do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have a kid and you know she\u2019s out there,\u201d she replied. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with you for a long time now, Tony. I\u2019m a spy and I\u2019m perceptive. Plus, you left the digital file open when you asked me to run F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s diagnostics a few months ago and saw the header of the report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d Tony asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve found your reason to live,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cTo my understanding, you\u2019ve been searching for a long time. Not only for your child, but for a reason to live. She\u2019s it, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell her I\u2019m her father,\u201d he said in despair. \u201cIt\u2019ll make her feel more confused and I don\u2019t want her to live a life where she has to worry if I\u2019m coming home alive or not. I don\u2019t want her to deal with the press and paparazzi when she\u2019s trying to get to school, Natasha. I can\u2019t put her through that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her decision to make. Not telling Y/N you\u2019re her father is only going to leave her with unanswered questions for the rest of her life and she\u2019s going to be more upset with if you don\u2019t tell her you\u2019re her father. She\u2019s a smart girl and I can bet you almost anything she\u2019ll figure it out sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Tony put his head in his hands. \u201cAnd how do I explain why I wasn\u2019t there for her? She\u2019ll believe her mother over everything I say and I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to tell her why I wasn\u2019t able to find her sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, she\u2019s a smart girl. She\u2019ll probably need some time to process everything but I think you owe it to her to tell your side of the story. Let her know that you\u2019re with her, you know?\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYou\u2019re already important to her because you\u2019ve been helping her out so much and going the extra mile. She understands how special this makes her and being your daughter will make her feel even more special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited seventeen years for this moment and I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t think of anything to say to her,\u201d Tony begun. \u201cOh God, do I tell the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d Natasha replied. \u201cI love Peter to death but he\u2019s a blabbermouth and considering he\u2019s got a crush on Y/N, he\u2019ll want to tell her everything and it should come from you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cPeter doesn\u2019t like Y/N like that.\u201d</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know boys like I do. He has a thing for Y/N but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s made a move yet, considering she doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019ve missed Y/N\u2019s first boyfriend? Or girlfriend? I missed her first dance, tucking her in at night, and her first day of school. How do I make up for all of that?\u201d She sighed and patted his back. </p><p>\u201cLook, you just need to accept that you\u2019ve missed a lot of her firsts, but you can be there for her in the future. You can witness her graduate high school, go to college, get her first real job, and move out of the house. You\u2019re capable of much more than you think, Tony. You\u2019ve been preparing to be a father for seventeen years and all that preparation isn\u2019t going to let you down.\u201d</p><p>Despite their initial greeting, Tony couldn\u2019t be more happy that Natalie Rushman turned out to be Natasha Romanoff. While most knew her to be heartless and emotionless, Tony knew bee heart was in the right place and she could be the person who tells you what you need to hear when you need it. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Romanoff,\u201d he said. </p><p>A while later, you and Steve came back to the floor where you left from in a fit of laughter. </p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe the mouth on this kid,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s cracking jokes left and right. She kind of reminds me of you, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow funny,\u201d Tony replied with a proud smile. \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll make you one of my famous pastrami sandwiches before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d you said.</p><p>Tony waved you off. \u201cNah, it\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019ll tell you the secret ingredient to my aioli.\u201d</p><p>Natasha smiles as she watched you leave Steve\u2019s side and accompany Tony to the small kitchen on the floor. Steve walked to stand beside her and put his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really alike, aren\u2019t they? I can see why he likes having her around.\u201d Natasha rolled her eyes and smiled, patting his bicep with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d you asked when he put the two sandwich in the paper bag. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s quite simple, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is probably the one thing I\u2019ll be making for the next two week,\u201d you joked. \u201cIt tastes really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you like it. It\u2019s been real fun having you around, Y/N. I don\u2019t see a lot of fresh faces around here and your interest in the Avengers and engineering makes me hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for what?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged and grinned at you. \u201cNothing in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re peculiar, Tony. I like it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and patted on you on the shoulder as you were about to leave to the elevator, figuring a hug might be too awkward. </p><p>\u201cSee you soon, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Tony,\u201d you said before quickly giving him a hug and relishing the feeling of a father figure, you thought, being in your life even if it was only temporary. </p><p>Tony grinned at you and didn\u2019t stop when the elevator door closed. Natasha watched as Tony fist pumped the air and silently congratulated Tony on completing the one mission he had wanted to finish seventeen years ago. </p><p>***</p><p>taglist:</p><p><a

He knew that you liked him when he was Spider-Man, but that was because you didn&rsquo;t know he <i>was</i> Spider-Man. He hadn&rsquo;t come by your room since he left you at Stark Tower and that was three days ago. He didn&rsquo;t think he could tell Ned about his predicament and decided that he&rsquo;d sit in his thoughts before making a decision.</p><p>His main priority was to get his damned senses to calm down.</p><p>Why hadn&rsquo;t they subsided? After all, he had found out a pretty big secret and to his knowledge, he was the only one who knew you were pretty upset about not having a father. Well, maybe MJ was an exception but that&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s MJ.</p><p>Every time he was near you, he could feel his heart rate increase and his palms sweating. His breathing became hitched and all the hairs on the back of his neck stood up as if an evil villain had entered the premises. </p><p>But Peter knew that was ludicrous. In the back of his head, he accredited this feeling to having developed a <i>very</i> tiny crush on you. </p><p>After spending some time with you away from school where he didn&rsquo;t have to worry about something happening with hundreds of innocent people around, he got to know the real you and was pleasantly surprised. He knew you were allergic to avocados, preferred walking instead of driving, and hated horror films with a passion. Your apartment&rsquo;s balcony had been his save haven for when he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t talk to Ned about things that had been bothering him. In the process of getting to know you for the secret he had thought you were keeping, he had really gotten to know <i>you</i>.  </p><p>So his senses continuously going off the radar didn&rsquo;t make any sense to him. He could still feel his heart beat abnormally fast when you turned around the corner and dashed away in order for him to let his body have a chance to relax. It didn&rsquo;t help that you shared two classes with him and that&rsquo;s when he took a stabilizing pill Tony had given him in the beginning of their partnership for moments like these where his senses were hard to control. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he had heard you mumble after not having a second to process that someone had literally pushed him onto you. </p><p>Your books fell to the ground and his senses went haywire but Peter pushes those feelings down and bent down to help you pick up your books. </p><p>To say you were surprised wasn&rsquo;t off the record. Peter had never spared a second glance towards you and aside from the time you got Mexican food with him and Ned, you two had never spent any time alone without him bolting after thirty seconds. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you uttered, not knowing what else so say in this situation. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Peter replied, feeling the same. You two stood up and to your surprise, Peter didn&rsquo;t walk away. &ldquo;So, uh, got any plans for this weekend?&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyebrow quirked. &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; you said, lying about your planned meetup with Spider-Man. &ldquo;Just hanging out with some friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, who?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t go here.&rdquo; Peter smiled to himself, kind of liking the idea of you taking a liking to him. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have fun,&rdquo; he said as you both exited the building for the end of the school day. &ldquo;I hope you and your mystery man have fun.&rdquo; You blushed at Peter teasing you and realized that this was the first time you and Peter had ever had a friendly conversation. Despite not having gotten to know him and vice versa, you felt a sense of deep familiarity and didn&rsquo;t know why. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that,&rdquo; you said sheepishly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; he said with a slight smirk. &ldquo;Anyway, see you Monday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; you said, trying not to wonder why he was being so casual with you. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll see you on Monday.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter bade you a goodbye and you watched at his figure disappeared, wondering if you could stop questioning the events of your life.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;So I just watched him leave,&rdquo; you told Spider-Man. You looked at his sitting figure and saw him tilt his head to the side as if he was thinking hard about what you said. &ldquo;I mean, we had never really spoken and then all of a sudden he wants to get food with me and asked if he&rsquo;ll see me around.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Weird,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe he just wants to become friends.&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Spidey. One minute he&rsquo;s leaving every room I enter and the next, he&rsquo;s asking wants to know about my weekend plans. Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s weird?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;Maybe this Peter kid realized he was wrong to judge you before getting to know you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just strange,&rdquo; you say, stopping in front of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really confused and I don&rsquo;t know how I feel because he&rsquo;s best friends with my best friends and we aren&rsquo;t friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give him a chance,&rdquo; Spider-Man pleaded with a soft voice, almost breaking. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>As you stood in front of him, Spider-Man went to grip your arms and untangled them from one another as he pulled your body closer to his. You stood in between his legs and he looked up at you for a moment before pushing himself off of your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;I really like you,&rdquo; you whispered to fill the silence, not knowing why it felt like the right time to tell him. </p><p>&ldquo;I really like you too,&rdquo; Spider-Man replied before dipping his head to press his covered lips against your cheek. He let himself linger for a while and you closed your eyes to bask in the feeling of him. He was holding your upper arms and you bit your lip, feeling a bit disappointed when he pulled away.</p><p>He looked at you and pushed your hair back from your shoulders and gently cupped your jaw with both hands and rubbed your cheeks with his covered thumbs. Spider-Man was about to lean in when Karen interrupted him.</p><p><i>Tony Stark requests your presence</i>, she said. </p><p>He sighed and you chuckled, letting him know it was okay that he had to leave. After all, your balcony was always open for him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back soon, I promise,&rdquo; he said before kissing your cheek once more and disappearing from the window.</p><p>***</p><p>The second time you entered Stark Tower and march up to the receptionist&rsquo;s desk, you&rsquo;re pleasantly surprised that you were already in Tony&rsquo;s system and that you had a lanyard waiting for you. </p><p>The second meeting was a bit more formal on their part because they had Phil Coulson video chat with you, Natasha, and Tony, about The Index and further steps. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard good things about you,&rdquo; Phil said whole giving you a welcoming smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I could say the same,&rdquo; you replied.</p><p>He chuckled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably for the best that you didn&rsquo;t know about me. I&rsquo;m sure you know all about alien encounters since Thor&rsquo;s appearance on Earth and it&rsquo;s my job to keep everyone else at bay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have any information, Coulson?&rdquo; Natasha asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So far, we have no close DNA matches that correlate to Y/N&rsquo;s DNA. We have a lot going on right now and a lot of personnel on The Index, but Fitz-Simmons have been running her DNA nonstop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And do you think we&rsquo;ll have a definitive answer?&rdquo; Tony asked.</p><p>Phil shook his head. &ldquo;Probably not, if you want to keep comparing her DNA sample to new people we find. I&rsquo;ve gotta head out soon. Daisy&rsquo;s been itching to fly this plane ever since May taught her how.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckled. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a work in progress but we need another pilot. I&rsquo;ll call you if anything turns up.&rdquo; </p><p>The screen went blank and, quite frankly, you didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; you said to fill the void. &ldquo;So, uh, what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, kiddo, I&rsquo;m not really sure,&rdquo; Tony said. He had compared your DNA to his and had made a discovery, but wasn&rsquo;t really sure how to go about processing it. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you had a tour of this tower yet?&rdquo; Natasha asked.</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;Only the lobby and this floor.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled. &ldquo;Wait right here, okay? I&rsquo;m going to get you one of the best tour guides and he&rsquo;ll show you around.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you said, partially grateful for the gesture and partially confused by the sudden change of conversation. When Natasha left, you turned to Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not finding my dad, am I?&rdquo; you asked. There wasn&rsquo;t much doubt in your voice, but lack of hope and confidence in the search. Even with Tony&rsquo;s connections and ability to use technology to track him down, it didn&rsquo;t seem like it was going anywhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said Tony. &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;s out there looking for you right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; you said, defeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared to meet him, you know? He could turn out to be a drunk who&rsquo;s opinionated or some cold-hearted businessman who has no time for a wife and kids.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to love you,&rdquo; Tony said, speaking from the heart. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to cherish you with everything he&rsquo;s got inside of him and he&rsquo;ll want to make up for all the lost time. He loves you even if you don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p><p>You wiped a stray tear from your eye and Tony&rsquo;s heart softened, happy that his words had touched you in a way he never imagined.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;For the words, advice, and the help. I&rsquo;ve never felt so hopeful in my entire life and I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m really happy that I&rsquo;ve got some pretty great people on my side.&rdquo;</p><p>As Tony was about to speak, Natasha waltzed back into the room with Steve Rogers by her side.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, meet Steve. Or Caption America, but Steve&rsquo;s just fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo; you swore. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve chuckled and shook your hand. &ldquo;Natasha&rsquo;s been pretty busy lately and I can see why. How about I show you around the tower?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds great!&rdquo; you exclaimed, forgetting about your conversation with Tony while in the presence of Steve. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back in about an hour,&rdquo; Steve said before you waved goodbye to the two Avengers that you left behind.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you know,&rdquo; Natasha said once they were it of earshot. </p><p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; Tony replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play coy with me. I know you took one of the blood samples and compared it to your own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whaaaat?&rdquo; Tony asked, dragging out the &lsquo;a.&rsquo; &ldquo;Why would I do such a thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you have a kid and you know she&rsquo;s out there,&rdquo; she replied. </p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked with you for a long time now, Tony. I&rsquo;m a spy and I&rsquo;m perceptive. Plus, you left the digital file open when you asked me to run F.R.I.D.A.Y&rsquo;s diagnostics a few months ago and saw the header of the report.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what do you think?&rdquo; Tony asked anxiously.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve found your reason to live,&rdquo; she said honestly. &ldquo;To my understanding, you&rsquo;ve been searching for a long time. Not only for your child, but for a reason to live. She&rsquo;s it, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell her I&rsquo;m her father,&rdquo; he said in despair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll make her feel more confused and I don&rsquo;t want her to live a life where she has to worry if I&rsquo;m coming home alive or not. I don&rsquo;t want her to deal with the press and paparazzi when she&rsquo;s trying to get to school, Natasha. I can&rsquo;t put her through that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her decision to make. Not telling Y/N you&rsquo;re her father is only going to leave her with unanswered questions for the rest of her life and she&rsquo;s going to be more upset with if you don&rsquo;t tell her you&rsquo;re her father. She&rsquo;s a smart girl and I can bet you almost anything she&rsquo;ll figure it out sooner or later.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony put his head in his hands. &ldquo;And how do I explain why I wasn&rsquo;t there for her? She&rsquo;ll believe her mother over everything I say and I&rsquo;m afraid that I won&rsquo;t be able to tell her why I wasn&rsquo;t able to find her sooner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like I said, she&rsquo;s a smart girl. She&rsquo;ll probably need some time to process everything but I think you owe it to her to tell your side of the story. Let her know that you&rsquo;re with her, you know?&rdquo; Natasha said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re already important to her because you&rsquo;ve been helping her out so much and going the extra mile. She understands how special this makes her and being your daughter will make her feel even more special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited seventeen years for this moment and I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I can&rsquo;t think of anything to say to her,&rdquo; Tony begun. &ldquo;Oh God, do I tell the kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; Natasha replied. &ldquo;I love Peter to death but he&rsquo;s a blabbermouth and considering he&rsquo;s got a crush on Y/N, he&rsquo;ll want to tell her everything and it should come from you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s head snapped up. &ldquo;Peter doesn&rsquo;t like Y/N like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know boys like I do. He has a thing for Y/N but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s made a move yet, considering she doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s Peter Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if I&rsquo;ve missed Y/N&rsquo;s first boyfriend? Or girlfriend? I missed her first dance, tucking her in at night, and her first day of school. How do I make up for all of that?&rdquo; She sighed and patted his back. </p><p>&ldquo;Look, you just need to accept that you&rsquo;ve missed a lot of her firsts, but you can be there for her in the future. You can witness her graduate high school, go to college, get her first real job, and move out of the house. You&rsquo;re capable of much more than you think, Tony. You&rsquo;ve been preparing to be a father for seventeen years and all that preparation isn&rsquo;t going to let you down.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite their initial greeting, Tony couldn&rsquo;t be more happy that Natalie Rushman turned out to be Natasha Romanoff. While most knew her to be heartless and emotionless, Tony knew bee heart was in the right place and she could be the person who tells you what you need to hear when you need it. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Romanoff,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>A while later, you and Steve came back to the floor where you left from in a fit of laughter. </p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe the mouth on this kid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s cracking jokes left and right. She kind of reminds me of you, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How funny,&rdquo; Tony replied with a proud smile. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, I&rsquo;ll make you one of my famous pastrami sandwiches before you leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my, you don&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>Tony waved you off. &ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s no big deal. I&rsquo;ll tell you the secret ingredient to my aioli.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha smiles as she watched you leave Steve&rsquo;s side and accompany Tony to the small kitchen on the floor. Steve walked to stand beside her and put his hands on his hips.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re really alike, aren&rsquo;t they? I can see why he likes having her around.&rdquo; Natasha rolled her eyes and smiled, patting his bicep with a knowing smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Rogers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; you asked when he put the two sandwich in the paper bag. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s quite simple, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is probably the one thing I&rsquo;ll be making for the next two week,&rdquo; you joked. &ldquo;It tastes really good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m glad you like it. It&rsquo;s been real fun having you around, Y/N. I don&rsquo;t see a lot of fresh faces around here and your interest in the Avengers and engineering makes me hopeful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, for what?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shrugged and grinned at you. &ldquo;Nothing in particular.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re peculiar, Tony.

He knew that you liked him when he was Spider-Man, but that was because you didn&rsquo;t know he <i>was</i> Spider-Man. He hadn&rsquo;t come by your room since he left you at Stark Tower and that was three days ago. He didn&rsquo;t think he could tell Ned about his predicament and decided that he&rsquo;d sit in his thoughts before making a decision.</p>\n<p>His main priority was to get his damned senses to calm down.</p>\n<p>Why hadn&rsquo;t they subsided? After all, he had found out a pretty big secret and to his knowledge, he was the only one who knew you were pretty upset about not having a father. Well, maybe MJ was an exception but that&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s MJ.</p>\n<p>Every time he was near you, he could feel his heart rate increase and his palms sweating. His breathing became hitched and all the hairs on the back of his neck stood up as if an evil villain had entered the premises. </p>\n<p>But Peter knew that was ludicrous. In the back of his head, he accredited this feeling to having developed a <i>very</i> tiny crush on you. </p>\n</p>",
