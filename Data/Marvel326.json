Red roses with Madonna lilies. Damn, it was beautiful. You felt your cheeks turn red until you heard a door open behind you. Across the street stood your competitor, leaning against his door. You nodded and said to yourself. \u201cNice one, Barnes.\u201d This was just the beginning to your own cheesy love story.</p><p>You were one of the best florists in the city. You sold all kinds of flowers. Roses, daisies, sunflowers, name it. You also sold them at an affordable price. You had lived above the flower shop. People who lived nearby had known you as long as you lived there. You had seen the usual flower truck that dropped off your flowers across the street. You noticed a new face taking the flowers out of the back of the truck. You walked over and looked at the driver.\u00a0\u201cHey, my store is over there.\u00a0\u201c The driver nods and looks at you.\u00a0\u201cYeah, and your next shipment isn\u2019t until Friday. I\u2019m shipping to him.\u201d He pointed to the man walking out of the store. He was wearing a white hoodie and had his brunette hair pulled up, strands hanging in front of his eyes.\u00a0\u201cHi, I\u2019m Y/N. I own the flower shop across the road.\u201d He looks past you, checking out his new competition. He smiled and shook your hand.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m James, but you can call me Bucky.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He wasn\u2019t new to the city. He apparently\u00a0had lived in Brooklyn when he was younger. You saw a fall in your customers. Luckily the usuals still showed up. One of your customers being an older woman who constantly\u00a0tried to set you up with someone. One day, when you were getting her change, she looked at Bucky\u2019s shop.\u00a0\u201cYa know, the Barnes is a very handsome man.\u201d You nod, agreeing with her.\u00a0\u201cWould you ever date him?\u201d You blushed.\u00a0\u201cMa\u2019am, he\u2019s my\u00a0\u2018competition\u2019.\u201d She waved her hand at you.\u00a0\u201cA young person like you should be out dating. Your children would be adorable.\u201d Your face turned as red as the roses the women held. You could barely speak.</p><p>You had to admit that he was awfully cute. But you had no time to date, you were running a business after all.</p><p>On Valentine&rsquo;s day, you were so busy. Thankfully you were able to leave the shop early enough to buy a coffee and come back before people were rushing to buy roses. It was days like this that you wish you could have some kind of relationship. You noticed a small bouquet of roses sitting on the steps of the shop. You looked around, seeing who had left it. You saw Bucky standing by his front windows, smiling. You turned into your store and shook your head.\u00a0</p><p>The following day you walked to his store, placing a bouquet of violets and primrose on the stoop. You watched from the window of your store. He walked outside, glancing at the flowers and smiling brightly. His hair was pulled back into a very messy bun. He glanced at your store and smiled, waving at you. You waved back and smiled.</p><p>This continued on for another month. Except they go more and more extravagant. And as time went on you started to feel something for the cute florist. You woke up one morning and quickly rushed to the steps, he had left a small wooden vase, it had multicolored tulips. This time something was different, he had left a note. You read the note.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cyou looked really pretty with all those tulips yesterday :)\u201d</b></p><p>His handwriting was messy but still beautiful. You quickly made an arrangement of your blue flowers and wrote a note.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cthese flowers are almost as pretty as your eyes\u201d</b></p><p>Bucky had some of the most beautiful eyes you had ever seen. They sparkled when he spoke of his passions. You two spoke but never mentioned the bouquets, even though you knew it was each other.

Red roses with Madonna lilies. Damn, it was beautiful. You felt your cheeks turn red until you heard a door open behind you. Across the street stood your competitor, leaning against his door. You nodded and said to yourself. \u201cNice one, Barnes.\u201d This was just the beginning to your own cheesy love story.</p><p>You were one of the best florists in the city. You sold all kinds of flowers. Roses, daisies, sunflowers, name it. You also sold them at an affordable price. You had lived above the flower shop. People who lived nearby had known you as long as you lived there. You had seen the usual flower truck that dropped off your flowers across the street. You noticed a new face taking the flowers out of the back of the truck. You walked over and looked at the driver.\u00a0\u201cHey, my store is over there.\u00a0\u201c The driver nods and looks at you.\u00a0\u201cYeah, and your next shipment isn\u2019t until Friday. I\u2019m shipping to him.\u201d He pointed to the man walking out of the store. He was wearing a white hoodie and had his brunette hair pulled up, strands hanging in front of his eyes.\u00a0\u201cHi, I\u2019m Y/N. I own the flower shop across the road.\u201d He looks past you, checking out his new competition. He smiled and shook your hand.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m James, but you can call me Bucky.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He wasn\u2019t new to the city. He apparently\u00a0had lived in Brooklyn when he was younger. You saw a fall in your customers. Luckily the usuals still showed up. One of your customers being an older woman who constantly\u00a0tried to set you up with someone. One day, when you were getting her change, she looked at Bucky\u2019s shop.\u00a0\u201cYa know, the Barnes is a very handsome man.\u201d You nod, agreeing with her.\u00a0\u201cWould you ever date him?\u201d You blushed.\u00a0\u201cMa\u2019am, he\u2019s my\u00a0\u2018competition\u2019.\u201d She waved her hand at you.\u00a0\u201cA young person like you should be out dating. Your children would be adorable.\u201d Your face turned as red as the roses the women held. You could barely speak.</p><p>You had to admit that he was awfully cute. But you had no time to date, you were running a business after all.</p><p>On Valentine\u2019s day, you were so busy. Thankfully you were able to leave the shop early enough to buy a coffee and come back before people were rushing to buy roses. It was days like this that you wish you could have some kind of relationship. You noticed a small bouquet of roses sitting on the steps of the shop. You looked around, seeing who had left it. You saw Bucky standing by his front windows, smiling. You turned into your store and shook your head.\u00a0</p><p>The following day you walked to his store, placing a bouquet of violets and primrose on the stoop. You watched from the window of your store. He walked outside, glancing at the flowers and smiling brightly. His hair was pulled back into a very messy bun. He glanced at your store and smiled, waving at you. You waved back and smiled.</p><p>This continued on for another month. Except they go more and more extravagant. And as time went on you started to feel something for the cute florist. You woke up one morning and quickly rushed to the steps, he had left a small wooden vase, it had multicolored tulips. This time something was different, he had left a note. You read the note.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cyou looked really pretty with all those tulips yesterday :)\u201d</b></p><p>His handwriting was messy but still beautiful.

You sighed and took a sip of your tea. You heard someone knock on the door. You didn&rsquo;t bother to check who it was.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m closed until 11, sorry! If you&rsquo;d like an arrangement today, call the number on the door. Have a nice day!&rdquo; You continued to work on the arrangement when the phone rang. You stopped and picked it up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, my name is Y/N Y/L/N. Can I make a flowe-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, doll, it&rsquo;s me. Open the door please, I&rsquo;m getting soaked.&rdquo; You turned around quickly to see Bucky standing there. You quickly ran over, opening the door. He stepped in the store and looked you up and down. You were dressed in a hoodie and sweatpants. He smiles at you, one hand behind his back. He holds a single rose in front of him.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Esti atat de frumosa</i>.&rdquo; He chuckled when your face turned puzzled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I said you&rsquo;re so beautiful.&rdquo; You turned red and smiled brightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you, James.&nbsp;&ldquo; You moved to put the rose into a vase. You noticed him staring at the pile of flowers you had left on the counter.&nbsp;&ldquo;Were you trying to one-up me?&rdquo; You chuckled and nod. He reaches for your hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut this cutesy shit. Do you wanna go on a date?&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>i&rsquo;m so sorry this took so long! I was really busy or it kept getting deleted! I hope you guys like it.</p></p>",
