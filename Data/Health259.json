No, it\u2019s not all lullabies and cooing. Psychological bonds always have a physical underpinning. Like it or not, mother\u2019s milk has a drug-like effect on the baby\u2019s brain that ensures that the baby will bond with Mom and continue to nurse and get the nutrients all babies need. Like heroin or codeine, casomorphins slow intestinal movements and have a decided antidiarrheal effect.
