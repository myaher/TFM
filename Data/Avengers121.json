But at the end, he ends up staying with her - Anon</p><p>Warnings: None</p><p>Y/N: Your name</p><hr><p>\n\nIt was date night with your boyfriend Steve Rogers. It has been a while since the both of you hung out one on one and he came up with the idea of having an actual date night. But not one of those fancy ones where you get all dolled up and go out to eat at some crazy expensive restaurant. Just a casual, at home dinner date was all that was needed.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve been wanting to have one for a while now, but Steve would always get a call from work and have to leave. Of course you be a bit sad when he had to leave, but you never really showed it. You knew that he was the famous Captain America and would be needed at work from time to time. You didn&rsquo;t want him worrying about you being sad, you couldn&rsquo;t do that to him. To have him feel guilty about going to work would crush you.</p><!-- more --><p>As of the moment, you were having dinner with Steve and it was an enjoyable night. The stars were shining bright, the food you cooked was perfect, and you felt as if you two were the luckiest couple in the world. Now, you were just hoping that he didn&rsquo;t get a call from work.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Thank you for preparing the food, Y/N,&rdquo; he smiled,&ldquo; It was delicious.&rdquo;<br/><br/>His eyes sparkled in the dim lighting outside. Both your left arms were lying across the table, holding hands. You blushed softly as you looked down at the table cloth.<br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big deal, really,&rdquo; you smiled.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s been a while since we&rsquo;ve actually had some alone time together,&rdquo; he admitted gently standing up and holding out his arm for you to grab onto.<br/><br/>You smiled and gladly grabbed onto his arm, being pulled up. Soft, classical music was playing in the background as he led you to the grass. He placed his hands on your waist as you lightly grabbed his muscular shoulders. He leaned down, nuzzling his head into your neck, swaying from side to side to the music. No words were spoken as you rested your forehead on his chest.\u00a0<br/><br/>No words were needed.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; you whispered.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; he hummed, still swaying, but gave you his full and undivided attention. <br/><br/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been together for about-&rdquo;<br/><br/>His phone began to go off in his pocket, cutting your sentence off. You both had to pull away as he reached for it. He answered it as you stood there, lightly grabbing your arm. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Hello?&hellip; Right now?&hellip; Is it important?&hellip; Alright, bye,&rdquo; Steve spoke into the phone before turning it off putting it in his pocket. He looked up at you with an apologetic look.<br/><br/>&ldquo;They need me at the tower and I&rsquo;m terribly sorry for-&rdquo;<br/><br/>You held you hand up, shaking your head. You forced a smile as you lowered your hand.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, it&rsquo;s fine. You are Captain America, the leader of the Avengers, and they need their leader,&rdquo; you smiled, as he looked at you sadly,&ldquo; So cheer up and don&rsquo;t worry about me.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he asked, grabbing onto your hands. <br/><br/>You nodded your head and stood up on your tip-toes. You gently pressed your lips to his as he grabbed your waist, pulling you closer. You pulled away and stood back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Okay, but I&rsquo;m really sorry about this,&rdquo; he sighed as you lightly pushed him outside the door.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here by the time you get back, Snuggle Butt,&rdquo; you winked and lightly pinched his ass as he walked away. You could hear him chuckling, while he was walking away. He hoped onto his motorcycle and waved goodbye with a smile. You waved back, forcing the smile once more as he drove off.<br/><br/>You sighed, slowly closing the door. You walked to the back porch to clean up what was supposed to be your date night. Afterwards, you went your bedroom. You changed out of your outfit and was left in your undergarments. You grabbed one of Steve&rsquo;s shirts, since it was one of the things that made you feel safe at night when he wasn&rsquo;t there, and put it on. You slid into the bed and snuggled the sheets, wishing it was Steve.<br/></p><p>Later around two in the morning, Steve walked into the house tired. He dropped his shield down by the door and walked upstairs. He walked into the bedroom and changed out of his suit. He was left in his boxers and looked at your sleeping figure, cuddled with the duvet. He frowned, hating that he had bailed on you once again. He crawled into the bed with you and kissed your forehead as he smiled, seeing you in one of his shirts.\u00a0</p><p>Naturally, you gravitated towards him and laid your head on his chest, smiling in your sleep. He wrapped his arms around yours and drifted off to sleep.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Wake up, Beautiful,&rdquo; Steve called lightly shaking you.<br/><br/>You tiredly shook your head into your pillow, hence, not wanting to get up. You could hear him chuckle and place his hand on your head, lightly massaging it. You enjoyed the feeling, especially when you first wake up. When he stopped you slowly turned your head on the pillow so your face was facing his. <br/><br/>No sun was illuminating the room and you furrowed your eyebrows. You turned your head to look at the clock and it was only 5:10 in the morning. You pouted and turned back to Steve, who was standing in his jogging clothes.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Why are you waking me up so early?&rdquo; you huffed.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Because, I&rsquo;m going for a jog and when I come back, I want you up,&rdquo; he smiled, innocently.<br/><br/>&ldquo;But, but-&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;And wear some comfortable clothes, we&rsquo;re not going to be going anywhere,&rdquo; he said cutting you off.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Alright, but I&rsquo;m still wearing this shirt,&rdquo; you grinned, rolling onto your back instead of on your stomach. <br/><br/>&ldquo;I knew you would,&rdquo; he said bending down and giving you a quick peck,&ldquo; I&rsquo;ll be back in a bit.&rdquo;<br/><br/>His warm touch faded quickly as he left the room. You could hear the front door closing, telling you that he had left and you smiled. You sat up, rubbing your arms and swung your legs over the edge of the bed, yawning. It better be important if he&rsquo;s waking you up this early. You stood up and walked to the bathroom to get ready.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Are you awake, Beautiful?&rdquo; Steve called from downstairs the moment he came back, with his hands on his hips. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; you replied and hopped downstairs in his overly-sized shirt on your body. You jumped into his arms as he caught you, hugging you tightly. You happily kissed his lips and pulled away before he could go any further. He pouted and you gave a light laugh.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;You said we had some plans, right?&rdquo;<br/><br/>He smiled and nodded his head. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said carrying you over to the living room, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s movie night.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh! Can I choose it?&rdquo; you asked giving him puppy dog eyes while batting them.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I was already going to let you, go crazy,&rdquo; he smiled and walked to sit down on the couch. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Good, because Tony gave me one and said that you would know of it,&rdquo; You said pulling a disk out of the case Tony gave you and put it in the DVD player. You walked over to Steve and sat down on his lap. He grabbed the blanket that was draped behind the couch and wrapped it around you both. You snuggled against his chest as the movie began.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Steve muttered.<br/><br/>&ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; you asked looking up Steve&rsquo;s face. The movie was in black and white, meaning a classic, Steve&rsquo;s favorite. You didn&rsquo;t see a problem.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Tony</i>,&rdquo; Steve muttered under his breath, shaking his head, &ldquo;How did he find this movie?&rdquo;<br/><br/>You furrowed your eyebrows as you looked back at the television screen. And soon the words <b><i>The Grand Adventures of Captain America!</i></b> appeared on the screen. You gasped with a wide grin across your face and covered it with your hand looking up at Steve.<br/><br/>He looked away in embarrassment and you pulled his face back with your finger. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Was that you when you were first Captain America?&rdquo; you grinned.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;,&rdquo; he muttered shyly. You giggled and turned back to the television.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you still look hot in your tights,&rdquo; you said. He blushed and watched the movie with you. During the movie you couldn&rsquo;t stop grinning watching Steve &ldquo;fight&rdquo; in the movie. He was leading the army into battle and when he rode his motorcycle he looked so stiff. <br/><br/>&ldquo;So when you were riding the motorcycle..,&rdquo; you trailed off, he placed his hand over your mouth.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even want to talk about it,&rdquo; he grinned.<br/><br/>In the movie, he was fighting the army and you could tell he was uncomfortable. He would sometimes awkwardly stand there, stutter over a few lines, or sometimes be a bit faster than everyone else. You giggled at a few parts, and Steve kept looking away at some parts. In the end, of course, Steve was walking back in victory. And soon the film ended. You turned to face Steve with a wide grin.<br/><br/>&ldquo;So <i>that </i>was you in the forties?&rdquo; you teased pinching his cheek. <br/><br/>&ldquo;I-,\u201d he sighed, rolling his eyes, \u201cIt was a new thing for me.\u201d<br/><br/>&quot;And you were wearing some really tight tights,&rdquo; you continued.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remind me,&rdquo; he muttered leaning in for a kiss, but you pressed your finger against his lip. He looked at your finger, pouted, and looked back up at you. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Not that easy Captain, you gotta fight for it,&rdquo; you winked. He raised his eyebrows in amusement.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; he muttered as you pushed him below you, playfully. You were straddling above him as he gave you a challenging look. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Yes it is,&rdquo; you giggled. And soon his fingers were by your hips and he began to tickle you. You collapsed on top of him, laughing uncontrollably. He kept tickling you every time you would try to escape. And when he leaned down to kiss you, you would always turn your face, which only made him want to tickle you even more. You were very ticklish and he was using it as an advantage. But when you quickly escaped holding your sides which hurt from all the laughing, he quickly scooped you up and walked away from the couch,&ldquo; Hey! Unfair!&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine,&rdquo; he purred leaning in once again, but you ducked and quickly squirmed out of his grasp. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Not that easy I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; you laughed and ran to the backyard, he chuckled and followed after you. As he tried to catch you, you tackled him and landed on top of him. He looked like he was about to surrender when he then rolled and was on top of you this time. <br/><br/>&ldquo;You know I think I won-&rdquo;<br/><br/>And then that familiar ring was heard again. His phone was going off again and you mood went down dramatically. However you still plastered a smile on your face as he reached for his back pocket. He looked at the screen, at you, and then grinned. You were preparing for him to leave again, but this time, he threw his phone to the side. You widened your eyes in shock as you watched the phone fly through the air and collapse on the grass. No where in sight.<br/><br/>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you-&rdquo;<br/><br/>And he quickly pressed his lips to yours. You giggled into the kiss and grabbed the back of his neck, pulling him closer. Your lips molded together, moving in sync until he pulled away.<br/><br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re much more important than work,&rdquo; he said pulling you on top of him and continuing to kiss you. And by the end of the night, Steve definitely had won.\n\n<br/></p>",

The stars were shining bright, the food you cooked was perfect, and you felt as if you two were the luckiest couple in the world. Now, you were just hoping that he didn\u2019t get a call from work.<br><br>\u201cThank you for preparing the food, Y/N,\u201d he smiled,\u201c It was delicious.\u201d<br><br>His eyes sparkled in the dim lighting outside. Both your left arms were lying across the table, holding hands. You blushed softly as you looked down at the table cloth.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, really,\u201d you smiled.<br><br>\u201cI know it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve actually had some alone time together,\u201d he admitted gently standing up and holding out his arm for you to grab onto.<br><br>You smiled and gladly grabbed onto his arm, being pulled up. Soft, classical music was playing in the background as he led you to the grass. He placed his hands on your waist as you lightly grabbed his muscular shoulders. He leaned down, nuzzling his head into your neck, swaying from side to side to the music. No words were spoken as you rested your forehead on his chest.\u00a0<br><br>No words were needed.<br><br>\u201cSteve,\u201d you whispered.<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d he hummed, still swaying, but gave you his full and undivided attention. <br><br>\u201cWe\u2019ve been together for about-\u201d<br><br>His phone began to go off in his pocket, cutting your sentence off. You both had to pull away as he reached for it. He answered it as you stood there, lightly grabbing your arm. <br><br>\u201cHello?\u2026 Right now?\u2026 Is it important?\u2026 Alright, bye,\u201d Steve spoke into the phone before turning it off putting it in his pocket. He looked up at you with an apologetic look.<br><br>\u201cThey need me at the tower and I\u2019m terribly sorry for-\u201d<br><br>You held you hand up, shaking your head. You forced a smile as you lowered your hand.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s fine. You are Captain America, the leader of the Avengers, and they need their leader,\u201d you smiled, as he looked at you sadly,\u201c So cheer up and don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, grabbing onto your hands. <br><br>You nodded your head and stood up on your tip-toes. You gently pressed your lips to his as he grabbed your waist, pulling you closer. You pulled away and stood back. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m really sorry about this,\u201d he sighed as you lightly pushed him outside the door.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll be here by the time you get back, Snuggle Butt,\u201d you winked and lightly pinched his ass as he walked away. You could hear him chuckling, while he was walking away. He hoped onto his motorcycle and waved goodbye with a smile. You waved back, forcing the smile once more as he drove off.<br><br>You sighed, slowly closing the door. You walked to the back porch to clean up what was supposed to be your date night. Afterwards, you went your bedroom. You changed out of your outfit and was left in your undergarments. You grabbed one of Steve\u2019s shirts, since it was one of the things that made you feel safe at night when he wasn\u2019t there, and put it on. You slid into the bed and snuggled the sheets, wishing it was Steve.<br></p><p>Later around two in the morning, Steve walked into the house tired. He dropped his shield down by the door and walked upstairs. He walked into the bedroom and changed out of his suit. He was left in his boxers and looked at your sleeping figure, cuddled with the duvet. He frowned, hating that he had bailed on you once again. He crawled into the bed with you and kissed your forehead as he smiled, seeing you in one of his shirts.\u00a0</p><p>Naturally, you gravitated towards him and laid your head on his chest, smiling in your sleep. He wrapped his arms around yours and drifted off to sleep.</p><hr><p>\u201cWake up, Beautiful,\u201d Steve called lightly shaking you.<br><br>You tiredly shook your head into your pillow, hence, not wanting to get up. You could hear him chuckle and place his hand on your head, lightly massaging it. You enjoyed the feeling, especially when you first wake up. When he stopped you slowly turned your head on the pillow so your face was facing his. <br><br>No sun was illuminating the room and you furrowed your eyebrows. You turned your head to look at the clock and it was only 5:10 in the morning. You pouted and turned back to Steve, who was standing in his jogging clothes.<br><br>\u201cWhy are you waking me up so early?\u201d you huffed.<br><br>\u201cBecause, I\u2019m going for a jog and when I come back, I want you up,\u201d he smiled, innocently.<br><br>\u201cBut, but-\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd wear some comfortable clothes, we\u2019re not going to be going anywhere,\u201d he said cutting you off.<br><br>\u201cAlright, but I\u2019m still wearing this shirt,\u201d you grinned, rolling onto your back instead of on your stomach. <br><br>\u201cI knew you would,\u201d he said bending down and giving you a quick peck,\u201c I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d<br><br>His warm touch faded quickly as he left the room. You could hear the front door closing, telling you that he had left and you smiled. You sat up, rubbing your arms and swung your legs over the edge of the bed, yawning. It better be important if he\u2019s waking you up this early. You stood up and walked to the bathroom to get ready.</p><hr><p>\u201cAre you awake, Beautiful?\u201d Steve called from downstairs the moment he came back, with his hands on his hips. <br><br>\u201cYep!\u201d you replied and hopped downstairs in his overly-sized shirt on your body. You jumped into his arms as he caught you, hugging you tightly. You happily kissed his lips and pulled away before he could go any further. He pouted and you gave a light laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou said we had some plans, right?\u201d<br><br>He smiled and nodded his head. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said carrying you over to the living room, \u201cIt\u2019s movie night.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh! Can I choose it?\u201d you asked giving him puppy dog eyes while batting them.<br><br>\u201cI was already going to let you, go crazy,\u201d he smiled and walked to sit down on the couch. <br><br>\u201cGood, because Tony gave me one and said that you would know of it,\u201d You said pulling a disk out of the case Tony gave you and put it in the DVD player. You walked over to Steve and sat down on his lap. He grabbed the blanket that was draped behind the couch and wrapped it around you both. You snuggled against his chest as the movie began.<br><br>\u201cOh no,\u201d Steve muttered.<br><br>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d you asked looking up Steve\u2019s face. The movie was in black and white, meaning a classic, Steve\u2019s favorite. You didn\u2019t see a problem.<br><br>\u201c<i>Tony</i>,\u201d Steve muttered under his breath, shaking his head, \u201cHow did he find this movie?\u201d<br><br>You furrowed your eyebrows as you looked back at the television screen. And soon the words <b><i>The Grand Adventures of Captain America!</i></b> appeared on the screen. You gasped with a wide grin across your face and covered it with your hand looking up at Steve.<br><br>He looked away in embarrassment and you pulled his face back with your finger. <br><br>\u201cWas that you when you were first Captain America?\u201d you grinned.<br><br>\u201cYeah\u2026,\u201d he muttered shyly. You giggled and turned back to the television.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you still look hot in your tights,\u201d you said. He blushed and watched the movie with you. During the movie you couldn\u2019t stop grinning watching Steve \u201cfight\u201d in the movie. He was leading the army into battle and when he rode his motorcycle he looked so stiff. <br><br>\u201cSo when you were riding the motorcycle..,\u201d you trailed off, he placed his hand over your mouth.<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk about it,\u201d he grinned.<br><br>In the movie, he was fighting the army and you could tell he was uncomfortable. He would sometimes awkwardly stand there, stutter over a few lines, or sometimes be a bit faster than everyone else. You giggled at a few parts, and Steve kept looking away at some parts. In the end, of course, Steve was walking back in victory. And soon the film ended. You turned to face Steve with a wide grin.<br><br>\u201cSo <i>that </i>was you in the forties?\u201d you teased pinching his cheek. <br><br>\u201cI-,\u201d he sighed, rolling his eyes, \u201cIt was a new thing for me.\u201d<br><br>\"And you were wearing some really tight tights,\u201d you continued.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he muttered leaning in for a kiss, but you pressed your finger against his lip. He looked at your finger, pouted, and looked back up at you. <br><br>\u201cNot that easy Captain, you gotta fight for it,\u201d you winked. He raised his eyebrows in amusement.<br><br>\u201cIs that so?\u201d he muttered as you pushed him below you, playfully. You were straddling above him as he gave you a challenging look. <br><br>\u201cYes it is,\u201d you giggled. And soon his fingers were by your hips and he began to tickle you. You collapsed on top of him, laughing uncontrollably. He kept tickling you every time you would try to escape. And when he leaned down to kiss you, you would always turn your face, which only made him want to tickle you even more. You were very ticklish and he was using it as an advantage.

As he tried to catch you, you tackled him and landed on top of him. He looked like he was about to surrender when he then rolled and was on top of you this time. <br><br>\u201cYou know I think I won-\u201d<br><br>And then that familiar ring was heard again.

You could hear him chuckle and place his hand on your head, lightly massaging it. You enjoyed the feeling, especially when you first wake up. When he stopped you slowly turned your head on the pillow so your face was facing his. <br><br>No sun was illuminating the room and you furrowed your eyebrows. You turned your head to look at the clock and it was only 5:10 in the morning. You pouted and turned back to Steve, who was standing in his jogging clothes.<br><br>\u201cWhy are you waking me up so early?\u201d you huffed.<br><br>\u201cBecause, I\u2019m going for a jog and when I come back, I want you up,\u201d he smiled, innocently.<br><br>\u201cBut, but-\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd wear some comfortable clothes, we\u2019re not going to be going anywhere,\u201d he said cutting you off.<br><br>\u201cAlright, but I\u2019m still wearing this shirt,\u201d you grinned, rolling onto your back instead of on your stomach. <br><br>\u201cI knew you would,\u201d he said bending down and giving you a quick peck,\u201c I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d<br><br>His warm touch faded quickly as he left the room. You could hear the front door closing, telling you that he had left and you smiled. You sat up, rubbing your arms and swung your legs over the edge of the bed, yawning. It better be important if he\u2019s waking you up this early. You stood up and walked to the bathroom to get ready.</p><hr><p>\u201cAre you awake, Beautiful?\u201d Steve called from downstairs the moment he came back, with his hands on his hips. <br><br>\u201cYep!\u201d you replied and hopped downstairs in his overly-sized shirt on your body. You jumped into his arms as he caught you, hugging you tightly. You happily kissed his lips and pulled away before he could go any further. He pouted and you gave a light laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou said we had some plans, right?\u201d<br><br>He smiled and nodded his head. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said carrying you over to the living room, \u201cIt\u2019s movie night.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh! Can I choose it?\u201d you asked giving him puppy dog eyes while batting them.<br><br>\u201cI was already going to let you, go crazy,\u201d he smiled and walked to sit down on the couch. <br><br>\u201cGood, because Tony gave me one and said that you would know of it,\u201d You said pulling a disk out of the case Tony gave you and put it in the DVD player. You walked over to Steve and sat down on his lap. He grabbed the blanket that was draped behind the couch and wrapped it around you both. You snuggled against his chest as the movie began.<br><br>\u201cOh no,\u201d Steve muttered.<br><br>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d you asked looking up Steve\u2019s face. The movie was in black and white, meaning a classic, Steve\u2019s favorite. You didn\u2019t see a problem.<br><br>\u201c<i>Tony</i>,\u201d Steve muttered under his breath, shaking his head, \u201cHow did he find this movie?\u201d<br><br>You furrowed your eyebrows as you looked back at the television screen. And soon the words <b><i>The Grand Adventures of Captain America!</i></b> appeared on the screen. You gasped with a wide grin across your face and covered it with your hand looking up at Steve.<br><br>He looked away in embarrassment and you pulled his face back with your finger. <br><br>\u201cWas that you when you were first Captain America?\u201d you grinned.<br><br>\u201cYeah\u2026,\u201d he muttered shyly. You giggled and turned back to the television.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you still look hot in your tights,\u201d you said. He blushed and watched the movie with you. During the movie you couldn\u2019t stop grinning watching Steve \u201cfight\u201d in the movie. He was leading the army into battle and when he rode his motorcycle he looked so stiff. <br><br>\u201cSo when you were riding the motorcycle..,\u201d you trailed off, he placed his hand over your mouth.<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk about it,\u201d he grinned.<br><br>In the movie, he was fighting the army and you could tell he was uncomfortable. He would sometimes awkwardly stand there, stutter over a few lines, or sometimes be a bit faster than everyone else. You giggled at a few parts, and Steve kept looking away at some parts. In the end, of course, Steve was walking back in victory. And soon the film ended. You turned to face Steve with a wide grin.<br><br>\u201cSo <i>that </i>was you in the forties?\u201d you teased pinching his cheek. <br><br>\u201cI-,\u201d he sighed, rolling his eyes, \u201cIt was a new thing for me.\u201d<br><br>\"And you were wearing some really tight tights,\u201d you continued.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he muttered leaning in for a kiss, but you pressed your finger against his lip. He looked at your finger, pouted, and looked back up at you. <br><br>\u201cNot that easy Captain, you gotta fight for it,\u201d you winked. He raised his eyebrows in amusement.<br><br>\u201cIs that so?\u201d he muttered as you pushed him below you, playfully. You were straddling above him as he gave you a challenging look. <br><br>\u201cYes it is,\u201d you giggled. And soon his fingers were by your hips and he began to tickle you. You collapsed on top of him, laughing uncontrollably. He kept tickling you every time you would try to escape. And when he leaned down to kiss you, you would always turn your face, which only made him want to tickle you even more. You were very ticklish and he was using it as an advantage. But when you quickly escaped holding your sides which hurt from all the laughing, he quickly scooped you up and walked away from the couch,\u201c Hey! Unfair!\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he purred leaning in once again, but you ducked and quickly squirmed out of his grasp. <br><br>\u201cNot that easy I\u2019m not!\u201d you laughed and ran to the backyard, he chuckled and followed after you. As he tried to catch you, you tackled him and landed on top of him. He looked like he was about to surrender when he then rolled and was on top of you this time. <br><br>\u201cYou know I think I won-\u201d<br><br>And then that familiar ring was heard again. His phone was going off again and you mood went down dramatically. However you still plastered a smile on your face as he reached for his back pocket. He looked at the screen, at you, and then grinned. You were preparing for him to leave again, but this time, he threw his phone to the side. You widened your eyes in shock as you watched the phone fly through the air and collapse on the grass. No where in sight.<br><br>\u201cBut don\u2019t you-\u201d<br><br>And he quickly pressed his lips to yours. You giggled into the kiss and grabbed the back of his neck, pulling him closer. Your lips molded together, moving in sync until he pulled away.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re much more important than work,\u201d he said pulling you on top of him and continuing to kiss you. And by the end of the night, Steve definitely had won.\n\n<br></p></p>",

It has been a while since the both of you hung out one on one and he came up with the idea of having an actual date night. But not one of those fancy ones where you get all dolled up and go out to eat at some crazy expensive restaurant. Just a casual, at home dinner date was all that was needed.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve been wanting to have one for a while now, but Steve would always get a call from work and have to leave. Of course you be a bit sad when he had to leave, but you never really showed it. You knew that he was the famous Captain America and would be needed at work from time to time. You didn&rsquo;t want him worrying about you being sad, you couldn&rsquo;t do that to him. To have him feel guilty about going to work would crush you.</p><p>As of the moment, you were having dinner with Steve and it was an enjoyable night. The stars were shining bright, the food you cooked was perfect, and you felt as if you two were the luckiest couple in the world. Now, you were just hoping that he didn&rsquo;t get a call from work.<br /><br />&ldquo;Thank you for preparing the food, Y/N,&rdquo; he smiled,&ldquo; It was delicious.&rdquo;<br /><br />His eyes sparkled in the dim lighting outside. Both your left arms were lying across the table, holding hands. You blushed softly as you looked down at the table cloth.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big deal, really,&rdquo; you smiled.<br /><br />&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s been a while since we&rsquo;ve actually had some alone time together,&rdquo; he admitted gently standing up and holding out his arm for you to grab onto.<br /><br />You smiled and gladly grabbed onto his arm, being pulled up. Soft, classical music was playing in the background as he led you to the grass. He placed his hands on your waist as you lightly grabbed his muscular shoulders. He leaned down, nuzzling his head into your neck, swaying from side to side to the music. No words were spoken as you rested your forehead on his chest.&nbsp;<br /><br />No words were needed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; you whispered.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; he hummed, still swaying, but gave you his full and undivided attention. <br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been together for about-&rdquo;<br /><br />His phone began to go off in his pocket, cutting your sentence off. You both had to pull away as he reached for it. He answered it as you stood there, lightly grabbing your arm. <br /><br />&ldquo;Hello?&hellip; Right now?&hellip; Is it important?&hellip; Alright, bye,&rdquo; Steve spoke into the phone before turning it off putting it in his pocket. He looked up at you with an apologetic look.<br /><br />&ldquo;They need me at the tower and I&rsquo;m terribly sorry for-&rdquo;<br /><br />You held you hand up, shaking your head. You forced a smile as you lowered your hand.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, it&rsquo;s fine. You are Captain America, the leader of the Avengers, and they need their leader,&rdquo; you smiled, as he looked at you sadly,&ldquo; So cheer up and don&rsquo;t worry about me.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he asked, grabbing onto your hands. <br /><br />You nodded your head and stood up on your tip-toes. You gently pressed your lips to his as he grabbed your waist, pulling you closer. You pulled away and stood back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Okay, but I&rsquo;m really sorry about this,&rdquo; he sighed as you lightly pushed him outside the door.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here by the time you get back, Snuggle Butt,&rdquo; you winked and lightly pinched his ass as he walked away. You could hear him chuckling, while he was walking away. He hoped onto his motorcycle and waved goodbye with a smile. You waved back, forcing the smile once more as he drove off.<br /><br />You sighed, slowly closing the door. You walked to the back porch to clean up what was supposed to be your date night. Afterwards, you went your bedroom. You changed out of your outfit and was left in your undergarments. You grabbed one of Steve&rsquo;s shirts, since it was one of the things that made you feel safe at night when he wasn&rsquo;t there, and put it on. You slid into the bed and snuggled the sheets, wishing it was Steve.<br /></p><p>Later around two in the morning, Steve walked into the house tired. He dropped his shield down by the door and walked upstairs. He walked into the bedroom and changed out of his suit. He was left in his boxers and looked at your sleeping figure, cuddled with the duvet. He frowned, hating that he had bailed on you once again. He crawled into the bed with you and kissed your forehead as he smiled, seeing you in one of his shirts.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, you gravitated towards him and laid your head on his chest, smiling in your sleep. He wrapped his arms around yours and drifted off to sleep.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Wake up, Beautiful,&rdquo; Steve called lightly shaking you.<br /><br />You tiredly shook your head into your pillow, hence, not wanting to get up.
