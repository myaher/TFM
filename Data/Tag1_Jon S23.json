She could imagine that was true for certain journeys and especially for life, but it surely wasn\u2019t true for traveling from point A to B and especially not when point A was her childhood home and the castle she was now ruling and point B was the place where she would meet the man she loved again for the first time in a very long while.</p><p>\u201cMy Queen?\u201d One of her loyal knights cleared his throat when he made his horse fall into step with hers. \u201cDue to the excellent weather circumstances we will reach Castle Black tonight.

The air had been much colder at the time and falling snow had slowed them down tremendously, but just like now Sansa had kept herself going by thinking of Jon, of once more feeling his strong arms embracing her, of knowing that maybe together they could take everything back that was stolen from them, from the Starks. </p><p>Now there was only one more thing they should right. </p><!-- more --><p>They had taken their home back. They had protected it against each and every threat, against both ice and fire. Maybe, after everything they had been through, everything they had endured, all those times they had suffered, the Gods had finally been on their side.</p><p>But Jon still wasn\u2019t home and without him there it would always feel as if a small piece of the puzzle was missing, as if the happily ever after they had worked for hadn\u2019t arrived yet, as if they had not yet reached the end of their long and tiring journey.</p><p>It was another journey that had never been about the journey itself for Sansa. The journey had been painful, filled with moments she could have lived and done without, filled with misery and heartbreak. It was because of the journey that she had quickly grown into the woman she was nowadays, but she liked to believe that she would have become the Queen she deserved to be anyway, even if it would have taken her a little longer.</p><p>Sansa straightened her back and lifted her chin however. She was surrounded by guards and people who looked up at her, who had wanted her to be their Queen, who didn\u2019t mind that she was a woman. All those people had suffered in their own way, but here they were, stronger than they had ever been and finally independent.</p><p>\u201cQueen Sansa\u2026\u201d Fredrik cleared his throat and he tightened his grip on the reins of his horse. His knuckles paled. \u201cI hope that you won\u2019t mind the question, but we were wondering\u2026\u201d He hesitated for a moment and Sansa was bracing herself for whatever question or request would follow. \u201cDo we still need to address King Jon as our King?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised her and in a way it overwhelmed her too. </p><p>Technically Jon was no King in the North anymore. He had laid down his title when he had kneeled for Daenerys to get her help in the long night. He had never claimed it back and maybe deep down he had not even wanted it back. He was good at ruling, but it didn\u2019t seem to be something that actually made him happy.</p><p>\u201cI will discuss that matter with him.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips. \u201cI assume there won\u2019t be any spies or prying eyes around, but I would suggest that it might be better to not call him King.\u201d </p><p>It was a lesson she had learned the hard way. There could always be someone listening to every word you said, waiting to report it to whomever could use the information. And even though the war was over and Westeros was relatively at peace, there were quite certainly still people with bad intentions. There would always be people with bad intentions.</p><p>Fredrik nodded. \u201cYou are right, my Queen.\u201d He bent his head slightly. \u201cHow should we address him then?\u201d </p><p>Once Jon had been Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch. But Sansa wasn\u2019t sure if calling Jon Lord Snow would still be appropriate. Most of the time he was not even with the actual Night\u2019s Watch. He much preferred spending his days even much further North, with the Wildlings he had won over and who had embraced him as one of their own. </p><p>\u201cIt will be the first thing I will ask him.\u201d Sansa nodded once more at her companion and then she saw the contours of the castle appearing on the horizon. Instinctively she planted her heels in the flanks of her horse to make him go faster and within a few seconds she had broken free from the caravan.</p><p>The castle in the distance grew bigger and bigger, just like the smile on Sansa\u2019s face while she rushed through the gate and jumped down on the still frozen floor. </p><p>A familiar face appeared on top of the wooden stairs. His black curls had grown longer and wilder, but it had only made him look more handsome. As soon as his eyes found hers the smile on his face brightened and the frown on his forehead faded. He rushed down the stairs and less than a second later Sansa felt his strong arms around her, lifting her feet up from the ground. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u2026\u201d She whispered and she buried her nose in his hair while she wrapped her arms around his neck. He smelled like wood and snow and pine and yet it was the smell of home and safety and forever. \u201cMy King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d Jon gently placed her down again and he pressed the palms of his hands to her warm cheeks. \u201cMy Queen.\u201d He leaned in and they both closed their eyes when their lips, after all this time and all those letters, finally met.</p>",

His knuckles paled. \u201cI hope that you won\u2019t mind the question, but we were wondering\u2026\u201d He hesitated for a moment and Sansa was bracing herself for whatever question or request would follow. \u201cDo we still need to address King Jon as our King?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised her and in a way it overwhelmed her too. </p><p>Technically Jon was no King in the North anymore. He had laid down his title when he had kneeled for Daenerys to get her help in the long night. He had never claimed it back and maybe deep down he had not even wanted it back. He was good at ruling, but it didn\u2019t seem to be something that actually made him happy.</p><p>\u201cI will discuss that matter with him.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips. \u201cI assume there won\u2019t be any spies or prying eyes around, but I would suggest that it might be better to not call him King.\u201d </p><p>It was a lesson she had learned the hard way. There could always be someone listening to every word you said, waiting to report it to whomever could use the information. And even though the war was over and Westeros was relatively at peace, there were quite certainly still people with bad intentions. There would always be people with bad intentions.</p><p>Fredrik nodded. \u201cYou are right, my Queen.\u201d He bent his head slightly. \u201cHow should we address him then?\u201d </p><p>Once Jon had been Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch. But Sansa wasn\u2019t sure if calling Jon Lord Snow would still be appropriate. Most of the time he was not even with the actual Night\u2019s Watch. He much preferred spending his days even much further North, with the Wildlings he had won over and who had embraced him as one of their own. </p><p>\u201cIt will be the first thing I will ask him.\u201d Sansa nodded once more at her companion and then she saw the contours of the castle appearing on the horizon. Instinctively she planted her heels in the flanks of her horse to make him go faster and within a few seconds she had broken free from the caravan.</p><p>The castle in the distance grew bigger and bigger, just like the smile on Sansa\u2019s face while she rushed through the gate and jumped down on the still frozen floor. </p><p>A familiar face appeared on top of the wooden stairs. His black curls had grown longer and wilder, but it had only made him look more handsome. As soon as his eyes found hers the smile on his face brightened and the frown on his forehead faded. He rushed down the stairs and less than a second later Sansa felt his strong arms around her, lifting her feet up from the ground. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u2026\u201d She whispered and she buried her nose in his hair while she wrapped her arms around his neck. He smelled like wood and snow and pine and yet it was the smell of home and safety and forever. \u201cMy King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d Jon gently placed her down again and he pressed the palms of his hands to her warm cheeks. \u201cMy Queen.\u201d He leaned in and they both closed their eyes when their lips, after all this time and all those letters, finally met.</p></p>",
