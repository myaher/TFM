She was much the same at Winterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom winked at her as he sang:</p><p><i>And how she smiled and how she laughed,<br />the maiden of the tree.<br />She spun away and said to him,<br />no featherbed for me.<br />I&rsquo;ll wear a gown of golden leaves,<br />and bind my hair with grass,<br />But you can be my forest love,<br />and me your forest lass.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I have no gowns of leaves,&rdquo; said Lady Smallwood with a small fond smile, &ldquo;but Carellen left some other dresses that might serve. Come, child, let us go upstairs and see what we can find.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><ul><li>\n\nGendry is jealous of Arya spending time with Edric, Beric&rsquo;s squire. And it&rsquo;s not because he&rsquo;s a noble. He&rsquo;s jealous before he finds out he&rsquo;s high-born. He just doesn&lsquo;t like the little fucker spending time with <i>his</i> Arya!<br /></li><li>Gendry was pissed off that Arya called him her brother.<br /></li><li>Arya spends multiple chapters jealous over the possibility that Gendry was off\"ringing\" some girl&rsquo;s &ldquo;bells.&rdquo; Ie, fucking another girl (even if she doesn&rsquo;t understand that yet).</li><li>Arya literally described Gendry&rsquo;s hair falling over his face, his eyes in detail, his muscles, how his forge-work was like beautiful music.<br /></li></ul><p>But yeah, sure, in the books, there are no hints of romance between Arya and Gendry. Ugh, I&rsquo;m so tired of people ignoring the obvious, in-your-face Arya/Gendry romance-is-coming because &ndash; </p><p>(A) Shipping is some <i>Twilight</i>/bullshit thing.<br />(B) Gendry and/or Arya randomly belongs with another character out of the blue that has absolutely ZERO background, ZERO build-up and is completely out of character despite EVERYTHING pointing to Arya and Gendry.<br />&copy; Arya&rsquo;s a killer! OMGZ! Never mind that some other ships have &ldquo;killers&rdquo; in them too. Those &ldquo;killers&rdquo; just happen to be male and apparently one can kill and have a romance as long as you have a penis, but heaven forbid one be allowed to do so if you have a vagina!<br />(D) But, but, but&hellip;. Arya was a child when she and Gendry first met!! Well, in the books, Gendry was 14&hellip; so what of it? And, screw the haters, no one but perverted sickos were actually shipping Arya when she was 9 and Gendry was 14, for fuck&rsquo;s sake! It&rsquo;s all about the foundation, you dumb fucks! It&rsquo;s about the potential romance, future romance&hellip; you know, because of&hellip; wait for it &hellip;</p><p>ALL OF THE HINTS IN THE BOOKS ABOUT THE ARYA AND GENDRY ROMANCE TO COME! Because, yeah, fucking GOT Fandom Wikia, you are bloody wrong! There are a shit-ton of hints, hell, there are more than hints, there 1000-ton anvils about an eventual Arya/Gendry romance!</p>",

        "caption": "<h2>Day Ten</h2><p><b>Arya and Gendry get snowed into the forge.</b></p><!-- more --><p>There were only a few days remaining before the winter holidays and Arya was getting antsy. This would be the first holiday her remaining family spent together. Jon promised that even he would make the trip north. The last raven said he would be here on the morrow. </p><p>Sansa was excited as well, but she was the one in charge of ruling and running Winterfell, so she did not have enough time to get truly excited. Bran never got excited about much anymore. Arya missed her younger brother\u2019s old behavior that was filled with unending joy and curiosity. Arya only had one person she could still connect with, Gendry. Ever since they were reunited before the war their connection had intensified more than when they were younger. At first Arya was angry at Gendry for leaving her when they were kids, but she knew better than blame him for his previous actions. It was a different time, and they were different people. Hells, she was only a shell of the girl she used to be. Living in Bravos and training under the faceless men had made her lose part of herself. Thankfully, being around her family and friends and made it possible for her to regain some of what she had lost, but her childhood innocence would forever be lost in the free cities. </p><p>Arya was trekking across Winterfell\u2019s courtyard and into the small building that was the castle\u2019s forge. The snow was beginning to fall harshly and gather in large two foot piles around the yard. The groundskeepers was busying themselves with shoveling it into piles on the sides of stone buildings. Most likely praying that the hot springs that flowed through each building\u2019s stone walls would melt the piles of snow. If it piled any higher Arya would be buried up to the waist.</p><p>She approached the forge and listened to the repetitive pounding and clashing of metal on metal. The sounds and the scent mixed in the air and all Arya could think of was Gendry. He had been so happy when Arya showed him the smithy. All the work he had done for the great war had been at Dragon Stone and Castle Black, they had only stopped in Winterfell for a mere few days before continuing even farther north. </p><p>The look that crossed his face when they saw each other for the first time in years is one that Arya will never forget. There was a mixture of sadness and amazement in Gendry\u2019s eyes. It was a very similar look to the one he wore when he lost his bull helm many years ago. Arya always wondered if he would remake one for himself someday; she hoped he would, but maybe she just wanted to relive her happy memories.</p><p>Arya never bothered to knock when she entered the forge. She was used to seeing the men\u2019s bare torsos. They never heard her knock anyway, however, they no longer were shocked at her sudden appearance. She ignored the looks they gave her. She could hear many of them mutter that the forge was no place for a lady, but little did they know she was no lady at all. The only one in the smithy that truly understood her was Gendry. He made her life much more adventurous and joyful since his return. As much as she loved her sister and her brothers, they had all grown so much and into very different people than when they were younger. The only one that was around her for most of her adolescent life was Gendry and his understanding of her upbringing made it easier to tell him stories than the rest of her remaining family. \u00a0</p><p>Arya had to admit that the way she looked at her friend changed over the years. She was with him while she was transitioning into womanhood. She remembered the very moment she realized that how she viewed most men changed. That day at Harrenhall when Gendry was practicing swordplay shirtless was some sort of sexual awakening for her younger self. Thinking back on the memory, Arya started to realize just how sinful the situation had been. Her brother was at war, her sister held captive in King\u2019s Landing, and Arya was ogling her best friend\u2019s chizeled figure. She knew she should feel bad, but she didn\u2019t. Even now she couldn\u2019t stop herself from appreciating how handsome he was. He had only gotten more muscular and handsome in their time apart. War had hardened him more as well and left him scarred, but Arya didn\u2019t mind. Scars littered her body as well. She had a very large and wide scar that the waif had given her in Bravos a few years ago. As well as many other small gashes from small battles and fights over the years. One thing Gendry\u2019s body held that Arya\u2019s didn\u2019t was burns. He told her a story of him getting burnt by the scalding hot flames in Tobho Mott\u2019s forge while they traveled together before they parted ways. </p><p>Arya sauntered to the back of the forge where Gendry\u2019s own hearth stood apart from the rest. It was separated by a thick stone wall and a massive wooden door. Arya used to struggle to open it when she was younger because of how heavy the wood was. It was a blessing that she could open it on her own now. </p><p>Gendry always worked later than the other blacksmiths. It was nearing dark and it was almost time for supper; many of the other men had already retired for the evening. She always chuckled to herself when she walked into his room and saw him still slaving away over the hearth, his sweat dripping from his brow onto the hot coals. She would watch it drip as she sat on his bed in the far corner. Arya laid there for minutes before her friend set down his hammer and turned toward her. He removed his sweat-soaked apron and hung it in the corner by the small window. Arya watched the muscles in his back move as he stretched his arms above his head, looking to relieve some tension he held in his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here late today.\u201d Gendry said as he sat down next to her on the featherbed. He picked her feet up and rested them back down on the tops of his thighs. \u201cDid Sansa keep you longer today?\u201d</p><p>Arya nodded her head and groaned. \u201cShe kept going on about expenses and making sure we managed the crops well so we can last through the rest of this long winter. It doesn\u2019t matter much anyway, I knew you would work up until supper. That\u2019s why I stole some food from the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>Arya grabbed the bag she was carrying earlier and set it on the bed next to her. Gendry reached in and pulled out some bread, jerky, and a flask of winter wine. \u201cThis is all you brought? I can eat this all myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want something else you can go sneak it from the kitchens yourself. Hot Pie doesn\u2019t appreciate when you steal the food he makes.\u201d Arya retorted. Her wrists knew just how he felt when he caught her sneaking some food. She was surprised her wrists weren\u2019t broken from her friend smacking them with his wooden spoon.</p><p>\u201cFine. I will!\u201d Gendry got up and disappeared, Arya wondered what was making him act so stubborn and short lately. She wished she could corner him and ask him about his attitude. Suddenly it was as if the Gods heard her prayers because Gendry yelled from the front of the forge. \u201cUh, Arya! The door won\u2019t budge\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid Bull, what do you mean it won\u2019t-\u201d Arya stopped her verbal attack when she looked out Gendry\u2019s small window. The snow was piled up to the base of the glass. The snowfall must have picked up since she came inside. It was coming down hard when she walked across the courtyard, but now it was blizarding so badly that you couldn\u2019t see more than a foot in front of yourself. </p><p>Gendry stalked back into his quarters, shut the door, and flopped on to his bed. Arya wondered to herself why he shut the heavy door, but when the heat started to get trapped inside the small room she understood. If he hadn\u2019t of shut the door there was a chance that they would lose all the heat, she just hoped they could keep the hearth going all night. If they couldn\u2019t there was a chance they could freeze to death in their sleep. </p><p>Arya went and sat next to him, picking his head up to rest it on her thigh. Gendry sighed and looked up at her. \u201cDo you want to tell me why you\u2019ve been acting so strange lately?\u201d </p><p>Gendry seemed to tense immediately, but Arya ignored it and grabbed a piece of jerky. As she ate she could practically feel the gears grinding in Gendry\u2019s head as he struggled with whatever was on his mind. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk at least eat something.\u201d she shoved a slice of jerky into his hand and took a sip from the wine flask. </p><p>They ate in silence until the outside light drained from the room and the only source of light they had left was the dim fire growing from the hearth. Gendry sat up and went to the small closet in the corner of the room and grabbed a heavy fur throw. Arya kicked off her shoes and crawled under the covers after removing her fur cloak. She set it on top of the thin woolen blanket before Gendry covered the feather bed in the thick fur of his throw. Arya pulled the covers aside and shifted so Gendry had enough room to crawl under the covers. Gendry stood and looked at her like she was crazed. </p><p>\u201cOh curse the Gods.\u201d Arya said as she sat up. \u201cGendry will you get into bed you\u2019ll freeze to death. I don\u2019t know why you haven\u2019t been acting yourself around me lately, but you need to get over your inner conflict. You\u2019re making me think I\u2019ve done something to spite you.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at her hands in disappointment. Gendry ushered himself forward quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve done Arya.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then spit it out already!\u201d The younger girl snapped at him. Hells that was part of the problem wasn\u2019t it. Gendry knew she hadn\u2019t been a child for quite some time now. She was a woman grown and had been for years. Maybe him knowing was what made him feel so guilty. He shouldn\u2019t be looking at her like a woman grown, he should be looking at her like a princess, someone he should never be speaking to. Maybe that was why the whole situation was so messed up. He was flabbergasted when Jon approached him the other day and asked to speak to him. Ever since they defeated the Night King the pair had become good friends and held a mutual respect for one another, but he never thought Jon saw him as anything more than Robert\u2019s bastard. When Jon legitimized him the other day he had felt uncomfortable beyond belief, but his inner turmoil hadn\u2019t started until Jon asked if Gendry would consider marrying his sister. At first he thought he was talking about Sansa and Gendry had laughed, but Jon had made it very clear quick enough that he meant Arya. Jon told him that he knew they had been friends growing up and knew they had reconnected once they were reunited. He didn\u2019t want to force his sisters to marry, but they needed to rebuild the realm. Jon told him that he knew Gendry wouldn\u2019t force Arya to change who she was and that he respected her just as much as a true northman. Gendry had been speechless. Jon dismissed hima and told him to think about it; he did make it clear however, that it would be in Gendry\u2019s best interest to marry soon. He was now the Lord of Storm\u2019s End and would need to take a wife. It was the final thing Jon mentioned that had struck Gendry so deep though. It had been Robert\u2019s dying wish to unite their houses, and Gendry was the last chance to honor his wish. He knew his father and Eddard Stark had been the closest of friends and he knew what it would mean to unite their houses, but he didn\u2019t want to force Arya to do anything that wasn\u2019t her. </p><p>\u201cGods Gendry! Will you get under the covers you\u2019re freezing!\u201d Arya demanded and he did as she asked. He was staring at the ceiling when he finally told her the truth.</p><p>\u201cJon legitimized me the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry that\u2019s wonderf-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he asked if I would marry you. He knows you don\u2019t want to marry, but he says we need to rebuild the kingdom. He figures that it would be mutually beneficial because I won\u2019t force you to change or be someone you aren\u2019t meant to be and I will have to take a wife soon. But Arya, I would never force you to do something you wouldn\u2019t want to do. It isn\u2019t right of me, but I don\u2019t want to marry someone I\u2019ve never met either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Arya looked at him and stared. He could see the turmoil boiling in her eyes. \u201cI-I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya, Jon didn\u2019t give me a say in getting legitimized. He thought it was in my best interest, but I never wanted this. The only time I ever wished I could get legitimized was when -\u201d \u00a0Gendry stopped and turned away from her, her gaze feeling too heated.</p><p>\u201cWhen was it Gendry?\u201d Her voice was so soft now, it made him want to reach out to touch her. To run his hand over her soft skin.</p><p>\u201cIt was when I first realized I loved you, but I could never be with you since I was a bastard. It was when I realized I could never truly have what I wanted most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before I could be your family, and now I will be.\u201d Gendry looked at her with wide eyes. \u201cGendry, I\u2019ve known the minute I saw how many people were slain on the battlefield that I would be forced to marry. I couldn\u2019t think of anyone better for me to marry than my best friend. I\u2019m positive that I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time as well. I found myself thinking of you quite often over the years.\u201d</p><p>Gendry did reach out to her then. He had nothing to hold him back anymore. She loved him as he did her. They were to be married soon enough. She pressed her forehead against his own and took in a shallow breath as Gendry pressed his lips gently to hers. He couldn\u2019t help but thank Jon and the long winter for snowing them in the forge as he pulled away and felt her small smile press against the bare skin of his chest.</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h2>Day Ten</h2><p><b>Arya and Gendry get snowed into the forge.</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>There were only a few days remaining before the winter holidays and Arya was getting antsy. This would be the first holiday her remaining family spent together. Jon promised that even he would make the trip north. The last raven said he would be here on the morrow. </p><p>Sansa was excited as well, but she was the one in charge of ruling and running Winterfell, so she did not have enough time to get truly excited. Bran never got excited about much anymore. Arya missed her younger brother\u2019s old behavior that was filled with unending joy and curiosity. Arya only had one person she could still connect with, Gendry. Ever since they were reunited before the war their connection had intensified more than when they were younger. At first Arya was angry at Gendry for leaving her when they were kids, but she knew better than blame him for his previous actions. It was a different time, and they were different people. Hells, she was only a shell of the girl she used to be. Living in Bravos and training under the faceless men had made her lose part of herself. Thankfully, being around her family and friends and made it possible for her to regain some of what she had lost, but her childhood innocence would forever be lost in the free cities. </p><p>Arya was trekking across Winterfell\u2019s courtyard and into the small building that was the castle\u2019s forge. The snow was beginning to fall harshly and gather in large two foot piles around the yard. The groundskeepers was busying themselves with shoveling it into piles on the sides of stone buildings. Most likely praying that the hot springs that flowed through each building\u2019s stone walls would melt the piles of snow. If it piled any higher Arya would be buried up to the waist.</p><p>She approached the forge and listened to the repetitive pounding and clashing of metal on metal. The sounds and the scent mixed in the air and all Arya could think of was Gendry. He had been so happy when Arya showed him the smithy. All the work he had done for the great war had been at Dragon Stone and Castle Black, they had only stopped in Winterfell for a mere few days before continuing even farther north. </p><p>The look that crossed his face when they saw each other for the first time in years is one that Arya will never forget. There was a mixture of sadness and amazement in Gendry\u2019s eyes. It was a very similar look to the one he wore when he lost his bull helm many years ago. Arya always wondered if he would remake one for himself someday; she hoped he would, but maybe she just wanted to relive her happy memories.</p><p>Arya never bothered to knock when she entered the forge. She was used to seeing the men\u2019s bare torsos. They never heard her knock anyway, however, they no longer were shocked at her sudden appearance. She ignored the looks they gave her. She could hear many of them mutter that the forge was no place for a lady, but little did they know she was no lady at all. The only one in the smithy that truly understood her was Gendry. He made her life much more adventurous and joyful since his return. As much as she loved her sister and her brothers, they had all grown so much and into very different people than when they were younger. The only one that was around her for most of her adolescent life was Gendry and his understanding of her upbringing made it easier to tell him stories than the rest of her remaining family. \u00a0</p><p>Arya had to admit that the way she looked at her friend changed over the years. She was with him while she was transitioning into womanhood. She remembered the very moment she realized that how she viewed most men changed. That day at Harrenhall when Gendry was practicing swordplay shirtless was some sort of sexual awakening for her younger self. Thinking back on the memory, Arya started to realize just how sinful the situation had been. Her brother was at war, her sister held captive in King\u2019s Landing, and Arya was ogling her best friend\u2019s chizeled figure. She knew she should feel bad, but she didn\u2019t. Even now she couldn\u2019t stop herself from appreciating how handsome he was. He had only gotten more muscular and handsome in their time apart. War had hardened him more as well and left him scarred, but Arya didn\u2019t mind. Scars littered her body as well. She had a very large and wide scar that the waif had given her in Bravos a few years ago. As well as many other small gashes from small battles and fights over the years. One thing Gendry\u2019s body held that Arya\u2019s didn\u2019t was burns. He told her a story of him getting burnt by the scalding hot flames in Tobho Mott\u2019s forge while they traveled together before they parted ways. </p><p>Arya sauntered to the back of the forge where Gendry\u2019s own hearth stood apart from the rest. It was separated by a thick stone wall and a massive wooden door. Arya used to struggle to open it when she was younger because of how heavy the wood was. It was a blessing that she could open it on her own now. </p><p>Gendry always worked later than the other blacksmiths. It was nearing dark and it was almost time for supper; many of the other men had already retired for the evening. She always chuckled to herself when she walked into his room and saw him still slaving away over the hearth, his sweat dripping from his brow onto the hot coals. She would watch it drip as she sat on his bed in the far corner. Arya laid there for minutes before her friend set down his hammer and turned toward her. He removed his sweat-soaked apron and hung it in the corner by the small window. Arya watched the muscles in his back move as he stretched his arms above his head, looking to relieve some tension he held in his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here late today.\u201d Gendry said as he sat down next to her on the featherbed. He picked her feet up and rested them back down on the tops of his thighs. \u201cDid Sansa keep you longer today?\u201d</p><p>Arya nodded her head and groaned. \u201cShe kept going on about expenses and making sure we managed the crops well so we can last through the rest of this long winter. It doesn\u2019t matter much anyway, I knew you would work up until supper. That\u2019s why I stole some food from the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>Arya grabbed the bag she was carrying earlier and set it on the bed next to her. Gendry reached in and pulled out some bread, jerky, and a flask of winter wine. \u201cThis is all you brought? I can eat this all myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want something else you can go sneak it from the kitchens yourself. Hot Pie doesn\u2019t appreciate when you steal the food he makes.\u201d Arya retorted. Her wrists knew just how he felt when he caught her sneaking some food. She was surprised her wrists weren\u2019t broken from her friend smacking them with his wooden spoon.</p><p>\u201cFine. I will!\u201d Gendry got up and disappeared, Arya wondered what was making him act so stubborn and short lately. She wished she could corner him and ask him about his attitude. Suddenly it was as if the Gods heard her prayers because Gendry yelled from the front of the forge. \u201cUh, Arya! The door won\u2019t budge\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid Bull, what do you mean it won\u2019t-\u201d Arya stopped her verbal attack when she looked out Gendry\u2019s small window. The snow was piled up to the base of the glass. The snowfall must have picked up since she came inside. It was coming down hard when she walked across the courtyard, but now it was blizarding so badly that you couldn\u2019t see more than a foot in front of yourself. </p><p>Gendry stalked back into his quarters, shut the door, and flopped on to his bed. Arya wondered to herself why he shut the heavy door, but when the heat started to get trapped inside the small room she understood. If he hadn\u2019t of shut the door there was a chance that they would lose all the heat, she just hoped they could keep the hearth going all night. If they couldn\u2019t there was a chance they could freeze to death in their sleep. </p><p>Arya went and sat next to him, picking his head up to rest it on her thigh. Gendry sighed and looked up at her. \u201cDo you want to tell me why you\u2019ve been acting so strange lately?\u201d </p><p>Gendry seemed to tense immediately, but Arya ignored it and grabbed a piece of jerky. As she ate she could practically feel the gears grinding in Gendry\u2019s head as he struggled with whatever was on his mind. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk at least eat something.\u201d she shoved a slice of jerky into his hand and took a sip from the wine flask. </p><p>They ate in silence until the outside light drained from the room and the only source of light they had left was the dim fire growing from the hearth. Gendry sat up and went to the small closet in the corner of the room and grabbed a heavy fur throw. Arya kicked off her shoes and crawled under the covers after removing her fur cloak. She set it on top of the thin woolen blanket before Gendry covered the feather bed in the thick fur of his throw. Arya pulled the covers aside and shifted so Gendry had enough room to crawl under the covers. Gendry stood and looked at her like she was crazed. </p><p>\u201cOh curse the Gods.\u201d Arya said as she sat up. \u201cGendry will you get into bed you\u2019ll freeze to death. I don\u2019t know why you haven\u2019t been acting yourself around me lately, but you need to get over your inner conflict. You\u2019re making me think I\u2019ve done something to spite you.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at her hands in disappointment. Gendry ushered himself forward quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve done Arya.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then spit it out already!\u201d The younger girl snapped at him.

Arya watched the muscles in his back move as he stretched his arms above his head, looking to relieve some tension he held in his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here late today.\u201d Gendry said as he sat down next to her on the featherbed. He picked her feet up and rested them back down on the tops of his thighs. \u201cDid Sansa keep you longer today?\u201d</p><p>Arya nodded her head and groaned. \u201cShe kept going on about expenses and making sure we managed the crops well so we can last through the rest of this long winter. It doesn\u2019t matter much anyway, I knew you would work up until supper. That\u2019s why I stole some food from the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>Arya grabbed the bag she was carrying earlier and set it on the bed next to her. Gendry reached in and pulled out some bread, jerky, and a flask of winter wine. \u201cThis is all you brought? I can eat this all myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want something else you can go sneak it from the kitchens yourself. Hot Pie doesn\u2019t appreciate when you steal the food he makes.\u201d Arya retorted. Her wrists knew just how he felt when he caught her sneaking some food. She was surprised her wrists weren\u2019t broken from her friend smacking them with his wooden spoon.</p><p>\u201cFine. I will!\u201d Gendry got up and disappeared, Arya wondered what was making him act so stubborn and short lately. She wished she could corner him and ask him about his attitude. Suddenly it was as if the Gods heard her prayers because Gendry yelled from the front of the forge. \u201cUh, Arya! The door won\u2019t budge\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid Bull, what do you mean it won\u2019t-\u201d Arya stopped her verbal attack when she looked out Gendry\u2019s small window. The snow was piled up to the base of the glass. The snowfall must have picked up since she came inside. It was coming down hard when she walked across the courtyard, but now it was blizarding so badly that you couldn\u2019t see more than a foot in front of yourself. </p><p>Gendry stalked back into his quarters, shut the door, and flopped on to his bed. Arya wondered to herself why he shut the heavy door, but when the heat started to get trapped inside the small room she understood. If he hadn\u2019t of shut the door there was a chance that they would lose all the heat, she just hoped they could keep the hearth going all night. If they couldn\u2019t there was a chance they could freeze to death in their sleep. </p><p>Arya went and sat next to him, picking his head up to rest it on her thigh. Gendry sighed and looked up at her. \u201cDo you want to tell me why you\u2019ve been acting so strange lately?\u201d </p><p>Gendry seemed to tense immediately, but Arya ignored it and grabbed a piece of jerky. As she ate she could practically feel the gears grinding in Gendry\u2019s head as he struggled with whatever was on his mind. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk at least eat something.\u201d she shoved a slice of jerky into his hand and took a sip from the wine flask. </p><p>They ate in silence until the outside light drained from the room and the only source of light they had left was the dim fire growing from the hearth. Gendry sat up and went to the small closet in the corner of the room and grabbed a heavy fur throw. Arya kicked off her shoes and crawled under the covers after removing her fur cloak. She set it on top of the thin woolen blanket before Gendry covered the feather bed in the thick fur of his throw. Arya pulled the covers aside and shifted so Gendry had enough room to crawl under the covers. Gendry stood and looked at her like she was crazed. </p><p>\u201cOh curse the Gods.\u201d Arya said as she sat up. \u201cGendry will you get into bed you\u2019ll freeze to death. I don\u2019t know why you haven\u2019t been acting yourself around me lately, but you need to get over your inner conflict. You\u2019re making me think I\u2019ve done something to spite you.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at her hands in disappointment. Gendry ushered himself forward quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve done Arya.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then spit it out already!\u201d The younger girl snapped at him. Hells that was part of the problem wasn\u2019t it. Gendry knew she hadn\u2019t been a child for quite some time now. She was a woman grown and had been for years. Maybe him knowing was what made him feel so guilty. He shouldn\u2019t be looking at her like a woman grown, he should be looking at her like a princess, someone he should never be speaking to. Maybe that was why the whole situation was so messed up. He was flabbergasted when Jon approached him the other day and asked to speak to him. Ever since they defeated the Night King the pair had become good friends and held a mutual respect for one another, but he never thought Jon saw him as anything more than Robert\u2019s bastard. When Jon legitimized him the other day he had felt uncomfortable beyond belief, but his inner turmoil hadn\u2019t started until Jon asked if Gendry would consider marrying his sister. At first he thought he was talking about Sansa and Gendry had laughed, but Jon had made it very clear quick enough that he meant Arya. Jon told him that he knew they had been friends growing up and knew they had reconnected once they were reunited. He didn\u2019t want to force his sisters to marry, but they needed to rebuild the realm. Jon told him that he knew Gendry wouldn\u2019t force Arya to change who she was and that he respected her just as much as a true northman. Gendry had been speechless. Jon dismissed hima and told him to think about it; he did make it clear however, that it would be in Gendry\u2019s best interest to marry soon. He was now the Lord of Storm\u2019s End and would need to take a wife. It was the final thing Jon mentioned that had struck Gendry so deep though. It had been Robert\u2019s dying wish to unite their houses, and Gendry was the last chance to honor his wish. He knew his father and Eddard Stark had been the closest of friends and he knew what it would mean to unite their houses, but he didn\u2019t want to force Arya to do anything that wasn\u2019t her. </p><p>\u201cGods Gendry! Will you get under the covers you\u2019re freezing!\u201d Arya demanded and he did as she asked. He was staring at the ceiling when he finally told her the truth.</p><p>\u201cJon legitimized me the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry that\u2019s wonderf-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he asked if I would marry you. He knows you don\u2019t want to marry, but he says we need to rebuild the kingdom. He figures that it would be mutually beneficial because I won\u2019t force you to change or be someone you aren\u2019t meant to be and I will have to take a wife soon. But Arya, I would never force you to do something you wouldn\u2019t want to do. It isn\u2019t right of me, but I don\u2019t want to marry someone I\u2019ve never met either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Arya looked at him and stared. He could see the turmoil boiling in her eyes. \u201cI-I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya, Jon didn\u2019t give me a say in getting legitimized. He thought it was in my best interest, but I never wanted this. The only time I ever wished I could get legitimized was when -\u201d \u00a0Gendry stopped and turned away from her, her gaze feeling too heated.</p><p>\u201cWhen was it Gendry?\u201d Her voice was so soft now, it made him want to reach out to touch her. To run his hand over her soft skin.</p><p>\u201cIt was when I first realized I loved you, but I could never be with you since I was a bastard. It was when I realized I could never truly have what I wanted most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before I could be your family, and now I will be.\u201d Gendry looked at her with wide eyes. \u201cGendry, I\u2019ve known the minute I saw how many people were slain on the battlefield that I would be forced to marry. I couldn\u2019t think of anyone better for me to marry than my best friend. I\u2019m positive that I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time as well. I found myself thinking of you quite often over the years.\u201d</p><p>Gendry did reach out to her then. He had nothing to hold him back anymore. She loved him as he did her. They were to be married soon enough. She pressed her forehead against his own and took in a shallow breath as Gendry pressed his lips gently to hers. He couldn\u2019t help but thank Jon and the long winter for snowing them in the forge as he pulled away and felt her small smile press against the bare skin of his chest.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>Day Ten</h2><p><b>Arya and Gendry get snowed into the forge.</b></p><p>There were only a few days remaining before the winter holidays and Arya was getting antsy. This would be the first holiday her remaining family spent together. Jon promised that even he would make the trip north. The last raven said he would be here on the morrow. </p><p>Sansa was excited as well, but she was the one in charge of ruling and running Winterfell, so she did not have enough time to get truly excited. Bran never got excited about much anymore. Arya missed her younger brother&rsquo;s old behavior that was filled with unending joy and curiosity. Arya only had one person she could still connect with, Gendry. Ever since they were reunited before the war their connection had intensified more than when they were younger. At first Arya was angry at Gendry for leaving her when they were kids, but she knew better than blame him for his previous actions. It was a different time, and they were different people. Hells, she was only a shell of the girl she used to be. Living in Bravos and training under the faceless men had made her lose part of herself. Thankfully, being around her family and friends and made it possible for her to regain some of what she had lost, but her childhood innocence would forever be lost in the free cities. </p><p>Arya was trekking across Winterfell&rsquo;s courtyard and into the small building that was the castle&rsquo;s forge. The snow was beginning to fall harshly and gather in large two foot piles around the yard. The groundskeepers was busying themselves with shoveling it into piles on the sides of stone buildings. Most likely praying that the hot springs that flowed through each building&rsquo;s stone walls would melt the piles of snow. If it piled any higher Arya would be buried up to the waist.</p><p>She approached the forge and listened to the repetitive pounding and clashing of metal on metal. The sounds and the scent mixed in the air and all Arya could think of was Gendry. He had been so happy when Arya showed him the smithy. All the work he had done for the great war had been at Dragon Stone and Castle Black, they had only stopped in Winterfell for a mere few days before continuing even farther north. </p><p>The look that crossed his face when they saw each other for the first time in years is one that Arya will never forget. There was a mixture of sadness and amazement in Gendry&rsquo;s eyes. It was a very similar look to the one he wore when he lost his bull helm many years ago. Arya always wondered if he would remake one for himself someday; she hoped he would, but maybe she just wanted to relive her happy memories.</p><p>Arya never bothered to knock when she entered the forge. She was used to seeing the men&rsquo;s bare torsos. They never heard her knock anyway, however, they no longer were shocked at her sudden appearance. She ignored the looks they gave her. She could hear many of them mutter that the forge was no place for a lady, but little did they know she was no lady at all. The only one in the smithy that truly understood her was Gendry. He made her life much more adventurous and joyful since his return. As much as she loved her sister and her brothers, they had all grown so much and into very different people than when they were younger. The only one that was around her for most of her adolescent life was Gendry and his understanding of her upbringing made it easier to tell him stories than the rest of her remaining family. &nbsp;</p><p>Arya had to admit that the way she looked at her friend changed over the years. She was with him while she was transitioning into womanhood. She remembered the very moment she realized that how she viewed most men changed. That day at Harrenhall when Gendry was practicing swordplay shirtless was some sort of sexual awakening for her younger self. Thinking back on the memory, Arya started to realize just how sinful the situation had been. Her brother was at war, her sister held captive in King&rsquo;s Landing, and Arya was ogling her best friend&rsquo;s chizeled figure. She knew she should feel bad, but she didn&rsquo;t. Even now she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from appreciating how handsome he was. He had only gotten more muscular and handsome in their time apart. War had hardened him more as well and left him scarred, but Arya didn&rsquo;t mind. Scars littered her body as well. She had a very large and wide scar that the waif had given her in Bravos a few years ago. As well as many other small gashes from small battles and fights over the years. One thing Gendry&rsquo;s body held that Arya&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t was burns. He told her a story of him getting burnt by the scalding hot flames in Tobho Mott&rsquo;s forge while they traveled together before they parted ways. </p><p>Arya sauntered to the back of the forge where Gendry&rsquo;s own hearth stood apart from the rest. It was separated by a thick stone wall and a massive wooden door. Arya used to struggle to open it when she was younger because of how heavy the wood was. It was a blessing that she could open it on her own now. </p><p>Gendry always worked later than the other blacksmiths. It was nearing dark and it was almost time for supper; many of the other men had already retired for the evening. She always chuckled to herself when she walked into his room and saw him still slaving away over the hearth, his sweat dripping from his brow onto the hot coals. She would watch it drip as she sat on his bed in the far corner. Arya laid there for minutes before her friend set down his hammer and turned toward her. He removed his sweat-soaked apron and hung it in the corner by the small window. Arya watched the muscles in his back move as he stretched his arms above his head, looking to relieve some tension he held in his shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here late today.&rdquo; Gendry said as he sat down next to her on the featherbed. He picked her feet up and rested them back down on the tops of his thighs. &ldquo;Did Sansa keep you longer today?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya nodded her head and groaned. &ldquo;She kept going on about expenses and making sure we managed the crops well so we can last through the rest of this long winter.

Arya\u2019d\u00a0been left to guard Cersei and her son for a time, Casterly Rock, the castle that Jon was already within, searching for his baby sister, her screams driving him, as he felled soldiers who stood in his way, ignored Lannister soldiers that moved out of his way. Only Tommen then stood, a boy hardened by the death of his sister, and for what reason Jon could not yet tell, raised his sword to Jon. Jon did not wish to strike the boy, but he would to get to Arya.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way,\u201d He near snarled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou won't\u00a0have the wolf girl,\u201d Tommen replied, raising his chin high.\u00a0\u201cI promised her nothing would happen.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><hr><p>\u201cJON!\u201d She screeched again, hands fisting in bloodied tunic, crying as wave after wave of pain tore through her.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHe won&rsquo;t help you, girl, you know who he\u2019s sided with,\u201d Cersei Lannister\u2019s words are harsh, but Arya fears they may be true, as she lays in her bed of blood. The former queen had been kind enough to help tend her, but Arya could not tell if she truly cared if she died or not, pain ripping through as she sobbed and sweat, dropping as her eyes rolled back into her head.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBreathe! Before you kill the both of you!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><hr><p>Though Tommen thought he mayhaps had been protecting Jon\u2019s sister, he had kept him from her, even as she screamed for him. The boy had made to stop Jon, and though he was wont to do it, the youngest Lannister\u2019s blood now stained The White Wolf\u2019s sword, barging his way through the halls, hearing the footfalls of The Hound and Tormund behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cArya!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d He barrelled his shoulder through the door, greeted with the sight of Arya, sickly pale, in a bed of blood, and he was quick to her side, sword dropped in his haste. He pushed sweat soaked locks from her face, but she was pushing at him, gripping him by clothes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cPromise me, Jon, Promise me you will protect him!\u201d Jon shakes his head, frowning as he does not understand until the cries of a babe pierce his ears, and he\u2019s turning his head, spying Cersei Lannister, holding clothed but bloody babe within her arms, soothing him.

It was all the same, and yet entirely different.&nbsp;</p><p>He is numb, as he leaves, Arya&rsquo;s final breath still lingering, and Jon leaves Cersei for Jaime Lannister to deal with, but the sight of the babe has The Hound for once, seeming to care.&nbsp;&ldquo;Fucks sake..&rdquo; He says, even as Tormund frowns.&nbsp;</p><p>He wouldn&rsquo;t have his name, but this boy had his blood. Jon would call him his own, and pretend. He&rsquo;d lie to Daenerys, and she would wonder, who Jon loved enough to betray her, but Jon would lie this once. They&rsquo;d not known when Arya left, that she was with child, they would not know now she was gone.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb Snow, Jon Snow&rsquo;s bastard son. Unlike Ned Stark, Jon would someday tell the boy of his mother, but not until it was safe to do so.&nbsp; For he had promised.&nbsp;</p>",

It is no surprise she knows he is coming, he has not been subtle in his approach, even with Jaime Lannister on the other end of Casterly Rock, trying to slow him down, Jon is faster, Tormund and Sandor Clegan&nbsp;following after.</p>\n</p>",

She didn\u2019t know if it was because the temperature in her room was just how she liked it, or if it was due to the time she had spent with Gendry the night before. It was odd hearing about his past. It felt like they were traveling on the King\u2019s Road again. The level of danger was certainly the same as when they were traveling to the wall, different only in technicality. </p><p>The dull winter sun was shining through the frosted window in her bedchamber, dimly lighting the warm stone walls. She moved to add a few more sticks to the hearth in the corner, attempting to make it just a little warmer. Arya heard a faint knock on her door and beckoned for whoever knocked to enter. She was in her shift and a heavy cloak to block the frigid temperatures from crawling up her skin. </p><p>She was surprised to see her sister walk through her door with Lady Brienne in tow. It was late in the morning and Arya was sure her sister had more important matters at hand. Even with Jon returned home, Sansa had continued her duties as Lady of Winterfell. She was naturally good at it. Knowing when to rule and what justice was right. It was something Arya would never match, no matter how hard she tried. After being together for all these years during the Great War, the sisters learned that they were two sides of the same coin, opposite but ever the same. </p><p>\u201cHeavens Arya,\u201d Sansa started, \u201cI thought something was wrong. You never sleep this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surprised myself. I woke expecting it to be early morning, instead half the day had already wasted away.\u201d Arya turned and smiled at Brienne, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed our sparring session this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lady it is no problem. We can fight on the marrow.\u201d Brienne offered kindly and excused herself, moving to stand outside the entryway. Sansa took a step toward her sister and crowded around the fire, adjusting the long sleeves of her warm winter gown.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Arya,\u201d the younger sister turned toward her elder sibling allowing her all of her attention, not sparing a glance as her sister moved toward the door. \u201cNext time, tell Gendry to be a bit more stealthy when he leaves.\u201d</p><p>Arya stood there gawking as her sister closed the door with a smirk. Her fire-red hair the lasting thing Arya saw before the door fully shut. Gendry had been seen by someone upon leaving her chambers. She did not care what all the other lords and ladies thought, but she knew her sister and Jon would not like the crude words that spilled from their lips. She turned and saw a dress laid out for her on her bed. Something her sister had sewn, no doubt. Surprisingly enough it had not been long since Arya had been in a dress. Womanly customs was something Arya had grown more accustom to during her time in Bravos. She grew to like gowns, though she would never admit it. The Bravosi fashion trends lends itself to flowing dresses, often with no underlying structure, unlike the thick fabrics of the north that limit movement. She could easily fight in a silk Bravosi style dress. Arya approached the thick woolen dress slowly and ran her hands across the fabric. It looked similar to the one Sansa was wearing. Dark grey with grey and white fur. Arya put the gown on, sliding a pair of britches on underneath for comfort, or if she needed to fight her bare arse wouldn\u2019t be shown to the world. Her hair was hanging loosely by her shoulders, so she pinned part of it back out of her face and moved to look at herself in the mirror. She looked every bit a lady. Arya knew that if her parents could see her now, they would be proud of the young lady she has become. </p><p>With those thoughts pushed aside, Arya gathered her cloak and needle and made her way outside into the frosty air. She saw Maester Kerwin wheeling Bran into the Godswood and decided that she would go find Gendry in the forge instead of her original plan. As she crossed the yard she took note of how the remaining lords and ladies looked at her. She was no longer the rowdy wolf-girl they remembered from her childhood, but one of the most feared warriors in all of Westeros. She was treated with the respect she deserved, her and her sister both. Between the Dragon Queen, Brienne of Tarth, Meera Reed, and herself they were reshaping the role women played in their society. Gone were the days of subjecting to the whim of every man and lord, or hiding in the castle with your sewing needles. The day had come when women could make their own decisions. They could be warriors, they could man the wall, hells, they could rule the Seven Kingdoms. </p><p>As she approached the forge Arya began to feel uneasy. She knew she had no reason to feel such a way. Nothing had truly changed last night. They were still the same. She was Arya Stark and he was Gendry Waters. Well, he would be Gendry Baratheon soon enough. Would things change then? Or would all remain the same? </p><p>Taking a deep breath she pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside debatably the warmest building in all of Winterfell. She weaved her way through the many working blacksmiths till she got to the back where she knew Gendry would be. Since he first stepped foot in Winterfell before the Great War, Gendry had spent most of his time in the smithy. So much that he had taken over as their resident blacksmith and claimed the head position for himself. Now, much to Jon\u2019s dismay, Gendry lived in the forge in the small bedchamber tucked in the back of the building. Jon thought because Gendry was soon to be legitimized he no longer had to live as a bastard blacksmith, but Gendry was just as content as he always had been. Arya imagined a change in surname would do nothing to change his true character. </p><p>\u201cArry?\u201d Her friend said as he pulled her from her thoughts. His hammering ceasing while he looked upon her. His eyes drifting from her hair down to her toes, not skipping over an inch of her body. \u201cThis is&hellip; different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wear a dress Gendry. It\u2019s not going to kill me, much to the beliefs of my younger self.\u201d Arya said with a grin on her face. She moved to sit on the stool opposite the hearth. Gendry continued to track her with his eyes his hammer now hanging by his side. \u201cSeven hells Gendry! What are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>Gendry had the decency to blush. \u201cYou look like a proper lady is all. I haven\u2019t seen you in a dress in quite some time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you haven\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve worn a gown though.\u201d \u00a0Gendry\u2019s eyes widened as Arya rolled her\u2019s. She prepared to go in depth on her time in the wonderful city of Bravos. \u201cI wore them quite frequently while I was in Bravos. Especially during their holidays. Many women wore gowns of sheer fabric and the best way to fly under their nose while I was training to be a faceless man was to blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me, that you wore sheer flowing dresses, and that you didn\u2019t mind?\u201d Arya nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe sheer fabric was nice in the painful hot temperatures. They weren\u2019t completely sheer. Only the top half, it was mainly to appease the lingering stares of the men.\u201d Gendry looked at her with his mouth hanging open. \u201cI still have one packed away, incase I ever found myself going back to Bravos I would have something to wear. I was never planning on coming north. My plan was to go to King\u2019s Landing and finally kill Cersei. Now look, it turns out that I\u2019ll still get to do what I came here to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Bravos someday.\u201d Gendry said calmly. He set his hammer down and moved to stand in front of her. He sat on the round gently and smiled. \u201cTell me more about how the Bravosi celebrated the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to hear more about the women in their sheer dresses.\u201d Arya said teasingly. Gendry\u2019s skin flushed and he bowed his head, only looking up at her with a coy smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to hear more about Bravosi women and their sheer gowns. I want to hear about you in the sheer gowns.\u201d Arya swore she\u2019d never seen his eyes go that wide before. \u201cThat-that\u2019s not what I meant! I want to hear about you and how you celebrated while you were in Bravos. That\u2019s all, I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.\u201d</p><p>Arya could do nothing but laugh to herself at the way her friend\u2019s face went beet-red at the innuendo of his words. She thought she even saw beads of sweat begin to form on his brow. \u201cIs that so?\u201d Arya said teasingly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>Gendry gulped, but nodded his head. Arya began by telling him the history of the Unmasking. \u201cSince the creation of the city the people of Bravos wanted to remember just how different Bravos was and celebrate not just the city but the Many Faced God. The Unmasking is celebration that lasts ten days and for those ten days each and every person in Bravos is masked. Every day is filled with feasting and debauchery. Every woman is in gowns and every man tailored. No one can tell you status and it is the only time of year where everyone can freely love because there is no societal rules telling them they can\u2019t be with someone else. Then when the tenth day rolls around the titan of Bravos roars and everyone removes their masks together, soaking in the final moments of that year\u2019s freedom. For the citizen of Bravos it is the only time of year where they feel equal to the faceless men and the Many Faced God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like something out of a fairytale.\u201d Gendry said when she finished, \u2018it sounds like what I\u2019d hoped for since we left King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at Gendry and in that moment she knew everything had changed. \u201cSince we left King\u2019s Landing?\u201d Gendry paled and put his head in his hands, realizing what he said. \u201cYou stupid! I told you years ago that I could be your family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never could have been truly, and you know it. Your family would never have approved.\u201d He looked at her with that same look he did while they were traveling with the Brotherhood. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I am making such a big deal about you getting legitimized?\u201d Arya and Gendry\u2019s heads snapped to the new figure in the door. There Jon stood leaning against the wooden frame. \u201cEver since I saw you two rekindling your friendship I knew something else was there. Daenerys was the one that pointed out to me what it was, but once she did I could see it. You two suffered so much together when you were growing up, it was impossible for something not to form. In order to rebuild after the war we are going to need all the help we can get to rebuild every region. Daenerys and I want people we trust wholeheartedly to help us rule the Seven Kingdoms. We would want nothing more than for you two to rule of the Stormlands together.\u201d</p><p>Arya was looking at her brother in shock as was Gendry. Arya was about to say something when Gendry got up and walked out the door. Arya called after him and jumped up to follow him.</p><p>\u201cGendry!\u201d She bellowed as she held the hem of her dress to run after him. As she rounded the corner she watched him stalk into the Godswood. When she finally caught up with him she saw him with his head pressed against a tree. \u201cGods, of all days you made me chase you in a dress?\u201d</p><p>Gendry turned to look at her and pulled at his hair. With each step he took toward her he took two steps back. Arya was getting sick of this game he was playing with himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He finally whispered, lifting his eyes to meet her own. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be forced to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was being forced?\u201d Arya took a step forward, only a foot between her and Gendry now.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t you. You don\u2019t want marry a man and help him run a castle. You want to be a knight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be both?\u201d Gendry looked at her confused. \u201cWhen I was younger I loathed the idea of marrying and ruling a castle and dealing with an incompetent husband mostly because it was what Sansa wanted with all her heart. It never helped that Sansa was instinctively a proper lady and I had to work for it everyday. As I grew older and spent time in Bravos I learned how to be a fighter and all that comes with it. I missed my family most of all, I would have given anything to go back to being forced to act a lady if it meant I got to see my family again. Now that I have them back and I fought in battle, I don\u2019t see much horror in starting a family of my own. You saw all the men and women who died on the battlefield. It is no secret that if the remaining men and women don\u2019t wed and have children the Seven Kingdoms will face the consequences. As a Stark of Winterfell it is no surprise that I will play a large part in rebuilding after all the realm has suffered at the \u00a0hands of the Night King, and now you\u2019re going to be responsible for reviving House Baratheon. Gendry you are all that is left of your house. You\u2019re my best friend and I can\u2019t imagine any other man I would rather marry. I know you\u2019re going to respect me, never take Needle out of my hand, and you will never force anything on me, yourself included. Does the thought of marrying me disgust you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods Arya, no!\u201d Gendry threw his hands up in the air. \u201cThis is all just so much for me, that\u2019s all. A few years ago I was a no-name bastard from King\u2019s Landing on his way to the Wall to take the black. Now here I stand in front of Arya Stark, a lady of one of the most noble houses in the Seven Kingdoms, and I have been propositioned from the King of the North to marry her. I\u2019m expected to take over as head of House Baratheon simply because I have the blood of a man I never met. I don\u2019t know how to run a castle.</p><p>\u201cTrust me Arry. There is nothing more I have ever wanted than to marry you and have you at my side. I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time now, ever since you trusted me enough to reveal your identity while we were on the King\u2019s road. I\u2019m just overwhelmed is all. My life has changed so much in so few years.\u201d</p><p>Arya closed the distance and wrapped her arms around him in a tight embrace. Gendry buried his face in her neck and took a deep breath. Arya pulled away and looked at him, really looked at him, and stood on her toes before pressing her lips to his. Gendry wasted in time in kissing her back. Their lips slanting together perfectly. Arya had to admit she liked the way the rough hair of his beard scraped against her soft skin. When they parted to breathe Arya offered a small smile and whispered, \u201cI think I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time too.\u201d</p>",

She didn\u2019t know if it was because the temperature in her room was just how she liked it, or if it was due to the time she had spent with Gendry the night before. It was odd hearing about his past. It felt like they were traveling on the King\u2019s Road again. The level of danger was certainly the same as when they were traveling to the wall, different only in technicality. </p><p>The dull winter sun was shining through the frosted window in her bedchamber, dimly lighting the warm stone walls. She moved to add a few more sticks to the hearth in the corner, attempting to make it just a little warmer. Arya heard a faint knock on her door and beckoned for whoever knocked to enter. She was in her shift and a heavy cloak to block the frigid temperatures from crawling up her skin. </p><p>She was surprised to see her sister walk through her door with Lady Brienne in tow. It was late in the morning and Arya was sure her sister had more important matters at hand. Even with Jon returned home, Sansa had continued her duties as Lady of Winterfell. She was naturally good at it. Knowing when to rule and what justice was right. It was something Arya would never match, no matter how hard she tried. After being together for all these years during the Great War, the sisters learned that they were two sides of the same coin, opposite but ever the same. </p><p>\u201cHeavens Arya,\u201d Sansa started, \u201cI thought something was wrong. You never sleep this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surprised myself. I woke expecting it to be early morning, instead half the day had already wasted away.\u201d Arya turned and smiled at Brienne, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed our sparring session this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lady it is no problem. We can fight on the marrow.\u201d Brienne offered kindly and excused herself, moving to stand outside the entryway. Sansa took a step toward her sister and crowded around the fire, adjusting the long sleeves of her warm winter gown.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Arya,\u201d the younger sister turned toward her elder sibling allowing her all of her attention, not sparing a glance as her sister moved toward the door. \u201cNext time, tell Gendry to be a bit more stealthy when he leaves.\u201d</p><p>Arya stood there gawking as her sister closed the door with a smirk. Her fire-red hair the lasting thing Arya saw before the door fully shut. Gendry had been seen by someone upon leaving her chambers. She did not care what all the other lords and ladies thought, but she knew her sister and Jon would not like the crude words that spilled from their lips. She turned and saw a dress laid out for her on her bed. Something her sister had sewn, no doubt. Surprisingly enough it had not been long since Arya had been in a dress. Womanly customs was something Arya had grown more accustom to during her time in Bravos. She grew to like gowns, though she would never admit it. The Bravosi fashion trends lends itself to flowing dresses, often with no underlying structure, unlike the thick fabrics of the north that limit movement. She could easily fight in a silk Bravosi style dress. Arya approached the thick woolen dress slowly and ran her hands across the fabric. It looked similar to the one Sansa was wearing. Dark grey with grey and white fur. Arya put the gown on, sliding a pair of britches on underneath for comfort, or if she needed to fight her bare arse wouldn\u2019t be shown to the world. Her hair was hanging loosely by her shoulders, so she pinned part of it back out of her face and moved to look at herself in the mirror. She looked every bit a lady. Arya knew that if her parents could see her now, they would be proud of the young lady she has become. </p><p>With those thoughts pushed aside, Arya gathered her cloak and needle and made her way outside into the frosty air. She saw Maester Kerwin wheeling Bran into the Godswood and decided that she would go find Gendry in the forge instead of her original plan. As she crossed the yard she took note of how the remaining lords and ladies looked at her. She was no longer the rowdy wolf-girl they remembered from her childhood, but one of the most feared warriors in all of Westeros. She was treated with the respect she deserved, her and her sister both. Between the Dragon Queen, Brienne of Tarth, Meera Reed, and herself they were reshaping the role women played in their society. Gone were the days of subjecting to the whim of every man and lord, or hiding in the castle with your sewing needles. The day had come when women could make their own decisions. They could be warriors, they could man the wall, hells, they could rule the Seven Kingdoms. </p><p>As she approached the forge Arya began to feel uneasy. She knew she had no reason to feel such a way. Nothing had truly changed last night. They were still the same. She was Arya Stark and he was Gendry Waters. Well, he would be Gendry Baratheon soon enough. Would things change then? Or would all remain the same? </p><p>Taking a deep breath she pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside debatably the warmest building in all of Winterfell. She weaved her way through the many working blacksmiths till she got to the back where she knew Gendry would be. Since he first stepped foot in Winterfell before the Great War, Gendry had spent most of his time in the smithy. So much that he had taken over as their resident blacksmith and claimed the head position for himself. Now, much to Jon\u2019s dismay, Gendry lived in the forge in the small bedchamber tucked in the back of the building. Jon thought because Gendry was soon to be legitimized he no longer had to live as a bastard blacksmith, but Gendry was just as content as he always had been. Arya imagined a change in surname would do nothing to change his true character. </p><p>\u201cArry?\u201d Her friend said as he pulled her from her thoughts. His hammering ceasing while he looked upon her. His eyes drifting from her hair down to her toes, not skipping over an inch of her body. \u201cThis is\u2026 different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wear a dress Gendry. It\u2019s not going to kill me, much to the beliefs of my younger self.\u201d Arya said with a grin on her face. She moved to sit on the stool opposite the hearth. Gendry continued to track her with his eyes his hammer now hanging by his side. \u201cSeven hells Gendry! What are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>Gendry had the decency to blush. \u201cYou look like a proper lady is all. I haven\u2019t seen you in a dress in quite some time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you haven\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve worn a gown though.\u201d \u00a0Gendry\u2019s eyes widened as Arya rolled her\u2019s. She prepared to go in depth on her time in the wonderful city of Bravos. \u201cI wore them quite frequently while I was in Bravos. Especially during their holidays. Many women wore gowns of sheer fabric and the best way to fly under their nose while I was training to be a faceless man was to blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me, that you wore sheer flowing dresses, and that you didn\u2019t mind?\u201d Arya nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe sheer fabric was nice in the painful hot temperatures. They weren\u2019t completely sheer. Only the top half, it was mainly to appease the lingering stares of the men.\u201d Gendry looked at her with his mouth hanging open. \u201cI still have one packed away, incase I ever found myself going back to Bravos I would have something to wear. I was never planning on coming north. My plan was to go to King\u2019s Landing and finally kill Cersei. Now look, it turns out that I\u2019ll still get to do what I came here to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Bravos someday.\u201d Gendry said calmly. He set his hammer down and moved to stand in front of her. He sat on the round gently and smiled. \u201cTell me more about how the Bravosi celebrated the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to hear more about the women in their sheer dresses.\u201d Arya said teasingly. Gendry\u2019s skin flushed and he bowed his head, only looking up at her with a coy smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to hear more about Bravosi women and their sheer gowns. I want to hear about you in the sheer gowns.\u201d Arya swore she\u2019d never seen his eyes go that wide before. \u201cThat-that\u2019s not what I meant! I want to hear about you and how you celebrated while you were in Bravos. That\u2019s all, I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.\u201d</p><p>Arya could do nothing but laugh to herself at the way her friend\u2019s face went beet-red at the innuendo of his words. She thought she even saw beads of sweat begin to form on his brow. \u201cIs that so?\u201d Arya said teasingly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>Gendry gulped, but nodded his head.

If you haven\u2019t read that one, read it before you continue with this story. <b><a href=\"https://denbeyondthewall.tumblr.com/post/181491599303/day-four-gendry-tells-arya-about-the-holidays-in\">You can find it here</a></b>. </i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Arya woke up feeling more relaxed than she had in years. She didn\u2019t know if it was because the temperature in her room was just how she liked it, or if it was due to the time she had spent with Gendry the night before. It was odd hearing about his past. It felt like they were traveling on the King\u2019s Road again. The level of danger was certainly the same as when they were traveling to the wall, different only in technicality. </p><p>The dull winter sun was shining through the frosted window in her bedchamber, dimly lighting the warm stone walls. She moved to add a few more sticks to the hearth in the corner, attempting to make it just a little warmer. Arya heard a faint knock on her door and beckoned for whoever knocked to enter. She was in her shift and a heavy cloak to block the frigid temperatures from crawling up her skin. </p><p>She was surprised to see her sister walk through her door with Lady Brienne in tow. It was late in the morning and Arya was sure her sister had more important matters at hand. Even with Jon returned home, Sansa had continued her duties as Lady of Winterfell. She was naturally good at it. Knowing when to rule and what justice was right. It was something Arya would never match, no matter how hard she tried. After being together for all these years during the Great War, the sisters learned that they were two sides of the same coin, opposite but ever the same. </p><p>\u201cHeavens Arya,\u201d Sansa started, \u201cI thought something was wrong. You never sleep this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surprised myself. I woke expecting it to be early morning, instead half the day had already wasted away.\u201d Arya turned and smiled at Brienne, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed our sparring session this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lady it is no problem. We can fight on the marrow.\u201d Brienne offered kindly and excused herself, moving to stand outside the entryway. Sansa took a step toward her sister and crowded around the fire, adjusting the long sleeves of her warm winter gown.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Arya,\u201d the younger sister turned toward her elder sibling allowing her all of her attention, not sparing a glance as her sister moved toward the door. \u201cNext time, tell Gendry to be a bit more stealthy when he leaves.\u201d</p><p>Arya stood there gawking as her sister closed the door with a smirk. Her fire-red hair the lasting thing Arya saw before the door fully shut. Gendry had been seen by someone upon leaving her chambers. She did not care what all the other lords and ladies thought, but she knew her sister and Jon would not like the crude words that spilled from their lips. She turned and saw a dress laid out for her on her bed. Something her sister had sewn, no doubt. Surprisingly enough it had not been long since Arya had been in a dress. Womanly customs was something Arya had grown more accustom to during her time in Bravos. She grew to like gowns, though she would never admit it. The Bravosi fashion trends lends itself to flowing dresses, often with no underlying structure, unlike the thick fabrics of the north that limit movement. She could easily fight in a silk Bravosi style dress. Arya approached the thick woolen dress slowly and ran her hands across the fabric. It looked similar to the one Sansa was wearing. Dark grey with grey and white fur. Arya put the gown on, sliding a pair of britches on underneath for comfort, or if she needed to fight her bare arse wouldn\u2019t be shown to the world. Her hair was hanging loosely by her shoulders, so she pinned part of it back out of her face and moved to look at herself in the mirror. She looked every bit a lady. Arya knew that if her parents could see her now, they would be proud of the young lady she has become. </p><p>With those thoughts pushed aside, Arya gathered her cloak and needle and made her way outside into the frosty air. She saw Maester Kerwin wheeling Bran into the Godswood and decided that she would go find Gendry in the forge instead of her original plan. As she crossed the yard she took note of how the remaining lords and ladies looked at her. She was no longer the rowdy wolf-girl they remembered from her childhood, but one of the most feared warriors in all of Westeros. She was treated with the respect she deserved, her and her sister both. Between the Dragon Queen, Brienne of Tarth, Meera Reed, and herself they were reshaping the role women played in their society. Gone were the days of subjecting to the whim of every man and lord, or hiding in the castle with your sewing needles. The day had come when women could make their own decisions. They could be warriors, they could man the wall, hells, they could rule the Seven Kingdoms. </p><p>As she approached the forge Arya began to feel uneasy. She knew she had no reason to feel such a way. Nothing had truly changed last night. They were still the same. She was Arya Stark and he was Gendry Waters. Well, he would be Gendry Baratheon soon enough. Would things change then? Or would all remain the same? </p><p>Taking a deep breath she pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside debatably the warmest building in all of Winterfell. She weaved her way through the many working blacksmiths till she got to the back where she knew Gendry would be. Since he first stepped foot in Winterfell before the Great War, Gendry had spent most of his time in the smithy. So much that he had taken over as their resident blacksmith and claimed the head position for himself. Now, much to Jon\u2019s dismay, Gendry lived in the forge in the small bedchamber tucked in the back of the building. Jon thought because Gendry was soon to be legitimized he no longer had to live as a bastard blacksmith, but Gendry was just as content as he always had been. Arya imagined a change in surname would do nothing to change his true character. </p><p>\u201cArry?\u201d Her friend said as he pulled her from her thoughts. His hammering ceasing while he looked upon her. His eyes drifting from her hair down to her toes, not skipping over an inch of her body. \u201cThis is\u2026 different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wear a dress Gendry. It\u2019s not going to kill me, much to the beliefs of my younger self.\u201d Arya said with a grin on her face. She moved to sit on the stool opposite the hearth. Gendry continued to track her with his eyes his hammer now hanging by his side. \u201cSeven hells Gendry! What are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>Gendry had the decency to blush. \u201cYou look like a proper lady is all. I haven\u2019t seen you in a dress in quite some time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you haven\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve worn a gown though.\u201d \u00a0Gendry\u2019s eyes widened as Arya rolled her\u2019s. She prepared to go in depth on her time in the wonderful city of Bravos. \u201cI wore them quite frequently while I was in Bravos. Especially during their holidays. Many women wore gowns of sheer fabric and the best way to fly under their nose while I was training to be a faceless man was to blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me, that you wore sheer flowing dresses, and that you didn\u2019t mind?\u201d Arya nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe sheer fabric was nice in the painful hot temperatures. They weren\u2019t completely sheer. Only the top half, it was mainly to appease the lingering stares of the men.\u201d Gendry looked at her with his mouth hanging open. \u201cI still have one packed away, incase I ever found myself going back to Bravos I would have something to wear. I was never planning on coming north. My plan was to go to King\u2019s Landing and finally kill Cersei. Now look, it turns out that I\u2019ll still get to do what I came here to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Bravos someday.\u201d Gendry said calmly. He set his hammer down and moved to stand in front of her. He sat on the round gently and smiled. \u201cTell me more about how the Bravosi celebrated the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to hear more about the women in their sheer dresses.\u201d Arya said teasingly. Gendry\u2019s skin flushed and he bowed his head, only looking up at her with a coy smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to hear more about Bravosi women and their sheer gowns. I want to hear about you in the sheer gowns.\u201d Arya swore she\u2019d never seen his eyes go that wide before. \u201cThat-that\u2019s not what I meant! I want to hear about you and how you celebrated while you were in Bravos. That\u2019s all, I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.\u201d</p><p>Arya could do nothing but laugh to herself at the way her friend\u2019s face went beet-red at the innuendo of his words. She thought she even saw beads of sweat begin to form on his brow. \u201cIs that so?\u201d Arya said teasingly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>Gendry gulped, but nodded his head. Arya began by telling him the history of the Unmasking. \u201cSince the creation of the city the people of Bravos wanted to remember just how different Bravos was and celebrate not just the city but the Many Faced God. The Unmasking is celebration that lasts ten days and for those ten days each and every person in Bravos is masked. Every day is filled with feasting and debauchery. Every woman is in gowns and every man tailored. No one can tell you status and it is the only time of year where everyone can freely love because there is no societal rules telling them they can\u2019t be with someone else. Then when the tenth day rolls around the titan of Bravos roars and everyone removes their masks together, soaking in the final moments of that year\u2019s freedom. For the citizen of Bravos it is the only time of year where they feel equal to the faceless men and the Many Faced God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like something out of a fairytale.\u201d Gendry said when she finished, \u2018it sounds like what I\u2019d hoped for since we left King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at Gendry and in that moment she knew everything had changed. \u201cSince we left King\u2019s Landing?\u201d Gendry paled and put his head in his hands, realizing what he said. \u201cYou stupid! I told you years ago that I could be your family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never could have been truly, and you know it. Your family would never have approved.\u201d He looked at her with that same look he did while they were traveling with the Brotherhood. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I am making such a big deal about you getting legitimized?\u201d Arya and Gendry\u2019s heads snapped to the new figure in the door. There Jon stood leaning against the wooden frame. \u201cEver since I saw you two rekindling your friendship I knew something else was there. Daenerys was the one that pointed out to me what it was, but once she did I could see it. You two suffered so much together when you were growing up, it was impossible for something not to form. In order to rebuild after the war we are going to need all the help we can get to rebuild every region. Daenerys and I want people we trust wholeheartedly to help us rule the Seven Kingdoms. We would want nothing more than for you two to rule of the Stormlands together.\u201d</p><p>Arya was looking at her brother in shock as was Gendry. Arya was about to say something when Gendry got up and walked out the door. Arya called after him and jumped up to follow him.</p><p>\u201cGendry!\u201d She bellowed as she held the hem of her dress to run after him. As she rounded the corner she watched him stalk into the Godswood. When she finally caught up with him she saw him with his head pressed against a tree. \u201cGods, of all days you made me chase you in a dress?\u201d</p><p>Gendry turned to look at her and pulled at his hair. With each step he took toward her he took two steps back. Arya was getting sick of this game he was playing with himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He finally whispered, lifting his eyes to meet her own. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be forced to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was being forced?\u201d Arya took a step forward, only a foot between her and Gendry now.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t you. You don\u2019t want marry a man and help him run a castle. You want to be a knight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be both?\u201d Gendry looked at her confused. \u201cWhen I was younger I loathed the idea of marrying and ruling a castle and dealing with an incompetent husband mostly because it was what Sansa wanted with all her heart. It never helped that Sansa was instinctively a proper lady and I had to work for it everyday. As I grew older and spent time in Bravos I learned how to be a fighter and all that comes with it. I missed my family most of all, I would have given anything to go back to being forced to act a lady if it meant I got to see my family again. Now that I have them back and I fought in battle, I don\u2019t see much horror in starting a family of my own. You saw all the men and women who died on the battlefield. It is no secret that if the remaining men and women don\u2019t wed and have children the Seven Kingdoms will face the consequences. As a Stark of Winterfell it is no surprise that I will play a large part in rebuilding after all the realm has suffered at the \u00a0hands of the Night King, and now you\u2019re going to be responsible for reviving House Baratheon. Gendry you are all that is left of your house. You\u2019re my best friend and I can\u2019t imagine any other man I would rather marry. I know you\u2019re going to respect me, never take Needle out of my hand, and you will never force anything on me, yourself included. Does the thought of marrying me disgust you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods Arya, no!\u201d Gendry threw his hands up in the air. \u201cThis is all just so much for me, that\u2019s all. A few years ago I was a no-name bastard from King\u2019s Landing on his way to the Wall to take the black. Now here I stand in front of Arya Stark, a lady of one of the most noble houses in the Seven Kingdoms, and I have been propositioned from the King of the North to marry her. I\u2019m expected to take over as head of House Baratheon simply because I have the blood of a man I never met. I don\u2019t know how to run a castle.</p><p>\u201cTrust me Arry. There is nothing more I have ever wanted than to marry you and have you at my side. I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time now, ever since you trusted me enough to reveal your identity while we were on the King\u2019s road. I\u2019m just overwhelmed is all. My life has changed so much in so few years.\u201d</p><p>Arya closed the distance and wrapped her arms around him in a tight embrace. Gendry buried his face in her neck and took a deep breath. Arya pulled away and looked at him, really looked at him, and stood on her toes before pressing her lips to his. Gendry wasted in time in kissing her back. Their lips slanting together perfectly. Arya had to admit she liked the way the rough hair of his beard scraped against her soft skin. When they parted to breathe Arya offered a small smile and whispered, \u201cI think I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time too.\u201d</p></p>",

A few years ago I was a no-name bastard from King&rsquo;s Landing on his way to the Wall to take the black. Now here I stand in front of Arya Stark, a lady of one of the most noble houses in the Seven Kingdoms, and I have been propositioned from the King of the North to marry her. I&rsquo;m expected to take over as head of House Baratheon simply because I have the blood of a man I never met. I don&rsquo;t know how to run a castle.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me Arry. There is nothing more I have ever wanted than to marry you and have you at my side. I&rsquo;ve loved you for quite some time now, ever since you trusted me enough to reveal your identity while we were on the King&rsquo;s road. I&rsquo;m just overwhelmed is all. My life has changed so much in so few years.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya closed the distance and wrapped her arms around him in a tight embrace. Gendry buried his face in her neck and took a deep breath. Arya pulled away and looked at him, really looked at him, and stood on her toes before pressing her lips to his. Gendry wasted in time in kissing her back. Their lips slanting together perfectly. Arya had to admit she liked the way the rough hair of his beard scraped against her soft skin. When they parted to breathe Arya offered a small smile and whispered, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve loved you for quite some time too.&rdquo;</p></p>",
