I wonder if this is a one arm hug, because if it\u2019s not, the only place where Jon can put his right arm (look at the last frame before the close up on Sansa) would be under her cloak. Also, I saw many gifs that hypothesize some whispered words, but if you notice how Jon\u2019s ear is close to Sansa\u2019s, that\u2019s definitely too forward for his lips to \u201crest\u201d on her ear. Of course these details don\u2019t necessarily mean something, it could simply be the director\u2019s choice for a better effect (and it\u2019s not that easy to shoot the embrace without framing the height difference). At first then I got the impression that there was a zoom in on them but the background remains almost the same, which means that Jon is holding Sansa very tight, cradling her to himself like, \u201cCome here, I\u2019m never letting you go again\u201d&hellip; One last thing: is that Brienne\u2019s giant shoulder beside Sansa\u2019s head? Because if she is already there, maybe she might have carried a message with her&hellip;</p><p>As for the\ninitial part, again the background tells us something:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/27159c05f9b37c79e3131c1d081469c7/tumblr_inline_peqvvt8Gki1vseiju_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>probably Jon\u2019s just\narrived because behind him we can see the ramparts to the left of Winterfell&rsquo;s entrance and so probably Sansa was already waiting, as also confirmed by her position (she has behind her the ramparts in front of the entrance).\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10ea3c0e7be51182b088d0cbff19a100/tumblr_inline_peqvoyIzbE1vseiju_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bafba350adbab4aa5bd0c88d0afb1d35/tumblr_inline_pequgvwFe41vseiju_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>It makes sense because they\u2019re in daylight so someone must have warned them of the party coming.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"288\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce48e498286289a2bf0ef7c434726b66/tumblr_inline_pep6kqljYa1vseiju_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"288\"/></figure><p>I\u2019d like to\nthink that maybe Jon will arrive a little before the others just to have time to properly reunite with his family but if you look to his left there is a wagon with a soldier on it that&rsquo;s difficult was already there because it&rsquo;s near the entrance, which is usually free from obstacles. So I think they will arrive all together, and since D&amp;D love their parallels, maybe we&rsquo;ll have a welcome like this</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/399b066ca1aa60941c82f1b1af429a9b/tumblr_inline_peqr15rCBh1vseiju_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>And to mark a difference, maybe not everyone will be present this time: Bran for exemple is a bit\ntactless these days (I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the first thing out of his mouth were \u201cHello Aegon\u201d) so maybe their first meeting will be in private and he will go straight sucker punching him with the TRUTH. And as much as I&rsquo;d love to see Arya running towards Jon I don\u2019t think her new NO ONE self makes it probable, at least not in front of everyone. So I really think this will be the first hug and since it seems he kind of starts walking, with just a hint of a twirl, Sansa already quite close, I have a wishful thought: Ghost has moved from her to meet and greet Jon (and the more money we know that D&amp;D have asked HBO to spend on more CGI would be very well spent)&hellip; But, much more simply, probably Jon has just dismounted off his horse!</p><p>To conclude, the funny part: I really can\u2019t find the words to describe Jon aiming straight to Sansa\u2019s lips only to change direction at the last moment preferring the safest neck\u2026 I choose not to comment!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d15b2720197191ddfb6e5b4b19ac78a8/tumblr_inline_pep4zd5r1S1vseiju_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>That\u2019s it everyone!</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p>",

Of course these details don\u2019t necessarily mean something, it could simply be the director\u2019s choice for a better effect (and it\u2019s not that easy to shoot the embrace without framing the height difference). At first then I got the impression that there was a zoom in on them but the background remains almost the same, which means that Jon is holding Sansa very tight, cradling her to himself like, \u201cCome here, I\u2019m never letting you go again\u201d\u2026 One last thing: is that Brienne\u2019s giant shoulder beside Sansa\u2019s head?

But as she said them, it seemed right. It seemed true. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 kind. Not at first. And not to everyone. He\u2019s a bit rough around the edges, you know. I don\u2019t even know if I even really like him, not yet!</p><p>\u201cI mean, we only got coffee the once. But it was fun. He\u2019s easy to talk to. And he\u2019s funny. I mean, when we talk, it\u2019s not like it is with guys my age. Like, he teases me. But not in a mean way or like he\u2019s trying to be smarter than me and show off. Just like\u2026 in a nice way. And he is smart! He holds an actual conversation. Asks me about things. About myself. And then he actually listens to my answers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I really even like him, honestly. It would never work. He\u2019s older than me. I\u2019m just a college kid. I\u2019m just a dumb little girl, probably. He doesn\u2019t like me like that, I\u2019m sure. Except he has this nickname for me, and when he says it, it\u2019s so\u2026 I don\u2019t even know. It\u2019s just good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Talisa ran her finger around the edge of her mug, her eyes on Sansa, \u201cit seems to me that you do like him.\u201d</p>",

        "answer": "<p>I\u2019m assuming you mean game of thrones season 8. Well I have some theories. I\u2019ll rank them in order of how certain I am that they will die:</p><p><b>Definitely Going To Kark It</b></p><p>1) Cercei - She\u2019s on everyone\u2019s list. I will eat my hat if she survives this season.</p><p>2) Dany - If you know me, you know I love villain!dany. I just love how left of field it would be to casuals and I feel like having us follow and love a heroine who slowly descends into evil is right up GRRM\u2019s alley. If I am right in this, Dany will definitely die. If I\u2019m wrong and she\u2019s not a villain, I still feel like her chance for dying is pretty high.</p><p>3) Tyrion - This is more of a gut feeling, but I have a theory that Tyrion is going to be executed by Dany. I think this would act as a perfect moral event horizon for her, showing the audience once and for all that she has become a villain. It\u2019s like boiling a frog, the temperature goes up so slowly that the frog doesn\u2019t notice until it\u2019s too late. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m still pretty sure he\u2019s gonna die.</p><p>4) Tormund - Listen, Tormund has been on my Will Die list since he first appeared. If he survives to the end of the show I will be very, very shocked.</p><p>5) Sandor - The Hound is too axe crazy suicidal to live tbh.</p><p>6) Most, if not all, of the misc. villains</p><p>7) Greyworm - Almost a toss up. If he weren\u2019t a soldier.</p><p><b>Toss Ups</b></p><p>8) Varys - I\u2019m not sure about Varys, he\u2019s got a\u00a0\u201che will outlive us all\u201d vibe but he\u2019s also got a\u00a0\u201ccat on its ninth life\u201d vibe. I\u2019m leaning a little more toward cat on its ninth life.</p><p>9) Bran/Arya - See the thing is, I don\u2019t want either of them to die. However I do believe there\u2019s a strong possibility that at least one is going to kark it. Which of them does die is such a complete toss up for me that I had to group them together. If I had to say whilst at gunpoint, I would say Arya. I feel her death would complete her story arc in the same way the Hound\u2019s death would complete his and Cercei\u2019s would complete hers.</p><p>\n\n10) Misc. general characters that I have not mentioned above or below</p><p>12) Davos - I can see him as dying in a last stand sort of thing. He\u2019s already outlived most of the people he cares about, and I\u2019m not sure about whether that makes him more or less likely to die.</p><p>13) Jaime - While him dying would make sense, I feel like he might actually live. Still a toss up.</p><p>14) Gendry - So I think if Arya dies, Gendry will as well. And if she lives, he\u2019ll live. I see them both going off and doing something when all is said and done.</p><p>15) Brienne - Maaaaybe? I\u2019m preeettty sure she\u2019s gonna live.</p><p><b>Gonna Live (Maybe)</b></p><p>16) Sansa - Almost a toss up, but I feel her character arc doesn\u2019t make sense unless she lives on with the lessons life has beaten into her.</p><p>17) Jon - Also almost a toss up, however I have a feeling that he\u2019s gonna end up on the iron throne. Or at least ruling a large portion of westeros. Otherwise I feel like the only point of him being a secret targ is for a surprise!incest reveal with Dany. I suppose you could argue he needs royal blood if he\u2019s gonna be the prince that was promised, but that isn\u2019t confirmed and the starks were kings a while ago so\u00a0\n\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n</p><p>18) Theon - Now I could be wrong here, but I feel like Theon may have actually delved into Earn Your Happy Ending territory. It\u2019s a very small area in GoT, but I think he might have just managed to mumblefuck his way in. Could be wrong.</p><p>18) Sam, Gilly &amp; Junior - I\u2019m pretty sure these guys are fine. In fact I\u2019d say they\u2019re the safest out of everyone. Just another gut feeling.</p>",

If I&rsquo;m wrong, I&rsquo;m still pretty sure he&rsquo;s gonna die.</p><p>4) Tormund - Listen, Tormund has been on my Will Die list since he first appeared. If he survives to the end of the show I will be very, very shocked.</p><p>5) Sandor - The Hound is too axe crazy suicidal to live tbh.</p><p>6) Most, if not all, of the misc. villains</p><p>7) Greyworm - Almost a toss up. If he weren&rsquo;t a soldier.</p><p><b>Toss Ups</b></p><p>8) Varys - I&rsquo;m not sure about Varys, he&rsquo;s got a&nbsp;&ldquo;he will outlive us all&rdquo; vibe but he&rsquo;s also got a&nbsp;&ldquo;cat on its ninth life&rdquo; vibe. I&rsquo;m leaning a little more toward cat on its ninth life.</p><p>9) Bran/Arya - See the thing is, I don&rsquo;t want either of them to die. However I do believe there&rsquo;s a strong possibility that at least one is going to kark it. Which of them does die is such a complete toss up for me that I had to group them together. If I had to say whilst at gunpoint, I would say Arya. I feel her death would complete her story arc in the same way the Hound&rsquo;s death would complete his and Cercei&rsquo;s would complete hers.</p><p>\n\n10) Misc. general characters that I have not mentioned above or below</p><p>12) Davos - I can see him as dying in a last stand sort of thing. He&rsquo;s already outlived most of the people he cares about, and I&rsquo;m not sure about whether that makes him more or less likely to die.</p><p>13) Jaime - While him dying would make sense, I feel like he might actually live. Still a toss up.</p><p>14) Gendry - So I think if Arya dies, Gendry will as well. And if she lives, he&rsquo;ll live. I see them both going off and doing something when all is said and done.</p><p>15) Brienne - Maaaaybe? I&rsquo;m preeettty sure she&rsquo;s gonna live.</p><p><b>Gonna Live (Maybe)</b></p><p>16) Sansa - Almost a toss up, but I feel her character arc doesn&rsquo;t make sense unless she lives on with the lessons life has beaten into her.</p><p>17) Jon - Also almost a toss up, however I have a feeling that he&rsquo;s gonna end up on the iron throne. Or at least ruling a large portion of westeros. Otherwise I feel like the only point of him being a secret targ is for a surprise!incest reveal with Dany. I suppose you could argue he needs royal blood if he&rsquo;s gonna be the prince that was promised, but that isn&rsquo;t confirmed and the starks were kings a while ago so&nbsp;\n\n&macr;\\_(&#12484;)_/&macr;\n\n</p><p>18) Theon - Now I could be wrong here, but I feel like Theon may have actually delved into Earn Your Happy Ending territory. It&rsquo;s a very small area in GoT, but I think he might have just managed to mumblefuck his way in. Could be wrong.</p><p>18) Sam, Gilly &amp; Junior - I&rsquo;m pretty sure these guys are fine. In fact I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re the safest out of everyone. Just another gut feeling.</p>",
