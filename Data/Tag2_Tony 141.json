        "body": "<p><i>Okay, so, I was browsing <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maqCbInNuPgh_7eTo56Ve-Q\">@reioka</a> tumblr and i found the post at Feathuary and I thought it was one of the best things I ever heard, so I started writing something(when I\u2019m already writing a dozen other things. haha I\u2019m not good at time management&hellip;). This is only about 2000 words. <br/></i></p><p><i>I am gonna post every Thursday.</i></p><p><i>This is going to be Tony-centric.</i></p><p><i>Happy Reading :)</i></p><!-- more --><p>When Tony was eleven years old he plucked out his feathers. He got a pair of pliers out of his mom&rsquo;s tool box and used them to mutilate himself in the worst possible way that anyone of his kind could think of to do. He plucked at each feather, gritting his teeth to stop from yelling out and when that didn&rsquo;t work because it hurt so much, he stuffed a towel in his mouth and kept plucking. He did it while his mom was at work, skipping school and sitting in the bath tub so he could clean up the blood more easily.</p><p>He made sure all the feathers and small fluff from them were in the trash bag after and tied it up tight, even going so far as to stuff it in another trash bag. </p><p>Then he walked a block away from the apartments his small family of two lived and threw it in the big trash can behind another apartment complex.</p><p>He made himself a binder, something to keep his wings close to his body, so they wouldn&rsquo;t flutter unnecessarily \u00a0and so nobody would know he had them. </p><p>They had just moved and that day was supposed to be Tony&rsquo;s first day at his new school. People would just think he had a hunch.</p><p>Tony went to bed early and feigned sickness so his mom wouldn&rsquo;t question it and didn&rsquo;t once take his binder off, even when it began to ache so bad he couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p><p>The next day he went to his mom&rsquo;s closet and took out her knit sweaters and wore two of them before heading to school. <br/></p><p>When the teacher introduced him in front of the class, nobody made allusions to thinking he was hiding any wings under the baggy clothes. When there was break and others kids were coming up to him and trying to guess what he was, he let them think he was just a siren, like his mom. </p><p>Nobody would compare his wings to Howard Stark&rsquo;s ever again.</p><p>&hellip;3 years later&hellip;</p><p>Amanda Armstrong was standing in front of the car, blocking her son from getting his things out of the trunk. She had her arms folded and was standing straight, looking down at her fourteen year old son, wearing his usual baggy sweater and rolling his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Moooom&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I am just saying that if you have changed your mind, it&rsquo;s not too late for me to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;MooOOOOooom&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already talked to Andrew and he&rsquo;s agreed that maybe-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda took a deep breath, &ldquo;You are fourteen. I have no idea why I even agreed-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I was bored and going crazy and you love me and want the best for me and you know that this is my dream school.&rdquo;</p><p>Mother and son stared at each other, one in over-protective mode and the other exasperated.</p><p>Then her shoulders slumped down from where they had tensed up and her sigh indicated she knew this was an argument she didn&rsquo;t get to win, &ldquo;I love you so much Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes and said, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah I know.&rdquo; but he still came forward and hugged her tight. Then he mumbled, &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; into her shoulder. <br/></p><p>She hugged him back, holding on as tightly as she dared, arms avoiding the area where she knew he liked to keep his wings bound back. </p><p>&ldquo;Make sure to work them often, if you don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;ll-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He said quickly, and then he backed up and quickly stopped the subject from going further by gesturing to the trunk. &ldquo;Can we open it now and start moving me in?&rdquo; He smiled.</p><p>Amanda tried not to frown, she knew all her son&rsquo;s smiles and this was the fake one that meant he was bothered and trying to hide it form her because he didn&rsquo;t want her fussing or worried over him. <br/></p><p>She let him off, today was bad enough as it was, with her baby moving out of the house.</p><p>She ruffled his hair, smile growing when he laughed and jerked, &ldquo;Mom, come on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move you in then and go meet this roommate of yours.&rdquo; and see whether it was someone she didn&rsquo;t want around her son, if he was&hellip; well, she knew a few people. Or she could ask the person nicely to &lsquo;go away&rsquo;. Being a siren had made her famous in the rock industry, but just because she only had used her gifts for the entertainment of others, didn&rsquo;t mean she didn&rsquo;t know how to use it to protect either. </p><p>She opened the trunk and they began lugging his few boxes up the dorm room he would be sharing with a stranger for his school career. </p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s roommate wasn&rsquo;t there when they were moving him in, and he didn&rsquo;t show up while they were making the second trip either. He must&rsquo;ve been coming tomorrow and Tony commented as such to his mom. She didn&rsquo;t look happy about that and got a look that meant she was thinking of just camping out in the dorm herself and waiting for this mystery roommate to show up so she could screen him. Tony tried to hustle his mom to move faster after that. </p><p>Before she left to go back home though, they went out to eat and pick up a few last minute snacks, because his mom suddenly noticed, again, that her son was way too skinny.</p><p>Then Tony was left alone, in his dorm, with his unpacked boxes around him, in a place where he didn&rsquo;t know a single soul and had no friends. (Not that he had friends back home either, but he had his mother and Andrew there.)</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Tony met his roommate the next day and even though he was the one that had predicted as such, it was still a surprise and quite an unwanted one. Tony had taken his binder off and had cautiously stretched his wings last night and taken the kitchen scissors he had brought with him and clipped the feathers that had grown out far more than he was comfortable with. He had stretched his wings, did the exercises that he was supposed to do so \u00a0his wings still grew properly and didn&rsquo;t cripple him beyond flying. </p><p>Not that he had ever tried to do so. <br/></p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t put the binder back on, had just tucked his wing nubs close in to his back and flopped face first onto the bed he had claimed. So when the door burst open and someone came stumbling in, swearing almost worse than his mother was capable of when angry, but still pretty damn impressive, Tony freaked out.</p><p>He jumped up, fell out of the bed, swore, pulled his blanket off the bed after himself(a big fluffy one that completely engulfed him and satisfied the part of himself that needed to nest that he frequently tried to ignore), and jerked to the spot on the floor where he had left his binder.</p><p>By the time the swearing had stopped, the person who had barged had managed to right himself and right the two boxes that he had been carrying and right himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Dammit Lilah! I said to be careful.&rdquo;</p><p>There was the sound of a girl laughing, trying to get out an apology, but unable to because of the gasping giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;James-I&rsquo;m- oh gawd- that was so-&rdquo; and the rest was lost to incoherent gasping and cackles.</p><p>The guy who had fallen through the door, presumably James, presumably Tony&rsquo;s roommate, presumably someones that was very annoyed right now, dropped the two boxes in his arms down beside the twin bed Tony hadn&rsquo;t taken and shook his hands out.</p><p>James straightened and looked around, Tony saw him take note of the messed up twin bed beside his own claimed one and then the double take when he spotted Tony on the floor wrapped up in his poofy blanket. The other&rsquo;s eyes widened, his head jerked back just the littlest bit. Then a miniature, female version of James walked in, still wiping away tears from her laughing jaunt and holding her stomach. She startled when she spotted the bundle that was Tony, jumping back and bringing her hands up and squeaking and everything. Tony almost laughed himself.</p><p>The three of them stared all each other for a minute, two shocked and one too goddamn shy to initiate contact. Finally, the girl, Lilah, his roommate, James, had called her Lilah, took the two steps that would put her almost up against her brother. She leaned to her right, &ldquo;Psst, James, you have a gremlin as a roommate.&rdquo;</p><p>Which knocked James out of his stupor; he glared at his sister and slapped the back of her head, hard enough to knock her head forehead, but not hard enough to really hurt, Tony could tell. &ldquo;Lilah, manners! don&rsquo;t make me tell Ma on you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ow, James.&rdquo;</p><p>He ignored her and moved around her, hand out to where Tony was still huddled.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, James Rhodes, I&rsquo;m \u00a0guessing you&rsquo;re my roommate for the year, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you.&rdquo; He was smiling widely, welcoming.</p><p>It took Tony a second to move, but he only brought his hand out to shake James hand. <br/></p><p>Then he mumbled, &ldquo;Nice to meet you to. Tony.&rdquo; Then he retreated, hiding his hand back in his blanket and burrowing a little further into it, hiding the bottom half of his face. He pulled his wind nubs just a tad tighter against his back.</p><p>How was he supposed to get his binder on? \u00a0</p><p>After that there was just awkward silence, until James jerked and gestured behind him, &ldquo;This doofus is my baby sister, Lilah.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t mind her, she&rsquo;s temporary.&rdquo; James winked and smirked, obviously enjoying pulling his sister&rsquo;s leg. Who was now pouting and had crossed her arms. <br/></p><p>Tony smiled awkwardly, because he wasn&rsquo;t sure about how to take the friendliness and really stressed about them possibly seeing his wings. Then remembered that they couldn&rsquo;t see it because Tony was emergency nesting in his magically comforting blanket. Andrew had quilted it for him out of bit of his mother&rsquo;s clothes and bits of his own. The man had been his stepdad for two years and had made this blanket for him as soon as he had found out that Tony was going to be attending MIT. When Tony had first opened it he had kept it with him for a week, just wrapped around himself.</p><p>James must have seen the reluctant amusement in his eyes anyway, because he smiled and backed up.</p><p>He took a deep breath, &ldquo;Tony Armstrong. It&rsquo;s nice to meet you.&rdquo; \u00a0It was mumbled and awkward and sort of stuttered, but he managed to get it out. </p><p>Tony had never really been a people person.</p><p>But the guy seemed friendly enough, maybe this would be okay. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lilah!&rdquo; James whipped around and glared at his sister, there was a little bit of a growl to it, Tony guessed they were some sort of were&rsquo;s. Or shifter types, but shifters usually weren&rsquo;t so tied to their extincts.</p><p>Lilah shrugged unrepentant, but did hunch her shoulders a bit in shame. James turned back to Tony, face scrunched in apology, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for my sister, she still speaks without thinking and doesn&rsquo;t care about her rudeness.&rdquo; James looked back to his sister, glaring.</p><p>Lilah looked away, her cheeks red, &ldquo;Sorry. Was just curious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which isn&rsquo;t an excuse for rudeness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right. Sorry Tony, you don&rsquo;t have to answer.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony felt the blush burning his entire face and forced himself to answer, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; oh that was a squeak and obviously meant they knew he was lying. He cleared his throat and tried again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a siren. Thank you for apologizing.&rdquo;</p><p>The shame disappeared and she got excited, James stopped her before she could get started an embarrassing tangent of questions, &ldquo;Lilah go downstairs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p><p>Lilah pouted and glared at her brother a bit before giving Tony a smile and a little wave, then leaving. </p><p>James watched her leave, then spoke, &ldquo;She has no tact, but she&rsquo;s good hearted I promise.&rdquo; he looked at Tony, making sure he understood.</p><p>Tony nodded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>James grimaced, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not, but she&rsquo;ll get better.&rdquo; He scratched his scalp, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re werebears, by the way, just so you know.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded. He was hitting his tolerance for normal human interaction. Only the littlest bit of his eyes were visible now. Tony was so happy he had this blanket. <br/></p><p>James nodded back, then gestured behind him and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just be going to get the rest of my stuff now, gonna leave the door unlocked, 'kay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;'Kay.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as he was gone Tony quickly put on his binder and clothes and very reluctantly spread his quilt on his twin bed and settled down on it.

She had her arms folded and was standing straight, looking down at her fourteen year old son, wearing his usual baggy sweater and rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMoooom\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, I am just saying that if you have changed your mind, it\u2019s not too late for me to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMooOOOOooom\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already talked to Andrew and he\u2019s agreed that maybe-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>Amanda took a deep breath, \u201cYou are fourteen. I have no idea why I even agreed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was bored and going crazy and you love me and want the best for me and you know that this is my dream school.\u201d</p><p>Mother and son stared at each other, one in over-protective mode and the other exasperated.</p><p>Then her shoulders slumped down from where they had tensed up and her sigh indicated she knew this was an argument she didn\u2019t get to win, \u201cI love you so much Tony.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes and said, \u201cYeah, yeah I know.\u201d but he still came forward and hugged her tight. Then he mumbled, \u201cI love you too.\u201d into her shoulder. <br></p><p>She hugged him back, holding on as tightly as she dared, arms avoiding the area where she knew he liked to keep his wings bound back. </p><p>\u201cMake sure to work them often, if you don\u2019t you know you\u2019ll-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said quickly, and then he backed up and quickly stopped the subject from going further by gesturing to the trunk. \u201cCan we open it now and start moving me in?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Amanda tried not to frown, she knew all her son\u2019s smiles and this was the fake one that meant he was bothered and trying to hide it form her because he didn\u2019t want her fussing or worried over him. <br></p><p>She let him off, today was bad enough as it was, with her baby moving out of the house.</p><p>She ruffled his hair, smile growing when he laughed and jerked, \u201cMom, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move you in then and go meet this roommate of yours.\u201d and see whether it was someone she didn\u2019t want around her son, if he was\u2026 well, she knew a few people. Or she could ask the person nicely to \u2018go away\u2019. Being a siren had made her famous in the rock industry, but just because she only had used her gifts for the entertainment of others, didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t know how to use it to protect either. </p><p>She opened the trunk and they began lugging his few boxes up the dorm room he would be sharing with a stranger for his school career. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>Tony\u2019s roommate wasn\u2019t there when they were moving him in, and he didn\u2019t show up while they were making the second trip either. He must\u2019ve been coming tomorrow and Tony commented as such to his mom. She didn\u2019t look happy about that and got a look that meant she was thinking of just camping out in the dorm herself and waiting for this mystery roommate to show up so she could screen him. Tony tried to hustle his mom to move faster after that. </p><p>Before she left to go back home though, they went out to eat and pick up a few last minute snacks, because his mom suddenly noticed, again, that her son was way too skinny.</p><p>Then Tony was left alone, in his dorm, with his unpacked boxes around him, in a place where he didn\u2019t know a single soul and had no friends. (Not that he had friends back home either, but he had his mother and Andrew there.)</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Tony met his roommate the next day and even though he was the one that had predicted as such, it was still a surprise and quite an unwanted one. Tony had taken his binder off and had cautiously stretched his wings last night and taken the kitchen scissors he had brought with him and clipped the feathers that had grown out far more than he was comfortable with. He had stretched his wings, did the exercises that he was supposed to do so \u00a0his wings still grew properly and didn\u2019t cripple him beyond flying. </p><p>Not that he had ever tried to do so. <br></p><p>He hadn\u2019t put the binder back on, had just tucked his wing nubs close in to his back and flopped face first onto the bed he had claimed. So when the door burst open and someone came stumbling in, swearing almost worse than his mother was capable of when angry, but still pretty damn impressive, Tony freaked out.</p><p>He jumped up, fell out of the bed, swore, pulled his blanket off the bed after himself(a big fluffy one that completely engulfed him and satisfied the part of himself that needed to nest that he frequently tried to ignore), and jerked to the spot on the floor where he had left his binder.</p><p>By the time the swearing had stopped, the person who had barged had managed to right himself and right the two boxes that he had been carrying and right himself. </p><p>\u201cDammit Lilah! I said to be careful.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of a girl laughing, trying to get out an apology, but unable to because of the gasping giggles.</p><p>\u201cJames-I\u2019m- oh gawd- that was so-\u201d and the rest was lost to incoherent gasping and cackles.</p><p>The guy who had fallen through the door, presumably James, presumably Tony\u2019s roommate, presumably someones that was very annoyed right now, dropped the two boxes in his arms down beside the twin bed Tony hadn\u2019t taken and shook his hands out.</p><p>James straightened and looked around, Tony saw him take note of the messed up twin bed beside his own claimed one and then the double take when he spotted Tony on the floor wrapped up in his poofy blanket. The other\u2019s eyes widened, his head jerked back just the littlest bit. Then a miniature, female version of James walked in, still wiping away tears from her laughing jaunt and holding her stomach.

Then he mumbled, \u201cI love you too.\u201d into her shoulder. <br></p><p>She hugged him back, holding on as tightly as she dared, arms avoiding the area where she knew he liked to keep his wings bound back. </p><p>\u201cMake sure to work them often, if you don\u2019t you know you\u2019ll-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said quickly, and then he backed up and quickly stopped the subject from going further by gesturing to the trunk. \u201cCan we open it now and start moving me in?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Amanda tried not to frown, she knew all her son\u2019s smiles and this was the fake one that meant he was bothered and trying to hide it form her because he didn\u2019t want her fussing or worried over him. <br></p><p>She let him off, today was bad enough as it was, with her baby moving out of the house.</p><p>She ruffled his hair, smile growing when he laughed and jerked, \u201cMom, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move you in then and go meet this roommate of yours.\u201d and see whether it was someone she didn\u2019t want around her son, if he was\u2026 well, she knew a few people. Or she could ask the person nicely to \u2018go away\u2019. Being a siren had made her famous in the rock industry, but just because she only had used her gifts for the entertainment of others, didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t know how to use it to protect either. </p><p>She opened the trunk and they began lugging his few boxes up the dorm room he would be sharing with a stranger for his school career. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>Tony\u2019s roommate wasn\u2019t there when they were moving him in, and he didn\u2019t show up while they were making the second trip either. He must\u2019ve been coming tomorrow and Tony commented as such to his mom. She didn\u2019t look happy about that and got a look that meant she was thinking of just camping out in the dorm herself and waiting for this mystery roommate to show up so she could screen him. Tony tried to hustle his mom to move faster after that. </p><p>Before she left to go back home though, they went out to eat and pick up a few last minute snacks, because his mom suddenly noticed, again, that her son was way too skinny.</p><p>Then Tony was left alone, in his dorm, with his unpacked boxes around him, in a place where he didn\u2019t know a single soul and had no friends. (Not that he had friends back home either, but he had his mother and Andrew there.)</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Tony met his roommate the next day and even though he was the one that had predicted as such, it was still a surprise and quite an unwanted one. Tony had taken his binder off and had cautiously stretched his wings last night and taken the kitchen scissors he had brought with him and clipped the feathers that had grown out far more than he was comfortable with. He had stretched his wings, did the exercises that he was supposed to do so \u00a0his wings still grew properly and didn\u2019t cripple him beyond flying. </p><p>Not that he had ever tried to do so. <br></p><p>He hadn\u2019t put the binder back on, had just tucked his wing nubs close in to his back and flopped face first onto the bed he had claimed. So when the door burst open and someone came stumbling in, swearing almost worse than his mother was capable of when angry, but still pretty damn impressive, Tony freaked out.</p><p>He jumped up, fell out of the bed, swore, pulled his blanket off the bed after himself(a big fluffy one that completely engulfed him and satisfied the part of himself that needed to nest that he frequently tried to ignore), and jerked to the spot on the floor where he had left his binder.</p><p>By the time the swearing had stopped, the person who had barged had managed to right himself and right the two boxes that he had been carrying and right himself. </p><p>\u201cDammit Lilah! I said to be careful.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of a girl laughing, trying to get out an apology, but unable to because of the gasping giggles.</p><p>\u201cJames-I\u2019m- oh gawd- that was so-\u201d and the rest was lost to incoherent gasping and cackles.</p><p>The guy who had fallen through the door, presumably James, presumably Tony\u2019s roommate, presumably someones that was very annoyed right now, dropped the two boxes in his arms down beside the twin bed Tony hadn\u2019t taken and shook his hands out.</p><p>James straightened and looked around, Tony saw him take note of the messed up twin bed beside his own claimed one and then the double take when he spotted Tony on the floor wrapped up in his poofy blanket. The other\u2019s eyes widened, his head jerked back just the littlest bit. Then a miniature, female version of James walked in, still wiping away tears from her laughing jaunt and holding her stomach. She startled when she spotted the bundle that was Tony, jumping back and bringing her hands up and squeaking and everything. Tony almost laughed himself.</p><p>The three of them stared all each other for a minute, two shocked and one too goddamn shy to initiate contact. Finally, the girl, Lilah, his roommate, James, had called her Lilah, took the two steps that would put her almost up against her brother. She leaned to her right, \u201cPsst, James, you have a gremlin as a roommate.\u201d</p><p>Which knocked James out of his stupor; he glared at his sister and slapped the back of her head, hard enough to knock her head forehead, but not hard enough to really hurt, Tony could tell. \u201cLilah, manners! don\u2019t make me tell Ma on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw, James.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and moved around her, hand out to where Tony was still huddled.</p><p>\u201cHello, James Rhodes, I\u2019m \u00a0guessing you\u2019re my roommate for the year, it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d He was smiling widely, welcoming.</p><p>It took Tony a second to move, but he only brought his hand out to shake James hand. <br></p><p>Then he mumbled, \u201cNice to meet you to. Tony.\u201d Then he retreated, hiding his hand back in his blanket and burrowing a little further into it, hiding the bottom half of his face. He pulled his wind nubs just a tad tighter against his back.</p><p>How was he supposed to get his binder on? \u00a0</p><p>After that there was just awkward silence, until James jerked and gestured behind him, \u201cThis doofus is my baby sister, Lilah.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t mind her, she\u2019s temporary.\u201d James winked and smirked, obviously enjoying pulling his sister\u2019s leg. Who was now pouting and had crossed her arms. <br></p><p>Tony smiled awkwardly, because he wasn\u2019t sure about how to take the friendliness and really stressed about them possibly seeing his wings. Then remembered that they couldn\u2019t see it because Tony was emergency nesting in his magically comforting blanket. Andrew had quilted it for him out of bit of his mother\u2019s clothes and bits of his own. The man had been his stepdad for two years and had made this blanket for him as soon as he had found out that Tony was going to be attending MIT. When Tony had first opened it he had kept it with him for a week, just wrapped around himself.</p><p>James must have seen the reluctant amusement in his eyes anyway, because he smiled and backed up.</p><p>He took a deep breath, \u201cTony Armstrong. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d \u00a0It was mumbled and awkward and sort of stuttered, but he managed to get it out. </p><p>Tony had never really been a people person.</p><p>But the guy seemed friendly enough, maybe this would be okay. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilah!\u201d James whipped around and glared at his sister, there was a little bit of a growl to it, Tony guessed they were some sort of were\u2019s. Or shifter types, but shifters usually weren\u2019t so tied to their extincts.</p><p>Lilah shrugged unrepentant, but did hunch her shoulders a bit in shame. James turned back to Tony, face scrunched in apology, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my sister, she still speaks without thinking and doesn\u2019t care about her rudeness.\u201d James looked back to his sister, glaring.</p><p>Lilah looked away, her cheeks red, \u201cSorry. Was just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich isn\u2019t an excuse for rudeness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry Tony, you don\u2019t have to answer.\u201d</p><p>Tony felt the blush burning his entire face and forced himself to answer, \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d oh that was a squeak and obviously meant they knew he was lying. He cleared his throat and tried again, \u201cI\u2019m a siren. Thank you for apologizing.\u201d</p><p>The shame disappeared and she got excited, James stopped her before she could get started an embarrassing tangent of questions, \u201cLilah go downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Lilah pouted and glared at her brother a bit before giving Tony a smile and a little wave, then leaving. </p><p>James watched her leave, then spoke, \u201cShe has no tact, but she\u2019s good hearted I promise.\u201d he looked at Tony, making sure he understood.</p><p>Tony nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>James grimaced, \u201cIt\u2019s really not, but she\u2019ll get better.\u201d He scratched his scalp, \u201cWe\u2019re werebears, by the way, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded. He was hitting his tolerance for normal human interaction. Only the littlest bit of his eyes were visible now. Tony was so happy he had this blanket. <br></p><p>James nodded back, then gestured behind him and said, \u201cI\u2019ll just be going to get the rest of my stuff now, gonna leave the door unlocked, 'kay?\u201d</p><p>\u201c'Kay.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he was gone Tony quickly put on his binder and clothes and very reluctantly spread his quilt on his twin bed and settled down on it. He still wanted to hide in it. This was going to be difficult.</p><p>\u2026</p>",

This is only about 2000 words. <br /></i></p><p><i>I am gonna post every Thursday.</i></p><p><i>This is going to be Tony-centric.</i></p><p><i>Happy Reading :)</i></p><p>When Tony was eleven years old he plucked out his feathers. He got a pair of pliers out of his mom&rsquo;s tool box and used them to mutilate himself in the worst possible way that anyone of his kind could think of to do. He plucked at each feather, gritting his teeth to stop from yelling out and when that didn&rsquo;t work because it hurt so much, he stuffed a towel in his mouth and kept plucking. He did it while his mom was at work, skipping school and sitting in the bath tub so he could clean up the blood more easily.</p><p>He made sure all the feathers and small fluff from them were in the trash bag after and tied it up tight, even going so far as to stuff it in another trash bag. </p><p>Then he walked a block away from the apartments his small family of two lived and threw it in the big trash can behind another apartment complex.</p><p>He made himself a binder, something to keep his wings close to his body, so they wouldn&rsquo;t flutter unnecessarily &nbsp;and so nobody would know he had them. </p><p>They had just moved and that day was supposed to be Tony&rsquo;s first day at his new school. People would just think he had a hunch.</p><p>Tony went to bed early and feigned sickness so his mom wouldn&rsquo;t question it and didn&rsquo;t once take his binder off, even when it began to ache so bad he couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p><p>The next day he went to his mom&rsquo;s closet and took out her knit sweaters and wore two of them before heading to school. <br /></p><p>When the teacher introduced him in front of the class, nobody made allusions to thinking he was hiding any wings under the baggy clothes. When there was break and others kids were coming up to him and trying to guess what he was, he let them think he was just a siren, like his mom. </p><p>Nobody would compare his wings to Howard Stark&rsquo;s ever again.</p><p>&hellip;3 years later&hellip;</p><p>Amanda Armstrong was standing in front of the car, blocking her son from getting his things out of the trunk.

No matter how hard he tried, there would always be a day were he felt broken and useless. Where the darkness would cloud his mind so much that he couldn\u2019t breakthrough it all to see his sunshine, to see you. </p><!-- more --><p>Today was one of those days. The pressures of the world started to weigh so heavily on him, he couldn\u2019t move from them. He felt so alone like he had to tackle the world by himself, like he had no one to help shoulder the weight. It was so much for him to bear that he would forget he had you to help shoulder the weight because he only felt the loneliness. </p><p>You\u2019d found him in the lab in the middle of the night, hunched over his new project trying to distract his mind. Not that it was working. His hand reached out and grabbed the day old coffee he\u2019d left, not that he noticed the stale, bitter taste or the coldness of it.</p><p> His hands shook furiously as he tinkered with the wires of and older mark suit. He yelled out when the wire moved differently then he intended, sending sparks flying through the air. Then the part of the suit he been working on did the same, flying across the room to crash into the wall with a loud clang. The sound made him flinch and bury his head into his hands. </p><p><i>I never meant to cry, started losing hope<br/>But somehow baby, you broke through and saved me<br/>You&rsquo;re an angel, tell me you&rsquo;re never leaving</i></p><p>You placed a hand on the small of his back, schooling the hurt on your face when he flinched away from your touch. You knew it wasn\u2019t about you, you knew it was the thoughts than pounded against his skull. They were telling him he wasn\u2019t worth it, he didn\u2019t deserve the touch, that he had to stay in the darkness because he wasn\u2019t worth the sun. </p><p>Still, you kept your hand in place until he could pull himself out of the thoughts in his head. You\u2019d learned early on that you couldn\u2019t do the work for him, you could be his support but he had to pull himself out. It wasn\u2019t easy to stand by and watch but you knew it\u2019s what needed to happen. </p><p>The minutes ticked by ever so slowly, waiting for him to conquer his aggressive thoughts and come back to you but when the coldness of his fingers wrapped around your free hand you knew he had come back to you. Like a switch had been flipped, he now longed for your touch. He pulled you into himself and buried his face into your chest. His hand that gripped onto your own never left, only moving it to his chest. You ran your fingers through his hair, scratching the base of his neck and repeated the action for several minutes. </p><p><i>&lsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re the first thing I know I can believe in</i></p><p>The two of you were in the kitchen now. You knew it\u2019d been a while since he last ate, he always forgot about food when he felt like this. If he didn\u2019t deserve you, or anything else why would he deserve to eat. Beyond that, it would mean he wouldn\u2019t be doing enough to distract his mind and he couldn\u2019t afford that. The thoughts were already too intrusive when he was distracted. </p><p>He was starting to come back to himself. Your light starting to shine through what he thought was impenetrable darkness. He hadn\u2019t let go of your hand, still holding onto you as if you were just a figment of his imagination, a mirage created by his mind to trick him, to taunt him. It wasn\u2019t enough, he needed more. He needed the feel of your skin connecting with his, the spark he felt every time. Every time he touched your smooth skin, or brushed his lips against your perfect ones. </p><p><i>You made the brightest days from the darkest nights<br/>You&rsquo;re the river bank where I was baptized<br/>Cleanse all the demons<br/>That were killing my freedom</i></p><p>You could see it in his eyes that he needed just a little more. He never was good at hiding his emotions, they showed clear as day in his beautiful brown eyes. They looked like chocolate to you, conveying the sweet and soft demeanor only few knew from him. He always laughed when you told him that, he didn\u2019t really like you thinking he was soft. But you couldn\u2019t help it, you had him wrapped around your finger, he would do anything for you. To see your eyes light up like the fireworks on a fourth of July night, or your smile beam at him like he was looking directly into the sun on a spring day. </p><p>Maybe he was soft.</p><p>He heard your sweet, melodic voice ring out into the air. He didn\u2019t catch what you said, his mind still beating on him but it was less now. He only felt the dull reminder of the words and his head didn\u2019t hurt as bad as it did earlier. He felt your soft fingers trail over his skin. Over his shoulders and down his back, the soft fabric of his shirt hindering your fingers from touching his skin. All he wanted to do was rip of the shirt so your skin could touch his. </p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t need the stars 'cause you shine for me</i></p><p><i>Like fire in my veins, you&rsquo;re my ecstasy</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re my ecstasy</i></p><p>Your arms snaked underneath his, your fingers never left his skin. He could feel the heat from the trail of fire your fingers left on his skin. It was heavenly. He loved it, he loved you. He sighed deeply and let his head fall down onto your shoulder and tucked his nose into the crook of your neck. You smelled nice, like evening spent by the fire in a cabin by the woods. He loved it, it smelled like you and you were home to him. </p><p>You placed soft kisses to the exposed skin you could reach. Each one accompanied by a loving sigh from him, the hot breath fanning over your skin. This was more him, and even better it was softest version of him. Music began to flow through the speakers, soft beats leading you to sway with him in your arms. It was his favorite song. The one that had been playing over the speakers at the restaurant he\u2019d rented out on your first date. It was the song he sang to you on the rare nights you couldn\u2019t sleep or on the days were you just wanted to break down. </p><p><i>You&rsquo;re holy, holy, holy, holy</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m high on loving you, high on loving you</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re holy, holy, holy, holy</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m high on loving you, high on loving you</i></p><p>It was the way he\u2019d adopted saying I love you. \u201cI\u2019m high on loving you.\u201d He\u2019d say, a goofy grin on his lips before he kissed you. </p><p>You held him, supporting him as you swayed. He loved that you did that, both figuratively and literally. You held him up in the darkest of times, showed him that even when it was dark and it seemed never ending you would always be there to show him that there was a light, he just had to come back to it. </p><p>The ache in his head had subsided. Now he could hear the soft beats of the music and your soft humming. He smiled against your skin before he kissed it. Of course you played this song. It was your song, the song you listened to when he was away, when you wanted to hear him sing. He detached his fingers from yours and slid them up your arms. The callouses that lined his fingers and palms left tingles on your skin and you savored the feeling. \u00a0</p><p>He trailed kisses up your neck, drinking in the sighs from each one. He kissed along your jawline and up to your lips, where you were still smiling. He loved that smile. He never told you about how he\u2019d kept a picture of you smiling, just like you were now, in his suit. He kept one everywhere, in his wallet, on the background of his phone, on every surface he could put a picture frame. Because if he could see you and be with you, even if it wasn\u2019t physically, he was the luckiest man alive. </p><p>His forehead rested against your own, his hands lazily gripping your neck. His thumbs stroked along your jaw where he\u2019d been trailing kisses. You leaned into his touch, happy to have your Tony back. He smiled at you, the first one you\u2019d been able to see all night. It sent your heart soaring to see, your Tony, your big, soft teddy bear was in your arms dancing away in the kitchen. His gruff voice sounded out over the music singing the words as if he had wrote them himself, just for you. </p><p><i>You&rsquo;re the healing hands where it used to hurt<br/>You&rsquo;re my saving grace, you&rsquo;re my kind of church<br/>You&rsquo;re holy</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b0e3266e5fc0fc97d9fabbb3ce0a04b/tumblr_inline_pmktnniTiV1ticqtz_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><h2><i>If you liked this, let me know!

It wasn\u2019t enough, he needed more. He needed the feel of your skin connecting with his, the spark he felt every time. Every time he touched your smooth skin, or brushed his lips against your perfect ones. </p><p><i>You made the brightest days from the darkest nights<br>You\u2019re the river bank where I was baptized<br>Cleanse all the demons<br>That were killing my freedom</i></p><p>You could see it in his eyes that he needed just a little more. He never was good at hiding his emotions, they showed clear as day in his beautiful brown eyes. They looked like chocolate to you, conveying the sweet and soft demeanor only few knew from him. He always laughed when you told him that, he didn\u2019t really like you thinking he was soft. But you couldn\u2019t help it, you had him wrapped around your finger, he would do anything for you. To see your eyes light up like the fireworks on a fourth of July night, or your smile beam at him like he was looking directly into the sun on a spring day. </p><p>Maybe he was soft.</p><p>He heard your sweet, melodic voice ring out into the air. He didn\u2019t catch what you said, his mind still beating on him but it was less now. He only felt the dull reminder of the words and his head didn\u2019t hurt as bad as it did earlier. He felt your soft fingers trail over his skin. Over his shoulders and down his back, the soft fabric of his shirt hindering your fingers from touching his skin. All he wanted to do was rip of the shirt so your skin could touch his. </p><p><i>I don\u2019t need the stars 'cause you shine for me</i></p><p><i>Like fire in my veins, you\u2019re my ecstasy</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re my ecstasy</i></p><p>Your arms snaked underneath his, your fingers never left his skin. He could feel the heat from the trail of fire your fingers left on his skin. It was heavenly. He loved it, he loved you. He sighed deeply and let his head fall down onto your shoulder and tucked his nose into the crook of your neck. You smelled nice, like evening spent by the fire in a cabin by the woods. He loved it, it smelled like you and you were home to him. </p><p>You placed soft kisses to the exposed skin you could reach. Each one accompanied by a loving sigh from him, the hot breath fanning over your skin. This was more him, and even better it was softest version of him. Music began to flow through the speakers, soft beats leading you to sway with him in your arms. It was his favorite song. The one that had been playing over the speakers at the restaurant he\u2019d rented out on your first date. It was the song he sang to you on the rare nights you couldn\u2019t sleep or on the days were you just wanted to break down. </p><p><i>You\u2019re holy, holy, holy, holy</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m high on loving you, high on loving you</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re holy, holy, holy, holy</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m high on loving you, high on loving you</i></p><p>It was the way he\u2019d adopted saying I love you. \u201cI\u2019m high on loving you.\u201d He\u2019d say, a goofy grin on his lips before he kissed you. </p><p>You held him, supporting him as you swayed. He loved that you did that, both figuratively and literally. You held him up in the darkest of times, showed him that even when it was dark and it seemed never ending you would always be there to show him that there was a light, he just had to come back to it. </p><p>The ache in his head had subsided. Now he could hear the soft beats of the music and your soft humming. He smiled against your skin before he kissed it. Of course you played this song. It was your song, the song you listened to when he was away, when you wanted to hear him sing. He detached his fingers from yours and slid them up your arms. The callouses that lined his fingers and palms left tingles on your skin and you savored the feeling. \u00a0</p><p>He trailed kisses up your neck, drinking in the sighs from each one. He kissed along your jawline and up to your lips, where you were still smiling. He loved that smile. He never told you about how he\u2019d kept a picture of you smiling, just like you were now, in his suit. He kept one everywhere, in his wallet, on the background of his phone, on every surface he could put a picture frame. Because if he could see you and be with you, even if it wasn\u2019t physically, he was the luckiest man alive. </p><p>His forehead rested against your own, his hands lazily gripping your neck. His thumbs stroked along your jaw where he\u2019d been trailing kisses. You leaned into his touch, happy to have your Tony back. He smiled at you, the first one you\u2019d been able to see all night. It sent your heart soaring to see, your Tony, your big, soft teddy bear was in your arms dancing away in the kitchen. His gruff voice sounded out over the music singing the words as if he had wrote them himself, just for you. </p><p><i>You\u2019re the healing hands where it used to hurt<br>You\u2019re my saving grace, you\u2019re my kind of church<br>You\u2019re holy</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b0e3266e5fc0fc97d9fabbb3ce0a04b/tumblr_inline_pmktnniTiV1ticqtz_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><h2><i>If you liked this, let me know!

No matter how hard he tried, there would always be a day were he felt broken and useless. Where the darkness would cloud his mind so much that he couldn\u2019t breakthrough it all to see his sunshine, to see you. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Today was one of those days. The pressures of the world started to weigh so heavily on him, he couldn\u2019t move from them. He felt so alone like he had to tackle the world by himself, like he had no one to help shoulder the weight. It was so much for him to bear that he would forget he had you to help shoulder the weight because he only felt the loneliness. </p><p>You\u2019d found him in the lab in the middle of the night, hunched over his new project trying to distract his mind. Not that it was working. His hand reached out and grabbed the day old coffee he\u2019d left, not that he noticed the stale, bitter taste or the coldness of it.</p><p> His hands shook furiously as he tinkered with the wires of and older mark suit. He yelled out when the wire moved differently then he intended, sending sparks flying through the air. Then the part of the suit he been working on did the same, flying across the room to crash into the wall with a loud clang. The sound made him flinch and bury his head into his hands. </p><p><i>I never meant to cry, started losing hope<br>But somehow baby, you broke through and saved me<br>You\u2019re an angel, tell me you\u2019re never leaving</i></p><p>You placed a hand on the small of his back, schooling the hurt on your face when he flinched away from your touch. You knew it wasn\u2019t about you, you knew it was the thoughts than pounded against his skull. They were telling him he wasn\u2019t worth it, he didn\u2019t deserve the touch, that he had to stay in the darkness because he wasn\u2019t worth the sun. </p><p>Still, you kept your hand in place until he could pull himself out of the thoughts in his head. You\u2019d learned early on that you couldn\u2019t do the work for him, you could be his support but he had to pull himself out. It wasn\u2019t easy to stand by and watch but you knew it\u2019s what needed to happen. </p><p>The minutes ticked by ever so slowly, waiting for him to conquer his aggressive thoughts and come back to you but when the coldness of his fingers wrapped around your free hand you knew he had come back to you. Like a switch had been flipped, he now longed for your touch. He pulled you into himself and buried his face into your chest. His hand that gripped onto your own never left, only moving it to his chest. You ran your fingers through his hair, scratching the base of his neck and repeated the action for several minutes. </p><p><i>\u2018Cause you\u2019re the first thing I know I can believe in</i></p><p>The two of you were in the kitchen now. You knew it\u2019d been a while since he last ate, he always forgot about food when he felt like this. If he didn\u2019t deserve you, or anything else why would he deserve to eat. Beyond that, it would mean he wouldn\u2019t be doing enough to distract his mind and he couldn\u2019t afford that. The thoughts were already too intrusive when he was distracted. </p><p>He was starting to come back to himself. Your light starting to shine through what he thought was impenetrable darkness. He hadn\u2019t let go of your hand, still holding onto you as if you were just a figment of his imagination, a mirage created by his mind to trick him, to taunt him. It wasn\u2019t enough, he needed more. He needed the feel of your skin connecting with his, the spark he felt every time. Every time he touched your smooth skin, or brushed his lips against your perfect ones. </p><p><i>You made the brightest days from the darkest nights<br>You\u2019re the river bank where I was baptized<br>Cleanse all the demons<br>That were killing my freedom</i></p><p>You could see it in his eyes that he needed just a little more. He never was good at hiding his emotions, they showed clear as day in his beautiful brown eyes. They looked like chocolate to you, conveying the sweet and soft demeanor only few knew from him. He always laughed when you told him that, he didn\u2019t really like you thinking he was soft. But you couldn\u2019t help it, you had him wrapped around your finger, he would do anything for you. To see your eyes light up like the fireworks on a fourth of July night, or your smile beam at him like he was looking directly into the sun on a spring day. </p><p>Maybe he was soft.</p><p>He heard your sweet, melodic voice ring out into the air. He didn\u2019t catch what you said, his mind still beating on him but it was less now. He only felt the dull reminder of the words and his head didn\u2019t hurt as bad as it did earlier. He felt your soft fingers trail over his skin. Over his shoulders and down his back, the soft fabric of his shirt hindering your fingers from touching his skin. All he wanted to do was rip of the shirt so your skin could touch his. </p><p><i>I don\u2019t need the stars 'cause you shine for me</i></p><p><i>Like fire in my veins, you\u2019re my ecstasy</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re my ecstasy</i></p><p>Your arms snaked underneath his, your fingers never left his skin. He could feel the heat from the trail of fire your fingers left on his skin. It was heavenly. He loved it, he loved you. He sighed deeply and let his head fall down onto your shoulder and tucked his nose into the crook of your neck. You smelled nice, like evening spent by the fire in a cabin by the woods. He loved it, it smelled like you and you were home to him. </p><p>You placed soft kisses to the exposed skin you could reach. Each one accompanied by a loving sigh from him, the hot breath fanning over your skin. This was more him, and even better it was softest version of him. Music began to flow through the speakers, soft beats leading you to sway with him in your arms. It was his favorite song. The one that had been playing over the speakers at the restaurant he\u2019d rented out on your first date. It was the song he sang to you on the rare nights you couldn\u2019t sleep or on the days were you just wanted to break down. </p><p><i>You\u2019re holy, holy, holy, holy</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m high on loving you, high on loving you</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re holy, holy, holy, holy</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m high on loving you, high on loving you</i></p><p>It was the way he\u2019d adopted saying I love you. \u201cI\u2019m high on loving you.\u201d He\u2019d say, a goofy grin on his lips before he kissed you. </p><p>You held him, supporting him as you swayed. He loved that you did that, both figuratively and literally. You held him up in the darkest of times, showed him that even when it was dark and it seemed never ending you would always be there to show him that there was a light, he just had to come back to it. </p><p>The ache in his head had subsided. Now he could hear the soft beats of the music and your soft humming. He smiled against your skin before he kissed it. Of course you played this song. It was your song, the song you listened to when he was away, when you wanted to hear him sing. He detached his fingers from yours and slid them up your arms. The callouses that lined his fingers and palms left tingles on your skin and you savored the feeling. \u00a0</p><p>He trailed kisses up your neck, drinking in the sighs from each one. He kissed along your jawline and up to your lips, where you were still smiling. He loved that smile. He never told you about how he\u2019d kept a picture of you smiling, just like you were now, in his suit. He kept one everywhere, in his wallet, on the background of his phone, on every surface he could put a picture frame. Because if he could see you and be with you, even if it wasn\u2019t physically, he was the luckiest man alive. </p><p>His forehead rested against your own, his hands lazily gripping your neck. His thumbs stroked along your jaw where he\u2019d been trailing kisses. You leaned into his touch, happy to have your Tony back. He smiled at you, the first one you\u2019d been able to see all night. It sent your heart soaring to see, your Tony, your big, soft teddy bear was in your arms dancing away in the kitchen. His gruff voice sounded out over the music singing the words as if he had wrote them himself, just for you. </p><p><i>You\u2019re the healing hands where it used to hurt<br>You\u2019re my saving grace, you\u2019re my kind of church<br>You\u2019re holy</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b0e3266e5fc0fc97d9fabbb3ce0a04b/tumblr_inline_pmktnniTiV1ticqtz_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><h2><i>If you liked this, let me know!

I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts and honestly I need the validation.&nbsp;</p><p>Song:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXDAYlhdkyg\"> H.O.L.Y. by Florida Georgia Line</a></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17697125\">Read on AO3!</a></p><hr /><p><i>When the sun had left and the winter came</i></p><p><i>And the sky fall could only bring the rain</i></p><p><i>I sat in darkness, all broken hearted</i></p><p><i>I couldn&rsquo;t find a day I didn&rsquo;t feel alone</i></p><p>Everyday couldn&rsquo;t be a good day. No matter how hard he tried, there would always be a day were he felt broken and useless. Where the darkness would cloud his mind so much that he couldn&rsquo;t breakthrough it all to see his sunshine, to see you. </p><p>Today was one of those days. The pressures of the world started to weigh so heavily on him, he couldn&rsquo;t move from them. He felt so alone like he had to tackle the world by himself, like he had no one to help shoulder the weight. It was so much for him to bear that he would forget he had you to help shoulder the weight because he only felt the loneliness. </p><p>You&rsquo;d found him in the lab in the middle of the night, hunched over his new project trying to distract his mind. Not that it was working. His hand reached out and grabbed the day old coffee he&rsquo;d left, not that he noticed the stale, bitter taste or the coldness of it.</p><p> His hands shook furiously as he tinkered with the wires of and older mark suit. He yelled out when the wire moved differently then he intended, sending sparks flying through the air. Then the part of the suit he been working on did the same, flying across the room to crash into the wall with a loud clang. The sound made him flinch and bury his head into his hands. </p><p><i>I never meant to cry, started losing hope<br />But somehow baby, you broke through and saved me<br />You&rsquo;re an angel, tell me you&rsquo;re never leaving</i></p><p>You placed a hand on the small of his back, schooling the hurt on your face when he flinched away from your touch. You knew it wasn&rsquo;t about you, you knew it was the thoughts than pounded against his skull. They were telling him he wasn&rsquo;t worth it, he didn&rsquo;t deserve the touch, that he had to stay in the darkness because he wasn&rsquo;t worth the sun. </p><p>Still, you kept your hand in place until he could pull himself out of the thoughts in his head. You&rsquo;d learned early on that you couldn&rsquo;t do the work for him, you could be his support but he had to pull himself out. It wasn&rsquo;t easy to stand by and watch but you knew it&rsquo;s what needed to happen. </p><p>The minutes ticked by ever so slowly, waiting for him to conquer his aggressive thoughts and come back to you but when the coldness of his fingers wrapped around your free hand you knew he had come back to you. Like a switch had been flipped, he now longed for your touch. He pulled you into himself and buried his face into your chest. His hand that gripped onto your own never left, only moving it to his chest. You ran your fingers through his hair, scratching the base of his neck and repeated the action for several minutes. </p><p><i>&lsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re the first thing I know I can believe in</i></p><p>The two of you were in the kitchen now. You knew it&rsquo;d been a while since he last ate, he always forgot about food when he felt like this. If he didn&rsquo;t deserve you, or anything else why would he deserve to eat. Beyond that, it would mean he wouldn&rsquo;t be doing enough to distract his mind and he couldn&rsquo;t afford that. The thoughts were already too intrusive when he was distracted. </p><p>He was starting to come back to himself. Your light starting to shine through what he thought was impenetrable darkness. He hadn&rsquo;t let go of your hand, still holding onto you as if you were just a figment of his imagination, a mirage created by his mind to trick him, to taunt him. It wasn&rsquo;t enough, he needed more. He needed the feel of your skin connecting with his, the spark he felt every time. Every time he touched your smooth skin, or brushed his lips against your perfect ones. </p><p><i>You made the brightest days from the darkest nights<br />You&rsquo;re the river bank where I was baptized<br />Cleanse all the demons<br />That were killing my freedom</i></p><p>You could see it in his eyes that he needed just a little more. He never was good at hiding his emotions, they showed clear as day in his beautiful brown eyes. They looked like chocolate to you, conveying the sweet and soft demeanor only few knew from him. He always laughed when you told him that, he didn&rsquo;t really like you thinking he was soft. But you couldn&rsquo;t help it, you had him wrapped around your finger, he would do anything for you. To see your eyes light up like the fireworks on a fourth of July night, or your smile beam at him like he was looking directly into the sun on a spring day. </p><p>Maybe he was soft.</p><p>He heard your sweet, melodic voice ring out into the air. He didn&rsquo;t catch what you said, his mind still beating on him but it was less now. He only felt the dull reminder of the words and his head didn&rsquo;t hurt as bad as it did earlier. He felt your soft fingers trail over his skin. Over his shoulders and down his back, the soft fabric of his shirt hindering your fingers from touching his skin. All he wanted to do was rip of the shirt so your skin could touch his. </p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t need the stars 'cause you shine for me</i></p><p><i>Like fire in my veins, you&rsquo;re my ecstasy</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re my ecstasy</i></p><p>Your arms snaked underneath his, your fingers never left his skin. He could feel the heat from the trail of fire your fingers left on his skin. It was heavenly. He loved it, he loved you. He sighed deeply and let his head fall down onto your shoulder and tucked his nose into the crook of your neck. You smelled nice, like evening spent by the fire in a cabin by the woods. He loved it, it smelled like you and you were home to him. </p><p>You placed soft kisses to the exposed skin you could reach. Each one accompanied by a loving sigh from him, the hot breath fanning over your skin. This was more him, and even better it was softest version of him. Music began to flow through the speakers, soft beats leading you to sway with him in your arms. It was his favorite song. The one that had been playing over the speakers at the restaurant he&rsquo;d rented out on your first date. It was the song he sang to you on the rare nights you couldn&rsquo;t sleep or on the days were you just wanted to break down. </p><p><i>You&rsquo;re holy, holy, holy, holy</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m high on loving you, high on loving you</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re holy, holy, holy, holy</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m high on loving you, high on loving you</i></p><p>It was the way he&rsquo;d adopted saying I love you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m high on loving you.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d say, a goofy grin on his lips before he kissed you. </p><p>You held him, supporting him as you swayed.
