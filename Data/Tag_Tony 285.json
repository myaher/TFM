You know, if you wanted my attention you didn\u2019t have to go to such extremes.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m doing this for Peter &amp; Tony, hope that\u2019s okay! :D</i></p><hr><p>\u201cDude,\u201d says Ned, his eyes going wide in a semblance of revelation from one of the semi-comfortable blue chairs in the nurse\u2019s office. He lowers his voice, ever so slightly.\u00a0\u201cSince you\u2019re a superhero, aren\u2019t you, like, immune to stuff like this?\u201d<br/></p><p>A brief look of surprise flitters across Peter\u2019s features, too.\u00a0\u201cThat - makes sense. Yeah, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t need the vaccination?\u201d Ned pulls a face.\u00a0\u201cLucky.\u201d<br/></p><p>The nurse comes back with a needle and a small swab of cotton. She looks at Peter harshly over the rim of outdated spectacles.\u00a0\u201cDo you need the flu vaccine, Mr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter discretely crumples the signed yellow form in his fist and shrugs.\u00a0\u201cEr, no. I already had it. At the doctor\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll need you to wait outside.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter nods, catching Ned\u2019s look of jealousy and flashing him the thumbs up as he wanders outside, pressing his back against the wall while he waits.\u00a0</p><p>He spots MJ with a plaster at the top of her arm from the vaccine and fails to hide the smug look on his face. She spots him and flips him the bird.</p><p>Ned walks out a second later, absently rubbing at his arm.\u00a0\u201cIt feels dead.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiles sympathetically.\u00a0\u201cAt least you won\u2019t get the virus that\u2019s going around.\u201d</p><p>Ned shrugs.\u00a0\u201cI guess.\u201d He looks at Peter.\u00a0\u201cBut you know what would really make me feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the LEGO Iron Man in my locker,\u201d Peter grins.<br/></p><!-- more --><hr><p><i>Hey Mr. Stark!</i> Peter punches out on his phone. He sits on the roof of a particularly tall building, his legs swinging over the ledge. The wintry sun somehow penetrates his skin and he quietly whips his mask off, wiping the beads of sweat with his sleeve. <i>Is it cool if I swing by the compound tonight?</i></p><p>While he waits for a response, a notification pops up from <b>leedtheway:</b> <i>hey peter i think\u00a0mj\u2019s onto our surprise party idea</i></p><p>It\u2019s followed by: <i>oh crap are u spidermanning pls send a pic from the empire state building</i></p><p>And then:<i> but not if ur kicking ass or something that\u2019s cooler</i></p><p>Finally Tony texts back. <i>Hey kid, sorry to disappoint but I\u2019ve got a board meeting tonight. I\u2019ll pick you up from school tomorrow. P.S. Did you seriously unironically use the word\u00a0\u2018swing\u2019 just to make a Spider-Man pun</i></p><p>Peter gazes down at the screen in disappointment, but he tries to make his response as lighthearted as possible. <i>Did you seriously unironically use the word \u2018unironically\u2019 because it has\u00a0\u2018iron\u2019 in it</i></p><p>The typing dots linger beside Tony\u2019s name for a long time, before the response finally comes through.\u00a0<i>Yes.</i></p><p>Smirking, Peter swipes back onto Ned\u2019s chat and says: <i>I\u2019m just on some building man. how\u2019s your arm?</i></p><p><i>feels like i got bitten by a radioactive spider</i></p><p><i>i can relate</i></p><p>Peter switches off his phone and slips it into his pocket as he scans the street below. He absently wrestles with his mask, briefly wondering if it\u2019s worth sacrificing his identity for the feeling of the brisk winter air against his warming face. Eventually he sighs and pulls the mask back on.</p><p><i>\u201cPeter, your temperature is slightly higher than average.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine Karen, just from moving around.\u201d He stands up.\u00a0\u201cAny news?\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m picking up on a robbery relatively close by,\u201d</i> says Karen.\u00a0<i>\u201cThey appear to be unarmed.\u201d<br/></i></p><p>\u201cSounds easy,\u201d Peter says, aiming a stream of webbing at an adjacent building.\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll light up the path for you.\u201d</i></p><p>He swings relatively smoothly between the buildings and lampposts. At one point, he drops low to the ground to high five a kid in a Spider-Man shirt as he passes. The girl giggles and waves as he hoists himself back into the air, legs pulled into his chest as he latches the next wall.</p><p>When he arrives at the scene, he feels hotter than ever, and a writhing sort of discomfort moves around in his stomach. He wants to rip the mask off his face. Instead, Peter winces:\u00a0\u201cJeez Karen, is the heater on?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNo. Your temperature is climbing.

Now, is this how you greet a King, Peter? No welcome kiss?\u201d The Dane spoke with a husky voice, leaning over Peter on the sofa.

The coldness in Peter&rsquo;s limbs was replaced with a warm tingling sensation as the King locked his brown eyes with his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cForgive me\u2026\u201d Peter said, feeling a little coy as he leaned to kiss the Dane sweetly on the lips.

The position was a little awkward for the Prince, with his torso against the King, one leg on the sofa and the other dangling over the edge.

And what are we to do about Steve Rogers?&rdquo; The Prince blurted out in a hurry, causing the Dane to raise his brows and the Swede to chuckle into his glass.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We can tend to those later. Now, is this how you greet a King, Peter? No welcome kiss?&rdquo; The Dane spoke with a husky voice, leaning over Peter on the sofa. He placed one hand on the Prince&rsquo;s thigh, the shiny vambrace catching the light. His other hand snaked around Peter&rsquo;s neck, his fingertips brushing against the curls on his nape. The coldness in Peter&rsquo;s limbs was replaced with a warm tingling sensation as the King locked his brown eyes with his.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me&hellip;&rdquo; Peter said, feeling a little coy as he leaned to kiss the Dane sweetly on the lips. Their tongues danced together and Peter moaned quietly in the back of his throat. Anthony&rsquo;s face was still chilly from the long journey, but his lips looked a deep and warm red when Peter pulled away from the kiss.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, a strong hand grasped Peter by the collarbone and shoulder, flipping him around and making him land against the Swede&rsquo;s chest. With his other hand, Stephen lifted Peter&rsquo;s chin and kissed him passionately. Both men moaned with satisfaction and the King brought his hands up to stroke Peter&rsquo;s cheeks. The Prince had to pull away, breathless, looking up at the King&rsquo;s blue-green eyes through his lashes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You must learn to share, Tony.&rdquo; Stephen said teasingly, placing a hand on Peter&rsquo;s lower back.
