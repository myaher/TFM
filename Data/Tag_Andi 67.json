        "answer": "<p>It hurts me too anon. I feel like TJ and Jonah are tied for Character On Andi Mack Who Cannot Seem to Catch A Break\u2122</p><p>I agree, TJ doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a support system. Sure, he\u2019s on good terms with Buffy and Jonah now. And he definitely has quite a few basketball friends. But when he told Cyrus\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re the only person I can talk to like this\u201d you can tell he really meant it.\u00a0</p><p>I imagine the next episode with TJ to be very similar to The New Girls, with TJ sulking and sitting alone at lunch. Except this time, TJ will be actively avoiding Cyrus, instead of blowing up his phone like last time he had to apologize. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Cyrus is the one to confront TJ about what happened.\u00a0</p><p>Which means emotionally closed-off TJ Kippen will have to be vulnerable in front of Cyrus Goodman, the only person he <i>used</i>\u00a0to be able to talk to, but can\u2019t anymore because he lost his trust. It\u2019s going to make apologizing all the more difficult.</p><p>It\u2019s going to make the inevitable coming out scene difficult as well. When Cyrus came out to Andi and Jonah, he had friends there to support him.

Tandi fic</i></p><p>By the time he\u2019s sixteen, the fighting that goes on between TJ\u2019s parents has become so unbearable he\u2019s taken to slipping out the front door and sleeping on benches in the park several nights a week. He doesn\u2019t mean for anybody to find out about this, mostly because he feels too embarrassed to admit the way his mom and dad scream at one another scares him a little, but he\u2019s beginning to realise that only death could stop Andi from sniffing out trouble when she\u2019s worried about her friends. She waits on his doorstep one night, catching him sneaking out around midnight, and less than half an hour later he finds himself sat in the cracking plastic booth of a local twenty-four-hour cafe sipping terrible coffee and spilling everything to her. </p><p>After that, he doesn\u2019t have to sleep on benches anymore. When he hears raised voices and the tell-tale slam of the kitchen door, he\u2019ll hightail it out of there and head straight for the Macks\u2019 house.

Then she turns to her daughter, who has now managed to escape her blanket prison and slide herself carefully into the space between Bowie and TJ, perhaps in an attempt to prevent any early-morning murders. \u201cAndi, why is TJ in your bedroom at seven thirty in the morning?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause and they all watch the cogs turn in Andi\u2019s brain as she scrambles to think of a good cover story. \u201c\u2026He came over to study?\u201d</p><p>Bex sighs. \u201cI thought I taught you to like better than that. C\u2019mon now, what\u2019s the truth? Have you been here all night, TJ?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe was in her bed!\u201d Bowie reiterates, seething. \u201cHer bed, Bex! Teenagers! Bed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened!\u201d Andi says, horror dawning on her face. \u201cWe were just sleeping!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why wasn\u2019t TJ sleeping in his own bed? At his house\u2026 you know, that place where he lives?\u201d Bex asks.</p><p>The two teenagers glance at one another and Andi bites her lip. For one terrifying moment Bex is afraid they\u2019re about to tell her that TJ has been kicked out. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019ll do if that\u2019s the case. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d TJ says. \u201cMy parents have been fighting\u2026 I needed a place to crash. Andi was just being a good friend.\u201d</p><p>Both Bex and Bowie soften at that.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell us that?\u201d Bowie asks, the anger draining away fast.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t let me have sleepovers on weekdays,\u201d Andi says, her tone implying a strong \u2018duh\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWell yeah, but this is a little bit different,\u201d Bex says. \u201cIf you\u2019d told us we could\u2019ve like\u2026 set up the couch or something. Made sure TJ had dinner and stuff. How long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>Andi and TJ give non-committal shrugs and Bex knows she\u2019s not going to get a straight answer on that. Bowie steps in, his regular personality rejoining the party in place of Andi Mack\u2019s Father. </p><p>\u201cTJ, do your parents know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cOh man, they could be freaking out right now. You can\u2019t just sneak out without telling them, what if you got hurt or went missing or something-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t notice I\u2019m gone. They never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bowie looks at Bex, quite unsure what to do. They seem almost to have a conversation with their eyes that TJ cannot quite understand, and they both turn back to look at him. \u201cOkay, well\u2026 we can talk about this later. You guys need to get ready for school. I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys want some breakfast?\u201d Bex asks, turning back to head into the kitchen. \u201cI can try and make pancakes again.\u201d</p><p>Andi groans loudly, normality seeping back into the house at once and trails after Bex. \u201cOh, please don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to have to call the fire department again\u2026\u201d</p><p>Relief washes over TJ. He had worried for a moment that he was either about to meet his death or get banned from the Macks\u2019 house forever. He isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d do if he couldn\u2019t go to Andi - he doesn\u2019t want to go back to sleeping on a bench. Bowie steps over to him and he tries not to flinch as the man lays a gentle hand on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled,\u201d he says, looking TJ directly in the eye. \u201cIt just took me by surprise is all\u2026 from now on just let us know when you\u2019re coming over, yeah? You\u2019re always welcome here, but we have to know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>TJ nods and knows he\u2019ll do as he\u2019s told without question. \u201cI promise.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood man,\u201d Bowie ruffles his hair and heads out towards the kitchen, leaving a stunned TJ in his wake. </p><p>Bex doesn\u2019t quite burn down the kitchen with her pancakes, and they get TJ his own inflatable mattress to sleep on after that.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>Thank you! Platonic Tandi is life and your wish is my command. And you can find the post that quote originates from <b><a href=\"https://captainkippen.tumblr.com/post/183291948423/hello-sir-could-you-write-some-fluffy-tandi\">here.</a></b></p></blockquote><h2><b>A Place To Stay</b></h2><p><i>&ndash; A Platonic! Tandi fic</i></p><p>By the time he&rsquo;s sixteen, the fighting that goes on between TJ&rsquo;s parents has become so unbearable he&rsquo;s taken to slipping out the front door and sleeping on benches in the park several nights a week. He doesn&rsquo;t mean for anybody to find out about this, mostly because he feels too embarrassed to admit the way his mom and dad scream at one another scares him a little, but he&rsquo;s beginning to realise that only death could stop Andi from sniffing out trouble when she&rsquo;s worried about her friends. She waits on his doorstep one night, catching him sneaking out around midnight, and less than half an hour later he finds himself sat in the cracking plastic booth of a local twenty-four-hour cafe sipping terrible coffee and spilling everything to her. </p><p>After that, he doesn&rsquo;t have to sleep on benches anymore. When he hears raised voices and the tell-tale slam of the kitchen door, he&rsquo;ll hightail it out of there and head straight for the Macks&rsquo; house. Climbing in Andi&rsquo;s window becomes a habit, one that Bex and Bowie don&rsquo;t know a thing about, and it becomes one of those teenage secrets that are so carefully kept that it&rsquo;s inevitable it will come crashing down around their ears. </p><p>And it does.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the morning after one particularly bad night, the screaming had become crying and TJ had had to hold back his own tears as he crept out of his house. Andi&rsquo;s bed is a comfortable cocoon of blankets and limbs, the two of them wrapped around one another having fallen asleep in a comforting embrace, and the sun shines too-bright across their faces through the gap in the curtain. It&rsquo;s not the sun that wakes them though. It&rsquo;s Bowie&rsquo;s yell of &ldquo;WHAT THE FUCK?&rdquo; that has them both bolting upright in confusion, eyes still bleary with sleep. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God,&rdquo; Andi says, going from half asleep to wide-awake and alert when she sees the look of rage on his face. &ldquo;Dad-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why the hell are you in my daughter&rsquo;s bed?!&rdquo; </p><p>Now, Bowie Quinn is not a violent man. He never has been and he never will be. But at that moment Bowie Quinn was no longer Bowie Quinn - he was Andi Mack&rsquo;s Father and Andi Mack&rsquo;s Father was more than happy to lunge at TJ. Therefore, it is fortunate that TJ is a relatively limber young man and thus has no troubling ducking out of the way and rolling off the bed. It is not an especially graceful motion but it gets the job done and he is half-way across the room well out of Bowie&rsquo;s reach in a heartbeat.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, calm down!&rdquo; Andi yells, struggling out of the burrito that has become of her comforter. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me to calm down! There&rsquo;s a boy in your bed! A boy! In your bed!&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a very smart move for TJ to butt in when he does, but teenage boys are never ones for common sense and all his survival instincts appeared to have deserted him right then. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not in her bed any more,&rdquo; he points out, then immediately wishes he hadn&rsquo;t. </p><p>Bowie turns on him looking a little less like he&rsquo;s about to wring TJ&rsquo;s neck as he did before but still not exactly the definition of welcoming. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on in here?&rdquo; Bex appears in the doorway, still clutching an open box of Captain Crunch, her brow furrowed in confusion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the shouting?&rdquo;</p><p>Bowie gestures wildly at TJ and splutters in a somewhat incoherent manner, &ldquo;Boy! Bed! Boy! There&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo; </p><p>Bex looks over at TJ, eyes widening in surprise, and takes in his ruffled appearance. He&rsquo;s dressed in his own t-shirt and what appears to be a pair of Bowie&rsquo;s old sweatpants - there are still red lines from where the creases of Andi&rsquo;s pillow pressed into his face while he slept. It dawns on Bex all of a sudden that this is where Bowie&rsquo;s lost old clothes have been going, and probably why the spare toothbrush went missing from the bathroom last month, and even more likely the reason they&rsquo;ve had to go grocery shopping so much more than usual recently. </p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; she greets, nodding to him.

Relax for a bit,\u201d shouted Bex to Andi,\nwho was precariously standing on Cece\u2019s railing, hanging up decorations for the\nNew Year\u2019s party that night. </p><p>\u201cSays\nyou!\u201d Andi shouted back, demounting the railing. \u201cBuffy, Cyrus, TJ, and Kira\nare coming at 10, and it\u2019s already 9!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d\nBex put down her magazine and looked at Andi, \u201cKira\u2019s coming? I thought you\nguys hated her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\nhaven\u2019t invited her but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019ll end up coming along with TJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nI thought TJ liked Cyrus. He\u2019s dating Kira now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\nwere you listening at all when I told you about the whole Costume Day mess?\u201d</p><p>Bex\npaused for a moment, trying to muster up an excuse, \u201cI guess, with all the wedding\nemotions it got lost in my brain. Sorry, kid.\u201d</p><p>Andi\u2019s\nface drooped. A wedding would\u2019ve been nice (to say the least) after all their\nwill-they, won\u2019t-they drama. Something to cement it all. But, Bex and Bowie are\nstill Bex and Bowie. Anyway, she had other things to think about. It was T-minus\n54 minutes until the guests were to arrive and the house still wasn\u2019t ready.\nCece was out doing some last-minute donations she missed out on during Christmas,\nAndi was decorating the living room, and Bex was currently lifting herself off\nthe couch to get more chips (for herself <i>and</i>\nthe party) with Bowie.</p><p>***</p><p>T-minus\n3 minutes and everything looked, as Andi said, \u201cJust about ready,\u201d</p><p>A\nplayful knock came at the door. \u201cIt\u2019s Buffy and Cyrus, I\u2019ll get it!\u201d Andi called\nto her family as she ran to the door.</p><p>\u201cHi,\nAlex, right?\u201d said Kira, smiling, as she interlocked hands with a deadpanned\nTJ.</p><p>\u201cUh,\nit\u2019s Andi, actually,\u201d Andi\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, \u201ccome in.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Kira\npranced into the house dragging TJ behind her. TJ could barely manage to get\nout a faint \u201cHey, Andi,\u201d before Kira pulled him away and sat him on the couch. </p><p>\u201cCan\nI get you guys anything? Chips and soda?\u201d Andi asked, hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cChips\nwould be great, thanks,\u201d Andi started to walk to the kitchen with her hands stuck\nto her side, \u201coh, and Alex?\u201d Andi turned around and sighed, \u201ca diet coke for me\nand a sprite for TJ,\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\nI\u2019ll just have some water,\u201d muttered TJ, as Kira shot him a glare.</p><p>\u201cGot\nit,\u201d Andi swiveled on her heel and left to the kitchen.</p><p>There\nwas another knock at the door. \u201cTJ, its probably Cyrus and Buffy,\u201d Kira\u2019s ears\nperked up at their names, \u201ccan you get it?\u201d Andi called from the kitchen.</p><p>TJ\nbegan to push himself off the couch, but Kira pushed him back down, \u201cI\u2019ll get\nit,\u201d said Kira, as she bounced to the door. </p><p>\u201cHey\nguys!\u201d she greeted.</p><p>Buffy\nshoved past her pulling Cyrus along. Cyrus stopped when he saw TJ. \u201cBuffy, he\u2019s\nhere. With Kira!\u201d he whisper-shouted.</p><p>Buffy\nlooked at the two in disgust before replying, \u201cI\u2019m confused, too,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\ntold me he was going to tell Kira to back off!\u201d</p><p>Buffy\nshook her head and followed Cyrus into the kitchen. Neither dared to look at TJ.</p><p>\u201cAndi,\nwhat is Kira doing here?\u201d interrogated Buffy, her eyes wide,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, she just showed up with TJ. I couldn\u2019t exactly make her leave,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, you can. Follow me,\u201d Buffy retorted as she marched into the living\nroom, \u201cKira, can I talk to you outside?\u201d</p><p>Kira\nfrowned suspiciously at Buffy, following her out to the porch. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you doing here?\u201d Buffy started, \u201cYou\u2019re not friends with any of us,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\nTJ goes, I go,\u201d replied Kira.</p><p>\u201cWas\nthat TJ\u2019s choice or was it just what you told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ\u2019s\na nice guy, Kira. And he can make his own decisions. He doesn\u2019t need some\nrandom girl with a terrible attitude to make them for him,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\nyou just call TJ a \u2018nice guy\u2019? Wow, Buffy, you\u2019ve gone soft,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\nKira, I\u2019m trying to be reasonable but you\u2019re testing my patience. Cyrus is an incredible\nperson and whatever you said to TJ before Costume Day basically destroyed their\nfriendship,\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriendship?\nJust <i>friends</i>? Because it seemed like\nmore than that to me. Is that really what you want for Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>The\nargument falls silent. Buffy\u2019s mouth is slightly agape. \u201cYou need to leave.\nRight now,\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\nBut just so you know, TJ\u2019s with me now. Not Cyrus, me,\u201d Kira huffed before\nwalking out of the compound, slamming the gate shut behind her. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndo you think Buffy\u2019s going to tell Kira?\u201d asked Cyrus, intermittently peeking\nthrough the kitchen door to check on TJ.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll\nprobably get rid of her somehow. I wouldn\u2019t question it too much,\u201d Andi trailed\noff when she noticed Cyrus\u2019 gaze fixed on TJ, who was currently sitting on the\ncouch fiddling with his phone case, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go talk to him?\u201d she questioned.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nsay what? We haven\u2019t spoken since he apologised for the costume, and I don\u2019t know\nhow to talk to him after what he told Buffy and me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout\nthat, what happened? You guys never told me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nisn\u2019t really our story to tell. He\u2019ll tell you when he\u2019s ready. But since he\nsaid that, I figured he\u2019d break up with Kira. He even told me he would, but I guess\nKira\u2019s still got him wrapped around her finger,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsure he has a good reason. I didn\u2019t like TJ for a long time, but I\u2019ve seen the\nway he acts around you. Something lights up in him, Cy. He makes you happy, and\nI think you make him happy, too,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nreally think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndo,\u201d</p><p>Andi\nwas interrupted by Buffy storming back into the house. She sat down next to TJ,\nsilent. </p><p>\u201cFrom\nthe lack of blood on your clothes, I take it you <i>didn\u2019t </i>kill Kira?\u201d TJ remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\nwas close, but no. She did leave, though,\u201d</p><p>TJ\nbreathed a sigh of relief, prompting Buffy to urge him to talk to Cyrus, \u201cI\nknow you like him,\u201d she gestured towards the kitchen, where Cyrus and Andi were\nstill peering at the other boy, \u201cyou should talk to him,\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nright, Driscoll. For once, I actually mean it,\u201d TJ stood up halfway but sat\nback down, \u201cBut I have no idea what to say,\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nsay \u2018hi\u2019 and see what happens. You two have never had trouble finding things to\ntalk about before,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nturns out, we\u2019re a lot alike,\u201d</p><p>TJ\nnodded and stood up all the way. He took a deep breath and made his way to the\nkitchen. Andi smirked and speed walked into the living room to sit next to Buffy.\n</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cCan\nI talk to you for a minute?\u201d TJ asked, twiddling his thumbs, barely looking at\nCyrus.</p><p>\u201cI\nwas actually just about to ask you the same thing,\u201d Cyrus replied, \u201cLet\u2019s go to\nAndi Shack. It\u2019s more private than\u2014\u201d he looked over at Buffy and Andi, who were\nstaring intently at the two boys, \u201chere,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\nled TJ to the backyard and into Andi Shack. \u201cIsn\u2019t Andi going to kill you for\nbeing here without her permission?\u201d TJ asked as he fumbled in the dark for a\nlight switch.</p><p>\u201cNot\nnecessarily,\u201d TJ looked up in confusion, \u201cIt depends on how this conversation\ngoes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nsee,\u201d</p><p>After\ncarefully moving pieces of art and art materials, the two sat down on a\ntattered bench covered in old paint.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nKira, huh?\u201d Cyrus started.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow what I said, Cy, but, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated,\nI got it,\u201d he paused, \u201cWhat you told me the other day, you were being serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, I was. I\u2019d never joke about that,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\nsmiled at TJ, but TJ\u2019s face was still full of worry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it?\u201d asked Cyrus.</p><p>TJ\nstared at Cyrus blankly for a few moments, \u201cI think you\u2019re really great, Cyrus,\u201d\nhis eyes shifted down to the floor, \u201cand I,\u201d TJ gulped.</p><p>\u201cTJ\nit\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to say anything you\u2019re not ready to say. My parents\nsay that\u2019s almost as bad as bottling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\nI kiss you at midnight?\u201d TJ interrupted, causing Cyrus to go pale, his eyes\nwider than an owl\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCan\nyou\u2014\u201d Cyrus trailed off, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cNever\nmind, it was a dumb question. You probably don\u2019t want to, anyway. I guess this\nconversation didn\u2019t go as well as Andi had hoped and we\u2019re probably dead meat,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeej,\u201d\nCyrus called, as he noticed TJ getting up to leave, \u201cyou can,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan?\u201d TJ said, turning around to face Cyrus, subconscious smiles creeping onto their\nfaces.</p><p>Cyrus\nsimply nodded and stood up to hold the other boy\u2019s hand, \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold. We\nshould go back inside,\u201d</p><p>They\nswitched off the light and went back into the house.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cBex,\nBowie! There\u2019s less than an hour left, set the food out in the living room!\u201d\nshouted Cece from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cComing,\nI\u2019m coming,\u201d Bowie pulled her up off the couch and gently pushed her towards\nthe kitchen, following not far behind.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink Cyrus and TJ made up,\u201d Bex told Bowie, eyeing the boys as they entered\nthe house.</p><p>\u201cWhy\ndo you invest yourself in the lives of thirteen-year-olds, Rebecca?\u201d questioned\nCece, handing each one a tray stacked with sandwiches and cake.</p><p>\u201cWhen\nwere TJ and Cyrus fighting?\u201d asked Bowie, walking out of the kitchen with his\ntrays as well as Bex\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsure Andi will be glad to know I pay more attention to her rambling than her\nown father,\u201d she replied, cheekily, taking the trays from Bowie and setting them\ndown on the coffee table.</p><p>The\nkids immediately took notice of the food and stampeded towards the table. An\nassortment of compliments towards Cece\u2019s were spoken by food-filled mouths.</p><p>***</p><p>With\nless than 2 minutes till the end of the year and a room full of satisfied\nstomachs and neighbourhood friendly music, the seven of them stood around the\nliving room. Bowie and Bex were already standing in the corner, ready for\nmidnight. Andi and Buffy were sitting on one side of the couch, somehow still eating\nthe remaining chips, as they waited for the countdown. Cece was just trying not\nto fall asleep but gave in and went upstairs after reminding the kids (including\nBex and Bowie) to clean up whatever mess they make. Cyrus was sitting next to\nBuffy, and TJ was sitting next to Cyrus. </p><p>The\nkids\u2019 conversation was a long, muffled noise to the outside listener, but as\nthe clock neared twelve, the chaos turned into a countdown. </p><p>\u201cTen,\nnine, eight, seven, six, five, four,\u201d Cyrus and TJ turned towards each other,\nbarely three inches apart. The rest of the room faded to a big blur. It was\njust the two of them and there was no going back now.</p><p>\u201cThree,\ntwo, one.\u201d</p><p>As the\nrest cheered, \u201cHappy New Year!\u201d TJ had his hands gripped around Cyrus\u2019 waist,\nand Cyrus\u2019 hands were entangled in the other boy\u2019s hair. Their eyes were closed\ntight, lips together, indifferent to the world. </p><p>The\nboys pulled away at the same time, when they realised the cheering had stopped.\nThey opened their eyes to four people staring at them in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThey\n<i>really</i> made up, huh?\u201d added Bowie,\nbreaking the silence. The rest chuckled as the new year began.</p><p>***</p><p>The\nnext morning, the four kids went to The Spoon to meet up with Jonah. </p><p>\u201cI apparently\nmissed a lot,\u201d Jonah stated, watching Cyrus and TJ walk in, hand in hand.</p><p>\u201cNot\nmuch,\u201d Cyrus chuckled and turned to TJ, who was trying to refrain from smiling.</p><p>\u201cBaby\ntaters?\u201d Amber asked, approaching the table, \u201cand happy new year, by the way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirstly,\nis that even a question, and secondly, you too, Ambs,\u201d Andi blushed.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nthat\u2019s baby taters and,\u201d her expression turned grim, \u201cTJ, Kira came by earlier\nasking for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\nKippen, you got a second?\u201d It was Kira. Again.</p><p>TJ\nstood up, \u201cAnything you want to say to me, you can say in front of them,\u201d Amber\nslowly backed away.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d\nKira looked around the table, \u201cfine. I\u2019m sorry. What I did to you was vindictive\nand, if I\u2019m being honest, I mostly did it to get back at Buffy,\u201d she mouths \u2018sorry\u2019\nto Buffy, \u201cIt was wrong. I saw TJ and thought I had a chance but then Cyrus came\nalong, and I figured, \u2018why not?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nstill made two people feel badly about themselves just for being who they were,\u201d\nretorted Buffy.</p><p>\u201cSometimes\nthere\u2019s a nice person trying to get out. I guess I still haven\u2019t figured out\nhow to do that. My parents told my neighbours what I told Buffy. I didn\u2019t\nrealise how much that would hurt someone. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She walked out of the\ndiner without a second glance. </p><p>\u201cWell,\nat least she knows how to apologise unlike <i>some\n</i>of us,\u201d Buffy joked.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d\nTJ responded, \u201cI can say\u2014&quot;</p><p>\u201cTeej,\u201d\nCyrus gestured at his hands under the table.

TJ could barely manage to get\nout a faint \u201cHey, Andi,\u201d before Kira pulled him away and sat him on the couch. </p><p>\u201cCan\nI get you guys anything? Chips and soda?\u201d Andi asked, hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cChips\nwould be great, thanks,\u201d Andi started to walk to the kitchen with her hands stuck\nto her side, \u201coh, and Alex?\u201d Andi turned around and sighed, \u201ca diet coke for me\nand a sprite for TJ,\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\nI\u2019ll just have some water,\u201d muttered TJ, as Kira shot him a glare.</p><p>\u201cGot\nit,\u201d Andi swiveled on her heel and left to the kitchen.</p><p>There\nwas another knock at the door. \u201cTJ, its probably Cyrus and Buffy,\u201d Kira\u2019s ears\nperked up at their names, \u201ccan you get it?\u201d Andi called from the kitchen.</p><p>TJ\nbegan to push himself off the couch, but Kira pushed him back down, \u201cI\u2019ll get\nit,\u201d said Kira, as she bounced to the door. </p><p>\u201cHey\nguys!\u201d she greeted.</p><p>Buffy\nshoved past her pulling Cyrus along. Cyrus stopped when he saw TJ. \u201cBuffy, he\u2019s\nhere. With Kira!\u201d he whisper-shouted.</p><p>Buffy\nlooked at the two in disgust before replying, \u201cI\u2019m confused, too,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\ntold me he was going to tell Kira to back off!\u201d</p><p>Buffy\nshook her head and followed Cyrus into the kitchen. Neither dared to look at TJ.</p><p>\u201cAndi,\nwhat is Kira doing here?\u201d interrogated Buffy, her eyes wide,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, she just showed up with TJ. I couldn\u2019t exactly make her leave,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, you can. Follow me,\u201d Buffy retorted as she marched into the living\nroom, \u201cKira, can I talk to you outside?\u201d</p><p>Kira\nfrowned suspiciously at Buffy, following her out to the porch. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you doing here?\u201d Buffy started, \u201cYou\u2019re not friends with any of us,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\nTJ goes, I go,\u201d replied Kira.</p><p>\u201cWas\nthat TJ\u2019s choice or was it just what you told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ\u2019s\na nice guy, Kira. And he can make his own decisions. He doesn\u2019t need some\nrandom girl with a terrible attitude to make them for him,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\nyou just call TJ a \u2018nice guy\u2019? Wow, Buffy, you\u2019ve gone soft,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\nKira, I\u2019m trying to be reasonable but you\u2019re testing my patience. Cyrus is an incredible\nperson and whatever you said to TJ before Costume Day basically destroyed their\nfriendship,\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriendship?\nJust <i>friends</i>? Because it seemed like\nmore than that to me. Is that really what you want for Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>The\nargument falls silent. Buffy\u2019s mouth is slightly agape. \u201cYou need to leave.\nRight now,\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\nBut just so you know, TJ\u2019s with me now. Not Cyrus, me,\u201d Kira huffed before\nwalking out of the compound, slamming the gate shut behind her. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndo you think Buffy\u2019s going to tell Kira?\u201d asked Cyrus, intermittently peeking\nthrough the kitchen door to check on TJ.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll\nprobably get rid of her somehow. I wouldn\u2019t question it too much,\u201d Andi trailed\noff when she noticed Cyrus\u2019 gaze fixed on TJ, who was currently sitting on the\ncouch fiddling with his phone case, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go talk to him?\u201d she questioned.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nsay what? We haven\u2019t spoken since he apologised for the costume, and I don\u2019t know\nhow to talk to him after what he told Buffy and me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout\nthat, what happened? You guys never told me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nisn\u2019t really our story to tell. He\u2019ll tell you when he\u2019s ready. But since he\nsaid that, I figured he\u2019d break up with Kira. He even told me he would, but I guess\nKira\u2019s still got him wrapped around her finger,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsure he has a good reason. I didn\u2019t like TJ for a long time, but I\u2019ve seen the\nway he acts around you. Something lights up in him, Cy. He makes you happy, and\nI think you make him happy, too,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nreally think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndo,\u201d</p><p>Andi\nwas interrupted by Buffy storming back into the house. She sat down next to TJ,\nsilent. </p><p>\u201cFrom\nthe lack of blood on your clothes, I take it you <i>didn\u2019t </i>kill Kira?\u201d TJ remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\nwas close, but no. She did leave, though,\u201d</p><p>TJ\nbreathed a sigh of relief, prompting Buffy to urge him to talk to Cyrus, \u201cI\nknow you like him,\u201d she gestured towards the kitchen, where Cyrus and Andi were\nstill peering at the other boy, \u201cyou should talk to him,\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nright, Driscoll. For once, I actually mean it,\u201d TJ stood up halfway but sat\nback down, \u201cBut I have no idea what to say,\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nsay \u2018hi\u2019 and see what happens. You two have never had trouble finding things to\ntalk about before,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nturns out, we\u2019re a lot alike,\u201d</p><p>TJ\nnodded and stood up all the way. He took a deep breath and made his way to the\nkitchen. Andi smirked and speed walked into the living room to sit next to Buffy.\n</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cCan\nI talk to you for a minute?\u201d TJ asked, twiddling his thumbs, barely looking at\nCyrus.</p><p>\u201cI\nwas actually just about to ask you the same thing,\u201d Cyrus replied, \u201cLet\u2019s go to\nAndi Shack. It\u2019s more private than\u2014\u201d he looked over at Buffy and Andi, who were\nstaring intently at the two boys, \u201chere,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\nled TJ to the backyard and into Andi Shack. \u201cIsn\u2019t Andi going to kill you for\nbeing here without her permission?\u201d TJ asked as he fumbled in the dark for a\nlight switch.</p><p>\u201cNot\nnecessarily,\u201d TJ looked up in confusion, \u201cIt depends on how this conversation\ngoes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nsee,\u201d</p><p>After\ncarefully moving pieces of art and art materials, the two sat down on a\ntattered bench covered in old paint.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nKira, huh?\u201d Cyrus started.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow what I said, Cy, but, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated,\nI got it,\u201d he paused, \u201cWhat you told me the other day, you were being serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, I was. I\u2019d never joke about that,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\nsmiled at TJ, but TJ\u2019s face was still full of worry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it?\u201d asked Cyrus.</p><p>TJ\nstared at Cyrus blankly for a few moments, \u201cI think you\u2019re really great, Cyrus,\u201d\nhis eyes shifted down to the floor, \u201cand I,\u201d TJ gulped.</p><p>\u201cTJ\nit\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to say anything you\u2019re not ready to say. My parents\nsay that\u2019s almost as bad as bottling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\nI kiss you at midnight?\u201d TJ interrupted, causing Cyrus to go pale, his eyes\nwider than an owl\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCan\nyou\u2014\u201d Cyrus trailed off, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cNever\nmind, it was a dumb question. You probably don\u2019t want to, anyway. I guess this\nconversation didn\u2019t go as well as Andi had hoped and we\u2019re probably dead meat,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeej,\u201d\nCyrus called, as he noticed TJ getting up to leave, \u201cyou can,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan?\u201d TJ said, turning around to face Cyrus, subconscious smiles creeping onto their\nfaces.</p><p>Cyrus\nsimply nodded and stood up to hold the other boy\u2019s hand, \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold. We\nshould go back inside,\u201d</p><p>They\nswitched off the light and went back into the house.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cBex,\nBowie! There\u2019s less than an hour left, set the food out in the living room!\u201d\nshouted Cece from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cComing,\nI\u2019m coming,\u201d Bowie pulled her up off the couch and gently pushed her towards\nthe kitchen, following not far behind.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink Cyrus and TJ made up,\u201d Bex told Bowie, eyeing the boys as they entered\nthe house.</p><p>\u201cWhy\ndo you invest yourself in the lives of thirteen-year-olds, Rebecca?\u201d questioned\nCece, handing each one a tray stacked with sandwiches and cake.</p><p>\u201cWhen\nwere TJ and Cyrus fighting?\u201d asked Bowie, walking out of the kitchen with his\ntrays as well as Bex\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsure Andi will be glad to know I pay more attention to her rambling than her\nown father,\u201d she replied, cheekily, taking the trays from Bowie and setting them\ndown on the coffee table.</p><p>The\nkids immediately took notice of the food and stampeded towards the table. An\nassortment of compliments towards Cece\u2019s were spoken by food-filled mouths.</p><p>***</p><p>With\nless than 2 minutes till the end of the year and a room full of satisfied\nstomachs and neighbourhood friendly music, the seven of them stood around the\nliving room. Bowie and Bex were already standing in the corner, ready for\nmidnight. Andi and Buffy were sitting on one side of the couch, somehow still eating\nthe remaining chips, as they waited for the countdown. Cece was just trying not\nto fall asleep but gave in and went upstairs after reminding the kids (including\nBex and Bowie) to clean up whatever mess they make. Cyrus was sitting next to\nBuffy, and TJ was sitting next to Cyrus. </p><p>The\nkids\u2019 conversation was a long, muffled noise to the outside listener, but as\nthe clock neared twelve, the chaos turned into a countdown. </p><p>\u201cTen,\nnine, eight, seven, six, five, four,\u201d Cyrus and TJ turned towards each other,\nbarely three inches apart. The rest of the room faded to a big blur. It was\njust the two of them and there was no going back now.</p><p>\u201cThree,\ntwo, one.\u201d</p><p>As the\nrest cheered, \u201cHappy New Year!\u201d TJ had his hands gripped around Cyrus\u2019 waist,\nand Cyrus\u2019 hands were entangled in the other boy\u2019s hair. Their eyes were closed\ntight, lips together, indifferent to the world. </p><p>The\nboys pulled away at the same time, when they realised the cheering had stopped.\nThey opened their eyes to four people staring at them in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThey\n<i>really</i> made up, huh?\u201d added Bowie,\nbreaking the silence. The rest chuckled as the new year began.</p><p>***</p><p>The\nnext morning, the four kids went to The Spoon to meet up with Jonah. </p><p>\u201cI apparently\nmissed a lot,\u201d Jonah stated, watching Cyrus and TJ walk in, hand in hand.</p><p>\u201cNot\nmuch,\u201d Cyrus chuckled and turned to TJ, who was trying to refrain from smiling.</p><p>\u201cBaby\ntaters?\u201d Amber asked, approaching the table, \u201cand happy new year, by the way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirstly,\nis that even a question, and secondly, you too, Ambs,\u201d Andi blushed.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nthat\u2019s baby taters and,\u201d her expression turned grim, \u201cTJ, Kira came by earlier\nasking for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\nKippen, you got a second?\u201d It was Kira. Again.</p><p>TJ\nstood up, \u201cAnything you want to say to me, you can say in front of them,\u201d Amber\nslowly backed away.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d\nKira looked around the table, \u201cfine. I\u2019m sorry. What I did to you was vindictive\nand, if I\u2019m being honest, I mostly did it to get back at Buffy,\u201d she mouths \u2018sorry\u2019\nto Buffy, \u201cIt was wrong. I saw TJ and thought I had a chance but then Cyrus came\nalong, and I figured, \u2018why not?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nstill made two people feel badly about themselves just for being who they were,\u201d\nretorted Buffy.</p><p>\u201cSometimes\nthere\u2019s a nice person trying to get out. I guess I still haven\u2019t figured out\nhow to do that. My parents told my neighbours what I told Buffy. I didn\u2019t\nrealise how much that would hurt someone. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She walked out of the\ndiner without a second glance. </p><p>\u201cWell,\nat least she knows how to apologise unlike <i>some\n</i>of us,\u201d Buffy joked.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d\nTJ responded, \u201cI can say\u2014\"</p><p>\u201cTeej,\u201d\nCyrus gestured at his hands under the table. He put up three fingers, then two,\nthen one, and gave TJ a quick kiss on the lips before changing the conversation,\n\u201cSo, Andi. Amber, huh?\u201d</p>",

Wow, Buffy, you\u2019ve gone soft,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\nKira, I\u2019m trying to be reasonable but you\u2019re testing my patience.

Because it seemed like\nmore than that to me. Is that really what you want for Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>The\nargument falls silent.

We haven\u2019t spoken since he apologised for the costume, and I don\u2019t know\nhow to talk to him after what he told Buffy and me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout\nthat, what happened? You guys never told me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nisn\u2019t really our story to tell. He\u2019ll tell you when he\u2019s ready. But since he\nsaid that, I figured he\u2019d break up with Kira. He even told me he would, but I guess\nKira\u2019s still got him wrapped around her finger,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsure he has a good reason. I didn\u2019t like TJ for a long time, but I\u2019ve seen the\nway he acts around you. Something lights up in him, Cy. He makes you happy, and\nI think you make him happy, too,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nreally think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndo,\u201d</p><p>Andi\nwas interrupted by Buffy storming back into the house.

She did leave, though,\u201d</p><p>TJ\nbreathed a sigh of relief, prompting Buffy to urge him to talk to Cyrus, \u201cI\nknow you like him,\u201d she gestured towards the kitchen, where Cyrus and Andi were\nstill peering at the other boy, \u201cyou should talk to him,\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nright, Driscoll. For once, I actually mean it,\u201d TJ stood up halfway but sat\nback down, \u201cBut I have no idea what to say,\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nsay \u2018hi\u2019 and see what happens. You two have never had trouble finding things to\ntalk about before,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nturns out, we\u2019re a lot alike,\u201d</p><p>TJ\nnodded and stood up all the way.

I\u2019d never joke about that,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\nsmiled at TJ, but TJ\u2019s face was still full of worry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it?\u201d asked Cyrus.</p><p>TJ\nstared at Cyrus blankly for a few moments, \u201cI think you\u2019re really great, Cyrus,\u201d\nhis eyes shifted down to the floor, \u201cand I,\u201d TJ gulped.</p><p>\u201cTJ\nit\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to say anything you\u2019re not ready to say. My parents\nsay that\u2019s almost as bad as bottling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\nI kiss you at midnight?\u201d TJ interrupted, causing Cyrus to go pale, his eyes\nwider than an owl\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCan\nyou\u2014\u201d Cyrus trailed off, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cNever\nmind, it was a dumb question. You probably don\u2019t want to, anyway. I guess this\nconversation didn\u2019t go as well as Andi had hoped and we\u2019re probably dead meat,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeej,\u201d\nCyrus called, as he noticed TJ getting up to leave, \u201cyou can,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan?\u201d TJ said, turning around to face Cyrus, subconscious smiles creeping onto their\nfaces.</p><p>Cyrus\nsimply nodded and stood up to hold the other boy\u2019s hand, \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold. We\nshould go back inside,\u201d</p><p>They\nswitched off the light and went back into the house.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cBex,\nBowie! There\u2019s less than an hour left, set the food out in the living room!\u201d\nshouted Cece from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cComing,\nI\u2019m coming,\u201d Bowie pulled her up off the couch and gently pushed her towards\nthe kitchen, following not far behind.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink Cyrus and TJ made up,\u201d Bex told Bowie, eyeing the boys as they entered\nthe house.</p><p>\u201cWhy\ndo you invest yourself in the lives of thirteen-year-olds, Rebecca?\u201d questioned\nCece, handing each one a tray stacked with sandwiches and cake.</p><p>\u201cWhen\nwere TJ and Cyrus fighting?\u201d asked Bowie, walking out of the kitchen with his\ntrays as well as Bex\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsure Andi will be glad to know I pay more attention to her rambling than her\nown father,\u201d she replied, cheekily, taking the trays from Bowie and setting them\ndown on the coffee table.</p><p>The\nkids immediately took notice of the food and stampeded towards the table. An\nassortment of compliments towards Cece\u2019s were spoken by food-filled mouths.</p><p>***</p><p>With\nless than 2 minutes till the end of the year and a room full of satisfied\nstomachs and neighbourhood friendly music, the seven of them stood around the\nliving room. Bowie and Bex were already standing in the corner, ready for\nmidnight. Andi and Buffy were sitting on one side of the couch, somehow still eating\nthe remaining chips, as they waited for the countdown. Cece was just trying not\nto fall asleep but gave in and went upstairs after reminding the kids (including\nBex and Bowie) to clean up whatever mess they make. Cyrus was sitting next to\nBuffy, and TJ was sitting next to Cyrus. </p><p>The\nkids\u2019 conversation was a long, muffled noise to the outside listener, but as\nthe clock neared twelve, the chaos turned into a countdown. </p><p>\u201cTen,\nnine, eight, seven, six, five, four,\u201d Cyrus and TJ turned towards each other,\nbarely three inches apart. The rest of the room faded to a big blur. It was\njust the two of them and there was no going back now.</p><p>\u201cThree,\ntwo, one.\u201d</p><p>As the\nrest cheered, \u201cHappy New Year!\u201d TJ had his hands gripped around Cyrus\u2019 waist,\nand Cyrus\u2019 hands were entangled in the other boy\u2019s hair. Their eyes were closed\ntight, lips together, indifferent to the world. </p><p>The\nboys pulled away at the same time, when they realised the cheering had stopped.\nThey opened their eyes to four people staring at them in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThey\n<i>really</i> made up, huh?\u201d added Bowie,\nbreaking the silence. The rest chuckled as the new year began.</p><p>***</p><p>The\nnext morning, the four kids went to The Spoon to meet up with Jonah. </p><p>\u201cI apparently\nmissed a lot,\u201d Jonah stated, watching Cyrus and TJ walk in, hand in hand.</p><p>\u201cNot\nmuch,\u201d Cyrus chuckled and turned to TJ, who was trying to refrain from smiling.</p><p>\u201cBaby\ntaters?\u201d Amber asked, approaching the table, \u201cand happy new year, by the way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirstly,\nis that even a question, and secondly, you too, Ambs,\u201d Andi blushed.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nthat\u2019s baby taters and,\u201d her expression turned grim, \u201cTJ, Kira came by earlier\nasking for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\nKippen, you got a second?\u201d It was Kira. Again.</p><p>TJ\nstood up, \u201cAnything you want to say to me, you can say in front of them,\u201d Amber\nslowly backed away.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d\nKira looked around the table, \u201cfine. I\u2019m sorry. What I did to you was vindictive\nand, if I\u2019m being honest, I mostly did it to get back at Buffy,\u201d she mouths \u2018sorry\u2019\nto Buffy, \u201cIt was wrong. I saw TJ and thought I had a chance but then Cyrus came\nalong, and I figured, \u2018why not?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nstill made two people feel badly about themselves just for being who they were,\u201d\nretorted Buffy.</p><p>\u201cSometimes\nthere\u2019s a nice person trying to get out. I guess I still haven\u2019t figured out\nhow to do that. My parents told my neighbours what I told Buffy. I didn\u2019t\nrealise how much that would hurt someone. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She walked out of the\ndiner without a second glance. </p><p>\u201cWell,\nat least she knows how to apologise unlike <i>some\n</i>of us,\u201d Buffy joked.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d\nTJ responded, \u201cI can say\u2014\"</p><p>\u201cTeej,\u201d\nCyrus gestured at his hands under the table. He put up three fingers, then two,\nthen one, and gave TJ a quick kiss on the lips before changing the conversation,\n\u201cSo, Andi. Amber, huh?\u201d</p>",

I guess this\nconversation didn&rsquo;t go as well as Andi had hoped and we&rsquo;re probably dead meat,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Teej,&rdquo;\nCyrus called, as he noticed TJ getting up to leave, &ldquo;you can,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ncan?&rdquo; TJ said, turning around to face Cyrus, subconscious smiles creeping onto their\nfaces.</p><p>Cyrus\nsimply nodded and stood up to hold the other boy&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting cold. We\nshould go back inside,&rdquo;</p><p>They\nswitched off the light and went back into the house.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Bex,\nBowie! There&rsquo;s less than an hour left, set the food out in the living room!&rdquo;\nshouted Cece from the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Coming,\nI&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; Bowie pulled her up off the couch and gently pushed her towards\nthe kitchen, following not far behind.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nthink Cyrus and TJ made up,&rdquo; Bex told Bowie, eyeing the boys as they entered\nthe house.</p><p>&ldquo;Why\ndo you invest yourself in the lives of thirteen-year-olds, Rebecca?&rdquo; questioned\nCece, handing each one a tray stacked with sandwiches and cake.</p><p>&ldquo;When\nwere TJ and Cyrus fighting?&rdquo; asked Bowie, walking out of the kitchen with his\ntrays as well as Bex&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsure Andi will be glad to know I pay more attention to her rambling than her\nown father,&rdquo; she replied, cheekily, taking the trays from Bowie and setting them\ndown on the coffee table.</p><p>The\nkids immediately took notice of the food and stampeded towards the table. An\nassortment of compliments towards Cece&rsquo;s were spoken by food-filled mouths.</p><p>***</p><p>With\nless than 2 minutes till the end of the year and a room full of satisfied\nstomachs and neighbourhood friendly music, the seven of them stood around the\nliving room. Bowie and Bex were already standing in the corner, ready for\nmidnight. Andi and Buffy were sitting on one side of the couch, somehow still eating\nthe remaining chips, as they waited for the countdown. Cece was just trying not\nto fall asleep but gave in and went upstairs after reminding the kids (including\nBex and Bowie) to clean up whatever mess they make. Cyrus was sitting next to\nBuffy, and TJ was sitting next to Cyrus. </p><p>The\nkids&rsquo; conversation was a long, muffled noise to the outside listener, but as\nthe clock neared twelve, the chaos turned into a countdown. </p><p>&ldquo;Ten,\nnine, eight, seven, six, five, four,&rdquo; Cyrus and TJ turned towards each other,\nbarely three inches apart. The rest of the room faded to a big blur. It was\njust the two of them and there was no going back now.</p><p>&ldquo;Three,\ntwo, one.&rdquo;</p><p>As the\nrest cheered, &ldquo;Happy New Year!&rdquo; TJ had his hands gripped around Cyrus&rsquo; waist,\nand Cyrus&rsquo; hands were entangled in the other boy&rsquo;s hair. Their eyes were closed\ntight, lips together, indifferent to the world. </p><p>The\nboys pulled away at the same time, when they realised the cheering had stopped.\nThey opened their eyes to four people staring at them in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;They\n<i>really</i> made up, huh?&rdquo; added Bowie,\nbreaking the silence. The rest chuckled as the new year began.</p><p>***</p><p>The\nnext morning, the four kids went to The Spoon to meet up with Jonah. </p><p>&ldquo;I apparently\nmissed a lot,&rdquo; Jonah stated, watching Cyrus and TJ walk in, hand in hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Not\nmuch,&rdquo; Cyrus chuckled and turned to TJ, who was trying to refrain from smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby\ntaters?&rdquo; Amber asked, approaching the table, &ldquo;and happy new year, by the way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Firstly,\nis that even a question, and secondly, you too, Ambs,&rdquo; Andi blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;So,\nthat&rsquo;s baby taters and,&rdquo; her expression turned grim, &ldquo;TJ, Kira came by earlier\nasking for&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nKippen, you got a second?&rdquo; It was Kira. Again.</p><p>TJ\nstood up, &ldquo;Anything you want to say to me, you can say in front of them,&rdquo; Amber\nslowly backed away.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;\nKira looked around the table, &ldquo;fine. I&rsquo;m sorry. What I did to you was vindictive\nand, if I&rsquo;m being honest, I mostly did it to get back at Buffy,&rdquo; she mouths &lsquo;sorry&rsquo;\nto Buffy, &ldquo;It was wrong. I saw TJ and thought I had a chance but then Cyrus came\nalong, and I figured, &lsquo;why not?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nstill made two people feel badly about themselves just for being who they were,&rdquo;\nretorted Buffy.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes\nthere&rsquo;s a nice person trying to get out. I guess I still haven&rsquo;t figured out\nhow to do that. My parents told my neighbours what I told Buffy. I didn&rsquo;t\nrealise how much that would hurt someone. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; She walked out of the\ndiner without a second glance. </p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nat least she knows how to apologise unlike <i>some\n</i>of us,&rdquo; Buffy joked.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;\nTJ responded, &ldquo;I can say&mdash;\"</p><p>&ldquo;Teej,&rdquo;\nCyrus gestured at his hands under the table. He put up three fingers, then two,\nthen one, and gave TJ a quick kiss on the lips before changing the conversation,\n&ldquo;So, Andi. Amber, huh?&rdquo;</p>",

But, Bex and Bowie are\nstill Bex and Bowie. Anyway, she had other things to think about. It was T-minus\n54 minutes until the guests were to arrive and the house still wasn&rsquo;t ready.\nCece was out doing some last-minute donations she missed out on during Christmas,\nAndi was decorating the living room, and Bex was currently lifting herself off\nthe couch to get more chips (for herself <i>and</i>\nthe party) with Bowie.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>T-minus\n3 minutes and everything looked, as Andi said, &ldquo;Just about ready,&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A\nplayful knock came at the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Buffy and Cyrus, I&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo; Andi called\nto her family as she ran to the door.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hi,\nAlex, right?&rdquo; said Kira, smiling, as she interlocked hands with a deadpanned\nTJ.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uh,\nit&rsquo;s Andi, actually,&rdquo; Andi&rsquo;s eyebrows furrowed, &ldquo;come in.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
