I finished up the new season of \u201cLuke Cage\u201d this past weekend, and since then I\u2019ve been thinking about all the Marvel/Netflix shows and how, overall, they\u2019ve done a fantastic job adding to the Marvel universe we know and love. Some of the best superhero storytelling today is being done on the small screen, and Marvel/Netflix\u2019s partnership is a true standout.</p>\n<p>I remember starting the very first Marvel/Netflix show, \u201cDaredevil,\u201d back in 2015 and wondering how it would compare to the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.

Some, like Matt and Luke, are able to claim the moral high ground as superheroes (at least at first), while others, like Punisher, tend more towards the antihero end of the spectrum. But each are fascinating in their own way, and the shows have their own unique tone and themes. Perhaps that\u2019s why, at least to me, the Marvel/Netflix team-up series, \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d didn\u2019t work as well; it lost the unique flavor that made each of the individual shows stand out.</p>\n<p>Now, some of these individual series are more compelling than others. I never finished \u201cIron Fist,\u201d and I felt the back half of \u201cDaredevil\u201d season 2 suffered after the Punisher\u2019s arc on that show wrapped up. I tried the first episode of \u201cJessica Jones\u201d season 2, but it didn\u2019t grab me like the first season did. Maybe I need to give it another shot.</p>\n<p>Still, there\u2019s some really excellent character development in these shows, and not just for the heroes. The villains are just as fascinating (and in some cases, even more fascinating!) than the heroes themselves.</p>\n<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been criticized in the past for some of its more lackluster villains, who are more of an obstacle for the hero to overcome than a fully realized character. That\u2019s why Wilson Fisk/Kingpin, the main villain in \u201cDaredevil\u201d season 1, felt like such a revelation. He was definitely a bad guy, and I wasn\u2019t really sorry to see him go to prison. However, the show made him a compelling villain by giving him flashes of humanity, including a surprisingly tender and genuine relationship with his girlfriend, Vanessa. He was by no means a stereotypical \u201cmustache-twirling\u201d villain.</p>\n<p>For the most part, all the Marvel/Netflix shows have followed that trend. By showing us the flaws in the heroes and the humanity in the villains, the shows become more real and thought-provoking. All the characters have hurts that haunt them.</p>\n<p>Due to the shows\u2019 format, they\u2019re able to tell darker stories than the MCU is able to. I\u2019m okay with that, really. I don\u2019t necessarily want/need the MCU to be gritty; I like that they are family films that are accessible to a wide audience. But it\u2019s nice to see some heavier superhero storytelling as well.</p>\n<p>Although these shows work on a surface level as compelling action/dramas, there are some really relevant themes to chew on as well. When I first heard about \u201cThe Punisher\u201d series, I was excited, because I loved Jon Bernthal\u2019s performance as the character in \u201cDaredevil\u201d season 2. However, I was a little worried about how they would handle a character centered around guns and violence, especially with all the tragic real-life headlines we continue to see. Thankfully, they approached the subject with sensitivity and nuance. The show also touched on another important issue: what happens to veterans after they return from combat.</p>\n<p>\u201cJessica Jones\u201d addressed domestic violence and abuse, \u201cLuke Cage\u201d tackled racism, and so on. I hope that the fans who watch these shows are inspired to have real-life conversations about these issues. That, I think, is the real power of entertainment: to get us to look at the world through a different lens than our own. In our increasingly politically-charged world, I think pop culture has a real opportunity to break down barriers and tell stories that have the power to bring real-world change.</p>\n<p>On a lighter note, the shows\u2019 practical effects and well-choreographed fight scenes are also a nice change of pace from CGI-heavy blockbusters (even though if you know me, you know that I love big-budget special effects). \ud83d\ude42 And the shows also use music really effectively to help tell the story, particularly \u201cLuke Cage.\u201d</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t tried any of these shows yet, I\u2019d highly recommend them. I know some fans who\u2019ve watched all of them, and others who have tried a couple and just stuck with their favorites. Although as previously mentioned, there have been a few bumps along the way, overall the Marvel/Netflix partnership has definitely been a winning one.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Now, Mariah is a truly terrible person. The former politician has committed horrible crimes during her quest for power, and by the end of the season, I&rsquo;m sure most viewers would agree that she deserves all the bad things coming to her.</p>\n<p>And yet&hellip;in this one moment, where she reveals a painful emotional scar from her past, we do genuinely pity her. She remains a terrible person, but the tragedy she experienced is real and heartbreaking, and you can&rsquo;t help but imagine the better person she could have become if she&rsquo;d grown up in better circumstances.</p>\n<p>Nuanced characters like Mariah Dillard is one of the key strengths shared by the Marvel/Netflix superhero shows (well, most of them, at least). I finished up the new season of &ldquo;Luke Cage&rdquo; this past weekend, and since then I&rsquo;ve been thinking about all the Marvel/Netflix shows and how, overall, they&rsquo;ve done a fantastic job adding to the Marvel universe we know and love. Some of the best superhero storytelling today is being done on the small screen, and Marvel/Netflix&rsquo;s partnership is a true standout.</p>\n<p>I remember starting the very first Marvel/Netflix show, &ldquo;Daredevil,&rdquo; back in 2015 and wondering how it would compare to the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Sometimes it&rsquo;s tough to capture that same epic, sweeping feel on a smaller screen with a smaller budget. Thankfully, the Marvel/Netflix shows don&rsquo;t try to replicate what we&rsquo;re seeing in the MCU. Instead, they use their smaller scale to their advantage. The whole world isn&rsquo;t in peril; maybe it&rsquo;s just one neighborhood in New York City. But through this more narrow focus, we have a chance to dive really deeply into a lineup of fascinating heroes AND villains.</p>\n<p>Matt Murdock/Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Danny Rand/Iron Fist, and Frank Castle/Punisher are all completely different people. Some, like Matt and Luke, are able to claim the moral high ground as superheroes (at least at first), while others, like Punisher, tend more towards the antihero end of the spectrum. But each are fascinating in their own way, and the shows have their own unique tone and themes. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why, at least to me, the Marvel/Netflix team-up series, &ldquo;The Defenders,&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t work as well; it lost the unique flavor that made each of the individual shows stand out.</p>\n<p>Now, some of these individual series are more compelling than others.

Also having a Thor marathon reminded me of my love for Loki.</p><p><a href=\"http://Fandomnerdsarecool.tumblr.com/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></p><hr><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was a quiet morning on Midgard. \u00a0These were the mornings that you loved the most. It sometimes tricked you into thinking you were back at Alfheim. \u00a0But maybe that had something to due with the way you tampered with the atmosphere. The little cottage you lived in was in a clearing in the middle of a forest; slightly overgrown with a myriad (myriad, nice) of vibrant wild flowers, along with a lovely little creek that flowed behind your house. Walking into the kitchen, you watered your plants while waiting for your coffee to brew. You heard the door open, but didn\u2019t move since you knew who it was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m in the kitchen darling!\u201d You heard footsteps approach you, then felt arms wrap around your waist. \u201cYou\u2019re home earlier than I thought you would be,\u201d You told Loki as you turned your head to kiss his cheek. He gave a slightly pained grunt, so you turned around to look at his face. \u201cOh love,\u201d You sighed in reference to the little cuts and bruises scattered about his face. Gently, you moved your hand to cup his face. You focused on the light fluttering in through the window over the sink, feeling it flow through your being. Concentrating on his wounds, you felt the light transfer through your fingers, filtering the healing power to his cuts. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few seconds he turned his face to kiss your palm. \u201cIt amazes me how you do that,\u201d his lips tickled as he spoke against your hand. Your hand dropped and you turned back around to pour two cups of coffee. Handing one to him, you started walking outside with him trailing behind you. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The day was turning out to be beautiful, not too hot and not too cold. All the flowers in your backyard were in full bloom. Most of them Midgardian wild flowers, but some from Alfheim and Asgard were mixed in. They were a piece of home away from home, and looked beautiful in the bouquets you assembled. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo my elf queen, what are your plans for the day?\u201d Loki asked as you started picking the colorful plants.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pointed to an oak tree nearby, \u201cSit down and find out.\u201d He offered his signature smirk and sat with his back against the tree.

It sometimes tricked you into thinking you were back at Alfheim. \u00a0But maybe that had something to due with the way you tampered with the atmosphere. The little cottage you lived in was in a clearing in the middle of a forest; slightly overgrown with a myriad (myriad, nice) of vibrant wild flowers, along with a lovely little creek that flowed behind your house. Walking into the kitchen, you watered your plants while waiting for your coffee to brew. You heard the door open, but didn\u2019t move since you knew who it was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m in the kitchen darling!\u201d You heard footsteps approach you, then felt arms wrap around your waist. \u201cYou\u2019re home earlier than I thought you would be,\u201d You told Loki as you turned your head to kiss his cheek. He gave a slightly pained grunt, so you turned around to look at his face. \u201cOh love,\u201d You sighed in reference to the little cuts and bruises scattered about his face. Gently, you moved your hand to cup his face. You focused on the light fluttering in through the window over the sink, feeling it flow through your being. Concentrating on his wounds, you felt the light transfer through your fingers, filtering the healing power to his cuts. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few seconds he turned his face to kiss your palm. \u201cIt amazes me how you do that,\u201d his lips tickled as he spoke against your hand. Your hand dropped and you turned back around to pour two cups of coffee. Handing one to him, you started walking outside with him trailing behind you. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The day was turning out to be beautiful, not too hot and not too cold.
