Til the next chapter.</p><p>Warning- angst , violence </p><p>Episode- 8x03</p><p>Pairing- Podrick Payne</p><p>- </p><p>I felt fear. Desperation. Those things were coming. Seeing the Unsullied and the Dothraki waiting for the dead was terrifying to see. They could attack at any moment. It was dark to see anything. They had to pay attention to the noise they would make. I passed by the Men of Vale and saw Podrick standing there frontline with Ser brienne at his side. I met his gaze for a second before I flew past him. His face in awe as he saw Rheagal and me fly by. Daenerys and me had to wait for the sign to light the trench. I wanted to be down there to fight alongside with them but Jon had advised me to be flying. </p><p>We had to wait now for the signal. It feels like time was going slower. Waiting up here felt like we\u2019ve been here for days. Daenerys and me couldn\u2019t find anything to say to one another. Nothing felt right to say at the moment. Nothing could make us feel better. We were both nervous and scared. I bit at the bottom of my lip as stood there waiting. There was a flicker of fire down by where the Dothraki were. I took a step closer to get a better view and saw as the flicker became into a wave of fire. It seemed that they had their swords lit up with fire. I looked over at Daenerys and she looked at me. We were both confused but amazed by the way it looked. </p><p>We stood there nervously as they started charging into the dark night. I felt a slither of hope as their faints screams could be heard as they charged with their flaming swords. But the slither of hope i had completly shattered. I reached for Daenerys hand. I could feel the tension coming from her and me. She looked terrified as she the fire begin to go out. I could feel my heart beat faster as I saw the fire of the swords was slowly going out. I swallowed thickly as I looked over seeing the fire go out in a faster rate. Soon it was dark again nothing could be seen anymore. They were all gone. Daenerys tightened her grip around my hand Before letting go completly of my hand. She turned her back and headed for drogon. I stopped  her by grabbing onto her wrist. </p><p>\u201cWe have to wait.\u201d I insisted. She just pulled her hand off my grasp. </p><p>\u201cThe dead are already here.\u201d She spat before getting on drogon. I looked down one last time hesitant to follow her but she was right. We needed to do something. Help them. I got on Rheagal and we flew off following Daenerys and drogon. We flew lower to get a better view of down below. My eyes went wide as I saw them.Their was so many of them. It was terrifying. </p><p>\u2018Dracarys!\u2019 Instructed Rheagal. We flew in line to get as many as we could. We turned and followed behind Daenerys. We fired down at thousands of dead that were running toward the others. I looked back and could see them fighting. It was killing me inside not to get off and help them but I knew that this was also good. This gave them an edge to keep them all from getting swarmed by the dead. We did another turn and fired again. We flew past and I turned my head saw what looked to be the generals of some kind. They were on horses. I turned to get better view to see if I could see dead Viserion or the night king. But we were soon pushed to side as fast winds hit us. I grabbed onto Rheagal tightly so I wouldn\u2019t lose my grip and fall to my death. </p><p>The snow would hit my face making it sting. I tried to cover my face with one hand to try and keep the wind and the snow from hitting my face. It was hard to see as the blizzard was soon on us. I tried squinting but it would be diffcult to look straight ahead. I didn\u2019t know where we were going. The damned Blizzard making it impossible to see. I turned to try and follow where we came from to see if that would help but the winds would push Rheagal making it hard for him to fly and see as well. Suddenly he was hitting something. I grabbed on tighter and looked down and saw he was hitting trees with his wings. I guided him back up so we weren\u2019t hitting any trees anymore. I tried so hard to look straight ahead but all I could see was the snow that was coming straight ahead. Suddenly we crashed into something. We were violently thrown back I gripped on and when I looked overhead I saw Drogon. We were flying side to side now trying to find a way out of the storm. I flew up and Daenerys followed. We could see the moon and the stars that were lighting up the blizzard clouds below. If we weren\u2019t in danger I would think this was the prettiest thing I\u2019ve seen. But we had no time for that now. </p><p>I dove down into the blizzard to try and see if they were giving the signal to light the trench but I couldn\u2019t see anything. I looked over my shoulder often to try and see if I would get a glimpse of anything but all I saw was darkness. We flew low and I noticed that Daenerys wasn\u2019t by me anymore. I kept my eyes low to try and see anything and to also avoid being hit by the snow that would hit my face. Finally I saw the gods wood tree and landed on the wall to try and get a better view of everything. I also wanted to see if I could see the night king. I noticed that the trench was not lit yet and if they were giving a signal then Daenerys wouldn\u2019t see it with the storm. I decided I was going to light it because mostly likely then not they were probably giving the signal. But before I could fly off i was blinded by the fire that lit up. I opened my eyes and saw the trench being lit. </p><p>I heard footsteps approach I turned my head and saw Jon approach. His face was covered with blood and grime. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked him. He came closer to Rheagal. </p><p>\u201cI was going to ask the same question to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe blizzard was making it hard to see so I tried to get a better view and I was about to light the trench but I see that it somehow got lit without the help of Rheagal or drogon.\u201d I said furrowed my eyebrows in confusion. I couldn\u2019t really focus on him. The thoughts my people being in danger and needing help never leaves my head. The need of being there is killing me inside. I get off the Rheagal and Jon looks at me  confused. \u201cGet on im going down there.\u201d He does answer instead he still has the confused face.</p><p>\u201cWhy? No stay on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve been down there but you stopped me. Also you know about the night king more then me. Get on. And kill that fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Jon said as he got on Rheagal. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you after.\u201d I say as give him a small wave  before turning to leave. My walk soon turned into a run to get to the gate as fast as I could. I went down steps and past some doors killing a few wights on my way there. Finally reaching the  center. I found myself next to Ser Davos and Arya  and saw that he was looking at something. I followed his gaze and saw the wights. They were throwing themselves to the fire. They were killing themselves. I paid close attention as more followed and began to stack up ontop of one another. My eyes went wide at the realization of what they were doing. </p><p>\u201cMAN THE WALLS!\u201d I yelled warning everyone below. The wights were throwing themselves on one another and making bridges to cross past the fire. I looked over the courtyard and my  eye caught podrick running up to one of the walls. A sigh of relief passed my lips when I saw him. He was still alive. Before I knew my feet were taking me to the wall where he was heading for.</p><p>I was on my way there but was stopped by sound of growling coming from below. I looked down the wall and saw the wights piling on top of one another. I got my spear from its sheath that was hanging in my back. In the corner of my eye I noticed Greyworm. We made quick eye contact and nodded at one another. </p><p>I was breathing hard from the running. My heart felt like it beat faster as their screeches became louder as they got closer and closer. They would make it to the top one by one making it easier for us to kill them. But soon they spread and started to make it diffcult for us to kill them because of how many were making it. One was running to my side so I spun and leaned in and stabbed him in the head. Another get on and was coming to me but I tossed my spear to my other hand and stabbed it. Two started running my way from the corner of my eye I saw one come from the side. I killed the one to the side first and then threw one of my daggers to the left one. I ran to right one and jumped up and stabbed it down. I got my dagger then spun to kill one behind me. The sound of a man screaming for help caught my attention. I turned my head and saw that he was being dragged down. I ran to his side but as soon as I was about to help him he was pulled down into the pile of wights. </p><p>I blinked repeatedly at the sight. It was horrifying to see. But there was no time to feel bad. I killed two wights that get on and before I could turn one took me down to the ground. I held my spear high trying to push it off and to try and avoid it from stabbing me. I held my spear up with hand and with the other hand I struggled to get my dagger. Another wight get on top making it harder for me keep it held up with one hand. Instinctly I used both hands to keep them off. I was struggling to keep them off so I used my feet and kicked them off. One went over the wall and one hit the ground. I used my spear and killed and then flipped my spear to and killed another one with the other end of the spear. From the corner of my eye I saw Greyworm starting to get cornered so I picked up my pace and headed to him. Killing the wights that were in the way. When I reached him I pulled one off and swung at his head. I pulled another and managed to give Greyworm space to get out. He nodded and I Before I could do anything else he pushed me out of the way. A lot of them were going his way. I was about to help him but then a lot of wights were running my way. </p><p>I kept stepping back. Killing as many as I could but more kept coming. I took another step until my back hit the railing. I looked over my shoulder and saw the ground. I got my dagger and killed the ones that came to my side and I used the spear to kill those who came toward me. They were beginning to pile making it harder for me to move and harder to kill those coming my way. </p><p>\u201cAhhh.\u201d I cried as I felt a sudden pain on my arm. I quickly looked at it and saw I that I got caught by the wights sword. I glared at it and then kicked it with all my strength making it fall back into another wight. I kept killing as much as I could. I heard the light noises of the railing begin to break as I leaned further and further. I flipped my spear killing the wights with both ends. It seemed that I was beginning to clear them off until one ran my way I quickly speared it in the neck but when I did that I didn\u2019t notice the one that came to my side. </p><p>\u201cOomph.\u201d Is all I managed to say as it tackled me down hard and went through the broken railing.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p>",

Til the next chapter.</p><p>Warning- angst , violence </p><p>Episode- 8x03</p><p>Pairing- Podrick Payne</p><p>- </p><p>I felt fear. Desperation. Those things were coming. Seeing the Unsullied and the Dothraki waiting for the dead was terrifying to see. They could attack at any moment. It was dark to see anything. They had to pay attention to the noise they would make. I passed by the Men of Vale and saw Podrick standing there frontline with Ser brienne at his side. I met his gaze for a second before I flew past him. His face in awe as he saw Rheagal and me fly by. Daenerys and me had to wait for the sign to light the trench. I wanted to be down there to fight alongside with them but Jon had advised me to be flying. </p><p>We had to wait now for the signal. It feels like time was going slower. Waiting up here felt like we\u2019ve been here for days. Daenerys and me couldn\u2019t find anything to say to one another. Nothing felt right to say at the moment. Nothing could make us feel better. We were both nervous and scared. I bit at the bottom of my lip as stood there waiting. There was a flicker of fire down by where the Dothraki were. I took a step closer to get a better view and saw as the flicker became into a wave of fire. It seemed that they had their swords lit up with fire. I looked over at Daenerys and she looked at me. We were both confused but amazed by the way it looked. </p><p>We stood there nervously as they started charging into the dark night. I felt a slither of hope as their faints screams could be heard as they charged with their flaming swords. But the slither of hope i had completly shattered. I reached for Daenerys hand. I could feel the tension coming from her and me. She looked terrified as she the fire begin to go out. I could feel my heart beat faster as I saw the fire of the swords was slowly going out. I swallowed thickly as I looked over seeing the fire go out in a faster rate. Soon it was dark again nothing could be seen anymore. They were all gone. Daenerys tightened her grip around my hand Before letting go completly of my hand. She turned her back and headed for drogon. I stopped  her by grabbing onto her wrist. </p><p>\u201cWe have to wait.\u201d I insisted. She just pulled her hand off my grasp. </p><p>\u201cThe dead are already here.\u201d She spat before getting on drogon. I looked down one last time hesitant to follow her but she was right. We needed to do something. Help them. I got on Rheagal and we flew off following Daenerys and drogon. We flew lower to get a better view of down below. My eyes went wide as I saw them.Their was so many of them. It was terrifying. </p><p>\u2018Dracarys!\u2019 Instructed Rheagal. We flew in line to get as many as we could. We turned and followed behind Daenerys. We fired down at thousands of dead that were running toward the others. I looked back and could see them fighting. It was killing me inside not to get off and help them but I knew that this was also good. This gave them an edge to keep them all from getting swarmed by the dead. We did another turn and fired again. We flew past and I turned my head saw what looked to be the generals of some kind. They were on horses. I turned to get better view to see if I could see dead Viserion or the night king. But we were soon pushed to side as fast winds hit us. I grabbed onto Rheagal tightly so I wouldn\u2019t lose my grip and fall to my death. </p><p>The snow would hit my face making it sting. I tried to cover my face with one hand to try and keep the wind and the snow from hitting my face. It was hard to see as the blizzard was soon on us. I tried squinting but it would be diffcult to look straight ahead. I didn\u2019t know where we were going. The damned Blizzard making it impossible to see. I turned to try and follow where we came from to see if that would help but the winds would push Rheagal making it hard for him to fly and see as well. Suddenly he was hitting something. I grabbed on tighter and looked down and saw he was hitting trees with his wings. I guided him back up so we weren\u2019t hitting any trees anymore. I tried so hard to look straight ahead but all I could see was the snow that was coming straight ahead. Suddenly we crashed into something. We were violently thrown back I gripped on and when I looked overhead I saw Drogon. We were flying side to side now trying to find a way out of the storm. I flew up and Daenerys followed. We could see the moon and the stars that were lighting up the blizzard clouds below. If we weren\u2019t in danger I would think this was the prettiest thing I\u2019ve seen. But we had no time for that now. </p><p>I dove down into the blizzard to try and see if they were giving the signal to light the trench but I couldn\u2019t see anything. I looked over my shoulder often to try and see if I would get a glimpse of anything but all I saw was darkness. We flew low and I noticed that Daenerys wasn\u2019t by me anymore. I kept my eyes low to try and see anything and to also avoid being hit by the snow that would hit my face. Finally I saw the gods wood tree and landed on the wall to try and get a better view of everything. I also wanted to see if I could see the night king. I noticed that the trench was not lit yet and if they were giving a signal then Daenerys wouldn\u2019t see it with the storm. I decided I was going to light it because mostly likely then not they were probably giving the signal. But before I could fly off i was blinded by the fire that lit up. I opened my eyes and saw the trench being lit. </p><p>I heard footsteps approach I turned my head and saw Jon approach. His face was covered with blood and grime. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked him. He came closer to Rheagal. </p><p>\u201cI was going to ask the same question to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe blizzard was making it hard to see so I tried to get a better view and I was about to light the trench but I see that it somehow got lit without the help of Rheagal or drogon.\u201d I said furrowed my eyebrows in confusion. I couldn\u2019t really focus on him. The thoughts my people being in danger and needing help never leaves my head. The need of being there is killing me inside. I get off the Rheagal and Jon looks at me  confused. \u201cGet on im going down there.\u201d He does answer instead he still has the confused face.</p><p>\u201cWhy? No stay on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve been down there but you stopped me. Also you know about the night king more then me. Get on. And kill that fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Jon said as he got on Rheagal. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you after.\u201d I say as give him a small wave  before turning to leave. My walk soon turned into a run to get to the gate as fast as I could. I went down steps and past some doors killing a few wights on my way there. Finally reaching the  center. I found myself next to Ser Davos and Arya  and saw that he was looking at something. I followed his gaze and saw the wights. They were throwing themselves to the fire. They were killing themselves. I paid close attention as more followed and began to stack up ontop of one another. My eyes went wide at the realization of what they were doing. </p><p>\u201cMAN THE WALLS!\u201d I yelled warning everyone below. The wights were throwing themselves on one another and making bridges to cross past the fire. I looked over the courtyard and my  eye caught podrick running up to one of the walls. A sigh of relief passed my lips when I saw him. He was still alive. Before I knew my feet were taking me to the wall where he was heading for.</p><p>I was on my way there but was stopped by sound of growling coming from below. I looked down the wall and saw the wights piling on top of one another. I got my spear from its sheath that was hanging in my back. In the corner of my eye I noticed Greyworm. We made quick eye contact and nodded at one another. </p><p>I was breathing hard from the running. My heart felt like it beat faster as their screeches became louder as they got closer and closer. They would make it to the top one by one making it easier for us to kill them. But soon they spread and started to make it diffcult for us to kill them because of how many were making it. One was running to my side so I spun and leaned in and stabbed him in the head. Another get on and was coming to me but I tossed my spear to my other hand and stabbed it. Two started running my way from the corner of my eye I saw one come from the side. I killed the one to the side first and then threw one of my daggers to the left one. I ran to right one and jumped up and stabbed it down. I got my dagger then spun to kill one behind me. The sound of a man screaming for help caught my attention. I turned my head and saw that he was being dragged down. I ran to his side but as soon as I was about to help him he was pulled down into the pile of wights. </p><p>I blinked repeatedly at the sight. It was horrifying to see. But there was no time to feel bad. I killed two wights that get on and before I could turn one took me down to the ground. I held my spear high trying to push it off and to try and avoid it from stabbing me. I held my spear up with hand and with the other hand I struggled to get my dagger. Another wight get on top making it harder for me keep it held up with one hand. Instinctly I used both hands to keep them off. I was struggling to keep them off so I used my feet and kicked them off. One went over the wall and one hit the ground. I used my spear and killed and then flipped my spear to and killed another one with the other end of the spear. From the corner of my eye I saw Greyworm starting to get cornered so I picked up my pace and headed to him. Killing the wights that were in the way. When I reached him I pulled one off and swung at his head. I pulled another and managed to give Greyworm space to get out. He nodded and I Before I could do anything else he pushed me out of the way. A lot of them were going his way. I was about to help him but then a lot of wights were running my way. </p><p>I kept stepping back. Killing as many as I could but more kept coming. I took another step until my back hit the railing. I looked over my shoulder and saw the ground. I got my dagger and killed the ones that came to my side and I used the spear to kill those who came toward me. They were beginning to pile making it harder for me to move and harder to kill those coming my way. </p><p>\u201cAhhh.\u201d I cried as I felt a sudden pain on my arm. I quickly looked at it and saw I that I got caught by the wights sword. I glared at it and then kicked it with all my strength making it fall back into another wight. I kept killing as much as I could. I heard the light noises of the railing begin to break as I leaned further and further. I flipped my spear killing the wights with both ends. It seemed that I was beginning to clear them off until one ran my way I quickly speared it in the neck but when I did that I didn\u2019t notice the one that came to my side. </p><p>\u201cOomph.\u201d Is all I managed to say as it tackled me down hard and went through the broken railing.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></p>",

        "answer": "<p>I think we\u2019ve already gotten the answer to this question, at least partially. Jon came back to life because he was meant to LEAD the fight against the NK. Who else would have been able to accomplish all that Jon has done? Who else had the experience with the NK and enough clout in the realm to be taken seriously\u00a0 and enough power to call an army to fight besides Jon? The only people who knew about the threat besides Jon were people like Jon and the rest of the nights watch. Sam had no resources, no leadership skills, and no clout to lead this fight. Jon was literally the only person who could accomplish that feat of uniting the north and convincing them of the fight, preparing a large army for the fight, and even getting two dragons and two large armies from across the sea into the fight. Of course Jon didn\u2019t do it alone and his efforts were aided by Sansa\u2019s political clout and urgings, as well as Dany\u2019s decision to Join but the common denominator among all the allies was Jon Snow.\u00a0</p><p>The Vale came north for Sansa and stayed because of Jon, the wildlings fought because of\u00a0 years of hard earned respect and admiration for Jon who united them with the rest of the north. Dany came to the north because of Jon. Jamie Lannister came to the north because of Jon. Melisandre was only still alive and able to come in clutch in the battle because Jon spared her life. Jon Snow made the battle plans. Jon went to dragonstone pretty much alone knowing the risk and collected the weapons they needed to win. Tell me who else in the realm is was this integral to the fight with the NK?</p><p>If Jon had stayed dead all of his knowledge of the NK and the army of the dead would have died with him. The North never regains it\u2019s independance because Sansa more than likely stays in the clutches of Ramsey. Let\u2019s not forget that the only reason Sansa had an escape from Ramsey in the first place is because Jon was Lord Commander of the NW at the time. Theon explicitly told her to go to him because he knew Jon was in power. If Jon had stayed dead he never reunites with Sansa and Sansa never gets her safe haven. If Jon and Sansa never reunite the North stays under the Boltons and the NK easily runs through the north and the whole realm.\u00a0</p><p>So Jon didn\u2019t get the final kill but this idea that it somehow makes Jon pointless is weird to me because it deprives him of credit of all the many things that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Jon. He was THE vital piece of the puzzle the realm needed to save itself even if he didn\u2019t land the final blow. Even down to Arya\u2026.why did she come to Winterfell instead of going to KL to kill Cersei? If I remember correctly it was because she heard that Jon had taken Winterfell back. That\u2019s the ONLY reason she changed course. So if Jon had stayed dead, he never reunites with Sansa, they never take the north back, Arya never changes course and goes to Winterfell instead of KL so the realm NEVER GET\u2019S ITS ULTIMATE SAVIOR. No matter how you look at it Jon was vital. The north does not win without him and the realm is not saved without him. To me that\u2019s the answer to why he was brought back. I also think that it has to do with his fate as a Targaryen Prince but I really don\u2019t think the Lord of Light truly has a dog in that fight, his eyes were always on the war with the dead.\u00a0</p><p>Also, the idea that D&amp;D are just doing whatever with no real plan is contradicted by the fact that out of their own mouths they\u2019ve known that Arya was the one who was gonna kill the NK for YEARS. This isn\u2019t a random development that happened between the last two seasons. They both said they\u2019ve known for a long time now, for years that Arya was going to be the one to do it so all of her developments and Jon over the years were influenced by this fate. It\u2019s obvious that this is true based on the many call backs from Arya\u2019s SL over the years.\u00a0 They probably even knew it was Arya when they wrote Jon\u2019s resurrection. Just because a lot of people didn\u2019t guess it doesn\u2019t mean there was no groundwork put into the plot twist and it came out of nowhere. So yeah they have considered the story they\u2019ve been telling for years, the story they\u2019ve been telling for years lead up to this moment, a lot of y\u2019all just thought you were smarter than the show and had figured it all out.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I have no clue about how the SL will play out in the books. I\u2019ve seen it said on here that GRRM didn\u2019t tell D&amp;D that it was arya but they chose her even though I haven\u2019t seen a receipt to back that up yet. The only commentary I\u2019ve seem was both of them saying\u00a0\u201cwe knew it was gonna be arya for years\u201d which gives no indication about whether they were told or whether they picked, but either way, they had a plan in the works for a long time and they implemented that plan and was able to create a twist that fit the character and surprised the audience which sounds like effective writing to me.\u00a0</p>",

They both said they\u2019ve known for a long time now, for years that Arya was going to be the one to do it so all of her developments and Jon over the years were influenced by this fate. It\u2019s obvious that this is true based on the many call backs from Arya\u2019s SL over the years.\u00a0 They probably even knew it was Arya when they wrote Jon\u2019s resurrection. Just because a lot of people didn\u2019t guess it doesn\u2019t mean there was no groundwork put into the plot twist and it came out of nowhere. So yeah they have considered the story they\u2019ve been telling for years, the story they\u2019ve been telling for years lead up to this moment, a lot of y\u2019all just thought you were smarter than the show and had figured it all out.\u00a0<br></p><p>I have no clue about how the SL will play out in the books.

                "content": "<p>I think we&rsquo;ve already gotten the answer to this question, at least partially. Jon came back to life because he was meant to LEAD the fight against the NK. Who else would have been able to accomplish all that Jon has done? Who else had the experience with the NK and enough clout in the realm to be taken seriously&nbsp; and enough power to call an army to fight besides Jon? The only people who knew about the threat besides Jon were people like Jon and the rest of the nights watch. Sam had no resources, no leadership skills, and no clout to lead this fight. Jon was literally the only person who could accomplish that feat of uniting the north and convincing them of the fight, preparing a large army for the fight, and even getting two dragons and two large armies from across the sea into the fight. Of course Jon didn&rsquo;t do it alone and his efforts were aided by Sansa&rsquo;s political clout and urgings, as well as Dany&rsquo;s decision to Join but the common denominator among all the allies was Jon Snow.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vale came north for Sansa and stayed because of Jon, the wildlings fought because of&nbsp; years of hard earned respect and admiration for Jon who united them with the rest of the north. Dany came to the north because of Jon. Jamie Lannister came to the north because of Jon. Melisandre was only still alive and able to come in clutch in the battle because Jon spared her life. Jon Snow made the battle plans. Jon went to dragonstone pretty much alone knowing the risk and collected the weapons they needed to win. Tell me who else in the realm is was this integral to the fight with the NK?</p><p>If Jon had stayed dead all of his knowledge of the NK and the army of the dead would have died with him. The North never regains it&rsquo;s independance because Sansa more than likely stays in the clutches of Ramsey. Let&rsquo;s not forget that the only reason Sansa had an escape from Ramsey in the first place is because Jon was Lord Commander of the NW at the time. Theon explicitly told her to go to him because he knew Jon was in power. If Jon had stayed dead he never reunites with Sansa and Sansa never gets her safe haven. If Jon and Sansa never reunite the North stays under the Boltons and the NK easily runs through the north and the whole realm.&nbsp;</p><p>So Jon didn&rsquo;t get the final kill but this idea that it somehow makes Jon pointless is weird to me because it deprives him of credit of all the many things that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without Jon. He was THE vital piece of the puzzle the realm needed to save itself even if he didn&rsquo;t land the final blow. Even down to Arya&hellip;.why did she come to Winterfell instead of going to KL to kill Cersei? If I remember correctly it was because she heard that Jon had taken Winterfell back. That&rsquo;s the ONLY reason she changed course. So if Jon had stayed dead, he never reunites with Sansa, they never take the north back, Arya never changes course and goes to Winterfell instead of KL so the realm NEVER GET&rsquo;S ITS ULTIMATE SAVIOR. No matter how you look at it Jon was vital. The north does not win without him and the realm is not saved without him. To me that&rsquo;s the answer to why he was brought back.

        "answer": "<p>Hi, Anon,</p><p>This got a little long so I put it under the cut to save people who aren\u2019t as interested in Catelyn and Jon as I am the trouble of scrolling past! :-)</p><!-- more --><p>I am guessing you are the same anon I just responded to about Sansa never calling Jon her brother because it\u2019s kind of unlikely I\u2019d get two anonymous questions about Catelyn\u2019s impact on her children\u2019s relationship with Jon sent on the same day, but just in case you aren\u2019t, please take a look at the response I just posted to that ask as it addresses this question a bit, too, and I won\u2019t repeat what I put there.</p><p>I believe Catelyn wanted her children to understand the difference between Jon\u2019s status and their own because she honestly feared the threat he posed to their inheritance and potentially even their lives. Now, readers know that Jon loves his trueborn siblings dearly and that for all his perfectly understandable jealousy of them, he doesn\u2019t want to take what is theirs. (Well, in the books anyway. I don\u2019t watch the show, but from what I heard D&amp;D basically made all of Catelyn\u2019s fears justified in the show by having the Northmen declare Jon their king and having Jon accept it while Sansa was sitting right beside him. I\u2019m not talking about that Jon. I\u2019m talking about the ,\u00a0\u201cDamn, Stannis, you\u2019re killing me here because I really, really want to be Lord of Winterfell but WINTERFELL BELONGS TO MY SISTER SANSA\u201d that I know from the books.) It can be HARD to empathize with Catelyn\u2019s feelings of fear when we spend time in Jon\u2019s head and know that he\u2019d never challenge Robb or the others for Winterfell. But Catelyn is NOT in Jon\u2019s head. And Westerosi history is full of cautionary tales of bastards who have laid claim to titles/lands/crowns, etc. that belonged to trueborn relatives. (And yes, there are tales of bastards who were very loyal and tremendously helpful to their trueborn siblings, too, I know. But scary history is still scary. Like, I\u2019m sure there might be some honest, moral, intelligent billionaire businessmen out there that want to run for president for all the right reasons and do a good job, but after experiencing the current occupant of the Oval Office, I\u2019m not gonna chance it and vote for any of them!) Catelyn\u2019s desire for her children to be wary of Jon is grounded in her desire to protect them and for them to protect themselves rather than some vicious hatred toward Jon personally.</p><p>Catelyn is also personally hurt by Jon\u2019s presence in Winterfell. At first, it was her pride and sense of self-worth as the Lady of Winterfell that was hurt by the fact that her husband chose to keep a bastard in her home with her and her children. Over the years, it was her heart that hurt as well as she came to love Ned and had to grapple with the fact that as much as he loved her, he must have loved Jon\u2019s mother as much or more as nothing would convince him to send the boy away. Catelyn is jealous of Jon\u2019s mother. Not because Ned slept with her and made a baby back when they barely knew each other. No. She wasn\u2019t really bothered by the notion of a husband who was basically stranger at the time meeting his physical needs with some other woman or by him stepping up to the plate by claiming and seeing to the care of a kid that came from it. She\u2019s jealous of Jon\u2019s mother because she loves her husband, and Jon\u2019s presence in Winterfell and his obvious deep affection for him makes her fear that her beloved husband still hold this woman tightly in his heart. I don\u2019t know too many women who are going to feel good about that sort of thing.</p><p>So she wants Jon elsewhere. Not dead. Fostered, perhaps. Set up with an apprenticeship. Given a nice life far from Winterfell. She didn\u2019t wish harm on him. That whole\u00a0\u201cpraying for his death and then repenting and swearing she\u2019d have Ned legitimize him and then going back on her word and being convinced she\u2019s the cause of ALL THE BAD because she couldn\u2019t love a motherless child\u201d never happens in the books. Catelyn didn\u2019t encourage Ned to send him to the Wall, either. That option doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to her until Maester Luwin tells her and Ned that Jon HIMSELF has asked to go there. Now, I freely admit she thinks it\u2019s brilliant once she does hear it as the Wall means no descendants which neatly addresses her biggest problem with Jon\u2013the threat to her children. But the big point here is that her first response to Jon\u2019s existence was that she wanted Ned to have him raised elsewhere. And it\u2019s clear in her POV segments that she expressed this wish more than once. It may sound cruel to our 21st century ears to ask a father to send his own child away, but that was actually what was done with noble bastards in this society by responsible dads. See to their welfare, acknowledge your responsibility for them, and get them away from your family. Ned was the one acting outside the norm in this, not Catelyn.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t send Jon away. And he insisted on Jon\u2019s inclusion in every aspect of family life that was feasible. Even Ned knew that seating a bastard at the high table with visiting lords or certainly the king was a big NOPE and that Jon had to learn early that Winterfell would never come to him. But he wanted to give Jon safety and a family and he forced Catelyn\u2019s hand. And she obeyed him. She never prevented her children from interacting with him or calling him brother. He ate with her family (yes, folks, that\u2019s canon. It\u2019s only at the formal feasts that his status kept him from eating with his siblings), had lessons with her children, was ALWAYS there. And she could do nothing about it. So she allowed everything Ned insisted upon and not one thing more. She made it clear that he was Ned\u2019s son, not hers. She took no interest in him, did not include him in things she did with the children without Ned, let her children know that Jon was not her child, and did not pretend to them or anyone else that she cared about him. Was that a selfless, loving act on her part. No. Was it more than a touch passive aggressive? Yep. But it isn\u2019t incomprehensible. She had zero agency in a situation she found potentially threatening to herself and her children.She couldn\u2019t defy her husband. So she exercised her right as Ned\u2019s wife and the Lady of Winterfell to not be involved with his bastard. And Ned could not fault her for that. Did she actively teach her children to hate bastards in general? No. She didn\u2019t even actively teach them to hate Jon. She just very visibly did not love him or even like him. She never let herself know him well enough to like him. And that certainly had an impact on her children and Jon.\u00a0</p><p>Jon, without question, was an innocent child. He did not deserve her disdain or her fear or resentment. He sure as hell didn\u2019t deserve that awful remark she made in the depths of her grief over Bran right before he left for the Wall. Jon suffered emotional pain as a child who couldn\u2019t understand why his siblings\u2019 mother didn\u2019t love him. Catelyn\u2019s children suffered confusion and hurt as well because they loved their brother and their mother and knew those two didn\u2019t love each other. So while I believe that Catelyn abided by Ned\u2019s wishes and did not actively\u00a0\u201cmeddle\u201d in her children\u2019s relationship with Jon, her own feelings about it were clear enough to all of them that each of their relationships with him was impacted to some degree.\u00a0</p><p>In the end, the entire Ned/Cat/Jon relationship is a painful, complex tangled mess that impacted all of the Starks negatively to some degree regardless of what either Ned or Catelyn wanted or intended\u2013and I believe the primary motivators for the actions or reactions of both of them was the protection of children (Jon for Ned, and the other Starklings for Catelyn) which just makes the entire situation even sadder.</p><p>Short answer, Nonnie, is that while I think the evil, meddling Catelyn who constantly attempts to sabotage Jon\u2019s relationships with is siblings is entirely a fandom creation, her feelings toward Jon did impact all the children. In fairness, I think discussing how Catelyn\u2019s relationship (or non-relationship) with Jon impacted all the kids without discussing how Ned\u2019s supposed infidelity/refusal to speak to ANYONE including Jon about his alleged mother/forcibly inserting his\u00a0\u201cbastard\u201d into the family without regard for his wife impacted all the kids is only looking at a partial picture, but this post is more than long enough.</p><p>Cheers!\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>",

I don\u2019t watch the show, but from what I heard D&amp;D basically made all of Catelyn\u2019s fears justified in the show by having the Northmen declare Jon their king and having Jon accept it while Sansa was sitting right beside him. I\u2019m not talking about that Jon. I\u2019m talking about the ,\u00a0\u201cDamn, Stannis, you\u2019re killing me here because I really, really want to be Lord of Winterfell but WINTERFELL BELONGS TO MY SISTER SANSA\u201d that I know from the books.) It can be HARD to empathize with Catelyn\u2019s feelings of fear when we spend time in Jon\u2019s head and know that he\u2019d never challenge Robb or the others for Winterfell. But Catelyn is NOT in Jon\u2019s head. And Westerosi history is full of cautionary tales of bastards who have laid claim to titles/lands/crowns, etc. that belonged to trueborn relatives. (And yes, there are tales of bastards who were very loyal and tremendously helpful to their trueborn siblings, too, I know. But scary history is still scary. Like, I\u2019m sure there might be some honest, moral, intelligent billionaire businessmen out there that want to run for president for all the right reasons and do a good job, but after experiencing the current occupant of the Oval Office, I\u2019m not gonna chance it and vote for any of them!) Catelyn\u2019s desire for her children to be wary of Jon is grounded in her desire to protect them and for them to protect themselves rather than some vicious hatred toward Jon personally.</p><p>Catelyn is also personally hurt by Jon\u2019s presence in Winterfell. At first, it was her pride and sense of self-worth as the Lady of Winterfell that was hurt by the fact that her husband chose to keep a bastard in her home with her and her children. Over the years, it was her heart that hurt as well as she came to love Ned and had to grapple with the fact that as much as he loved her, he must have loved Jon\u2019s mother as much or more as nothing would convince him to send the boy away. Catelyn is jealous of Jon\u2019s mother. Not because Ned slept with her and made a baby back when they barely knew each other. No. She wasn\u2019t really bothered by the notion of a husband who was basically stranger at the time meeting his physical needs with some other woman or by him stepping up to the plate by claiming and seeing to the care of a kid that came from it. She\u2019s jealous of Jon\u2019s mother because she loves her husband, and Jon\u2019s presence in Winterfell and his obvious deep affection for him makes her fear that her beloved husband still hold this woman tightly in his heart. I don\u2019t know too many women who are going to feel good about that sort of thing.</p><p>So she wants Jon elsewhere. Not dead. Fostered, perhaps. Set up with an apprenticeship. Given a nice life far from Winterfell. She didn\u2019t wish harm on him. That whole\u00a0\u201cpraying for his death and then repenting and swearing she\u2019d have Ned legitimize him and then going back on her word and being convinced she\u2019s the cause of ALL THE BAD because she couldn\u2019t love a motherless child\u201d never happens in the books. Catelyn didn\u2019t encourage Ned to send him to the Wall, either. That option doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to her until Maester Luwin tells her and Ned that Jon HIMSELF has asked to go there. Now, I freely admit she thinks it\u2019s brilliant once she does hear it as the Wall means no descendants which neatly addresses her biggest problem with Jon\u2013the threat to her children. But the big point here is that her first response to Jon\u2019s existence was that she wanted Ned to have him raised elsewhere. And it\u2019s clear in her POV segments that she expressed this wish more than once. It may sound cruel to our 21st century ears to ask a father to send his own child away, but that was actually what was done with noble bastards in this society by responsible dads. See to their welfare, acknowledge your responsibility for them, and get them away from your family. Ned was the one acting outside the norm in this, not Catelyn.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t send Jon away. And he insisted on Jon\u2019s inclusion in every aspect of family life that was feasible. Even Ned knew that seating a bastard at the high table with visiting lords or certainly the king was a big NOPE and that Jon had to learn early that Winterfell would never come to him. But he wanted to give Jon safety and a family and he forced Catelyn\u2019s hand. And she obeyed him. She never prevented her children from interacting with him or calling him brother. He ate with her family (yes, folks, that\u2019s canon. It\u2019s only at the formal feasts that his status kept him from eating with his siblings), had lessons with her children, was ALWAYS there. And she could do nothing about it. So she allowed everything Ned insisted upon and not one thing more. She made it clear that he was Ned\u2019s son, not hers. She took no interest in him, did not include him in things she did with the children without Ned, let her children know that Jon was not her child, and did not pretend to them or anyone else that she cared about him. Was that a selfless, loving act on her part. No. Was it more than a touch passive aggressive? Yep. But it isn\u2019t incomprehensible. She had zero agency in a situation she found potentially threatening to herself and her children.She couldn\u2019t defy her husband. So she exercised her right as Ned\u2019s wife and the Lady of Winterfell to not be involved with his bastard. And Ned could not fault her for that. Did she actively teach her children to hate bastards in general? No. She didn\u2019t even actively teach them to hate Jon. She just very visibly did not love him or even like him. She never let herself know him well enough to like him. And that certainly had an impact on her children and Jon.\u00a0</p><p>Jon, without question, was an innocent child. He did not deserve her disdain or her fear or resentment. He sure as hell didn\u2019t deserve that awful remark she made in the depths of her grief over Bran right before he left for the Wall. Jon suffered emotional pain as a child who couldn\u2019t understand why his siblings\u2019 mother didn\u2019t love him. Catelyn\u2019s children suffered confusion and hurt as well because they loved their brother and their mother and knew those two didn\u2019t love each other. So while I believe that Catelyn abided by Ned\u2019s wishes and did not actively\u00a0\u201cmeddle\u201d in her children\u2019s relationship with Jon, her own feelings about it were clear enough to all of them that each of their relationships with him was impacted to some degree.\u00a0</p><p>In the end, the entire Ned/Cat/Jon relationship is a painful, complex tangled mess that impacted all of the Starks negatively to some degree regardless of what either Ned or Catelyn wanted or intended\u2013and I believe the primary motivators for the actions or reactions of both of them was the protection of children (Jon for Ned, and the other Starklings for Catelyn) which just makes the entire situation even sadder.</p><p>Short answer, Nonnie, is that while I think the evil, meddling Catelyn who constantly attempts to sabotage Jon\u2019s relationships with is siblings is entirely a fandom creation, her feelings toward Jon did impact all the children. In fairness, I think discussing how Catelyn\u2019s relationship (or non-relationship) with Jon impacted all the kids without discussing how Ned\u2019s supposed infidelity/refusal to speak to ANYONE including Jon about his alleged mother/forcibly inserting his\u00a0\u201cbastard\u201d into the family without regard for his wife impacted all the kids is only looking at a partial picture, but this post is more than long enough.</p><p>Cheers!\u00a0\u00a0<br></p>",
