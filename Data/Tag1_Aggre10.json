Here\u2019s the thing, he\u2019s a nonsense person, he would be an incredibly difficult person to hold a relationship with in general, never mind the whole marriage thing -we will get to that too however. <br/><br/>\nInnovators tend to be about 100% efficiency in getting to their goals and such a mindset tends to \nsacrifice some touch with humanity to achieve that (what I mean when I say \u2018nonsense person\u2019.) An example of this in fiction would be Griffith from Berserk. \nAn example from real life would be Elon Musk.\n(not 100% matches mind you, just similar personalities and mindset). There is little perspective to what \u201cother\u2019s\u201d worldviews are like. They are focused on their inner worldview. For better or worse. Which also boils down to potentially ignoring the thoughts and feelings of others.<br/><br/> P.s.: Nonsense person also means someone that makes a 2 and a half \nhour to 3 hour trip, there and back, to go to One Specific ramen bar on a First\n date\u2019s worknight&hellip;<br/><br/>Also p.s.: to clarify\u00a0\u201cnonsense person\u201d is not intended as a bad statement but rather a descriptor. The person writing this is definitely a nonsense person sometimes too&hellip;so yeah..that\u2019s how I know&hellip;<br/><br/>Let me list some things here about what Tadano did wrong with Retsuko<br/><br/><b>-Didn\u2019t defend Retsuko from online harassment.</b><br/><br/>It makes sense that a guy that lives so carefree would not understand the importance of making a small statement (at least) on how they met, online. Or at least on how serious such comments hurt and better console/comfort Retsuko rather than essentially \u201csuck it up\u201d. <br/><br/><b>-Lives in his car&hellip;?</b><br/><br/>Dudes and dudettes. There is nothing healthy about living in a car. This coming from a person that has had to sleep in a car sometimes. It\u2019s bad for the back, and the body. Though I do imagine his limo is comfier, it\u2019s not a substitute for an actual room. There was little space and it was dark. Which leads to the next part. <br/><br/><b>-Lives an unhealthy lifestyle. </b><br/></p><p>The main reason Tadano has a bad sleep habit is that he has little structure. Part of the reason some people like their jobs is that it gives them that structure!. It\u2019s necessary for your body to move each day. And its GOOD for your mind to socialize with people, even occasionally people one might dislike. Because people are social animals.

                "content": "<p>Season 2 was pretty good huh? Sure it wasn&rsquo;t as fun as the first but it felt more focused, but we&rsquo;re not here to talk about that, I wanna talk about the one thing.</p><p>Tadano and Retsuko.</p><p>Right, a few things to highlight before I start: The break up wasn&rsquo;t Tadano&rsquo;s fault, or rather not <i>entirely</i>&nbsp;his fault. There&rsquo;s no bad guy here, and just like her previous relationship, there&rsquo;s nothing&nbsp;&ldquo;toxic&rdquo; going on.</p><p>The break up hinged on one specific thing, that is that Retsuko wanted to get married, and Tadano doesn&rsquo;t. Sure, it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated then that, but that&rsquo;s the heart of the matter.</p><p>Retsuko and Tadano have a genuine relationship, they can talk to each other, joke around, and overall feel more or less comfortable being themselves around each other. They honestly do care for one another, love each other even.</p><p>Tadano is not a bad guy, a bit lazy sure, but he listens to Restuko, talks honestly with her, and has a pretty noble goal in mind with his work. But he&rsquo;s also set in his beliefs, and that can make him dismissive. Insensitive, even.</p><p>Retsuko asks him what people are supposed to do after his A.I does its thing, and he says he hasn&rsquo;t thought that far, and when she asks what SHE is going to do, he says he&rsquo;ll just take care of her.</p><p>When news breaks of their relationship, he shrugs off the press, but doesn&rsquo;t seem concerned with how Retsuko is handling it, saying it doesn&rsquo;t matter. When she has doubts about going to work, Tadano states that her work can go on without her, seemingly unaware of how&hellip;tactless that could sound.</p><p>Then, the wedding thing.</p><p>Season 2 focused on one thing, that is Retsuko asking herself one simple question:&nbsp;&ldquo;What do I want?&rdquo; She has her doubts, and it takes a bit of stumbling, but she reaches her answer. She wants to get married. Not someone that her mother picked out, but someone SHE wants, that she cares for.</p><p>She wants to be a wife, and a mother, and when the press suggests she and Tadano might get married, she&rsquo;s <i>ecstatic. </i>It&rsquo;s literally the only thing keeping her going as news sites slam her for being a gold digger and attack her character.</p><p>Then Tadano says that&nbsp;&ldquo;Marriage is a meaningless thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Retsuko wants to get married, Tadano said that marriage is meaningless, that what <i>Retsuko</i>&nbsp;<i>wants more then anything</i>, is meaningless.
