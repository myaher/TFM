The magic was compelling his lips to loosen and spill the truth of his past, or apparent lack thereof. Caleb had kept his own mouth shut, for the most part, but now he leaned forward, watching Molly\u2019s red eyes flash at the notion of being called \u201cLucien\u201d. </p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Let me make this abundantly clear: My name is Molly. That person is dead, and not me. It&rsquo;s just a person who had this body. They abandoned it.\u201d And then, in a quick flourish of conviction, jutting his thumbs out at himself, \u201cIt&rsquo;s mine now.\u201d</p><p>As Nott and Molly began antagonizing one another again, there was a profound, familiar ache in Caleb\u2019s chest, one that he knew none of the people around him would realize. <i>What an odd parallel to have with this bright circus man</i>, he thought, flames licking at the base of his thoughts, <i>for a name, or a body, to be yours, but also a ghost\u2019s. </i></p><p>Caleb could feel the strange divine magics around him begin to fade, and thus felt safe interjecting, \u201cPerhaps we have learned all we need to learn from this conversation. Maybe it is time to turn in. We have some things to do tomorrow. I am satisfied, Mollymauk Tealeaf.\u201d A short, silent beat, eyes locking with Mollymauk\u2019s, \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Molly held his gaze for a moment. \u201cThis was not how I expected this to go. Thank you.\u201d The spell dissipated around them, and Caleb dropped his eyes first, gaze falling to the ground. Eye contact was always uncomfortable, but with Mollymauk in particular; something about those flat, crimson eyes could see past the dirt and the dust, right into his intentionally obfuscated soul. Caleb knew what it was like to leave behind a name, an identity, and never want to touch it again, and some part of him feared Mollymauk would realize this specific and damning empathy. </p><p>The conversation shifted, into their job for the Gentleman, into something Caleb didn\u2019t bother listening to. He was thinking of names, of Lucien and Molly, of Caleb and Bren. </p><p>Bren was a name that burned when he held it. It was an impossible feeling, to simultaneously know that Bren was himself and yet another person entirely. All the good he could connect to the name&ndash; the lullabies his mother sang to him, the pride in his father\u2019s voice&ndash; it all went down in flames with the awful. It got mixed up with and tainted by Trent\u2019s beratings and role-calling, his name being shouted as he messed up complicated spells, as he cried and collapsed in front of his burning home. And now he was here, he was Caleb.</p><p>So, in a way, Bren was his Lucien. There were people out there searching for Bren, but they would find Caleb in his stead. It wasn\u2019t an exact parallel, of course. Some small, selfish part of Caleb envied Mollymauk\u2019s amnesia; that part of him would have given anything to forget Bren and everything attached to that name. Unlike Molly, Caleb was well aware of every horrible thing his past self had reveled in. </p><p>Caleb stared down at his hands, the brown gloves perpetually singed and covering the calloused, ugly things beneath them. <i>My name is Caleb</i>, his thoughts echoed, allowing himself to replicate the confidence of Mollymauk for a moment<i>, that person is dead and not me. It&rsquo;s just a person who had this body. They abandoned it. It\u2019s mine now. </i></p><p>It was a nice thought, but he knew that Bren would never abandon him in the way that Lucien abandoned Mollymauk. And he, Caleb, would always be responsible and <i>guilty</i> for Bren\u2019s atrocities. Bren was wholly unforgivable and so was he. </p><p>Nott nudged his leg, and Caleb jumped slightly, his startled gaze matching her yellow, earnest one. </p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d Her eyes were less piercing than Mollymauk\u2019s, but nonetheless unnerving in the face of his guilt. Caleb glanced off to the side, at the wall, at nothing. </p><p>\u201cJa,\u201d he breathed, turning his eyes towards the table, \u201cAre you ready to go upstairs now?\u201d He noticed the conversation amongst his compatriots had stilled, as they gathered up their things and talked low amongst themselves. Mollymauk was looking at him, and Caleb stood quickly from his seat, ready to disappear into his room. </p><p>She cast him a sidelong glance as he stood. \u201cYes,\u201d She said, hesitant, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright, Caleb?\u201d Caleb didn\u2019t reply, and tried not to seem hurried as he rushed to the stairs.</p><p>He felt Mollymauk\u2019s gaze burning into his back the entire way up to his room. </p>",

You never/rarely want to set up your party for a \u2018<i>one wrong move and you\u2019re all dead\u2019</i> situation. Every potential dangerous situation usually has contingency plans, especially ones that rely heavily on diplomacy instead of just straight up fighting.</p><p>I think it\u2019s pretty obvious Matt works this way as well, evident from years of watching him DM, but also the DM notes he just posted.\u00a0He plans for contingencies even in situations that might normally seem like a TPK, for example after which characters might simply get knocked unconscious and wake up as prisoners.</p><p>Yes, in the notes currently it appears Cree would have been their only out if they lost during a Gentleman confrontation.\u00a0However, now that Molly is out of the picture, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as\u00a0\u2018<i>Well, this means they\u2019re fucked if they ever decide to screw with the Gentleman\u2019.\u00a0</i>As a DM, you would come up with new options, because otherwise it\u2019s unfair to put the party in a potential no-win scenario down the line.</p><p>Personally, I feel like Jester\u2019s whole history with the Gentleman is a huge opportunity, so I would find it quite boring for both the players and for the story if it turned out the Gentleman would want to murder her just to tie up loose ends. I think exploiting that relationship to the benefit for the party would also allow Matt to show a different side to the Gentleman, where we would be able to see him struggle with what\u2019s best for him/his business vs. the emotional attachment he might have to the Ruby/Jester. This would lead to a way more interesting story, and would give the party a new way out of potentially unwinnable scenario, if one should ever arise.\u00a0</p>",
