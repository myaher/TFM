Nott thought it might help.&rdquo; He said, offering the vial\nwhile carefully not looking at them for too long.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Zabbini answered, openly peering at him, trying\nto know for how long he&rsquo;s been there. </p><p>Harry turned his attention to Malfoy, hoping he wasn&rsquo;t\nblushing. &ldquo;Drink it up, it helps.&rdquo; was all he found to say before exiting the\nroom, mortified.</p><hr /><p>Thank you for reading ! :)</p>",

But I always imagined my first kiss to be with someone else.\u201d<br/></p><p>He leaned more into you and out of the corner of your eye you saw him closing his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Draco ignored you, pretended to be asleep.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d, you asked again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, they never thought about me that way anyway&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>You scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI find that very hard to believe, you\u2019re Draco Malfoy, the Slytherin Prince. Anyone would be lucky to have you.\u201d<br/></p><p>Draco opened his eyes and looked at you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnyone?\u201d<br/></p><p>A slight blush spread across your cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><hr><p>\u201cWhat did you mean the other day?\u201d, you asked Hermoine as you sat down next to her at the Gryffindor table.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHello to you too, (y/n)\u201d, your friend replied.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You grinned and greeted her and Harry and Ron.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about\u201d, Hermoine said, filling her goblet.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You looked around the Great Hall, your eyes met Draco\u2019s at the Slytherin table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan we talk somewhere else?\u201d<br/></p><p>Hermoine agreed and you hurried towards the Entry Hall.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou said Draco just wants to get in my pants, what makes you think that?\u201d<br/></p><p>Hermoine gave you a once over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe way he looks at you. Everyone suspects Draco is in a friends with benefits situation with someone, though no one knows with whom.

You\u2019re kind of perfect for each other.\u201d<br/></p><p>You grinned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Your friend just gave you a look, that explained everything.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know him, what you interpret as love might as well be lust&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Hermoine sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on you to find out.\u201d<br/></p><hr><p>You kicked Draco underneath the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDraco.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDraco.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDra-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMr Malfoy, is there something you\u2019d like to share with the class?\u201d, Professor McGonagall asked.\u00a0<br/></p><p>A few Gryffindors laughed, Draco blushed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, professor.\u201d<br/></p><p>She continued her lesson.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d, Draco whispered under his breath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCan we talk? After dinner in the astronomy tower?\u201d<br/></p><p>Draco went pale and blushed and pale again within seconds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d<br/></p><p>You nodded, copying a sentence from the board.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI kinda had something planned&hellip; For us&hellip;Tonight&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>You looked at your best friend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure whatever it is can wait, I have something important to tell you.\u201d<br/></p><hr><p>You didn\u2019t eat much dinner, you were too nervous.\u00a0</p><p>And Draco? Of course he had only thought about one thing for tonight.\u00a0</p><p>But you had to come clean, you had to tell him how you felt.</p><p>Draco hadn\u2019t been at dinner, nevertheless you hurried to the top of the tower after getting a box from your room.\u00a0</p><p>By the time you arrived the sun had almost set, casting a golden shimmer all over Hogwarts.\u00a0</p><p>You tried to catch your breath and looked around the tower, searching for Draco.\u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t see your best friend, but you did see a blanket, rose petals, scented candles and heard music.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI had this planned for weeks\u201d, Draco told you, stepping out of the shadows with a small box in his hand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI actually wanted to talk to you, so if you wanted to seduce me and give me another one of your toys, can you please wait?\u201d<br/></p><p>Draco smiled, not his usual cocky smile, but a real, sincere smile.\u00a0</p><p>He sat down on the blanket and motioned you to do the same.\u00a0</p><p>He put his small box in his lap and you laid yours in your lap.</p><p>\u201cI know we have a deal, I know our deals says we can\u2019t fall in love with the other just because we\u2019re&hellip;closer than most best friends. But that rule is stupid, because I was already in love with you when we started, I have been for years.\u201d<br/></p><p>You reached for your box and handed it to Draco.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to be my first kiss. Since 3rd year I can\u2019t stop thinking about you, I fell in love with you all those years ago\u201d, he blurted out, seconds before you pressed the box in his hands.\u00a0<br/></p><p>It took you a second to process his words.</p><p>\u201cYou&hellip;what?\u201d<br/></p><p>Draco blushed, he pushed his small box over to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI planned on telling you today. On ending our arrangement. Though I also bought you something, just in case there was a chance you felt the same.\u201d<br/></p><p>Now it was your turn to blush.\u00a0</p><p>You opened the box, a small necklace was inside.\u00a0</p><p>A silver necklace with a heart at the end, a small green gem was on the one side, two letters on the other, your initials. D and (y/f/l).</p><p>\u201cDraco, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you.\u201d<br/></p><p>You smiled at him.\u00a0</p><p>Draco took the necklace out of your hands and put it around your neck, leaning closer and closer in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you\u201d, he whispered against your lips.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You closed your eyes, put your hands around his neck and pulled him even closer, until your lips finally met.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d, you smiled at him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Draco pecked you on the lips before opening his present.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChocolate?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.\u00a0</p><p>You shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very original, though we can share\u201d, you grinned.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The next few kisses tasted like chocolate, hope and love</p><p>\u201cGuess we need a new arrangement.\u201d<br/></p><p>You laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI guess so, boyfriend.\u201d<br/></p><p>Draco kissed you once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that, girlfriend.\u201d<br/></p><p>Needless to say kissing wasn\u2019t the only thing you did that night</p>",

What\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br></p><p>He pushed himself away from you, sat up in the bed.\u00a0</p><p>His pale skin shone in the barely lit room, his eyes sparkled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just-\u201d You laughed again,\u00a0\u201cYou do realise I\u2019m not yours, we\u2019re just\u2026 it\u2019s purely physical.\u201d<br></p><p>Draco laid down next to you on the small bed. He turned on his side, facing you.\u00a0</p><p>His arm sneaked around you and he pulled you closer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. You\u2019re still you, my best friend. You\u2019re still funny and brilliant and ambitious and smart and beautiful and you have an amazing laugh and your hair is just so soft and your lips-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>With every word he moved his body more and more atop yours, his face closer to yours, his lips closer to yours.\u00a0</p><p>He seemed like he was in a trance.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDraco, Draco, stop\u201d, you told him, pushing his face farther away.\u00a0<br></p><p>A small frown replaced his grin, but quickly went away again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to kiss you? Are you that bad of a kisser?\u201d<br></p><p>He tried to keep his voice even, joking, but his lips ached to touch yours.</p><p>You were quiet for a moment. Your hand tangled in Draco\u2019s hair and massaged his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just always pictured my first kiss, always wanted it to be this fairy tale experience. I never had these thoughts about my first time, just my first kiss. It\u2019s stupid, I know, but I want my first kiss to be with someone I love and who loves me.\u201d<br></p><p>Draco leaned closer again and brushed his nose against yours, his breath his your lips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour first kiss?\u201d, he grinned.</p><p>The hand on Draco\u2019s head slapped him lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShut up. Who was your first kiss with?\u201d<br></p><p>Draco laid down next to you once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, but don\u2019t laugh.\u201d<br></p><p>You promised.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBlaise.\u201d<br></p><p>You didn\u2019t laugh, you really didn\u2019t. But a smile crept up your face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cZabini?\u201d<br></p><p>Draco nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br></p><p>The blonde leaned closer to you and placed his head on your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was a game of Truth or Dare in 3rd year.\u201d<br></p><p>You remembered these games, you had always thought them childish and never participated, you spend your time reading or studying.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026expect anything?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell\u2026No, not from the kiss itself. But I always imagined my first kiss to be with someone else.\u201d<br></p><p>He leaned more into you and out of the corner of your eye you saw him closing his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Draco ignored you, pretended to be asleep.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d, you asked again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, they never thought about me that way anyway\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>You scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI find that very hard to believe, you\u2019re Draco Malfoy, the Slytherin Prince. Anyone would be lucky to have you.\u201d<br></p><p>Draco opened his eyes and looked at you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnyone?\u201d<br></p><p>A slight blush spread across your cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d<br></p><hr><p>\u201cWhat did you mean the other day?\u201d, you asked Hermoine as you sat down next to her at the Gryffindor table.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHello to you too, (y/n)\u201d, your friend replied.\u00a0<br></p><p>You grinned and greeted her and Harry and Ron.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about\u201d, Hermoine said, filling her goblet.\u00a0<br></p><p>You looked around the Great Hall, your eyes met Draco\u2019s at the Slytherin table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan we talk somewhere else?\u201d<br></p><p>Hermoine agreed and you hurried towards the Entry Hall.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou said Draco just wants to get in my pants, what makes you think that?\u201d<br></p><p>Hermoine gave you a once over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe way he looks at you. Everyone suspects Draco is in a friends with benefits situation with someone, though no one knows with whom. I never suspected you, but I though he wanted to\u2026you know\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>You bit down on your lip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense, why would he look at me like that when we\u2019re already- wait, you don\u2019t think he might actually like me, do you?\u201d<br></p><p>Hermoine sighed, she played with her hair, her wand, anything to avoid looking at you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really think Draco is capable of actual romantic feelings, but if he was, you\u2019d be the one he would fall for. You\u2019re kind of perfect for each other.\u201d<br></p><p>You grinned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Your friend just gave you a look, that explained everything.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know him, what you interpret as love might as well be lust\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Hermoine sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on you to find out.\u201d<br></p><hr><p>You kicked Draco underneath the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDraco.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDraco.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDra-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMr Malfoy, is there something you\u2019d like to share with the class?\u201d, Professor McGonagall asked.\u00a0<br></p><p>A few Gryffindors laughed, Draco blushed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, professor.\u201d<br></p><p>She continued her lesson.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d, Draco whispered under his breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCan we talk? After dinner in the astronomy tower?\u201d<br></p><p>Draco went pale and blushed and pale again within seconds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d<br></p><p>You nodded, copying a sentence from the board.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI kinda had something planned\u2026 For us\u2026Tonight\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>You looked at your best friend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure whatever it is can wait, I have something important to tell you.\u201d<br></p><hr><p>You didn\u2019t eat much dinner, you were too nervous.\u00a0</p><p>And Draco? Of course he had only thought about one thing for tonight.\u00a0</p><p>But you had to come clean, you had to tell him how you felt.</p><p>Draco hadn\u2019t been at dinner, nevertheless you hurried to the top of the tower after getting a box from your room.\u00a0</p><p>By the time you arrived the sun had almost set, casting a golden shimmer all over Hogwarts.\u00a0</p><p>You tried to catch your breath and looked around the tower, searching for Draco.\u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t see your best friend, but you did see a blanket, rose petals, scented candles and heard music.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI had this planned for weeks\u201d, Draco told you, stepping out of the shadows with a small box in his hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI actually wanted to talk to you, so if you wanted to seduce me and give me another one of your toys, can you please wait?\u201d<br></p><p>Draco smiled, not his usual cocky smile, but a real, sincere smile.\u00a0</p><p>He sat down on the blanket and motioned you to do the same.\u00a0</p><p>He put his small box in his lap and you laid yours in your lap.</p><p>\u201cI know we have a deal, I know our deals says we can\u2019t fall in love with the other just because we\u2019re\u2026closer than most best friends. But that rule is stupid, because I was already in love with you when we started, I have been for years.\u201d<br></p><p>You reached for your box and handed it to Draco.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to be my first kiss. Since 3rd year I can\u2019t stop thinking about you, I fell in love with you all those years ago\u201d, he blurted out, seconds before you pressed the box in his hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>It took you a second to process his words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026what?\u201d<br></p><p>Draco blushed, he pushed his small box over to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI planned on telling you today. On ending our arrangement. Though I also bought you something, just in case there was a chance you felt the same.\u201d<br></p><p>Now it was your turn to blush.\u00a0</p><p>You opened the box, a small necklace was inside.\u00a0</p><p>A silver necklace with a heart at the end, a small green gem was on the one side, two letters on the other, your initials. D and (y/f/l).</p><p>\u201cDraco, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you.\u201d<br></p><p>You smiled at him.\u00a0</p><p>Draco took the necklace out of your hands and put it around your neck, leaning closer and closer in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you\u201d, he whispered against your lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>You closed your eyes, put your hands around his neck and pulled him even closer, until your lips finally met.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d, you smiled at him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Draco pecked you on the lips before opening his present.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChocolate?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.\u00a0</p><p>You shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very original, though we can share\u201d, you grinned.\u00a0<br></p><p>The next few kisses tasted like chocolate, hope and love</p><p>\u201cGuess we need a new arrangement.\u201d<br></p><p>You laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI guess so, boyfriend.\u201d<br></p><p>Draco kissed you once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that, girlfriend.\u201d<br></p><p>Needless to say kissing wasn\u2019t the only thing you did that night</p>",
