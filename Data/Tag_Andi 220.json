They both do fashion and lifestyle but Andi focuses more on DIY. And, of course, they collab together most of the time and question why they didn\u2019t just start one channel together. You know there\u2019d be a Q&amp;A video where they answer questions while baking a cake or something and it\u2019s like some rainbow cake and they\u2019re mixing together all the different colors and everything but along the way they eat more of the batter than the actual cake itself.</p><p>Somewhere along the way they\u2019d both have coming out videos. Amber\u2019s would be titled something like \u201cComing Out.\u201d with a dramatic thumbnail of her looking upset or something. And Andi\u2019s would be titled something like \u201cI\u2019m Bi!!!\u201d with her grinning really big in a custom thumbnail complete with cute doodles and editing.</p><p>They book random flights for mini trips out to LA and New York. They still live in the small town of Shadyside and they always have an itch to travel together. They don\u2019t label their relationship is yet even though they\u2019re constantly holding hands and cuddling. They fight over the window seat even though most of the time Andi falls asleep on Amber\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>They do vlogs during their travels and get more popular and eventually they save up enough money to go to Apulia, Italy!!! They take a leisurely canoe ride (ya know like the one from The Little Mermaid when \u201cKiss The Girl\u201d is playing) and tell the story of how \u201c3 years ago Amber texted me that she wanted to go here but we never actually thought we\u2019d be here!\u201d Amber would mention how it was the same conversation she tried to call Andi \u201cBig Mack,\u201d and they both share a laugh. Andi asks how she remembers that and amber replies, \u201cI could never forget that conversation.\u201d They\u2019d turn their cameras off and Andi would just be in awe of the scenery with big doe eyes and Amber would be admiring Andi because she looks so incredibly beautiful and happy (like the lantern scene from Tangled). Amber randomly blurts out, \u201cyou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d (which she regularly casually tells Andi). So Andi replies as usual and tells Amber she\u2019s more beautiful. Suddenly, they start one upping each other on who\u2019s more beautiful and they go back and forth telling each other that they\u2019re beautiful. They inch closer each time making sure to keep the canoe balanced until they\u2019re leaning in and no less than a foot apart. They slowly fade out of the \u201cno you\u2019re more beautiful\u201d flirty bickering and silently look into each other\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Andi asks. \u201cWe\u2019re making it official,\u201d Amber says as she leans in to kiss Andi as the canoe shakes beneath them but they couldn\u2019t care less if it tips.</p><p>BONUS!!!!: they go to a local market in Apulia in search of matching friendship bracelets to remember their trip. Amber finds an anklet but sadly there isn\u2019t a second one. Amber secretly buys it and surprises Andi later with it. Andi then makes an <i>exact</i> replica for Amber because she is the diy queen and girlfriend of the year. They have matching anklets and live happily ever after the end.</p>",

Tyrus has/had? such great potential to show a lot of kids they'd eventually find love  just like their straight classmates. It's especially dirty of Disney to let Josh and Luke (it's the poor boys first professional role) take the brunt of fan anger. They love Tyrus as much as us which is honestly so amazing. I'm thankful that they have such as great friendship to support each other",
        "answer": "<p>I mean I really hope people understand and know (esp with the average age of the tumblr fandom) that Luke and Josh are definitely not at fault for whatever happens and should NEVER receive hate over anything that happens with their fictional characters. But they will, of course, and I\u2019m assuming Disney and Terri have done everything they can to help them, and brief them for what could come. Josh for sure knew when he took the role that he would receive hate and have to deal with a lot of angriness (which is why i admire him so much for how active he is with fans) and I\u2019m sure Luke knew too (which is why they casted older actors for these two characters)</p><p>They are great people and they do the most which i\u2019m incredibly thankful for and i too am glad that they have such a good friendship and actually enjoy hanging out with each other</p>",

Although I\u2019m not a fan of Jandi, which is like one of the top storylines because Andi is the titular character, and the slow burn of Cyrus\u2019s storyline, I think it\u2019s a show that can inspire more creators/writers to pitch shows like this to Disney Channel and Disney will green light it.\u00a0</p><p>Yes, I was one of the many that was excited about the gay storyline. And yes, they pretty much haven\u2019t talked about Cyrus\u2019s sexuality a lot. I think three episodes, out of the entire series so far, Cyrus has a conversation about his crush with Jonah (coming out to Buffy, coming out to Andi, and telling Buffy his crush on Jonah is gone), correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But I guess you can count Bex\u2019s speech to Cyrus about \u201cit\u2019s okay to still figure out who you are\u201d but that was before Cyrus was confirmed gay.\u00a0When news broke of Cyrus coming out, they were boycotts and Kenya, an entire country, decided to ban the show. So I think Disney wants to be cautious when it comes to LGBTQ content; canon, not \u201cships\u201d, but actual canon representation.\u00a0</p><p>For now, I\u2019m just waiting to see if Disney will actually allow Cyrus or anybody really say the word\u00a0\u201cgay\u201d. Because Disney Channel shows usually last 4 seasons max, and Andi Mack is in its third now, I hope they don\u2019t miss their chance to show more LGBT canon representation.\u00a0\u2018Cause like you said, it is Disney after all, and for them to green light Cyrus as gay from the very beginning of Terri Minsky pitching the show to them, is still pretty great.
