I'm a frustrated actress/director that never got out in the world to make much of myself so I direct movies in my head and am over dramatic with everything else.

I hope you like :)</p><p>Jedi Knight and General of the 212th, Obi-Wan Kenobi, would readily admit he was confused. For one he had expected to meet with Jabba the Hutt in negotiating the use of the Hutt\u2019s trade routes in the outer-rim - there were no Hutts to be found and he kept being referred to go see some mechanic? And that was another thing that was strange; the atmosphere here seemed so clear \u00a0-like the air after a thunderstorm, like a fresh start. It wasn\u2019t like people were smiling or overly friendly, they were tough people living in a dessert, but he was met with equal parts kindness and suspiciousness. Rarely had he met a people more secretive and all anyone seemed willing to do was direct him towards this \u201cmechanic\u201d.</p><p>And so the Jedi General walked through the dusty streets getting inquisitive glances from natives whose conversations halted as he passed. It should have been unnerving, that attention, but still the force itself was light and clear here - certainly not what he would have expected of Tatooine rumored as it was to be a hive of scum and villainy second only to Nar Shadda. </p><p>Mos Espa, the biggest city on the dessert planet wasn\u2019t as he\u2019d expected either. Sure it had the flat-roofed light buildings set slightly into the ground so as to make for shadeful cool places during the midday heat, but they were decorated with colorful illustrations and symbols he had no context for understanding the meaning of - a circle broken into seven parts were a popular one. Colored fabric hung from window sills and rooftops almost like banners of allegiance ranging from black and white to green, blue, red and orange - no purple nuances at all though and he idly wondered why\u2026 It gave the streets the look of the aftermath of some kind of celebration nobody had bothered to clean up. Obi-Wan had to admit it made for interesting scenery.</p><p>He ran his hand over some carvings almost invisible against the white rock of a doorway and the force whispered protection at him so low he only heard it because he\u2019d stopped to actually listen. Fascinated he looked around and he could now glean other carvings hidden in doorways and window sills and now that he knew what to listen for the wishes of the carvers where a harmonious song at the edge of his hearing; protection, love, family, home.</p><p>Almost in a daze he followed the directions to the mechanic always half an ear on the song. He stopped in front of a nondescript doorway. A sign with a multitool swayed lightly in the breeze over the doorway - he assumed that meant he was in the right place. Really he would have expected someone this important as this mechanic apparently was, would be situauted on the main street and not down a dozen smaller roads and through a couple of backroad-alleys. There was of course always the risk that this was some kind of trick played on stupid foreigners\u2026 In that case.. well he\u2019d always been a proponent of simply springing the trap and trusting the force. He walked down the three steps that put him into the shade of the doorway and knocked curtly on the door before activating the control panel. </p><p>The door opened smoothly with nary a sound to reveal a workroom with tables and shelves scattered with parts and pieces of flimsi with sketches of blueprints on them.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment and I\u2019ll be there,\u201d a young voice yelled from further inside. The sound came from an open doorway and curious Obi-Wan made his way over there moving carefully through the clutter - along the way he though he saw a half finished thermal detonator, but that couldn\u2019t be right. Coming to stand in the doorway he gasped at the hangar he\u2019d entered. Built into the ground the ceiling only rose as high as the rest of the house, but it was dug at least two stories into the ground creating a hangar large enough to fit a couple of medium sized freighters. A winding metal staircase lead to the ground, a ramp lead to a garage sized opening in the far wall and there were signs that the ceiling could open in the middle. Currently it held a single heavily modified freighter, a blue and white pod-racer in the corner, various speeder bikes in different states of repair and a dull red speeder with a pair of long legs sticking out from under it.</p><p>The legs turned out to belong to a tall young man when he pushed out from under the speeder. He noticed the brown robed Jedi unnervingly quickly and waved him down.</p><p>\u201cCome on, if you\u2019re that impatient, you might as well come down here.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan felt a stab of annoyance at being called impatient but quickly let the force have it. As he neared the young man, he noted the bright blue eyes, the prominent scars from both knife and blaster wounds on his bare muscled arms and the curly dark blond hair gathered in a ponytail at his neck. </p><p>Not taking his eyes off Obi-Wan he wiped the worst of the oil off his strong hands with the piece of maybe-once-upon-a-time-white piece of cloth hanging at his belt. </p><p>\u201cGreetings of double-noon, Stranger.\u201d He held out a mostly clean hand, with an offer of his name; \u201cAnakin Skywalker.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan took the proffered hand in a firm handshake and was so startled by this Anakin Skywalker\u2019s bright blazing presence in the force that his own introduction came as a dazed afterthought \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi.\u201d</p><p>Skywalker raised an eyebrow at his belated response as if accepting the strangeness of it then moved on, letting go of Obi-Wan\u2019s hand. His presence muted a bit with the loss of contact but now that Obi-Wan was aware of it, he couldn\u2019t erase it from his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Obi-Wan from the Core? Your hyperdrive break down?\u201d His smile was small but friendly.</p><p>Obi-Wan scoffed and shook his head, \u201cI almost wish it was so, that would make this at least somewhat make sense.\u201d He paused for a moment gathering his thoughts. \u201cActually I was sent here to negotiate with Jabba the Hutt to allow the Republic the use of the trade routes near Tatooine.\u201d</p><p>Skywalker\u2019s gaze sharpened and the smile fell. \u201cYou\u2019re a jedi.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan wordlessly held the left side of his cloak away from his body revealing his lightsaber. </p><p>\u201cI must admit that I was confused, when I asked around and only got referred to \u2018the mechanic\u2019, a very tight-lipped community you got here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Anakin laughed, the strange tension breaking. \u201cThey have got to stop doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what? If I may ask?\u201d</p><p>Anakin\u2019s smile turned sharp. \u201cUsing me to vet strangers.\u201d </p><p>The threat was clear in his tone and while Obi-Wan was confident he could beat the young man in a fight, he also had a bad feeling it would not be easy. </p><p>Skywalker turned around suddenly, breaking the tension as suddenly as he\u2019d created it.</p><p>\u201cCome along then, if you want someone to negotiate with, you\u2019re gonna wanna meet my mother.\u201d</p><p>Mystified he followed Skywalker around as he picked up a few indefinable smaller projects and put them in a dark brown messenger bag. In black stitching in the bottom left corner almost invisible against the dark brown was that symbol of the broken circle again. </p><p>He slung the bag over his shoulder and took the winding staircase in only five leaps using the railing to propel himself upwards.

            "comment": "<p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8MQShtNp3ugFoWf_s_2mHQ\">@fialleril</a> a little something for you, for writing such inspiring metas. I hope you like :)</p><p>Jedi Knight and General of the 212th, Obi-Wan Kenobi, would readily admit he was confused. For one he had expected to meet with Jabba the Hutt in negotiating the use of the Hutt\u2019s trade routes in the outer-rim - there were no Hutts to be found and he kept being referred to go see some mechanic? And that was another thing that was strange; the atmosphere here seemed so clear \u00a0-like the air after a thunderstorm, like a fresh start. It wasn\u2019t like people were smiling or overly friendly, they were tough people living in a dessert, but he was met with equal parts kindness and suspiciousness. Rarely had he met a people more secretive and all anyone seemed willing to do was direct him towards this \u201cmechanic\u201d.</p><p>And so the Jedi General walked through the dusty streets getting inquisitive glances from natives whose conversations halted as he passed. It should have been unnerving, that attention, but still the force itself was light and clear here - certainly not what he would have expected of Tatooine rumored as it was to be a hive of scum and villainy second only to Nar Shadda. </p><p>Mos Espa, the biggest city on the dessert planet wasn\u2019t as he\u2019d expected either. Sure it had the flat-roofed light buildings set slightly into the ground so as to make for shadeful cool places during the midday heat, but they were decorated with colorful illustrations and symbols he had no context for understanding the meaning of - a circle broken into seven parts were a popular one. Colored fabric hung from window sills and rooftops almost like banners of allegiance ranging from black and white to green, blue, red and orange - no purple nuances at all though and he idly wondered why\u2026 It gave the streets the look of the aftermath of some kind of celebration nobody had bothered to clean up. Obi-Wan had to admit it made for interesting scenery.</p><p>He ran his hand over some carvings almost invisible against the white rock of a doorway and the force whispered protection at him so low he only heard it because he\u2019d stopped to actually listen. Fascinated he looked around and he could now glean other carvings hidden in doorways and window sills and now that he knew what to listen for the wishes of the carvers where a harmonious song at the edge of his hearing; protection, love, family, home.</p><p>Almost in a daze he followed the directions to the mechanic always half an ear on the song. He stopped in front of a nondescript doorway. A sign with a multitool swayed lightly in the breeze over the doorway - he assumed that meant he was in the right place. Really he would have expected someone this important as this mechanic apparently was, would be situauted on the main street and not down a dozen smaller roads and through a couple of backroad-alleys. There was of course always the risk that this was some kind of trick played on stupid foreigners\u2026 In that case.. well he\u2019d always been a proponent of simply springing the trap and trusting the force. He walked down the three steps that put him into the shade of the doorway and knocked curtly on the door before activating the control panel. </p><p>The door opened smoothly with nary a sound to reveal a workroom with tables and shelves scattered with parts and pieces of flimsi with sketches of blueprints on them.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment and I\u2019ll be there,\u201d a young voice yelled from further inside. The sound came from an open doorway and curious Obi-Wan made his way over there moving carefully through the clutter - along the way he though he saw a half finished thermal detonator, but that couldn\u2019t be right. Coming to stand in the doorway he gasped at the hangar he\u2019d entered. Built into the ground the ceiling only rose as high as the rest of the house, but it was dug at least two stories into the ground creating a hangar large enough to fit a couple of medium sized freighters. A winding metal staircase lead to the ground, a ramp lead to a garage sized opening in the far wall and there were signs that the ceiling could open in the middle. Currently it held a single heavily modified freighter, a blue and white pod-racer in the corner, various speeder bikes in different states of repair and a dull red speeder with a pair of long legs sticking out from under it.</p><p>The legs turned out to belong to a tall young man when he pushed out from under the speeder. He noticed the brown robed Jedi unnervingly quickly and waved him down.</p><p>\u201cCome on, if you\u2019re that impatient, you might as well come down here.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan felt a stab of annoyance at being called impatient but quickly let the force have it. As he neared the young man, he noted the bright blue eyes, the prominent scars from both knife and blaster wounds on his bare muscled arms and the curly dark blond hair gathered in a ponytail at his neck. </p><p>Not taking his eyes off Obi-Wan he wiped the worst of the oil off his strong hands with the piece of maybe-once-upon-a-time-white piece of cloth hanging at his belt. </p><p>\u201cGreetings of double-noon, Stranger.\u201d He held out a mostly clean hand, with an offer of his name; \u201cAnakin Skywalker.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan took the proffered hand in a firm handshake and was so startled by this Anakin Skywalker\u2019s bright blazing presence in the force that his own introduction came as a dazed afterthought \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi.\u201d</p><p>Skywalker raised an eyebrow at his belated response as if accepting the strangeness of it then moved on, letting go of Obi-Wan\u2019s hand. His presence muted a bit with the loss of contact but now that Obi-Wan was aware of it, he couldn\u2019t erase it from his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Obi-Wan from the Core? Your hyperdrive break down?\u201d His smile was small but friendly.</p><p>Obi-Wan scoffed and shook his head, \u201cI almost wish it was so, that would make this at least somewhat make sense.\u201d He paused for a moment gathering his thoughts. \u201cActually I was sent here to negotiate with Jabba the Hutt to allow the Republic the use of the trade routes near Tatooine.\u201d</p><p>Skywalker\u2019s gaze sharpened and the smile fell. \u201cYou\u2019re a jedi.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan wordlessly held the left side of his cloak away from his body revealing his lightsaber. </p><p>\u201cI must admit that I was confused, when I asked around and only got referred to \u2018the mechanic\u2019, a very tight-lipped community you got here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Anakin laughed, the strange tension breaking. \u201cThey have got to stop doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what? If I may ask?\u201d</p><p>Anakin\u2019s smile turned sharp. \u201cUsing me to vet strangers.\u201d </p><p>The threat was clear in his tone and while Obi-Wan was confident he could beat the young man in a fight, he also had a bad feeling it would not be easy. </p><p>Skywalker turned around suddenly, breaking the tension as suddenly as he\u2019d created it.</p><p>\u201cCome along then, if you want someone to negotiate with, you\u2019re gonna wanna meet my mother.\u201d</p><p>Mystified he followed Skywalker around as he picked up a few indefinable smaller projects and put them in a dark brown messenger bag. In black stitching in the bottom left corner almost invisible against the dark brown was that symbol of the broken circle again. </p><p>He slung the bag over his shoulder and took the winding staircase in only five leaps using the railing to propel himself upwards. Obi-Wan closed his mouth. Not one to be outdone he used the force to assist him as he copied the feat. Landing in front of Skywalker he straigthened his robes and raised an eyebrow, wordlessly saying \u2018shall we?\u2019.</p><p>Skywalker grinned in delight but didn\u2019t comment. He weaved through the workroom clutter with the grace of familiarity (and maybe a little extra). He gestured for Obi-Wan to leave ahead of him as he locked up the shop.

As he neared the young man, he noted the bright blue eyes, the prominent scars from both knife and blaster wounds on his bare muscled arms and the curly dark blond hair gathered in a ponytail at his neck. </p><p>Not taking his eyes off Obi-Wan he wiped the worst of the oil off his strong hands with the piece of maybe-once-upon-a-time-white piece of cloth hanging at his belt. </p><p>\u201cGreetings of double-noon, Stranger.\u201d He held out a mostly clean hand, with an offer of his name; \u201cAnakin Skywalker.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan took the proffered hand in a firm handshake and was so startled by this Anakin Skywalker\u2019s bright blazing presence in the force that his own introduction came as a dazed afterthought \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi.\u201d</p><p>Skywalker raised an eyebrow at his belated response as if accepting the strangeness of it then moved on, letting go of Obi-Wan\u2019s hand. His presence muted a bit with the loss of contact but now that Obi-Wan was aware of it, he couldn\u2019t erase it from his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Obi-Wan from the Core? Your hyperdrive break down?\u201d His smile was small but friendly.</p><p>Obi-Wan scoffed and shook his head, \u201cI almost wish it was so, that would make this at least somewhat make sense.\u201d He paused for a moment gathering his thoughts. \u201cActually I was sent here to negotiate with Jabba the Hutt to allow the Republic the use of the trade routes near Tatooine.\u201d</p><p>Skywalker\u2019s gaze sharpened and the smile fell. \u201cYou\u2019re a jedi.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan wordlessly held the left side of his cloak away from his body revealing his lightsaber. </p><p>\u201cI must admit that I was confused, when I asked around and only got referred to \u2018the mechanic\u2019, a very tight-lipped community you got here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Anakin laughed, the strange tension breaking. \u201cThey have got to stop doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what? If I may ask?\u201d</p><p>Anakin\u2019s smile turned sharp. \u201cUsing me to vet strangers.\u201d </p><p>The threat was clear in his tone and while Obi-Wan was confident he could beat the young man in a fight, he also had a bad feeling it would not be easy. </p><p>Skywalker turned around suddenly, breaking the tension as suddenly as he\u2019d created it.</p><p>\u201cCome along then, if you want someone to negotiate with, you\u2019re gonna wanna meet my mother.\u201d</p><p>Mystified he followed Skywalker around as he picked up a few indefinable smaller projects and put them in a dark brown messenger bag. In black stitching in the bottom left corner almost invisible against the dark brown was that symbol of the broken circle again. </p><p>He slung the bag over his shoulder and took the winding staircase in only five leaps using the railing to propel himself upwards. Obi-Wan closed his mouth. Not one to be outdone he used the force to assist him as he copied the feat. Landing in front of Skywalker he straigthened his robes and raised an eyebrow, wordlessly saying \u2018shall we?\u2019.</p><p>Skywalker grinned in delight but didn\u2019t comment. He weaved through the workroom clutter with the grace of familiarity (and maybe a little extra). He gestured for Obi-Wan to leave ahead of him as he locked up the shop. They\u2019d only walked a few steps into the small alley when Skywalker stopped, eyes going distant. Obi-Wan reached out with the force and to his wonder felt Skywalker doing the same - he didn\u2019t seem to feel any of what Skywalker seemed to feel though.</p><p>He shook his head as he came out of it. Looking to Obi-Wan with a doubtful glance. \u00a0\u201cDo you have shelter for the storm tonight?\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan knew better than to really doubt the words of the force sensitive native, but couldn\u2019t help but remark; \u201cthe forecast didn\u2019t mention any sand storms.\u201d</p><p>Anakin quirked a sardonic smile, \u201cThe dessert doesn\u2019t care much for forecasts. So that\u2019s a no to having shelter then. You\u2019ll just have to stay with us then.\u201d</p><p>They moved through the streets, people nodded and smiled at Anakin, the respect was obvious and Obi-Wan just got more and more curious. At one point Anakin gestured at an obviously armed twilek woman wearing no distinct uniform just loose casual clothing, despite that Obi-Wan got the feeling she was part of local security. She walked over to them and Anakin exchanged some words lowly in what sounded like Huttese and the woman nodded before returning to her place at the wall. As they continued on Obi-Wan looked back to see her with her right hand by her ear as if she was talking into a comm. </p><p>The dwellings got smaller the further they went, still the same white rock all the buildings seemed to be made from but definitely a poorer part of town. They entered a part of the city which seemed distinct and rather isolated from the rest in which the dwellings outwardly only consisted of a door and it was like more dwellings had been slapped on top later as necessary and connected to the ground with slim stairs protruding from the house walls without railings.</p><p>Anakin walked them to the end of the line and into one of the bottom dwellings. He shook his loose clothing and stepped out of his sandals before entering the home. </p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m home. I brought a guest.\u201d He called. </p><p>Obi-Wan mimicked Anakin\u2019s obvious attempt to get rid of as much of the sand as possible and pried his boots off before entering. It was quite a relief. </p><p>\u2018Mom\u2019 turned out to be a middle aged woman with brown hair and kind eyes in a weathered face that spoke of the hardships of the desert.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home early Ani, how was work?\u201d </p><p>\u201cEh it was fine, nothing too exciting happening. We\u2019re gonna have a storm tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you brought home a guest?\u201d It was a pointed question, the real thinly veiled question was why he hadn\u2019t introduced his guest. Anakin waved a hand dismissively as if saying Obi-Wan could introduce himself and walked further into the room. Obi-Wan was feeling increasingly more confused as time went on so he fell back on the basics; courtesy.</p><p>\u201cApologies Ma\u2019am,\u201d he bowed politely, \u201cI am Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight, I was sent here to negotiate the usage of the trade routes near Tattooing for the Republic, but I have been continuously referred to your son and now he\u2019s referred me to you.\u201d He spread his hands in surrender. </p><p>Anakin\u2019s laughter could be heard from a distant room. The mother cast an irritated glance in the direction Anakin had gone before taking pity on Obi-Wan.</p><p>\u201cDo come in, I\u2019m terribly sorry about my son\u2019s behaviour. My name is Shmi Skywalker. I assume you came to negotiate with Jabba?\u201d</p><p>She indicated a chair in the kitchen for him to sit down in.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, mrs Skywalker.\u201d \u201cJust Shmi please, we\u2019re not big on formality here.\u201d Obi-Wan sighed in surrender; \u201cShmi then.\u201d</p><p>She nodded satisfied before busying herself with making some warm drink that filled the room with delightful spices. </p><p>\u201cJabba died 6 months ago during the initial revolts,\u201d she commented offhandedly.</p><p>Obi-Wan\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cHow could we not have heard of this? Revolts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatooine is pretty isolated, even from the Hutts. Jabba while powerful didn\u2019t interact much with the other Hutts and would often ignore their calls.

He closed his eyes, basking in the flavors and smells. Like this, he could almost imagine he was home enjoying a new tea blend. No war. Just home from negotiating a simple trade dispute.

                "content": "<p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8MQShtNp3ugFoWf_s_2mHQ\">@fialleril</a> a little something for you, for writing such inspiring metas. I hope you like :)</p><p>Jedi Knight and General of the 212th, Obi-Wan Kenobi, would readily admit he was confused. For one he had expected to meet with Jabba the Hutt in negotiating the use of the Hutt&rsquo;s trade routes in the outer-rim - there were no Hutts to be found and he kept being referred to go see some mechanic? And that was another thing that was strange; the atmosphere here seemed so clear &nbsp;-like the air after a thunderstorm, like a fresh start. It wasn&rsquo;t like people were smiling or overly friendly, they were tough people living in a dessert, but he was met with equal parts kindness and suspiciousness. Rarely had he met a people more secretive and all anyone seemed willing to do was direct him towards this &ldquo;mechanic&rdquo;.</p><p>And so the Jedi General walked through the dusty streets getting inquisitive glances from natives whose conversations halted as he passed. It should have been unnerving, that attention, but still the force itself was light and clear here - certainly not what he would have expected of Tatooine rumored as it was to be a hive of scum and villainy second only to Nar Shadda. </p><p>Mos Espa, the biggest city on the dessert planet wasn&rsquo;t as he&rsquo;d expected either. Sure it had the flat-roofed light buildings set slightly into the ground so as to make for shadeful cool places during the midday heat, but they were decorated with colorful illustrations and symbols he had no context for understanding the meaning of - a circle broken into seven parts were a popular one. Colored fabric hung from window sills and rooftops almost like banners of allegiance ranging from black and white to green, blue, red and orange - no purple nuances at all though and he idly wondered why&hellip; It gave the streets the look of the aftermath of some kind of celebration nobody had bothered to clean up. Obi-Wan had to admit it made for interesting scenery.</p><p>He ran his hand over some carvings almost invisible against the white rock of a doorway and the force whispered protection at him so low he only heard it because he&rsquo;d stopped to actually listen. Fascinated he looked around and he could now glean other carvings hidden in doorways and window sills and now that he knew what to listen for the wishes of the carvers where a harmonious song at the edge of his hearing; protection, love, family, home.</p><p>Almost in a daze he followed the directions to the mechanic always half an ear on the song. He stopped in front of a nondescript doorway. A sign with a multitool swayed lightly in the breeze over the doorway - he assumed that meant he was in the right place. Really he would have expected someone this important as this mechanic apparently was, would be situauted on the main street and not down a dozen smaller roads and through a couple of backroad-alleys. There was of course always the risk that this was some kind of trick played on stupid foreigners&hellip; In that case.. well he&rsquo;d always been a proponent of simply springing the trap and trusting the force. He walked down the three steps that put him into the shade of the doorway and knocked curtly on the door before activating the control panel. </p><p>The door opened smoothly with nary a sound to reveal a workroom with tables and shelves scattered with parts and pieces of flimsi with sketches of blueprints on them.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a moment and I&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; a young voice yelled from further inside. The sound came from an open doorway and curious Obi-Wan made his way over there moving carefully through the clutter - along the way he though he saw a half finished thermal detonator, but that couldn&rsquo;t be right. Coming to stand in the doorway he gasped at the hangar he&rsquo;d entered. Built into the ground the ceiling only rose as high as the rest of the house, but it was dug at least two stories into the ground creating a hangar large enough to fit a couple of medium sized freighters. A winding metal staircase lead to the ground, a ramp lead to a garage sized opening in the far wall and there were signs that the ceiling could open in the middle. Currently it held a single heavily modified freighter, a blue and white pod-racer in the corner, various speeder bikes in different states of repair and a dull red speeder with a pair of long legs sticking out from under it.</p><p>The legs turned out to belong to a tall young man when he pushed out from under the speeder. He noticed the brown robed Jedi unnervingly quickly and waved him down.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, if you&rsquo;re that impatient, you might as well come down here.&rdquo;</p><p>Obi-Wan felt a stab of annoyance at being called impatient but quickly let the force have it. As he neared the young man, he noted the bright blue eyes, the prominent scars from both knife and blaster wounds on his bare muscled arms and the curly dark blond hair gathered in a ponytail at his neck. </p><p>Not taking his eyes off Obi-Wan he wiped the worst of the oil off his strong hands with the piece of maybe-once-upon-a-time-white piece of cloth hanging at his belt. </p><p>&ldquo;Greetings of double-noon, Stranger.&rdquo; He held out a mostly clean hand, with an offer of his name; &ldquo;Anakin Skywalker.&rdquo;</p><p>Obi-Wan took the proffered hand in a firm handshake and was so startled by this Anakin Skywalker&rsquo;s bright blazing presence in the force that his own introduction came as a dazed afterthought &ldquo;Obi-Wan Kenobi.&rdquo;</p><p>Skywalker raised an eyebrow at his belated response as if accepting the strangeness of it then moved on, letting go of Obi-Wan&rsquo;s hand.
