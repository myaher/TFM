The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Chapter Seven</b></p><p>The minute Dan\u2019s skis are pried off, he limps across the lobby to the reception desk, and flops down into the seat, groaning. \u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re expecting an apology for \u2018forcing\u2019 you to come skiing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Dan says, suppressing an eye roll. \u201cIt was my own stupid fault, I know that. Should\u2019ve listened about the bloody skins.\u201d </p><p>As if this has reminded him, Phil turns back to where they\u2019ve rested their skis against the wall, and begins peeling off the skins from the undersides. \u201cHow\u2019s the ankle feeling now?\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s caught in a steel vice, and someone\u2019s slowly grinding the crank,\u201d Dan replies, lifting his foot onto his knee so he can examine it for himself. </p><p>\u201cWere you a drama kid at school, by any chance?\u201d </p><p>Dan shoots a glare towards Phil, but it only glances off his back as he makes his way to the stairs. \u201cSee you later, then,\u201d Dan mutters.</p><p>Phil pauses for a fraction of a second, then continues on his way without turning round. For a few minutes, Dan prods and turns his ankle experimentally, testing the limits of his flexibility. If he&rsquo;s unable to get up and down those stairs, he\u2019s in huge trouble. He\u2019s so focused on the ankle that he doesn\u2019t notice Phil reappearing until the bottom stair creaks. In his hand he\u2019s got an ice pack, which he hands to Dan across the desk, wordlessly. </p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce it for twenty minutes or so,\u201d Phil instructs. \u201cShould help with the swelling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Dan mutters, hardly listening as he wraps the long pack around the injured area. </p><p>\u201cThen I think we should go in the hot tub.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, ok- woah, what?\u201d </p><p>Phil now has both forearms on the lip of the desk; there\u2019s that hint of a hidden smile tucked beneath his expression. \u201cSoaking it for a while would help with the pain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you need to accompany me because\u2026?\u201d </p><p>Like a ray of sunlight through thick storm clouds, Phil\u2019s smile breaks through. He leans up, rolling his shoulders. \u201cI just heaved your bony body a mile across mountain. My muscles could use a soak too.\u201d </p><p>Chastened, Dan shrinks into his seat. \u201cRight. Of course, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWorried I\u2019m going to ogle you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cN-no! I just\u2026 I dunno, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even supposed to go in the hot tub. I\u2019m not a guest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell,\u201d Phil says, then actually <i>winks.</i> He stretches his arms behind his back then, chest puffing out, and says, \u201cright, I\u2019m gonna grab a drink and change. Meet you out there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, I should get that for you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, you\u2019re literally hobbled. I can handle getting a drink out of the kitchen fridge.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, grateful for this small allowance. \u201cRight. Um, fine then. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll meet you out there.\u201d </p><p>Phil leaves, heading once more for the stairs, and Dan watches him intently, stomach freely somersaulting as he tries to imagine how the next few hours of his life will go, sat in a hot tub with Phil Novokoric. What will they talk about? The weather? There\u2019s only so much to say when it\u2019s perpetually freezing. What have they even been talking about all day so far? Dan doesn\u2019t remember many\u00a0 awkward silences, but he does remember a lingering feeling of frustration beneath every word they spoke to one another. </p><p>The throbbing in his ankle has been blurring Dan\u2019s thoughts into a mess of confusion, particularly on the journey back, but now that the ice pack has begun numbing the pain, all Dan can remember is the sensation of being tucked so tightly against Phil\u2019s side. For a long time, they\u2019d been closely pressed together, and Phil hadn\u2019t so much as complained. Well, he\u2019d said that Dan was \u2018bony\u2019, but it sounded more like an excuse to speak than a real objection. </p><p>For several minutes, Dan replays the long walk back he and Phil shared, trying to remember everything he\u2019d said, and whether he should be embarrassed or regretful. It\u2019s only when he glances at the clock on the wall that he realises time is ticking by, and he\u2019s still fully dressed right down to his coat. With a panicked look towards the mezzanine, he removes the ice pack and stands carefully, managing to limp his way to the side of the room, where the stock cupboard is, tucked out of sight behind a hidden door in the wood-panelled wall. </p><p>In here, he finds a fresh robe, a pair of white swim trunks, and some of the hotel branded slippers. Mona ensures that all of these items are available to guests that might have overlooked packing certain essentials. It\u2019s surprising how often they\u2019re asked for spare swimwear that guests have forgotten in a haste to make their plane. Dan didn\u2019t bring any swim trunks with him because he\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d need them up here, so spares it is. He carries the garments into Mona\u2019s office, peeling off his many layers\u00a0 and slipping on the trunks. </p><p>He already feels alarmingly naked, so dons the slippers and robe, tying it tightly. Before he leaves the office, he catches sight of himself in Mona\u2019s small, square mirror tacked to the wall. His hair is wild, mussed up by the hat he\u2019d been wearing, so he runs a hand through it, though it makes virtually no difference. His lips seem fuller, pinkened by the icy chill, and his cheeks have a flush to them that won\u2019t seem to go away. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s his rosacea, this time. </p><p>Turning from his reflection abruptly, Dan focuses on making his way out of the office, then through the lobby to the back door without injuring himself further. Through a technique Dan decides is called \u2018furniture balancing\u2019 he manages to get himself to the back door without putting much weight on his right foot. </p><p>When he gets outside, Phil is already in the jacuzzi. It\u2019s an in-ground tub, hexagonal in shape, with wooden skirting that Dan has to go over with a large broom and sweep the snow off every morning. There\u2019s a bottle of champagne sat on this skirting, and two glasses beside Phil\u2019s elbow, which rests out of the water. </p><p>He turns to Dan, hearing his slow, limping approach. \u201cThought you\u2019d chickened out,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d Dan says, teeth already chattering. </p><p>Why had he not thought about the fact he\u2019s got virtually no clothes on before now? He wraps his robe tighter around himself. The hairs on his legs are totally erect and he feels like the moisture in his eyes is freezing over. </p><p>\u201cHence the hot tub,\u201d Phil says, snorting. </p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, but edges closer, hands tucked into his armpits. Crap, Phil is\u2026 very naked. He has swim trunks on obviously, a deep red blur beneath the water, but Dan can see every hair brushed across his broad chest. He can see the soft bulges of his arm muscles, and collarbones and shoulder blades and long, pale legs. Dan doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s staring until Phil meets his eyes. </p><p>\u201cAre you doing some delayed satisfaction kink-thing? Get in before you contract hypothermia.\u201d </p><p>Blushing mostly at hearing Phil say \u2018kink\u2019 which seems somehow unsavoury and titillating at once, Dan says nothing, but tugs at the knot of his robe. He turns away as he removes it, and throws it over the handlebar of the steps, on top of Phil\u2019s. He shucks off his slippers, wriggles his bruised ankle experimentally - the purpling colour looks far worse now - and then carefully plunges it into the water. </p><p>Instantly, relief overwhelms him, which is annoying, because it means Phil was right. He can\u2019t help the sigh of relief that escapes him even so, blissed out as the throbbing pain recedes, chased off by the pins-and-needles heat of the hot water. So as not to put any weight on the injured ankle, Dan sits down on the top step, and lowers himself in that way. When he\u2019s submerged to his waist, he looks up and finds Phil watching him amusedly. </p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe scalding-heat-freezing-cold combo is a nice distraction from the agony, yes.\u201d </p><p>Phil titters, turning back to the view of the mountains in front of them. He picks up the bottle from behind him, and Dan can see the muscles in his back twisting and sliding. He has to force himself not to stare; it\u2019s not because of any sexual desire of course, just that Dan\u2019s so unused to seeing real muscle definition, honed by actual effort put in from exercise. When he turns back, Dan\u2019s eyes fall to the bottle, and he balks. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that like a five-hundred-euro bottle of champagne?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Phil says, peeling off the foil. \u201cMy <i>hubby</i> can cover it.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s no mistaking the acidity in his tone. Dan hasn\u2019t needed it spelled out for him so far, Phil\u2019s reluctance and soured face whenever he mentions the name is enough to glean that the subject of Sir Nikolai Novokoric is off-limits. Dan clamps his mouth shut obediently, watching as Phil pops the cork, and pours some into one of the glasses, then takes the other, and pours some into that too. </p><p>He hands one to Dan, who takes it, baffled. \u201cWait, this is for me?\u201d </p><p>Phil gives him a strange look. \u201cDid you think I brought two glasses out here for myself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, well it\u2019s kind of you but, um,\u201d Dan falters, distracted by the cool drips of condensation forming on the outside of the glass. As he inhales, the sparkle of the champagne fizzes on his tongue, mingled with the chlorine steam. \u201cI-I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m technically working.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yes, I forgot you\u2019ve got to stay alert for all the many guests that might need your assistance.\u201d</p><p>Conflicted, Dan watches Phil tip some of the cool, bubbling liquid into his mouth. His prominent Adams apple bobs, and immediately all Dan can think is that he needs to be not-sober. He takes a sip. </p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s divine,\u201d Dan mutters, remembering as it slips down his throat that this champagne costs more than he has had in his bank account for some time. \u201cRemind me to put this on your tab or Mona will freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can pay you for it right now in cash, if it\u2019s easier,\u201d Phil replies smoothly. </p><p>\u201cHow the other half live,\u201d Dan can\u2019t stop himself saying back. </p><p>Phil shoots him a narrow-eyed look that Dan avoids by sipping more champagne. \u201cIt\u2019s not my money.\u201d </p><p>With a great deal of effort, Dan manages not to respond to this ludicrous statement. If you marry someone, what\u2019s theirs is yours. That\u2019s just how it works. For a while, they stew in the painfully awkward silence this money-talk has churned up, sipping from their glasses and pretending to be engrossed in the view. Eventually, Phil shifts across his seat and reaches to a control pad, turning the jets on. The noise of the frothing, bubbling water obliterates the silence in a way that should be unsettling, but actually has Dan melting in relief.\u00a0</p><p>Over the cacophony, Phil shouts, \u201cso, what\u2019s your story then?\u201d</p><p>Dan looks at him, surprised. \u201cMy story?\u201d he asks, voice raised.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn my experience, people don\u2019t tend to take jobs high up in the mountains on their own on a whim,\u201d he says loudly. </p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Dan shouts, prickling with annoyance, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>This admission seems to give Phil enough reason to pause. For a moment, Dan doesn\u2019t elaborate, relishing the look of surprise and intrigue on Phil\u2019s face. He sips his drink, quietly basking in the cloak of enigma he\u2019s draped around himself. Inevitably however, he can\u2019t stand the silence stretching. He doesn\u2019t particularly want to divulge details about his hideous life to someone he can barely stand, but the champagne is already loosening his tongue, and here, dwarfed by the enormous peaks ahead of them, his old existence and all its many aspects that once seemed so intolerable now seem&hellip; wholly insignificant.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just looked around one day and realised\u2026 there\u2019s not a single thing about my life that I truly enjoy,\u201d Dan says, words spilling from his mouth like they\u2019ve been gathered there for days, waiting for a chance to emerge. Bubbles tickle the back of his throat as he swallows another mouthful of delicious champagne. \u201cSo, I dropped it all. Hurled out a load of applications to customer service jobs in different places. I\u2019ve worked in retail and waiting jobs part-time for years, so I knew I\u2019d have no trouble landing one. Mona emailed me asking if I\u2019d be up for something&hellip; remote, and I knew it was the dumbest thing I could possibly do. So I said yes.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd here you are,\u201d Phil murmurs. </p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>\u201cSo what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat was it that wasn\u2019t making you happy? Hated your boss? No one swiping right on your Tinder profile?\u201d </p><p>Dan thinks about asking him exactly why it\u2019s any of his damn business, but again that sense of his old life\u2019s unimportance washes over him. It laps at his skin like the water he\u2019s submerged in, reminding him of how small they are, how similarly ignored by the universe because of their size, their position on the planet. What does it even matter if he tells this man everything? He\u2019s only asking to fill the time the two of them have got to kill whilst they\u2019re alone up here. It\u2019s not like Dan\u2019s dull, mediocre story will mean anything to someone like Phil Novokoric; who would he bother to tell? Dan sinks a bit further down, so his shoulders are underwater, and tilts his head back to look into the sky. </p><p>\u201cI was at university, studying law,\u201d Dan says, mouth twisting into a frown as he remembers the endless thick piles of reading, the leather briefcase his Dad had bought for him to look \u2018professional\u2019. \u201cI only chose it because my Dad told me it was a solid career path. I had a girlfriend. Met her at a party in the first week I was there. Honestly, I don\u2019t think she even liked me that much. She just knew I was on track to be a lawyer, she found me attractive enough I guess, and that was enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love her?\u201d </p><p>Dan hesitates, the question seeming alien. He\u2019s never actually thought about it before, he realises with a start. He wonders why Phil even wants to know such a strange, intimate detail. \u201cNot in the way I should have,\u201d he answers carefully. He pauses, wondering if he\u2019s really about to say the next bit when he\u2019s never been able to admit it aloud to anyone. Somehow, up here in the atmosphere, buoyed by alcohol and thin, oxygen-starved air, it just doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal. \u201cTurns out she\u2019s not really\u2026 my type.\u201d </p><p>The jets, on a two-minute timer, suddenly cease bubbling. The silence that follows, punctuated only by the slight swilling of water, is excruciating. The weight of his sort-of-admission seems to drag him deeper into the water; why had he said anything at all? Why had he just ripped off his shroud of anonymity for this sneery, snobbish stranger? Before Dan can explode into a full-blown panic attack, Phil chuckles. Dan sits up straight, staring at him in dismay.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming out to me?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>Dan splutters, reddening rapidly. \u201cAre you <i>laughing</i> at me coming out to you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Phil says, though he\u2019s <i>still</i> laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA little what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell. You\u2019re not exactly subtle. I can tell you fancy me.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201c<i>What</i>?!\u201d </p><p>In response, Phil just holds Dan\u2019s gaze as he downs the remains of his glass. </p><p>\u201cThat is- I absolutely do <i>not</i>-\u201d Dan is so red that he feels like a slowly boiling lobster. Too outraged to trust himself to respond properly, Dan puts down his glass and splashily shimmies over to the steps, hauling himself out. \u201cGod, you are unbelievable!\u201d he shouts as he goes. \u201cEvery time I think you might show a shade of decency, you just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil calls, a bubble of laughter in his voice. </p><p>Dan pauses, mostly because he\u2019s finding it pretty difficult to make it up the steps in his crippled state. He turns, shivering with cold and fury, back to the man. Phil is staring at him with a combination of pity and amusement, which is an unusual thing to be able to recognise, though Dan is quickly learning that Phil\u2019s face is deceptively expressive, but only when he deigns to actually show emotion. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking.\u201d</p><p>The tension leaks, treacly and slow, from Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Before Dan can beg the universe to create a whirlpool in this small hot tub and drown them both, Phil stands, water cascading from his body. He runs a hand through his damp hair, then picks up the bottle of champagne and his glass.</p><p>\u201cShall we move to the sauna?\u201d he asks, steam rising from the miles of his flawless, pale skin. </p><p>Stung with residual anger and humiliation, Dan just nods tightly, and manages to manoeuvre himself, with a fair bit of difficulty, up the steps. Phil follows after, lithe with grace and poise, but he doesn\u2019t attempt to overtake Dan as he makes his way across the short distance from the tub to the glass door of the sauna. </p><p>He does, however, dart his arm out to neatly pull the door open before Dan can reach out for it. He holds the door, allowing Dan to limp through, which is infuriatingly chivalrous of him, and Dan has a mind to tell him as much. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a damsel in distress,\u201d he says, collapsing on the nearest wooden bench. Immediately, the moisture in his mouth dries up; this small room is ridiculously arid. He comes in once a day to clean it, but there are only four benches, stacked on two levels, so it never takes long. He\u2019s never been good with heat, which is why he chose to disappear into the tundra rather than, say, the Indian Desert. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold doors for me and bring me ice packs or whatever.\u201d </p><p>Phil hands him his glass, which he must have scooped from the edge of the tub on his way. Dan scowls, but takes it anyway, and Phil pours some more champagne into it, then his own. </p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re sensitive,\u201d Phil says, slumping down onto the adjacent bench. \u201cI embarrassed you, huh?\u201d </p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cI just can\u2019t, like, understand you. You make me feel on edge.\u201d Phil raises an eyebrow, sipping his drink. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I bloody fancy you though, jeez. You\u2019re married. And a dick-brain.\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs. \u201cDick-brain?\u201d </p><p>Dan lowers his glass, displeased with himself for letting that one slip. \u201cProb\u2019ly shouldn\u2019t have said that out loud. Sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you think I\u2019m a dick-brain, but you just haven\u2019t said it out loud until now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d Dan shifts in his too-hot seat; the backs of his thighs are sticking to the wood. He turns to the burning coals in the corner, wondering if throwing himself upon them would be too dramatic. </p><p>\u201cLook, would it help if I divulged some personal crap too? Might help you to relax,\u201d Phil suggests. </p><p>\u201cAm I not normally relaxed?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, then leans back against the wall. \u201cNah, you\u2019re kind of\u2026\u201d he flaps his hand in the air. \u201cSkittish.\u201d </p><p>Hearing this description of himself is startling. He\u2019s never considered that other people might see his anxiety leaking out so obviously. Is Phil just a perceptive person, or is it plain as day that Dan is near constantly on edge, always worrying, never truly feeling he can let things go? </p><p>He forces himself to mimic Phil\u2019s stance, shoulders slumped, legs slightly apart, head lolling back against the wall behind him. \u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says after a while, in what he hopes is a nonchalant voice. \u201cTell me about your husband.\u201d </p><p>He can feel Phil\u2019s narrow-eyed stare, but Dan focuses resolutely on his glass of champagne, heart pounding because he\u2019s never said something so bold in his life. </p><p>\u201cAre you a reporter?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, of course not. Who the hell would I be reporting to up here?\u201d </p><p>This seems to placate Phil, though he still looks unhappy with the turn in conversation. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows nervously, scratching at his bare thigh where the droplets of pool water are trickling and evaporating. \u201cHow did it happen? Like\u2026 you met him at uni right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn the library,\u201d Phil confirms. There\u2019s a silence then, but Dan forces himself not to jump in and fill it, so that Phil will continue. It works. He sighs, shifting to slip a little further down the wall. \u201cI\u2019d heard gossip that some heir to Royalty was strutting about campus pretending to learn something. I didn\u2019t give it much thought, honestly.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s interest is now fully piqued. He tries not to look too keen for the next part of the story. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like him?\u201d </p><p>One of Phil\u2019s shoulders shrugs. \u201cMore like I just didn\u2019t care. I knew vaguely who he was from the news and stuff, but it just didn\u2019t seem anything to do with me. I liked my course, I liked my friends, I was doing well. I just didn\u2019t have time to obsess over some rich kid the way everyone else was.\u201d </p><p>This is all sounding disturbingly familiar. \u201cSo what changed?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was in the library one day, working,\u201d Phil replies in a quieter voice. His eyes slowly defocus, staring at the empty, gelatinous air hanging in the middle of the room. \u201cHe just came and sat next to me. He had an entourage of giggling first years lingering around him, sat at the next table over. Actually, it was annoying. I was trying to work. But he didn\u2019t disrupt me. He just sat there reading something, and I kept, like, <i>feeling</i> him look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn entourage?\u201d Dan asks, finding this hard to believe. \u201cSurely he\u2019s not that attractive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil fixes him with a curious stare. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what he looks like?\u201d </p><p>Dan tries to scrounge up Sir Nikolai\u2019s face in his mind. All that comes up is a blank, white face with generic features. He couldn\u2019t even say for sure what colour hair the guy has. He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t really read, like, celeb news.\u201d </p><p>For a fleeting second, something akin to respect passes across Phil\u2019s features, but it\u2019s gone so quickly Dan can\u2019t be sure if it was a heat-born mirage. \u201cWell, yeah. He\u2019s hot. Objectively speaking. Ask pretty much anyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says. For some reason, this makes him feel strangely irritated, like he wishes Phil would tack on to this statement that Nikolai is also vain or pretentious. \u201cSo, what, you got into a heated discussion about <i>Sartre</i> in the library caf\u00e9 and fell into his arms?\u201d </p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth quirks. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d He sips some champagne. \u201cHe asked me for a pen or something, I don\u2019t remember. It was just an excuse to talk to me, I think. He told me afterwards that he wasn\u2019t even reading the book he had with him. In retrospect, I reckon he probably came into the library to find someone sitting alone, that he could-\u201d Phil cuts himself off abruptly. He takes a larger gulp of champagne. \u201cAnyway. I was young, and he was gorgeous, and pretty intimidating. He asked me to go on a date with him, and I didn\u2019t wanna be the guy who said no to a date with the world\u2019s hottest, most eligible bachelor.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, chewing this over. He\u2019s desperate to probe further into whatever Phil had thought better about saying, but he\u2019s already teetering on the edge of his seat, sure that Phil is about to realise he\u2019s spewing too much. This is the kind of behind-the-scenes gold that maybe only a handful of people have heard. If he were the sort of person that sold gossip to tabloids, he\u2019d probably make a load of cash for this.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dan says as casually as he can. \u201cDid he intimidate you into marrying him, as well?\u201d </p><p>Phil snorts with laughter. \u201cOuch.\u201d </p><p>A sharp thrill runs through Dan, chased immediately by a pang of guilt. \u201cSorry. I just don\u2019t get it. Sure, he\u2019s rich, and apparently attractive, but marrying someone is\u2026 y\u2019know. Mad. You met him in <i>uni.</i>\u00a0And committed to be with him for the rest of your life.\u201d </p><p>A faint, amused smile graces Phil\u2019s lips. \u201cGuess where he took me on our first date?\u201d </p><p>Dan shrugs, not giving much thought to the unexpected question. \u201cDinner at some extravagant restaurant?\u201d </p><p>\u201cParis.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do for the second date?\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs. \u201cHe rented out a cinema and screened <i>Kill Bill</i>, which was my favourite film at the time. And he hired a Michelin star chef to provide us with cocktails and gourmet popcorn.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan shakes his head, marvelling. \u201cThat\u2019s insane. I\u2019ve never even <i>smelled</i> the amount of money he must have spent on that.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, musing. \u201cKind of a waste, too. We didn\u2019t watch much of the film, as far as I remember.\u201d </p><p>The temperature seems to rise a good few degrees; Dan is sure he\u2019s beginning to resemble a boiled sweet. \u201cI guess it must be pretty nice to have someone do all that for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, though,\u201d Phil replies, smile slipping. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. That much money is all smoke and mirrors. I was so young. I grew up in a working class family, took out a loan to go to uni like everyone else. I\u2019d never touched wealth like that. It was overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Dan considers this, letting Phil\u2019s words fold slowly into his champagne-gauzed mind. He hadn\u2019t been aware of Phil\u2019s background until now; he\u2019d just assumed he\u2019d grown up rich. It\u2019s bizarre to think that once, the two of them were probably quite similar. They might even have been friends before Nikolai swooped Phil off to a life of luxury. </p><p>\u201cI thought I was in love,\u201d Phil says, maybe to himself. He lifts the bottle of champagne, and refills his glass, then leans over to pour some into Dan\u2019s. \u201cBut it was infatuation. It\u2019s hard to discern if something\u2019s real when it\u2019s dripping in diamonds.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo&hellip;\u201d Dan chews his lip, wondering whether this is a step too far. In the end, the champagne decides to push the question out regardless. \u201cYou don\u2019t love him?\u201d</p><p>If Phil is annoyed by the intrusive question, he doesn\u2019t show it. He just shakes his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me either. So I don\u2019t feel too bad.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Dan says quietly. \u201cHe must have wanted you. He asked you to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wanted a story,\u201d Phil says, dejectedly. \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with fame. With being this renegade-Royal, upsetting his father and behaving obscenely. He announced that he was bi, but nobody cared. So he one-upped himself. Found the nearest nobody and seduced him with cash and grand gestures. You should\u2019ve seen the ring he gave me when he asked.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes fall to the ring on Phil\u2019s finger now. It\u2019s silver, and shiny, but simple, demure. Phil follows Dan\u2019s gaze. \u201cThis isn\u2019t it. The engagement ring is in a safe somewhere now. He let me choose something a bit less extravagant for the wedding, thank God.\u201d</p><p>The words\u00a0\u2018let me\u2019 leap out at Dan, making him frown.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine being married right now,\u201d Dan confesses. \u201cYou were my age, right?\u201d </p><p>So, <i>perhaps</i> Dan\u2019s done a little digging in his down time.\u00a0</p><p>Phil squints at him. \u201cI was twenty-one when we got married.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYounger than me, then. Is it weird?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m drowning in marital bliss, let\u2019s put it that way. His press agent sees him more than I do.\u201d </p><p>From the way Phil describes him, along with the vague bits and pieces Dan\u2019s gleaned from news articles over the years, he strongly suspects that Sir Nikolai is an even worse version of Phil himself. Arrogant, snobby, unfeeling. Why anyone would want to be associated with such a man, let alone be married to him, is entirely baffling. Then again, Dan supposes that Phil was absurdly young to have been expected to work this out. He\u2019d confused Sir Nikolai\u2019s grand, extravagant gestures for actual affection, as any ordinary twenty-one-year-old undoubtedly would. In the eyes of someone so naive to the perils of dating, Sir Nikolai probably seemed like some fairytale prince, rescuing Phil from a life of mundanity. Despite Dan\u2019s twenty-first year being spent firmly in the closet, with a girlfriend, he\u2019s not sure he would have been able to resist Sir Nikolai himself, back then. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to stay up here?\u201d Dan asks, still thinking. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you go and be with him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA good question,\u201d Phil says with a snort. \u201cI ask him that every time we speak. It\u2019s always something vague. The paparazzi are out for my blood. News of the two of us sighted together would overshadow whatever project he\u2019s currently working on. I\u2019d be bored to pieces trailing around after him. It\u2019s all bollocks. It\u2019s just easier for him if I\u2019m kept far away, only brought out when I need to be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 why here?\u201d Dan asks, gesturing to the door of the sauna, outside of which the mountain lies, stunning and ferocious. \u201cSurely he has mansions or castles he could stow you in?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cSure. Loads. It wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference, though. A cage is still a cage, no matter how shiny the bars. Initially he sold this place to me as a suite in a remote, exotic mountain retreat, available to me for as long as I liked. He told me the staff would wait on me hand and foot, that I could ski, totally undisturbed, and that I could stay there indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cWhen you put it like that, it sounds amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. He didn\u2019t mention that leaving was basically not allowed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot allowed,\u201d Dan repeats, not bothering to hide his disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling. That\u2019s how he treats his <i>husband</i>. Like you\u2019re a pet or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rich-kid mentality,\u201d Phil says, nodding. \u201cAlways greedy for the next shiny toy. He\u2019d stop at nothing to get me, but once he got me, he was bored. Locked me away in the toy box.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo just divorce him,\u201d Dan blurts. </p><p>In the next mortified second, Dan tries in vain to summon the Gods to turn back time. This champagne is unscrewing his inhibitions in a dangerous way. Phil, thankfully, just seems amused by his sudden boldness.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as that,\u201d he replies with gentle condescension. \u201cHe\u2019s got an army of lawyers that would fight tooth and nail to keep a messy divorce from happening. His reputation would suffer if anyone caught wind that I wasn\u2019t totally besotted with the darling of the Swiss monarchy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019d buy you off or something, to keep you quiet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMore likely they\u2019d just threaten to leave me with nothing,\u201d Phil says with a resigned sigh, suggesting he\u2019s thought about this a lot. \u201cCan you imagine if I tried to go up in a legal battle against someone that powerful? I come from nothing. I never even finished my degree. All my money comes from him. I don\u2019t have a place to live, no job, nothing. He owns me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck <i>that</i>.\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs, louder and fuller than Dan has heard since earlier at the bottom of the slope, what seems like a lifetime ago. The sauna is tilting gently from side to side, like it\u2019s bobbing on a calm sea. It\u2019s quite pleasant, like being rocked in a large, very warm cradle. To further this concept, Dan decides to lie down on the bench, staring up at the wooden ceiling. </p><p>\u201cNobody owns you, Phil,\u201d he\u2019s suddenly saying. \u201cYou can go back and finish your degree if you want. You\u2019re young. Too young to be stuck up here all alone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cInteresting that you don\u2019t seem to be taking your own advice,\u201d Phil points out.\u00a0</p><p>Dan tilts his head back, seeing Phil upside-down. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Phil sips more champagne, his amusement stretching across his upside-down mouth. </p><p>\u201c\u2018cause like\u2026\u201d Dan\u2019s mind swims; he can\u2019t remember his own arguments. Did he ever even have any? \u201cOkay, okay, fine. You\u2019re right. We\u2019re both hiding up here \u2018cause we can\u2019t face how scary reality is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Phil agrees. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought we\u2019d find common ground?\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, then sits up and drains the last of his glass. \u201cWouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I\u2019m still a dick-brain, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Dan hiccups. \u201cSorry, mate. Your husband\u2019s shit, but there\u2019s no excuse for rudeness.\u201d </p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cEven though I said sorry?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still rude to me!\u201d </p><p>Dan sets his glass down, then nearly knocks it off the bench as he attempts to get comfortable. Luckily, Phil swoops in and grabs it just in time. He\u2019s smiling, tickled by Dan\u2019s clumsiness. \u201cI used to be nice, you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight, sure. Before fame changed you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBefore I grew into a bitter old housewife thirty years too soon.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s smile wanes. There\u2019s a soft tugging in the vicinity of his heart. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. He can\u2019t seem to look away. \u201cYour eyes are crazy blue,\u201d he finds himself saying.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\u2019s awkward, answering cough should embarrass him, but it doesn\u2019t. \u201cI think we should probably call it a night, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p><p>Dan frowns. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not that late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten-thirty.\u201d </p><p>No, it can\u2019t possibly be. Phil peels his Apple Watch from his wrist and holds it out for Dan to see. \u201cChrist,\u201d Dan says, starting to gather up his towel - which has somehow slipped off somewhere in the midst of the alcohol induced chat. \u201cI should- I\u2019ve got to-\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s getting to his feet, mind already projecting ahead to the million tasks he needs to complete before he can call it a night. For fuck\u2019s sake, he\u2019s somehow spent the whole day slacking off on the slopes and in the hot tub. He\u2019s so lost in his own stupidity that he forgets to ease the weight on his ankle, and cries out as the pain lances through him. He topples to one side, and is immediately caught by two very warm, damp arms. </p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Phil says, like he always does.</p><p>Dan turns to look at him. His expression leaks his own shock that he jumped up to catch Dan at all. Slowly, Dan extricates himself, heart suddenly a kick drum reverberating through the cavity of his chest. </p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0</p><p>In silence, the two of them gather the bottle and glasses, then shuffle to the door. Phil ducks around Dan, who is slow from his limp, and reaches for the door. He shoves it. It doesn\u2019t move. He shoves it again. Nothing. </p><p>Phil turns to Dan, frowning. \u201cWon\u2019t open.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d Dan replies, heart sinking. </p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d Phil says with a shrug. </p><p>Dan reaches out, shoving at the door. It doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cShit,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cAre we locked in?\u201d </p><p>They\u2019ll dehydrate in less than twenty-four hours. Even quicker from the bottle of champagne they\u2019ve downed between them. He turns to Phil, eyes wide. </p><p>\u201cDid you not bring the key?\u201d Phil asks, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cKey?\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cI\u2019ve never known about- this is your bloody fault! I\u2019ve never even been in this sauna, you should have known we needed a key-\u201d</p><p>Dan cuts off. Phil is fighting a smile, lips pressed together. For whatever reason, Dan is pretty sure that he\u2019s about to commit a murder in the next few seconds. He takes a deep breath, and watches with rising levels of pure homicidal rage as Phil pulls on the door handle, and it glides open. </p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t resist,\u201d Phil says, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re too easy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI fucking hate you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I hate you, you hate me.

Should\u2019ve listened about the bloody skins.\u201d </p><p>As if this has reminded him, Phil turns back to where they\u2019ve rested their skis against the wall, and begins peeling off the skins from the undersides. \u201cHow\u2019s the ankle feeling now?\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cLike it\u2019s caught in a steel vice, and someone\u2019s slowly grinding the crank,\u201d Dan replies, lifting his foot onto his knee so he can examine it for himself. </p><p>\u201cWere you a drama kid at school, by any chance?\u201d </p><p>Dan shoots a glare towards Phil, but it only glances off his back as he makes his way to the stairs. \u201cSee you later, then,\u201d Dan mutters.</p><p>Phil pauses for a fraction of a second, then continues on his way without turning round. For a few minutes, Dan prods and turns his ankle experimentally, testing the limits of his flexibility. If he\u2019s unable to get up and down those stairs, he\u2019s in huge trouble. He\u2019s so focused on the ankle that he doesn\u2019t notice Phil reappearing until the bottom stair creaks. In his hand he\u2019s got an ice pack, which he hands to Dan across the desk, wordlessly. </p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce it for twenty minutes or so,\u201d Phil instructs. \u201cShould help with the swelling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Dan mutters, hardly listening as he wraps the long pack around the injured area. </p><p>\u201cThen I think we should go in the hot tub.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, ok- woah, what?\u201d </p><p>Phil now has both forearms on the lip of the desk; there\u2019s that hint of a hidden smile tucked beneath his expression. \u201cSoaking it for a while would help with the pain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you need to accompany me because\u2026?\u201d </p><p>Like a ray of sunlight through thick storm clouds, Phil\u2019s smile breaks through. He leans up, rolling his shoulders. \u201cI just heaved your bony body a mile across mountain. My muscles could use a soak too.\u201d </p><p>Chastened, Dan shrinks into his seat. \u201cRight. Of course, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWorried I\u2019m going to ogle you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cN-no! I just\u2026 I dunno, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even supposed to go in the hot tub. I\u2019m not a guest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell,\u201d Phil says, then actually <i>winks.</i> He stretches his arms behind his back then, chest puffing out, and says, \u201cright, I\u2019m gonna grab a drink and change. Meet you out there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, I should get that for you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, you\u2019re literally hobbled. I can handle getting a drink out of the kitchen fridge.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, grateful for this small allowance. \u201cRight. Um, fine then. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll meet you out there.\u201d </p><p>Phil leaves, heading once more for the stairs, and Dan watches him intently, stomach freely somersaulting as he tries to imagine how the next few hours of his life will go, sat in a hot tub with Phil Novokoric. What will they talk about? The weather? There\u2019s only so much to say when it\u2019s perpetually freezing. What have they even been talking about all day so far? Dan doesn\u2019t remember many\u00a0 awkward silences, but he does remember a lingering feeling of frustration beneath every word they spoke to one another. </p><p>The throbbing in his ankle has been blurring Dan\u2019s thoughts into a mess of confusion, particularly on the journey back, but now that the ice pack has begun numbing the pain, all Dan can remember is the sensation of being tucked so tightly against Phil\u2019s side. For a long time, they\u2019d been closely pressed together, and Phil hadn\u2019t so much as complained. Well, he\u2019d said that Dan was \u2018bony\u2019, but it sounded more like an excuse to speak than a real objection. </p><p>For several minutes, Dan replays the long walk back he and Phil shared, trying to remember everything he\u2019d said, and whether he should be embarrassed or regretful. It\u2019s only when he glances at the clock on the wall that he realises time is ticking by, and he\u2019s still fully dressed right down to his coat. With a panicked look towards the mezzanine, he removes the ice pack and stands carefully, managing to limp his way to the side of the room, where the stock cupboard is, tucked out of sight behind a hidden door in the wood-panelled wall. </p><p>In here, he finds a fresh robe, a pair of white swim trunks, and some of the hotel branded slippers. Mona ensures that all of these items are available to guests that might have overlooked packing certain essentials. It\u2019s surprising how often they\u2019re asked for spare swimwear that guests have forgotten in a haste to make their plane. Dan didn\u2019t bring any swim trunks with him because he\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d need them up here, so spares it is. He carries the garments into Mona\u2019s office, peeling off his many layers\u00a0 and slipping on the trunks. </p><p>He already feels alarmingly naked, so dons the slippers and robe, tying it tightly. Before he leaves the office, he catches sight of himself in Mona\u2019s small, square mirror tacked to the wall. His hair is wild, mussed up by the hat he\u2019d been wearing, so he runs a hand through it, though it makes virtually no difference. His lips seem fuller, pinkened by the icy chill, and his cheeks have a flush to them that won\u2019t seem to go away. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s his rosacea, this time. </p><p>Turning from his reflection abruptly, Dan focuses on making his way out of the office, then through the lobby to the back door without injuring himself further. Through a technique Dan decides is called \u2018furniture balancing\u2019 he manages to get himself to the back door without putting much weight on his right foot. </p><p>When he gets outside, Phil is already in the jacuzzi. It\u2019s an in-ground tub, hexagonal in shape, with wooden skirting that Dan has to go over with a large broom and sweep the snow off every morning. There\u2019s a bottle of champagne sat on this skirting, and two glasses beside Phil\u2019s elbow, which rests out of the water. </p><p>He turns to Dan, hearing his slow, limping approach. \u201cThought you\u2019d chickened out,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d Dan says, teeth already chattering. </p><p>Why had he not thought about the fact he\u2019s got virtually no clothes on before now? He wraps his robe tighter around himself. The hairs on his legs are totally erect and he feels like the moisture in his eyes is freezing over. </p><p>\u201cHence the hot tub,\u201d Phil says, snorting. </p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, but edges closer, hands tucked into his armpits. Crap, Phil is\u2026 very naked. He has swim trunks on obviously, a deep red blur beneath the water, but Dan can see every hair brushed across his broad chest. He can see the soft bulges of his arm muscles, and collarbones and shoulder blades and long, pale legs. Dan doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s staring until Phil meets his eyes. </p><p>\u201cAre you doing some delayed satisfaction kink-thing? Get in before you contract hypothermia.\u201d </p><p>Blushing mostly at hearing Phil say \u2018kink\u2019 which seems somehow unsavoury and titillating at once, Dan says nothing, but tugs at the knot of his robe. He turns away as he removes it, and throws it over the handlebar of the steps, on top of Phil\u2019s. He shucks off his slippers, wriggles his bruised ankle experimentally - the purpling colour looks far worse now - and then carefully plunges it into the water. </p><p>Instantly, relief overwhelms him, which is annoying, because it means Phil was right. He can\u2019t help the sigh of relief that escapes him even so, blissed out as the throbbing pain recedes, chased off by the pins-and-needles heat of the hot water. So as not to put any weight on the injured ankle, Dan sits down on the top step, and lowers himself in that way. When he\u2019s submerged to his waist, he looks up and finds Phil watching him amusedly. </p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe scalding-heat-freezing-cold combo is a nice distraction from the agony, yes.\u201d </p><p>Phil titters, turning back to the view of the mountains in front of them. He picks up the bottle from behind him, and Dan can see the muscles in his back twisting and sliding. He has to force himself not to stare; it\u2019s not because of any sexual desire of course, just that Dan\u2019s so unused to seeing real muscle definition, honed by actual effort put in from exercise. When he turns back, Dan\u2019s eyes fall to the bottle, and he balks. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that like a five-hundred-euro bottle of champagne?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Phil says, peeling off the foil. \u201cMy <i>hubby</i> can cover it.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s no mistaking the acidity in his tone. Dan hasn\u2019t needed it spelled out for him so far, Phil\u2019s reluctance and soured face whenever he mentions the name is enough to glean that the subject of Sir Nikolai Novokoric is off-limits. Dan clamps his mouth shut obediently, watching as Phil pops the cork, and pours some into one of the glasses, then takes the other, and pours some into that too. </p><p>He hands one to Dan, who takes it, baffled. \u201cWait, this is for me?\u201d </p><p>Phil gives him a strange look. \u201cDid you think I brought two glasses out here for myself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, well it\u2019s kind of you but, um,\u201d Dan falters, distracted by the cool drips of condensation forming on the outside of the glass. As he inhales, the sparkle of the champagne fizzes on his tongue, mingled with the chlorine steam. \u201cI-I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m technically working.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yes, I forgot you\u2019ve got to stay alert for all the many guests that might need your assistance.\u201d</p><p>Conflicted, Dan watches Phil tip some of the cool, bubbling liquid into his mouth. His prominent Adams apple bobs, and immediately all Dan can think is that he needs to be not-sober. He takes a sip. </p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s divine,\u201d Dan mutters, remembering as it slips down his throat that this champagne costs more than he has had in his bank account for some time. \u201cRemind me to put this on your tab or Mona will freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can pay you for it right now in cash, if it\u2019s easier,\u201d Phil replies smoothly. </p><p>\u201cHow the other half live,\u201d Dan can\u2019t stop himself saying back. </p><p>Phil shoots him a narrow-eyed look that Dan avoids by sipping more champagne. \u201cIt\u2019s not my money.\u201d </p><p>With a great deal of effort, Dan manages not to respond to this ludicrous statement. If you marry someone, what\u2019s theirs is yours. That\u2019s just how it works. For a while, they stew in the painfully awkward silence this money-talk has churned up, sipping from their glasses and pretending to be engrossed in the view. Eventually, Phil shifts across his seat and reaches to a control pad, turning the jets on. The noise of the frothing, bubbling water obliterates the silence in a way that should be unsettling, but actually has Dan melting in relief.\u00a0</p><p>Over the cacophony, Phil shouts, \u201cso, what\u2019s your story then?\u201d</p><p>Dan looks at him, surprised. \u201cMy story?\u201d he asks, voice raised.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn my experience, people don\u2019t tend to take jobs high up in the mountains on their own on a whim,\u201d he says loudly. </p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Dan shouts, prickling with annoyance, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>This admission seems to give Phil enough reason to pause. For a moment, Dan doesn\u2019t elaborate, relishing the look of surprise and intrigue on Phil\u2019s face. He sips his drink, quietly basking in the cloak of enigma he\u2019s draped around himself. Inevitably however, he can\u2019t stand the silence stretching. He doesn\u2019t particularly want to divulge details about his hideous life to someone he can barely stand, but the champagne is already loosening his tongue, and here, dwarfed by the enormous peaks ahead of them, his old existence and all its many aspects that once seemed so intolerable now seem\u2026 wholly insignificant.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just looked around one day and realised\u2026 there\u2019s not a single thing about my life that I truly enjoy,\u201d Dan says, words spilling from his mouth like they\u2019ve been gathered there for days, waiting for a chance to emerge. Bubbles tickle the back of his throat as he swallows another mouthful of delicious champagne. \u201cSo, I dropped it all. Hurled out a load of applications to customer service jobs in different places. I\u2019ve worked in retail and waiting jobs part-time for years, so I knew I\u2019d have no trouble landing one. Mona emailed me asking if I\u2019d be up for something\u2026 remote, and I knew it was the dumbest thing I could possibly do. So I said yes.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd here you are,\u201d Phil murmurs. </p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>\u201cSo what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat was it that wasn\u2019t making you happy? Hated your boss? No one swiping right on your Tinder profile?\u201d </p><p>Dan thinks about asking him exactly why it\u2019s any of his damn business, but again that sense of his old life\u2019s unimportance washes over him. It laps at his skin like the water he\u2019s submerged in, reminding him of how small they are, how similarly ignored by the universe because of their size, their position on the planet. What does it even matter if he tells this man everything? He\u2019s only asking to fill the time the two of them have got to kill whilst they\u2019re alone up here. It\u2019s not like Dan\u2019s dull, mediocre story will mean anything to someone like Phil Novokoric; who would he bother to tell? Dan sinks a bit further down, so his shoulders are underwater, and tilts his head back to look into the sky. </p><p>\u201cI was at university, studying law,\u201d Dan says, mouth twisting into a frown as he remembers the endless thick piles of reading, the leather briefcase his Dad had bought for him to look \u2018professional\u2019. \u201cI only chose it because my Dad told me it was a solid career path. I had a girlfriend. Met her at a party in the first week I was there. Honestly, I don\u2019t think she even liked me that much. She just knew I was on track to be a lawyer, she found me attractive enough I guess, and that was enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love her?\u201d </p><p>Dan hesitates, the question seeming alien. He\u2019s never actually thought about it before, he realises with a start. He wonders why Phil even wants to know such a strange, intimate detail. \u201cNot in the way I should have,\u201d he answers carefully. He pauses, wondering if he\u2019s really about to say the next bit when he\u2019s never been able to admit it aloud to anyone. Somehow, up here in the atmosphere, buoyed by alcohol and thin, oxygen-starved air, it just doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal. \u201cTurns out she\u2019s not really\u2026 my type.\u201d </p><p>The jets, on a two-minute timer, suddenly cease bubbling. The silence that follows, punctuated only by the slight swilling of water, is excruciating. The weight of his sort-of-admission seems to drag him deeper into the water; why had he said anything at all? Why had he just ripped off his shroud of anonymity for this sneery, snobbish stranger? Before Dan can explode into a full-blown panic attack, Phil chuckles. Dan sits up straight, staring at him in dismay.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming out to me?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>Dan splutters, reddening rapidly. \u201cAre you <i>laughing</i> at me coming out to you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Phil says, though he\u2019s <i>still</i> laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA little what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell. You\u2019re not exactly subtle. I can tell you fancy me.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201c<i>What</i>?!\u201d </p><p>In response, Phil just holds Dan\u2019s gaze as he downs the remains of his glass. </p><p>\u201cThat is- I absolutely do <i>not</i>-\u201d Dan is so red that he feels like a slowly boiling lobster. Too outraged to trust himself to respond properly, Dan puts down his glass and splashily shimmies over to the steps, hauling himself out. \u201cGod, you are unbelievable!\u201d he shouts as he goes. \u201cEvery time I think you might show a shade of decency, you just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil calls, a bubble of laughter in his voice. </p><p>Dan pauses, mostly because he\u2019s finding it pretty difficult to make it up the steps in his crippled state. He turns, shivering with cold and fury, back to the man. Phil is staring at him with a combination of pity and amusement, which is an unusual thing to be able to recognise, though Dan is quickly learning that Phil\u2019s face is deceptively expressive, but only when he deigns to actually show emotion. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking.\u201d</p><p>The tension leaks, treacly and slow, from Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Before Dan can beg the universe to create a whirlpool in this small hot tub and drown them both, Phil stands, water cascading from his body. He runs a hand through his damp hair, then picks up the bottle of champagne and his glass.</p><p>\u201cShall we move to the sauna?\u201d he asks, steam rising from the miles of his flawless, pale skin. </p><p>Stung with residual anger and humiliation, Dan just nods tightly, and manages to manoeuvre himself, with a fair bit of difficulty, up the steps. Phil follows after, lithe with grace and poise, but he doesn\u2019t attempt to overtake Dan as he makes his way across the short distance from the tub to the glass door of the sauna. </p><p>He does, however, dart his arm out to neatly pull the door open before Dan can reach out for it. He holds the door, allowing Dan to limp through, which is infuriatingly chivalrous of him, and Dan has a mind to tell him as much. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a damsel in distress,\u201d he says, collapsing on the nearest wooden bench. Immediately, the moisture in his mouth dries up; this small room is ridiculously arid. He comes in once a day to clean it, but there are only four benches, stacked on two levels, so it never takes long. He\u2019s never been good with heat, which is why he chose to disappear into the tundra rather than, say, the Indian Desert. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold doors for me and bring me ice packs or whatever.\u201d </p><p>Phil hands him his glass, which he must have scooped from the edge of the tub on his way. Dan scowls, but takes it anyway, and Phil pours some more champagne into it, then his own. </p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re sensitive,\u201d Phil says, slumping down onto the adjacent bench. \u201cI embarrassed you, huh?\u201d </p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cI just can\u2019t, like, understand you. You make me feel on edge.\u201d Phil raises an eyebrow, sipping his drink. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I bloody fancy you though, jeez. You\u2019re married. And a dick-brain.\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs. \u201cDick-brain?\u201d </p><p>Dan lowers his glass, displeased with himself for letting that one slip. \u201cProb\u2019ly shouldn\u2019t have said that out loud. Sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you think I\u2019m a dick-brain, but you just haven\u2019t said it out loud until now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d Dan shifts in his too-hot seat; the backs of his thighs are sticking to the wood. He turns to the burning coals in the corner, wondering if throwing himself upon them would be too dramatic. </p><p>\u201cLook, would it help if I divulged some personal crap too? Might help you to relax,\u201d Phil suggests. </p><p>\u201cAm I not normally relaxed?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, then leans back against the wall. \u201cNah, you\u2019re kind of\u2026\u201d he flaps his hand in the air. \u201cSkittish.\u201d </p><p>Hearing this description of himself is startling. He\u2019s never considered that other people might see his anxiety leaking out so obviously. Is Phil just a perceptive person, or is it plain as day that Dan is near constantly on edge, always worrying, never truly feeling he can let things go? </p><p>He forces himself to mimic Phil\u2019s stance, shoulders slumped, legs slightly apart, head lolling back against the wall behind him. \u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says after a while, in what he hopes is a nonchalant voice. \u201cTell me about your husband.\u201d </p><p>He can feel Phil\u2019s narrow-eyed stare, but Dan focuses resolutely on his glass of champagne, heart pounding because he\u2019s never said something so bold in his life. </p><p>\u201cAre you a reporter?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, of course not. Who the hell would I be reporting to up here?\u201d </p><p>This seems to placate Phil, though he still looks unhappy with the turn in conversation. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows nervously, scratching at his bare thigh where the droplets of pool water are trickling and evaporating. \u201cHow did it happen? Like\u2026 you met him at uni right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn the library,\u201d Phil confirms. There\u2019s a silence then, but Dan forces himself not to jump in and fill it, so that Phil will continue. It works. He sighs, shifting to slip a little further down the wall. \u201cI\u2019d heard gossip that some heir to Royalty was strutting about campus pretending to learn something. I didn\u2019t give it much thought, honestly.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s interest is now fully piqued. He tries not to look too keen for the next part of the story. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like him?\u201d </p><p>One of Phil\u2019s shoulders shrugs. \u201cMore like I just didn\u2019t care. I knew vaguely who he was from the news and stuff, but it just didn\u2019t seem anything to do with me. I liked my course, I liked my friends, I was doing well. I just didn\u2019t have time to obsess over some rich kid the way everyone else was.\u201d </p><p>This is all sounding disturbingly familiar. \u201cSo what changed?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was in the library one day, working,\u201d Phil replies in a quieter voice. His eyes slowly defocus, staring at the empty, gelatinous air hanging in the middle of the room. \u201cHe just came and sat next to me. He had an entourage of giggling first years lingering around him, sat at the next table over. Actually, it was annoying. I was trying to work. But he didn\u2019t disrupt me. He just sat there reading something, and I kept, like, <i>feeling</i> him look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn entourage?\u201d Dan asks, finding this hard to believe. \u201cSurely he\u2019s not that attractive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil fixes him with a curious stare. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what he looks like?\u201d </p><p>Dan tries to scrounge up Sir Nikolai\u2019s face in his mind. All that comes up is a blank, white face with generic features. He couldn\u2019t even say for sure what colour hair the guy has. He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t really read, like, celeb news.\u201d </p><p>For a fleeting second, something akin to respect passes across Phil\u2019s features, but it\u2019s gone so quickly Dan can\u2019t be sure if it was a heat-born mirage. \u201cWell, yeah. He\u2019s hot. Objectively speaking. Ask pretty much anyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says. For some reason, this makes him feel strangely irritated, like he wishes Phil would tack on to this statement that Nikolai is also vain or pretentious. \u201cSo, what, you got into a heated discussion about <i>Sartre</i> in the library caf\u00e9 and fell into his arms?\u201d </p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth quirks. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d He sips some champagne. \u201cHe asked me for a pen or something, I don\u2019t remember. It was just an excuse to talk to me, I think. He told me afterwards that he wasn\u2019t even reading the book he had with him. In retrospect, I reckon he probably came into the library to find someone sitting alone, that he could-\u201d Phil cuts himself off abruptly. He takes a larger gulp of champagne. \u201cAnyway. I was young, and he was gorgeous, and pretty intimidating. He asked me to go on a date with him, and I didn\u2019t wanna be the guy who said no to a date with the world\u2019s hottest, most eligible bachelor.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, chewing this over. He\u2019s desperate to probe further into whatever Phil had thought better about saying, but he\u2019s already teetering on the edge of his seat, sure that Phil is about to realise he\u2019s spewing too much. This is the kind of behind-the-scenes gold that maybe only a handful of people have heard. If he were the sort of person that sold gossip to tabloids, he\u2019d probably make a load of cash for this.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dan says as casually as he can. \u201cDid he intimidate you into marrying him, as well?\u201d </p><p>Phil snorts with laughter. \u201cOuch.\u201d </p><p>A sharp thrill runs through Dan, chased immediately by a pang of guilt. \u201cSorry. I just don\u2019t get it. Sure, he\u2019s rich, and apparently attractive, but marrying someone is\u2026 y\u2019know. Mad. You met him in <i>uni.</i>\u00a0And committed to be with him for the rest of your life.\u201d </p><p>A faint, amused smile graces Phil\u2019s lips. \u201cGuess where he took me on our first date?\u201d </p><p>Dan shrugs, not giving much thought to the unexpected question. \u201cDinner at some extravagant restaurant?\u201d </p><p>\u201cParis.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do for the second date?\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs. \u201cHe rented out a cinema and screened <i>Kill Bill</i>, which was my favourite film at the time. And he hired a Michelin star chef to provide us with cocktails and gourmet popcorn.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan shakes his head, marvelling. \u201cThat\u2019s insane. I\u2019ve never even <i>smelled</i> the amount of money he must have spent on that.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, musing. \u201cKind of a waste, too. We didn\u2019t watch much of the film, as far as I remember.\u201d </p><p>The temperature seems to rise a good few degrees; Dan is sure he\u2019s beginning to resemble a boiled sweet. \u201cI guess it must be pretty nice to have someone do all that for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, though,\u201d Phil replies, smile slipping. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. That much money is all smoke and mirrors. I was so young. I grew up in a working class family, took out a loan to go to uni like everyone else. I\u2019d never touched wealth like that. It was overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Dan considers this, letting Phil\u2019s words fold slowly into his champagne-gauzed mind. He hadn\u2019t been aware of Phil\u2019s background until now; he\u2019d just assumed he\u2019d grown up rich. It\u2019s bizarre to think that once, the two of them were probably quite similar. They might even have been friends before Nikolai swooped Phil off to a life of luxury. </p><p>\u201cI thought I was in love,\u201d Phil says, maybe to himself. He lifts the bottle of champagne, and refills his glass, then leans over to pour some into Dan\u2019s. \u201cBut it was infatuation. It\u2019s hard to discern if something\u2019s real when it\u2019s dripping in diamonds.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dan chews his lip, wondering whether this is a step too far. In the end, the champagne decides to push the question out regardless. \u201cYou don\u2019t love him?\u201d</p><p>If Phil is annoyed by the intrusive question, he doesn\u2019t show it. He just shakes his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me either. So I don\u2019t feel too bad.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Dan says quietly. \u201cHe must have wanted you. He asked you to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wanted a story,\u201d Phil says, dejectedly. \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with fame. With being this renegade-Royal, upsetting his father and behaving obscenely. He announced that he was bi, but nobody cared. So he one-upped himself. Found the nearest nobody and seduced him with cash and grand gestures. You should\u2019ve seen the ring he gave me when he asked.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes fall to the ring on Phil\u2019s finger now. It\u2019s silver, and shiny, but simple, demure. Phil follows Dan\u2019s gaze. \u201cThis isn\u2019t it. The engagement ring is in a safe somewhere now. He let me choose something a bit less extravagant for the wedding, thank God.\u201d</p><p>The words\u00a0\u2018let me\u2019 leap out at Dan, making him frown.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine being married right now,\u201d Dan confesses. \u201cYou were my age, right?\u201d </p><p>So, <i>perhaps</i> Dan\u2019s done a little digging in his down time.\u00a0</p><p>Phil squints at him. \u201cI was twenty-one when we got married.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYounger than me, then. Is it weird?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m drowning in marital bliss, let\u2019s put it that way. His press agent sees him more than I do.\u201d </p><p>From the way Phil describes him, along with the vague bits and pieces Dan\u2019s gleaned from news articles over the years, he strongly suspects that Sir Nikolai is an even worse version of Phil himself. Arrogant, snobby, unfeeling. Why anyone would want to be associated with such a man, let alone be married to him, is entirely baffling. Then again, Dan supposes that Phil was absurdly young to have been expected to work this out. He\u2019d confused Sir Nikolai\u2019s grand, extravagant gestures for actual affection, as any ordinary twenty-one-year-old undoubtedly would. In the eyes of someone so naive to the perils of dating, Sir Nikolai probably seemed like some fairytale prince, rescuing Phil from a life of mundanity. Despite Dan\u2019s twenty-first year being spent firmly in the closet, with a girlfriend, he\u2019s not sure he would have been able to resist Sir Nikolai himself, back then. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to stay up here?\u201d Dan asks, still thinking. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you go and be with him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA good question,\u201d Phil says with a snort. \u201cI ask him that every time we speak. It\u2019s always something vague. The paparazzi are out for my blood. News of the two of us sighted together would overshadow whatever project he\u2019s currently working on. I\u2019d be bored to pieces trailing around after him. It\u2019s all bollocks. It\u2019s just easier for him if I\u2019m kept far away, only brought out when I need to be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 why here?\u201d Dan asks, gesturing to the door of the sauna, outside of which the mountain lies, stunning and ferocious. \u201cSurely he has mansions or castles he could stow you in?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cSure. Loads. It wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference, though. A cage is still a cage, no matter how shiny the bars. Initially he sold this place to me as a suite in a remote, exotic mountain retreat, available to me for as long as I liked. He told me the staff would wait on me hand and foot, that I could ski, totally undisturbed, and that I could stay there indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cWhen you put it like that, it sounds amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. He didn\u2019t mention that leaving was basically not allowed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot allowed,\u201d Dan repeats, not bothering to hide his disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling. That\u2019s how he treats his <i>husband</i>. Like you\u2019re a pet or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rich-kid mentality,\u201d Phil says, nodding. \u201cAlways greedy for the next shiny toy. He\u2019d stop at nothing to get me, but once he got me, he was bored. Locked me away in the toy box.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo just divorce him,\u201d Dan blurts. </p><p>In the next mortified second, Dan tries in vain to summon the Gods to turn back time. This champagne is unscrewing his inhibitions in a dangerous way. Phil, thankfully, just seems amused by his sudden boldness.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as that,\u201d he replies with gentle condescension. \u201cHe\u2019s got an army of lawyers that would fight tooth and nail to keep a messy divorce from happening. His reputation would suffer if anyone caught wind that I wasn\u2019t totally besotted with the darling of the Swiss monarchy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019d buy you off or something, to keep you quiet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMore likely they\u2019d just threaten to leave me with nothing,\u201d Phil says with a resigned sigh, suggesting he\u2019s thought about this a lot. \u201cCan you imagine if I tried to go up in a legal battle against someone that powerful? I come from nothing. I never even finished my degree. All my money comes from him. I don\u2019t have a place to live, no job, nothing. He owns me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck <i>that</i>.\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs, louder and fuller than Dan has heard since earlier at the bottom of the slope, what seems like a lifetime ago. The sauna is tilting gently from side to side, like it\u2019s bobbing on a calm sea. It\u2019s quite pleasant, like being rocked in a large, very warm cradle. To further this concept, Dan decides to lie down on the bench, staring up at the wooden ceiling. </p><p>\u201cNobody owns you, Phil,\u201d he\u2019s suddenly saying. \u201cYou can go back and finish your degree if you want. You\u2019re young. Too young to be stuck up here all alone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cInteresting that you don\u2019t seem to be taking your own advice,\u201d Phil points out.\u00a0</p><p>Dan tilts his head back, seeing Phil upside-down. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Phil sips more champagne, his amusement stretching across his upside-down mouth. </p><p>\u201c\u2018cause like\u2026\u201d Dan\u2019s mind swims; he can\u2019t remember his own arguments. Did he ever even have any? \u201cOkay, okay, fine. You\u2019re right. We\u2019re both hiding up here \u2018cause we can\u2019t face how scary reality is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Phil agrees. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought we\u2019d find common ground?\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, then sits up and drains the last of his glass. \u201cWouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I\u2019m still a dick-brain, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Dan hiccups. \u201cSorry, mate. Your husband\u2019s shit, but there\u2019s no excuse for rudeness.\u201d </p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cEven though I said sorry?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still rude to me!\u201d </p><p>Dan sets his glass down, then nearly knocks it off the bench as he attempts to get comfortable. Luckily, Phil swoops in and grabs it just in time. He\u2019s smiling, tickled by Dan\u2019s clumsiness. \u201cI used to be nice, you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight, sure. Before fame changed you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBefore I grew into a bitter old housewife thirty years too soon.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s smile wanes. There\u2019s a soft tugging in the vicinity of his heart. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. He can\u2019t seem to look away. \u201cYour eyes are crazy blue,\u201d he finds himself saying.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\u2019s awkward, answering cough should embarrass him, but it doesn\u2019t. \u201cI think we should probably call it a night, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p><p>Dan frowns. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not that late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten-thirty.\u201d </p><p>No, it can\u2019t possibly be. Phil peels his Apple Watch from his wrist and holds it out for Dan to see. \u201cChrist,\u201d Dan says, starting to gather up his towel - which has somehow slipped off somewhere in the midst of the alcohol induced chat. \u201cI should- I\u2019ve got to-\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s getting to his feet, mind already projecting ahead to the million tasks he needs to complete before he can call it a night. For fuck\u2019s sake, he\u2019s somehow spent the whole day slacking off on the slopes and in the hot tub. He\u2019s so lost in his own stupidity that he forgets to ease the weight on his ankle, and cries out as the pain lances through him. He topples to one side, and is immediately caught by two very warm, damp arms. </p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Phil says, like he always does.</p><p>Dan turns to look at him. His expression leaks his own shock that he jumped up to catch Dan at all. Slowly, Dan extricates himself, heart suddenly a kick drum reverberating through the cavity of his chest. </p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0</p><p>In silence, the two of them gather the bottle and glasses, then shuffle to the door. Phil ducks around Dan, who is slow from his limp, and reaches for the door. He shoves it. It doesn\u2019t move. He shoves it again. Nothing. </p><p>Phil turns to Dan, frowning. \u201cWon\u2019t open.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d Dan replies, heart sinking. </p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d Phil says with a shrug. </p><p>Dan reaches out, shoving at the door. It doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cShit,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cAre we locked in?\u201d </p><p>They\u2019ll dehydrate in less than twenty-four hours. Even quicker from the bottle of champagne they\u2019ve downed between them. He turns to Phil, eyes wide. </p><p>\u201cDid you not bring the key?\u201d Phil asks, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cKey?\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cI\u2019ve never known about- this is your bloody fault! I\u2019ve never even been in this sauna, you should have known we needed a key-\u201d</p><p>Dan cuts off. Phil is fighting a smile, lips pressed together. For whatever reason, Dan is pretty sure that he\u2019s about to commit a murder in the next few seconds. He takes a deep breath, and watches with rising levels of pure homicidal rage as Phil pulls on the door handle, and it glides open. </p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t resist,\u201d Phil says, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re too easy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI fucking hate you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I hate you, you hate me. Let\u2019s try and get you across the snow without you breaking your neck.\u201d </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183478354475/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eight!</a>)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br></b><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a></b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Chapter Seven</b></p><p>The minute Dan\u2019s skis are pried off, he limps across the lobby to the reception desk, and flops down into the seat, groaning. \u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re expecting an apology for \u2018forcing\u2019 you to come skiing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Dan says, suppressing an eye roll. \u201cIt was my own stupid fault, I know that. Should\u2019ve listened about the bloody skins.\u201d </p><p>As if this has reminded him, Phil turns back to where they\u2019ve rested their skis against the wall, and begins peeling off the skins from the undersides. \u201cHow\u2019s the ankle feeling now?\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cLike it\u2019s caught in a steel vice, and someone\u2019s slowly grinding the crank,\u201d Dan replies, lifting his foot onto his knee so he can examine it for himself. </p><p>\u201cWere you a drama kid at school, by any chance?\u201d </p><p>Dan shoots a glare towards Phil, but it only glances off his back as he makes his way to the stairs. \u201cSee you later, then,\u201d Dan mutters.</p><p>Phil pauses for a fraction of a second, then continues on his way without turning round. For a few minutes, Dan prods and turns his ankle experimentally, testing the limits of his flexibility. If he\u2019s unable to get up and down those stairs, he\u2019s in huge trouble. He\u2019s so focused on the ankle that he doesn\u2019t notice Phil reappearing until the bottom stair creaks. In his hand he\u2019s got an ice pack, which he hands to Dan across the desk, wordlessly. </p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce it for twenty minutes or so,\u201d Phil instructs. \u201cShould help with the swelling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Dan mutters, hardly listening as he wraps the long pack around the injured area. </p><p>\u201cThen I think we should go in the hot tub.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, ok- woah, what?\u201d </p><p>Phil now has both forearms on the lip of the desk; there\u2019s that hint of a hidden smile tucked beneath his expression. \u201cSoaking it for a while would help with the pain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you need to accompany me because\u2026?\u201d </p><p>Like a ray of sunlight through thick storm clouds, Phil\u2019s smile breaks through. He leans up, rolling his shoulders. \u201cI just heaved your bony body a mile across mountain. My muscles could use a soak too.\u201d </p><p>Chastened, Dan shrinks into his seat. \u201cRight. Of course, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWorried I\u2019m going to ogle you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cN-no! I just\u2026 I dunno, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even supposed to go in the hot tub. I\u2019m not a guest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell,\u201d Phil says, then actually <i>winks.</i> He stretches his arms behind his back then, chest puffing out, and says, \u201cright, I\u2019m gonna grab a drink and change. Meet you out there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, I should get that for you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, you\u2019re literally hobbled. I can handle getting a drink out of the kitchen fridge.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, grateful for this small allowance. \u201cRight. Um, fine then. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll meet you out there.\u201d </p><p>Phil leaves, heading once more for the stairs, and Dan watches him intently, stomach freely somersaulting as he tries to imagine how the next few hours of his life will go, sat in a hot tub with Phil Novokoric. What will they talk about? The weather? There\u2019s only so much to say when it\u2019s perpetually freezing. What have they even been talking about all day so far? Dan doesn\u2019t remember many\u00a0 awkward silences, but he does remember a lingering feeling of frustration beneath every word they spoke to one another. </p><p>The throbbing in his ankle has been blurring Dan\u2019s thoughts into a mess of confusion, particularly on the journey back, but now that the ice pack has begun numbing the pain, all Dan can remember is the sensation of being tucked so tightly against Phil\u2019s side. For a long time, they\u2019d been closely pressed together, and Phil hadn\u2019t so much as complained. Well, he\u2019d said that Dan was \u2018bony\u2019, but it sounded more like an excuse to speak than a real objection. </p><p>For several minutes, Dan replays the long walk back he and Phil shared, trying to remember everything he\u2019d said, and whether he should be embarrassed or regretful. It\u2019s only when he glances at the clock on the wall that he realises time is ticking by, and he\u2019s still fully dressed right down to his coat. With a panicked look towards the mezzanine, he removes the ice pack and stands carefully, managing to limp his way to the side of the room, where the stock cupboard is, tucked out of sight behind a hidden door in the wood-panelled wall. </p><p>In here, he finds a fresh robe, a pair of white swim trunks, and some of the hotel branded slippers. Mona ensures that all of these items are available to guests that might have overlooked packing certain essentials. It\u2019s surprising how often they\u2019re asked for spare swimwear that guests have forgotten in a haste to make their plane. Dan didn\u2019t bring any swim trunks with him because he\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d need them up here, so spares it is. He carries the garments into Mona\u2019s office, peeling off his many layers\u00a0 and slipping on the trunks. </p><p>He already feels alarmingly naked, so dons the slippers and robe, tying it tightly. Before he leaves the office, he catches sight of himself in Mona\u2019s small, square mirror tacked to the wall. His hair is wild, mussed up by the hat he\u2019d been wearing, so he runs a hand through it, though it makes virtually no difference. His lips seem fuller, pinkened by the icy chill, and his cheeks have a flush to them that won\u2019t seem to go away. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s his rosacea, this time. </p><p>Turning from his reflection abruptly, Dan focuses on making his way out of the office, then through the lobby to the back door without injuring himself further. Through a technique Dan decides is called \u2018furniture balancing\u2019 he manages to get himself to the back door without putting much weight on his right foot. </p><p>When he gets outside, Phil is already in the jacuzzi. It\u2019s an in-ground tub, hexagonal in shape, with wooden skirting that Dan has to go over with a large broom and sweep the snow off every morning. There\u2019s a bottle of champagne sat on this skirting, and two glasses beside Phil\u2019s elbow, which rests out of the water. </p><p>He turns to Dan, hearing his slow, limping approach. \u201cThought you\u2019d chickened out,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d Dan says, teeth already chattering. </p><p>Why had he not thought about the fact he\u2019s got virtually no clothes on before now? He wraps his robe tighter around himself. The hairs on his legs are totally erect and he feels like the moisture in his eyes is freezing over. </p><p>\u201cHence the hot tub,\u201d Phil says, snorting. </p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, but edges closer, hands tucked into his armpits. Crap, Phil is\u2026 very naked. He has swim trunks on obviously, a deep red blur beneath the water, but Dan can see every hair brushed across his broad chest. He can see the soft bulges of his arm muscles, and collarbones and shoulder blades and long, pale legs. Dan doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s staring until Phil meets his eyes. </p><p>\u201cAre you doing some delayed satisfaction kink-thing? Get in before you contract hypothermia.\u201d </p><p>Blushing mostly at hearing Phil say \u2018kink\u2019 which seems somehow unsavoury and titillating at once, Dan says nothing, but tugs at the knot of his robe. He turns away as he removes it, and throws it over the handlebar of the steps, on top of Phil\u2019s. He shucks off his slippers, wriggles his bruised ankle experimentally - the purpling colour looks far worse now - and then carefully plunges it into the water. </p><p>Instantly, relief overwhelms him, which is annoying, because it means Phil was right. He can\u2019t help the sigh of relief that escapes him even so, blissed out as the throbbing pain recedes, chased off by the pins-and-needles heat of the hot water. So as not to put any weight on the injured ankle, Dan sits down on the top step, and lowers himself in that way. When he\u2019s submerged to his waist, he looks up and finds Phil watching him amusedly. </p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe scalding-heat-freezing-cold combo is a nice distraction from the agony, yes.\u201d </p><p>Phil titters, turning back to the view of the mountains in front of them. He picks up the bottle from behind him, and Dan can see the muscles in his back twisting and sliding. He has to force himself not to stare; it\u2019s not because of any sexual desire of course, just that Dan\u2019s so unused to seeing real muscle definition, honed by actual effort put in from exercise. When he turns back, Dan\u2019s eyes fall to the bottle, and he balks. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that like a five-hundred-euro bottle of champagne?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Phil says, peeling off the foil. \u201cMy <i>hubby</i> can cover it.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s no mistaking the acidity in his tone. Dan hasn\u2019t needed it spelled out for him so far, Phil\u2019s reluctance and soured face whenever he mentions the name is enough to glean that the subject of Sir Nikolai Novokoric is off-limits. Dan clamps his mouth shut obediently, watching as Phil pops the cork, and pours some into one of the glasses, then takes the other, and pours some into that too. </p><p>He hands one to Dan, who takes it, baffled. \u201cWait, this is for me?\u201d </p><p>Phil gives him a strange look. \u201cDid you think I brought two glasses out here for myself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, well it\u2019s kind of you but, um,\u201d Dan falters, distracted by the cool drips of condensation forming on the outside of the glass. As he inhales, the sparkle of the champagne fizzes on his tongue, mingled with the chlorine steam. \u201cI-I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m technically working.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yes, I forgot you\u2019ve got to stay alert for all the many guests that might need your assistance.\u201d</p><p>Conflicted, Dan watches Phil tip some of the cool, bubbling liquid into his mouth. His prominent Adams apple bobs, and immediately all Dan can think is that he needs to be not-sober. He takes a sip. </p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s divine,\u201d Dan mutters, remembering as it slips down his throat that this champagne costs more than he has had in his bank account for some time. \u201cRemind me to put this on your tab or Mona will freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can pay you for it right now in cash, if it\u2019s easier,\u201d Phil replies smoothly. </p><p>\u201cHow the other half live,\u201d Dan can\u2019t stop himself saying back. </p><p>Phil shoots him a narrow-eyed look that Dan avoids by sipping more champagne. \u201cIt\u2019s not my money.\u201d </p><p>With a great deal of effort, Dan manages not to respond to this ludicrous statement. If you marry someone, what\u2019s theirs is yours. That\u2019s just how it works. For a while, they stew in the painfully awkward silence this money-talk has churned up, sipping from their glasses and pretending to be engrossed in the view. Eventually, Phil shifts across his seat and reaches to a control pad, turning the jets on. The noise of the frothing, bubbling water obliterates the silence in a way that should be unsettling, but actually has Dan melting in relief.\u00a0</p><p>Over the cacophony, Phil shouts, \u201cso, what\u2019s your story then?\u201d</p><p>Dan looks at him, surprised. \u201cMy story?\u201d he asks, voice raised.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn my experience, people don\u2019t tend to take jobs high up in the mountains on their own on a whim,\u201d he says loudly. </p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Dan shouts, prickling with annoyance, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>This admission seems to give Phil enough reason to pause. For a moment, Dan doesn\u2019t elaborate, relishing the look of surprise and intrigue on Phil\u2019s face. He sips his drink, quietly basking in the cloak of enigma he\u2019s draped around himself. Inevitably however, he can\u2019t stand the silence stretching. He doesn\u2019t particularly want to divulge details about his hideous life to someone he can barely stand, but the champagne is already loosening his tongue, and here, dwarfed by the enormous peaks ahead of them, his old existence and all its many aspects that once seemed so intolerable now seem\u2026 wholly insignificant.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just looked around one day and realised\u2026 there\u2019s not a single thing about my life that I truly enjoy,\u201d Dan says, words spilling from his mouth like they\u2019ve been gathered there for days, waiting for a chance to emerge. Bubbles tickle the back of his throat as he swallows another mouthful of delicious champagne. \u201cSo, I dropped it all. Hurled out a load of applications to customer service jobs in different places. I\u2019ve worked in retail and waiting jobs part-time for years, so I knew I\u2019d have no trouble landing one. Mona emailed me asking if I\u2019d be up for something\u2026 remote, and I knew it was the dumbest thing I could possibly do. So I said yes.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd here you are,\u201d Phil murmurs. </p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>\u201cSo what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat was it that wasn\u2019t making you happy? Hated your boss? No one swiping right on your Tinder profile?\u201d </p><p>Dan thinks about asking him exactly why it\u2019s any of his damn business, but again that sense of his old life\u2019s unimportance washes over him. It laps at his skin like the water he\u2019s submerged in, reminding him of how small they are, how similarly ignored by the universe because of their size, their position on the planet. What does it even matter if he tells this man everything? He\u2019s only asking to fill the time the two of them have got to kill whilst they\u2019re alone up here. It\u2019s not like Dan\u2019s dull, mediocre story will mean anything to someone like Phil Novokoric; who would he bother to tell? Dan sinks a bit further down, so his shoulders are underwater, and tilts his head back to look into the sky. </p><p>\u201cI was at university, studying law,\u201d Dan says, mouth twisting into a frown as he remembers the endless thick piles of reading, the leather briefcase his Dad had bought for him to look \u2018professional\u2019. \u201cI only chose it because my Dad told me it was a solid career path. I had a girlfriend. Met her at a party in the first week I was there. Honestly, I don\u2019t think she even liked me that much. She just knew I was on track to be a lawyer, she found me attractive enough I guess, and that was enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love her?\u201d </p><p>Dan hesitates, the question seeming alien. He\u2019s never actually thought about it before, he realises with a start. He wonders why Phil even wants to know such a strange, intimate detail. \u201cNot in the way I should have,\u201d he answers carefully. He pauses, wondering if he\u2019s really about to say the next bit when he\u2019s never been able to admit it aloud to anyone. Somehow, up here in the atmosphere, buoyed by alcohol and thin, oxygen-starved air, it just doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal. \u201cTurns out she\u2019s not really\u2026 my type.\u201d </p><p>The jets, on a two-minute timer, suddenly cease bubbling. The silence that follows, punctuated only by the slight swilling of water, is excruciating. The weight of his sort-of-admission seems to drag him deeper into the water; why had he said anything at all? Why had he just ripped off his shroud of anonymity for this sneery, snobbish stranger? Before Dan can explode into a full-blown panic attack, Phil chuckles. Dan sits up straight, staring at him in dismay.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming out to me?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>Dan splutters, reddening rapidly. \u201cAre you <i>laughing</i> at me coming out to you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Phil says, though he\u2019s <i>still</i> laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA little what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell. You\u2019re not exactly subtle. I can tell you fancy me.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201c<i>What</i>?!\u201d </p><p>In response, Phil just holds Dan\u2019s gaze as he downs the remains of his glass. </p><p>\u201cThat is- I absolutely do <i>not</i>-\u201d Dan is so red that he feels like a slowly boiling lobster. Too outraged to trust himself to respond properly, Dan puts down his glass and splashily shimmies over to the steps, hauling himself out. \u201cGod, you are unbelievable!\u201d he shouts as he goes. \u201cEvery time I think you might show a shade of decency, you just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil calls, a bubble of laughter in his voice. </p><p>Dan pauses, mostly because he\u2019s finding it pretty difficult to make it up the steps in his crippled state. He turns, shivering with cold and fury, back to the man. Phil is staring at him with a combination of pity and amusement, which is an unusual thing to be able to recognise, though Dan is quickly learning that Phil\u2019s face is deceptively expressive, but only when he deigns to actually show emotion. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking.\u201d</p><p>The tension leaks, treacly and slow, from Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Before Dan can beg the universe to create a whirlpool in this small hot tub and drown them both, Phil stands, water cascading from his body. He runs a hand through his damp hair, then picks up the bottle of champagne and his glass.</p><p>\u201cShall we move to the sauna?\u201d he asks, steam rising from the miles of his flawless, pale skin. </p><p>Stung with residual anger and humiliation, Dan just nods tightly, and manages to manoeuvre himself, with a fair bit of difficulty, up the steps. Phil follows after, lithe with grace and poise, but he doesn\u2019t attempt to overtake Dan as he makes his way across the short distance from the tub to the glass door of the sauna. </p><p>He does, however, dart his arm out to neatly pull the door open before Dan can reach out for it. He holds the door, allowing Dan to limp through, which is infuriatingly chivalrous of him, and Dan has a mind to tell him as much. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a damsel in distress,\u201d he says, collapsing on the nearest wooden bench. Immediately, the moisture in his mouth dries up; this small room is ridiculously arid. He comes in once a day to clean it, but there are only four benches, stacked on two levels, so it never takes long. He\u2019s never been good with heat, which is why he chose to disappear into the tundra rather than, say, the Indian Desert. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold doors for me and bring me ice packs or whatever.\u201d </p><p>Phil hands him his glass, which he must have scooped from the edge of the tub on his way. Dan scowls, but takes it anyway, and Phil pours some more champagne into it, then his own. </p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re sensitive,\u201d Phil says, slumping down onto the adjacent bench. \u201cI embarrassed you, huh?\u201d </p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cI just can\u2019t, like, understand you. You make me feel on edge.\u201d Phil raises an eyebrow, sipping his drink. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I bloody fancy you though, jeez. You\u2019re married. And a dick-brain.\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs. \u201cDick-brain?\u201d </p><p>Dan lowers his glass, displeased with himself for letting that one slip. \u201cProb\u2019ly shouldn\u2019t have said that out loud. Sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you think I\u2019m a dick-brain, but you just haven\u2019t said it out loud until now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d Dan shifts in his too-hot seat; the backs of his thighs are sticking to the wood. He turns to the burning coals in the corner, wondering if throwing himself upon them would be too dramatic. </p><p>\u201cLook, would it help if I divulged some personal crap too? Might help you to relax,\u201d Phil suggests. </p><p>\u201cAm I not normally relaxed?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, then leans back against the wall. \u201cNah, you\u2019re kind of\u2026\u201d he flaps his hand in the air. \u201cSkittish.\u201d </p><p>Hearing this description of himself is startling. He\u2019s never considered that other people might see his anxiety leaking out so obviously. Is Phil just a perceptive person, or is it plain as day that Dan is near constantly on edge, always worrying, never truly feeling he can let things go? </p><p>He forces himself to mimic Phil\u2019s stance, shoulders slumped, legs slightly apart, head lolling back against the wall behind him. \u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says after a while, in what he hopes is a nonchalant voice. \u201cTell me about your husband.\u201d </p><p>He can feel Phil\u2019s narrow-eyed stare, but Dan focuses resolutely on his glass of champagne, heart pounding because he\u2019s never said something so bold in his life. </p><p>\u201cAre you a reporter?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, of course not. Who the hell would I be reporting to up here?\u201d </p><p>This seems to placate Phil, though he still looks unhappy with the turn in conversation. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows nervously, scratching at his bare thigh where the droplets of pool water are trickling and evaporating. \u201cHow did it happen? Like\u2026 you met him at uni right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn the library,\u201d Phil confirms. There\u2019s a silence then, but Dan forces himself not to jump in and fill it, so that Phil will continue. It works. He sighs, shifting to slip a little further down the wall. \u201cI\u2019d heard gossip that some heir to Royalty was strutting about campus pretending to learn something. I didn\u2019t give it much thought, honestly.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s interest is now fully piqued. He tries not to look too keen for the next part of the story. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like him?\u201d </p><p>One of Phil\u2019s shoulders shrugs. \u201cMore like I just didn\u2019t care. I knew vaguely who he was from the news and stuff, but it just didn\u2019t seem anything to do with me. I liked my course, I liked my friends, I was doing well. I just didn\u2019t have time to obsess over some rich kid the way everyone else was.\u201d </p><p>This is all sounding disturbingly familiar. \u201cSo what changed?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was in the library one day, working,\u201d Phil replies in a quieter voice. His eyes slowly defocus, staring at the empty, gelatinous air hanging in the middle of the room. \u201cHe just came and sat next to me. He had an entourage of giggling first years lingering around him, sat at the next table over. Actually, it was annoying. I was trying to work. But he didn\u2019t disrupt me. He just sat there reading something, and I kept, like, <i>feeling</i> him look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn entourage?\u201d Dan asks, finding this hard to believe. \u201cSurely he\u2019s not that attractive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil fixes him with a curious stare. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what he looks like?\u201d </p><p>Dan tries to scrounge up Sir Nikolai\u2019s face in his mind. All that comes up is a blank, white face with generic features. He couldn\u2019t even say for sure what colour hair the guy has. He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t really read, like, celeb news.\u201d </p><p>For a fleeting second, something akin to respect passes across Phil\u2019s features, but it\u2019s gone so quickly Dan can\u2019t be sure if it was a heat-born mirage. \u201cWell, yeah. He\u2019s hot. Objectively speaking. Ask pretty much anyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says. For some reason, this makes him feel strangely irritated, like he wishes Phil would tack on to this statement that Nikolai is also vain or pretentious. \u201cSo, what, you got into a heated discussion about <i>Sartre</i> in the library caf\u00e9 and fell into his arms?\u201d </p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth quirks. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d He sips some champagne. \u201cHe asked me for a pen or something, I don\u2019t remember. It was just an excuse to talk to me, I think. He told me afterwards that he wasn\u2019t even reading the book he had with him. In retrospect, I reckon he probably came into the library to find someone sitting alone, that he could-\u201d Phil cuts himself off abruptly. He takes a larger gulp of champagne. \u201cAnyway. I was young, and he was gorgeous, and pretty intimidating. He asked me to go on a date with him, and I didn\u2019t wanna be the guy who said no to a date with the world\u2019s hottest, most eligible bachelor.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, chewing this over. He\u2019s desperate to probe further into whatever Phil had thought better about saying, but he\u2019s already teetering on the edge of his seat, sure that Phil is about to realise he\u2019s spewing too much. This is the kind of behind-the-scenes gold that maybe only a handful of people have heard. If he were the sort of person that sold gossip to tabloids, he\u2019d probably make a load of cash for this.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dan says as casually as he can. \u201cDid he intimidate you into marrying him, as well?\u201d </p><p>Phil snorts with laughter. \u201cOuch.\u201d </p><p>A sharp thrill runs through Dan, chased immediately by a pang of guilt. \u201cSorry. I just don\u2019t get it. Sure, he\u2019s rich, and apparently attractive, but marrying someone is\u2026 y\u2019know. Mad. You met him in <i>uni.</i>\u00a0And committed to be with him for the rest of your life.\u201d </p><p>A faint, amused smile graces Phil\u2019s lips. \u201cGuess where he took me on our first date?\u201d </p><p>Dan shrugs, not giving much thought to the unexpected question. \u201cDinner at some extravagant restaurant?\u201d </p><p>\u201cParis.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do for the second date?\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs. \u201cHe rented out a cinema and screened <i>Kill Bill</i>, which was my favourite film at the time. And he hired a Michelin star chef to provide us with cocktails and gourmet popcorn.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan shakes his head, marvelling. \u201cThat\u2019s insane. I\u2019ve never even <i>smelled</i> the amount of money he must have spent on that.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, musing. \u201cKind of a waste, too. We didn\u2019t watch much of the film, as far as I remember.\u201d </p><p>The temperature seems to rise a good few degrees; Dan is sure he\u2019s beginning to resemble a boiled sweet. \u201cI guess it must be pretty nice to have someone do all that for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, though,\u201d Phil replies, smile slipping. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. That much money is all smoke and mirrors. I was so young. I grew up in a working class family, took out a loan to go to uni like everyone else. I\u2019d never touched wealth like that. It was overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Dan considers this, letting Phil\u2019s words fold slowly into his champagne-gauzed mind. He hadn\u2019t been aware of Phil\u2019s background until now; he\u2019d just assumed he\u2019d grown up rich. It\u2019s bizarre to think that once, the two of them were probably quite similar. They might even have been friends before Nikolai swooped Phil off to a life of luxury. </p><p>\u201cI thought I was in love,\u201d Phil says, maybe to himself. He lifts the bottle of champagne, and refills his glass, then leans over to pour some into Dan\u2019s. \u201cBut it was infatuation. It\u2019s hard to discern if something\u2019s real when it\u2019s dripping in diamonds.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dan chews his lip, wondering whether this is a step too far. In the end, the champagne decides to push the question out regardless. \u201cYou don\u2019t love him?\u201d</p><p>If Phil is annoyed by the intrusive question, he doesn\u2019t show it. He just shakes his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me either. So I don\u2019t feel too bad.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Dan says quietly. \u201cHe must have wanted you. He asked you to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wanted a story,\u201d Phil says, dejectedly. \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with fame. With being this renegade-Royal, upsetting his father and behaving obscenely. He announced that he was bi, but nobody cared. So he one-upped himself. Found the nearest nobody and seduced him with cash and grand gestures. You should\u2019ve seen the ring he gave me when he asked.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes fall to the ring on Phil\u2019s finger now. It\u2019s silver, and shiny, but simple, demure. Phil follows Dan\u2019s gaze. \u201cThis isn\u2019t it. The engagement ring is in a safe somewhere now. He let me choose something a bit less extravagant for the wedding, thank God.\u201d</p><p>The words\u00a0\u2018let me\u2019 leap out at Dan, making him frown.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine being married right now,\u201d Dan confesses. \u201cYou were my age, right?\u201d </p><p>So, <i>perhaps</i> Dan\u2019s done a little digging in his down time.\u00a0</p><p>Phil squints at him. \u201cI was twenty-one when we got married.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYounger than me, then. Is it weird?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m drowning in marital bliss, let\u2019s put it that way. His press agent sees him more than I do.\u201d </p><p>From the way Phil describes him, along with the vague bits and pieces Dan\u2019s gleaned from news articles over the years, he strongly suspects that Sir Nikolai is an even worse version of Phil himself. Arrogant, snobby, unfeeling. Why anyone would want to be associated with such a man, let alone be married to him, is entirely baffling. Then again, Dan supposes that Phil was absurdly young to have been expected to work this out. He\u2019d confused Sir Nikolai\u2019s grand, extravagant gestures for actual affection, as any ordinary twenty-one-year-old undoubtedly would. In the eyes of someone so naive to the perils of dating, Sir Nikolai probably seemed like some fairytale prince, rescuing Phil from a life of mundanity. Despite Dan\u2019s twenty-first year being spent firmly in the closet, with a girlfriend, he\u2019s not sure he would have been able to resist Sir Nikolai himself, back then. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to stay up here?\u201d Dan asks, still thinking. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you go and be with him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA good question,\u201d Phil says with a snort. \u201cI ask him that every time we speak. It\u2019s always something vague. The paparazzi are out for my blood. News of the two of us sighted together would overshadow whatever project he\u2019s currently working on. I\u2019d be bored to pieces trailing around after him. It\u2019s all bollocks. It\u2019s just easier for him if I\u2019m kept far away, only brought out when I need to be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 why here?\u201d Dan asks, gesturing to the door of the sauna, outside of which the mountain lies, stunning and ferocious. \u201cSurely he has mansions or castles he could stow you in?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cSure. Loads. It wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference, though. A cage is still a cage, no matter how shiny the bars. Initially he sold this place to me as a suite in a remote, exotic mountain retreat, available to me for as long as I liked. He told me the staff would wait on me hand and foot, that I could ski, totally undisturbed, and that I could stay there indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cWhen you put it like that, it sounds amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. He didn\u2019t mention that leaving was basically not allowed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot allowed,\u201d Dan repeats, not bothering to hide his disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling. That\u2019s how he treats his <i>husband</i>. Like you\u2019re a pet or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rich-kid mentality,\u201d Phil says, nodding. \u201cAlways greedy for the next shiny toy. He\u2019d stop at nothing to get me, but once he got me, he was bored. Locked me away in the toy box.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo just divorce him,\u201d Dan blurts. </p><p>In the next mortified second, Dan tries in vain to summon the Gods to turn back time. This champagne is unscrewing his inhibitions in a dangerous way. Phil, thankfully, just seems amused by his sudden boldness.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as that,\u201d he replies with gentle condescension. \u201cHe\u2019s got an army of lawyers that would fight tooth and nail to keep a messy divorce from happening. His reputation would suffer if anyone caught wind that I wasn\u2019t totally besotted with the darling of the Swiss monarchy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019d buy you off or something, to keep you quiet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMore likely they\u2019d just threaten to leave me with nothing,\u201d Phil says with a resigned sigh, suggesting he\u2019s thought about this a lot. \u201cCan you imagine if I tried to go up in a legal battle against someone that powerful? I come from nothing. I never even finished my degree. All my money comes from him. I don\u2019t have a place to live, no job, nothing. He owns me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck <i>that</i>.\u201d </p><p>Phil laughs, louder and fuller than Dan has heard since earlier at the bottom of the slope, what seems like a lifetime ago. The sauna is tilting gently from side to side, like it\u2019s bobbing on a calm sea. It\u2019s quite pleasant, like being rocked in a large, very warm cradle. To further this concept, Dan decides to lie down on the bench, staring up at the wooden ceiling. </p><p>\u201cNobody owns you, Phil,\u201d he\u2019s suddenly saying. \u201cYou can go back and finish your degree if you want. You\u2019re young. Too young to be stuck up here all alone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cInteresting that you don\u2019t seem to be taking your own advice,\u201d Phil points out.\u00a0</p><p>Dan tilts his head back, seeing Phil upside-down. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Phil sips more champagne, his amusement stretching across his upside-down mouth. </p><p>\u201c\u2018cause like\u2026\u201d Dan\u2019s mind swims; he can\u2019t remember his own arguments. Did he ever even have any? \u201cOkay, okay, fine. You\u2019re right. We\u2019re both hiding up here \u2018cause we can\u2019t face how scary reality is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Phil agrees. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought we\u2019d find common ground?\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, then sits up and drains the last of his glass. \u201cWouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I\u2019m still a dick-brain, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Dan hiccups. \u201cSorry, mate. Your husband\u2019s shit, but there\u2019s no excuse for rudeness.\u201d </p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cEven though I said sorry?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still rude to me!\u201d </p><p>Dan sets his glass down, then nearly knocks it off the bench as he attempts to get comfortable. Luckily, Phil swoops in and grabs it just in time. He\u2019s smiling, tickled by Dan\u2019s clumsiness. \u201cI used to be nice, you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight, sure. Before fame changed you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBefore I grew into a bitter old housewife thirty years too soon.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s smile wanes. There\u2019s a soft tugging in the vicinity of his heart. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. He can\u2019t seem to look away. \u201cYour eyes are crazy blue,\u201d he finds himself saying.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\u2019s awkward, answering cough should embarrass him, but it doesn\u2019t. \u201cI think we should probably call it a night, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p><p>Dan frowns. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not that late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten-thirty.\u201d </p><p>No, it can\u2019t possibly be. Phil peels his Apple Watch from his wrist and holds it out for Dan to see. \u201cChrist,\u201d Dan says, starting to gather up his towel - which has somehow slipped off somewhere in the midst of the alcohol induced chat. \u201cI should- I\u2019ve got to-\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s getting to his feet, mind already projecting ahead to the million tasks he needs to complete before he can call it a night. For fuck\u2019s sake, he\u2019s somehow spent the whole day slacking off on the slopes and in the hot tub. He\u2019s so lost in his own stupidity that he forgets to ease the weight on his ankle, and cries out as the pain lances through him. He topples to one side, and is immediately caught by two very warm, damp arms. </p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Phil says, like he always does.</p><p>Dan turns to look at him. His expression leaks his own shock that he jumped up to catch Dan at all. Slowly, Dan extricates himself, heart suddenly a kick drum reverberating through the cavity of his chest. </p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0</p><p>In silence, the two of them gather the bottle and glasses, then shuffle to the door. Phil ducks around Dan, who is slow from his limp, and reaches for the door. He shoves it. It doesn\u2019t move. He shoves it again. Nothing. </p><p>Phil turns to Dan, frowning. \u201cWon\u2019t open.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d Dan replies, heart sinking. </p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d Phil says with a shrug. </p><p>Dan reaches out, shoving at the door. It doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cShit,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cAre we locked in?\u201d </p><p>They\u2019ll dehydrate in less than twenty-four hours. Even quicker from the bottle of champagne they\u2019ve downed between them. He turns to Phil, eyes wide. </p><p>\u201cDid you not bring the key?\u201d Phil asks, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cKey?\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cI\u2019ve never known about- this is your bloody fault! I\u2019ve never even been in this sauna, you should have known we needed a key-\u201d</p><p>Dan cuts off. Phil is fighting a smile, lips pressed together. For whatever reason, Dan is pretty sure that he\u2019s about to commit a murder in the next few seconds. He takes a deep breath, and watches with rising levels of pure homicidal rage as Phil pulls on the door handle, and it glides open. </p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t resist,\u201d Phil says, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re too easy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI fucking hate you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I hate you, you hate me. Let\u2019s try and get you across the snow without you breaking your neck.\u201d </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183478354475/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eight!</a>)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br /></b><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a></b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Chapter Seven</b></p><p>The minute Dan&rsquo;s skis are pried off, he limps across the lobby to the reception desk, and flops down into the seat, groaning. &ldquo;Never again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re expecting an apology for &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; you to come skiing-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Dan says, suppressing an eye roll. &ldquo;It was my own stupid fault, I know that. Should&rsquo;ve listened about the bloody skins.&rdquo; </p><p>As if this has reminded him, Phil turns back to where they&rsquo;ve rested their skis against the wall, and begins peeling off the skins from the undersides. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the ankle feeling now?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like it&rsquo;s caught in a steel vice, and someone&rsquo;s slowly grinding the crank,&rdquo; Dan replies, lifting his foot onto his knee so he can examine it for himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Were you a drama kid at school, by any chance?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shoots a glare towards Phil, but it only glances off his back as he makes his way to the stairs. &ldquo;See you later, then,&rdquo; Dan mutters.</p><p>Phil pauses for a fraction of a second, then continues on his way without turning round. For a few minutes, Dan prods and turns his ankle experimentally, testing the limits of his flexibility. If he&rsquo;s unable to get up and down those stairs, he&rsquo;s in huge trouble. He&rsquo;s so focused on the ankle that he doesn&rsquo;t notice Phil reappearing until the bottom stair creaks. In his hand he&rsquo;s got an ice pack, which he hands to Dan across the desk, wordlessly. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ice it for twenty minutes or so,&rdquo; Phil instructs. &ldquo;Should help with the swelling.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay,&rdquo; Dan mutters, hardly listening as he wraps the long pack around the injured area. </p><p>&ldquo;Then I think we should go in the hot tub.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, ok- woah, what?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil now has both forearms on the lip of the desk; there&rsquo;s that hint of a hidden smile tucked beneath his expression. &ldquo;Soaking it for a while would help with the pain.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And you need to accompany me because&hellip;?&rdquo; </p><p>Like a ray of sunlight through thick storm clouds, Phil&rsquo;s smile breaks through. He leans up, rolling his shoulders. &ldquo;I just heaved your bony body a mile across mountain. My muscles could use a soak too.&rdquo; </p><p>Chastened, Dan shrinks into his seat. &ldquo;Right. Of course, sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Worried I&rsquo;m going to ogle you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;N-no! I just&hellip; I dunno, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m even supposed to go in the hot tub. I&rsquo;m not a guest.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Phil says, then actually <i>winks.</i> He stretches his arms behind his back then, chest puffing out, and says, &ldquo;right, I&rsquo;m gonna grab a drink and change. Meet you out there?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I should get that for you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, you&rsquo;re literally hobbled. I can handle getting a drink out of the kitchen fridge.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nods, grateful for this small allowance. &ldquo;Right. Um, fine then. I&rsquo;ll&hellip; I&rsquo;ll meet you out there.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil leaves, heading once more for the stairs, and Dan watches him intently, stomach freely somersaulting as he tries to imagine how the next few hours of his life will go, sat in a hot tub with Phil Novokoric. What will they talk about? The weather? There&rsquo;s only so much to say when it&rsquo;s perpetually freezing. What have they even been talking about all day so far? Dan doesn&rsquo;t remember many&nbsp; awkward silences, but he does remember a lingering feeling of frustration beneath every word they spoke to one another. </p><p>The throbbing in his ankle has been blurring Dan&rsquo;s thoughts into a mess of confusion, particularly on the journey back, but now that the ice pack has begun numbing the pain, all Dan can remember is the sensation of being tucked so tightly against Phil&rsquo;s side. For a long time, they&rsquo;d been closely pressed together, and Phil hadn&rsquo;t so much as complained. Well, he&rsquo;d said that Dan was &lsquo;bony&rsquo;, but it sounded more like an excuse to speak than a real objection. </p><p>For several minutes, Dan replays the long walk back he and Phil shared, trying to remember everything he&rsquo;d said, and whether he should be embarrassed or regretful. It&rsquo;s only when he glances at the clock on the wall that he realises time is ticking by, and he&rsquo;s still fully dressed right down to his coat. With a panicked look towards the mezzanine, he removes the ice pack and stands carefully, managing to limp his way to the side of the room, where the stock cupboard is, tucked out of sight behind a hidden door in the wood-panelled wall. </p><p>In here, he finds a fresh robe, a pair of white swim trunks, and some of the hotel branded slippers. Mona ensures that all of these items are available to guests that might have overlooked packing certain essentials. It&rsquo;s surprising how often they&rsquo;re asked for spare swimwear that guests have forgotten in a haste to make their plane. Dan didn&rsquo;t bring any swim trunks with him because he&rsquo;d never imagined he&rsquo;d need them up here, so spares it is. He carries the garments into Mona&rsquo;s office, peeling off his many layers&nbsp; and slipping on the trunks. </p><p>He already feels alarmingly naked, so dons the slippers and robe, tying it tightly. Before he leaves the office, he catches sight of himself in Mona&rsquo;s small, square mirror tacked to the wall. His hair is wild, mussed up by the hat he&rsquo;d been wearing, so he runs a hand through it, though it makes virtually no difference. His lips seem fuller, pinkened by the icy chill, and his cheeks have a flush to them that won&rsquo;t seem to go away. He doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s his rosacea, this time. </p><p>Turning from his reflection abruptly, Dan focuses on making his way out of the office, then through the lobby to the back door without injuring himself further. Through a technique Dan decides is called &lsquo;furniture balancing&rsquo; he manages to get himself to the back door without putting much weight on his right foot. </p><p>When he gets outside, Phil is already in the jacuzzi. It&rsquo;s an in-ground tub, hexagonal in shape, with wooden skirting that Dan has to go over with a large broom and sweep the snow off every morning. There&rsquo;s a bottle of champagne sat on this skirting, and two glasses beside Phil&rsquo;s elbow, which rests out of the water. </p><p>He turns to Dan, hearing his slow, limping approach. &ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d chickened out,&rdquo; he says. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s freezing,&rdquo; Dan says, teeth already chattering. </p><p>Why had he not thought about the fact he&rsquo;s got virtually no clothes on before now? He wraps his robe tighter around himself. The hairs on his legs are totally erect and he feels like the moisture in his eyes is freezing over. </p><p>&ldquo;Hence the hot tub,&rdquo; Phil says, snorting. </p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, but edges closer, hands tucked into his armpits. Crap, Phil is&hellip; very naked. He has swim trunks on obviously, a deep red blur beneath the water, but Dan can see every hair brushed across his broad chest. He can see the soft bulges of his arm muscles, and collarbones and shoulder blades and long, pale legs. Dan doesn&rsquo;t realise he&rsquo;s staring until Phil meets his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you doing some delayed satisfaction kink-thing? Get in before you contract hypothermia.&rdquo; </p><p>Blushing mostly at hearing Phil say &lsquo;kink&rsquo; which seems somehow unsavoury and titillating at once, Dan says nothing, but tugs at the knot of his robe. He turns away as he removes it, and throws it over the handlebar of the steps, on top of Phil&rsquo;s. He shucks off his slippers, wriggles his bruised ankle experimentally - the purpling colour looks far worse now - and then carefully plunges it into the water. </p><p>Instantly, relief overwhelms him, which is annoying, because it means Phil was right. He can&rsquo;t help the sigh of relief that escapes him even so, blissed out as the throbbing pain recedes, chased off by the pins-and-needles heat of the hot water. So as not to put any weight on the injured ankle, Dan sits down on the top step, and lowers himself in that way. When he&rsquo;s submerged to his waist, he looks up and finds Phil watching him amusedly. </p><p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The scalding-heat-freezing-cold combo is a nice distraction from the agony, yes.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil titters, turning back to the view of the mountains in front of them. He picks up the bottle from behind him, and Dan can see the muscles in his back twisting and sliding. He has to force himself not to stare; it&rsquo;s not because of any sexual desire of course, just that Dan&rsquo;s so unused to seeing real muscle definition, honed by actual effort put in from exercise. When he turns back, Dan&rsquo;s eyes fall to the bottle, and he balks. </p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that like a five-hundred-euro bottle of champagne?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Relax,&rdquo; Phil says, peeling off the foil. &ldquo;My <i>hubby</i> can cover it.&rdquo; </p><p>There&rsquo;s no mistaking the acidity in his tone. Dan hasn&rsquo;t needed it spelled out for him so far, Phil&rsquo;s reluctance and soured face whenever he mentions the name is enough to glean that the subject of Sir Nikolai Novokoric is off-limits. Dan clamps his mouth shut obediently, watching as Phil pops the cork, and pours some into one of the glasses, then takes the other, and pours some into that too. </p><p>He hands one to Dan, who takes it, baffled. &ldquo;Wait, this is for me?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil gives him a strange look. &ldquo;Did you think I brought two glasses out here for myself?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well it&rsquo;s kind of you but, um,&rdquo; Dan falters, distracted by the cool drips of condensation forming on the outside of the glass. As he inhales, the sparkle of the champagne fizzes on his tongue, mingled with the chlorine steam. &ldquo;I-I shouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m technically working.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I forgot you&rsquo;ve got to stay alert for all the many guests that might need your assistance.&rdquo;</p><p>Conflicted, Dan watches Phil tip some of the cool, bubbling liquid into his mouth. His prominent Adams apple bobs, and immediately all Dan can think is that he needs to be not-sober. He takes a sip. </p><p>&ldquo;God, that&rsquo;s divine,&rdquo; Dan mutters, remembering as it slips down his throat that this champagne costs more than he has had in his bank account for some time. &ldquo;Remind me to put this on your tab or Mona will freak out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can pay you for it right now in cash, if it&rsquo;s easier,&rdquo; Phil replies smoothly. </p><p>&ldquo;How the other half live,&rdquo; Dan can&rsquo;t stop himself saying back. </p><p>Phil shoots him a narrow-eyed look that Dan avoids by sipping more champagne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my money.&rdquo; </p><p>With a great deal of effort, Dan manages not to respond to this ludicrous statement. If you marry someone, what&rsquo;s theirs is yours. That&rsquo;s just how it works. For a while, they stew in the painfully awkward silence this money-talk has churned up, sipping from their glasses and pretending to be engrossed in the view. Eventually, Phil shifts across his seat and reaches to a control pad, turning the jets on. The noise of the frothing, bubbling water obliterates the silence in a way that should be unsettling, but actually has Dan melting in relief.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the cacophony, Phil shouts, &ldquo;so, what&rsquo;s your story then?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looks at him, surprised. &ldquo;My story?&rdquo; he asks, voice raised.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In my experience, people don&rsquo;t tend to take jobs high up in the mountains on their own on a whim,&rdquo; he says loudly. </p><p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Dan shouts, prickling with annoyance, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s exactly what I did.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>This admission seems to give Phil enough reason to pause. For a moment, Dan doesn&rsquo;t elaborate, relishing the look of surprise and intrigue on Phil&rsquo;s face. He sips his drink, quietly basking in the cloak of enigma he&rsquo;s draped around himself. Inevitably however, he can&rsquo;t stand the silence stretching. He doesn&rsquo;t particularly want to divulge details about his hideous life to someone he can barely stand, but the champagne is already loosening his tongue, and here, dwarfed by the enormous peaks ahead of them, his old existence and all its many aspects that once seemed so intolerable now seem&hellip; wholly insignificant.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I just looked around one day and realised&hellip; there&rsquo;s not a single thing about my life that I truly enjoy,&rdquo; Dan says, words spilling from his mouth like they&rsquo;ve been gathered there for days, waiting for a chance to emerge. Bubbles tickle the back of his throat as he swallows another mouthful of delicious champagne. &ldquo;So, I dropped it all. Hurled out a load of applications to customer service jobs in different places. I&rsquo;ve worked in retail and waiting jobs part-time for years, so I knew I&rsquo;d have no trouble landing one. Mona emailed me asking if I&rsquo;d be up for something&hellip; remote, and I knew it was the dumbest thing I could possibly do. So I said yes.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And here you are,&rdquo; Phil murmurs. </p><p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; Dan echoes. </p><p>&ldquo;So what was it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What was what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What was it that wasn&rsquo;t making you happy? Hated your boss? No one swiping right on your Tinder profile?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan thinks about asking him exactly why it&rsquo;s any of his damn business, but again that sense of his old life&rsquo;s unimportance washes over him. It laps at his skin like the water he&rsquo;s submerged in, reminding him of how small they are, how similarly ignored by the universe because of their size, their position on the planet. What does it even matter if he tells this man everything? He&rsquo;s only asking to fill the time the two of them have got to kill whilst they&rsquo;re alone up here. It&rsquo;s not like Dan&rsquo;s dull, mediocre story will mean anything to someone like Phil Novokoric; who would he bother to tell? Dan sinks a bit further down, so his shoulders are underwater, and tilts his head back to look into the sky. </p><p>&ldquo;I was at university, studying law,&rdquo; Dan says, mouth twisting into a frown as he remembers the endless thick piles of reading, the leather briefcase his Dad had bought for him to look &lsquo;professional&rsquo;. &ldquo;I only chose it because my Dad told me it was a solid career path. I had a girlfriend. Met her at a party in the first week I was there. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think she even liked me that much. She just knew I was on track to be a lawyer, she found me attractive enough I guess, and that was enough for her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you love her?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan hesitates, the question seeming alien. He&rsquo;s never actually thought about it before, he realises with a start. He wonders why Phil even wants to know such a strange, intimate detail. &ldquo;Not in the way I should have,&rdquo; he answers carefully. He pauses, wondering if he&rsquo;s really about to say the next bit when he&rsquo;s never been able to admit it aloud to anyone. Somehow, up here in the atmosphere, buoyed by alcohol and thin, oxygen-starved air, it just doesn&rsquo;t seem like a big deal. &ldquo;Turns out she&rsquo;s not really&hellip; my type.&rdquo; </p><p>The jets, on a two-minute timer, suddenly cease bubbling. The silence that follows, punctuated only by the slight swilling of water, is excruciating. The weight of his sort-of-admission seems to drag him deeper into the water; why had he said anything at all? Why had he just ripped off his shroud of anonymity for this sneery, snobbish stranger? Before Dan can explode into a full-blown panic attack, Phil chuckles. Dan sits up straight, staring at him in dismay.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you coming out to me?&rdquo; Phil asks.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan splutters, reddening rapidly. &ldquo;Are you <i>laughing</i> at me coming out to you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry,&rdquo; Phil says, though he&rsquo;s <i>still</i> laughing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;A little what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unnecessary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well. You&rsquo;re not exactly subtle. I can tell you fancy me.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s mouth falls open. &ldquo;<i>What</i>?!&rdquo; </p><p>In response, Phil just holds Dan&rsquo;s gaze as he downs the remains of his glass. </p><p>&ldquo;That is- I absolutely do <i>not</i>-&rdquo; Dan is so red that he feels like a slowly boiling lobster. Too outraged to trust himself to respond properly, Dan puts down his glass and splashily shimmies over to the steps, hauling himself out. &ldquo;God, you are unbelievable!&rdquo; he shouts as he goes. &ldquo;Every time I think you might show a shade of decency, you just- just-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil calls, a bubble of laughter in his voice. </p><p>Dan pauses, mostly because he&rsquo;s finding it pretty difficult to make it up the steps in his crippled state. He turns, shivering with cold and fury, back to the man. Phil is staring at him with a combination of pity and amusement, which is an unusual thing to be able to recognise, though Dan is quickly learning that Phil&rsquo;s face is deceptively expressive, but only when he deigns to actually show emotion. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m joking.&rdquo;</p><p>The tension leaks, treacly and slow, from Dan&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Dan can beg the universe to create a whirlpool in this small hot tub and drown them both, Phil stands, water cascading from his body. He runs a hand through his damp hair, then picks up the bottle of champagne and his glass.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we move to the sauna?&rdquo; he asks, steam rising from the miles of his flawless, pale skin. </p><p>Stung with residual anger and humiliation, Dan just nods tightly, and manages to manoeuvre himself, with a fair bit of difficulty, up the steps. Phil follows after, lithe with grace and poise, but he doesn&rsquo;t attempt to overtake Dan as he makes his way across the short distance from the tub to the glass door of the sauna. </p><p>He does, however, dart his arm out to neatly pull the door open before Dan can reach out for it. He holds the door, allowing Dan to limp through, which is infuriatingly chivalrous of him, and Dan has a mind to tell him as much. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a damsel in distress,&rdquo; he says, collapsing on the nearest wooden bench. Immediately, the moisture in his mouth dries up; this small room is ridiculously arid. He comes in once a day to clean it, but there are only four benches, stacked on two levels, so it never takes long. He&rsquo;s never been good with heat, which is why he chose to disappear into the tundra rather than, say, the Indian Desert. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to hold doors for me and bring me ice packs or whatever.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil hands him his glass, which he must have scooped from the edge of the tub on his way. Dan scowls, but takes it anyway, and Phil pours some more champagne into it, then his own. </p><p>&ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re sensitive,&rdquo; Phil says, slumping down onto the adjacent bench. &ldquo;I embarrassed you, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t, like, understand you. You make me feel on edge.&rdquo; Phil raises an eyebrow, sipping his drink. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean I bloody fancy you though, jeez. You&rsquo;re married. And a dick-brain.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil laughs. &ldquo;Dick-brain?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan lowers his glass, displeased with himself for letting that one slip. &ldquo;Prob&rsquo;ly shouldn&rsquo;t have said that out loud. Sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So, you think I&rsquo;m a dick-brain, but you just haven&rsquo;t said it out loud until now?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Um.&rdquo; Dan shifts in his too-hot seat; the backs of his thighs are sticking to the wood. He turns to the burning coals in the corner, wondering if throwing himself upon them would be too dramatic. </p><p>&ldquo;Look, would it help if I divulged some personal crap too? Might help you to relax,&rdquo; Phil suggests. </p><p>&ldquo;Am I not normally relaxed?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shakes his head, then leans back against the wall. &ldquo;Nah, you&rsquo;re kind of&hellip;&rdquo; he flaps his hand in the air. &ldquo;Skittish.&rdquo; </p><p>Hearing this description of himself is startling. He&rsquo;s never considered that other people might see his anxiety leaking out so obviously. Is Phil just a perceptive person, or is it plain as day that Dan is near constantly on edge, always worrying, never truly feeling he can let things go? </p><p>He forces himself to mimic Phil&rsquo;s stance, shoulders slumped, legs slightly apart, head lolling back against the wall behind him. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan says after a while, in what he hopes is a nonchalant voice. &ldquo;Tell me about your husband.&rdquo; </p><p>He can feel Phil&rsquo;s narrow-eyed stare, but Dan focuses resolutely on his glass of champagne, heart pounding because he&rsquo;s never said something so bold in his life. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you a reporter?&rdquo; Phil asks.</p><p>&ldquo;What? No, of course not. Who the hell would I be reporting to up here?&rdquo; </p><p>This seems to placate Phil, though he still looks unhappy with the turn in conversation. &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he says after a moment. &ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan swallows nervously, scratching at his bare thigh where the droplets of pool water are trickling and evaporating. &ldquo;How did it happen? Like&hellip; you met him at uni right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In the library,&rdquo; Phil confirms. There&rsquo;s a silence then, but Dan forces himself not to jump in and fill it, so that Phil will continue. It works. He sighs, shifting to slip a little further down the wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d heard gossip that some heir to Royalty was strutting about campus pretending to learn something. I didn&rsquo;t give it much thought, honestly.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s interest is now fully piqued. He tries not to look too keen for the next part of the story. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo; </p><p>One of Phil&rsquo;s shoulders shrugs. &ldquo;More like I just didn&rsquo;t care. I knew vaguely who he was from the news and stuff, but it just didn&rsquo;t seem anything to do with me. I liked my course, I liked my friends, I was doing well. I just didn&rsquo;t have time to obsess over some rich kid the way everyone else was.&rdquo; </p><p>This is all sounding disturbingly familiar. &ldquo;So what changed?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was in the library one day, working,&rdquo; Phil replies in a quieter voice. His eyes slowly defocus, staring at the empty, gelatinous air hanging in the middle of the room. &ldquo;He just came and sat next to me. He had an entourage of giggling first years lingering around him, sat at the next table over. Actually, it was annoying. I was trying to work. But he didn&rsquo;t disrupt me. He just sat there reading something, and I kept, like, <i>feeling</i> him look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An entourage?&rdquo; Dan asks, finding this hard to believe. &ldquo;Surely he&rsquo;s not that attractive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil fixes him with a curious stare. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what he looks like?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan tries to scrounge up Sir Nikolai&rsquo;s face in his mind. All that comes up is a blank, white face with generic features. He couldn&rsquo;t even say for sure what colour hair the guy has. He shakes his head. &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t really read, like, celeb news.&rdquo; </p><p>For a fleeting second, something akin to respect passes across Phil&rsquo;s features, but it&rsquo;s gone so quickly Dan can&rsquo;t be sure if it was a heat-born mirage. &ldquo;Well, yeah. He&rsquo;s hot. Objectively speaking. Ask pretty much anyone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Dan says. For some reason, this makes him feel strangely irritated, like he wishes Phil would tack on to this statement that Nikolai is also vain or pretentious. &ldquo;So, what, you got into a heated discussion about <i>Sartre</i> in the library caf&eacute; and fell into his arms?&rdquo; </p><p>The corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth quirks. &ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo; He sips some champagne. &ldquo;He asked me for a pen or something, I don&rsquo;t remember. It was just an excuse to talk to me, I think. He told me afterwards that he wasn&rsquo;t even reading the book he had with him. In retrospect, I reckon he probably came into the library to find someone sitting alone, that he could-&rdquo; Phil cuts himself off abruptly. He takes a larger gulp of champagne. &ldquo;Anyway. I was young, and he was gorgeous, and pretty intimidating. He asked me to go on a date with him, and I didn&rsquo;t wanna be the guy who said no to a date with the world&rsquo;s hottest, most eligible bachelor.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nods, chewing this over. He&rsquo;s desperate to probe further into whatever Phil had thought better about saying, but he&rsquo;s already teetering on the edge of his seat, sure that Phil is about to realise he&rsquo;s spewing too much. This is the kind of behind-the-scenes gold that maybe only a handful of people have heard. If he were the sort of person that sold gossip to tabloids, he&rsquo;d probably make a load of cash for this.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Dan says as casually as he can. &ldquo;Did he intimidate you into marrying him, as well?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil snorts with laughter. &ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo; </p><p>A sharp thrill runs through Dan, chased immediately by a pang of guilt. &ldquo;Sorry. I just don&rsquo;t get it. Sure, he&rsquo;s rich, and apparently attractive, but marrying someone is&hellip; y&rsquo;know. Mad. You met him in <i>uni.</i>&nbsp;And committed to be with him for the rest of your life.&rdquo; </p><p>A faint, amused smile graces Phil&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Guess where he took me on our first date?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shrugs, not giving much thought to the unexpected question. &ldquo;Dinner at some extravagant restaurant?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Paris.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes bulge. &ldquo;Holy shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d he do for the second date?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil laughs. &ldquo;He rented out a cinema and screened <i>Kill Bill</i>, which was my favourite film at the time. And he hired a Michelin star chef to provide us with cocktails and gourmet popcorn.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Dan shakes his head, marvelling. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s insane. I&rsquo;ve never even <i>smelled</i> the amount of money he must have spent on that.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil nods, musing. &ldquo;Kind of a waste, too. We didn&rsquo;t watch much of the film, as far as I remember.&rdquo; </p><p>The temperature seems to rise a good few degrees; Dan is sure he&rsquo;s beginning to resemble a boiled sweet. &ldquo;I guess it must be pretty nice to have someone do all that for you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, though,&rdquo; Phil replies, smile slipping. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do anything. That much money is all smoke and mirrors. I was so young. I grew up in a working class family, took out a loan to go to uni like everyone else. I&rsquo;d never touched wealth like that. It was overwhelming.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan considers this, letting Phil&rsquo;s words fold slowly into his champagne-gauzed mind. He hadn&rsquo;t been aware of Phil&rsquo;s background until now; he&rsquo;d just assumed he&rsquo;d grown up rich. It&rsquo;s bizarre to think that once, the two of them were probably quite similar. They might even have been friends before Nikolai swooped Phil off to a life of luxury. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought I was in love,&rdquo; Phil says, maybe to himself. He lifts the bottle of champagne, and refills his glass, then leans over to pour some into Dan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;But it was infatuation. It&rsquo;s hard to discern if something&rsquo;s real when it&rsquo;s dripping in diamonds.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Dan chews his lip, wondering whether this is a step too far. In the end, the champagne decides to push the question out regardless. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love him?&rdquo;</p><p>If Phil is annoyed by the intrusive question, he doesn&rsquo;t show it. He just shakes his head. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t love me either. So I don&rsquo;t feel too bad.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Dan says quietly. &ldquo;He must have wanted you. He asked you to marry him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He just wanted a story,&rdquo; Phil says, dejectedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s obsessed with fame. With being this renegade-Royal, upsetting his father and behaving obscenely. He announced that he was bi, but nobody cared. So he one-upped himself. Found the nearest nobody and seduced him with cash and grand gestures. You should&rsquo;ve seen the ring he gave me when he asked.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes fall to the ring on Phil&rsquo;s finger now. It&rsquo;s silver, and shiny, but simple, demure. Phil follows Dan&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t it. The engagement ring is in a safe somewhere now. He let me choose something a bit less extravagant for the wedding, thank God.&rdquo;</p><p>The words&nbsp;&lsquo;let me&rsquo; leap out at Dan, making him frown.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine being married right now,&rdquo; Dan confesses. &ldquo;You were my age, right?&rdquo; </p><p>So, <i>perhaps</i> Dan&rsquo;s done a little digging in his down time.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil squints at him. &ldquo;I was twenty-one when we got married.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Younger than me, then. Is it weird?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m drowning in marital bliss, let&rsquo;s put it that way. His press agent sees him more than I do.&rdquo; </p><p>From the way Phil describes him, along with the vague bits and pieces Dan&rsquo;s gleaned from news articles over the years, he strongly suspects that Sir Nikolai is an even worse version of Phil himself. Arrogant, snobby, unfeeling. Why anyone would want to be associated with such a man, let alone be married to him, is entirely baffling. Then again, Dan supposes that Phil was absurdly young to have been expected to work this out. He&rsquo;d confused Sir Nikolai&rsquo;s grand, extravagant gestures for actual affection, as any ordinary twenty-one-year-old undoubtedly would. In the eyes of someone so naive to the perils of dating, Sir Nikolai probably seemed like some fairytale prince, rescuing Phil from a life of mundanity. Despite Dan&rsquo;s twenty-first year being spent firmly in the closet, with a girlfriend, he&rsquo;s not sure he would have been able to resist Sir Nikolai himself, back then. </p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have to stay up here?&rdquo; Dan asks, still thinking. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you go and be with him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A good question,&rdquo; Phil says with a snort. &ldquo;I ask him that every time we speak. It&rsquo;s always something vague. The paparazzi are out for my blood. News of the two of us sighted together would overshadow whatever project he&rsquo;s currently working on. I&rsquo;d be bored to pieces trailing around after him. It&rsquo;s all bollocks. It&rsquo;s just easier for him if I&rsquo;m kept far away, only brought out when I need to be.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; why here?&rdquo; Dan asks, gesturing to the door of the sauna, outside of which the mountain lies, stunning and ferocious. &ldquo;Surely he has mansions or castles he could stow you in?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shrugs. &ldquo;Sure. Loads. It wouldn&rsquo;t make much of a difference, though. A cage is still a cage, no matter how shiny the bars. Initially he sold this place to me as a suite in a remote, exotic mountain retreat, available to me for as long as I liked. He told me the staff would wait on me hand and foot, that I could ski, totally undisturbed, and that I could stay there indefinitely.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows raise. &ldquo;When you put it like that, it sounds amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. He didn&rsquo;t mention that leaving was basically not allowed.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not allowed,&rdquo; Dan repeats, not bothering to hide his disgust. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s appalling. That&rsquo;s how he treats his <i>husband</i>. Like you&rsquo;re a pet or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rich-kid mentality,&rdquo; Phil says, nodding. &ldquo;Always greedy for the next shiny toy. He&rsquo;d stop at nothing to get me, but once he got me, he was bored. Locked me away in the toy box.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So just divorce him,&rdquo; Dan blurts. </p><p>In the next mortified second, Dan tries in vain to summon the Gods to turn back time. This champagne is unscrewing his inhibitions in a dangerous way. Phil, thankfully, just seems amused by his sudden boldness.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as easy as that,&rdquo; he replies with gentle condescension. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got an army of lawyers that would fight tooth and nail to keep a messy divorce from happening. His reputation would suffer if anyone caught wind that I wasn&rsquo;t totally besotted with the darling of the Swiss monarchy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You think they&rsquo;d buy you off or something, to keep you quiet?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;More likely they&rsquo;d just threaten to leave me with nothing,&rdquo; Phil says with a resigned sigh, suggesting he&rsquo;s thought about this a lot. &ldquo;Can you imagine if I tried to go up in a legal battle against someone that powerful? I come from nothing. I never even finished my degree. All my money comes from him. I don&rsquo;t have a place to live, no job, nothing. He owns me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck <i>that</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil laughs, louder and fuller than Dan has heard since earlier at the bottom of the slope, what seems like a lifetime ago. The sauna is tilting gently from side to side, like it&rsquo;s bobbing on a calm sea. It&rsquo;s quite pleasant, like being rocked in a large, very warm cradle. To further this concept, Dan decides to lie down on the bench, staring up at the wooden ceiling. </p><p>&ldquo;Nobody owns you, Phil,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s suddenly saying. &ldquo;You can go back and finish your degree if you want. You&rsquo;re young. Too young to be stuck up here all alone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Interesting that you don&rsquo;t seem to be taking your own advice,&rdquo; Phil points out.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan tilts his head back, seeing Phil upside-down. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; different.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Phil sips more champagne, his amusement stretching across his upside-down mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;cause like&hellip;&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s mind swims; he can&rsquo;t remember his own arguments. Did he ever even have any? &ldquo;Okay, okay, fine. You&rsquo;re right. We&rsquo;re both hiding up here &lsquo;cause we can&rsquo;t face how scary reality is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; Phil agrees. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought we&rsquo;d find common ground?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan snorts, then sits up and drains the last of his glass. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t go that far.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No? I&rsquo;m still a dick-brain, then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Dan hiccups. &ldquo;Sorry, mate. Your husband&rsquo;s shit, but there&rsquo;s no excuse for rudeness.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil chuckles. &ldquo;Even though I said sorry?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still rude to me!&rdquo; </p><p>Dan sets his glass down, then nearly knocks it off the bench as he attempts to get comfortable. Luckily, Phil swoops in and grabs it just in time. He&rsquo;s smiling, tickled by Dan&rsquo;s clumsiness. &ldquo;I used to be nice, you know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right, sure. Before fame changed you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Before I grew into a bitter old housewife thirty years too soon.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s smile wanes. There&rsquo;s a soft tugging in the vicinity of his heart. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says. He can&rsquo;t seem to look away. &ldquo;Your eyes are crazy blue,&rdquo; he finds himself saying.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s awkward, answering cough should embarrass him, but it doesn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;I think we should probably call it a night, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan frowns. &ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s not that late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten-thirty.&rdquo; </p><p>No, it can&rsquo;t possibly be. Phil peels his Apple Watch from his wrist and holds it out for Dan to see. &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; Dan says, starting to gather up his towel - which has somehow slipped off somewhere in the midst of the alcohol induced chat. &ldquo;I should- I&rsquo;ve got to-&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s getting to his feet, mind already projecting ahead to the million tasks he needs to complete before he can call it a night. For fuck&rsquo;s sake, he&rsquo;s somehow spent the whole day slacking off on the slopes and in the hot tub. He&rsquo;s so lost in his own stupidity that he forgets to ease the weight on his ankle, and cries out as the pain lances through him. He topples to one side, and is immediately caught by two very warm, damp arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; Phil says, like he always does.</p><p>Dan turns to look at him. His expression leaks his own shock that he jumped up to catch Dan at all. Slowly, Dan extricates himself, heart suddenly a kick drum reverberating through the cavity of his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, thanks,&rdquo; Dan says.&nbsp;</p><p>In silence, the two of them gather the bottle and glasses, then shuffle to the door. Phil ducks around Dan, who is slow from his limp, and reaches for the door. He shoves it. It doesn&rsquo;t move. He shoves it again. Nothing. </p><p>Phil turns to Dan, frowning. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t open.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not serious,&rdquo; Dan replies, heart sinking. </p><p>&ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; Phil says with a shrug. </p><p>Dan reaches out, shoving at the door. It doesn&rsquo;t budge. &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Dan mutters. &ldquo;Are we locked in?&rdquo; </p><p>They&rsquo;ll dehydrate in less than twenty-four hours. Even quicker from the bottle of champagne they&rsquo;ve downed between them. He turns to Phil, eyes wide. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you not bring the key?&rdquo; Phil asks, incredulous. </p><p>&ldquo;Key?&rdquo; Dan repeats. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known about- this is your bloody fault! I&rsquo;ve never even been in this sauna, you should have known we needed a key-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan cuts off. Phil is fighting a smile, lips pressed together. For whatever reason, Dan is pretty sure that he&rsquo;s about to commit a murder in the next few seconds. He takes a deep breath, and watches with rising levels of pure homicidal rage as Phil pulls on the door handle, and it glides open. </p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t resist,&rdquo; Phil says, laughing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too easy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I fucking hate you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, I hate you, you hate me. Let&rsquo;s try and get you across the snow without you breaking your neck.&rdquo; </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183478354475/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eight!</a>)</b></p>",
