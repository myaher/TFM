        "body": "<p>I\u2019ve seen vague posts and had short conversations about this with friends, but I really want to write it out.</p><p>Most of us are pretty excited about the Detective Pikachu movie, including myself. It looks like a fun, interesting, and especially unique Pokemon movie and I will most likely be seeing it when it comes out. However, I frankly won\u2019t be able to enjoy it to the fullest due to one thing in particular: its art direction.</p><p>What do I mean by that?</p><p>I mean that the art direction is ALL OVER THE PLACE.\u00a0</p><p>Art direction is, to me and many others, the most important part of any project. It\u2019s what ties everything together within a world, it\u2019s what makes a world interesting. Visually appealing, unique, and consistent art direction is everything. It\u2019s what first draws someone\u2019s attention. If the art direction in a show, a movie, a video game, any visual thing, doesn\u2019t come together, if it isn\u2019t consistent, it ruins an experience. And sometimes even <i>that </i>isn\u2019t enough.\u00a0</p><p>In video games especially (and also quite commonly in movies now) the art direction might be <i>consistent </i>but it\u2019s&hellip;not much else. For some reason, a lot of [mostly Triple A and larger \u201cindie\u201d(?)] video game companies have decided that \u201cart direction\u201d means\u00a0\u201cmake it look as realistic as possible\u201d. And I\u2019ll tell you what; that? Is boring as hell. Same with movies. It\u2019s why I\u2019m not interested in most\u00a0\u201clive action\u201d movies, whether they be comedy, action/thriller, romance, or any other combination of genres. They\u2019re just <i>visually boring</i>.</p><p>What\u2019s really frustrating to me about this is that you <i>can </i>have realistic graphics/visuals and still have visually appealing and/or unique art direction. (I.E. Video Games: Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Assassin\u2019s Creed, Red Dead Redemption | Movies: The Matrix (I guess works as an example for this?), World War Z, Mad Max (from what scenes/images I\u2019ve seen of it lol))</p><p>With Detective Pikachu, the art direction takes an obviously realistic route, given the fact that it\u2019s, you know, live action. And it\u2019s certainly a <i>unique </i>direction. But the problem here is that the art direction just hasn\u2019t convinced me in the <i>slightest </i>that those Pokemon are <i>real</i> animals, all in the same universe.</p><p>And what do I mean by <i>that?</i></p><!-- more --><p>If you told me that Pokemon like Charizard, Bulbasaur, Lickitung, Mr. Mime, etc. were\u00a0\u201creal\u201d animals I\u2019d say, okay, sure, why not? They look like actual animals in that universe, more or less. Now, what do those Pokemon have in common? Why do I see them as fitting in within that world?</p><p>They don\u2019t have fur. And that\u2019s really the thing I want to talk about here in regards to the movie\u2019s art direction. The Pokemon with fur don\u2019t work.</p><p>We\u2019ll start with the star Pokemon: Pikachu. Pikachu has been described since its creation to be a\u00a0\u201cmouse Pokemon\u201d. A rodent. However, when I see what Pikachu looks like in this movie, I don\u2019t see &ldquo;mouse\u201d, I see fluffy plush toy-thing come to life. I also see\u00a0\u201ccat\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The way his fur is rendered isn\u2019t that of a mouse or really any small (or many larger) rodent that I know of. The fur is too long, too soft, too plush. His face looks more like a cat than it does some kind of rodent. The nose and mouth are feline in nature, and that\u2019s strange to me.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"382\" data-orig-height=\"410\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd1a7d5a09b85ec21440014882a83bb7/tumblr_inline_pof27zo1h61qmsspi_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"382\" data-orig-height=\"410\"/></figure><p>That\u2019s not a\u00a0\u201cmouse pokemon\u201d. It\u2019s not a bad design, no, and it\u2019s certainly cute. But\u00a0\u201cmouse pokemon\u201d? That\u2019s what Pikachu is and what it always has been, and for the artists to simply ignore that doesn\u2019t feel right to me.

His stuff has been reposted a few dozen times on this website alone, with or (usually) without credit, and the majority of pokemon fans have probably seen at least <i>one </i>piece.</p><p>The most influence he\u2019s had with these movie designs that I\u2019ve seen has been the Charizard.

Pikachu has been described since its creation to be a\u00a0\u201cmouse Pokemon\u201d. A rodent.

I also see\u00a0\u201ccat\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The way his fur is rendered isn\u2019t that of a mouse or really any small (or many larger) rodent that I know of. The fur is too long, too soft, too plush. His face looks more like a cat than it does some kind of rodent.

It looks like a fun, interesting, and especially unique Pokemon movie and I will most likely be seeing it when it comes out. However, I frankly won\u2019t be able to enjoy it to the fullest due to one thing in particular: its art direction.</p><p>What do I mean by that?</p><p>I mean that the art direction is ALL OVER THE PLACE.\u00a0</p><p>Art direction is, to me and many others, the most important part of any project. It\u2019s what ties everything together within a world, it\u2019s what makes a world interesting. Visually appealing, unique, and consistent art direction is everything. It\u2019s what first draws someone\u2019s attention. If the art direction in a show, a movie, a video game, any visual thing, doesn\u2019t come together, if it isn\u2019t consistent, it ruins an experience. And sometimes even <i>that </i>isn\u2019t enough.\u00a0</p><p>In video games especially (and also quite commonly in movies now) the art direction might be <i>consistent </i>but it\u2019s\u2026not much else. For some reason, a lot of [mostly Triple A and larger \u201cindie\u201d(?)] video game companies have decided that \u201cart direction\u201d means\u00a0\u201cmake it look as realistic as possible\u201d. And I\u2019ll tell you what; that? Is boring as hell. Same with movies. It\u2019s why I\u2019m not interested in most\u00a0\u201clive action\u201d movies, whether they be comedy, action/thriller, romance, or any other combination of genres. They\u2019re just <i>visually boring</i>.</p><p>What\u2019s really frustrating to me about this is that you <i>can </i>have realistic graphics/visuals and still have visually appealing and/or unique art direction. (I.E. Video Games: Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Assassin\u2019s Creed, Red Dead Redemption | Movies: The Matrix (I guess works as an example for this?), World War Z, Mad Max (from what scenes/images I\u2019ve seen of it lol))</p><p>With Detective Pikachu, the art direction takes an obviously realistic route, given the fact that it\u2019s, you know, live action. And it\u2019s certainly a <i>unique </i>direction. But the problem here is that the art direction just hasn\u2019t convinced me in the <i>slightest </i>that those Pokemon are <i>real</i> animals, all in the same universe.</p><p>And what do I mean by <i>that?</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>If you told me that Pokemon like Charizard, Bulbasaur, Lickitung, Mr. Mime, etc. were\u00a0\u201creal\u201d animals I\u2019d say, okay, sure, why not? They look like actual animals in that universe, more or less. Now, what do those Pokemon have in common? Why do I see them as fitting in within that world?</p><p>They don\u2019t have fur. And that\u2019s really the thing I want to talk about here in regards to the movie\u2019s art direction. The Pokemon with fur don\u2019t work.</p><p>We\u2019ll start with the star Pokemon: Pikachu. Pikachu has been described since its creation to be a\u00a0\u201cmouse Pokemon\u201d. A rodent. However, when I see what Pikachu looks like in this movie, I don\u2019t see \u201cmouse\u201d, I see fluffy plush toy-thing come to life. I also see\u00a0\u201ccat\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The way his fur is rendered isn\u2019t that of a mouse or really any small (or many larger) rodent that I know of. The fur is too long, too soft, too plush. His face looks more like a cat than it does some kind of rodent. The nose and mouth are feline in nature, and that\u2019s strange to me.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"382\" data-orig-height=\"410\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd1a7d5a09b85ec21440014882a83bb7/tumblr_inline_pof27zo1h61qmsspi_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"382\" data-orig-height=\"410\"></figure><p>That\u2019s not a\u00a0\u201cmouse pokemon\u201d. It\u2019s not a bad design, no, and it\u2019s certainly cute. But\u00a0\u201cmouse pokemon\u201d? That\u2019s what Pikachu is and what it always has been, and for the artists to simply ignore that doesn\u2019t feel right to me. It also just doesn\u2019t <i>look </i>right to me.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"312\" data-orig-height=\"236\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/57672ddced99f53d7beac137bafc7a47/tumblr_inline_pof2hmdaQp1qmsspi_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"312\" data-orig-height=\"236\"></figure><p>here is a picture of a mouse. It has much shorter, more wiry and flatter fur that follows the form of its body instead of sticking out like it does on Pikachu. THIS is what I always imagined Pikachu to look like were it to be\u00a0\u201creal\u201d. It\u2019s what the <i>cartoon </i>always looked like. The only longer fur to ever really be shown on Pikachus is a tuft of fur on their heads (See: Sparky). Never have I thought of Pikachu being fluffy in any way before. Its character design never ever told me that.</p><p>When I see the DP Pikachu I don\u2019t see an animal that exists as an <i>animal </i>in that world.<i> It doesn\u2019t look like a real animal</i>. It just looks like a really fluffy toy.</p><p>Also the tail?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"150\" data-orig-height=\"199\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d99f68850823025d8b5d1d2a3df92082/tumblr_inline_pof2ufRVvs1qmsspi_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"150\" data-orig-height=\"199\"></figure><p>I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s going on with that fur.

But more as if you described what a dog looked like to someone who had never seen a dog and then told them to draw it.</p><p>Growlithes are really cute pokemon, but these? These aren\u2019t cute. They look dirty. The fur lays on the body weird, the longer fur on the head especially confuses me. The fur doesn\u2019t travel along the body the way a dog\u2019s fur does. Even a dirty dog. It\u2019s stiff, chunky. Please give them a bath.</p><p>Also apparently this is what Arcanine looks like?\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1165\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/11f076355de30ee2e58fcc502d7fd183/tumblr_inline_pof3fkJggD1qmsspi_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1165\"></figure><p>I don\u2019t remember seeing this in a trailer, and googling showed me like, DP themed pokemon cards??? No clue. But regardless, this looks okay! The head/snout shape is a little off, but overall it LOOKS GOOD! The way the fur looks here, how it shapes and falls over the body, that\u2019s what it should look like. Why couldn\u2019t Growlithe look more like like this? Why can\u2019t <i>Pikachu </i>look like this? They don\u2019t even look like they belong in the same movie.</p><p>Next: Pyduck!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"388\" data-orig-height=\"338\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/abd4cef8557fe07548711e82a63fccb6/tumblr_inline_pof4swoBad1qmsspi_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"388\" data-orig-height=\"338\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"417\" data-orig-height=\"403\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30a000bfc1063afd4574b568283a6ff5/tumblr_inline_pof4tmiUqz1qmsspi_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"417\" data-orig-height=\"403\"></figure><p>Yeah That\u2019s A Duck.</p><p>At least they didn\u2019t give it fur, I guess. But they did their best to make it look like they did.</p><p>My biggest issue with this is that it doesn\u2019t look like a water bird. They just took Psyduck and made it \u201creal\u201d, badly. I mean, its name is Psy<i>duck</i> for Pete\u2019s sake, at least <i>try </i>to make it look like a duck. It doesn\u2019t even have to look like an adult duck.

It&rsquo;s what ties everything together within a world, it&rsquo;s what makes a world interesting. Visually appealing, unique, and consistent art direction is everything. It&rsquo;s what first draws someone&rsquo;s attention. If the art direction in a show, a movie, a video game, any visual thing, doesn&rsquo;t come together, if it isn&rsquo;t consistent, it ruins an experience. And sometimes even <i>that </i>isn&rsquo;t enough.&nbsp;</p><p>In video games especially (and also quite commonly in movies now) the art direction might be <i>consistent </i>but it&rsquo;s&hellip;not much else. For some reason, a lot of [mostly Triple A and larger &ldquo;indie&rdquo;(?)] video game companies have decided that &ldquo;art direction&rdquo; means&nbsp;&ldquo;make it look as realistic as possible&rdquo;. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what; that? Is boring as hell. Same with movies. It&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not interested in most&nbsp;&ldquo;live action&rdquo; movies, whether they be comedy, action/thriller, romance, or any other combination of genres. They&rsquo;re just <i>visually boring</i>.</p><p>What&rsquo;s really frustrating to me about this is that you <i>can </i>have realistic graphics/visuals and still have visually appealing and/or unique art direction. (I.E. Video Games: Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, Red Dead Redemption | Movies: The Matrix (I guess works as an example for this?), World War Z, Mad Max (from what scenes/images I&rsquo;ve seen of it lol))</p><p>With Detective Pikachu, the art direction takes an obviously realistic route, given the fact that it&rsquo;s, you know, live action. And it&rsquo;s certainly a <i>unique </i>direction. But the problem here is that the art direction just hasn&rsquo;t convinced me in the <i>slightest </i>that those Pokemon are <i>real</i> animals, all in the same universe.</p><p>And what do I mean by <i>that?</i></p><p>If you told me that Pokemon like Charizard, Bulbasaur, Lickitung, Mr. Mime, etc. were&nbsp;&ldquo;real&rdquo; animals I&rsquo;d say, okay, sure, why not? They look like actual animals in that universe, more or less. Now, what do those Pokemon have in common? Why do I see them as fitting in within that world?</p><p>They don&rsquo;t have fur. And that&rsquo;s really the thing I want to talk about here in regards to the movie&rsquo;s art direction. The Pokemon with fur don&rsquo;t work.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll start with the star Pokemon: Pikachu. Pikachu has been described since its creation to be a&nbsp;&ldquo;mouse Pokemon&rdquo;. A rodent. However, when I see what Pikachu looks like in this movie, I don&rsquo;t see &ldquo;mouse&rdquo;, I see fluffy plush toy-thing come to life. I also see&nbsp;&ldquo;cat&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>The way his fur is rendered isn&rsquo;t that of a mouse or really any small (or many larger) rodent that I know of. The fur is too long, too soft, too plush. His face looks more like a cat than it does some kind of rodent. The nose and mouth are feline in nature, and that&rsquo;s strange to me.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd1a7d5a09b85ec21440014882a83bb7/tumblr_inline_pof27zo1h61qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>That&rsquo;s not a&nbsp;&ldquo;mouse pokemon&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not a bad design, no, and it&rsquo;s certainly cute. But&nbsp;&ldquo;mouse pokemon&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s what Pikachu is and what it always has been, and for the artists to simply ignore that doesn&rsquo;t feel right to me. It also just doesn&rsquo;t <i>look </i>right to me.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/57672ddced99f53d7beac137bafc7a47/tumblr_inline_pof2hmdaQp1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>here is a picture of a mouse. It has much shorter, more wiry and flatter fur that follows the form of its body instead of sticking out like it does on Pikachu. THIS is what I always imagined Pikachu to look like were it to be&nbsp;&ldquo;real&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s what the <i>cartoon </i>always looked like. The only longer fur to ever really be shown on Pikachus is a tuft of fur on their heads (See: Sparky). Never have I thought of Pikachu being fluffy in any way before. Its character design never ever told me that.</p><p>When I see the DP Pikachu I don&rsquo;t see an animal that exists as an <i>animal </i>in that world.<i> It doesn&rsquo;t look like a real animal</i>. It just looks like a really fluffy toy.</p><p>Also the tail?</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d99f68850823025d8b5d1d2a3df92082/tumblr_inline_pof2ufRVvs1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what&rsquo;s going on with that fur. But anyway-</p><p>How about we talk about Growlithe.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed3a2aa1ef625a45d29e4f771e507f78/tumblr_inline_pof33cyH3b1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>My first response to this was&nbsp;&ldquo;Um.&rdquo; My second was&nbsp;&ldquo;is that supposed to be a dog?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>I mean I guess it <i>kind of</i> looks like a dog. But more as if you described what a dog looked like to someone who had never seen a dog and then told them to draw it.</p><p>Growlithes are really cute pokemon, but these? These aren&rsquo;t cute. They look dirty. The fur lays on the body weird, the longer fur on the head especially confuses me. The fur doesn&rsquo;t travel along the body the way a dog&rsquo;s fur does. Even a dirty dog. It&rsquo;s stiff, chunky. Please give them a bath.</p><p>Also apparently this is what Arcanine looks like?&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/11f076355de30ee2e58fcc502d7fd183/tumblr_inline_pof3fkJggD1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I don&rsquo;t remember seeing this in a trailer, and googling showed me like, DP themed pokemon cards??? No clue. But regardless, this looks okay! The head/snout shape is a little off, but overall it LOOKS GOOD! The way the fur looks here, how it shapes and falls over the body, that&rsquo;s what it should look like. Why couldn&rsquo;t Growlithe look more like like this? Why can&rsquo;t <i>Pikachu </i>look like this? They don&rsquo;t even look like they belong in the same movie.</p><p>Next: Pyduck!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/abd4cef8557fe07548711e82a63fccb6/tumblr_inline_pof4swoBad1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30a000bfc1063afd4574b568283a6ff5/tumblr_inline_pof4tmiUqz1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Yeah That&rsquo;s A Duck.</p><p>At least they didn&rsquo;t give it fur, I guess. But they did their best to make it look like they did.</p><p>My biggest issue with this is that it doesn&rsquo;t look like a water bird. They just took Psyduck and made it &ldquo;real&rdquo;, badly. I mean, its name is Psy<i>duck</i> for Pete&rsquo;s sake, at least <i>try </i>to make it look like a duck. It doesn&rsquo;t even have to look like an adult duck. If it looked more like this in face/feather texture it&rsquo;d be fine</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/03bb2d3527b233a47b882d04bcf4429c/tumblr_inline_pof5d2OFwv1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And that&rsquo;s probably what it&rsquo;s SUPPOSED to look like. A young duck. But instead they gave it short stubby feathers that look too much like fur and a much too thick bill (even compared to the original cartoon design).</p><p>Last one I want to talk about because if I continued with other pokemon <strike>Snorlax,Flareon,etc</strike> I&rsquo;d be writing for like three hours: Aipom</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/807f55620fc91a8986718bc1a9bc287c/tumblr_inline_pof3nbE5U01qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>good christ was is that thing</b></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re</i> telling <i>me </i>that that&rsquo;s an Aipom. <i>That </i>thing. Is an <i>Aipom</i>.</p><p>Not only does it not look like an Aipom in anything but color, it doesn&rsquo;t even look like a <i>monkey</i>. And what&rsquo;s up with its teeth?</p><p>If they wanted to convince me that this thing is a real animal within this universe living alongside all these other animals they should have:</p><p>1. Actually used monkeys as references when designing it? Because they obviously didn&rsquo;t</p><p>2. Given it, hands?? And not weird nubs??? Nubs don&rsquo;t work on monkeys in a realistic setting what the hell it looks <i>deformed&nbsp;</i></p><p>3. Not&hellip;given is perfectly straight, shiny, white human teeth.</p><p>All those things look fine on its original cartoon design, but LORD in heaven this thing is a absolute monstrosity.</p><p>The thing about all these and many of the other furred pokemon (Snorlax being a REALLY big culprit) is that the artists just&hellip;didn&rsquo;t look at real life animals enough. They clearly focused on just the Pokemons&rsquo; cartoon designs, took those, and&nbsp;&ldquo;made them real&rdquo; while making the minimum amount of changes. You can&rsquo;t just&hellip;take a cartoon and<i>&nbsp;make it real</i>. That never works.</p><p>All of these different designs work when in context of the shows or the games because the shows and the games have a <i>coherent art direction made specifically for the media they&rsquo;re presented in. </i>They were <i>never </i>meant to exist in a realistic setting like this.</p><p>It always requires some kind of adaptions, some changes, adjustments to the original design, just&nbsp;<i>something </i>when making a cartoon look real. And they didn&rsquo;t do that here. And the best part about all this?</p><p>They got <b>RJ Palmer</b> (website linked in source) to work on the project. RJ is an amazing artist/illustrator, one of my favorites, who is probably best known <i>for</i> his&nbsp;&ldquo;realistic Pokemon&rdquo;. His stuff has been reposted a few dozen times on this website alone, with or (usually) without credit, and the majority of pokemon fans have probably seen at least <i>one </i>piece.</p><p>The most influence he&rsquo;s had with these movie designs that I&rsquo;ve seen has been the Charizard. I saw that Charizard in the trailer and <i>knew </i>it was RJ&rsquo;s. But if not for that Charizard (and the fact that he said he worked on this movie of course), I would have never known he had any part in this.</p><p>Compare the above to his art that I&rsquo;m about to show you (I specifically chose Pokemon appearing in the movie for convenience&rsquo;s sake, but I highly recommend that you check out his other realistic Pokemon art as well), and tell me that, if you didn&rsquo;t know any better, you&rsquo;d think that this guy worked on this movie.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7bdfc9a3d900635728636846422ffeb2/tumblr_inline_pof8fngp161qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/482f2d20e81fc0237e95f497413049a3/tumblr_inline_pof8cmFQ6o1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7044c8d4925cc8acd8f497ec9f868426/tumblr_inline_pof8l0eWDi1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/638d93973a9fedbd5902070d277a9b4e/tumblr_inline_pof8p1Yoqp1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6b4337d901a8aba9ffd954bd2660d02/tumblr_inline_pof8rrGqDc1qmsspi_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Just to name a few.</p><p>And yeah, obviously I don&rsquo;t, and never will, expect Nintendo/Game Freak to go <i>this </i>far. But at the same time, if you&rsquo;re going to get THIS artist to work on your Pokemon movie, the least you could do is make it LOOK like he worked on the gosh darn movie!</p><p>The art direction he has in his work is beautiful. All of these creatures look like Pokemon while also being <i>influenced </i>and actually<i> looking like</i> real animals. And following that more with the <i>movie&rsquo;s</i> art direction would have done nothing but improve it. It certainly would have been more convincing for me and many others.</p><p>I obviously don&rsquo;t want them to look exactly like RJ&rsquo;s artwork, but the designs do need to be more uniform, and following the practices RJ clearly does would have helped that.</p><p>All that said, RJ is rightfully excited and proud of this project. It&rsquo;s looking like it&rsquo;ll be a wonderful movie.</p><p>I just wish the art direction was better.</p>",
