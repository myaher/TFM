        "body": "<h2><b>A Quick Dip</b></h2><p><b><i>12. Spiderman and Iron Man vs the Vulture (and a plane)</i></b></p><p>Peter gripped the Iron Man suit, doing his best to ignore the aches and pains as he moved. His ribs were killing him, and he had a sneaking suspicion that one might be broken. At least one. He could tell that the little cuts and bruises were healing, but this old suit didn\u2019t connect to Karen so he couldn\u2019t see anything about his vitals or what possible injuries he might have. He figured he could lay down when this was all done&hellip;sleep it off. He tried not to think of Liz&hellip;tried not to think about the fact that he was about to fight her dad. Or the fact that he\u2019d left her at a Homecoming dance. Alone.</p><p>She probably hated him now.</p><p>\u201cYou good kid?\u201d Mr. Stark called, and Peter nodded before realizing that Mr. Stark couldn\u2019t see him, considering he was on the man\u2019s back, gripping the armor as Iron Man shot through the sky.</p><p>\u201cRight. Yeah. I\u2019m good.\u201d He nodded again, more out of habit than anything else, practically screaming his words.</p><p>It was getting colder the higher they went, and Peter shivered, losing his grip for just a second. \u201cPete?\u201d Mr. Stark called back to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d Peter explained, matching his tone, and Mr. Stark went quiet for a moment, but then the outside of the armor began to heat up. \u201cOh! Thanks!\u201d He yelled over the wind, cuddling a little closer. He felt more than heard the man chuckle, the armor shooting forward until they were close enough to see the plane in the distance.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Underoos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d He called, releasing him with one hand and lifting a webshooter to aim. The plan was a little&hellip;well&hellip;nonexistent really. They had just agreed to find the plane and stop the Vulture. He\u2019d called Happy to give him some warning, but there wasn\u2019t much Happy could do. Still, Peter was getting the chance to fight with Iron Man! Some part of him, the part that wasn\u2019t just a little terrified, was thrilled.</p><!-- more --><p>He hadn\u2019t expected Mr. Stark to show up at the warehouse. Not at all. Honestly, he hadn\u2019t thought that Ned would be able to get through to him since he doubted Mr. Stark answered calls from random numbers. But then he\u2019d turned around, right as he\u2019d heard a ruble from above his head, and Iron Man had been there, reaching out an arm&hellip;and then they\u2019d both been buried under the rubble.</p><p>When he\u2019d come to&hellip;only seconds, it had seemed, after the collapse, he\u2019d heard Mr. Stark yelling for him. Sounding afraid. Worried. The same way he\u2019d sounded when he had reached out for Peter&hellip;when Mr. Toomes had made the whole thing fall. He\u2019d been so afraid&hellip;terrified. Sure that this was it. Sure that he was going to die there. And even though he\u2019d been with Mr. Stark, he\u2019d still be so afraid. Until the man had started talking. Until Mr. Stark had calmed him down. Spoken to him in the dark. Promised him that it was okay. That Peter could do it&hellip;could get them out.</p><p>Peter could barely see the plane against the dark sky thanks to the panels that made it all but invisible, but with his enhanced vision he could just make out the edges. Lifting a webshooter to aim, he started to shoot a web, but jumped a bit when Mr. Stark bit out a curse&hellip;and then there was a bang and something ricocheted off of Mr. Stark\u2019s armor with a loud clang. Possibly a bullet. Peter couldn\u2019t tell, but his senses were going off, sending a cold chill up his spine.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Pete!\u201d The man swerved in the air but Peter felt his senses explode almost painfully, and he jumped, launching himself toward the plane and shooting a web just as the Vulture attacked.</p><p>\u201cKid!\u201d Mr. Stark screamed, swerving in the air and twisting around to face the Vulture, but Peter was too busy shooting a web at the plane and swinging around, gripping the outside as best as he could. There was no way the man would be able to hear him without comms, so he climbed around the side of the plane, gripping it for dear life and shivering as it shot through the air. He could just vaguely make out the sounds of a shouted conversation&hellip;of blasts and repulsors. Gripping the plane and moving slowly, body almost flat against the metal, he managed to climb around the side and catch a glimpse of them. Mr. Stark was shooting at the Vulture who swung around him, shooting back with some kind of alien weapon. And Peter felt absolutely useless on the sidelines.</p><p>Taking aim, he managed to shoot a web at the Vulture\u2019s wing, yanking hard, and the man whirled around, a wing slicing through the webbing and shooting a blast at him&hellip;a blast from the alien weapon that he managed to duck away from just in time. It missed him&hellip;and hit the front of the plane.</p><p>And then it was losing altitude! Peter gasped, gripping the outside of the plane as it began to descend, speeding up until his fingers ached from holding on. The plane was going down. Fast. He could vaguely hear Mr. Stark yelling for him, but then the Vulture was after him again, the Iron Man suit and the Vulture twirling around the sky like dancers, stray blasts from repulsors and whatever alien weapon the Vulture had filling the air around the plane, and Peter crawled toward the wing, a desperate idea taking root.</p><p>Mr. Stark was busy with the Vulture and the plane was going to crash&hellip;but Peter couldn\u2019t let it hit a populated area&hellip;he couldn\u2019t let people die because of this&hellip;because of him. So he scrambled toward the wing, fingers slipping several times&hellip;would Mr. Stark be able to catch him if he fell? Would he get there in time? Peter tried to shove that thought away. He didn\u2019t have time for a thought like that. Shooting a web at the wing and gripping the plane as tightly as he could, he pulled. Down below them, he could just make out the lights and roller coasters of Coney Island. There was a beach there&hellip;not a big one, but big enough to bring the plane down. There shouldn\u2019t be any civilians at that time of night. He pulled harder, screaming when his ribs shifted and the air whipped around him. It was too heavy! Too big! He was too hurt! He couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>But he\u2019d lifted a building off of himself and Mr. Stark less than an hour ago. He\u2019d saved the both of them. Without the suit. And hadn\u2019t Mr. Stark told him that he was Spiderman with or without it?</p><p>Peter pulled, and then the plane was turning. Peter gripped the webs as hard as he could, pulling, pulling, pulling. Pulling and leaning all the way back and the plane was turning toward the beach, hurtling toward the ground. Behind him, he could hear Mr. Stark and the Vulture fighting, and maybe Mr. Stark screaming&hellip;but he couldn\u2019t be sure. Couldn\u2019t make out much over the whine of the engine and the wind that whipped around him, and the ground was getting closer and closer.</p><p>The ground was getting closer and closer.</p><p>His parents had died in a plane crash.</p><p>Closing his eyes and gripping the wing of the plane, he braced himself, jaw clenched tight, teeth pressed too tightly together. They weren\u2019t going to hit anyone! He\u2019d done it! He\u2019d\u2026</p><p>Shaking. Rumbling. The sounds of metal breaking and twisting, and something exploding. A jolt. He couldn\u2019t control his body, where it was going or flying or&hellip;</p><p>Ringing.</p><p>There was ringing in his ears and his whole body hurt and&hellip;all he could hear was the ringing. Constant, high pitched, blocking out every other sound. He managed to peel his eyes open after a moment, his body too heavy to move. All around him was fire. And boxes. Boxes and crates scattered on the ground and his head swam when he went to move, everything swirling around him, the ringing in his ears kicking up a notch.</p><p>He might have groaned&hellip;might have cried out. But he couldn&rsquo;t hear. Slowly, he became aware of more&hellip;of pain and the smell of fire and blood and faintly, he could hear something familiar. A roar of noise&hellip;footsteps, then a voice that sounded a thousand miles away.</p><p>\u201cKid? Come on, kiddo&hellip;come on!\u201d A hand touched his side and he gasped in pain. \u201cCome on Underoos. Look at me.\u201d A hand on his shoulder tugged gently and he rolled over, reaching up and yanked his mask off as he sat up, head still swimming. \u201cEasy, kid, easy. You just crashed a plane\u2026\u201d. The man trailed off, voice full of something like wonder. Mr. Stark. Iron Man. But&hellip;if Mr. Stark was with him&hellip;it didn\u2019t make sense. It felt like he was swaying&hellip;maybe he was because in the next moment a firm hand gripped his shoulder and steadied him.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t&hellip;it was the only&hellip;I didn\u2019t know how\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey&hellip;don\u2019t be sorry, Pete. That was good, kid. No one else got hurt&hellip;it was a good idea.\u201d A hand brushed his hair back and Peter closed his eyes, chin bobbing for a moment before he was able to snap himself awake. \u201cYou with me, buddy?\u201d He nodded, wiping a hand over his face and pressing it to his temple.</p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;yeah\u201d. Peter muttered. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d He said, barely aware of his own words. His mouth seemed to be moving on its own. He always told Mr. Stark that he was okay. He had to be, right?</p><p>\u201cYeah, you look it.\u201d Mr. Stark chuckled, the sound still worried but also somehow fond.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Toomes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, you were just in a plane crash! I don\u2019t give a shit where Toomes is.\u201d Peter started to shake his head, but the movement hurt too much so he went still, a hand pressed to his temple.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let him get your stuff\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Pete. Just take a second.\u201d The hand was firm on his shoulder, holding him upright. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d He gave a shaky nod. Mr. Stark looked him in the eye for a long time, then stood and, taking the offered hand, Peter let the man pull him up. For a moment, he swayed, gripping Mr. Stark\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cPete? Hey, let\u2019s get you somewhere you can sit. You need to rest, and then I\u2019m going to get you to a doctor, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve gotta get&hellip;get\u2026\u201d. Peter trailed off, eyes widening as a shadow fell over them, and Peter shoved Mr. Stark backward, the two of them landing in a heap, a blast hitting the ground in the spot where they\u2019d been standing.</p><p>Peter groaned, swearing under his breath when his whole body gave an angry throb in protest. But the Vulture was still there and they still had to take him down before he got his hands on any of Mr. Stark\u2019s stuff. They couldn\u2019t let him get away again!</p><p>Jumping back up, Peter shot a web at the Vulture as Mr. Stark launched himself in the air. Peter managed to catch him in the foot with a web, then jumped, pulling as hard as he could, trying to hold him still for a moment. Mr. Stark shot around the side, shooting at the Vulture with his repulsors, aiming for the wingsuit while Peter dodged a stray blast&hellip;or maybe it was a bullet. His brain wasn\u2019t quite responding. Still, he held the man, shooting another web to make sure. With Peter holding him still for a moment, Mr, Stark managed to damage his wings enough that the man was sent plummeting to the ground.</p><p>Toward the fire.</p><p>If he landed in that fire, his suit might explode. He would die.</p><p>Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion&hellip;so very far away. Peter felt like he was struggling to keep up. To figure out what was happening. There had been a plane and the beach\u2026his head swam like it was full of water. Had he been in the water? Either way, Mr. Toomes was falling. Plummeting. Towards the fire.</p><p>Peter raced forward, jumping onto one off the crates and leaping, arms outstretched. Wrapping his arms around Mr. Toomes, barely avoiding the razor-sharp edges, he landed hard, holding the man tight. All around them was fire, and Peter could barely breathe with all the smoke, but he had to get them out. Picking a direction that he was pretty sure would lead them out of the fire, he stumbled forward. He was moving on autopilot, gasping for air but trying not to breathe too deeply and hurt his ribs any more&hellip;they already hurt so bad. And catching the Vulture had only made them hurt more.</p><p>Mr. Stark met him as soon as he was out of the flames, grabbing his shoulder and leading him away from the fire. Peter stumbled forward, carrying Mr. Toomes over to the sand and dropping him carefully on the ground. Staggering a little and pressing a hand into his side, he let Mr. Stark grab his arm, holding him upright for a moment before turning to Toomes.</p><p>Mr. Stark knelt beside the man, wrestling him out of the wingsuit and discarding the scrapped metal on the beach. Not wanting to disturb him, Peter looked around for his mask on the dark beach, the only light coming from far off carnival booths and the fire that was consuming parts of the plane. \u201cMr. Stark\u2026\u201d. He spun around, searching for his mask, and then he was sitting down hard on the sand, tripping over his own feet and letting his eyes close for a second.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Hey, kid&hellip;look at me.\u201d The order somehow cut through the fog and the ever-present ringing in his ears, and he managed to meet Mr. Stark\u2019s eyes for a moment. The man wasn\u2019t in the suit&hellip;had he taken it off? \u201cI called Happy. He\u2019s on his way, bud. It won\u2019t be long&hellip;just try to stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark&hellip;I don\u2019t&hellip;don\u2019t feel so good\u2026\u201d. He admitted, and the man gripped his arm, the world spinning around him in a blur. \u201cI don\u2019t&hellip;don\u2019t feel\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay. Just hold on a\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t remember closing his eyes&hellip;didn\u2019t remember dropping forward into Mr. Stark\u2019s arms. But the next thing he knew, he was laying on something that was moving, his head resting in someone\u2019s lap. His whole body felt like it was made of lead&hellip;or something heavier. He gasped for air, flinching when that upset his ribs. He pressed his hand to his side, taking a much shallower breath, and this time a hand ran through his hair. \u201cPete? You with me, kid?\u201d Mr. Stark asked, his voice on the verge of panic.</p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;yeah, I\u2019m&hellip;I\u2019m good.\u201d He muttered, wondering why talking was suddenly so hard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said last time, about five minutes before you passed out on me, so forgive me if I don\u2019t take your word for it.\u201d The hand remained on his head though, fingers combing his dusty, filthy hair back. He peeled his eyes open and stared at the roof of a car, then at Mr. Stark who was bleeding from a cut over his temple and another on his cheek. \u201cStay put until we get back to the Compound, okay? I\u2019ve got Doctor Cho at the compound. She\u2019s going to take a look at you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor\u2026\u201d. He muttered, trying to understand. Mr. Stark was talking so fast. Did he always talk so fast?</p><p>\u201cYou saved my ass, kiddo, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrowed his brow. That didn\u2019t sound right. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that figured out who he was. You\u2019re the one that went after him. Lifted a building off of us. Saved countless people from a plane crash by crashing it yourself. Saved Toomes when he would have burned to death. So you didn\u2019t just save my ass, kid. You&hellip;you did good Pete. You did great.\u201d Those fingers kept trailing through his hair, his other hand squeezing Peter\u2019s shoulder, his grip gentle. \u201cYou did great, Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>Peter closed his eyes, turning a little so that the pressure was off his ribs, and made himself comfortable in Mr. Stark\u2019s lap, too out of it to be embarrassed when the man gave a soft, worried chuckle.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>People who wanted to be on my Taglist: \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\" target=\"_blank\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYefR0_noqWeV64SHJ6n-2Q\" target=\"_blank\">@lerums</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHM6tx_YEA7pGpDkZj3p1-A\" target=\"_blank\">@bla-369</a> @<a href=\"http://softiea.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">softiea</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmgN1rgIp_KvKoUYwGqIU7A\" target=\"_blank\">@percyjacksonconfessional</a>\u200b @<a href=\"http://noot-scamoonder.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">noot-scamoonder</a> @<a href=\"https://tinyfries.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tinyfries</a> \u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfl4GDRjCWJo1QMLP1fz_AA\" target=\"_blank\">@marvel-us-world</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnZtuj111LQ9z2-Absnsydw\" target=\"_blank\">@anyonewantathroatsweet</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5FUb1Hdo_oaOX1P6U2YLjg\" target=\"_blank\">@movieobsessed0914</a> @dreamthroughthemonotony @<a href=\"http://skyelight13.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">skyelight13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFpKEq4u2l_AOzP_P2_feDQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessjesstotherescue</a> @<a href=\"http://scaredhuman88.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">scaredhuman88</a> @<a href=\"http://tikamoinzeb.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tikamoinzeb</a> @<a href=\"http://catsandcoffee-x.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">catsandcoffee-x</a> @<a href=\"http://i-n-s-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i-n-s-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n</a> @<a href=\"http://wicked-starlight-collector.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">wicked-starlight-collector</a> @<a href=\"http://my-babies-are-ash.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">my-babies-are-ash</a> @<a href=\"http://doodlerooniee.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">doodlerooniee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV-p0UxitmMu_T_mAu1tb-A\" target=\"_blank\">@ill-take-tea-for-200-alex</a> @roswin <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGPmMFLkvKNQJwBzE5q0UrA\" target=\"_blank\">@ourjourneysideways</a> @<a href=\"https://ironicspider.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ronicspider</a> @<a href=\"http://peuty.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">peuty</a> @<a href=\"http://peter-parkerstark.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">peter-parkerstark</a> @<a href=\"http://just-the-daydreamer.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">just-the-daydreamer</a> @<a href=\"https://dreamrelationships123.tumblr.com/post/185302547852/tiny-penny-parker-au-stories-in-order\" target=\"_blank\">dreamrelationships123</a></b></p><p><b>If you want to be on my Taglist, let me know!!</b></p>",

The plan was a little\u2026well\u2026nonexistent really. They had just agreed to find the plane and stop the Vulture. He\u2019d called Happy to give him some warning, but there wasn\u2019t much Happy could do. Still, Peter was getting the chance to fight with Iron Man! Some part of him, the part that wasn\u2019t just a little terrified, was thrilled.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He hadn\u2019t expected Mr. Stark to show up at the warehouse. Not at all. Honestly, he hadn\u2019t thought that Ned would be able to get through to him since he doubted Mr. Stark answered calls from random numbers. But then he\u2019d turned around, right as he\u2019d heard a ruble from above his head, and Iron Man had been there, reaching out an arm\u2026and then they\u2019d both been buried under the rubble.</p><p>When he\u2019d come to\u2026only seconds, it had seemed, after the collapse, he\u2019d heard Mr. Stark yelling for him. Sounding afraid. Worried. The same way he\u2019d sounded when he had reached out for Peter\u2026when Mr. Toomes had made the whole thing fall. He\u2019d been so afraid\u2026terrified. Sure that this was it. Sure that he was going to die there. And even though he\u2019d been with Mr. Stark, he\u2019d still be so afraid. Until the man had started talking. Until Mr. Stark had calmed him down. Spoken to him in the dark. Promised him that it was okay. That Peter could do it\u2026could get them out.</p><p>Peter could barely see the plane against the dark sky thanks to the panels that made it all but invisible, but with his enhanced vision he could just make out the edges. Lifting a webshooter to aim, he started to shoot a web, but jumped a bit when Mr. Stark bit out a curse\u2026and then there was a bang and something ricocheted off of Mr. Stark\u2019s armor with a loud clang. Possibly a bullet. Peter couldn\u2019t tell, but his senses were going off, sending a cold chill up his spine.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Pete!\u201d The man swerved in the air but Peter felt his senses explode almost painfully, and he jumped, launching himself toward the plane and shooting a web just as the Vulture attacked.</p><p>\u201cKid!\u201d Mr. Stark screamed, swerving in the air and twisting around to face the Vulture, but Peter was too busy shooting a web at the plane and swinging around, gripping the outside as best as he could. There was no way the man would be able to hear him without comms, so he climbed around the side of the plane, gripping it for dear life and shivering as it shot through the air. He could just vaguely make out the sounds of a shouted conversation\u2026of blasts and repulsors. Gripping the plane and moving slowly, body almost flat against the metal, he managed to climb around the side and catch a glimpse of them. Mr. Stark was shooting at the Vulture who swung around him, shooting back with some kind of alien weapon. And Peter felt absolutely useless on the sidelines.</p><p>Taking aim, he managed to shoot a web at the Vulture\u2019s wing, yanking hard, and the man whirled around, a wing slicing through the webbing and shooting a blast at him\u2026a blast from the alien weapon that he managed to duck away from just in time. It missed him\u2026and hit the front of the plane.</p><p>And then it was losing altitude! Peter gasped, gripping the outside of the plane as it began to descend, speeding up until his fingers ached from holding on. The plane was going down. Fast. He could vaguely hear Mr. Stark yelling for him, but then the Vulture was after him again, the Iron Man suit and the Vulture twirling around the sky like dancers, stray blasts from repulsors and whatever alien weapon the Vulture had filling the air around the plane, and Peter crawled toward the wing, a desperate idea taking root.</p><p>Mr. Stark was busy with the Vulture and the plane was going to crash\u2026but Peter couldn\u2019t let it hit a populated area\u2026he couldn\u2019t let people die because of this\u2026because of him. So he scrambled toward the wing, fingers slipping several times\u2026would Mr. Stark be able to catch him if he fell? Would he get there in time? Peter tried to shove that thought away. He didn\u2019t have time for a thought like that. Shooting a web at the wing and gripping the plane as tightly as he could, he pulled. Down below them, he could just make out the lights and roller coasters of Coney Island. There was a beach there\u2026not a big one, but big enough to bring the plane down. There shouldn\u2019t be any civilians at that time of night. He pulled harder, screaming when his ribs shifted and the air whipped around him. It was too heavy! Too big! He was too hurt! He couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>But he\u2019d lifted a building off of himself and Mr. Stark less than an hour ago. He\u2019d saved the both of them. Without the suit. And hadn\u2019t Mr. Stark told him that he was Spiderman with or without it?</p><p>Peter pulled, and then the plane was turning. Peter gripped the webs as hard as he could, pulling, pulling, pulling. Pulling and leaning all the way back and the plane was turning toward the beach, hurtling toward the ground. Behind him, he could hear Mr. Stark and the Vulture fighting, and maybe Mr. Stark screaming\u2026but he couldn\u2019t be sure. Couldn\u2019t make out much over the whine of the engine and the wind that whipped around him, and the ground was getting closer and closer.</p><p>The ground was getting closer and closer.</p><p>His parents had died in a plane crash.</p><p>Closing his eyes and gripping the wing of the plane, he braced himself, jaw clenched tight, teeth pressed too tightly together. They weren\u2019t going to hit anyone! He\u2019d done it! He\u2019d\u2026</p><p>Shaking. Rumbling. The sounds of metal breaking and twisting, and something exploding. A jolt. He couldn\u2019t control his body, where it was going or flying or\u2026</p><p>Ringing.</p><p>There was ringing in his ears and his whole body hurt and\u2026all he could hear was the ringing. Constant, high pitched, blocking out every other sound. He managed to peel his eyes open after a moment, his body too heavy to move. All around him was fire. And boxes. Boxes and crates scattered on the ground and his head swam when he went to move, everything swirling around him, the ringing in his ears kicking up a notch.</p><p>He might have groaned\u2026might have cried out. But he couldn\u2019t hear. Slowly, he became aware of more\u2026of pain and the smell of fire and blood and faintly, he could hear something familiar. A roar of noise\u2026footsteps, then a voice that sounded a thousand miles away.</p><p>\u201cKid? Come on, kiddo\u2026come on!\u201d A hand touched his side and he gasped in pain. \u201cCome on Underoos. Look at me.\u201d A hand on his shoulder tugged gently and he rolled over, reaching up and yanked his mask off as he sat up, head still swimming. \u201cEasy, kid, easy. You just crashed a plane\u2026\u201d. The man trailed off, voice full of something like wonder. Mr. Stark. Iron Man. But\u2026if Mr. Stark was with him\u2026it didn\u2019t make sense. It felt like he was swaying\u2026maybe he was because in the next moment a firm hand gripped his shoulder and steadied him.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026it was the only\u2026I didn\u2019t know how\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey\u2026don\u2019t be sorry, Pete. That was good, kid. No one else got hurt\u2026it was a good idea.\u201d A hand brushed his hair back and Peter closed his eyes, chin bobbing for a moment before he was able to snap himself awake. \u201cYou with me, buddy?\u201d He nodded, wiping a hand over his face and pressing it to his temple.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026yeah\u201d. Peter muttered. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d He said, barely aware of his own words. His mouth seemed to be moving on its own. He always told Mr. Stark that he was okay. He had to be, right?</p><p>\u201cYeah, you look it.\u201d Mr. Stark chuckled, the sound still worried but also somehow fond.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Toomes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, you were just in a plane crash! I don\u2019t give a shit where Toomes is.\u201d Peter started to shake his head, but the movement hurt too much so he went still, a hand pressed to his temple.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let him get your stuff\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Pete. Just take a second.\u201d The hand was firm on his shoulder, holding him upright. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d He gave a shaky nod. Mr. Stark looked him in the eye for a long time, then stood and, taking the offered hand, Peter let the man pull him up. For a moment, he swayed, gripping Mr. Stark\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cPete? Hey, let\u2019s get you somewhere you can sit. You need to rest, and then I\u2019m going to get you to a doctor, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve gotta get\u2026get\u2026\u201d. Peter trailed off, eyes widening as a shadow fell over them, and Peter shoved Mr. Stark backward, the two of them landing in a heap, a blast hitting the ground in the spot where they\u2019d been standing.</p><p>Peter groaned, swearing under his breath when his whole body gave an angry throb in protest. But the Vulture was still there and they still had to take him down before he got his hands on any of Mr. Stark\u2019s stuff. They couldn\u2019t let him get away again!</p><p>Jumping back up, Peter shot a web at the Vulture as Mr. Stark launched himself in the air. Peter managed to catch him in the foot with a web, then jumped, pulling as hard as he could, trying to hold him still for a moment. Mr. Stark shot around the side, shooting at the Vulture with his repulsors, aiming for the wingsuit while Peter dodged a stray blast\u2026or maybe it was a bullet. His brain wasn\u2019t quite responding. Still, he held the man, shooting another web to make sure. With Peter holding him still for a moment, Mr, Stark managed to damage his wings enough that the man was sent plummeting to the ground.</p><p>Toward the fire.</p><p>If he landed in that fire, his suit might explode. He would die.</p><p>Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion\u2026so very far away. Peter felt like he was struggling to keep up. To figure out what was happening. There had been a plane and the beach\u2026his head swam like it was full of water. Had he been in the water? Either way, Mr. Toomes was falling. Plummeting. Towards the fire.</p><p>Peter raced forward, jumping onto one off the crates and leaping, arms outstretched. Wrapping his arms around Mr. Toomes, barely avoiding the razor-sharp edges, he landed hard, holding the man tight. All around them was fire, and Peter could barely breathe with all the smoke, but he had to get them out. Picking a direction that he was pretty sure would lead them out of the fire, he stumbled forward. He was moving on autopilot, gasping for air but trying not to breathe too deeply and hurt his ribs any more\u2026they already hurt so bad. And catching the Vulture had only made them hurt more.</p><p>Mr. Stark met him as soon as he was out of the flames, grabbing his shoulder and leading him away from the fire. Peter stumbled forward, carrying Mr. Toomes over to the sand and dropping him carefully on the ground. Staggering a little and pressing a hand into his side, he let Mr. Stark grab his arm, holding him upright for a moment before turning to Toomes.</p><p>Mr. Stark knelt beside the man, wrestling him out of the wingsuit and discarding the scrapped metal on the beach. Not wanting to disturb him, Peter looked around for his mask on the dark beach, the only light coming from far off carnival booths and the fire that was consuming parts of the plane. \u201cMr. Stark\u2026\u201d. He spun around, searching for his mask, and then he was sitting down hard on the sand, tripping over his own feet and letting his eyes close for a second.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Hey, kid\u2026look at me.\u201d The order somehow cut through the fog and the ever-present ringing in his ears, and he managed to meet Mr. Stark\u2019s eyes for a moment. The man wasn\u2019t in the suit\u2026had he taken it off? \u201cI called Happy. He\u2019s on his way, bud. It won\u2019t be long\u2026just try to stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t feel so good\u2026\u201d. He admitted, and the man gripped his arm, the world spinning around him in a blur. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t feel\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay. Just hold on a\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t remember closing his eyes\u2026didn\u2019t remember dropping forward into Mr. Stark\u2019s arms. But the next thing he knew, he was laying on something that was moving, his head resting in someone\u2019s lap. His whole body felt like it was made of lead\u2026or something heavier. He gasped for air, flinching when that upset his ribs. He pressed his hand to his side, taking a much shallower breath, and this time a hand ran through his hair. \u201cPete? You with me, kid?\u201d Mr. Stark asked, his voice on the verge of panic.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m good.\u201d He muttered, wondering why talking was suddenly so hard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said last time, about five minutes before you passed out on me, so forgive me if I don\u2019t take your word for it.\u201d The hand remained on his head though, fingers combing his dusty, filthy hair back. He peeled his eyes open and stared at the roof of a car, then at Mr. Stark who was bleeding from a cut over his temple and another on his cheek. \u201cStay put until we get back to the Compound, okay? I\u2019ve got Doctor Cho at the compound. She\u2019s going to take a look at you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor\u2026\u201d. He muttered, trying to understand. Mr. Stark was talking so fast. Did he always talk so fast?</p><p>\u201cYou saved my ass, kiddo, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrowed his brow. That didn\u2019t sound right. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that figured out who he was. You\u2019re the one that went after him. Lifted a building off of us. Saved countless people from a plane crash by crashing it yourself. Saved Toomes when he would have burned to death. So you didn\u2019t just save my ass, kid. You\u2026you did good Pete. You did great.\u201d Those fingers kept trailing through his hair, his other hand squeezing Peter\u2019s shoulder, his grip gentle. \u201cYou did great, Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>Peter closed his eyes, turning a little so that the pressure was off his ribs, and made himself comfortable in Mr. Stark\u2019s lap, too out of it to be embarrassed when the man gave a soft, worried chuckle.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>People who wanted to be on my Taglist: \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\" target=\"_blank\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYefR0_noqWeV64SHJ6n-2Q\" target=\"_blank\">@lerums</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHM6tx_YEA7pGpDkZj3p1-A\" target=\"_blank\">@bla-369</a> @<a href=\"http://softiea.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">softiea</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmgN1rgIp_KvKoUYwGqIU7A\" target=\"_blank\">@percyjacksonconfessional</a>\u200b @<a href=\"http://noot-scamoonder.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">noot-scamoonder</a> @<a href=\"https://tinyfries.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tinyfries</a> \u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfl4GDRjCWJo1QMLP1fz_AA\" target=\"_blank\">@marvel-us-world</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnZtuj111LQ9z2-Absnsydw\" target=\"_blank\">@anyonewantathroatsweet</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5FUb1Hdo_oaOX1P6U2YLjg\" target=\"_blank\">@movieobsessed0914</a> @dreamthroughthemonotony @<a href=\"http://skyelight13.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">skyelight13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFpKEq4u2l_AOzP_P2_feDQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessjesstotherescue</a> @<a href=\"http://scaredhuman88.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">scaredhuman88</a> @<a href=\"http://tikamoinzeb.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tikamoinzeb</a> @<a href=\"http://catsandcoffee-x.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">catsandcoffee-x</a> @<a href=\"http://i-n-s-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i-n-s-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n</a> @<a href=\"http://wicked-starlight-collector.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">wicked-starlight-collector</a> @<a href=\"http://my-babies-are-ash.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">my-babies-are-ash</a> @<a href=\"http://doodlerooniee.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">doodlerooniee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV-p0UxitmMu_T_mAu1tb-A\" target=\"_blank\">@ill-take-tea-for-200-alex</a> @roswin <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGPmMFLkvKNQJwBzE5q0UrA\" target=\"_blank\">@ourjourneysideways</a> @<a href=\"https://ironicspider.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ronicspider</a> @<a href=\"http://peuty.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">peuty</a> @<a href=\"http://peter-parkerstark.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">peter-parkerstark</a> @<a href=\"http://just-the-daydreamer.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">just-the-daydreamer</a> @<a href=\"https://dreamrelationships123.tumblr.com/post/185302547852/tiny-penny-parker-au-stories-in-order\" target=\"_blank\">dreamrelationships123</a></b></p><p><b>If you want to be on my Taglist, let me know!!</b></p></p>",

Spiderman and Iron Man vs the Vulture (and a plane)</i></b></p><p>Peter gripped the Iron Man suit, doing his best to ignore the aches and pains as he moved. His ribs were killing him, and he had a sneaking suspicion that one might be broken. At least one. He could tell that the little cuts and bruises were healing, but this old suit didn\u2019t connect to Karen so he couldn\u2019t see anything about his vitals or what possible injuries he might have. He figured he could lay down when this was all done\u2026sleep it off. He tried not to think of Liz\u2026tried not to think about the fact that he was about to fight her dad. Or the fact that he\u2019d left her at a Homecoming dance. Alone.</p><p>She probably hated him now.</p><p>\u201cYou good kid?\u201d Mr. Stark called, and Peter nodded before realizing that Mr. Stark couldn\u2019t see him, considering he was on the man\u2019s back, gripping the armor as Iron Man shot through the sky.</p><p>\u201cRight. Yeah. I\u2019m good.\u201d He nodded again, more out of habit than anything else, practically screaming his words.</p><p>It was getting colder the higher they went, and Peter shivered, losing his grip for just a second. \u201cPete?\u201d Mr. Stark called back to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d Peter explained, matching his tone, and Mr. Stark went quiet for a moment, but then the outside of the armor began to heat up. \u201cOh! Thanks!\u201d He yelled over the wind, cuddling a little closer. He felt more than heard the man chuckle, the armor shooting forward until they were close enough to see the plane in the distance.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Underoos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d He called, releasing him with one hand and lifting a webshooter to aim. The plan was a little\u2026well\u2026nonexistent really. They had just agreed to find the plane and stop the Vulture. He\u2019d called Happy to give him some warning, but there wasn\u2019t much Happy could do. Still, Peter was getting the chance to fight with Iron Man! Some part of him, the part that wasn\u2019t just a little terrified, was thrilled.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He hadn\u2019t expected Mr. Stark to show up at the warehouse. Not at all. Honestly, he hadn\u2019t thought that Ned would be able to get through to him since he doubted Mr. Stark answered calls from random numbers. But then he\u2019d turned around, right as he\u2019d heard a ruble from above his head, and Iron Man had been there, reaching out an arm\u2026and then they\u2019d both been buried under the rubble.</p><p>When he\u2019d come to\u2026only seconds, it had seemed, after the collapse, he\u2019d heard Mr. Stark yelling for him. Sounding afraid. Worried. The same way he\u2019d sounded when he had reached out for Peter\u2026when Mr. Toomes had made the whole thing fall. He\u2019d been so afraid\u2026terrified. Sure that this was it. Sure that he was going to die there. And even though he\u2019d been with Mr. Stark, he\u2019d still be so afraid. Until the man had started talking. Until Mr. Stark had calmed him down. Spoken to him in the dark. Promised him that it was okay. That Peter could do it\u2026could get them out.</p><p>Peter could barely see the plane against the dark sky thanks to the panels that made it all but invisible, but with his enhanced vision he could just make out the edges. Lifting a webshooter to aim, he started to shoot a web, but jumped a bit when Mr. Stark bit out a curse\u2026and then there was a bang and something ricocheted off of Mr. Stark\u2019s armor with a loud clang. Possibly a bullet. Peter couldn\u2019t tell, but his senses were going off, sending a cold chill up his spine.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Pete!\u201d The man swerved in the air but Peter felt his senses explode almost painfully, and he jumped, launching himself toward the plane and shooting a web just as the Vulture attacked.</p><p>\u201cKid!\u201d Mr. Stark screamed, swerving in the air and twisting around to face the Vulture, but Peter was too busy shooting a web at the plane and swinging around, gripping the outside as best as he could. There was no way the man would be able to hear him without comms, so he climbed around the side of the plane, gripping it for dear life and shivering as it shot through the air. He could just vaguely make out the sounds of a shouted conversation\u2026of blasts and repulsors. Gripping the plane and moving slowly, body almost flat against the metal, he managed to climb around the side and catch a glimpse of them. Mr. Stark was shooting at the Vulture who swung around him, shooting back with some kind of alien weapon. And Peter felt absolutely useless on the sidelines.</p><p>Taking aim, he managed to shoot a web at the Vulture\u2019s wing, yanking hard, and the man whirled around, a wing slicing through the webbing and shooting a blast at him\u2026a blast from the alien weapon that he managed to duck away from just in time. It missed him\u2026and hit the front of the plane.</p><p>And then it was losing altitude! Peter gasped, gripping the outside of the plane as it began to descend, speeding up until his fingers ached from holding on. The plane was going down. Fast. He could vaguely hear Mr. Stark yelling for him, but then the Vulture was after him again, the Iron Man suit and the Vulture twirling around the sky like dancers, stray blasts from repulsors and whatever alien weapon the Vulture had filling the air around the plane, and Peter crawled toward the wing, a desperate idea taking root.</p><p>Mr. Stark was busy with the Vulture and the plane was going to crash\u2026but Peter couldn\u2019t let it hit a populated area\u2026he couldn\u2019t let people die because of this\u2026because of him. So he scrambled toward the wing, fingers slipping several times\u2026would Mr. Stark be able to catch him if he fell? Would he get there in time? Peter tried to shove that thought away. He didn\u2019t have time for a thought like that. Shooting a web at the wing and gripping the plane as tightly as he could, he pulled. Down below them, he could just make out the lights and roller coasters of Coney Island. There was a beach there\u2026not a big one, but big enough to bring the plane down. There shouldn\u2019t be any civilians at that time of night. He pulled harder, screaming when his ribs shifted and the air whipped around him. It was too heavy! Too big! He was too hurt! He couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>But he\u2019d lifted a building off of himself and Mr. Stark less than an hour ago. He\u2019d saved the both of them. Without the suit. And hadn\u2019t Mr. Stark told him that he was Spiderman with or without it?</p><p>Peter pulled, and then the plane was turning. Peter gripped the webs as hard as he could, pulling, pulling, pulling. Pulling and leaning all the way back and the plane was turning toward the beach, hurtling toward the ground. Behind him, he could hear Mr. Stark and the Vulture fighting, and maybe Mr. Stark screaming\u2026but he couldn\u2019t be sure. Couldn\u2019t make out much over the whine of the engine and the wind that whipped around him, and the ground was getting closer and closer.</p><p>The ground was getting closer and closer.</p><p>His parents had died in a plane crash.</p><p>Closing his eyes and gripping the wing of the plane, he braced himself, jaw clenched tight, teeth pressed too tightly together. They weren\u2019t going to hit anyone! He\u2019d done it! He\u2019d\u2026</p><p>Shaking. Rumbling. The sounds of metal breaking and twisting, and something exploding. A jolt. He couldn\u2019t control his body, where it was going or flying or\u2026</p><p>Ringing.</p><p>There was ringing in his ears and his whole body hurt and\u2026all he could hear was the ringing. Constant, high pitched, blocking out every other sound. He managed to peel his eyes open after a moment, his body too heavy to move. All around him was fire. And boxes. Boxes and crates scattered on the ground and his head swam when he went to move, everything swirling around him, the ringing in his ears kicking up a notch.</p><p>He might have groaned\u2026might have cried out. But he couldn\u2019t hear. Slowly, he became aware of more\u2026of pain and the smell of fire and blood and faintly, he could hear something familiar. A roar of noise\u2026footsteps, then a voice that sounded a thousand miles away.</p><p>\u201cKid? Come on, kiddo\u2026come on!\u201d A hand touched his side and he gasped in pain. \u201cCome on Underoos. Look at me.\u201d A hand on his shoulder tugged gently and he rolled over, reaching up and yanked his mask off as he sat up, head still swimming. \u201cEasy, kid, easy. You just crashed a plane\u2026\u201d. The man trailed off, voice full of something like wonder. Mr. Stark. Iron Man. But\u2026if Mr. Stark was with him\u2026it didn\u2019t make sense. It felt like he was swaying\u2026maybe he was because in the next moment a firm hand gripped his shoulder and steadied him.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026it was the only\u2026I didn\u2019t know how\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey\u2026don\u2019t be sorry, Pete. That was good, kid. No one else got hurt\u2026it was a good idea.\u201d A hand brushed his hair back and Peter closed his eyes, chin bobbing for a moment before he was able to snap himself awake. \u201cYou with me, buddy?\u201d He nodded, wiping a hand over his face and pressing it to his temple.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026yeah\u201d. Peter muttered. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d He said, barely aware of his own words. His mouth seemed to be moving on its own. He always told Mr. Stark that he was okay. He had to be, right?</p><p>\u201cYeah, you look it.\u201d Mr. Stark chuckled, the sound still worried but also somehow fond.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Toomes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, you were just in a plane crash! I don\u2019t give a shit where Toomes is.\u201d Peter started to shake his head, but the movement hurt too much so he went still, a hand pressed to his temple.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let him get your stuff\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Pete. Just take a second.\u201d The hand was firm on his shoulder, holding him upright. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d He gave a shaky nod. Mr. Stark looked him in the eye for a long time, then stood and, taking the offered hand, Peter let the man pull him up. For a moment, he swayed, gripping Mr. Stark\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cPete? Hey, let\u2019s get you somewhere you can sit. You need to rest, and then I\u2019m going to get you to a doctor, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve gotta get\u2026get\u2026\u201d. Peter trailed off, eyes widening as a shadow fell over them, and Peter shoved Mr. Stark backward, the two of them landing in a heap, a blast hitting the ground in the spot where they\u2019d been standing.</p><p>Peter groaned, swearing under his breath when his whole body gave an angry throb in protest. But the Vulture was still there and they still had to take him down before he got his hands on any of Mr. Stark\u2019s stuff. They couldn\u2019t let him get away again!</p><p>Jumping back up, Peter shot a web at the Vulture as Mr. Stark launched himself in the air. Peter managed to catch him in the foot with a web, then jumped, pulling as hard as he could, trying to hold him still for a moment. Mr. Stark shot around the side, shooting at the Vulture with his repulsors, aiming for the wingsuit while Peter dodged a stray blast\u2026or maybe it was a bullet. His brain wasn\u2019t quite responding. Still, he held the man, shooting another web to make sure. With Peter holding him still for a moment, Mr, Stark managed to damage his wings enough that the man was sent plummeting to the ground.</p><p>Toward the fire.</p><p>If he landed in that fire, his suit might explode. He would die.</p><p>Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion\u2026so very far away. Peter felt like he was struggling to keep up. To figure out what was happening. There had been a plane and the beach\u2026his head swam like it was full of water. Had he been in the water? Either way, Mr. Toomes was falling. Plummeting. Towards the fire.</p><p>Peter raced forward, jumping onto one off the crates and leaping, arms outstretched. Wrapping his arms around Mr. Toomes, barely avoiding the razor-sharp edges, he landed hard, holding the man tight. All around them was fire, and Peter could barely breathe with all the smoke, but he had to get them out. Picking a direction that he was pretty sure would lead them out of the fire, he stumbled forward. He was moving on autopilot, gasping for air but trying not to breathe too deeply and hurt his ribs any more\u2026they already hurt so bad. And catching the Vulture had only made them hurt more.</p><p>Mr. Stark met him as soon as he was out of the flames, grabbing his shoulder and leading him away from the fire. Peter stumbled forward, carrying Mr. Toomes over to the sand and dropping him carefully on the ground. Staggering a little and pressing a hand into his side, he let Mr. Stark grab his arm, holding him upright for a moment before turning to Toomes.</p><p>Mr. Stark knelt beside the man, wrestling him out of the wingsuit and discarding the scrapped metal on the beach. Not wanting to disturb him, Peter looked around for his mask on the dark beach, the only light coming from far off carnival booths and the fire that was consuming parts of the plane. \u201cMr. Stark\u2026\u201d. He spun around, searching for his mask, and then he was sitting down hard on the sand, tripping over his own feet and letting his eyes close for a second.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Hey, kid\u2026look at me.\u201d The order somehow cut through the fog and the ever-present ringing in his ears, and he managed to meet Mr. Stark\u2019s eyes for a moment. The man wasn\u2019t in the suit\u2026had he taken it off? \u201cI called Happy. He\u2019s on his way, bud. It won\u2019t be long\u2026just try to stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t feel so good\u2026\u201d. He admitted, and the man gripped his arm, the world spinning around him in a blur. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t feel\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay. Just hold on a\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t remember closing his eyes\u2026didn\u2019t remember dropping forward into Mr. Stark\u2019s arms. But the next thing he knew, he was laying on something that was moving, his head resting in someone\u2019s lap. His whole body felt like it was made of lead\u2026or something heavier. He gasped for air, flinching when that upset his ribs. He pressed his hand to his side, taking a much shallower breath, and this time a hand ran through his hair. \u201cPete? You with me, kid?\u201d Mr. Stark asked, his voice on the verge of panic.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m good.\u201d He muttered, wondering why talking was suddenly so hard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said last time, about five minutes before you passed out on me, so forgive me if I don\u2019t take your word for it.\u201d The hand remained on his head though, fingers combing his dusty, filthy hair back. He peeled his eyes open and stared at the roof of a car, then at Mr. Stark who was bleeding from a cut over his temple and another on his cheek. \u201cStay put until we get back to the Compound, okay? I\u2019ve got Doctor Cho at the compound. She\u2019s going to take a look at you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor\u2026\u201d. He muttered, trying to understand. Mr. Stark was talking so fast. Did he always talk so fast?</p><p>\u201cYou saved my ass, kiddo, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrowed his brow. That didn\u2019t sound right. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that figured out who he was. You\u2019re the one that went after him. Lifted a building off of us. Saved countless people from a plane crash by crashing it yourself. Saved Toomes when he would have burned to death. So you didn\u2019t just save my ass, kid. You\u2026you did good Pete. You did great.\u201d Those fingers kept trailing through his hair, his other hand squeezing Peter\u2019s shoulder, his grip gentle. \u201cYou did great, Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>Peter closed his eyes, turning a little so that the pressure was off his ribs, and made himself comfortable in Mr. Stark\u2019s lap, too out of it to be embarrassed when the man gave a soft, worried chuckle.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>People who wanted to be on my Taglist: \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\" target=\"_blank\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYefR0_noqWeV64SHJ6n-2Q\" target=\"_blank\">@lerums</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHM6tx_YEA7pGpDkZj3p1-A\" target=\"_blank\">@bla-369</a> @<a href=\"http://softiea.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">softiea</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmgN1rgIp_KvKoUYwGqIU7A\" target=\"_blank\">@percyjacksonconfessional</a>\u200b @<a href=\"http://noot-scamoonder.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">noot-scamoonder</a> @<a href=\"https://tinyfries.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tinyfries</a> \u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfl4GDRjCWJo1QMLP1fz_AA\" target=\"_blank\">@marvel-us-world</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnZtuj111LQ9z2-Absnsydw\" target=\"_blank\">@anyonewantathroatsweet</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5FUb1Hdo_oaOX1P6U2YLjg\" target=\"_blank\">@movieobsessed0914</a> @dreamthroughthemonotony @<a href=\"http://skyelight13.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">skyelight13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFpKEq4u2l_AOzP_P2_feDQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessjesstotherescue</a> @<a href=\"http://scaredhuman88.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">scaredhuman88</a> @<a href=\"http://tikamoinzeb.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tikamoinzeb</a> @<a href=\"http://catsandcoffee-x.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">catsandcoffee-x</a> @<a href=\"http://i-n-s-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i-n-s-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n</a> @<a href=\"http://wicked-starlight-collector.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">wicked-starlight-collector</a> @<a href=\"http://my-babies-are-ash.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">my-babies-are-ash</a> @<a href=\"http://doodlerooniee.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">doodlerooniee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV-p0UxitmMu_T_mAu1tb-A\" target=\"_blank\">@ill-take-tea-for-200-alex</a> @roswin <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGPmMFLkvKNQJwBzE5q0UrA\" target=\"_blank\">@ourjourneysideways</a> @<a href=\"https://ironicspider.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ronicspider</a> @<a href=\"http://peuty.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">peuty</a> @<a href=\"http://peter-parkerstark.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">peter-parkerstark</a> @<a href=\"http://just-the-daydreamer.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">just-the-daydreamer</a> @<a href=\"https://dreamrelationships123.tumblr.com/post/185302547852/tiny-penny-parker-au-stories-in-order\" target=\"_blank\">dreamrelationships123</a></b></p><p><b>If you want to be on my Taglist, let me know!!</b></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2><b>A Quick Dip</b></h2><p><b><i>12. Spiderman and Iron Man vs the Vulture (and a plane)</i></b></p><p>Peter gripped the Iron Man suit, doing his best to ignore the aches and pains as he moved. His ribs were killing him, and he had a sneaking suspicion that one might be broken. At least one. He could tell that the little cuts and bruises were healing, but this old suit didn&rsquo;t connect to Karen so he couldn&rsquo;t see anything about his vitals or what possible injuries he might have. He figured he could lay down when this was all done&hellip;sleep it off. He tried not to think of Liz&hellip;tried not to think about the fact that he was about to fight her dad. Or the fact that he&rsquo;d left her at a Homecoming dance. Alone.</p><p>She probably hated him now.</p><p>&ldquo;You good kid?&rdquo; Mr. Stark called, and Peter nodded before realizing that Mr. Stark couldn&rsquo;t see him, considering he was on the man&rsquo;s back, gripping the armor as Iron Man shot through the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Right. Yeah. I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; He nodded again, more out of habit than anything else, practically screaming his words.</p><p>It was getting colder the higher they went, and Peter shivered, losing his grip for just a second. &ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; Mr. Stark called back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; Peter explained, matching his tone, and Mr. Stark went quiet for a moment, but then the outside of the armor began to heat up. &ldquo;Oh! Thanks!&rdquo; He yelled over the wind, cuddling a little closer. He felt more than heard the man chuckle, the armor shooting forward until they were close enough to see the plane in the distance.</p><p>&ldquo;You ready, Underoos?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; He called, releasing him with one hand and lifting a webshooter to aim. The plan was a little&hellip;well&hellip;nonexistent really. They had just agreed to find the plane and stop the Vulture. He&rsquo;d called Happy to give him some warning, but there wasn&rsquo;t much Happy could do. Still, Peter was getting the chance to fight with Iron Man! Some part of him, the part that wasn&rsquo;t just a little terrified, was thrilled.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t expected Mr. Stark to show up at the warehouse. Not at all. Honestly, he hadn&rsquo;t thought that Ned would be able to get through to him since he doubted Mr. Stark answered calls from random numbers. But then he&rsquo;d turned around, right as he&rsquo;d heard a ruble from above his head, and Iron Man had been there, reaching out an arm&hellip;and then they&rsquo;d both been buried under the rubble.</p><p>When he&rsquo;d come to&hellip;only seconds, it had seemed, after the collapse, he&rsquo;d heard Mr. Stark yelling for him. Sounding afraid. Worried. The same way he&rsquo;d sounded when he had reached out for Peter&hellip;when Mr. Toomes had made the whole thing fall. He&rsquo;d been so afraid&hellip;terrified. Sure that this was it. Sure that he was going to die there. And even though he&rsquo;d been with Mr. Stark, he&rsquo;d still be so afraid. Until the man had started talking. Until Mr. Stark had calmed him down. Spoken to him in the dark. Promised him that it was okay. That Peter could do it&hellip;could get them out.</p><p>Peter could barely see the plane against the dark sky thanks to the panels that made it all but invisible, but with his enhanced vision he could just make out the edges. Lifting a webshooter to aim, he started to shoot a web, but jumped a bit when Mr. Stark bit out a curse&hellip;and then there was a bang and something ricocheted off of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s armor with a loud clang. Possibly a bullet. Peter couldn&rsquo;t tell, but his senses were going off, sending a cold chill up his spine.</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on, Pete!&rdquo; The man swerved in the air but Peter felt his senses explode almost painfully, and he jumped, launching himself toward the plane and shooting a web just as the Vulture attacked.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid!&rdquo; Mr. Stark screamed, swerving in the air and twisting around to face the Vulture, but Peter was too busy shooting a web at the plane and swinging around, gripping the outside as best as he could. There was no way the man would be able to hear him without comms, so he climbed around the side of the plane, gripping it for dear life and shivering as it shot through the air. He could just vaguely make out the sounds of a shouted conversation&hellip;of blasts and repulsors. Gripping the plane and moving slowly, body almost flat against the metal, he managed to climb around the side and catch a glimpse of them. Mr. Stark was shooting at the Vulture who swung around him, shooting back with some kind of alien weapon. And Peter felt absolutely useless on the sidelines.</p><p>Taking aim, he managed to shoot a web at the Vulture&rsquo;s wing, yanking hard, and the man whirled around, a wing slicing through the webbing and shooting a blast at him&hellip;a blast from the alien weapon that he managed to duck away from just in time. It missed him&hellip;and hit the front of the plane.</p><p>And then it was losing altitude! Peter gasped, gripping the outside of the plane as it began to descend, speeding up until his fingers ached from holding on. The plane was going down. Fast. He could vaguely hear Mr. Stark yelling for him, but then the Vulture was after him again, the Iron Man suit and the Vulture twirling around the sky like dancers, stray blasts from repulsors and whatever alien weapon the Vulture had filling the air around the plane, and Peter crawled toward the wing, a desperate idea taking root.</p><p>Mr. Stark was busy with the Vulture and the plane was going to crash&hellip;but Peter couldn&rsquo;t let it hit a populated area&hellip;he couldn&rsquo;t let people die because of this&hellip;because of him. So he scrambled toward the wing, fingers slipping several times&hellip;would Mr. Stark be able to catch him if he fell? Would he get there in time? Peter tried to shove that thought away. He didn&rsquo;t have time for a thought like that. Shooting a web at the wing and gripping the plane as tightly as he could, he pulled. Down below them, he could just make out the lights and roller coasters of Coney Island. There was a beach there&hellip;not a big one, but big enough to bring the plane down. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any civilians at that time of night. He pulled harder, screaming when his ribs shifted and the air whipped around him. It was too heavy! Too big! He was too hurt! He couldn&rsquo;t do this.</p><p>But he&rsquo;d lifted a building off of himself and Mr. Stark less than an hour ago. He&rsquo;d saved the both of them. Without the suit. And hadn&rsquo;t Mr. Stark told him that he was Spiderman with or without it?</p><p>Peter pulled, and then the plane was turning. Peter gripped the webs as hard as he could, pulling, pulling, pulling. Pulling and leaning all the way back and the plane was turning toward the beach, hurtling toward the ground. Behind him, he could hear Mr. Stark and the Vulture fighting, and maybe Mr. Stark screaming&hellip;but he couldn&rsquo;t be sure. Couldn&rsquo;t make out much over the whine of the engine and the wind that whipped around him, and the ground was getting closer and closer.</p><p>The ground was getting closer and closer.</p><p>His parents had died in a plane crash.</p><p>Closing his eyes and gripping the wing of the plane, he braced himself, jaw clenched tight, teeth pressed too tightly together. They weren&rsquo;t going to hit anyone! He&rsquo;d done it! He&rsquo;d&hellip;</p><p>Shaking. Rumbling. The sounds of metal breaking and twisting, and something exploding. A jolt. He couldn&rsquo;t control his body, where it was going or flying or&hellip;</p><p>Ringing.</p><p>There was ringing in his ears and his whole body hurt and&hellip;all he could hear was the ringing. Constant, high pitched, blocking out every other sound. He managed to peel his eyes open after a moment, his body too heavy to move. All around him was fire. And boxes. Boxes and crates scattered on the ground and his head swam when he went to move, everything swirling around him, the ringing in his ears kicking up a notch.</p><p>He might have groaned&hellip;might have cried out. But he couldn&rsquo;t hear. Slowly, he became aware of more&hellip;of pain and the smell of fire and blood and faintly, he could hear something familiar. A roar of noise&hellip;footsteps, then a voice that sounded a thousand miles away.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid? Come on, kiddo&hellip;come on!&rdquo; A hand touched his side and he gasped in pain. &ldquo;Come on Underoos. Look at me.&rdquo; A hand on his shoulder tugged gently and he rolled over, reaching up and yanked his mask off as he sat up, head still swimming. &ldquo;Easy, kid, easy. You just crashed a plane&hellip;&rdquo;. The man trailed off, voice full of something like wonder. Mr. Stark. Iron Man. But&hellip;if Mr. Stark was with him&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t make sense. It felt like he was swaying&hellip;maybe he was because in the next moment a firm hand gripped his shoulder and steadied him.</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;it was the only&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t know how&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey&hellip;don&rsquo;t be sorry, Pete. That was good, kid. No one else got hurt&hellip;it was a good idea.&rdquo; A hand brushed his hair back and Peter closed his eyes, chin bobbing for a moment before he was able to snap himself awake. &ldquo;You with me, buddy?&rdquo; He nodded, wiping a hand over his face and pressing it to his temple.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;yeah&rdquo;. Peter muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; He said, barely aware of his own words. His mouth seemed to be moving on its own. He always told Mr. Stark that he was okay. He had to be, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you look it.&rdquo; Mr. Stark chuckled, the sound still worried but also somehow fond.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Toomes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you were just in a plane crash! I don&rsquo;t give a shit where Toomes is.&rdquo; Peter started to shake his head, but the movement hurt too much so he went still, a hand pressed to his temple.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let him get your stuff&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Easy, Pete. Just take a second.&rdquo; The hand was firm on his shoulder, holding him upright. &ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; He gave a shaky nod. Mr. Stark looked him in the eye for a long time, then stood and, taking the offered hand, Peter let the man pull him up. For a moment, he swayed, gripping Mr. Stark&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete? Hey, let&rsquo;s get you somewhere you can sit. You need to rest, and then I&rsquo;m going to get you to a doctor, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve gotta get&hellip;get&hellip;&rdquo;. Peter trailed off, eyes widening as a shadow fell over them, and Peter shoved Mr. Stark backward, the two of them landing in a heap, a blast hitting the ground in the spot where they&rsquo;d been standing.</p><p>Peter groaned, swearing under his breath when his whole body gave an angry throb in protest. But the Vulture was still there and they still had to take him down before he got his hands on any of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s stuff. They couldn&rsquo;t let him get away again!</p><p>Jumping back up, Peter shot a web at the Vulture as Mr. Stark launched himself in the air. Peter managed to catch him in the foot with a web, then jumped, pulling as hard as he could, trying to hold him still for a moment. Mr. Stark shot around the side, shooting at the Vulture with his repulsors, aiming for the wingsuit while Peter dodged a stray blast&hellip;or maybe it was a bullet. His brain wasn&rsquo;t quite responding. Still, he held the man, shooting another web to make sure. With Peter holding him still for a moment, Mr, Stark managed to damage his wings enough that the man was sent plummeting to the ground.</p><p>Toward the fire.</p><p>If he landed in that fire, his suit might explode. He would die.</p><p>Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion&hellip;so very far away. Peter felt like he was struggling to keep up. To figure out what was happening. There had been a plane and the beach&hellip;his head swam like it was full of water. Had he been in the water? Either way, Mr. Toomes was falling. Plummeting. Towards the fire.</p><p>Peter raced forward, jumping onto one off the crates and leaping, arms outstretched. Wrapping his arms around Mr. Toomes, barely avoiding the razor-sharp edges, he landed hard, holding the man tight. All around them was fire, and Peter could barely breathe with all the smoke, but he had to get them out. Picking a direction that he was pretty sure would lead them out of the fire, he stumbled forward. He was moving on autopilot, gasping for air but trying not to breathe too deeply and hurt his ribs any more&hellip;they already hurt so bad. And catching the Vulture had only made them hurt more.</p><p>Mr. Stark met him as soon as he was out of the flames, grabbing his shoulder and leading him away from the fire. Peter stumbled forward, carrying Mr. Toomes over to the sand and dropping him carefully on the ground. Staggering a little and pressing a hand into his side, he let Mr. Stark grab his arm, holding him upright for a moment before turning to Toomes.</p><p>Mr. Stark knelt beside the man, wrestling him out of the wingsuit and discarding the scrapped metal on the beach. Not wanting to disturb him, Peter looked around for his mask on the dark beach, the only light coming from far off carnival booths and the fire that was consuming parts of the plane. &ldquo;Mr. Stark&hellip;&rdquo;. He spun around, searching for his mask, and then he was sitting down hard on the sand, tripping over his own feet and letting his eyes close for a second.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter? Hey, kid&hellip;look at me.&rdquo; The order somehow cut through the fog and the ever-present ringing in his ears, and he managed to meet Mr. Stark&rsquo;s eyes for a moment. The man wasn&rsquo;t in the suit&hellip;had he taken it off? &ldquo;I called Happy. He&rsquo;s on his way, bud. It won&rsquo;t be long&hellip;just try to stay with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark&hellip;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;don&rsquo;t feel so good&hellip;&rdquo;. He admitted, and the man gripped his arm, the world spinning around him in a blur. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;don&rsquo;t feel&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay. Just hold on a&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t remember closing his eyes&hellip;didn&rsquo;t remember dropping forward into Mr. Stark&rsquo;s arms. But the next thing he knew, he was laying on something that was moving, his head resting in someone&rsquo;s lap. His whole body felt like it was made of lead&hellip;or something heavier. He gasped for air, flinching when that upset his ribs. He pressed his hand to his side, taking a much shallower breath, and this time a hand ran through his hair. &ldquo;Pete? You with me, kid?&rdquo; Mr. Stark asked, his voice on the verge of panic.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;yeah, I&rsquo;m&hellip;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; He muttered, wondering why talking was suddenly so hard.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you said last time, about five minutes before you passed out on me, so forgive me if I don&rsquo;t take your word for it.&rdquo; The hand remained on his head though, fingers combing his dusty, filthy hair back. He peeled his eyes open and stared at the roof of a car, then at Mr. Stark who was bleeding from a cut over his temple and another on his cheek. &ldquo;Stay put until we get back to the Compound, okay? I&rsquo;ve got Doctor Cho at the compound. She&rsquo;s going to take a look at you, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doctor&hellip;&rdquo;. He muttered, trying to understand. Mr. Stark was talking so fast. Did he always talk so fast?</p><p>&ldquo;You saved my ass, kiddo, you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter furrowed his brow. That didn&rsquo;t sound right. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one that got him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one that figured out who he was. You&rsquo;re the one that went after him.
