Let&rsquo;s check them out.</p><h2>Tongkat Ali</h2><p>This is an ingredient that is widely used in many male enhancement pills as it is believed to have a powerful sexual effect on men. Also known as Eurycoma longifolia, this herb is believed to boost the level of testosterone by up to 93 percent, as shown in individual studies.
