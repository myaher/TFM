Here we see Arya observing the man who is going to be her  very first &ldquo;kill&rdquo; as a novice of the HoBaW. Now what I find interesting here is how she desperately tries to come up with a valid reason about why she should be killing off this man. She tries to tell herself that the man is well past fifty and has lived long enough. She even thinks about how her father never got to live that long.

Now please keep in mind that I am only saying this in reference to what happened the last time she was disguised as the Cat of the canals. At that time the Ibbenese whalers treated her almost the same way as this man and yet she did not think about them twice. Another thing that I want to point out is that after a few lines from this paragraph we see her call the man &lsquo;evil&rsquo; based on his appearance. This is a direct contradiction to her character. Because Arya has never been the one to judge a person based on his/her outward appearance. In fact she has always tried to look at what lies beyond the surface. So I feel like Arya is deliberately trying to make herself believe that the man is evil. And it must be so because she fears that she is assassinating an innocent person. ( We even see her asking the Kindly Man if the Gods have judged this man! )</p><p>The concept of death has always been  traumatising to Arya. In fact she has nightmares about killing the stable boy, Dareon and the Tickler. So it strikes me odd that she should claim that the man will thank her for a gift from the Many faced. I think that Arya is feeling guilty here and is therefore trying to tell herself that she is not doing anything wrong. It is only after she hears about how the man is cheating the widows and the children of the unfortunate seafarers out of their insurance money that she finally devises a plan to kill him. </p><p><i>Cat understood.
