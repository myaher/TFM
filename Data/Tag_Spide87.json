I\u2019m kidding.\u201d Tony paused. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the corneas that crap out first.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d Peter yelped indignantly.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cStop teasing him, Tony.\u201d Pepper admonished with a grin of her own, as she walked back into the room. She stopped in front of them and held her phone up. \u201cI want another picture. Just for us and May.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMy corneas.\u201d Peter whine ended in a yelp with Pepper pinched him, teasingly. He laughed along with her, his shoulder\u2019s still locked with left over tension.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony would fix that.</p><p><br/></p><p>He dramatically pulled off his glasses and tossed them, clattering, onto the table. He turned and took Peter by the shoulders. It took every ounce of self control to school his face into a semblance of faux seriousness and not cave when Peter\u2019s blinked owlishly, surprised, up at him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou listen here, Parker.\u201d Tony said sternly, finger pointed at him. \u201cThis is the most important picture you\u2019ll ever take in your whole life. More important than graduation, wedding, or even your children\u2019s pictures.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter blinked again. Tony fought against the upward twitching of his lips, when Peter finally caught onto the joke and smiled, dopey up at him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis is going on your college recommendation letters, social media, May\u2019s fridge, my fridge-\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThe company newsletter.\u201d Pepper interjected and Tony gasped. He shook Peter\u2019s shoulders, inwardly grinning as Peter instantly went loose under his grasp. His neck bobbled with the motion, his head flopping comically around.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThe newsletter, Parker! The goddamn&rsquo;d newsletter!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter outright giggled at that and the sound burrowed straight into Tony\u2019s heart. Yeah, he was in way too deep with this kid. He grabbed the discarded sunglasses and slipped them back onto his face.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAll right, Parker.\u201d He said, running his hands over the shoulders of Peter\u2019s old hand-me-down jacket. The kid had refused any of the clothes Tony had offered him and he knew the second Peter had walked in wearing the slight too big jacket why.</p><p><br/></p><p>He licked his palm, ignored Peter\u2019s noise of disgust, and smoothed down the cowlick that stood to attention. He turned them aorund to face Pepper. He picked up the certificate and spun in over and over until Peter laughed, then put one side into the kid\u2019s hand. He was pretty sure it was upside down.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Tony said again, facing the camera. \u201cThis is it, Parker. I\u2019m serious. No funny faces, no throwing up gang signs, no emojis, no bunny ears.\u201d He lecutured, while moving his hand steadily up Peter\u2019s back, bunny ears at the ready. He felt Peter\u2019s hand do the same behind his back.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSmile, boys.\u201d Pepper instructed and Tony was about to until Peter stepped closer, pressing flush against his side.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony remembered the flash flood of second hand embarrassment when Peter had hugged him in the car after Germany. He\u2019d liked the kid, sure, but he didn\u2019t lie when he had said they weren\u2019t there yet. There weren\u2019t.</p><p><br/></p><p>That was months ago though. Now, after countless hours in the lab together, casual touches, meals shared, Tony supposed that they were there now. But it had honestly never occurred to him that there were until that moment.</p><p><br/></p><p>Pepper decided that right in the middle of his epiphany was the perfect time to snap the photo.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony shook himself out of his momentary stupor and patted Peter on the back, returning the kid\u2019s smile. He laid the certificate back on the table and walked over to Pepper. He couldn\u2019t help but notice the way her ring sparkled under the artificial lights as he wrapped his arms around her from behind. Peter mocked gagged in the background.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it turn out, Ms. Potts?\u201d He asked, already looking at it over her shoulder.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She answered and Tony had to agree. It was definitely a winner.</p><p><br/></p><p>They were both giving the other bunny ears. Peter was mugging, his face lit up in big dorky grin. And Tony, well, he could tell from the look on his face what had been going on in his head. That, somehow, he\u2019d let this bright, kind, scarily brilliant kid into his heart and he wasn\u2019t leaving it anytime soon.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d He murmured, grinning. \u201cThis is getting framed.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>And it had. And there was matching one sitting on the mantle of the Parker\u2019s living room. He knew because Peter had stuck it there, front and center the second Tony had given it to him.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony wondered, after the end of the world, after he failed miserably, if it was still sitting there or if May had turned it over in her grief.</p><p><br/></p><p>To say she hadn\u2019t taken the news well was a gross understatement. She\u2019d lost her child. Her son in everything but blood. Her baby.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony had expected the tears and heart wrenching sobs. And when she reached towards him, he\u2019d expected pounding fists and curses. Instead, she had wrapped him up in her arms. He and May had gotten closer over the past two years of him injecting himself in their lives. Close enough, that he squeezed her back tightly and cried along with her.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bring him back, Stark.\u201d She told him that that authoritative way that only Pepper Potts and May Parker seemed to have over him. The tone of voice that made him instinctively square his shoulders back.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He\u2019d promised and, now, as he flipped the framed photo of him and Peter repeatedly in his hands, it was a promise he intended to keep. No matter what.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d The knock on his office door made him look up. Steve stood in the threshold, watching him. He was dressed in the new red and white suit. His clear, blue eyes flickered down to the photo on Tony\u2019s lap then back to his face. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>The plan was the Avenger\u2019s last ditch effort. Their Hail Mary. Truly their last resort. If this didn\u2019t work, then nothing would.</p><p><br/></p><p>If they won, then they\u2019d get everything back. If they lost then, well, they didn\u2019t have much to lose to start with, but they\u2019d lose it all.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony took one last long look at the photo. He committed it to memory. He made himself remember every second, every single emotion he\u2019d felt that day. The way Peter smiled up at him. His solid weight under Tony\u2019s hands, letting himself get tossing around playfully because he trusted Tony. The feeling of rightness when he tucked himself into Tony\u2019s side.</p><p>The feeling of having a child, a son, in everything but blood. Of loving him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tony said, finally setting the picture done. He kept it face up, letting Peter Parker\u2019s youthful beaming face follow him out of the room. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He had a promise to keep.</p>",

He couldn\u2019t help but notice the way her ring sparkled under the artificial lights as he wrapped his arms around her from behind. Peter mocked gagged in the background.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it turn out, Ms. Potts?\u201d He asked, already looking at it over her shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She answered and Tony had to agree. It was definitely a winner.</p><p><br></p><p>They were both giving the other bunny ears. Peter was mugging, his face lit up in big dorky grin. And Tony, well, he could tell from the look on his face what had been going on in his head. That, somehow, he\u2019d let this bright, kind, scarily brilliant kid into his heart and he wasn\u2019t leaving it anytime soon.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d He murmured, grinning. \u201cThis is getting framed.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>And it had. And there was matching one sitting on the mantle of the Parker\u2019s living room. He knew because Peter had stuck it there, front and center the second Tony had given it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony wondered, after the end of the world, after he failed miserably, if it was still sitting there or if May had turned it over in her grief.</p><p><br></p><p>To say she hadn\u2019t taken the news well was a gross understatement. She\u2019d lost her child. Her son in everything but blood. Her baby.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony had expected the tears and heart wrenching sobs. And when she reached towards him, he\u2019d expected pounding fists and curses. Instead, she had wrapped him up in her arms. He and May had gotten closer over the past two years of him injecting himself in their lives. Close enough, that he squeezed her back tightly and cried along with her.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bring him back, Stark.\u201d She told him that that authoritative way that only Pepper Potts and May Parker seemed to have over him. The tone of voice that made him instinctively square his shoulders back.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He\u2019d promised and, now, as he flipped the framed photo of him and Peter repeatedly in his hands, it was a promise he intended to keep. No matter what.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d The knock on his office door made him look up. Steve stood in the threshold, watching him. He was dressed in the new red and white suit. His clear, blue eyes flickered down to the photo on Tony\u2019s lap then back to his face. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The plan was the Avenger\u2019s last ditch effort. Their Hail Mary. Truly their last resort. If this didn\u2019t work, then nothing would.</p><p><br></p><p>If they won, then they\u2019d get everything back. If they lost then, well, they didn\u2019t have much to lose to start with, but they\u2019d lose it all.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony took one last long look at the photo. He committed it to memory. He made himself remember every second, every single emotion he\u2019d felt that day. The way Peter smiled up at him. His solid weight under Tony\u2019s hands, letting himself get tossing around playfully because he trusted Tony. The feeling of rightness when he tucked himself into Tony\u2019s side.</p><p>The feeling of having a child, a son, in everything but blood. Of loving him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tony said, finally setting the picture done. He kept it face up, letting Peter Parker\u2019s youthful beaming face follow him out of the room. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He had a promise to keep.</p>",

Longer, really, if you counted his intern cover story. After the plane crash, the Vulture, and the rest of that nasty business, it fully occurred to Tony that his hands off mentoring style was not cutting it. His answer to that had been to move the kid in upstate and make him an Avenger.</p><p><br></p><p>That rejection had smarted, Tony wouldn\u2019t lie. But, after sitting on it, he decided that it hadn\u2019t been a rejection of him per se. So he took a calculated risk, returned the suit, and invited the kid to the compound to see the lab.</p><p><br></p><p>Their first lab session had been rocky, filled with awkward gaps of silences and stilled polite conversation. But the next one saw Peter make a breakthrough on a tricky problem on the side project that\u2019d been plaguing Tony for weeks and the rest was history.</p><p><br></p><p>Ironically, it had never occurred to Tony to make it an official position. By then, the every other weekends Peter spent at the compound was just for fun. He didn\u2019t associate it with SI business. Even May tagged along every once in a while.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Peter mentioned in passing he might have to cut down his time at the compound because he was looking for a job, then Tony complaining about it to Pepper in passing, and Pepper, bless her soul, reminding him that his beautiful, smart, fiancee, ran his company and could make Peter\u2019s internship a paid one, did it hit Tony that it was an option.</p><p><br></p><p>They had to run Peter through the ringer for it though. He\u2019d instantly have it if it was just up to Tony and Pepper, but he needed board approval and they were a tough nut to crack. Not to mention he had strong competition for the coveted spot.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning out, Tony hadn\u2019t even needed to worry about it. Peter breezed through the entry tests like it was a third grade math test and blew the board away with his project. Tony had stood right outside the conference room, grinning like an idiot, as the board practically pissed themselves in amazement.</p><p><br></p><p>The internship document signing ceremony was perhaps a tad over kill but it\u2019d been a tradition since his father ran the company and Tony would be lying if he said he didn\u2019t want to show Peter off to the press.</p><p><br></p><p>Cameras and crowds were not Peter Parker\u2019s thing, apparently, judging by the stiff smile and tense line his shoulders had taken on by the time Pepper shooed them all out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow you doing, kid?\u201d Tony asked, throwing an arm around the kid and discreetly kneading the tight muscle under his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Peter blinked around the room a few times. \u201cStill seeing stars.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony nodded. \u201cYou get used to that. Eventually all the flashes will just burn out your retinas.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cChill out, kid. I\u2019m kidding.\u201d Tony paused. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the corneas that crap out first.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d Peter yelped indignantly.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStop teasing him, Tony.\u201d Pepper admonished with a grin of her own, as she walked back into the room. She stopped in front of them and held her phone up. \u201cI want another picture. Just for us and May.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy corneas.\u201d Peter whine ended in a yelp with Pepper pinched him, teasingly. He laughed along with her, his shoulder\u2019s still locked with left over tension.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony would fix that.</p><p><br></p><p>He dramatically pulled off his glasses and tossed them, clattering, onto the table. He turned and took Peter by the shoulders. It took every ounce of self control to school his face into a semblance of faux seriousness and not cave when Peter\u2019s blinked owlishly, surprised, up at him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou listen here, Parker.\u201d Tony said sternly, finger pointed at him. \u201cThis is the most important picture you\u2019ll ever take in your whole life. More important than graduation, wedding, or even your children\u2019s pictures.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Peter blinked again. Tony fought against the upward twitching of his lips, when Peter finally caught onto the joke and smiled, dopey up at him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis is going on your college recommendation letters, social media, May\u2019s fridge, my fridge-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe company newsletter.\u201d Pepper interjected and Tony gasped. He shook Peter\u2019s shoulders, inwardly grinning as Peter instantly went loose under his grasp. His neck bobbled with the motion, his head flopping comically around.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe newsletter, Parker! The goddamn\u2019d newsletter!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Peter outright giggled at that and the sound burrowed straight into Tony\u2019s heart. Yeah, he was in way too deep with this kid. He grabbed the discarded sunglasses and slipped them back onto his face.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAll right, Parker.\u201d He said, running his hands over the shoulders of Peter\u2019s old hand-me-down jacket. The kid had refused any of the clothes Tony had offered him and he knew the second Peter had walked in wearing the slight too big jacket why.</p><p><br></p><p>He licked his palm, ignored Peter\u2019s noise of disgust, and smoothed down the cowlick that stood to attention. He turned them aorund to face Pepper. He picked up the certificate and spun in over and over until Peter laughed, then put one side into the kid\u2019s hand. He was pretty sure it was upside down.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Tony said again, facing the camera. \u201cThis is it, Parker. I\u2019m serious. No funny faces, no throwing up gang signs, no emojis, no bunny ears.\u201d He lecutured, while moving his hand steadily up Peter\u2019s back, bunny ears at the ready. He felt Peter\u2019s hand do the same behind his back.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSmile, boys.\u201d Pepper instructed and Tony was about to until Peter stepped closer, pressing flush against his side.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony remembered the flash flood of second hand embarrassment when Peter had hugged him in the car after Germany. He\u2019d liked the kid, sure, but he didn\u2019t lie when he had said they weren\u2019t there yet. There weren\u2019t.</p><p><br></p><p>That was months ago though.

No matter what.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; The knock on his office door made him look up. Steve stood in the threshold, watching him. He was dressed in the new red and white suit. His clear, blue eyes flickered down to the photo on Tony&rsquo;s lap then back to his face. &ldquo;You ready?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>The plan was the Avenger&rsquo;s last ditch effort. Their Hail Mary. Truly their last resort. If this didn&rsquo;t work, then nothing would.</p><p><br /></p><p>If they won, then they&rsquo;d get everything back. If they lost then, well, they didn&rsquo;t have much to lose to start with, but they&rsquo;d lose it all.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tony took one last long look at the photo. He committed it to memory. He made himself remember every second, every single emotion he&rsquo;d felt that day. The way Peter smiled up at him. His solid weight under Tony&rsquo;s hands, letting himself get tossing around playfully because he trusted Tony. The feeling of rightness when he tucked himself into Tony&rsquo;s side.</p><p>The feeling of having a child, a son, in everything but blood. Of loving him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Tony said, finally setting the picture done. He kept it face up, letting Peter Parker&rsquo;s youthful beaming face follow him out of the room. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>He had a promise to keep.</p>",
