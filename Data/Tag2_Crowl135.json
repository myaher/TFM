The man had\nbeen through Hell and back, lived through the resurrection of several close relatives,\nnot to mention that he, too, had met literal Gods. What miracle could he, a\ndemon, make happen that could be strong enough to \u2013 </p><p>He stopped\nhis train of thought when he realized he was already contemplating what they\nhad told him. That wasn\u2019t how this was supposed to go; he was supposed to\nrefuse all their offers and then go back to \u2013</p><p>\u201cSo be it,\nthen. If any of us were mortal\u201d and the middle one gives him an enigmatic smile\n\u201cI would tell you Good Luck, Crowley.\u201d</p><p>He blinked\nand found he was standing in the bunker. </p><p>Couldn\u2019t life\njust leave him alone?</p><p>The boys entered.\nCassie wasn\u2019t with them, but he was probably holed up in some room or other,\nbinging Netflix. </p><p>\u201cHello boys\u201d\nhe drawled. </p><p>They didn\u2019t\nreact. If course they couldn\u2019t see or hear him. Of bloody course. </p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t\nbe a ghost, Sammy\u201d Dean was saying, sounding exasperated. \u201cThis is not a ghost\u2019s\nMO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201c</p><p>He listened\nto their discussion and rolled his eyes. It was clearly a wraith. </p><p>Out of impulse,\nhe went to the library and grabbed a book about them, which he then threw on\nthe table. </p><p>They didn\u2019t\neven flinch, but a few seconds later Dean saw the book and assumed they had\njust left it lying there. </p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t\nfeel that he\u2019d get a reward for that, and he didn\u2019t.</p><hr><p>He could\nhave left, of course. Despite not being able to make himself seen or heard, he\nwasn\u2019t a ghost, so he wasn\u2019t tied to the Winchesters, not by any supernatural\nmeans at least. </p><p>But\u2026 </p><p>Despite\neverything, he\u2019d rather stay where he could make sure the boys were doing well,\nor at least as well as could be expected, given their track record. </p><p>He soon\nlearned that Cas was alive and kicking too, which was more than he could have\nreasonably expected considering Team Free Will\u2019s mortality rate, and he did regularly\nhelp out Sam and Dean on cases now. </p><p>As he had,\nof he was being honest, but he was a demon, so he had every right to keep lying\nto himself. </p><p>After a\nwhile, Crowley figured he wasn\u2019t going to get out of this unless he made a\nmiracle happen and got his reward. There probably would be a catch to that as\nwell, there usually was, but it had to be better than this existence he certainly\nwouldn\u2019t have called desirable by any means. </p><p>And so, creating\na miracle it was. </p><p>A miracle\nfor Dean Winchester, as they had forced him to admit to himself. Not that he\u2019d\never examined his\u2026 affection for the older Winchester too closely; but it wasn\u2019t\ndifficult to figure out what exactly the moirai had learned about them.</p><p>The problem\nwas that they hadn\u2019t exactly told him what constituted a miracle. If one of the\nboys had died recently, he could probably have resurrected them if he put his\nmind to it; but as stated before, they were alive and well for the time being. </p><p>There was\nalso the small fact that \u2013 well, the Winchesters either made miracles happen\nthemselves on a regular basis or had them happen to them; so there was very little\nwriggle room for him. </p><p>Good thing\nhe\u2019d always strived when faced with opposition.</p><hr><p>Dean was\nnot making this easy. \u00a0There were times\nwhen he appeared rather subdued and downcast, as if he was wishing for\nsomething, but Crowley could never figure out what exactly that something was. </p><p>But he was\ndetermined. </p><p>Sadly,\nnothing seemed to be working. Protecting Dean on cases really became second\nnature after a while, but clearly wasn\u2019t what the moirai expected of him; neither\nwas making sure the boys\u2019 fridge was always well stocked and throwing lore\ntheir way when it was convenient. </p><p>Sometimes\nhe thought Cassie suspected something, but he could never be sure with that\nangel. </p><p>And so he\ndid what he had always done and did his best to deal with what he had been given.\nUntil the day he decided he\u2019d had enough.</p><hr><p>Eventually\nhe simply grew tired of it all. He had no idea what to do about making a\nmiracle come true, and certainly not what Dean would want. </p><p>Dean was\nreading in the library when he stormed in. He was done. </p><p>\u201cDear God\nSquirrel, can\u2019t you give me a <i>hint</i>?\u201d\nAs strange as it sounded, he had </p><p>And to his\nastonishment, Dean raised his head and frowned. </p><p>\u201cSquirrel?\nI asked you what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>He slowly\nstood up. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you\nthink?\u201d Crowley asked, now genuinely intrigued. Neither of the boys had shown\nsigns of seeing or hearing him before, and it could reasonably be assumed that\nthey would be the first to suspect something was amiss. </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d\nDean said slowly, stepping further away from the table, \u201cIf you \u2013 and I am not saying\nyet that someone or something is in here with me \u2013 but if you happen to be on\nour side, I would appreciate a sign. I don\u2019t want to go down in history as the\nguy who killed Caspar dead.\u201d</p><p>He rolled\nhis eyes, then did the first thing that came to mind. </p><p>Dean\nwatched the glass of Craig float (Crowley assumed that was what it looked like to\nhim) towards him without batting an eye. </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d\nhe said after carefully taking a sip, \u201cSo you do have good taste in \u2013\u201c And\nthen, to Crowley\u2019s surprise, his eyes widened as he put the glass back on the\ntable. </p><p>\u201cThe only\none who would choose Craig when he could \u2013 Crowley? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>He wanted\nto answer, then; after all, it was the polite thing to do, and hadn\u2019t this been\nwhat he\u2019d wanted all along? </p><p>But instead\nof the promised reward, sudden pain made him almost keel over. There was a ringing\nin his ears, it felt like his blood was on fire, he couldn\u2019t speak, he couldn\u2019t\nthink \u2013 </p><p>And then\ntwo hands caught him. \u201cTake it easy, man.\u201d</p><p>He was\npushed into a chair as Dean leaned over him, trying to see what was wrong. He quickly\ntook stock himself. The pain had gone, but there was a strange pounding in his\nears, and when he thought about it, his ribcage too, as if \u2013 as if \u2013 </p><p>But that\ncouldn\u2019t be possible, surely? They had promised him a reward, not \u2013 </p><p>\u201cWell, you\nlook awful\u201d Dean said bluntly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not\nexactly a sight for sore eyes, either.\u201d It was a lie, of course; one of the\nthings that had always most annoyed Crowley about the Winchesters was that they\nwere sadly handsome; but he wasn\u2019t about to start complimenting him now \u2013 </p><p>Dean was\nbusy taking his pulse. \u201cReally, Squirrel?\u201d he asked tiredly. There would have\nbeen no point in dragging a living meat suit around all these years \u2013 </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nsteadying. That\u2019s something\u201d he said, sounding rather happy about that fact,\nwhile Crowley was still busy processing what was supposed to be steadying in\nthe first place \u2013 </p><p>When he\nrealized he jumped up. </p><p>\u201cHey\u201d Dean\ncomplained, \u201cSit back down. You only just got resurrected, and I do know from\nfirst-hand experience that coming back to life can be \u2013\u201c</p><p>He didn\u2019t\nlisten to him. \u201cI\u2019m human\u201d he breathed \u2013 breathed.</p><p>Dean\nfrowned. \u201cYes, that\u2019s rather obvious. Did you make some kind of deal? Because id\nyou did, sorry to break it to you, but they have a habit of becoming \u2013\u201c</p><p>He quickly\ntold him what happened. </p><p>\u201cThe moirai?\nWell, from what I can remember, they usually didn\u2019t involve themselves with\nmortal affairs all that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\nremember it as the greatest of honours\u201d he said dryly. </p><p>Dean chuckled.\n\u201cMan, I probably shouldn\u2019t say that, but I missed this.\u201d</p><p>Crowley had\nno idea what to say in reply. </p><p>\u201cCome on,\nlet\u2019s have a drink. Only one though your Majesty; can\u2019t put too much on your\nrecently-humanized liver.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t\nfetch Sam or Cas, which was soon explained by the fact that it was in the\nmiddle of the night and he had once more been unable to sleep. Maybe he should\nhave tried to help him get some more rest. That would have been a miracle\nindeed. </p><p>That reminded\nCrowley. \u201cI suppose this is punishment.\u201d</p><p>Dean raised\nan eyebrow. \u201cPunishment? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u201d\nhe shrugged. \u201cI was going top get a reward for making a miracle happen.\u201d\nGranted, he hadn\u2019t quite told Dean everything.</p><p>\u201cSorry Peaches,\nbut I think this is supposed to be your reward. It may just be a mortal life,\nbut it\u2019s always been enough for us \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cBut no\nmiracle occurred\u201d he said and Dean stared at him as if he\u2019d suddenly grown two\nheads. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nhere, man\u201d Dean said. \u201cSounds like enough of a miracle for me.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\ndidn\u2019t know where to look. </p><p>Thankfully,\nDean apparently didn\u2019t expect him to speak, and so they sat quietly in the\nlibrary for a while, sipping their drinks and contemplating the future. </p><p>Maybe, he\nreflected, for tonight, simply having one could be enough. </p>",

Not that he\u2019d\never examined his\u2026 affection for the older Winchester too closely; but it wasn\u2019t\ndifficult to figure out what exactly the moirai had learned about them.</p><p>The problem\nwas that they hadn\u2019t exactly told him what constituted a miracle. If one of the\nboys had died recently, he could probably have resurrected them if he put his\nmind to it; but as stated before, they were alive and well for the time being. </p><p>There was\nalso the small fact that \u2013 well, the Winchesters either made miracles happen\nthemselves on a regular basis or had them happen to them; so there was very little\nwriggle room for him. </p><p>Good thing\nhe\u2019d always strived when faced with opposition.</p><hr><p>Dean was\nnot making this easy. \u00a0There were times\nwhen he appeared rather subdued and downcast, as if he was wishing for\nsomething, but Crowley could never figure out what exactly that something was. </p><p>But he was\ndetermined. </p><p>Sadly,\nnothing seemed to be working. Protecting Dean on cases really became second\nnature after a while, but clearly wasn\u2019t what the moirai expected of him; neither\nwas making sure the boys\u2019 fridge was always well stocked and throwing lore\ntheir way when it was convenient. </p><p>Sometimes\nhe thought Cassie suspected something, but he could never be sure with that\nangel. </p><p>And so he\ndid what he had always done and did his best to deal with what he had been given.\nUntil the day he decided he\u2019d had enough.</p><hr><p>Eventually\nhe simply grew tired of it all. He had no idea what to do about making a\nmiracle come true, and certainly not what Dean would want. </p><p>Dean was\nreading in the library when he stormed in. He was done. </p><p>\u201cDear God\nSquirrel, can\u2019t you give me a <i>hint</i>?\u201d\nAs strange as it sounded, he had </p><p>And to his\nastonishment, Dean raised his head and frowned. </p><p>\u201cSquirrel?\nI asked you what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>He slowly\nstood up. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you\nthink?\u201d Crowley asked, now genuinely intrigued. Neither of the boys had shown\nsigns of seeing or hearing him before, and it could reasonably be assumed that\nthey would be the first to suspect something was amiss. </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d\nDean said slowly, stepping further away from the table, \u201cIf you \u2013 and I am not saying\nyet that someone or something is in here with me \u2013 but if you happen to be on\nour side, I would appreciate a sign. I don\u2019t want to go down in history as the\nguy who killed Caspar dead.\u201d</p><p>He rolled\nhis eyes, then did the first thing that came to mind. </p><p>Dean\nwatched the glass of Craig float (Crowley assumed that was what it looked like to\nhim) towards him without batting an eye. </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d\nhe said after carefully taking a sip, \u201cSo you do have good taste in \u2013\u201c And\nthen, to Crowley\u2019s surprise, his eyes widened as he put the glass back on the\ntable. </p><p>\u201cThe only\none who would choose Craig when he could \u2013 Crowley? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>He wanted\nto answer, then; after all, it was the polite thing to do, and hadn\u2019t this been\nwhat he\u2019d wanted all along? </p><p>But instead\nof the promised reward, sudden pain made him almost keel over. There was a ringing\nin his ears, it felt like his blood was on fire, he couldn\u2019t speak, he couldn\u2019t\nthink \u2013 </p><p>And then\ntwo hands caught him. \u201cTake it easy, man.\u201d</p><p>He was\npushed into a chair as Dean leaned over him, trying to see what was wrong. He quickly\ntook stock himself. The pain had gone, but there was a strange pounding in his\nears, and when he thought about it, his ribcage too, as if \u2013 as if \u2013 </p><p>But that\ncouldn\u2019t be possible, surely? They had promised him a reward, not \u2013 </p><p>\u201cWell, you\nlook awful\u201d Dean said bluntly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not\nexactly a sight for sore eyes, either.\u201d It was a lie, of course; one of the\nthings that had always most annoyed Crowley about the Winchesters was that they\nwere sadly handsome; but he wasn\u2019t about to start complimenting him now \u2013 </p><p>Dean was\nbusy taking his pulse. \u201cReally, Squirrel?\u201d he asked tiredly. There would have\nbeen no point in dragging a living meat suit around all these years \u2013 </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nsteadying. That\u2019s something\u201d he said, sounding rather happy about that fact,\nwhile Crowley was still busy processing what was supposed to be steadying in\nthe first place \u2013 </p><p>When he\nrealized he jumped up. </p><p>\u201cHey\u201d Dean\ncomplained, \u201cSit back down. You only just got resurrected, and I do know from\nfirst-hand experience that coming back to life can be \u2013\u201c</p><p>He didn\u2019t\nlisten to him. \u201cI\u2019m human\u201d he breathed \u2013 breathed.</p><p>Dean\nfrowned. \u201cYes, that\u2019s rather obvious. Did you make some kind of deal? Because id\nyou did, sorry to break it to you, but they have a habit of becoming \u2013\u201c</p><p>He quickly\ntold him what happened. </p><p>\u201cThe moirai?\nWell, from what I can remember, they usually didn\u2019t involve themselves with\nmortal affairs all that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\nremember it as the greatest of honours\u201d he said dryly. </p><p>Dean chuckled.\n\u201cMan, I probably shouldn\u2019t say that, but I missed this.\u201d</p><p>Crowley had\nno idea what to say in reply. </p><p>\u201cCome on,\nlet\u2019s have a drink. Only one though your Majesty; can\u2019t put too much on your\nrecently-humanized liver.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t\nfetch Sam or Cas, which was soon explained by the fact that it was in the\nmiddle of the night and he had once more been unable to sleep. Maybe he should\nhave tried to help him get some more rest. That would have been a miracle\nindeed. </p><p>That reminded\nCrowley. \u201cI suppose this is punishment.\u201d</p><p>Dean raised\nan eyebrow. \u201cPunishment? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u201d\nhe shrugged. \u201cI was going top get a reward for making a miracle happen.\u201d\nGranted, he hadn\u2019t quite told Dean everything.</p><p>\u201cSorry Peaches,\nbut I think this is supposed to be your reward. It may just be a mortal life,\nbut it\u2019s always been enough for us \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cBut no\nmiracle occurred\u201d he said and Dean stared at him as if he\u2019d suddenly grown two\nheads. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nhere, man\u201d Dean said. \u201cSounds like enough of a miracle for me.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\ndidn\u2019t know where to look. </p><p>Thankfully,\nDean apparently didn\u2019t expect him to speak, and so they sat quietly in the\nlibrary for a while, sipping their drinks and contemplating the future. </p><p>Maybe, he\nreflected, for tonight, simply having one could be enough. </p>",

Protecting Dean on cases really became second\nnature after a while, but clearly wasn&rsquo;t what the moirai expected of him; neither\nwas making sure the boys&rsquo; fridge was always well stocked and throwing lore\ntheir way when it was convenient. </p><p>Sometimes\nhe thought Cassie suspected something, but he could never be sure with that\nangel. </p><p>And so he\ndid what he had always done and did his best to deal with what he had been given.\nUntil the day he decided he&rsquo;d had enough.</p><hr /><p>Eventually\nhe simply grew tired of it all. He had no idea what to do about making a\nmiracle come true, and certainly not what Dean would want. </p><p>Dean was\nreading in the library when he stormed in. He was done. </p><p>&ldquo;Dear God\nSquirrel, can&rsquo;t you give me a <i>hint</i>?&rdquo;\nAs strange as it sounded, he had </p><p>And to his\nastonishment, Dean raised his head and frowned. </p><p>&ldquo;Squirrel?\nI asked you what you wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>He slowly\nstood up. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who do you\nthink?&rdquo; Crowley asked, now genuinely intrigued. Neither of the boys had shown\nsigns of seeing or hearing him before, and it could reasonably be assumed that\nthey would be the first to suspect something was amiss. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright&rdquo;\nDean said slowly, stepping further away from the table, &ldquo;If you &ndash; and I am not saying\nyet that someone or something is in here with me &ndash; but if you happen to be on\nour side, I would appreciate a sign. I don&rsquo;t want to go down in history as the\nguy who killed Caspar dead.&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled\nhis eyes, then did the first thing that came to mind. </p><p>Dean\nwatched the glass of Craig float (Crowley assumed that was what it looked like to\nhim) towards him without batting an eye. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright&rdquo;\nhe said after carefully taking a sip, &ldquo;So you do have good taste in &ndash;&ldquo; And\nthen, to Crowley&rsquo;s surprise, his eyes widened as he put the glass back on the\ntable. </p><p>&ldquo;The only\none who would choose Craig when he could &ndash; Crowley? Is that you?&rdquo;</p><p>He wanted\nto answer, then; after all, it was the polite thing to do, and hadn&rsquo;t this been\nwhat he&rsquo;d wanted all along? </p><p>But instead\nof the promised reward, sudden pain made him almost keel over. There was a ringing\nin his ears, it felt like his blood was on fire, he couldn&rsquo;t speak, he couldn&rsquo;t\nthink &ndash; </p><p>And then\ntwo hands caught him. &ldquo;Take it easy, man.&rdquo;</p><p>He was\npushed into a chair as Dean leaned over him, trying to see what was wrong. He quickly\ntook stock himself. The pain had gone, but there was a strange pounding in his\nears, and when he thought about it, his ribcage too, as if &ndash; as if &ndash; </p><p>But that\ncouldn&rsquo;t be possible, surely? They had promised him a reward, not &ndash; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, you\nlook awful&rdquo; Dean said bluntly. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not\nexactly a sight for sore eyes, either.&rdquo; It was a lie, of course; one of the\nthings that had always most annoyed Crowley about the Winchesters was that they\nwere sadly handsome; but he wasn&rsquo;t about to start complimenting him now &ndash; </p><p>Dean was\nbusy taking his pulse. &ldquo;Really, Squirrel?&rdquo; he asked tiredly. There would have\nbeen no point in dragging a living meat suit around all these years &ndash; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nsteadying. That&rsquo;s something&rdquo; he said, sounding rather happy about that fact,\nwhile Crowley was still busy processing what was supposed to be steadying in\nthe first place &ndash; </p><p>When he\nrealized he jumped up. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo; Dean\ncomplained, &ldquo;Sit back down. You only just got resurrected, and I do know from\nfirst-hand experience that coming back to life can be &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t\nlisten to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m human&rdquo; he breathed &ndash; breathed.</p><p>Dean\nfrowned. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s rather obvious. Did you make some kind of deal? Because id\nyou did, sorry to break it to you, but they have a habit of becoming &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>He quickly\ntold him what happened. </p><p>&ldquo;The moirai?\nWell, from what I can remember, they usually didn&rsquo;t involve themselves with\nmortal affairs all that much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will\nremember it as the greatest of honours&rdquo; he said dryly. </p><p>Dean chuckled.\n&ldquo;Man, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t say that, but I missed this.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley had\nno idea what to say in reply. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on,\nlet&rsquo;s have a drink. Only one though your Majesty; can&rsquo;t put too much on your\nrecently-humanized liver.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t\nfetch Sam or Cas, which was soon explained by the fact that it was in the\nmiddle of the night and he had once more been unable to sleep. Maybe he should\nhave tried to help him get some more rest. That would have been a miracle\nindeed. </p><p>That reminded\nCrowley. &ldquo;I suppose this is punishment.&rdquo;</p><p>Dean raised\nan eyebrow. &ldquo;Punishment? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you&rdquo;\nhe shrugged. &ldquo;I was going top get a reward for making a miracle happen.&rdquo;\nGranted, he hadn&rsquo;t quite told Dean everything.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Peaches,\nbut I think this is supposed to be your reward. It may just be a mortal life,\nbut it&rsquo;s always been enough for us &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But no\nmiracle occurred&rdquo; he said and Dean stared at him as if he&rsquo;d suddenly grown two\nheads. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nhere, man&rdquo; Dean said. &ldquo;Sounds like enough of a miracle for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\ndidn&rsquo;t know where to look. </p><p>Thankfully,\nDean apparently didn&rsquo;t expect him to speak, and so they sat quietly in the\nlibrary for a while, sipping their drinks and contemplating the future. </p><p>Maybe, he\nreflected, for tonight, simply having one could be enough. </p>",
