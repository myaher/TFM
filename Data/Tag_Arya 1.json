It\u2019s Arya\u2026 of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe was your father\u2026 the Hand, the traitor\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe was <i>never</i>\u00a0a traitor! Joffrey is a liar!\u201d<br></p><p><b>\u201cSo you\u2019re a highborn then, you\u2019re a Lady?!\u201d</b><br></p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 <b>I mean, <i>yes</i></b>\u2026 my mother was a Lady, and my sister\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, but, <b>you were a Lord\u2019s daughter, and you lived in a castle, and\u2026\u201d</b><br></p></blockquote><p>First thing\u2019s first - Arya doesn\u2019t actually deny that she is a Lady. She argues, because we know Arya is deeply conflicted over what being a Lady <i>means</i>. She starts with\u00a0\u2018No\u2019 because the societal expectations of what being a Lady is? She struggles with that. But she <i>knows</i>\u00a0that society wise, she still <i>is</i>\u00a0a highborn. She <i>is</i>\u00a0a Lady. Even in Season 7, Arya accepts this - Brienne calls her\u00a0\u201cMy Lady\u201d and Arya doesn\u2019t fight her on it at all. The Brotherhood call Arya \u201cLittle Lady\u201d. She knows that society wise, she <i>is</i>\u00a0a Lady.\u00a0</p><p>Secondly - when Arya tries to deny that she is a Lady, however feebly, <i>Gendry immediately calls her out on it</i>.\u00a0\u201cYou were a Lord\u2019s daughter, and you lived in a castle.\u201d He doesn\u2019t understand the nuanced struggle of being a non-conforming highborn, because he is lowborn. To him, being a Lady or Lord is as simple as that\u2019s what you\u2019re born into. Where Arya grew up and lived, and the family she was born into, defines her as a Lady.\u00a0</p><p>Gendry\u2019s proposal is borne out of the fact he now sees himself and Arya to be on the same level now, societally. Her being highborn is the entire reason he was going to stay behind with the Brotherhood - because he didn\u2019t see their friendship being allowed to continue as soon as they were with her family (\u201cYou\u2019d be m\u2019lady\u201d). Him being legitimised makes him a Lord; and she is <i>already</i>\u00a0a Lady. It simply puts them on the same level.\u00a0</p><p>Arya replying with\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a Lady. That\u2019s not me.\u201d would have <i>immediately</i>\u00a0been called out by Gendry. He\u2019s done it before, years ago. If we\u2019re going to have Arya pulling up old lines she used to say, then Gendry should have been consistent too - and Gendry being consistent would have meant him saying something along the lines of\u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, then who\u2019s family castle are we currently stood in?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The fact Arya is one of the\u00a0\u2018most important people of Westeros\u2019 allowed at that meeting where they select Bran as King <i>again</i>\u00a0highlights that <i>Arya is a Lady societally. </i>If she wasn\u2019t, she would have <i>zero</i>\u00a0reason (or allowance) to be there. Hell, Arya\u2019s endgame in the show of sailing away is once again linked to the fact that society wise <i>she is a Lady</i>. She is able to buy a ship, deck it out and design it in direwolf imagery, <i>because of the money her highborn family has</i>. Saying she rejects the societal structures means she is in a <i>massive</i>\u00a0point of privilege within the system - because she can afford to go\u00a0\u2018No\u2019 where others have zero choice whatsoever. Financially, her highborn status allows it.\u00a0</p><p>Gendry being in character would have called her out on this. Gendry being in character would have pointed out Lyanna Mormont is a Lady, but a warrior too. Gendry being in character would have pointed out Brienne of Tarth is a Lady, but a warrior too. Gendry being in character would have reiterated that to him, all it means is him and Arya are <i>finally</i>\u00a0on a level playing field society wise. And that he wouldn\u2019t <i>expect</i>\u00a0her to be spending her days sewing.\u00a0</p><p>Gendry would have called Arya out on this babbling of old lines, because he had no patience for this mindset six years ago, so why on earth would he suddenly have patience for it now? Arya\u2019s refusal made no sense; but Gendry\u2019s lack of rebuttal against this inane statement also made sense. D&amp;D really separated them for literally <i>no logical reason whatsoever</i>.</p>",
                "content": "<p>The more I think about the way D&amp;D framed Arya&rsquo;s refusal to Gendry&rsquo;s proposal, the more infuriated I get. Not because of it being out of character for Arya, actually - but because of how out of character just accepting that answer is for Gendry. And by that I mean that Gendry would have called out her excuse of&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Lady.&rdquo;</b> If D&amp;D want to pull back past things characters have said and frame it as&nbsp;&lsquo;continuity&rsquo;, then this should have been followed by Gendry calling her out on this.</p><p>Think back to Season 2, when Arya tells Gendry who she is, and the conversation which follows:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;My names not Arry. It&rsquo;s Arya&hellip; of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He was your father&hellip; the Hand, the traitor&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He was <i>never</i>&nbsp;a traitor!

Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa\u2026Sansa is your sister. You may be as different as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as she needs you\u2026and I need both of you, gods help me.\u201d<br/>\nHe sounded so tired that it made Arya sad. \u201cI don\u2019t hate Sansa,\u201d she told him. \u201cNot truly.\u201d It was only half a lie.<br/>\n\u201cI do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you. We have come to a dark dangerous place, child. This is not Winterfell. We have enemies who mean us ill. We cannot fight a war among ourselves. This willfulness of yours, the running off, the angry words, the disobedience\u2026 At home, these were only the summer games of a child.
