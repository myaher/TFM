He\nis grateful that she have saved them and to finally accept to help them. He\nhas sympathy for her and even a little affection, especially seeing how she\nreacts: all cute and full of hope. But NOTHING justified him\nbending the knee. None of their previous\nscene led to this. And\nabove all, he would never bend the knee barely awake, without having fully\nrecovered his mind etc \u2026 He did this on the spur of the moment to put\nDaenerys in the pocket.

And there comes the big problem: Cersei asks him to\nswear that he will remain neutral in the conflict with Daenerys. Jon seems\nreally annoyed by this request, thinks, looks at Daenerys then makes the\ndecision to announce that he has already pledged allegiance to Daenerys.

He spoke to Daenerys \nprivately,\nwithout even physically bending his knee. But then he had to make a \ndecision.\nTo lie by giving allegiance to Cersei which displeased him and thus \nshowed\nDaenerys that he was able to lie to put a queen on his side (which was a\n great\nrisk) or officialized his allegiance to Daenerys (this would make the \noath truly\nvalid and not a word in the air). He determined that having Daenerys, \nher dragons and army on his side was more important than the few\ntroops of Cersei (especially if he remembered the words of his sister \nabout the\nfact that Cersei is not worth their trust). Except now, here he is \nstuck. Not\nonly does Cersei seem unwilling to help them, but even Daenerys and \nTyrion\nblame him for not lying. Jon then goes on to say that if lies pile up, \nwords\nlose their meaning. We understand that he is really frustrated by all \nthat.</p><p>After this stormy\nmoment, Jon and Daenerys share a rather interesting moment. Jon seems softer\ntowards her and, for the first time, we see him seem to have sincerely\naffection for her. He is not trying to convince her at\nthis time. They are just 2 young people discussing. Although it seems clear\nthat Daenerys is the one who have the strongest feelings.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9c751fa6a1b673aac2882e5f8b41212/tumblr_inline_phrl5qrgqG1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9c751fa6a1b673aac2882e5f8b41212/tumblr_inline_phs8zcwMn31rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9c751fa6a1b673aac2882e5f8b41212/tumblr_inline_phrl5qrgqG1rsvpj6_540.gif\"/></figure><p>She is in love\nwith him, always takes the first step towards him and is the one who confides.\nJon is content to listen to her and \u201csupport\u201d her in her confidences.</p><p>It is only after\nall this that Jon sends a letter to his sister informing her that he has bent the knee and that he arrives with Daenerys. Although I think it\u2019s not trivial\nthat this letter was shown by the staff and that Jon starts by talking about\nCersei who joined her troops to them and then uses exactly the same formula to\nsay that he has pledged allegiance to Daenerys . We can say that Jon makes\nSansa understand that for Cersei AND Daenerys, it is not so simple nor honest\nthan that.</p><p>Finally, we have\none last really weird scene. Jon, hesitating in front of his queen\u2019s room\nbefore finally knocking. Then the two sleep together (without having either a\nfirst kiss and sexual tension leading to the act).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"434\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed369dd0a355d550b55ee897f64f0c90/tumblr_inline_phrl5vCugc1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed369dd0a355d550b55ee897f64f0c90/tumblr_inline_phs8zdrTYX1rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"434\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed369dd0a355d550b55ee897f64f0c90/tumblr_inline_phrl5vCugc1rsvpj6_540.gif\"/></figure><p>The fact that Jon\nseems to hesitate before knocking is important. Despite Daenerys\u2019 feelings and\nJon\u2019s attraction to her, it seems clear to me that he is not in love. And that\nthere were not really any intimate moments between them that could lead to this\nscene. Unlike Dario who flirts with Daenerys for a while before getting into\nher apartments. In addition, we are talking about Jon.</p><p>In my opinion,\nJon takes a little desperately the opportunity of the situation and feelings of\nDaenerys. He is neither manipulator nor calculator. There is truth in what he\ndoes. Yes, he\u2019s sorry for her dragon. Yes, she is beautiful. Yes, she attracts\nhim and he has affection for her. Yes, now that it is official, he considers in\npart that he owes her allegiance. But no, Jon does not love her. No, he will\nnot give up his kingdom just because she has a \u201cgood heart\u201d. No, he\nwill not forget where his loyalty is.</p><p>We have seen it\nwith the Widlings: sleeping with Ygrid made Jon sure that she was faithful to\nhim against his own people, and the widlings were less suspicious of him. He\nloved Ygrid though but lied because his true allegiance was to the Night Watch.\nI think it\u2019s the same here. By ensuring the love of Daenerys, he protects his\npeople. She will be better able to listen to him so that he can better present\nher to his subjects. That\u2019s why he insists that she comes with him at\nWinterfell and not on the back of a dragon, that he tells her \u201cif we have\nto be allies in this war\u201d etc. This is an allegiance provisional to ensure\nthe good continuity of things. As for the continuation, he will see later with\nhis people, his family and Ser Davos. But it is to them that his loyalty goes.\nAnd if they decide, after meeting Daenerys, that they still want to be independent, I\ncan not see Jon denying it for them.</p><p>I will finally\nadd that I wonder if the attraction of Jon (but also Daenerys) is not also due\nto their blood Targaryen. That they feel attracted to each other but without\nknowing why. I think it\u2019s more obvious from Jon\u2019s point of view as he spends\nmost of the season focusing on the king of the night and being frustrated by\nDaenerys\u2019 rejections. Because despite all that, he is attracted by her without\nreally understanding why. And maybe with time his feelings will grow. We can already see how he has allowed himself a little more in her presence since he announced publicly that he was loyal to her.</p><p>We\u2019ll see&hellip;<br/></p>",

When Jon declares that he is going to go and\nDaenerys reminds him that she is holding him back and has not given him permission,\nJon gets angry and reminds her sharply that he is king and that he does not\nneed his permission. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a1dc9b04a611f752fc85d917ad8791a/tumblr_inline_phrkevXKjb1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/16dd5d8671546e3a5518319833da3e78/tumblr_inline_phs8z5gGBw1rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a1dc9b04a611f752fc85d917ad8791a/tumblr_inline_phrkevXKjb1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/44160dee7aa48bc03f423a21685bb686/tumblr_inline_phrkfphUOw1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e093bd568f7e4eba4b0ec79b5c773056/tumblr_inline_phs8z5aNOJ1rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/44160dee7aa48bc03f423a21685bb686/tumblr_inline_phrkfphUOw1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><p> Seventh\ninteraction: Here he is about to leave, he bids farewell to Daenerys the mind\nalready focused on his mission and goes away without a look back unlike Jorah.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1deb8b0c64767fe9d032826c5c509cd6/tumblr_inline_phrkg5Rx0L1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/56737591237959fcfee8652735d6c699/tumblr_inline_phs8z6pDYL1rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1deb8b0c64767fe9d032826c5c509cd6/tumblr_inline_phrkg5Rx0L1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdffa631add0d34df2839e5e7bad5d57/tumblr_inline_phrkgtBl0U1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/08cc125dc9038ff26046c0b2617dff96/tumblr_inline_phs8z6TOh21rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdffa631add0d34df2839e5e7bad5d57/tumblr_inline_phrkgtBl0U1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"175\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab3bd0e2ce54b44b9dac82984e18b13c/tumblr_inline_phrl0hIQsb1rsvpj6_540.gif\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab3bd0e2ce54b44b9dac82984e18b13c/tumblr_inline_phs8z62tBT1rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"175\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab3bd0e2ce54b44b9dac82984e18b13c/tumblr_inline_phrl0hIQsb1rsvpj6_540.gif\"></figure><p>I think it\u2019s\nimportant to point out that Jon, in most scenes with Daenerys where he\u2019s not\nreally trying to convince her (cave, meeting) or observe her (dragon), has his\ngaze fixed on the ground or towards the horizon. As if his mind was elsewhere\nand he was not really looking at her.

Jon\nsays he\u2019s sorry, catches the hand of the queen, says he would like to go back,\netc. He really shows his remorse. Daenerys\ndoes not blame him and, on the contrary, invests herself personally in the\nbattle. Jon\nseems enormously relieved and thanks her by using a nickname that does not seem\nto be the right one. After\na look at her and a deep breath, came the famous \u201cHow about my queen? I will have bent my knee but \u2026\n\u201d There\nis an exchange on the lords of the North and the fact that Dany hopes to be\nworthy of his allegiance. Jon, telling\nher that she is, really seems to be lying. The\nway he has to slowly lift his eyelids, to fix his gaze in a very calm manner\nand to say \u201cyou are,\u201d exudes falseness. He\nis not a very good liar and there is a background of truth in his lyrics which\nmakes this moment special and compelling but not enough for those who have\nfollowed Jon for 7 seasons. His\nnew queen then asks him to rest, he closes his eyes but, as soon as she leaves,\nreopens them, turns, looks up at the ceiling and sighs deeply. This scene is not trivial.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"151\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29b68d9f531e28bda2f7a6323238dcc1/tumblr_inline_phrl1wJO3l1rsvpj6_540.gif\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29b68d9f531e28bda2f7a6323238dcc1/tumblr_inline_phs8z7tN1E1rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"151\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29b68d9f531e28bda2f7a6323238dcc1/tumblr_inline_phrl1wJO3l1rsvpj6_540.gif\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9cae30ccd7aea6b76da084c30845e3c/tumblr_inline_phrkieX1XS1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83f35b95b72c4104c0e4bc6ff2f07610/tumblr_inline_phs8z8HLVb1rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9cae30ccd7aea6b76da084c30845e3c/tumblr_inline_phrkieX1XS1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/36f7189b7795f515493ae3be078c8c1b/tumblr_inline_phrkj1P25w1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e87b34e7c26f72faed7e8a77073809/tumblr_inline_phs8z8nP9V1rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/36f7189b7795f515493ae3be078c8c1b/tumblr_inline_phrkj1P25w1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b453e56a8a0e8131e08a09ac495dd25/tumblr_inline_phrl4bnwgZ1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b453e56a8a0e8131e08a09ac495dd25/tumblr_inline_phs8z8HIQg1rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b453e56a8a0e8131e08a09ac495dd25/tumblr_inline_phrl4bnwgZ1rsvpj6_540.gif\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0f932ba8a8a86f9a8fa35add843c851/tumblr_inline_phrl4iTCAn1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0f932ba8a8a86f9a8fa35add843c851/tumblr_inline_phs8z9ebL11rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0f932ba8a8a86f9a8fa35add843c851/tumblr_inline_phrl4iTCAn1rsvpj6_540.gif\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b3665d468e215d6ad19ba80858b258c/tumblr_inline_phrl34THmK1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b3665d468e215d6ad19ba80858b258c/tumblr_inline_phs8zaDjPL1rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b3665d468e215d6ad19ba80858b258c/tumblr_inline_phrl34THmK1rsvpj6_540.gif\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/beaa1dc8cdaa230fafd02f01f87310a1/tumblr_inline_phrkk2yoba1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79084d9092a759139edb425148b14f32/tumblr_inline_phs8zav2M21rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/beaa1dc8cdaa230fafd02f01f87310a1/tumblr_inline_phrkk2yoba1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><p><br>\nFrom\nwhat I think: Jon was afraid that Daenerys would blame him for the death of her\ndragon, seeing that she was not doing it, he was reassured but still wanted to\nbe nice to her to avoid any future change of opinion. With\nhis mind confused and taken aback, he finds himself calling her his queen and\ntalking about bending the knee. Words that he does not really\nthink. He\nis grateful that she have saved them and to finally accept to help them. He\nhas sympathy for her and even a little affection, especially seeing how she\nreacts: all cute and full of hope. But NOTHING justified him\nbending the knee. None of their previous\nscene led to this. And\nabove all, he would never bend the knee barely awake, without having fully\nrecovered his mind etc \u2026 He did this on the spur of the moment to put\nDaenerys in the pocket. Which explains his sigh at\nthe end.</p><p><br>\nIt\nis important to speak about Jon not telling Davos what he did. He does not say it to Tyrion\neither. Nobody\nknows it except Daenerys.</p><p><br>\nThen comes\nthe big meeting with Cersei. Jon does his little class \u201cHow to kill a\nWhite in 2 lessons\u201d. And there comes the big problem: Cersei asks him to\nswear that he will remain neutral in the conflict with Daenerys. Jon seems\nreally annoyed by this request, thinks, looks at Daenerys then makes the\ndecision to announce that he has already pledged allegiance to Daenerys. This\ndeeply shocks Ser Davos.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a5c335d43860387e160b997438d023a/tumblr_inline_phrkl43dHs1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9032ef6455ff7dbeb63a9bb6dcbd3f1f/tumblr_inline_phs8zbyodc1rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a5c335d43860387e160b997438d023a/tumblr_inline_phrkl43dHs1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef291a7fe3311b5012bf9c4f1a092185/tumblr_inline_phrkliMdUE1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83e7c4b4f3cf69b33875129d7070750a/tumblr_inline_phs8zc7Tvu1rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef291a7fe3311b5012bf9c4f1a092185/tumblr_inline_phrkliMdUE1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/860adfe1948eaabd81dac5c5fdf864c7/tumblr_inline_phrkm5DwbN1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cfbff88f6bc447c0df4d02fad676a1ed/tumblr_inline_phs8zcfSsA1rsvpj6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"311\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/860adfe1948eaabd81dac5c5fdf864c7/tumblr_inline_phrkm5DwbN1rsvpj6_540.png\"></figure><p>In\n my opinion,\nJon did not expect things to go that far. He spoke to Daenerys \nprivately,\nwithout even physically bending his knee. But then he had to make a \ndecision.\nTo lie by giving allegiance to Cersei which displeased him and thus \nshowed\nDaenerys that he was able to lie to put a queen on his side (which was a\n great\nrisk) or officialized his allegiance to Daenerys (this would make the \noath truly\nvalid and not a word in the air). He determined that having Daenerys, \nher dragons and army on his side was more important than the few\ntroops of Cersei (especially if he remembered the words of his sister \nabout the\nfact that Cersei is not worth their trust). Except now, here he is \nstuck. Not\nonly does Cersei seem unwilling to help them, but even Daenerys and \nTyrion\nblame him for not lying. Jon then goes on to say that if lies pile up, \nwords\nlose their meaning. We understand that he is really frustrated by all \nthat.</p><p>After this stormy\nmoment, Jon and Daenerys share a rather interesting moment. Jon seems softer\ntowards her and, for the first time, we see him seem to have sincerely\naffection for her. He is not trying to convince her at\nthis time. They are just 2 young people discussing. Although it seems clear\nthat Daenerys is the one who have the strongest feelings.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9c751fa6a1b673aac2882e5f8b41212/tumblr_inline_phrl5qrgqG1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9c751fa6a1b673aac2882e5f8b41212/tumblr_inline_phs8zcwMn31rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9c751fa6a1b673aac2882e5f8b41212/tumblr_inline_phrl5qrgqG1rsvpj6_540.gif\"></figure><p>She is in love\nwith him, always takes the first step towards him and is the one who confides.\nJon is content to listen to her and \u201csupport\u201d her in her confidences.</p><p>It is only after\nall this that Jon sends a letter to his sister informing her that he has bent the knee and that he arrives with Daenerys. Although I think it\u2019s not trivial\nthat this letter was shown by the staff and that Jon starts by talking about\nCersei who joined her troops to them and then uses exactly the same formula to\nsay that he has pledged allegiance to Daenerys . We can say that Jon makes\nSansa understand that for Cersei AND Daenerys, it is not so simple nor honest\nthan that.</p><p>Finally, we have\none last really weird scene. Jon, hesitating in front of his queen\u2019s room\nbefore finally knocking. Then the two sleep together (without having either a\nfirst kiss and sexual tension leading to the act).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"434\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed369dd0a355d550b55ee897f64f0c90/tumblr_inline_phrl5vCugc1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed369dd0a355d550b55ee897f64f0c90/tumblr_inline_phs8zdrTYX1rsvpj6_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"434\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed369dd0a355d550b55ee897f64f0c90/tumblr_inline_phrl5vCugc1rsvpj6_540.gif\"></figure><p>The fact that Jon\nseems to hesitate before knocking is important. Despite Daenerys\u2019 feelings and\nJon\u2019s attraction to her, it seems clear to me that he is not in love. And that\nthere were not really any intimate moments between them that could lead to this\nscene. Unlike Dario who flirts with Daenerys for a while before getting into\nher apartments. In addition, we are talking about Jon.</p><p>In my opinion,\nJon takes a little desperately the opportunity of the situation and feelings of\nDaenerys. He is neither manipulator nor calculator. There is truth in what he\ndoes. Yes, he\u2019s sorry for her dragon. Yes, she is beautiful. Yes, she attracts\nhim and he has affection for her. Yes, now that it is official, he considers in\npart that he owes her allegiance. But no, Jon does not love her. No, he will\nnot give up his kingdom just because she has a \u201cgood heart\u201d. No, he\nwill not forget where his loyalty is.</p><p>We have seen it\nwith the Widlings: sleeping with Ygrid made Jon sure that she was faithful to\nhim against his own people, and the widlings were less suspicious of him. He\nloved Ygrid though but lied because his true allegiance was to the Night Watch.\nI think it\u2019s the same here. By ensuring the love of Daenerys, he protects his\npeople. She will be better able to listen to him so that he can better present\nher to his subjects. That\u2019s why he insists that she comes with him at\nWinterfell and not on the back of a dragon, that he tells her \u201cif we have\nto be allies in this war\u201d etc. This is an allegiance provisional to ensure\nthe good continuity of things. As for the continuation, he will see later with\nhis people, his family and Ser Davos. But it is to them that his loyalty goes.\nAnd if they decide, after meeting Daenerys, that they still want to be independent, I\ncan not see Jon denying it for them.</p><p>I will finally\nadd that I wonder if the attraction of Jon (but also Daenerys) is not also due\nto their blood Targaryen. That they feel attracted to each other but without\nknowing why. I think it\u2019s more obvious from Jon\u2019s point of view as he spends\nmost of the season focusing on the king of the night and being frustrated by\nDaenerys\u2019 rejections. Because despite all that, he is attracted by her without\nreally understanding why. And maybe with time his feelings will grow. We can already see how he has allowed himself a little more in her presence since he announced publicly that he was loyal to her.</p><p>We\u2019ll see\u2026<br></p>",

He\nis grateful that she have saved them and to finally accept to help them. He\nhas sympathy for her and even a little affection, especially seeing how she\nreacts: all cute and full of hope. But NOTHING justified him\nbending the knee. None of their previous\nscene led to this.

In addition, we are talking about Jon.</p><p>In my opinion,\nJon takes a little desperately the opportunity of the situation and feelings of\nDaenerys. He is neither manipulator nor calculator. There is truth in what he\ndoes. Yes, he\u2019s sorry for her dragon. Yes, she is beautiful. Yes, she attracts\nhim and he has affection for her. Yes, now that it is official, he considers in\npart that he owes her allegiance. But no, Jon does not love her. No, he will\nnot give up his kingdom just because she has a \u201cgood heart\u201d. No, he\nwill not forget where his loyalty is.</p><p>We have seen it\nwith the Widlings: sleeping with Ygrid made Jon sure that she was faithful to\nhim against his own people, and the widlings were less suspicious of him. He\nloved Ygrid though but lied because his true allegiance was to the Night Watch.\nI think it\u2019s the same here. By ensuring the love of Daenerys, he protects his\npeople. She will be better able to listen to him so that he can better present\nher to his subjects. That\u2019s why he insists that she comes with him at\nWinterfell and not on the back of a dragon, that he tells her \u201cif we have\nto be allies in this war\u201d etc. This is an allegiance provisional to ensure\nthe good continuity of things. As for the continuation, he will see later with\nhis people, his family and Ser Davos. But it is to them that his loyalty goes.\nAnd if they decide, after meeting Daenerys, that they still want to be independent, I\ncan not see Jon denying it for them.</p><p>I will finally\nadd that I wonder if the attraction of Jon (but also Daenerys) is not also due\nto their blood Targaryen. That they feel attracted to each other but without\nknowing why. I think it\u2019s more obvious from Jon\u2019s point of view as he spends\nmost of the season focusing on the king of the night and being frustrated by\nDaenerys\u2019 rejections. Because despite all that, he is attracted by her without\nreally understanding why. And maybe with time his feelings will grow. We can already see how he has allowed himself a little more in her presence since he announced publicly that he was loyal to her.</p><p>We\u2019ll see\u2026<br></p>",

Jon\nis desperate to understand that he has fallen into a &ldquo;trap&rdquo;,\nfrustrated at not being listened to, worried about the consequences, etc. He is\nthen made a &ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; and thinks only of returning to Winterfell to\nhelp his family.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebf814fa7f8bfbacbe8a9235b8850f69/tumblr_inline_phs8yzHaIX1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Jon&rsquo;s\nsecond interaction and second attempt at approach, in a less direct and softer\nway.

During this\nexchange, for the first time Dany &amp; Jon are no longer in a strong position\nbut just 2 people discussing a threat and what to do. Jon is seen hugely\nwatching the queen, as since their second exchange. He is in observation,\nanalysis. He tries to know her, to understand her, to see her reactions to find\nHOW to change her mind.

Finally, there is the\nidea of bringing back evidence. When Jon declares that he is going to go and\nDaenerys reminds him that she is holding him back and has not given him permission,\nJon gets angry and reminds her sharply that he is king and that he does not\nneed his permission. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/16dd5d8671546e3a5518319833da3e78/tumblr_inline_phs8z5gGBw1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e093bd568f7e4eba4b0ec79b5c773056/tumblr_inline_phs8z5aNOJ1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p> Seventh\ninteraction: Here he is about to leave, he bids farewell to Daenerys the mind\nalready focused on his mission and goes away without a look back unlike Jorah.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/56737591237959fcfee8652735d6c699/tumblr_inline_phs8z6pDYL1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/08cc125dc9038ff26046c0b2617dff96/tumblr_inline_phs8z6TOh21rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab3bd0e2ce54b44b9dac82984e18b13c/tumblr_inline_phs8z62tBT1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I think it&rsquo;s\nimportant to point out that Jon, in most scenes with Daenerys where he&rsquo;s not\nreally trying to convince her (cave, meeting) or observe her (dragon), has his\ngaze fixed on the ground or towards the horizon.

As if, apart from making her an ally,\nthese conversations did not interest her.</p><p><br /></p><p>Then came the\nfamous mission, the rescue, the death of a dragon and Jon wounded.</p><p><br />\n8th:\nWhen he wakes up, after nearly dying, he finds himself face to face with Daenerys.\nThen\nstart what I call the survival mission. Jon\nsays he&rsquo;s sorry, catches the hand of the queen, says he would like to go back,\netc. He really shows his remorse. Daenerys\ndoes not blame him and, on the contrary, invests herself personally in the\nbattle. Jon\nseems enormously relieved and thanks her by using a nickname that does not seem\nto be the right one. After\na look at her and a deep breath, came the famous &ldquo;How about my queen? I will have bent my knee but &hellip;\n&rdquo; There\nis an exchange on the lords of the North and the fact that Dany hopes to be\nworthy of his allegiance. Jon, telling\nher that she is, really seems to be lying. The\nway he has to slowly lift his eyelids, to fix his gaze in a very calm manner\nand to say &ldquo;you are,&rdquo; exudes falseness. He\nis not a very good liar and there is a background of truth in his lyrics which\nmakes this moment special and compelling but not enough for those who have\nfollowed Jon for 7 seasons. His\nnew queen then asks him to rest, he closes his eyes but, as soon as she leaves,\nreopens them, turns, looks up at the ceiling and sighs deeply. This scene is not trivial.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29b68d9f531e28bda2f7a6323238dcc1/tumblr_inline_phs8z7tN1E1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83f35b95b72c4104c0e4bc6ff2f07610/tumblr_inline_phs8z8HLVb1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e87b34e7c26f72faed7e8a77073809/tumblr_inline_phs8z8nP9V1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b453e56a8a0e8131e08a09ac495dd25/tumblr_inline_phs8z8HIQg1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0f932ba8a8a86f9a8fa35add843c851/tumblr_inline_phs8z9ebL11rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b3665d468e215d6ad19ba80858b258c/tumblr_inline_phs8zaDjPL1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79084d9092a759139edb425148b14f32/tumblr_inline_phs8zav2M21rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />\nFrom\nwhat I think: Jon was afraid that Daenerys would blame him for the death of her\ndragon, seeing that she was not doing it, he was reassured but still wanted to\nbe nice to her to avoid any future change of opinion.

Yes, now that it is official, he considers in\npart that he owes her allegiance. But no, Jon does not love her. No, he will\nnot give up his kingdom just because she has a &ldquo;good heart&rdquo;. No, he\nwill not forget where his loyalty is.</p><p>We have seen it\nwith the Widlings: sleeping with Ygrid made Jon sure that she was faithful to\nhim against his own people, and the widlings were less suspicious of him. He\nloved Ygrid though but lied because his true allegiance was to the Night Watch.\nI think it&rsquo;s the same here. By ensuring the love of Daenerys, he protects his\npeople. She will be better able to listen to him so that he can better present\nher to his subjects. That&rsquo;s why he insists that she comes with him at\nWinterfell and not on the back of a dragon, that he tells her &ldquo;if we have\nto be allies in this war&rdquo; etc. This is an allegiance provisional to ensure\nthe good continuity of things. As for the continuation, he will see later with\nhis people, his family and Ser Davos. But it is to them that his loyalty goes.\nAnd if they decide, after meeting Daenerys, that they still want to be independent, I\ncan not see Jon denying it for them.</p><p>I will finally\nadd that I wonder if the attraction of Jon (but also Daenerys) is not also due\nto their blood Targaryen. That they feel attracted to each other but without\nknowing why. I think it&rsquo;s more obvious from Jon&rsquo;s point of view as he spends\nmost of the season focusing on the king of the night and being frustrated by\nDaenerys&rsquo; rejections. Because despite all that, he is attracted by her without\nreally understanding why. And maybe with time his feelings will grow. We can already see how he has allowed himself a little more in her presence since he announced publicly that he was loyal to her.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll see&hellip;<br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to go\nback to Jon&rsquo;s interactions with Daenerys in season 7 and what they show about\nJon&rsquo;s feelings.</p>\n<p>[\nEnglish is not my native language so sorry if there are mistakes.\n\n]<br /></p>\n<p><br />\nBefore\nhe left, the Lords, Lyanna &amp; Sansa told him that they could not trust a\nTargaryen and that it was a trap. Reminding\nhim at the same time of the fate of his grandfather and his uncle. Jon says he must\nstill take the risk.</p>\n<p><br />\nFirst\ninteraction with Daenerys, a strong, proud, menacing queen who orders him to\nbend the knee, not listening to his arguments. Jon\nis desperate to understand that he has fallen into a &ldquo;trap&rdquo;,\nfrustrated at not being listened to, worried about the consequences, etc. He is\nthen made a &ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; and thinks only of returning to Winterfell to\nhelp his family.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebf814fa7f8bfbacbe8a9235b8850f69/tumblr_inline_phs8yzHaIX1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Jon&rsquo;s\nsecond interaction and second attempt at approach, in a less direct and softer\nway. Daenerys\nand he still can not get along and his frustration is growing. Nevertheless,\nthe queen makes a concession by allowing him to extract the Dragon Glass and he\nis grateful to her, hoping that she finally believes him, which is unfortunately\nnot the case.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c028df76d01da9b49497fec6c57a1713/tumblr_inline_phs8z0anlZ1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/819e44d29592cf83b97a5622f93e7701/tumblr_inline_phs8z1gK4B1rsvpj6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />\nThen\nwe have a scene where Davos asks what Jon thinks of Dany. In a neutral tone he\nreplies that he thinks she has a good heart. Davos jokes that Jon looking at\nDany&rsquo;s body. To which Jon answers indifferently that he has no time for that.\nAnd Jon goes on to the king of the night and the fact that the North has too\nfew men to defend themselves. We can see that Jon have nothing wrong against\nDaenerys but he has better else to do than to think of a pretty woman.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e75802a8641a7734978378de403a2a6e/tumblr_inline_phs8z1hbLs1rsvpj6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure>\n</p>",
