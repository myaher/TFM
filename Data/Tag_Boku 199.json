P-Please!</i>&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Where are you, baby girl!?&rdquo; he growled, whipping his head around as he desperately tried to see anything or anyone.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;<i>Daddy! Help me!</i>&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>The sound echoed all around his body; her scream was loud, the sound \nresonating in his chest. His heart throbbed with anxiety, desperate to \nfind his girl.</small></p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;<i>DADDY</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>With her final scream, he turned around once again, only to see his \ndaughter completely trapped in a pile of sludge. He felt his breath \nleave his lungs as he watched her desperately struggle to escape. His \neyes trailed up the creature&rsquo;s body, and he met with a familiar face, \none he worked so hard to forget.</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; she screamed, her tiny hand reaching for him as she seemed \nto move farther and farther away, the sludge pulling her hand back.</p><p>&ldquo;SAYURI!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;You fucking piece of shit! Stay away from \nher!&rdquo; Explosions blasted from his hands, propelling him immediately \nforward.</p><p>He would reach her. He would save her.</p><p>&ldquo;I bet you thought I was long gone&hellip; a small stain on your memory. \nBut when I heard your beautiful little girl was quirkless, well&hellip; I had\n to come see for myself.&rdquo; A large tentacle of sludge traveled up her \ncheek.</p><p>His explosions sputtered to a stop as he fell to the ground, staring \nat the scene still moving away from him. Why did it keep pulling back \nthe closer Katsuki got?</p><p>&ldquo;D-Dadd-&rdquo; The sludge monster was quick to cut her off, covering her \nmouth with his body, his sludge lips opening up to show his \ndevil-looking teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Shh. Hush. There&rsquo;s no need to be scared, your daddy is going to save\n you.&rdquo; He spat the words, his lips moving as if his mouth belonged to \nher. &ldquo;Save me, Ground Zero!&rdquo; he teased, laughing</p><p>&ldquo;Fight it, baby girl!&rdquo; he screamed, pain shooting up his arms, \nmuscles trembling, tendons stripping away under his skin. He couldn&rsquo;t \nmaintain this for much longer, his explosions were going to die out.</p><p>A muffled scream erupted against the sludge and her round, brown eyes slammed shut as she struggled against the creature.</p><p>&ldquo;You remember how this feels, don&rsquo;t you, Bakugou Katsuki?&rdquo; the monster laughed. &ldquo;Feeling <i>useless</i>, unable to move or use your quirk. She has no quirk! No way to fight. Will you save her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I fucking will!&rdquo; he yelled. His arms trembled as he \ndesperately tried to push himself up. His hands were screaming in pain. \nThere was no way he had enough sweat to get to her, not with how much he\n used and with how fast the sludge monster kept pulling her back away \nfrom him&hellip;</p><p>No. Bakugou Katsuki didn&rsquo;t give up. No matter what.</p><p>His red eyes met her browns, her pupils blown wide as tears streamed down her cheeks. He could almost hear her voice.</p><p>&rsquo;<i>Daddy, I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;</i>&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered, a burst of sweat igniting against his palms as he flew forward, his arms feeling broken under his uniform.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for his explosions to give out, his hands feeling\n dry as he tumbled to the ground. His body slammed into the concrete, \nhitting its physical limit. &ldquo;SAYURI!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ground Zero? Number one hero? Can&rsquo;t even save his own daughter?&rdquo; The sludge villain cackled, keeping her eyes uncovered.</p><p>&ldquo;How pathetic! Where&rsquo;s Deku? He could save her. Better call for <i>help</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; he yelled. He placed his palms flat on the ground, pushing his head up as he tried to reach for her &ldquo;SAYURI!&rdquo;</p><p>The sludge monster spread out his tendrils, wrapping Katsuki in \ndarkness, his body barely able to move as the darkness enveloped him \ncompletely.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>&hellip;suki&hellip;</i>&rdquo;</p><p>There was a voice in the distance and he struggled against the \nsludge. It had to be Sayuri. She was crying out to him, lost in the mass\n of sludge which overtook both of them.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Katsuki</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>No&hellip; not Sayuri.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>KATSUKI</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>He let out a gasp as he eyes shot open.</p><p>Staring down at him with concern was his goddamn beautiful wife. Her \neyes were wide, looking over his body, as if to check for an injury.</p><p>&ldquo;O-Ochako&hellip;&rdquo; he breathed, his chest heaving. Sweat dripped down his \nforehead and arms, his palms covered in it. &ldquo;A dream&hellip;&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>Ochako immediately frowned, puffing out her round cheeks. &ldquo;More like a\n nightmare! You kicked me multiple times and you were flailing all \nabout. You yelled out too, though I couldn&rsquo;t really understand you,&rdquo; she\n sighed, rubbing her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted, letting his head flop back against the pillow.</p><p>His wife let out a yawn, and slowly sank down underneath the covers \nwith him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sweating so much I&rsquo;m tempted to have you take a \nshower,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fuckin&rsquo; fine!&rdquo; he hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not. What happened?&rdquo; Her fingers gently brushed his blond \nbangs away from his forehead. He could feel the soft pads touch his \nsmooth skin, a sensation he was more than used to over the years.</p><p>&ldquo;Sayuri&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Katsuki,&rdquo; she sighed, resting her arm over his shoulder. &ldquo;Is this about the press conference?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fuckin&rsquo; know, Ochako,&rdquo; he hissed, turning away from his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me&hellip;&rdquo; she urged, leaning forward to press her lips against the side of his.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;the sludge villain&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sludge villain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;from when I was a kid&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Sayuri was captured by him and I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki&hellip;&rdquo; she said. Her fingers slipped across his chin and slowly\n turned his face to meet hers. Her brown eyes were warm, even though he \nhad just spent all night battling his pillow and kicking her.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was just a dream,&rdquo; she said, pressing their lips together. &ldquo;You \nknow if Sayu was ever kidnapped we would go after her immediately, and \nso would Deku, Shouto, Momo, Eijirou&hellip; all our friends&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t fucking save her,&rdquo; he snapped, pressing\n his hand over his eyes. &ldquo;And everyone is going to know tomorrow&hellip; <i>everyone</i>! Do you know what that fucking means, Ochako?&rdquo;</p><p>Her fingers pressed against his own, pulling his hand away from his \neyes. &ldquo;I do. It leaves us vulnerable. But we can&rsquo;t hide it forever. \nSooner or later someone is going to find out, someone who will out us to\n the press anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just hate that it has to turn into this&hellip; this goddamn <i>thing</i> because of who we are&hellip;&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;And who knows who will try and get to us through her&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We just&hellip; have to have faith we&rsquo;re better than whoever that may be and we&rsquo;ll stop them before they ever even <i>see</i> our baby,&rdquo; Ochako spoke with such strong determination, and Katsuki sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re stronger than them!&rdquo; he snarled.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. So&hellip; nothing to worry about,&rdquo; she said, yawning as she rest her head on his chest.</p><p>Katsuki sighed, stroking his fingers through her hair. Even on humid \nnights like this, her hair was so soft and his fingertips brushed \nthrough it with ease. &ldquo;Ochako&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Are you really not \nworried?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; she turned her head up to stare at him. Her hair fell over her \ncheek as she let out a soft sigh. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m worried&hellip;&rdquo; she said \nquietly. &ldquo;But this is your daughter we&rsquo;re talking about. Sayuri is \nincredibly strong, and I know you aren&rsquo;t going to let anyone touch a \nhair on her cute blonde head,&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn right&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;I have faith in you and her,&rdquo; she whispered, nuzzling her cheek against his bare chest.</p><p>Katsuki did have faith in his daughter. He had faith in his wife \ntoo&hellip; he wanted to have faith in himself and the rest of this goddamn \nsociety, but his eyes stayed open, his mind running through the various \ninsults he called Deku over the years.</p><p>~~</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; I don&rsquo;t wanna!&rdquo; Sayuri whined, stomping her foot against the ground.</p><p>Katsuki knelt down, helping her unzip her jacket. &ldquo;Look, I get it. I \nwouldn&rsquo;t want to spend all day at Half &amp; Half&rsquo;s house either, but \nMommy and Daddy got some real important stuff to do okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She puffed up her cheeks. &ldquo;Shouhei and the twins are mean to me!&rdquo; she said, folding her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;No we&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; Shouhei was quick to retort. &ldquo;She just gets pissy when things don&rsquo;t go her way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! Language!&rdquo; Katsuki hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;Says <i>you</i>,&rdquo; Shouhei snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; Ochako growled. &ldquo;Enough! Now, Sayuri&hellip; Shouhei&hellip; be on your best behavior for Momo and Shouto, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Ochako, Shouto and I are more than capable of handling \nthe children,&rdquo; Momo smiled, gently placing her hand on her friend&rsquo;s \nshoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not you and Shouto I&rsquo;m worried about,&rdquo; she sighed, shaking her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Shou-kun!&rdquo; Arata, one of the Todoroki twins, came zipping around the corner, practically sliding into the wall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Shou-kun, hi Sayuri-chan,&rdquo; Yuuta, the other twin, smiled and \nwaved, assuming his normal position directly next to his mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys!&rdquo; Shouhei said, cheering up almost immediately upon seeing the the other boys.</p><p>Arata leaned forward, placing his hands on his hips. &ldquo;Guess who got the new Mario Kart!&rdquo;</p><p>Shouhei&rsquo;s eyes immediately lit up. &ldquo;No way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup! I&rsquo;m going to kick your butt!&rdquo; Arata pointed at Shouhei and immediately began to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; Shouhei smirked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you try!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually&hellip; normally, I&rsquo;m the one who wins&hellip;&rdquo; Yuuta spoke quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Yuu!&rdquo; Arata snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; Momo was quick to scold them. &ldquo;Please play nicely together or I&rsquo;ll take the game away. Do <i>not</i> tell your brother to &lsquo;shut up&rsquo; Arata!&rdquo;</p><p>The boy recoiled, his red and black hair covering his dark eyes. &ldquo;Okay, okay, I won&rsquo;t. Can we go play now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apologize,&rdquo; Momo said.</p><p>Arata sighed and folded his small arms across his chest. &ldquo;Sorry Yuu&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled, his tiny cheeks flushing bright red.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Arata,&rdquo; Yuuta smiled and reached his hand towards his brother. &ldquo;Should we go play now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Arata smirked. &ldquo;We gotta beat Shouhei!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>The three boys dashed off down the hall, heading towards the entertainment room.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! Don&rsquo;t run&hellip;&rdquo; Katsuki called after them but immediately rolled \nhis eyes. &ldquo;Brats&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered and turned to Sayuri. &ldquo;You can go play \ntoo if you want, baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna play with them&hellip; boys are stupid!&rdquo; she said, and stuck her tongue out at Katsuki.</p><p>&ldquo;My girl makes a good argument!&rdquo; Ochako giggled.</p><p>Momo covered her mouth as she began to laugh and knelt down in front \nof her. &ldquo;Hello Sayu-chan,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;How about me and you make some \ncookies and then we can read a story together while they bake?&rdquo;</p><p>Sayuri&rsquo;s eyes immediately lit up at the mention of cookies; she \ncertainly had her mother&rsquo;s sweet tooth. &ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; she cheered, and Momo \nlifted the small girl up to hold her against her hip.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have fun,&rdquo; Momo smiled. &ldquo;Shouto will be home soon to distract the boys I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Momo-chan,&rdquo; Ochako smiled, bowing her head. &ldquo;We&hellip; hopefully won&rsquo;t take a long time.</p><p>&quot;Be good, baby girl,&rdquo; Katsuki smiled, ruffling her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I will, Daddy!&rdquo;</p><p>Katsuki kissed his girl on the cheek before leaving her in the care \nof the Todoroki&rsquo;s. Shouto and Momo and Deku and Melissa were their go-to\n babysitters, but since Melissa and Deku were going to be at the press \nconference for support, Momo offered to watch the children</p><p>Katsuki made his way to the car, jingling the keys in his hand. &ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; he asked, looking at his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I am.&rdquo;</p><p>~~</p><p>Ochako stood in front of the podium, her hands folding over the edge.\n Cameras already began to flash in their faces, a small crowd of \nreporters and civilians gathered to watch.</p><p>Slipping a finger under his mask, Katsuki rubbed his face. His skin \nfelt hot, like he could pass out from how fucking heavy his goddamn \ncostume was.</p><p>Katsuki knew it was best to leave this part to her. As high as his \nhero ranking was, Katsuki was known for his outrageous bursts of anger \nand his inability to communicate with the press well.</p><p>This was their second time doing this, and it still didn&rsquo;t feel \ncomfortable. Katsuki supposed it never would. Of course, Shouhei&rsquo;s \nconference was a little different, since Ochako explained how his quirk \nworked and Katsuki simply yelled into the mic about how strong his son \nwas going to be.</p><p>Damn straight he was going to say the same shit again.</p><p>Ochako took a deep breath, her eyes fluttering shut and Katsuki could\n see every part of her slowly coming together, composing herself. All \nher floating thoughts and emotions pulled tight to her chest and she \nopened her mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she said, her voice echoing into the microphone. &ldquo;It is&hellip; \ngood to see you all here today. As most of you are aware, I am Uravity \nand this is my husband, Ground Zero. We called together this press \nconference to talk about our daughter.</p><p>&quot;Admittedly, it is a bit strange to me&hellip; the idea of telling the \nworld of such a private matter publicly, but I know&hellip; it is something \nwe cannot avoid. It is our job to keep this city safe&hellip; it is our job \nto rescue those in need and stop villains from ruining the peace we&rsquo;ve \nall worked so hard to create. What my child has to do with that is&hellip; a \nlittle beyond me.&rdquo; Ochako laughed and Katsuki could hear the way her \nvoice trembled, tears threatening to pour over the edge. He stepped \ncloser to her, gently placing his hand over hers on the side of the \npodium.</p><p>&ldquo;However, I know the longer we avoid talking about it, the more \nrumors spread, which are arguably, worse than discussing my family \npublicly like this.&rdquo;</p><p>She took another deep breath, and Katsuki squeezed her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;We have come here to announce our daughter&rsquo;s quirk,&rdquo; Ochako said. &ldquo;Many people have been speculating, since we haven&rsquo;t done <i>this</i> yet. Yes, I know this may come as a shock to you, but pro-heroes do occasionally read the internet!&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>Ochako was so much better at talking to the public than he was. If it\n was him&hellip; he would&rsquo;ve grabbed the goddamn mic and screamed 'she&rsquo;s \nquirkless!&rsquo; into it loudly for them all to hear and get over it.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, this is probably will make sense given our secrecy at first, but our daughter is quirkless.&rdquo;</p><p>The crowd let out a gasp, murmurs trickling through the various \ngroups of people. &ldquo;OI!&rdquo; Katsuki said, slamming his hand down against the\n podium. &ldquo;Listen to my goddamn wife!&rdquo;</p><p>He was certain he saw the crowd collectively blink, turning their \nattention back to Ochako. &ldquo;Thank you, Ground Zero,&rdquo; she smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure all of you are wondering why this is, because at first we \nwere too. It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, right?&rdquo; Ochako continued. &ldquo;Uravity\n and Ground Zero have such strong quirks! Why would their child be \nquirkless?!&rdquo; She spoke using various voices as if to play the role of \nmultiple reporters.</p><p>&ldquo;The truth is, we don&rsquo;t know. I guess we both have genes that can \nresult in quirklessness!&rdquo; Ochako shrugged. &ldquo;The important thing is&hellip; we\n <i>love</i> our daughter, with all our hearts. She&rsquo;s incredibly smart \nand she has lots of energy and she&rsquo;s healthy. Ground Zero and I do not \ncare if she does not have a quirk. To us, she is the most perfect little\n girl and I know she&rsquo;s going to grow into a perfect young woman,&rdquo; Ochako\n smiled.</p><p>Katsuki swallowed the lump forming in his throat, his fingers curling\n around her wrist. He wanted to scream at all of them. None of this \nmattered! Sayuri was the same, quirk or no quirk. She was his precious \nbaby girl, and nothing would ever change that.</p><p>He would work to make the world see that.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; well aware of how society views people who are quirkless. One of my best friends is quirkless, and <i>she</i>\n is by far one of the hardest working, most intelligent people I know. \nShe has built so much technology and changed the world of pro-heroes! \nAnd I believe that my daughter can do the same&hellip; if she wants. Whatever\n she chooses to do, Ground Zero and I are going to support her 100%, and\n we only hope society will do the same.&rdquo;</p><p>For a brief moment, his red eyes met Melissa&rsquo;s, who stood directly in front. She nodded once, her hand wrapping around Deku&rsquo;s.</p><p>Clutching her wrist, Katsuki could resist himself no longer. He loved his girl and he needed the world to know&hellip; he needed <i>her</i>\n to know&hellip; what if she watched this broadcast later on in her life? \nKatsuki wanted to be fucking proud of what he said. He yanked the \nmicrophone from the stand. &ldquo;If people are rude to her, I&rsquo;ll come kick \ntheir asses!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Hell, I&rsquo;ll teach her how to kick their asses \nso she can do it her goddamn self. She&rsquo;s a fucking champion!&rdquo; he snarled\n into the mic. &ldquo;And&hellip; we love her.&rdquo;</p><p>Ochako bit her lip, trying her best not to erupt with a emotions. Her\n lips were curling into a smile but her eyes were wet with tears \nthreatening to fall. She gently pulled the microphone from his</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything else needs to be said. Thank you,&rdquo; Ochako \nnodded, bowing to the press as they both exited the small stage.</p><p>Once the audience could no longer see them, Ochako leaped into \nKatuski&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Sometimes I think you&rsquo;re an absolute idiot, and \nsometimes you are absolutely perfect, Bakugou Katsuki.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfect all the damn time, what the hell are you talking about!?&rdquo; he snapped, and pressed their lips together.</p><p>&ldquo;I was surprised you decided to talk after all!&rdquo; she whispered, \ncupping his cheeks. She pushed his dark mask up, her thumbs brushing \nover his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah well&hellip; I wanted her to know we&rsquo;re proud of her. So if she ever watches this back&hellip; she can be proud of what we <i>both</i> said&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled.</p><p>Ochako couldn&rsquo;t help but giggle. &ldquo;Perfect father,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Best fuckin&rsquo; mother of all time,&rdquo; he retorted, nipping her lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Should we&hellip; go get our babies?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s time we went home and put all this behind us.&rdquo;</p><p>~~</p><p>The second Ochako spoke the word 'quirkless&rsquo; the news of their \ndaughter spread through the internet like a wildfire. Katsuki expected \nit, they both did, and they both chose to avoid it. The news would \ncirculate for a few days before the next big thing happened, and \nhopefully it would all be forgotten and they could move on with their \nlives.</p><p>Ochako thanked Momo and Shouto for watching the kids, and on the \ndrive home, Shouhei talked enthusiastically about beating Arata and \nYuuta at Mario Kart, while Sayuri whined about being stuffed from eating\n far too many cookies.</p><p>Once they were home, Shouhei argued about doing his homework and Sayuri fought with him about going to bed.</p><p>It felt normal.</p><p>&ldquo;But Daddy,&rdquo; she whined even after being tucked into bed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not \neven tired! See?&rdquo; She used her fingers to spread her brown eyes wide. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so awake!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;'Course you&rsquo;re awake when you hold your damn eyes open!&rdquo; he snorted.</p><p>She gasped and covered her mouth, her small finger pointing at him. &ldquo;Daddy! Swear jar!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay&hellip; I&rsquo;ll put a coin in!&rdquo; he scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Cha-ching!&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;If I do that&hellip; do you think you can go to bed for me?&rdquo; he asked, a smirk pulling across his lips.</p><p>She yawned and shrugged. &ldquo;I'unno&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled.</p><p>Katsuki couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle. &ldquo;Oh really? I think your yawn says otherwise. You had a long day, baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess&hellip;&rdquo; she whined, her eyes fluttering shut. &ldquo;Kiss, Daddy!&rdquo; she demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Good night, baby girl,&rdquo; he said softly. His hand stroked across her \ntiny forehead, smoothing her blonde hair back. &ldquo;No matter what happens,&rdquo;\n he whispered. &ldquo;I will always protect you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;Daddy is the number one hero! Ground Zero!&rdquo; she cheered sleepily.</p><p>She was perfect. An absolute angel. She could have&hellip; negative quirks\n and he would still love this damn kid with all his fucking heart. He \nloved both of his kids so freaking much, more than he thought he could \nlove anyone. Ochako was up there on the list too.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn right I am!&rdquo; he laughed, and kissed her forehead again.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the swear jar&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled, her tiny lips parting as she slowly drifted off to sleep.</p><p>He sat with her for a moment, watching her sleep, her tiny body \nmoving with her breath. He was going to do whatever it took to keep her \nsafe&hellip; to protect her from the awful words people might say\u2026 from the \nterrible things they might do&hellip; And he and Ochako would teach her to be\n the best fucking fighter this world had ever seen. She wouldn&rsquo;t need a \ndamn quirk to kick ass.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise&hellip; baby girl&hellip; I promise to always protect you&hellip;&rdquo; he \nwhispered to his sleeping daughter. He wanted her life to always feel \nthis peaceful.</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki?&rdquo; Ochako whispered, peering in through the crack in the door. &ldquo;Is she asleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted, giving her one small kiss before he stood up, heading to the door. &ldquo;Was just sayin&rsquo; goodnight&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Ochako smiled gently and cupped his cheek. &ldquo;I know it was an emotional day for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Katsuki pursed his lips, looking at his girl. &ldquo;Y'know&hellip; I fought so \ndamn hard, dealt with so much fuckin&rsquo; anger all because I wanted to be \nnumber one&hellip; and come to find out it didn&rsquo;t really matter that much. \nI&rsquo;m number one to them, and to you, and that&rsquo;s the most important \ngoddamn thing,&rdquo; he said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;You are!&rdquo; Ochako giggled, leaning up to peck his cheek. &ldquo;My number one man, and number one dad.&rdquo;</p><p>He slipped his fingers against hers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what it takes&hellip;&rdquo; \nhe said. &ldquo;I will keep her safe. I will keep her safe and Shou and you&hellip;\n though I have a feeling you&rsquo;re gonna say you plan on helping me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We <i>do</i> make an amazing team,&rdquo; she laughed, wrapping her arm around his waist, rocking back and forth on her feet.</p><p>&ldquo;We sure as hell do, Cheeks,&rdquo; he said, kissing her softly. &ldquo;We make amazing kids too. We should make more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki, please!&rdquo; she giggled, and gently pushed his chest. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I fucking love you too..&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Swear jar!&rdquo; she teased, kissing him once more.</p><p>&ldquo;I owe it four coins or some bullshit. Five&hellip; I guess now&hellip;&rdquo; he snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a real tab going on that thing.

He felt his breath \nleave his lungs as he watched her desperately struggle to escape. His \neyes trailed up the creature\u2019s body, and he met with a familiar face, \none he worked so hard to forget.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d she screamed, her tiny hand reaching for him as she seemed \nto move farther and farther away, the sludge pulling her hand back.</p><p>\u201cSAYURI!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou fucking piece of shit! Stay away from \nher!\u201d Explosions blasted from his hands, propelling him immediately \nforward.</p><p>He would reach her. He would save her.</p><p>\u201cI bet you thought I was long gone\u2026 a small stain on your memory. \nBut when I heard your beautiful little girl was quirkless, well\u2026 I had\n to come see for myself.\u201d A large tentacle of sludge traveled up her \ncheek.</p><p>His explosions sputtered to a stop as he fell to the ground, staring \nat the scene still moving away from him. Why did it keep pulling back \nthe closer Katsuki got?</p><p>\u201cD-Dadd-\u201d The sludge monster was quick to cut her off, covering her \nmouth with his body, his sludge lips opening up to show his \ndevil-looking teeth.</p><p>\u201cShh. Hush. There\u2019s no need to be scared, your daddy is going to save\n you.\u201d He spat the words, his lips moving as if his mouth belonged to \nher. \u201cSave me, Ground Zero!\u201d he teased, laughing</p><p>\u201cFight it, baby girl!\u201d he screamed, pain shooting up his arms, \nmuscles trembling, tendons stripping away under his skin. He couldn\u2019t \nmaintain this for much longer, his explosions were going to die out.</p><p>A muffled scream erupted against the sludge and her round, brown eyes slammed shut as she struggled against the creature.</p><p>\u201cYou remember how this feels, don\u2019t you, Bakugou Katsuki?\u201d the monster laughed. \u201cFeeling <i>useless</i>, unable to move or use your quirk. She has no quirk! No way to fight. Will you save her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I fucking will!\u201d he yelled. His arms trembled as he \ndesperately tried to push himself up. His hands were screaming in pain. \nThere was no way he had enough sweat to get to her, not with how much he\n used and with how fast the sludge monster kept pulling her back away \nfrom him\u2026</p><p>No. Bakugou Katsuki didn\u2019t give up. No matter what.</p><p>His red eyes met her browns, her pupils blown wide as tears streamed down her cheeks. He could almost hear her voice.</p><p>\u2019<i>Daddy, I\u2019m sorry\u2026</i>\u2019</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d he whispered, a burst of sweat igniting against his palms as he flew forward, his arms feeling broken under his uniform.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for his explosions to give out, his hands feeling\n dry as he tumbled to the ground. His body slammed into the concrete, \nhitting its physical limit. \u201cSAYURI!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGround Zero? Number one hero? Can\u2019t even save his own daughter?\u201d The sludge villain cackled, keeping her eyes uncovered.</p><p>\u201cHow pathetic! Where\u2019s Deku? He could save her. Better call for <i>help</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d he yelled. He placed his palms flat on the ground, pushing his head up as he tried to reach for her \u201cSAYURI!\u201d</p><p>The sludge monster spread out his tendrils, wrapping Katsuki in \ndarkness, his body barely able to move as the darkness enveloped him \ncompletely.</p><p>\u201c<i>\u2026suki\u2026</i>\u201d</p><p>There was a voice in the distance and he struggled against the \nsludge. It had to be Sayuri. She was crying out to him, lost in the mass\n of sludge which overtook both of them.</p><p>\u201c<i>Katsuki</i>!\u201d</p><p>No\u2026 not Sayuri.</p><p>\u201c<i>KATSUKI</i>!\u201d</p><p>He let out a gasp as he eyes shot open.</p><p>Staring down at him with concern was his goddamn beautiful wife. Her \neyes were wide, looking over his body, as if to check for an injury.</p><p>\u201cO-Ochako\u2026\u201d he breathed, his chest heaving. Sweat dripped down his \nforehead and arms, his palms covered in it. \u201cA dream\u2026\u201d he growled.</p><p>Ochako immediately frowned, puffing out her round cheeks. \u201cMore like a\n nightmare! You kicked me multiple times and you were flailing all \nabout. You yelled out too, though I couldn\u2019t really understand you,\u201d she\n sighed, rubbing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he grunted, letting his head flop back against the pillow.</p><p>His wife let out a yawn, and slowly sank down underneath the covers \nwith him. \u201cYou\u2019re sweating so much I\u2019m tempted to have you take a \nshower,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 fine!\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. What happened?\u201d Her fingers gently brushed his blond \nbangs away from his forehead. He could feel the soft pads touch his \nsmooth skin, a sensation he was more than used to over the years.</p><p>\u201cSayuri\u2026\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh Katsuki,\u201d she sighed, resting her arm over his shoulder. \u201cIs this about the press conference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 know, Ochako,\u201d he hissed, turning away from his wife.</p><p>\u201cTell me\u2026\u201d she urged, leaning forward to press her lips against the side of his.</p><p>\u201c\u2026the sludge villain\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sludge villain?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026from when I was a kid\u2026\u201d he grunted. \u201cSayuri was captured by him and I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d she said. Her fingers slipped across his chin and slowly\n turned his face to meet hers. Her brown eyes were warm, even though he \nhad just spent all night battling his pillow and kicking her.</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a dream,\u201d she said, pressing their lips together. \u201cYou \nknow if Sayu was ever kidnapped we would go after her immediately, and \nso would Deku, Shouto, Momo, Eijirou\u2026 all our friends\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t fucking save her,\u201d he snapped, pressing\n his hand over his eyes. \u201cAnd everyone is going to know tomorrow\u2026 <i>everyone</i>! Do you know what that fucking means, Ochako?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers pressed against his own, pulling his hand away from his \neyes. \u201cI do. It leaves us vulnerable. But we can\u2019t hide it forever. \nSooner or later someone is going to find out, someone who will out us to\n the press anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hate that it has to turn into this\u2026 this goddamn <i>thing</i> because of who we are\u2026\u201d he scoffed. \u201cAnd who knows who will try and get to us through her\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just\u2026 have to have faith we\u2019re better than whoever that may be and we\u2019ll stop them before they ever even <i>see</i> our baby,\u201d Ochako spoke with such strong determination, and Katsuki sighed.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re stronger than them!\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cExactly. So\u2026 nothing to worry about,\u201d she said, yawning as she rest her head on his chest.</p><p>Katsuki sighed, stroking his fingers through her hair. Even on humid \nnights like this, her hair was so soft and his fingertips brushed \nthrough it with ease. \u201cOchako\u2026\u201d he muttered. \u201cAre you really not \nworried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d she turned her head up to stare at him. Her hair fell over her \ncheek as she let out a soft sigh. \u201cOf course I\u2019m worried\u2026\u201d she said \nquietly. \u201cBut this is your daughter we\u2019re talking about. Sayuri is \nincredibly strong, and I know you aren\u2019t going to let anyone touch a \nhair on her cute blonde head,\u201d she giggled.</p><p>\u201cDamn right\u2026\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI have faith in you and her,\u201d she whispered, nuzzling her cheek against his bare chest.</p><p>Katsuki did have faith in his daughter. He had faith in his wife \ntoo\u2026 he wanted to have faith in himself and the rest of this goddamn \nsociety, but his eyes stayed open, his mind running through the various \ninsults he called Deku over the years.</p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna!\u201d Sayuri whined, stomping her foot against the ground.</p><p>Katsuki knelt down, helping her unzip her jacket. \u201cLook, I get it. I \nwouldn\u2019t want to spend all day at Half &amp; Half\u2019s house either, but \nMommy and Daddy got some real important stuff to do okay?\u201d</p><p>She puffed up her cheeks. \u201cShouhei and the twins are mean to me!\u201d she said, folding her arms.</p><p>\u201cNo we\u2019re not!\u201d Shouhei was quick to retort. \u201cShe just gets pissy when things don\u2019t go her way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi! Language!\u201d Katsuki hissed.</p><p>\u201cSays <i>you</i>,\u201d Shouhei snapped.</p><p>\u201cBoys!\u201d Ochako growled. \u201cEnough! Now, Sayuri\u2026 Shouhei\u2026 be on your best behavior for Momo and Shouto, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Ochako, Shouto and I are more than capable of handling \nthe children,\u201d Momo smiled, gently placing her hand on her friend\u2019s \nshoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not you and Shouto I\u2019m worried about,\u201d she sighed, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cShou-kun!\u201d Arata, one of the Todoroki twins, came zipping around the corner, practically sliding into the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Shou-kun, hi Sayuri-chan,\u201d Yuuta, the other twin, smiled and \nwaved, assuming his normal position directly next to his mother.</p><p>\u201cHey guys!\u201d Shouhei said, cheering up almost immediately upon seeing the the other boys.</p><p>Arata leaned forward, placing his hands on his hips. \u201cGuess who got the new Mario Kart!\u201d</p><p>Shouhei\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup! I\u2019m going to kick your butt!\u201d Arata pointed at Shouhei and immediately began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Shouhei smirked. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 normally, I\u2019m the one who wins\u2026\u201d Yuuta spoke quietly.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Yuu!\u201d Arata snapped.</p><p>\u201cBoys!\u201d Momo was quick to scold them. \u201cPlease play nicely together or I\u2019ll take the game away. Do <i>not</i> tell your brother to \u2018shut up\u2019 Arata!\u201d</p><p>The boy recoiled, his red and black hair covering his dark eyes. \u201cOkay, okay, I won\u2019t. Can we go play now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize,\u201d Momo said.</p><p>Arata sighed and folded his small arms across his chest. \u201cSorry Yuu\u2026\u201d he grumbled, his tiny cheeks flushing bright red.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Arata,\u201d Yuuta smiled and reached his hand towards his brother. \u201cShould we go play now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Arata smirked. \u201cWe gotta beat Shouhei!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>The three boys dashed off down the hall, heading towards the entertainment room.</p><p>\u201cOi! Don\u2019t run\u2026\u201d Katsuki called after them but immediately rolled \nhis eyes. \u201cBrats\u2026\u201d he muttered and turned to Sayuri. \u201cYou can go play \ntoo if you want, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna play with them\u2026 boys are stupid!\u201d she said, and stuck her tongue out at Katsuki.</p><p>\u201cMy girl makes a good argument!\u201d Ochako giggled.</p><p>Momo covered her mouth as she began to laugh and knelt down in front \nof her. \u201cHello Sayu-chan,\u201d she smiled. \u201cHow about me and you make some \ncookies and then we can read a story together while they bake?\u201d</p><p>Sayuri\u2019s eyes immediately lit up at the mention of cookies; she \ncertainly had her mother\u2019s sweet tooth. \u201cOkay!\u201d she cheered, and Momo \nlifted the small girl up to hold her against her hip.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have fun,\u201d Momo smiled. \u201cShouto will be home soon to distract the boys I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Momo-chan,\u201d Ochako smiled, bowing her head. \u201cWe\u2026 hopefully won\u2019t take a long time.</p><p>\"Be good, baby girl,\u201d Katsuki smiled, ruffling her hair.</p><p>\u201cI will, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>Katsuki kissed his girl on the cheek before leaving her in the care \nof the Todoroki\u2019s. Shouto and Momo and Deku and Melissa were their go-to\n babysitters, but since Melissa and Deku were going to be at the press \nconference for support, Momo offered to watch the children</p><p>Katsuki made his way to the car, jingling the keys in his hand. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked, looking at his wife.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>Ochako stood in front of the podium, her hands folding over the edge.\n Cameras already began to flash in their faces, a small crowd of \nreporters and civilians gathered to watch.</p><p>Slipping a finger under his mask, Katsuki rubbed his face. His skin \nfelt hot, like he could pass out from how fucking heavy his goddamn \ncostume was.</p><p>Katsuki knew it was best to leave this part to her. As high as his \nhero ranking was, Katsuki was known for his outrageous bursts of anger \nand his inability to communicate with the press well.</p><p>This was their second time doing this, and it still didn\u2019t feel \ncomfortable. Katsuki supposed it never would. Of course, Shouhei\u2019s \nconference was a little different, since Ochako explained how his quirk \nworked and Katsuki simply yelled into the mic about how strong his son \nwas going to be.</p><p>Damn straight he was going to say the same shit again.</p><p>Ochako took a deep breath, her eyes fluttering shut and Katsuki could\n see every part of her slowly coming together, composing herself. All \nher floating thoughts and emotions pulled tight to her chest and she \nopened her mouth to speak.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d she said, her voice echoing into the microphone. \u201cIt is\u2026 \ngood to see you all here today. As most of you are aware, I am Uravity \nand this is my husband, Ground Zero. We called together this press \nconference to talk about our daughter.</p><p>\"Admittedly, it is a bit strange to me\u2026 the idea of telling the \nworld of such a private matter publicly, but I know\u2026 it is something \nwe cannot avoid. It is our job to keep this city safe\u2026 it is our job \nto rescue those in need and stop villains from ruining the peace we\u2019ve \nall worked so hard to create. What my child has to do with that is\u2026 a \nlittle beyond me.\u201d Ochako laughed and Katsuki could hear the way her \nvoice trembled, tears threatening to pour over the edge. He stepped \ncloser to her, gently placing his hand over hers on the side of the \npodium.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I know the longer we avoid talking about it, the more \nrumors spread, which are arguably, worse than discussing my family \npublicly like this.\u201d</p><p>She took another deep breath, and Katsuki squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cWe have come here to announce our daughter\u2019s quirk,\u201d Ochako said. \u201cMany people have been speculating, since we haven\u2019t done <i>this</i> yet. Yes, I know this may come as a shock to you, but pro-heroes do occasionally read the internet!\u201d she giggled.</p><p>Ochako was so much better at talking to the public than he was. If it\n was him\u2026 he would\u2019ve grabbed the goddamn mic and screamed 'she\u2019s \nquirkless!\u2019 into it loudly for them all to hear and get over it.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, this is probably will make sense given our secrecy at first, but our daughter is quirkless.\u201d</p><p>The crowd let out a gasp, murmurs trickling through the various \ngroups of people. \u201cOI!\u201d Katsuki said, slamming his hand down against the\n podium. \u201cListen to my goddamn wife!\u201d</p><p>He was certain he saw the crowd collectively blink, turning their \nattention back to Ochako. \u201cThank you, Ground Zero,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure all of you are wondering why this is, because at first we \nwere too. It doesn\u2019t make much sense, right?\u201d Ochako continued. \u201cUravity\n and Ground Zero have such strong quirks! Why would their child be \nquirkless?!\u201d She spoke using various voices as if to play the role of \nmultiple reporters.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t know. I guess we both have genes that can \nresult in quirklessness!\u201d Ochako shrugged. \u201cThe important thing is\u2026 we\n <i>love</i> our daughter, with all our hearts. She\u2019s incredibly smart \nand she has lots of energy and she\u2019s healthy. Ground Zero and I do not \ncare if she does not have a quirk. To us, she is the most perfect little\n girl and I know she\u2019s going to grow into a perfect young woman,\u201d Ochako\n smiled.</p><p>Katsuki swallowed the lump forming in his throat, his fingers curling\n around her wrist. He wanted to scream at all of them. None of this \nmattered! Sayuri was the same, quirk or no quirk. She was his precious \nbaby girl, and nothing would ever change that.</p><p>He would work to make the world see that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 well aware of how society views people who are quirkless. One of my best friends is quirkless, and <i>she</i>\n is by far one of the hardest working, most intelligent people I know. \nShe has built so much technology and changed the world of pro-heroes! \nAnd I believe that my daughter can do the same\u2026 if she wants. Whatever\n she chooses to do, Ground Zero and I are going to support her 100%, and\n we only hope society will do the same.\u201d</p><p>For a brief moment, his red eyes met Melissa\u2019s, who stood directly in front. She nodded once, her hand wrapping around Deku\u2019s.</p><p>Clutching her wrist, Katsuki could resist himself no longer. He loved his girl and he needed the world to know\u2026 he needed <i>her</i>\n to know\u2026 what if she watched this broadcast later on in her life? \nKatsuki wanted to be fucking proud of what he said. He yanked the \nmicrophone from the stand. \u201cIf people are rude to her, I\u2019ll come kick \ntheir asses!\u201d he snapped. \u201cHell, I\u2019ll teach her how to kick their asses \nso she can do it her goddamn self. She\u2019s a fucking champion!\u201d he snarled\n into the mic. \u201cAnd\u2026 we love her.\u201d</p><p>Ochako bit her lip, trying her best not to erupt with a emotions. Her\n lips were curling into a smile but her eyes were wet with tears \nthreatening to fall. She gently pulled the microphone from his</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything else needs to be said. Thank you,\u201d Ochako \nnodded, bowing to the press as they both exited the small stage.</p><p>Once the audience could no longer see them, Ochako leaped into \nKatuski\u2019s arms. \u201cSometimes I think you\u2019re an absolute idiot, and \nsometimes you are absolutely perfect, Bakugou Katsuki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect all the damn time, what the hell are you talking about!?\u201d he snapped, and pressed their lips together.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised you decided to talk after all!\u201d she whispered, \ncupping his cheeks. She pushed his dark mask up, her thumbs brushing \nover his skin.</p><p>\u201cYeah well\u2026 I wanted her to know we\u2019re proud of her. So if she ever watches this back\u2026 she can be proud of what we <i>both</i> said\u2026\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Ochako couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cPerfect father,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBest fuckin\u2019 mother of all time,\u201d he retorted, nipping her lip.</p><p>\u201cShould we\u2026 go get our babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I think it\u2019s time we went home and put all this behind us.\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>The second Ochako spoke the word 'quirkless\u2019 the news of their \ndaughter spread through the internet like a wildfire. Katsuki expected \nit, they both did, and they both chose to avoid it. The news would \ncirculate for a few days before the next big thing happened, and \nhopefully it would all be forgotten and they could move on with their \nlives.</p><p>Ochako thanked Momo and Shouto for watching the kids, and on the \ndrive home, Shouhei talked enthusiastically about beating Arata and \nYuuta at Mario Kart, while Sayuri whined about being stuffed from eating\n far too many cookies.</p><p>Once they were home, Shouhei argued about doing his homework and Sayuri fought with him about going to bed.</p><p>It felt normal.</p><p>\u201cBut Daddy,\u201d she whined even after being tucked into bed, \u201cI\u2019m not \neven tired! See?\u201d She used her fingers to spread her brown eyes wide. \n\u201cI\u2019m so awake!\u201d</p><p>\u201c'Course you\u2019re awake when you hold your damn eyes open!\u201d he snorted.</p><p>She gasped and covered her mouth, her small finger pointing at him. \u201cDaddy! Swear jar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u2026 I\u2019ll put a coin in!\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cCha-ching!\u201d she giggled.</p><p>\u201cIf I do that\u2026 do you think you can go to bed for me?\u201d he asked, a smirk pulling across his lips.</p><p>She yawned and shrugged. \u201cI'unno\u2026\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cOh really? I think your yawn says otherwise. You had a long day, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d she whined, her eyes fluttering shut. \u201cKiss, Daddy!\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGood night, baby girl,\u201d he said softly. His hand stroked across her \ntiny forehead, smoothing her blonde hair back. \u201cNo matter what happens,\u201d\n he whispered. \u201cI will always protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d she mumbled. \u201cDaddy is the number one hero! Ground Zero!\u201d she cheered sleepily.</p><p>She was perfect. An absolute angel. She could have\u2026 negative quirks\n and he would still love this damn kid with all his fucking heart. He \nloved both of his kids so freaking much, more than he thought he could \nlove anyone. Ochako was up there on the list too.</p><p>\u201cDamn right I am!\u201d he laughed, and kissed her forehead again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the swear jar\u2026\u201d she mumbled, her tiny lips parting as she slowly drifted off to sleep.</p><p>He sat with her for a moment, watching her sleep, her tiny body \nmoving with her breath. He was going to do whatever it took to keep her \nsafe\u2026 to protect her from the awful words people might say\u2026 from the \nterrible things they might do\u2026 And he and Ochako would teach her to be\n the best fucking fighter this world had ever seen. She wouldn\u2019t need a \ndamn quirk to kick ass.</p><p>\u201cI promise\u2026 baby girl\u2026 I promise to always protect you\u2026\u201d he \nwhispered to his sleeping daughter. He wanted her life to always feel \nthis peaceful.</p><p>\u201cKatsuki?\u201d Ochako whispered, peering in through the crack in the door. \u201cIs she asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm\u2026\u201d he grunted, giving her one small kiss before he stood up, heading to the door. \u201cWas just sayin\u2019 goodnight\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ochako smiled gently and cupped his cheek. \u201cI know it was an emotional day for you.\u201d</p><p>Katsuki pursed his lips, looking at his girl. \u201cY'know\u2026 I fought so \ndamn hard, dealt with so much fuckin\u2019 anger all because I wanted to be \nnumber one\u2026 and come to find out it didn\u2019t really matter that much. \nI\u2019m number one to them, and to you, and that\u2019s the most important \ngoddamn thing,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou are!\u201d Ochako giggled, leaning up to peck his cheek. \u201cMy number one man, and number one dad.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his fingers against hers. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it takes\u2026\u201d \nhe said. \u201cI will keep her safe. I will keep her safe and Shou and you\u2026\n though I have a feeling you\u2019re gonna say you plan on helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe <i>do</i> make an amazing team,\u201d she laughed, wrapping her arm around his waist, rocking back and forth on her feet.</p><p>\u201cWe sure as hell do, Cheeks,\u201d he said, kissing her softly. \u201cWe make amazing kids too. We should make more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatsuki, please!\u201d she giggled, and gently pushed his chest. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking love you too..\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSwear jar!\u201d she teased, kissing him once more.</p><p>\u201cI owe it four coins or some bullshit. Five\u2026 I guess now\u2026\u201d he snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou have a real tab going on that thing. Sayu is going to be pleased when she sees all the money in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Katsuki muttered, glancing back into her bedroom. \u201cAnything to keep her happy.\u201d</p><p>And <i>that</i> he meant more than anything.</p>",

Help me!</i>\u201d</small></p><p><small>The sound echoed all around his body; her scream was loud, the sound \nresonating in his chest. His heart throbbed with anxiety, desperate to \nfind his girl.</small></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201c<i>DADDY</i>!\u201d</p><p>With her final scream, he turned around once again, only to see his \ndaughter completely trapped in a pile of sludge. He felt his breath \nleave his lungs as he watched her desperately struggle to escape. His \neyes trailed up the creature\u2019s body, and he met with a familiar face, \none he worked so hard to forget.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d she screamed, her tiny hand reaching for him as she seemed \nto move farther and farther away, the sludge pulling her hand back.</p><p>\u201cSAYURI!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou fucking piece of shit! Stay away from \nher!\u201d Explosions blasted from his hands, propelling him immediately \nforward.</p><p>He would reach her. He would save her.</p><p>\u201cI bet you thought I was long gone\u2026 a small stain on your memory. \nBut when I heard your beautiful little girl was quirkless, well\u2026 I had\n to come see for myself.\u201d A large tentacle of sludge traveled up her \ncheek.</p><p>His explosions sputtered to a stop as he fell to the ground, staring \nat the scene still moving away from him. Why did it keep pulling back \nthe closer Katsuki got?</p><p>\u201cD-Dadd-\u201d The sludge monster was quick to cut her off, covering her \nmouth with his body, his sludge lips opening up to show his \ndevil-looking teeth.</p><p>\u201cShh. Hush. There\u2019s no need to be scared, your daddy is going to save\n you.\u201d He spat the words, his lips moving as if his mouth belonged to \nher. \u201cSave me, Ground Zero!\u201d he teased, laughing</p><p>\u201cFight it, baby girl!\u201d he screamed, pain shooting up his arms, \nmuscles trembling, tendons stripping away under his skin. He couldn\u2019t \nmaintain this for much longer, his explosions were going to die out.</p><p>A muffled scream erupted against the sludge and her round, brown eyes slammed shut as she struggled against the creature.</p><p>\u201cYou remember how this feels, don\u2019t you, Bakugou Katsuki?\u201d the monster laughed. \u201cFeeling <i>useless</i>, unable to move or use your quirk. She has no quirk! No way to fight. Will you save her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I fucking will!\u201d he yelled. His arms trembled as he \ndesperately tried to push himself up. His hands were screaming in pain. \nThere was no way he had enough sweat to get to her, not with how much he\n used and with how fast the sludge monster kept pulling her back away \nfrom him\u2026</p><p>No. Bakugou Katsuki didn\u2019t give up. No matter what.</p><p>His red eyes met her browns, her pupils blown wide as tears streamed down her cheeks. He could almost hear her voice.</p><p>\u2019<i>Daddy, I\u2019m sorry\u2026</i>\u2019</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d he whispered, a burst of sweat igniting against his palms as he flew forward, his arms feeling broken under his uniform.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for his explosions to give out, his hands feeling\n dry as he tumbled to the ground. His body slammed into the concrete, \nhitting its physical limit. \u201cSAYURI!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGround Zero? Number one hero? Can\u2019t even save his own daughter?\u201d The sludge villain cackled, keeping her eyes uncovered.</p><p>\u201cHow pathetic! Where\u2019s Deku? He could save her. Better call for <i>help</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d he yelled. He placed his palms flat on the ground, pushing his head up as he tried to reach for her \u201cSAYURI!\u201d</p><p>The sludge monster spread out his tendrils, wrapping Katsuki in \ndarkness, his body barely able to move as the darkness enveloped him \ncompletely.</p><p>\u201c<i>\u2026suki\u2026</i>\u201d</p><p>There was a voice in the distance and he struggled against the \nsludge. It had to be Sayuri. She was crying out to him, lost in the mass\n of sludge which overtook both of them.</p><p>\u201c<i>Katsuki</i>!\u201d</p><p>No\u2026 not Sayuri.</p><p>\u201c<i>KATSUKI</i>!\u201d</p><p>He let out a gasp as he eyes shot open.</p><p>Staring down at him with concern was his goddamn beautiful wife. Her \neyes were wide, looking over his body, as if to check for an injury.</p><p>\u201cO-Ochako\u2026\u201d he breathed, his chest heaving. Sweat dripped down his \nforehead and arms, his palms covered in it. \u201cA dream\u2026\u201d he growled.</p><p>Ochako immediately frowned, puffing out her round cheeks. \u201cMore like a\n nightmare! You kicked me multiple times and you were flailing all \nabout. You yelled out too, though I couldn\u2019t really understand you,\u201d she\n sighed, rubbing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he grunted, letting his head flop back against the pillow.</p><p>His wife let out a yawn, and slowly sank down underneath the covers \nwith him. \u201cYou\u2019re sweating so much I\u2019m tempted to have you take a \nshower,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 fine!\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. What happened?\u201d Her fingers gently brushed his blond \nbangs away from his forehead. He could feel the soft pads touch his \nsmooth skin, a sensation he was more than used to over the years.</p><p>\u201cSayuri\u2026\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh Katsuki,\u201d she sighed, resting her arm over his shoulder. \u201cIs this about the press conference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 know, Ochako,\u201d he hissed, turning away from his wife.</p><p>\u201cTell me\u2026\u201d she urged, leaning forward to press her lips against the side of his.</p><p>\u201c\u2026the sludge villain\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sludge villain?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026from when I was a kid\u2026\u201d he grunted. \u201cSayuri was captured by him and I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d she said. Her fingers slipped across his chin and slowly\n turned his face to meet hers. Her brown eyes were warm, even though he \nhad just spent all night battling his pillow and kicking her.</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a dream,\u201d she said, pressing their lips together. \u201cYou \nknow if Sayu was ever kidnapped we would go after her immediately, and \nso would Deku, Shouto, Momo, Eijirou\u2026 all our friends\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t fucking save her,\u201d he snapped, pressing\n his hand over his eyes. \u201cAnd everyone is going to know tomorrow\u2026 <i>everyone</i>! Do you know what that fucking means, Ochako?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers pressed against his own, pulling his hand away from his \neyes. \u201cI do. It leaves us vulnerable. But we can\u2019t hide it forever. \nSooner or later someone is going to find out, someone who will out us to\n the press anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hate that it has to turn into this\u2026 this goddamn <i>thing</i> because of who we are\u2026\u201d he scoffed. \u201cAnd who knows who will try and get to us through her\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just\u2026 have to have faith we\u2019re better than whoever that may be and we\u2019ll stop them before they ever even <i>see</i> our baby,\u201d Ochako spoke with such strong determination, and Katsuki sighed.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re stronger than them!\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cExactly. So\u2026 nothing to worry about,\u201d she said, yawning as she rest her head on his chest.</p><p>Katsuki sighed, stroking his fingers through her hair. Even on humid \nnights like this, her hair was so soft and his fingertips brushed \nthrough it with ease. \u201cOchako\u2026\u201d he muttered. \u201cAre you really not \nworried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d she turned her head up to stare at him. Her hair fell over her \ncheek as she let out a soft sigh. \u201cOf course I\u2019m worried\u2026\u201d she said \nquietly. \u201cBut this is your daughter we\u2019re talking about. Sayuri is \nincredibly strong, and I know you aren\u2019t going to let anyone touch a \nhair on her cute blonde head,\u201d she giggled.</p><p>\u201cDamn right\u2026\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI have faith in you and her,\u201d she whispered, nuzzling her cheek against his bare chest.</p><p>Katsuki did have faith in his daughter. He had faith in his wife \ntoo\u2026 he wanted to have faith in himself and the rest of this goddamn \nsociety, but his eyes stayed open, his mind running through the various \ninsults he called Deku over the years.</p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna!\u201d Sayuri whined, stomping her foot against the ground.</p><p>Katsuki knelt down, helping her unzip her jacket. \u201cLook, I get it. I \nwouldn\u2019t want to spend all day at Half &amp; Half\u2019s house either, but \nMommy and Daddy got some real important stuff to do okay?\u201d</p><p>She puffed up her cheeks. \u201cShouhei and the twins are mean to me!\u201d she said, folding her arms.</p><p>\u201cNo we\u2019re not!\u201d Shouhei was quick to retort. \u201cShe just gets pissy when things don\u2019t go her way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi! Language!\u201d Katsuki hissed.</p><p>\u201cSays <i>you</i>,\u201d Shouhei snapped.</p><p>\u201cBoys!\u201d Ochako growled. \u201cEnough! Now, Sayuri\u2026 Shouhei\u2026 be on your best behavior for Momo and Shouto, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Ochako, Shouto and I are more than capable of handling \nthe children,\u201d Momo smiled, gently placing her hand on her friend\u2019s \nshoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not you and Shouto I\u2019m worried about,\u201d she sighed, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cShou-kun!\u201d Arata, one of the Todoroki twins, came zipping around the corner, practically sliding into the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Shou-kun, hi Sayuri-chan,\u201d Yuuta, the other twin, smiled and \nwaved, assuming his normal position directly next to his mother.</p><p>\u201cHey guys!\u201d Shouhei said, cheering up almost immediately upon seeing the the other boys.</p><p>Arata leaned forward, placing his hands on his hips. \u201cGuess who got the new Mario Kart!\u201d</p><p>Shouhei\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup! I\u2019m going to kick your butt!\u201d Arata pointed at Shouhei and immediately began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Shouhei smirked. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 normally, I\u2019m the one who wins\u2026\u201d Yuuta spoke quietly.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Yuu!\u201d Arata snapped.</p><p>\u201cBoys!\u201d Momo was quick to scold them. \u201cPlease play nicely together or I\u2019ll take the game away. Do <i>not</i> tell your brother to \u2018shut up\u2019 Arata!\u201d</p><p>The boy recoiled, his red and black hair covering his dark eyes. \u201cOkay, okay, I won\u2019t. Can we go play now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize,\u201d Momo said.</p><p>Arata sighed and folded his small arms across his chest. \u201cSorry Yuu\u2026\u201d he grumbled, his tiny cheeks flushing bright red.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Arata,\u201d Yuuta smiled and reached his hand towards his brother. \u201cShould we go play now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Arata smirked. \u201cWe gotta beat Shouhei!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>The three boys dashed off down the hall, heading towards the entertainment room.</p><p>\u201cOi! Don\u2019t run\u2026\u201d Katsuki called after them but immediately rolled \nhis eyes. \u201cBrats\u2026\u201d he muttered and turned to Sayuri. \u201cYou can go play \ntoo if you want, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna play with them\u2026 boys are stupid!\u201d she said, and stuck her tongue out at Katsuki.</p><p>\u201cMy girl makes a good argument!\u201d Ochako giggled.</p><p>Momo covered her mouth as she began to laugh and knelt down in front \nof her. \u201cHello Sayu-chan,\u201d she smiled. \u201cHow about me and you make some \ncookies and then we can read a story together while they bake?\u201d</p><p>Sayuri\u2019s eyes immediately lit up at the mention of cookies; she \ncertainly had her mother\u2019s sweet tooth. \u201cOkay!\u201d she cheered, and Momo \nlifted the small girl up to hold her against her hip.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have fun,\u201d Momo smiled. \u201cShouto will be home soon to distract the boys I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Momo-chan,\u201d Ochako smiled, bowing her head. \u201cWe\u2026 hopefully won\u2019t take a long time.</p><p>\"Be good, baby girl,\u201d Katsuki smiled, ruffling her hair.</p><p>\u201cI will, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>Katsuki kissed his girl on the cheek before leaving her in the care \nof the Todoroki\u2019s. Shouto and Momo and Deku and Melissa were their go-to\n babysitters, but since Melissa and Deku were going to be at the press \nconference for support, Momo offered to watch the children</p><p>Katsuki made his way to the car, jingling the keys in his hand. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked, looking at his wife.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>Ochako stood in front of the podium, her hands folding over the edge.\n Cameras already began to flash in their faces, a small crowd of \nreporters and civilians gathered to watch.</p><p>Slipping a finger under his mask, Katsuki rubbed his face. His skin \nfelt hot, like he could pass out from how fucking heavy his goddamn \ncostume was.</p><p>Katsuki knew it was best to leave this part to her. As high as his \nhero ranking was, Katsuki was known for his outrageous bursts of anger \nand his inability to communicate with the press well.</p><p>This was their second time doing this, and it still didn\u2019t feel \ncomfortable. Katsuki supposed it never would. Of course, Shouhei\u2019s \nconference was a little different, since Ochako explained how his quirk \nworked and Katsuki simply yelled into the mic about how strong his son \nwas going to be.</p><p>Damn straight he was going to say the same shit again.</p><p>Ochako took a deep breath, her eyes fluttering shut and Katsuki could\n see every part of her slowly coming together, composing herself. All \nher floating thoughts and emotions pulled tight to her chest and she \nopened her mouth to speak.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d she said, her voice echoing into the microphone. \u201cIt is\u2026 \ngood to see you all here today. As most of you are aware, I am Uravity \nand this is my husband, Ground Zero. We called together this press \nconference to talk about our daughter.</p><p>\"Admittedly, it is a bit strange to me\u2026 the idea of telling the \nworld of such a private matter publicly, but I know\u2026 it is something \nwe cannot avoid. It is our job to keep this city safe\u2026 it is our job \nto rescue those in need and stop villains from ruining the peace we\u2019ve \nall worked so hard to create. What my child has to do with that is\u2026 a \nlittle beyond me.\u201d Ochako laughed and Katsuki could hear the way her \nvoice trembled, tears threatening to pour over the edge. He stepped \ncloser to her, gently placing his hand over hers on the side of the \npodium.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I know the longer we avoid talking about it, the more \nrumors spread, which are arguably, worse than discussing my family \npublicly like this.\u201d</p><p>She took another deep breath, and Katsuki squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cWe have come here to announce our daughter\u2019s quirk,\u201d Ochako said. \u201cMany people have been speculating, since we haven\u2019t done <i>this</i> yet. Yes, I know this may come as a shock to you, but pro-heroes do occasionally read the internet!\u201d she giggled.</p><p>Ochako was so much better at talking to the public than he was. If it\n was him\u2026 he would\u2019ve grabbed the goddamn mic and screamed 'she\u2019s \nquirkless!\u2019 into it loudly for them all to hear and get over it.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, this is probably will make sense given our secrecy at first, but our daughter is quirkless.\u201d</p><p>The crowd let out a gasp, murmurs trickling through the various \ngroups of people. \u201cOI!\u201d Katsuki said, slamming his hand down against the\n podium. \u201cListen to my goddamn wife!\u201d</p><p>He was certain he saw the crowd collectively blink, turning their \nattention back to Ochako. \u201cThank you, Ground Zero,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure all of you are wondering why this is, because at first we \nwere too. It doesn\u2019t make much sense, right?\u201d Ochako continued. \u201cUravity\n and Ground Zero have such strong quirks! Why would their child be \nquirkless?!\u201d She spoke using various voices as if to play the role of \nmultiple reporters.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t know. I guess we both have genes that can \nresult in quirklessness!\u201d Ochako shrugged. \u201cThe important thing is\u2026 we\n <i>love</i> our daughter, with all our hearts. She\u2019s incredibly smart \nand she has lots of energy and she\u2019s healthy. Ground Zero and I do not \ncare if she does not have a quirk. To us, she is the most perfect little\n girl and I know she\u2019s going to grow into a perfect young woman,\u201d Ochako\n smiled.</p><p>Katsuki swallowed the lump forming in his throat, his fingers curling\n around her wrist. He wanted to scream at all of them. None of this \nmattered! Sayuri was the same, quirk or no quirk. She was his precious \nbaby girl, and nothing would ever change that.</p><p>He would work to make the world see that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 well aware of how society views people who are quirkless. One of my best friends is quirkless, and <i>she</i>\n is by far one of the hardest working, most intelligent people I know. \nShe has built so much technology and changed the world of pro-heroes! \nAnd I believe that my daughter can do the same\u2026 if she wants. Whatever\n she chooses to do, Ground Zero and I are going to support her 100%, and\n we only hope society will do the same.\u201d</p><p>For a brief moment, his red eyes met Melissa\u2019s, who stood directly in front. She nodded once, her hand wrapping around Deku\u2019s.</p><p>Clutching her wrist, Katsuki could resist himself no longer. He loved his girl and he needed the world to know\u2026 he needed <i>her</i>\n to know\u2026 what if she watched this broadcast later on in her life? \nKatsuki wanted to be fucking proud of what he said. He yanked the \nmicrophone from the stand. \u201cIf people are rude to her, I\u2019ll come kick \ntheir asses!\u201d he snapped. \u201cHell, I\u2019ll teach her how to kick their asses \nso she can do it her goddamn self. She\u2019s a fucking champion!\u201d he snarled\n into the mic. \u201cAnd\u2026 we love her.\u201d</p><p>Ochako bit her lip, trying her best not to erupt with a emotions. Her\n lips were curling into a smile but her eyes were wet with tears \nthreatening to fall. She gently pulled the microphone from his</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything else needs to be said. Thank you,\u201d Ochako \nnodded, bowing to the press as they both exited the small stage.</p><p>Once the audience could no longer see them, Ochako leaped into \nKatuski\u2019s arms. \u201cSometimes I think you\u2019re an absolute idiot, and \nsometimes you are absolutely perfect, Bakugou Katsuki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect all the damn time, what the hell are you talking about!?\u201d he snapped, and pressed their lips together.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised you decided to talk after all!\u201d she whispered, \ncupping his cheeks. She pushed his dark mask up, her thumbs brushing \nover his skin.</p><p>\u201cYeah well\u2026 I wanted her to know we\u2019re proud of her. So if she ever watches this back\u2026 she can be proud of what we <i>both</i> said\u2026\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Ochako couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cPerfect father,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBest fuckin\u2019 mother of all time,\u201d he retorted, nipping her lip.</p><p>\u201cShould we\u2026 go get our babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I think it\u2019s time we went home and put all this behind us.\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>The second Ochako spoke the word 'quirkless\u2019 the news of their \ndaughter spread through the internet like a wildfire. Katsuki expected \nit, they both did, and they both chose to avoid it. The news would \ncirculate for a few days before the next big thing happened, and \nhopefully it would all be forgotten and they could move on with their \nlives.</p><p>Ochako thanked Momo and Shouto for watching the kids, and on the \ndrive home, Shouhei talked enthusiastically about beating Arata and \nYuuta at Mario Kart, while Sayuri whined about being stuffed from eating\n far too many cookies.</p><p>Once they were home, Shouhei argued about doing his homework and Sayuri fought with him about going to bed.</p><p>It felt normal.</p><p>\u201cBut Daddy,\u201d she whined even after being tucked into bed, \u201cI\u2019m not \neven tired! See?\u201d She used her fingers to spread her brown eyes wide. \n\u201cI\u2019m so awake!\u201d</p><p>\u201c'Course you\u2019re awake when you hold your damn eyes open!\u201d he snorted.</p><p>She gasped and covered her mouth, her small finger pointing at him. \u201cDaddy! Swear jar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u2026 I\u2019ll put a coin in!\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cCha-ching!\u201d she giggled.</p><p>\u201cIf I do that\u2026 do you think you can go to bed for me?\u201d he asked, a smirk pulling across his lips.</p><p>She yawned and shrugged. \u201cI'unno\u2026\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cOh really? I think your yawn says otherwise. You had a long day, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d she whined, her eyes fluttering shut. \u201cKiss, Daddy!\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGood night, baby girl,\u201d he said softly. His hand stroked across her \ntiny forehead, smoothing her blonde hair back. \u201cNo matter what happens,\u201d\n he whispered. \u201cI will always protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d she mumbled. \u201cDaddy is the number one hero! Ground Zero!\u201d she cheered sleepily.</p><p>She was perfect. An absolute angel. She could have\u2026 negative quirks\n and he would still love this damn kid with all his fucking heart. He \nloved both of his kids so freaking much, more than he thought he could \nlove anyone. Ochako was up there on the list too.</p><p>\u201cDamn right I am!\u201d he laughed, and kissed her forehead again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the swear jar\u2026\u201d she mumbled, her tiny lips parting as she slowly drifted off to sleep.</p><p>He sat with her for a moment, watching her sleep, her tiny body \nmoving with her breath. He was going to do whatever it took to keep her \nsafe\u2026 to protect her from the awful words people might say\u2026 from the \nterrible things they might do\u2026 And he and Ochako would teach her to be\n the best fucking fighter this world had ever seen. She wouldn\u2019t need a \ndamn quirk to kick ass.</p><p>\u201cI promise\u2026 baby girl\u2026 I promise to always protect you\u2026\u201d he \nwhispered to his sleeping daughter. He wanted her life to always feel \nthis peaceful.</p><p>\u201cKatsuki?\u201d Ochako whispered, peering in through the crack in the door. \u201cIs she asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm\u2026\u201d he grunted, giving her one small kiss before he stood up, heading to the door. \u201cWas just sayin\u2019 goodnight\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ochako smiled gently and cupped his cheek. \u201cI know it was an emotional day for you.\u201d</p><p>Katsuki pursed his lips, looking at his girl. \u201cY'know\u2026 I fought so \ndamn hard, dealt with so much fuckin\u2019 anger all because I wanted to be \nnumber one\u2026 and come to find out it didn\u2019t really matter that much. \nI\u2019m number one to them, and to you, and that\u2019s the most important \ngoddamn thing,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou are!\u201d Ochako giggled, leaning up to peck his cheek. \u201cMy number one man, and number one dad.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his fingers against hers. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it takes\u2026\u201d \nhe said. \u201cI will keep her safe. I will keep her safe and Shou and you\u2026\n though I have a feeling you\u2019re gonna say you plan on helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe <i>do</i> make an amazing team,\u201d she laughed, wrapping her arm around his waist, rocking back and forth on her feet.</p><p>\u201cWe sure as hell do, Cheeks,\u201d he said, kissing her softly. \u201cWe make amazing kids too. We should make more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatsuki, please!\u201d she giggled, and gently pushed his chest. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking love you too..\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSwear jar!\u201d she teased, kissing him once more.</p><p>\u201cI owe it four coins or some bullshit. Five\u2026 I guess now\u2026\u201d he snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou have a real tab going on that thing. Sayu is going to be pleased when she sees all the money in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Katsuki muttered, glancing back into her bedroom. \u201cAnything to keep her happy.\u201d</p><p>And <i>that</i> he meant more than anything.</p>",

P-Please!</i>&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Where are you, baby girl!?&rdquo; he growled, whipping his head around as he desperately tried to see anything or anyone.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;<i>Daddy! Help me!</i>&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>The sound echoed all around his body; her scream was loud, the sound \nresonating in his chest. His heart throbbed with anxiety, desperate to \nfind his girl.</small></p><p>&ldquo;<i>DADDY</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>With her final scream, he turned around once again, only to see his \ndaughter completely trapped in a pile of sludge. He felt his breath \nleave his lungs as he watched her desperately struggle to escape. His \neyes trailed up the creature&rsquo;s body, and he met with a familiar face, \none he worked so hard to forget.</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; she screamed, her tiny hand reaching for him as she seemed \nto move farther and farther away, the sludge pulling her hand back.</p><p>&ldquo;SAYURI!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;You fucking piece of shit! Stay away from \nher!&rdquo; Explosions blasted from his hands, propelling him immediately \nforward.</p><p>He would reach her. He would save her.</p><p>&ldquo;I bet you thought I was long gone&hellip; a small stain on your memory. \nBut when I heard your beautiful little girl was quirkless, well&hellip; I had\n to come see for myself.&rdquo; A large tentacle of sludge traveled up her \ncheek.</p><p>His explosions sputtered to a stop as he fell to the ground, staring \nat the scene still moving away from him. Why did it keep pulling back \nthe closer Katsuki got?</p><p>&ldquo;D-Dadd-&rdquo; The sludge monster was quick to cut her off, covering her \nmouth with his body, his sludge lips opening up to show his \ndevil-looking teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Shh. Hush. There&rsquo;s no need to be scared, your daddy is going to save\n you.&rdquo; He spat the words, his lips moving as if his mouth belonged to \nher. &ldquo;Save me, Ground Zero!&rdquo; he teased, laughing</p><p>&ldquo;Fight it, baby girl!&rdquo; he screamed, pain shooting up his arms, \nmuscles trembling, tendons stripping away under his skin. He couldn&rsquo;t \nmaintain this for much longer, his explosions were going to die out.</p><p>A muffled scream erupted against the sludge and her round, brown eyes slammed shut as she struggled against the creature.</p><p>&ldquo;You remember how this feels, don&rsquo;t you, Bakugou Katsuki?&rdquo; the monster laughed. &ldquo;Feeling <i>useless</i>, unable to move or use your quirk. She has no quirk! No way to fight. Will you save her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I fucking will!&rdquo; he yelled. His arms trembled as he \ndesperately tried to push himself up. His hands were screaming in pain. \nThere was no way he had enough sweat to get to her, not with how much he\n used and with how fast the sludge monster kept pulling her back away \nfrom him&hellip;</p><p>No. Bakugou Katsuki didn&rsquo;t give up. No matter what.</p><p>His red eyes met her browns, her pupils blown wide as tears streamed down her cheeks. He could almost hear her voice.</p><p>&rsquo;<i>Daddy, I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;</i>&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered, a burst of sweat igniting against his palms as he flew forward, his arms feeling broken under his uniform.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for his explosions to give out, his hands feeling\n dry as he tumbled to the ground. His body slammed into the concrete, \nhitting its physical limit. &ldquo;SAYURI!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ground Zero? Number one hero? Can&rsquo;t even save his own daughter?&rdquo; The sludge villain cackled, keeping her eyes uncovered.</p><p>&ldquo;How pathetic! Where&rsquo;s Deku? He could save her. Better call for <i>help</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; he yelled. He placed his palms flat on the ground, pushing his head up as he tried to reach for her &ldquo;SAYURI!&rdquo;</p><p>The sludge monster spread out his tendrils, wrapping Katsuki in \ndarkness, his body barely able to move as the darkness enveloped him \ncompletely.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>&hellip;suki&hellip;</i>&rdquo;</p><p>There was a voice in the distance and he struggled against the \nsludge. It had to be Sayuri. She was crying out to him, lost in the mass\n of sludge which overtook both of them.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Katsuki</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>No&hellip; not Sayuri.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>KATSUKI</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>He let out a gasp as he eyes shot open.</p><p>Staring down at him with concern was his goddamn beautiful wife. Her \neyes were wide, looking over his body, as if to check for an injury.</p><p>&ldquo;O-Ochako&hellip;&rdquo; he breathed, his chest heaving. Sweat dripped down his \nforehead and arms, his palms covered in it. &ldquo;A dream&hellip;&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>Ochako immediately frowned, puffing out her round cheeks. &ldquo;More like a\n nightmare! You kicked me multiple times and you were flailing all \nabout. You yelled out too, though I couldn&rsquo;t really understand you,&rdquo; she\n sighed, rubbing her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted, letting his head flop back against the pillow.</p><p>His wife let out a yawn, and slowly sank down underneath the covers \nwith him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sweating so much I&rsquo;m tempted to have you take a \nshower,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fuckin&rsquo; fine!&rdquo; he hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not. What happened?&rdquo; Her fingers gently brushed his blond \nbangs away from his forehead. He could feel the soft pads touch his \nsmooth skin, a sensation he was more than used to over the years.</p><p>&ldquo;Sayuri&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Katsuki,&rdquo; she sighed, resting her arm over his shoulder. &ldquo;Is this about the press conference?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fuckin&rsquo; know, Ochako,&rdquo; he hissed, turning away from his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me&hellip;&rdquo; she urged, leaning forward to press her lips against the side of his.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;the sludge villain&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sludge villain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;from when I was a kid&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Sayuri was captured by him and I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki&hellip;&rdquo; she said. Her fingers slipped across his chin and slowly\n turned his face to meet hers. Her brown eyes were warm, even though he \nhad just spent all night battling his pillow and kicking her.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was just a dream,&rdquo; she said, pressing their lips together. &ldquo;You \nknow if Sayu was ever kidnapped we would go after her immediately, and \nso would Deku, Shouto, Momo, Eijirou&hellip; all our friends&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t fucking save her,&rdquo; he snapped, pressing\n his hand over his eyes. &ldquo;And everyone is going to know tomorrow&hellip; <i>everyone</i>! Do you know what that fucking means, Ochako?&rdquo;</p><p>Her fingers pressed against his own, pulling his hand away from his \neyes. &ldquo;I do. It leaves us vulnerable. But we can&rsquo;t hide it forever. \nSooner or later someone is going to find out, someone who will out us to\n the press anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just hate that it has to turn into this&hellip; this goddamn <i>thing</i> because of who we are&hellip;&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;And who knows who will try and get to us through her&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We just&hellip; have to have faith we&rsquo;re better than whoever that may be and we&rsquo;ll stop them before they ever even <i>see</i> our baby,&rdquo; Ochako spoke with such strong determination, and Katsuki sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re stronger than them!&rdquo; he snarled.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. So&hellip; nothing to worry about,&rdquo; she said, yawning as she rest her head on his chest.</p><p>Katsuki sighed, stroking his fingers through her hair. Even on humid \nnights like this, her hair was so soft and his fingertips brushed \nthrough it with ease. &ldquo;Ochako&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Are you really not \nworried?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; she turned her head up to stare at him. Her hair fell over her \ncheek as she let out a soft sigh. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m worried&hellip;&rdquo; she said \nquietly. &ldquo;But this is your daughter we&rsquo;re talking about. Sayuri is \nincredibly strong, and I know you aren&rsquo;t going to let anyone touch a \nhair on her cute blonde head,&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn right&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;I have faith in you and her,&rdquo; she whispered, nuzzling her cheek against his bare chest.</p><p>Katsuki did have faith in his daughter. He had faith in his wife \ntoo&hellip; he wanted to have faith in himself and the rest of this goddamn \nsociety, but his eyes stayed open, his mind running through the various \ninsults he called Deku over the years.</p><p>~~</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; I don&rsquo;t wanna!&rdquo; Sayuri whined, stomping her foot against the ground.</p><p>Katsuki knelt down, helping her unzip her jacket. &ldquo;Look, I get it. I \nwouldn&rsquo;t want to spend all day at Half &amp; Half&rsquo;s house either, but \nMommy and Daddy got some real important stuff to do okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She puffed up her cheeks. &ldquo;Shouhei and the twins are mean to me!&rdquo; she said, folding her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;No we&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; Shouhei was quick to retort. &ldquo;She just gets pissy when things don&rsquo;t go her way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! Language!&rdquo; Katsuki hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;Says <i>you</i>,&rdquo; Shouhei snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; Ochako growled. &ldquo;Enough! Now, Sayuri&hellip; Shouhei&hellip; be on your best behavior for Momo and Shouto, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Ochako, Shouto and I are more than capable of handling \nthe children,&rdquo; Momo smiled, gently placing her hand on her friend&rsquo;s \nshoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not you and Shouto I&rsquo;m worried about,&rdquo; she sighed, shaking her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Shou-kun!&rdquo; Arata, one of the Todoroki twins, came zipping around the corner, practically sliding into the wall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Shou-kun, hi Sayuri-chan,&rdquo; Yuuta, the other twin, smiled and \nwaved, assuming his normal position directly next to his mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys!&rdquo; Shouhei said, cheering up almost immediately upon seeing the the other boys.</p><p>Arata leaned forward, placing his hands on his hips. &ldquo;Guess who got the new Mario Kart!&rdquo;</p><p>Shouhei&rsquo;s eyes immediately lit up. &ldquo;No way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup! I&rsquo;m going to kick your butt!&rdquo; Arata pointed at Shouhei and immediately began to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; Shouhei smirked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you try!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually&hellip; normally, I&rsquo;m the one who wins&hellip;&rdquo; Yuuta spoke quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Yuu!&rdquo; Arata snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; Momo was quick to scold them. &ldquo;Please play nicely together or I&rsquo;ll take the game away. Do <i>not</i> tell your brother to &lsquo;shut up&rsquo; Arata!&rdquo;</p><p>The boy recoiled, his red and black hair covering his dark eyes. &ldquo;Okay, okay, I won&rsquo;t. Can we go play now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apologize,&rdquo; Momo said.</p><p>Arata sighed and folded his small arms across his chest. &ldquo;Sorry Yuu&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled, his tiny cheeks flushing bright red.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Arata,&rdquo; Yuuta smiled and reached his hand towards his brother. &ldquo;Should we go play now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Arata smirked. &ldquo;We gotta beat Shouhei!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>The three boys dashed off down the hall, heading towards the entertainment room.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! Don&rsquo;t run&hellip;&rdquo; Katsuki called after them but immediately rolled \nhis eyes. &ldquo;Brats&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered and turned to Sayuri. &ldquo;You can go play \ntoo if you want, baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna play with them&hellip; boys are stupid!&rdquo; she said, and stuck her tongue out at Katsuki.</p><p>&ldquo;My girl makes a good argument!&rdquo; Ochako giggled.</p><p>Momo covered her mouth as she began to laugh and knelt down in front \nof her. &ldquo;Hello Sayu-chan,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;How about me and you make some \ncookies and then we can read a story together while they bake?&rdquo;</p><p>Sayuri&rsquo;s eyes immediately lit up at the mention of cookies; she \ncertainly had her mother&rsquo;s sweet tooth. &ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; she cheered, and Momo \nlifted the small girl up to hold her against her hip.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have fun,&rdquo; Momo smiled. &ldquo;Shouto will be home soon to distract the boys I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Momo-chan,&rdquo; Ochako smiled, bowing her head. &ldquo;We&hellip; hopefully won&rsquo;t take a long time.</p><p>\"Be good, baby girl,&rdquo; Katsuki smiled, ruffling her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I will, Daddy!&rdquo;</p><p>Katsuki kissed his girl on the cheek before leaving her in the care \nof the Todoroki&rsquo;s. Shouto and Momo and Deku and Melissa were their go-to\n babysitters, but since Melissa and Deku were going to be at the press \nconference for support, Momo offered to watch the children</p><p>Katsuki made his way to the car, jingling the keys in his hand. &ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; he asked, looking at his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I am.&rdquo;</p><p>~~</p><p>Ochako stood in front of the podium, her hands folding over the edge.\n Cameras already began to flash in their faces, a small crowd of \nreporters and civilians gathered to watch.</p><p>Slipping a finger under his mask, Katsuki rubbed his face. His skin \nfelt hot, like he could pass out from how fucking heavy his goddamn \ncostume was.</p><p>Katsuki knew it was best to leave this part to her. As high as his \nhero ranking was, Katsuki was known for his outrageous bursts of anger \nand his inability to communicate with the press well.</p><p>This was their second time doing this, and it still didn&rsquo;t feel \ncomfortable. Katsuki supposed it never would. Of course, Shouhei&rsquo;s \nconference was a little different, since Ochako explained how his quirk \nworked and Katsuki simply yelled into the mic about how strong his son \nwas going to be.</p><p>Damn straight he was going to say the same shit again.</p><p>Ochako took a deep breath, her eyes fluttering shut and Katsuki could\n see every part of her slowly coming together, composing herself. All \nher floating thoughts and emotions pulled tight to her chest and she \nopened her mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she said, her voice echoing into the microphone. &ldquo;It is&hellip; \ngood to see you all here today. As most of you are aware, I am Uravity \nand this is my husband, Ground Zero. We called together this press \nconference to talk about our daughter.</p><p>\"Admittedly, it is a bit strange to me&hellip; the idea of telling the \nworld of such a private matter publicly, but I know&hellip; it is something \nwe cannot avoid. It is our job to keep this city safe&hellip; it is our job \nto rescue those in need and stop villains from ruining the peace we&rsquo;ve \nall worked so hard to create. What my child has to do with that is&hellip; a \nlittle beyond me.&rdquo; Ochako laughed and Katsuki could hear the way her \nvoice trembled, tears threatening to pour over the edge. He stepped \ncloser to her, gently placing his hand over hers on the side of the \npodium.</p><p>&ldquo;However, I know the longer we avoid talking about it, the more \nrumors spread, which are arguably, worse than discussing my family \npublicly like this.&rdquo;</p><p>She took another deep breath, and Katsuki squeezed her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;We have come here to announce our daughter&rsquo;s quirk,&rdquo; Ochako said. &ldquo;Many people have been speculating, since we haven&rsquo;t done <i>this</i> yet. Yes, I know this may come as a shock to you, but pro-heroes do occasionally read the internet!&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>Ochako was so much better at talking to the public than he was. If it\n was him&hellip; he would&rsquo;ve grabbed the goddamn mic and screamed 'she&rsquo;s \nquirkless!&rsquo; into it loudly for them all to hear and get over it.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, this is probably will make sense given our secrecy at first, but our daughter is quirkless.&rdquo;</p><p>The crowd let out a gasp, murmurs trickling through the various \ngroups of people. &ldquo;OI!&rdquo; Katsuki said, slamming his hand down against the\n podium. &ldquo;Listen to my goddamn wife!&rdquo;</p><p>He was certain he saw the crowd collectively blink, turning their \nattention back to Ochako. &ldquo;Thank you, Ground Zero,&rdquo; she smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure all of you are wondering why this is, because at first we \nwere too. It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, right?&rdquo; Ochako continued. &ldquo;Uravity\n and Ground Zero have such strong quirks! Why would their child be \nquirkless?!&rdquo; She spoke using various voices as if to play the role of \nmultiple reporters.</p><p>&ldquo;The truth is, we don&rsquo;t know. I guess we both have genes that can \nresult in quirklessness!&rdquo; Ochako shrugged. &ldquo;The important thing is&hellip; we\n <i>love</i> our daughter, with all our hearts. She&rsquo;s incredibly smart \nand she has lots of energy and she&rsquo;s healthy. Ground Zero and I do not \ncare if she does not have a quirk. To us, she is the most perfect little\n girl and I know she&rsquo;s going to grow into a perfect young woman,&rdquo; Ochako\n smiled.</p><p>Katsuki swallowed the lump forming in his throat, his fingers curling\n around her wrist. He wanted to scream at all of them. None of this \nmattered! Sayuri was the same, quirk or no quirk. She was his precious \nbaby girl, and nothing would ever change that.</p><p>He would work to make the world see that.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; well aware of how society views people who are quirkless. One of my best friends is quirkless, and <i>she</i>\n is by far one of the hardest working, most intelligent people I know. \nShe has built so much technology and changed the world of pro-heroes! \nAnd I believe that my daughter can do the same&hellip; if she wants. Whatever\n she chooses to do, Ground Zero and I are going to support her 100%, and\n we only hope society will do the same.&rdquo;</p><p>For a brief moment, his red eyes met Melissa&rsquo;s, who stood directly in front. She nodded once, her hand wrapping around Deku&rsquo;s.</p><p>Clutching her wrist, Katsuki could resist himself no longer. He loved his girl and he needed the world to know&hellip; he needed <i>her</i>\n to know&hellip; what if she watched this broadcast later on in her life? \nKatsuki wanted to be fucking proud of what he said. He yanked the \nmicrophone from the stand. &ldquo;If people are rude to her, I&rsquo;ll come kick \ntheir asses!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Hell, I&rsquo;ll teach her how to kick their asses \nso she can do it her goddamn self. She&rsquo;s a fucking champion!&rdquo; he snarled\n into the mic. &ldquo;And&hellip; we love her.&rdquo;</p><p>Ochako bit her lip, trying her best not to erupt with a emotions. Her\n lips were curling into a smile but her eyes were wet with tears \nthreatening to fall. She gently pulled the microphone from his</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything else needs to be said. Thank you,&rdquo; Ochako \nnodded, bowing to the press as they both exited the small stage.</p><p>Once the audience could no longer see them, Ochako leaped into \nKatuski&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Sometimes I think you&rsquo;re an absolute idiot, and \nsometimes you are absolutely perfect, Bakugou Katsuki.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfect all the damn time, what the hell are you talking about!?&rdquo; he snapped, and pressed their lips together.</p><p>&ldquo;I was surprised you decided to talk after all!&rdquo; she whispered, \ncupping his cheeks. She pushed his dark mask up, her thumbs brushing \nover his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah well&hellip; I wanted her to know we&rsquo;re proud of her. So if she ever watches this back&hellip; she can be proud of what we <i>both</i> said&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled.</p><p>Ochako couldn&rsquo;t help but giggle. &ldquo;Perfect father,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Best fuckin&rsquo; mother of all time,&rdquo; he retorted, nipping her lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Should we&hellip; go get our babies?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s time we went home and put all this behind us.&rdquo;</p><p>~~</p><p>The second Ochako spoke the word 'quirkless&rsquo; the news of their \ndaughter spread through the internet like a wildfire. Katsuki expected \nit, they both did, and they both chose to avoid it. The news would \ncirculate for a few days before the next big thing happened, and \nhopefully it would all be forgotten and they could move on with their \nlives.</p><p>Ochako thanked Momo and Shouto for watching the kids, and on the \ndrive home, Shouhei talked enthusiastically about beating Arata and \nYuuta at Mario Kart, while Sayuri whined about being stuffed from eating\n far too many cookies.</p><p>Once they were home, Shouhei argued about doing his homework and Sayuri fought with him about going to bed.</p><p>It felt normal.</p><p>&ldquo;But Daddy,&rdquo; she whined even after being tucked into bed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not \neven tired! See?&rdquo; She used her fingers to spread her brown eyes wide. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so awake!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;'Course you&rsquo;re awake when you hold your damn eyes open!&rdquo; he snorted.</p><p>She gasped and covered her mouth, her small finger pointing at him. &ldquo;Daddy! Swear jar!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay&hellip; I&rsquo;ll put a coin in!&rdquo; he scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Cha-ching!&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;If I do that&hellip; do you think you can go to bed for me?&rdquo; he asked, a smirk pulling across his lips.</p><p>She yawned and shrugged. &ldquo;I'unno&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled.</p><p>Katsuki couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle. &ldquo;Oh really? I think your yawn says otherwise. You had a long day, baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess&hellip;&rdquo; she whined, her eyes fluttering shut. &ldquo;Kiss, Daddy!&rdquo; she demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Good night, baby girl,&rdquo; he said softly. His hand stroked across her \ntiny forehead, smoothing her blonde hair back. &ldquo;No matter what happens,&rdquo;\n he whispered. &ldquo;I will always protect you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;Daddy is the number one hero! Ground Zero!&rdquo; she cheered sleepily.</p><p>She was perfect. An absolute angel. She could have&hellip; negative quirks\n and he would still love this damn kid with all his fucking heart. He \nloved both of his kids so freaking much, more than he thought he could \nlove anyone. Ochako was up there on the list too.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn right I am!&rdquo; he laughed, and kissed her forehead again.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the swear jar&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled, her tiny lips parting as she slowly drifted off to sleep.</p><p>He sat with her for a moment, watching her sleep, her tiny body \nmoving with her breath. He was going to do whatever it took to keep her \nsafe&hellip; to protect her from the awful words people might say&hellip; from the \nterrible things they might do&hellip; And he and Ochako would teach her to be\n the best fucking fighter this world had ever seen. She wouldn&rsquo;t need a \ndamn quirk to kick ass.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise&hellip; baby girl&hellip; I promise to always protect you&hellip;&rdquo; he \nwhispered to his sleeping daughter. He wanted her life to always feel \nthis peaceful.</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki?&rdquo; Ochako whispered, peering in through the crack in the door. &ldquo;Is she asleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted, giving her one small kiss before he stood up, heading to the door. &ldquo;Was just sayin&rsquo; goodnight&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Ochako smiled gently and cupped his cheek. &ldquo;I know it was an emotional day for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Katsuki pursed his lips, looking at his girl. &ldquo;Y'know&hellip; I fought so \ndamn hard, dealt with so much fuckin&rsquo; anger all because I wanted to be \nnumber one&hellip; and come to find out it didn&rsquo;t really matter that much. \nI&rsquo;m number one to them, and to you, and that&rsquo;s the most important \ngoddamn thing,&rdquo; he said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;You are!&rdquo; Ochako giggled, leaning up to peck his cheek. &ldquo;My number one man, and number one dad.&rdquo;</p><p>He slipped his fingers against hers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what it takes&hellip;&rdquo; \nhe said. &ldquo;I will keep her safe. I will keep her safe and Shou and you&hellip;\n though I have a feeling you&rsquo;re gonna say you plan on helping me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We <i>do</i> make an amazing team,&rdquo; she laughed, wrapping her arm around his waist, rocking back and forth on her feet.</p><p>&ldquo;We sure as hell do, Cheeks,&rdquo; he said, kissing her softly. &ldquo;We make amazing kids too. We should make more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki, please!&rdquo; she giggled, and gently pushed his chest. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I fucking love you too..&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Swear jar!&rdquo; she teased, kissing him once more.</p><p>&ldquo;I owe it four coins or some bullshit. Five&hellip; I guess now&hellip;&rdquo; he snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a real tab going on that thing. Sayu is going to be pleased when she sees all the money in there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Katsuki muttered, glancing back into her bedroom. &ldquo;Anything to keep her happy.&rdquo;</p><p>And <i>that</i> he meant more than anything.</p>",
