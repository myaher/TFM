Fans were expecting a novel-quality plot to hold them over until the next book, and that&rsquo;s one hundred percent not what this is. Much as I don&rsquo;t like researching a book before I read it, it&rsquo;s better to go into this one with eyes open. <i>A Court of Frost &amp; Starlight</i> is a sweet, fluffy winter novella that shows the Night Court basically hanging out, preparing for a holiday, and managing their respective traumas from the previous series.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people who could watch your favorite characters do laundry and be happy about it, this is for you. If you&rsquo;re plot-driven, skip this one. I don&rsquo;t feel that it&rsquo;s a shameless money-grab (although the price is steep for so few pages&ndash; but then, it looks so lovely on the shelf with the others) so much as a labor of love, and that works better for some people than others.

Worse, she&rsquo;s not sure how she&rsquo;s going to convince an isolated Nesta to join the festivities. Velaris and the rest of Prythian are still in a state of recovery after the war against Hybern, and that delicate peace could overbalance at any time. In between overseeing the Illyrian war camps and rebuilding efforts around the city, Feyre and the Night Court are preparing for the coming holiday and enjoying the fact that they&rsquo;re all still alive to celebrate it together.</p><p><b>Thoughts:</b> I don&rsquo;t usually care much for &ldquo;additional content&rdquo; type-things like novellas/short stories, even though I&rsquo;m compelled to read them anyway, so <i>A Court of Frost &amp; Starlight</i> is a pleasant surprise. It&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s low on plot&ndash;the biggest conflict is whether or not Nesta will show up for Solstice dinner&ndash;but after the abundance of plot, war, and general trauma in the last three books, that&rsquo;s almost a relief. This book is a snapshot image of what life might be like for the Night Court now that they&rsquo;ve managed to survive. They have a chance at a happy life together, and I enjoyed seeing that play out. It reads a bit like fanfiction, in the way that fanfiction often focuses on characters and their interactions rather than What Happens, and I mean that as a compliment</p><p>There isn&rsquo;t a lot of magic or world-building to be had here either. In part, it&rsquo;s because Velaris as the main setting has already been established, and it&rsquo;s also because the characters don&rsquo;t need to defend themselves every few pages. Other than the occasional flying or Rhys and Feyre talking through their mating bond, they&rsquo;re mostly preoccupied with very human problems like what to get each other for Solstice (a task I take very seriously, so I can relate). I half-wish I&rsquo;d waited to read it closer to Christmas, since it has so much winter atmosphere. It will make the perfect fluffy holiday read.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of attention on how the Night Court characters are dealing with the trauma of surviving a war. It&rsquo;s a little hilarious to see Rhysand, the most powerful High Lord in history, acting like a lovesick teenager who can&rsquo;t keep it in his pants. Feyre wonders whether it&rsquo;s right to spend time painting, which helps her healing process, when there are so many other things that need to be done for her city. Tamlin and Nesta isolate themselves from everyone, and Cassian tries to save the Illyrians from thousands of years of ingrained bigotry. There&rsquo;s much less attention given to Azriel, Elain, and Morrigan (my queen). We&rsquo;re never granted chapters from their perspectives, and if there&rsquo;s one thing I would change about this novella, it&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;d have more time/development with them. Alas, there are only so many pages. While I doubt it will be necessary to read it to understand the next book, it does serve as a nice bridge to the coming novels and a bow on top of Feyre and Rhysand&rsquo;s finished story.</p>",

Much as I don\u2019t like researching a book before I read it, it\u2019s better to go into this one with eyes open. <i>A Court of Frost &amp; Starlight</i> is a sweet, fluffy winter novella that shows the Night Court basically hanging out, preparing for a holiday, and managing their respective traumas from the previous series.</p><p>If you\u2019re one of those people who could watch your favorite characters do laundry and be happy about it, this is for you. If you\u2019re plot-driven, skip this one. I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s a shameless money-grab (although the price is steep for so few pages\u2013 but then, it looks so lovely on the shelf with the others) so much as a labor of love, and that works better for some people than others. There are spoilers ahead for <i><a href=\"http://brightbeautifulthings.tumblr.com/post/149750830917/a-court-of-thorns-roses-by-sarah-j-maas-be\" target=\"_blank\">A Court of Thorns &amp; Roses</a></i>, <i><a href=\"http://brightbeautifulthings.tumblr.com/post/149842884037/a-court-of-mist-fury-by-sarah-j-maas\" target=\"_blank\">A Court of Mist &amp; Fury</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"http://brightbeautifulthings.tumblr.com/post/160808124472/a-court-of-wings-ruin-by-sarah-j-maas-only\" target=\"_blank\">A Court of Wings and Ruin</a></i>.</p><p><b>About:</b> Solstice, a winter Christmas-like fae holiday, is approaching, and Feyre has no idea what to get for her family, particularly her difficult-to-shop-for mate. Worse, she\u2019s not sure how she\u2019s going to convince an isolated Nesta to join the festivities. Velaris and the rest of Prythian are still in a state of recovery after the war against Hybern, and that delicate peace could overbalance at any time. In between overseeing the Illyrian war camps and rebuilding efforts around the city, Feyre and the Night Court are preparing for the coming holiday and enjoying the fact that they\u2019re all still alive to celebrate it together.</p><p><b>Thoughts:</b> I don\u2019t usually care much for \u201cadditional content\u201d type-things like novellas/short stories, even though I\u2019m compelled to read them anyway, so <i>A Court of Frost &amp; Starlight</i> is a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s low on plot\u2013the biggest conflict is whether or not Nesta will show up for Solstice dinner\u2013but after the abundance of plot, war, and general trauma in the last three books, that\u2019s almost a relief. This book is a snapshot image of what life might be like for the Night Court now that they\u2019ve managed to survive. They have a chance at a happy life together, and I enjoyed seeing that play out. It reads a bit like fanfiction, in the way that fanfiction often focuses on characters and their interactions rather than What Happens, and I mean that as a compliment</p><p>There isn\u2019t a lot of magic or world-building to be had here either. In part, it\u2019s because Velaris as the main setting has already been established, and it\u2019s also because the characters don\u2019t need to defend themselves every few pages. Other than the occasional flying or Rhys and Feyre talking through their mating bond, they\u2019re mostly preoccupied with very human problems like what to get each other for Solstice (a task I take very seriously, so I can relate). I half-wish I\u2019d waited to read it closer to Christmas, since it has so much winter atmosphere. It will make the perfect fluffy holiday read.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of attention on how the Night Court characters are dealing with the trauma of surviving a war. It\u2019s a little hilarious to see Rhysand, the most powerful High Lord in history, acting like a lovesick teenager who can\u2019t keep it in his pants. Feyre wonders whether it\u2019s right to spend time painting, which helps her healing process, when there are so many other things that need to be done for her city. Tamlin and Nesta isolate themselves from everyone, and Cassian tries to save the Illyrians from thousands of years of ingrained bigotry. There\u2019s much less attention given to Azriel, Elain, and Morrigan (my queen). We\u2019re never granted chapters from their perspectives, and if there\u2019s one thing I would change about this novella, it\u2019s that we\u2019d have more time/development with them. Alas, there are only so many pages. While I doubt it will be necessary to read it to understand the next book, it does serve as a nice bridge to the coming novels and a bow on top of Feyre and Rhysand\u2019s finished story.</p></p>",

You get so attached to all of these characters! While the individual stories are short (true novella length), each character is given so much depth and personality. This collection also really adds to Celaena&rsquo;s character.
