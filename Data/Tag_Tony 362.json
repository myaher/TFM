This time your poor boyfriend Steve, is the unfortunate soul caught up in the trouble. With Thor bringing Loki to live in the tower, there\u2019s been a bit more mischief around. You and Steve have been together for a little over 2 years, him having met you after rescuing you from a Hydra facility. It had taken a long time for you to become used to being treated like a person again after being captive and experimented on for years. You were a mutant having the powers of the elements on your side. You still struggled with your demons and had bad days but no matter what Steve was always by your side. That\u2019s why with the chaos of the day you knew you wouldn\u2019t leave Steve\u2019s side&hellip;.</i></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cLOKI! What did you do?!\u201d you heard an angry Steve shout. </p><p>\u201cNothing Captain, I can assure you. It was all you. I did not tell you to wish for your old self&hellip;\u201d the trickster laughed. </p><p>\u201cHad I\u2019d known you were up to your tricks I never would held this thing and answered your question!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and walked into the living room to find Steve swimming in his clothes. He was your height, tiny and frail looking. \u201cS-Steve? Is that you?\u201d </p><p>His eyes widened and he threw the shiny rock he was holding back to Loki so he could attempt to hold his pants up. \u201cH-hey doll. Uhm, yeah it\u2019s me. I\u2019m really sorry you have to see me like this\u201d he glared at Loki, \u201cchange me back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot. The spell will wear off on its own. Good luck Captain!\u201d He said as he disappeared. </p><p>Steve sighed and stood there awkwardly. \u201cLoki handed me that rock and asked me if I ever wished I had my preserum body back. I said yeah I do wish that sometimes and now I..I look like this. Doll you okay? You haven\u2019t said anything&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s just..you look so different.\u201d You walked over and reached out to touch him but he pulled away. \u201cSteve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop Y/N I don\u2019t need your pity. Just leave me alone okay?\u201d He huffed as he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cSteve stop being stupid. I\u2019m not pitying you. Come here, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, I can see the way you\u2019re looking at me. You always said you\u2019d love me no matter what but you don\u2019t love me like this,\u201d he gestured to himself.</p><p>You stepped closer to him only to have him step back again. \u201cSteve, baby, please listen to me. I want to help you, I love you, please just give me a chance. You\u2019re not even listening to me, let\u2019s order you some clothes that fit and we can have dinner and talk about all this-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI just want to be alone right now. Just go Y/N\u201d he sighed and turned away.</p><p>With tears in your eyes you nodded and headed to the elevator, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you and I\u2019m not gonna stop loving you just because of this. It\u2019s only temporary. Loki said so. I\u2019m staying with Bucky until you decide you still want me. Good bye Steve\u201d you waited until the doors closed before you let yourself cry. When the doors finally opened on Bucky\u2019s floor you walked out and tried to pull yourself together. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cY/N? Hey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bucky asked from the couch looking concerned. You explained everything to him in detail and he straightened up. \u201cWell he\u2019ll come around doll. He\u2019s stubborn you and I both know that but that\u2019s no excuse on his part. You can stay with me till he pulls his head out his ass\u201d he snorted. </p><p>\u201cThank you Buck.\u201d You wiped your eyes and calmed down. \u201cIt just hurts because he knows I fell in love with him for him, not what he looks like. I\u2019d love him no matter what. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s big or small. I just want him to let me help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him time. Why don\u2019t you order him some clothes and us some pizza and we\u2019ll hang out till that punk comes to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm that sounds perfect!\u201d You set about ordering the pizza and let Bucky help you pick out clothes for Steve. After the pizza finally arrived and you were halfway through a movie, the doors opened to Bucky\u2019s floor.</p><p><br/></p><p>Steve shuffled out of the elevator wearing a shirt and pair of sweats that belonged to you. You almost smiled at him but you held it back, waiting for an apology. \u201cHey guys&hellip;can I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have something you need to say to Y/N Steven?\u201d Bucky looked pointedly at Steve. </p><p>He walked over slowly and sat down next to you taking your hands in his, \u201csweetheart I\u2019m so sorry I treated you so badly. It was awful of me to talk to you like that and I know you were just trying to help me. I just&hellip;I don\u2019t feel as confident in this body. Back then? No girl would give me the time of day. No dame wanted a little guy like me. I guess I was scared that you\u2019d wanna break things off with me if I looked like this. I\u2019m so stupid and I\u2019m so sorry. But I understand if you still don\u2019t want to date me, I-\u201c</p><p>You shut him up with kiss, ignoring the gagging sounds Bucky started making. \u201cSteve Rogers you know good and well I love you for who you are and not what you look like. I love you for your heart.\u201d You kissed each of his hands softly. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna leave you, you goof. You\u2019re mine forever. Besides I always wanted to be the big spoon and now I get to\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cVery funny doll\u201d he grinned. \u201cThank you for being the best thing that ever happened to me\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m eating this pizza because it\u2019s getting cold, can you saps please hurry this up?\u201d Bucky interrupted as he opened the pizza box and started eating. You rolled your eyes, </p><p>\u201cSure thing Buck. But next time you and Nat have a moment I\u2019m totally ruining it. Let\u2019s eat Stevie.\u201d You grabbed a slice for you and for Steve and began to eat in comfortable silence&hellip;that is until a certain genius decided to pop by.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey Barnes I finished the blueprints for that upgrade-Holy Shit! Cap got deflated! Spangles is now sprinkles! OMG\u201d he kept on and on until Bucky threw a pillow at him.</p><p>\u201cTony shut up, Steve can still kick your ass. You ever seen a chihuahua get angry?\u201d He snickered as Steve send him a mocking glare.</p><p>\u201cAlright guys that\u2019s enough, Tony come eat then you can oogle over Steve.\u201d You said as you motioned to the pizza box.</p><p>\u201cI gotta start coming out of the lab more often. I could\u2019ve missed this.\u201d Tony said as he plopped down. Yeah there was never a dull moment with the Avengers but you couldn\u2019t be happier with your new family. </p>",

This time your poor boyfriend Steve, is the unfortunate soul caught up in the trouble. With Thor bringing Loki to live in the tower, there\u2019s been a bit more mischief around. You and Steve have been together for a little over 2 years, him having met you after rescuing you from a Hydra facility. It had taken a long time for you to become used to being treated like a person again after being captive and experimented on for years. You were a mutant having the powers of the elements on your side. You still struggled with your demons and had bad days but no matter what Steve was always by your side. That\u2019s why with the chaos of the day you knew you wouldn\u2019t leave Steve\u2019s side\u2026.</i></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLOKI! What did you do?!\u201d you heard an angry Steve shout. </p><p>\u201cNothing Captain, I can assure you. It was all you. I did not tell you to wish for your old self\u2026\u201d the trickster laughed. </p><p>\u201cHad I\u2019d known you were up to your tricks I never would held this thing and answered your question!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and walked into the living room to find Steve swimming in his clothes. He was your height, tiny and frail looking. \u201cS-Steve? Is that you?\u201d </p><p>His eyes widened and he threw the shiny rock he was holding back to Loki so he could attempt to hold his pants up. \u201cH-hey doll. Uhm, yeah it\u2019s me. I\u2019m really sorry you have to see me like this\u201d he glared at Loki, \u201cchange me back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot. The spell will wear off on its own. Good luck Captain!\u201d He said as he disappeared. </p><p>Steve sighed and stood there awkwardly. \u201cLoki handed me that rock and asked me if I ever wished I had my preserum body back. I said yeah I do wish that sometimes and now I..I look like this. Doll you okay? You haven\u2019t said anything\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s just..you look so different.\u201d You walked over and reached out to touch him but he pulled away. \u201cSteve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop Y/N I don\u2019t need your pity. Just leave me alone okay?\u201d He huffed as he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cSteve stop being stupid. I\u2019m not pitying you. Come here, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, I can see the way you\u2019re looking at me. You always said you\u2019d love me no matter what but you don\u2019t love me like this,\u201d he gestured to himself.</p><p>You stepped closer to him only to have him step back again. \u201cSteve, baby, please listen to me. I want to help you, I love you, please just give me a chance. You\u2019re not even listening to me, let\u2019s order you some clothes that fit and we can have dinner and talk about all this-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI just want to be alone right now. Just go Y/N\u201d he sighed and turned away.</p><p>With tears in your eyes you nodded and headed to the elevator, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you and I\u2019m not gonna stop loving you just because of this. It\u2019s only temporary. Loki said so. I\u2019m staying with Bucky until you decide you still want me. Good bye Steve\u201d you waited until the doors closed before you let yourself cry. When the doors finally opened on Bucky\u2019s floor you walked out and tried to pull yourself together. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N? Hey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bucky asked from the couch looking concerned. You explained everything to him in detail and he straightened up. \u201cWell he\u2019ll come around doll. He\u2019s stubborn you and I both know that but that\u2019s no excuse on his part. You can stay with me till he pulls his head out his ass\u201d he snorted. </p><p>\u201cThank you Buck.\u201d You wiped your eyes and calmed down. \u201cIt just hurts because he knows I fell in love with him for him, not what he looks like. I\u2019d love him no matter what. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s big or small. I just want him to let me help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him time. Why don\u2019t you order him some clothes and us some pizza and we\u2019ll hang out till that punk comes to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm that sounds perfect!\u201d You set about ordering the pizza and let Bucky help you pick out clothes for Steve. After the pizza finally arrived and you were halfway through a movie, the doors opened to Bucky\u2019s floor.</p><p><br></p><p>Steve shuffled out of the elevator wearing a shirt and pair of sweats that belonged to you. You almost smiled at him but you held it back, waiting for an apology. \u201cHey guys\u2026can I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have something you need to say to Y/N Steven?\u201d Bucky looked pointedly at Steve. </p><p>He walked over slowly and sat down next to you taking your hands in his, \u201csweetheart I\u2019m so sorry I treated you so badly. It was awful of me to talk to you like that and I know you were just trying to help me. I just\u2026I don\u2019t feel as confident in this body. Back then? No girl would give me the time of day.

The small cages the vets brought them around to before suggesting they visit the Play Room. A single room just barely big enough for a table, two chairs, and a carpet-covered chunk of wood. </p><p>He thinks of Loki\u2019s face when he first sat down and every kitten in the room <i>ran</i> to him. </p><p>Tony sits up and finds Loki staring at him with the same stubborn look on his face. He knew this was going to be hard, but he thought getting a cat would be a good trial run for future adoptions. Something easy, something they could do together without arguing. </p><p>Tony sighs.</p><p>Yeah, he was optimistic for once in his life. Sue him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright, I guess we\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI will let you name <i>one</i> of them,\u201d Loki interrupts, all semblance of \u2018I\u2019ll fight you\u2019 gone in seconds.

I have so many fandoms, I can never remember all of them but some of my favorites are Gravity Falls, Star Wars (especially Rebels), Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Lunar Chronicles, Ranger's Apprentice, Marvel, Star Trek, MLP:FiM, Adventures in Odyssey, Disney, HTTYD, White Collar, Stranger Things, Ratchet and Clank, Uncharted, Parks and Rec, Avatar:TLA and LoK. One of my biggest fandoms is a webcomic called The Silver Eye, it's so great you should totally check it out! Basically I'm just a God-loving, homeschooled fangirl. Offline Tues, and Thursdays.
