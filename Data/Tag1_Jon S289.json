Some nights she dreamt that she was someone else; instead of being unhappy of her existence Y/n was happy. Her father had preyed upon her since she was young, making Y/n and her sisters his bride, no one was allowed to touch them or look upon them. The hope she once held about escaping and leaving everything behind begun to diminish when she learned that she was with child. She did not wish to endanger her unborn child out there in the wilderness on her own; Y/n preyed that her father would not take her child away from her and sacrifices them to the white walkers. \u00a0</p><p>Y/n was seven moons when the Lord Commander and his rangers arrived to meet with her father; she had wandered outside to gather some water from the well. Her sisters had asked her to be careful, worried of the harm it may cause to her child, but her father did not care and ordered her outside anyway. She had been struggling with a heavy bucket of water when a young man came to her aid, at first she was weary she had never had been treated with kindness.</p><p>\u2018Let me help you with that\u2019 he offered as saw her swollen stomach.</p><p>\u2018No I can manage\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It looks heavy; please I just want to help\u2019</p><p>Y/n looked into his eyes attempting to see if he was lying but instead she saw only kindness, no coldness behind them. Jon takes the bucket from her hand as they slowly walk back towards her fathers keep.</p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 she tells him \u2018I am sorry if I was rude, my sisters and I are strangers to such kindnesses</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/n\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is your father always so\u2026forward?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My father is a monster\u2019 she tells him with a scowl \u2018I wish I could get away from here\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did he do that to you?\u2019</p><p>Y/n looks down at her stomach as she cradles herself with her hands.</p><p> \u2018Yes\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am so sorry\u2019</p><p>\u2018You do not need to apologise Jon, you did not do this and you do not know the horrors of what my father is capable of\u2019 They stop a few feet from the entrance of the wooden building, Jon looks back at her concerned that something was wrong \u2018I can take the bucket now, if my father catches you talking to me he will kill you\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am not afraid of him\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, I do not want your death on my conscience\u2019 </p><p>Jon places the handle back into her hands and watches her walk back inside the dark hall; the wind begins to blow harder forcing him to wrap his cloak tighter around his neck. \u00a0He stays outside a little longer as his mind wanders back to Craster\u2019s daughter Y/n; she was beautiful and could not believe that she had to suffer at the hands of her father. He was angered that the Lord Commander had done nothing to stop the man, if that had been his own sister Jon would have Craster killed. No longer able to take the cold wind Jon walks inside and finds Craster trying to grab at Y/n, but she escapes his clutches and rushes away. Jon takes a seat by the Lord Commander as he looks into the flames of the fire, attempting to ignore Craster and his cruel words.</p><p>That night the air had become colder as the fire began to dwindle, Jon shivers as he tries his hardest to stay warm. His back is pressed against the wall as he watches the others sleep on the floor, he was having trouble sleeping as he thought about his family. His mind is pulled away when he hears light footsteps approach him, as he scans the dim hall he can see Y/n walking towards him as she tries her hardest not to wake the others. In her arms she held a large wool blanket as she holds it out to him.</p><p>\u2018I saw that you were cold, I thought you could use a blanket\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your father\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are safe, please take it, it is also to say thank you for helping me\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 he tells her with a small smile.</p><p>\u2018Can I sit with you a while?\u2019</p><p>Jon nods before she slowly sits down by his side, he sees her shiver as she settles down and wraps both her and himself in the blanket. He feels his body gradually warm up thanks to the thickness of the blanket. </p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you worried that someone might see us?\u2019 he asks as he looks at Y/n.</p><p>\u2018Not at this moment, I am so tired. My babe keeps me up at night and cannot sleep; it is nice to find someone to talk to other than my sisters. What made you join the Night watch? \u00a0Don\u2019t you miss your family?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018My father was leaving for King\u2019s Landing, with my sisters Arya and Sansa. I am a bastard, their mother Lady Stark does not like my presence at Winterfell and I would no longer be welcomed\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never knew my mother; she died giving birth to me. Your mother does she live?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know, my father never talked about her, he was ashamed for so long. Sometimes I think he regrets me\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think your father loved you, he kept you at Winterfell for some time, I do not think he regrets your birth Jon. My father, he only see\u2019s us as cattle and does not care that we are his own children. Where is your father?\u2019 she asks curiously as she pulls the blanket tighter against her body. </p><p>\u2018He was killed by the Lannister\u2019s\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why would they do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He told the truth and he died because of it, now my brother Robb marches for war against the Lannister\u2019s. I don\u2019t know if Arya and Sansa are still alive, my brother Bran and Rickon are alone at Winterfell\u2019 he tells her as tears form in his eyes.</p><p>\u2018You should go to them, help them\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t I made a vow\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I wish I could leave, I hate it here if I stay here I will die and so will my child\u2019 </p><p>\u2018How can you know that will happen?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018My father he does something with our children, he has sacrificed my brothers to the cold dark night. He takes them while we are sleeping and takes them into the woods, that is why there is no men here, no boys\u2019 Y/n bows her head as she avoids his gaze.</p><p>\u2018What does he do to them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You wouldn\u2019t believe me, no one does. They think we are all mad\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please Y/n\u2019</p><p>Y/n raises her head and looks into his eyes.</p><p>\u2018White walkers, he gives them to them so that he may live, he does not care for us\u2019</p><p>\u2018White walkers are myth\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tonight follow my father into the woods, my sister gave birth to a child he will take him and he will not be seen again\u2019 telling him firmly, at the same time she feels her child kick within her \u2018Ouch\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My child, they kicked. Do you want to feel it?\u2019</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer her and only nods, Y/n takes his hand and places it onto her stomach, and he waits for a moment as he feels a small nudge against his palm he smiles as he looks down at his hand. Jon was surprised that the child continued to kick, he then looks up to Y/n and sees her smiling brightly. He was drawn into her beauty and her smile, after everything that was happening to her and around her she had a reason to smile. </p><p>\u2018I will help you\u2019</p><p>Y/n looks up and meets his stare.</p><p>\u2018Help me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get away from here, from your father I can keep you and your child safe\u2019</p><p>\u2018Truly? It is not a trick\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everything I have seen with the Night watch, it wasn\u2019t what I expected. My family need me, I have to get back to my brother and help him with the Lannister\u2019s\u2019 he tells her \u2018Gather your things, I will meet you outside and we will leave\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you Jon, thank you\u2019 Y/n leans into him and presses her lips against his cheek; she fails to see the red tint spreading onto his cheeks \u2018I will get my things\u2019</p><p>Y/n quickly stands and sneaks away as quiet as she can, whilst Jon walks outside into the cold night and to the stables. He quickly places the saddle onto the horse and the reins, hoping that he would not be seen and stopped. He is only waiting for a short time when Y/n finally joins him in the stables with a bag across her body.</p><p>\u2018Are you sure we should be doing this? I have heard what they do when men leave the Night\u2019s Watch\u2019 </p><p>\u2018My brother needs me, if you\u2019re right and stay here with your father you may die. If you come with me I promise to keep you safe, I give you my word\u2019 he vows \u2018I will not hurt you\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, I will come but I think you will need to help me up onto your horse\u2019</p><p>Jon chuckles as he takes her hand leading her to his stead, placing his hands onto her waist he lifts her up with a groan and places her onto the saddle. \u00a0Y/n shuffles forward so that Jon can sit behind her, as Jon climbs up Y/n feels his chest against her back. He moves his arms around her and takes the reins; he slowly leads the horse out of the camp hoping that they will not be heard and picks up the pace when he know they are safely away. </p><p>Along the way Y/n and Jon become lost in fog and mist, instead of leading them towards the wall they head further north. Jon becomes worried that he may come across wildlings in the hills, both of them scared that they may be caught by the Night\u2019s Watch or her father. But her father had no army, he could lead a search for her and take her back home but the other rangers could. As time passed it was becoming harder for Y/n to move and travel upon the horse, Jon hoped to find somewhere safe for them to stay so she could give birth to her child. </p><p>They had camped for the night along the mountains, Jon had created a smile fire to keep them warm but it was so cold it wasn\u2019t working. \u00a0Jon had wrapped them in a fur blanket that Y/n had brought with her; he hoped that their bodies close together would keep them warm. Y/n was the first to fall asleep, her head rested on his shoulder as he heard her lightly snore and Jon followed shortly after. Jon had to admire her, not once had she complained through their journey even when they realised they were lost and had no idea where they were going, but one thing he needed to do was get to his brother before it was too late. </p><p>They woke the next morning with figures standing above them and swords pointed at them, they were wildings, Jon quickly reaches for his sword but finds it missing.</p><p>\u2018Looking for this?\u2019 a woman\u2019s voice asks him, he looks up towards the voice and watches as they pull down their hood.</p><p>\u2018Another raven has lost his way, we should take him to Mance, and he will know what to do with him\u2019 another voice interrupts.</p><p>\u2018Maybe we could kill him; he will lead more of the Night\u2019s watch here\u2019</p><p>Y/n shuffles her body into his side, scared of what they might do to them, worried that they may harm her baby. </p><p>\u2018I am no longer with the Night\u2019s Watch\u2019 Jon tells them firmly.</p><p>\u2018Ran off with a woman I see, I don\u2019t understand those men and their stupid vows\u2019 the woman speaks up \u2018Take them with us, Mance will want to talk to this one\u2019 </p><p>Both Y/n and Jon are grabbed from behind and quickly pulled to their feet, the movement causing Y/n pain and clutch her stomach.</p><p>\u2018Ouch!\u2019 Y/n calls out.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019 the woman asks as she walks towards Y/n and pulls open her cloak. She smirks when she sees the woman\u2019s swollen belly \u2018Well someone has been busy\u2019</p><p>Y/n and Jon have their hands tied and are taken on a long trek back the wildlings camp, Y/n remains by his side and do as the Wildlings asked scared of what they may do if she does not. It takes days before they reach the camp, both Jon and Y/n are surprised of the numbers of the free folk that are there and when they see a giant. They are pushed and shoved through the crowds of people that watch their arrival until they are pushed inside a large tent. It is there they are questioned by a man called Mance Raydar who was once a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, many think the leader is made for allowing to live and believing that they may be spies. \u00a0But Mance listens to Jon telling them his reasons for leaving everything behind, Mance even offers the pair a tent believing that Y/n and Jon are together; even carrying Jon\u2019s child.</p><p>During the night as Y/n lies on the ground upon the furs she goes into labour, Jon leaves her alone to find someone to help and finds an old woman who had assisted on many of the births of the free folk. As he walks into the tent he finds Y/n sitting up and her face contorted in pain, he quickly sits by her side as he tries to comfort her. The old woman moves between Y/n\u2019s legs and lifts up her skirts, exposing her legs to the cold air.</p><p>\u2018Please don\u2019t leave me Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere\u2019</p><p>Jon is true to his word and stays by her side; he does not leave the tent, not caring if he should be there or not. It is in the early hours of the following morning that her baby makes its way into the world, Jon holds firmly onto her hand as the old woman tells her to push. Y/n does as she says and begins to push; it is after the fifth push that she feels her baby escape from within her. The woman lifts up the baby to show Y/n, it\u2019s a boy, and Y/n immediately holds her hand out to hold her son. Y/n promises to her to son to protect him and not to allow anyone to harm him. After being cleaned up and her son cleaned, she and Jon are left alone once again. She names her son y/s/n snow, not wanting anyone to know the true identity of his father. </p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 Y/n tells Jon quietly as they lay on clean furs, Y/n and Jon lie on their sides facing one another with y/s/n lying in the middle \u2018For helping me get away from my father and staying by me\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would never leave you, Y/n I have come to love you\u2019</p><p>\u2018You love me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, if you would have me. I won\u2019t force myself upon you; I will look after you and y/s/n. I will take Y/s/n as if he were my own flesh and blood\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you too Jon and yes I will have you\u2019 </p><p>Jon moves closer to Y/n and presses his lips upon hers, for the first time Y/n does not feel herself recoiling and instead feeling happy. As Jon pulls away she smiles at him as he relaxes back into his spot, she feels happier than she had been her entire life. She was safe, she had her son that she loved more than life itself and now a man who returned her love. </p>",

Some nights she dreamt that she was someone else; instead of being unhappy of her existence Y/n was happy. Her father had preyed upon her since she was young, making Y/n and her sisters his bride, no one was allowed to touch them or look upon them. The hope she once held about escaping and leaving everything behind begun to diminish when she learned that she was with child. She did not wish to endanger her unborn child out there in the wilderness on her own; Y/n preyed that her father would not take her child away from her and sacrifices them to the white walkers. \u00a0</p><p>Y/n was seven moons when the Lord Commander and his rangers arrived to meet with her father; she had wandered outside to gather some water from the well. Her sisters had asked her to be careful, worried of the harm it may cause to her child, but her father did not care and ordered her outside anyway. She had been struggling with a heavy bucket of water when a young man came to her aid, at first she was weary she had never had been treated with kindness.</p><p>\u2018Let me help you with that\u2019 he offered as saw her swollen stomach.</p><p>\u2018No I can manage\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It looks heavy; please I just want to help\u2019</p><p>Y/n looked into his eyes attempting to see if he was lying but instead she saw only kindness, no coldness behind them. Jon takes the bucket from her hand as they slowly walk back towards her fathers keep.</p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 she tells him \u2018I am sorry if I was rude, my sisters and I are strangers to such kindnesses</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/n\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is your father always so\u2026forward?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My father is a monster\u2019 she tells him with a scowl \u2018I wish I could get away from here\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did he do that to you?\u2019</p><p>Y/n looks down at her stomach as she cradles herself with her hands.</p><p> \u2018Yes\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am so sorry\u2019</p><p>\u2018You do not need to apologise Jon, you did not do this and you do not know the horrors of what my father is capable of\u2019 They stop a few feet from the entrance of the wooden building, Jon looks back at her concerned that something was wrong \u2018I can take the bucket now, if my father catches you talking to me he will kill you\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am not afraid of him\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, I do not want your death on my conscience\u2019 </p><p>Jon places the handle back into her hands and watches her walk back inside the dark hall; the wind begins to blow harder forcing him to wrap his cloak tighter around his neck. \u00a0He stays outside a little longer as his mind wanders back to Craster\u2019s daughter Y/n; she was beautiful and could not believe that she had to suffer at the hands of her father. He was angered that the Lord Commander had done nothing to stop the man, if that had been his own sister Jon would have Craster killed. No longer able to take the cold wind Jon walks inside and finds Craster trying to grab at Y/n, but she escapes his clutches and rushes away. Jon takes a seat by the Lord Commander as he looks into the flames of the fire, attempting to ignore Craster and his cruel words.</p><p>That night the air had become colder as the fire began to dwindle, Jon shivers as he tries his hardest to stay warm. His back is pressed against the wall as he watches the others sleep on the floor, he was having trouble sleeping as he thought about his family. His mind is pulled away when he hears light footsteps approach him, as he scans the dim hall he can see Y/n walking towards him as she tries her hardest not to wake the others. In her arms she held a large wool blanket as she holds it out to him.</p><p>\u2018I saw that you were cold, I thought you could use a blanket\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your father\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are safe, please take it, it is also to say thank you for helping me\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 he tells her with a small smile.</p><p>\u2018Can I sit with you a while?\u2019</p><p>Jon nods before she slowly sits down by his side, he sees her shiver as she settles down and wraps both her and himself in the blanket.

It is there they are questioned by a man called Mance Raydar who was once a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, many think the leader is made for allowing to live and believing that they may be spies. \u00a0But Mance listens to Jon telling them his reasons for leaving everything behind, Mance even offers the pair a tent believing that Y/n and Jon are together; even carrying Jon\u2019s child.</p><p>During the night as Y/n lies on the ground upon the furs she goes into labour, Jon leaves her alone to find someone to help and finds an old woman who had assisted on many of the births of the free folk. As he walks into the tent he finds Y/n sitting up and her face contorted in pain, he quickly sits by her side as he tries to comfort her. The old woman moves between Y/n\u2019s legs and lifts up her skirts, exposing her legs to the cold air.</p><p>\u2018Please don\u2019t leave me Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere\u2019</p><p>Jon is true to his word and stays by her side; he does not leave the tent, not caring if he should be there or not. It is in the early hours of the following morning that her baby makes its way into the world, Jon holds firmly onto her hand as the old woman tells her to push. Y/n does as she says and begins to push; it is after the fifth push that she feels her baby escape from within her. The woman lifts up the baby to show Y/n, it\u2019s a boy, and Y/n immediately holds her hand out to hold her son. Y/n promises to her to son to protect him and not to allow anyone to harm him. After being cleaned up and her son cleaned, she and Jon are left alone once again. She names her son y/s/n snow, not wanting anyone to know the true identity of his father. </p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 Y/n tells Jon quietly as they lay on clean furs, Y/n and Jon lie on their sides facing one another with y/s/n lying in the middle \u2018For helping me get away from my father and staying by me\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would never leave you, Y/n I have come to love you\u2019</p><p>\u2018You love me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, if you would have me. I won\u2019t force myself upon you; I will look after you and y/s/n. I will take Y/s/n as if he were my own flesh and blood\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you too Jon and yes I will have you\u2019 </p><p>Jon moves closer to Y/n and presses his lips upon hers, for the first time Y/n does not feel herself recoiling and instead feeling happy. As Jon pulls away she smiles at him as he relaxes back into his spot, she feels happier than she had been her entire life. She was safe, she had her son that she loved more than life itself and now a man who returned her love. </p></p>",

Some nights she dreamt that she was someone else; instead of being unhappy of her existence Y/n was happy. Her father had preyed upon her since she was young, making Y/n and her sisters his bride, no one was allowed to touch them or look upon them. The hope she once held about escaping and leaving everything behind begun to diminish when she learned that she was with child. She did not wish to endanger her unborn child out there in the wilderness on her own; Y/n preyed that her father would not take her child away from her and sacrifices them to the white walkers. \u00a0</p><p>Y/n was seven moons when the Lord Commander and his rangers arrived to meet with her father; she had wandered outside to gather some water from the well. Her sisters had asked her to be careful, worried of the harm it may cause to her child, but her father did not care and ordered her outside anyway. She had been struggling with a heavy bucket of water when a young man came to her aid, at first she was weary she had never had been treated with kindness.</p><p>\u2018Let me help you with that\u2019 he offered as saw her swollen stomach.</p><p>\u2018No I can manage\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It looks heavy; please I just want to help\u2019</p><p>Y/n looked into his eyes attempting to see if he was lying but instead she saw only kindness, no coldness behind them. Jon takes the bucket from her hand as they slowly walk back towards her fathers keep.</p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 she tells him \u2018I am sorry if I was rude, my sisters and I are strangers to such kindnesses</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/n\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is your father always so\u2026forward?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My father is a monster\u2019 she tells him with a scowl \u2018I wish I could get away from here\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did he do that to you?\u2019</p><p>Y/n looks down at her stomach as she cradles herself with her hands.</p><p> \u2018Yes\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am so sorry\u2019</p><p>\u2018You do not need to apologise Jon, you did not do this and you do not know the horrors of what my father is capable of\u2019 They stop a few feet from the entrance of the wooden building, Jon looks back at her concerned that something was wrong \u2018I can take the bucket now, if my father catches you talking to me he will kill you\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am not afraid of him\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, I do not want your death on my conscience\u2019 </p><p>Jon places the handle back into her hands and watches her walk back inside the dark hall; the wind begins to blow harder forcing him to wrap his cloak tighter around his neck. \u00a0He stays outside a little longer as his mind wanders back to Craster\u2019s daughter Y/n; she was beautiful and could not believe that she had to suffer at the hands of her father. He was angered that the Lord Commander had done nothing to stop the man, if that had been his own sister Jon would have Craster killed. No longer able to take the cold wind Jon walks inside and finds Craster trying to grab at Y/n, but she escapes his clutches and rushes away. Jon takes a seat by the Lord Commander as he looks into the flames of the fire, attempting to ignore Craster and his cruel words.</p><p>That night the air had become colder as the fire began to dwindle, Jon shivers as he tries his hardest to stay warm. His back is pressed against the wall as he watches the others sleep on the floor, he was having trouble sleeping as he thought about his family. His mind is pulled away when he hears light footsteps approach him, as he scans the dim hall he can see Y/n walking towards him as she tries her hardest not to wake the others. In her arms she held a large wool blanket as she holds it out to him.</p><p>\u2018I saw that you were cold, I thought you could use a blanket\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your father\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are safe, please take it, it is also to say thank you for helping me\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 he tells her with a small smile.</p><p>\u2018Can I sit with you a while?\u2019</p><p>Jon nods before she slowly sits down by his side, he sees her shiver as she settles down and wraps both her and himself in the blanket. He feels his body gradually warm up thanks to the thickness of the blanket. </p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you worried that someone might see us?\u2019 he asks as he looks at Y/n.</p><p>\u2018Not at this moment, I am so tired. My babe keeps me up at night and cannot sleep; it is nice to find someone to talk to other than my sisters. What made you join the Night watch? \u00a0Don\u2019t you miss your family?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018My father was leaving for King\u2019s Landing, with my sisters Arya and Sansa. I am a bastard, their mother Lady Stark does not like my presence at Winterfell and I would no longer be welcomed\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never knew my mother; she died giving birth to me. Your mother does she live?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know, my father never talked about her, he was ashamed for so long. Sometimes I think he regrets me\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think your father loved you, he kept you at Winterfell for some time, I do not think he regrets your birth Jon. My father, he only see\u2019s us as cattle and does not care that we are his own children. Where is your father?\u2019 she asks curiously as she pulls the blanket tighter against her body. </p><p>\u2018He was killed by the Lannister\u2019s\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why would they do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He told the truth and he died because of it, now my brother Robb marches for war against the Lannister\u2019s. I don\u2019t know if Arya and Sansa are still alive, my brother Bran and Rickon are alone at Winterfell\u2019 he tells her as tears form in his eyes.</p><p>\u2018You should go to them, help them\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t I made a vow\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I wish I could leave, I hate it here if I stay here I will die and so will my child\u2019 </p><p>\u2018How can you know that will happen?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018My father he does something with our children, he has sacrificed my brothers to the cold dark night. He takes them while we are sleeping and takes them into the woods, that is why there is no men here, no boys\u2019 Y/n bows her head as she avoids his gaze.</p><p>\u2018What does he do to them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You wouldn\u2019t believe me, no one does. They think we are all mad\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please Y/n\u2019</p><p>Y/n raises her head and looks into his eyes.</p><p>\u2018White walkers, he gives them to them so that he may live, he does not care for us\u2019</p><p>\u2018White walkers are myth\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tonight follow my father into the woods, my sister gave birth to a child he will take him and he will not be seen again\u2019 telling him firmly, at the same time she feels her child kick within her \u2018Ouch\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My child, they kicked. Do you want to feel it?\u2019</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer her and only nods, Y/n takes his hand and places it onto her stomach, and he waits for a moment as he feels a small nudge against his palm he smiles as he looks down at his hand. Jon was surprised that the child continued to kick, he then looks up to Y/n and sees her smiling brightly. He was drawn into her beauty and her smile, after everything that was happening to her and around her she had a reason to smile. </p><p>\u2018I will help you\u2019</p><p>Y/n looks up and meets his stare.</p><p>\u2018Help me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get away from here, from your father I can keep you and your child safe\u2019</p><p>\u2018Truly? It is not a trick\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everything I have seen with the Night watch, it wasn\u2019t what I expected. My family need me, I have to get back to my brother and help him with the Lannister\u2019s\u2019 he tells her \u2018Gather your things, I will meet you outside and we will leave\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you Jon, thank you\u2019 Y/n leans into him and presses her lips against his cheek; she fails to see the red tint spreading onto his cheeks \u2018I will get my things\u2019</p><p>Y/n quickly stands and sneaks away as quiet as she can, whilst Jon walks outside into the cold night and to the stables. He quickly places the saddle onto the horse and the reins, hoping that he would not be seen and stopped. He is only waiting for a short time when Y/n finally joins him in the stables with a bag across her body.</p><p>\u2018Are you sure we should be doing this? I have heard what they do when men leave the Night\u2019s Watch\u2019 </p><p>\u2018My brother needs me, if you\u2019re right and stay here with your father you may die. If you come with me I promise to keep you safe, I give you my word\u2019 he vows \u2018I will not hurt you\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, I will come but I think you will need to help me up onto your horse\u2019</p><p>Jon chuckles as he takes her hand leading her to his stead, placing his hands onto her waist he lifts her up with a groan and places her onto the saddle. \u00a0Y/n shuffles forward so that Jon can sit behind her, as Jon climbs up Y/n feels his chest against her back. He moves his arms around her and takes the reins; he slowly leads the horse out of the camp hoping that they will not be heard and picks up the pace when he know they are safely away. </p><p>Along the way Y/n and Jon become lost in fog and mist, instead of leading them towards the wall they head further north. Jon becomes worried that he may come across wildlings in the hills, both of them scared that they may be caught by the Night\u2019s Watch or her father. But her father had no army, he could lead a search for her and take her back home but the other rangers could. As time passed it was becoming harder for Y/n to move and travel upon the horse, Jon hoped to find somewhere safe for them to stay so she could give birth to her child. </p><p>They had camped for the night along the mountains, Jon had created a smile fire to keep them warm but it was so cold it wasn\u2019t working. \u00a0Jon had wrapped them in a fur blanket that Y/n had brought with her; he hoped that their bodies close together would keep them warm. Y/n was the first to fall asleep, her head rested on his shoulder as he heard her lightly snore and Jon followed shortly after. Jon had to admire her, not once had she complained through their journey even when they realised they were lost and had no idea where they were going, but one thing he needed to do was get to his brother before it was too late. </p><p>They woke the next morning with figures standing above them and swords pointed at them, they were wildings, Jon quickly reaches for his sword but finds it missing.</p><p>\u2018Looking for this?\u2019 a woman\u2019s voice asks him, he looks up towards the voice and watches as they pull down their hood.</p><p>\u2018Another raven has lost his way, we should take him to Mance, and he will know what to do with him\u2019 another voice interrupts.</p><p>\u2018Maybe we could kill him; he will lead more of the Night\u2019s watch here\u2019</p><p>Y/n shuffles her body into his side, scared of what they might do to them, worried that they may harm her baby. </p><p>\u2018I am no longer with the Night\u2019s Watch\u2019 Jon tells them firmly.</p><p>\u2018Ran off with a woman I see, I don\u2019t understand those men and their stupid vows\u2019 the woman speaks up \u2018Take them with us, Mance will want to talk to this one\u2019 </p><p>Both Y/n and Jon are grabbed from behind and quickly pulled to their feet, the movement causing Y/n pain and clutch her stomach.</p><p>\u2018Ouch!\u2019 Y/n calls out.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019 the woman asks as she walks towards Y/n and pulls open her cloak. She smirks when she sees the woman\u2019s swollen belly \u2018Well someone has been busy\u2019</p><p>Y/n and Jon have their hands tied and are taken on a long trek back the wildlings camp, Y/n remains by his side and do as the Wildlings asked scared of what they may do if she does not. It takes days before they reach the camp, both Jon and Y/n are surprised of the numbers of the free folk that are there and when they see a giant. They are pushed and shoved through the crowds of people that watch their arrival until they are pushed inside a large tent. It is there they are questioned by a man called Mance Raydar who was once a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, many think the leader is made for allowing to live and believing that they may be spies. \u00a0But Mance listens to Jon telling them his reasons for leaving everything behind, Mance even offers the pair a tent believing that Y/n and Jon are together; even carrying Jon\u2019s child.</p><p>During the night as Y/n lies on the ground upon the furs she goes into labour, Jon leaves her alone to find someone to help and finds an old woman who had assisted on many of the births of the free folk. As he walks into the tent he finds Y/n sitting up and her face contorted in pain, he quickly sits by her side as he tries to comfort her. The old woman moves between Y/n\u2019s legs and lifts up her skirts, exposing her legs to the cold air.</p><p>\u2018Please don\u2019t leave me Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere\u2019</p><p>Jon is true to his word and stays by her side; he does not leave the tent, not caring if he should be there or not. It is in the early hours of the following morning that her baby makes its way into the world, Jon holds firmly onto her hand as the old woman tells her to push. Y/n does as she says and begins to push; it is after the fifth push that she feels her baby escape from within her. The woman lifts up the baby to show Y/n, it\u2019s a boy, and Y/n immediately holds her hand out to hold her son. Y/n promises to her to son to protect him and not to allow anyone to harm him. After being cleaned up and her son cleaned, she and Jon are left alone once again. She names her son y/s/n snow, not wanting anyone to know the true identity of his father. </p><p>\u2018Thank you\u2019 Y/n tells Jon quietly as they lay on clean furs, Y/n and Jon lie on their sides facing one another with y/s/n lying in the middle \u2018For helping me get away from my father and staying by me\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would never leave you, Y/n I have come to love you\u2019</p><p>\u2018You love me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, if you would have me. I won\u2019t force myself upon you; I will look after you and y/s/n. I will take Y/s/n as if he were my own flesh and blood\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you too Jon and yes I will have you\u2019 </p><p>Jon moves closer to Y/n and presses his lips upon hers, for the first time Y/n does not feel herself recoiling and instead feeling happy. As Jon pulls away she smiles at him as he relaxes back into his spot, she feels happier than she had been her entire life. She was safe, she had her son that she loved more than life itself and now a man who returned her love. </p></p>",

Jon takes a seat by the Lord Commander as he looks into the flames of the fire, attempting to ignore Craster and his cruel words.</p><p>That night the air had become colder as the fire began to dwindle, Jon shivers as he tries his hardest to stay warm. His back is pressed against the wall as he watches the others sleep on the floor, he was having trouble sleeping as he thought about his family. His mind is pulled away when he hears light footsteps approach him, as he scans the dim hall he can see Y/n walking towards him as she tries her hardest not to wake the others. In her arms she held a large wool blanket as she holds it out to him.</p><p>&lsquo;I saw that you were cold, I thought you could use a blanket&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Your father&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You are safe, please take it, it is also to say thank you for helping me&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; he tells her with a small smile.</p><p>&lsquo;Can I sit with you a while?&rsquo;</p><p>Jon nods before she slowly sits down by his side, he sees her shiver as she settles down and wraps both her and himself in the blanket. He feels his body gradually warm up thanks to the thickness of the blanket. </p><p>&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you worried that someone might see us?&rsquo; he asks as he looks at Y/n.</p><p>&lsquo;Not at this moment, I am so tired. My babe keeps me up at night and cannot sleep; it is nice to find someone to talk to other than my sisters. What made you join the Night watch? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you miss your family?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;My father was leaving for King&rsquo;s Landing, with my sisters Arya and Sansa. I am a bastard, their mother Lady Stark does not like my presence at Winterfell and I would no longer be welcomed&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I never knew my mother; she died giving birth to me. Your mother does she live?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my father never talked about her, he was ashamed for so long. Sometimes I think he regrets me&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I think your father loved you, he kept you at Winterfell for some time, I do not think he regrets your birth Jon. My father, he only see&rsquo;s us as cattle and does not care that we are his own children. Where is your father?&rsquo; she asks curiously as she pulls the blanket tighter against her body. </p><p>&lsquo;He was killed by the Lannister&rsquo;s&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Why would they do that?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;He told the truth and he died because of it, now my brother Robb marches for war against the Lannister&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t know if Arya and Sansa are still alive, my brother Bran and Rickon are alone at Winterfell&rsquo; he tells her as tears form in his eyes.</p><p>&lsquo;You should go to them, help them&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t I made a vow&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I wish I could leave, I hate it here if I stay here I will die and so will my child&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;How can you know that will happen?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;My father he does something with our children, he has sacrificed my brothers to the cold dark night. He takes them while we are sleeping and takes them into the woods, that is why there is no men here, no boys&rsquo; Y/n bows her head as she avoids his gaze.</p><p>&lsquo;What does he do to them?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe me, no one does. They think we are all mad&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Please Y/n&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n raises her head and looks into his eyes.</p><p>&lsquo;White walkers, he gives them to them so that he may live, he does not care for us&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;White walkers are myth&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Tonight follow my father into the woods, my sister gave birth to a child he will take him and he will not be seen again&rsquo; telling him firmly, at the same time she feels her child kick within her &lsquo;Ouch&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Are you okay?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;My child, they kicked. Do you want to feel it?&rsquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t answer her and only nods, Y/n takes his hand and places it onto her stomach, and he waits for a moment as he feels a small nudge against his palm he smiles as he looks down at his hand. Jon was surprised that the child continued to kick, he then looks up to Y/n and sees her smiling brightly. He was drawn into her beauty and her smile, after everything that was happening to her and around her she had a reason to smile. </p><p>&lsquo;I will help you&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n looks up and meets his stare.</p><p>&lsquo;Help me?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Get away from here, from your father I can keep you and your child safe&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Truly? It is not a trick&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Everything I have seen with the Night watch, it wasn&rsquo;t what I expected. My family need me, I have to get back to my brother and help him with the Lannister&rsquo;s&rsquo; he tells her &lsquo;Gather your things, I will meet you outside and we will leave&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Thank you Jon, thank you&rsquo; Y/n leans into him and presses her lips against his cheek; she fails to see the red tint spreading onto his cheeks &lsquo;I will get my things&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n quickly stands and sneaks away as quiet as she can, whilst Jon walks outside into the cold night and to the stables. He quickly places the saddle onto the horse and the reins, hoping that he would not be seen and stopped. He is only waiting for a short time when Y/n finally joins him in the stables with a bag across her body.</p><p>&lsquo;Are you sure we should be doing this? I have heard what they do when men leave the Night&rsquo;s Watch&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;My brother needs me, if you&rsquo;re right and stay here with your father you may die. If you come with me I promise to keep you safe, I give you my word&rsquo; he vows &lsquo;I will not hurt you&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Okay, I will come but I think you will need to help me up onto your horse&rsquo;</p><p>Jon chuckles as he takes her hand leading her to his stead, placing his hands onto her waist he lifts her up with a groan and places her onto the saddle. &nbsp;Y/n shuffles forward so that Jon can sit behind her, as Jon climbs up Y/n feels his chest against her back. He moves his arms around her and takes the reins; he slowly leads the horse out of the camp hoping that they will not be heard and picks up the pace when he know they are safely away. </p><p>Along the way Y/n and Jon become lost in fog and mist, instead of leading them towards the wall they head further north. Jon becomes worried that he may come across wildlings in the hills, both of them scared that they may be caught by the Night&rsquo;s Watch or her father. But her father had no army, he could lead a search for her and take her back home but the other rangers could. As time passed it was becoming harder for Y/n to move and travel upon the horse, Jon hoped to find somewhere safe for them to stay so she could give birth to her child. </p><p>They had camped for the night along the mountains, Jon had created a smile fire to keep them warm but it was so cold it wasn&rsquo;t working. &nbsp;Jon had wrapped them in a fur blanket that Y/n had brought with her; he hoped that their bodies close together would keep them warm. Y/n was the first to fall asleep, her head rested on his shoulder as he heard her lightly snore and Jon followed shortly after. Jon had to admire her, not once had she complained through their journey even when they realised they were lost and had no idea where they were going, but one thing he needed to do was get to his brother before it was too late. </p><p>They woke the next morning with figures standing above them and swords pointed at them, they were wildings, Jon quickly reaches for his sword but finds it missing.</p><p>&lsquo;Looking for this?&rsquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice asks him, he looks up towards the voice and watches as they pull down their hood.</p><p>&lsquo;Another raven has lost his way, we should take him to Mance, and he will know what to do with him&rsquo; another voice interrupts.</p><p>&lsquo;Maybe we could kill him; he will lead more of the Night&rsquo;s watch here&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n shuffles her body into his side, scared of what they might do to them, worried that they may harm her baby. </p><p>&lsquo;I am no longer with the Night&rsquo;s Watch&rsquo; Jon tells them firmly.</p><p>&lsquo;Ran off with a woman I see, I don&rsquo;t understand those men and their stupid vows&rsquo; the woman speaks up &lsquo;Take them with us, Mance will want to talk to this one&rsquo; </p><p>Both Y/n and Jon are grabbed from behind and quickly pulled to their feet, the movement causing Y/n pain and clutch her stomach.</p><p>&lsquo;Ouch!&rsquo; Y/n calls out.</p><p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with her?&rsquo; the woman asks as she walks towards Y/n and pulls open her cloak. She smirks when she sees the woman&rsquo;s swollen belly &lsquo;Well someone has been busy&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n and Jon have their hands tied and are taken on a long trek back the wildlings camp, Y/n remains by his side and do as the Wildlings asked scared of what they may do if she does not. It takes days before they reach the camp, both Jon and Y/n are surprised of the numbers of the free folk that are there and when they see a giant. They are pushed and shoved through the crowds of people that watch their arrival until they are pushed inside a large tent. It is there they are questioned by a man called Mance Raydar who was once a man of the Night&rsquo;s Watch, many think the leader is made for allowing to live and believing that they may be spies. &nbsp;But Mance listens to Jon telling them his reasons for leaving everything behind, Mance even offers the pair a tent believing that Y/n and Jon are together; even carrying Jon&rsquo;s child.</p><p>During the night as Y/n lies on the ground upon the furs she goes into labour, Jon leaves her alone to find someone to help and finds an old woman who had assisted on many of the births of the free folk. As he walks into the tent he finds Y/n sitting up and her face contorted in pain, he quickly sits by her side as he tries to comfort her. The old woman moves between Y/n&rsquo;s legs and lifts up her skirts, exposing her legs to the cold air.</p><p>&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t leave me Jon&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere&rsquo;</p><p>Jon is true to his word and stays by her side; he does not leave the tent, not caring if he should be there or not. It is in the early hours of the following morning that her baby makes its way into the world, Jon holds firmly onto her hand as the old woman tells her to push. Y/n does as she says and begins to push; it is after the fifth push that she feels her baby escape from within her. The woman lifts up the baby to show Y/n, it&rsquo;s a boy, and Y/n immediately holds her hand out to hold her son. Y/n promises to her to son to protect him and not to allow anyone to harm him. After being cleaned up and her son cleaned, she and Jon are left alone once again. She names her son y/s/n snow, not wanting anyone to know the true identity of his father. </p><p>&lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; Y/n tells Jon quietly as they lay on clean furs, Y/n and Jon lie on their sides facing one another with y/s/n lying in the middle &lsquo;For helping me get away from my father and staying by me&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I would never leave you, Y/n I have come to love you&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You love me?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Aye, if you would have me. I won&rsquo;t force myself upon you; I will look after you and y/s/n. I will take Y/s/n as if he were my own flesh and blood&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I love you too Jon and yes I will have you&rsquo; </p><p>Jon moves closer to Y/n and presses his lips upon hers, for the first time Y/n does not feel herself recoiling and instead feeling happy. As Jon pulls away she smiles at him as he relaxes back into his spot, she feels happier than she had been her entire life. She was safe, she had her son that she loved more than life itself and now a man who returned her love. </p></p>",

Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8806564/chapters/37255835\">AO3</a>.</p><p>\u00a0<i>\u201cDear Sansa, I hope this letter finds you and\nyour children well. I have written several times already, but with the whole of\nWesteros in the grip of Winter, the ravens might not have reached you. The\nlatest message I received from you was the news about the Riverlands. I was\nglad to hear that Hoster Tully has reached Winterfell. I am convinced that you\nwill be an excellent warden for him. I suspect that you have written since, but\nno raven reached us here in the Vale.</i></p><p><i>My health has not been the best of late,\nalthough I try to keep quiet about it. The medicine I take is highly\nrecommended by my new Maester Rhyswont, so I still have hope that my health\nimproves. My old Maester Colemon has died of a sudden fever and my conditions\nhas worsened since that. With the war in the South decided for Daenerys, my\nknights worry that we will have to face another threat from the South soon. Harold\nHardyng, my beloved and trusted heir, is sceptical about your need for our\nknights. Even though several men have told him about the abominations they met\nnorth of the Wall, he refuses to believe. Therefore, I send him to Winterfell\ntogether with Maester Rhyswont, who is also a sceptic. I want him to judge the\nsituation on his own. If anything happens to me I want my heir to honour our\nalliance. This is the fourth message I\u2019ve sent to you and it might be, that by\nthe time it reaches you, Harold is already close to Winterfell. Robin Arryn, Warden\nof the East.\u201d</i></p><!-- more --><p>Jon read it\nout loud. When he had received the letter his first thought was that Sansa\nwould help him steering through the troubled waters. Jon had the feeling that\nthere was more to this letter than met the eye. Sansa knew her cousin. It was\nonly when he had finished reading out the letter loudly and asked Sansa what it\nall meant that he realised that Sansa shook her head in an almost inperceptible\nway.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d\nbetter discuss this in the council,\u201d Sansa said at the same time as Gilly\nexclaimed loudly: \u201cMaester Rhyswont!\u201d</p><p>Jon was\ndistracted by Gilly\u2019s face which was a grimace of distaste. </p><p>\u201cWhat about\nMaester Rhyswont?\u201d he asked. </p><p>Gilly\ncombed Podrick\u2019s hair with determination which earned her a high-pitched yelp,\nwhen the comb did not run through his hair smoothly. </p><p>\u201cMaester\nRhyswont is a very good maester, but he treats women like they are all\ndumbwits. He was one of the few who would protest against me sitting quietly in\nthe back of the classes to listen.\u201d Gilly grumbled. </p><p>\u201cHe is a\ngood healer though.\u201d, she admitted. \u201cHe left shortly before we made our way\nNorth.\u201d. </p><p>\u201cIf he is a\ngood healer why does Lord Robin send him North though?\u201d, Sansa mused, voicing\none of the oddities of the letter. There was a frown on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\nsent the raven from the Vale, if he was already on his way here?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>\u201cRobin\nmight have someone at hand who is capable to tend the ravens.\u201d Sansa stretched\nout her hand and Jon handed her the letter.</p><p>\u201cThis\nletter is from Robin,\u201d she confirmed, fingering Robin\u2019s signature. </p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou make of it?\u201d Jon wanted to know.</p><p>Sansa\nsighed. \u201cWe really should discuss this in council,\u201d she chided him, but\nrelented when she saw his face. His anxiousness which had nothing to do with\nMaester Rhyswont or Lord Robin\u2019s health must have been visible on his face.</p><p>\u201cIt is odd,\nthat Robin mentions the new medicine. I would say, that he suspects that it is\nnot good for his health at all and he wants the Maester away to test this.\u201d\nSansa looked at the nitcomb absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cI do not\nlike this,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe calls this Harold his \u2018beleoved and trusted\u2019\nheir. Why trust him, if he is sceptic about the White Walkers and the\nconditions of our alliance.\u201d</p><p><i>The alliance. The alliance he wants honoured.</i> Jon felt a cold fear clutch at his\nheart. He knew how alliances were forged and he did not like it. Not at all. <i>Harold comes as a suitor for Sansa\u2019s hand. </i>He\nlooked down at his hand that shook with anger at the thought and tried to get\nhis temper in hand. <i>Sansa will not leave\nWinterfell, she\u2019ll stay here with me.</i> He wished he could feel secure about\nthis. <i>What will she do, if this Harold\nsets conditions for the troops from the Vale. What if Robin dies?</i> Jon had\nnever met Sansa\u2019s cousin and Sansa had told him that the sickly Robin was not\neasy to deal with, but he was fond of his cousin and Jon knew that it was only\ndue to this fondness that Robin had refrained from revenging Littlefinger\u2019s\ndeath. He had been a good ally over three years, and the Vale had bled in the\ncontinuous war against the Walkers like the North had.</p><p>Sansa\nseemed to feel Jon\u2019s eyes on her and tried a reassuring smile. </p><p>\u201cI do think\nhe wants us to assess this Maester Rhyswont and his heir. It is a prudent move.\nLet the sceptic learn something about our war, remove the Maester in case he is\nbehind his worsened health, and remove his heir who might be overly ambitions.\nIf I read this letter right, Robin had to appease a hostile fraction at his\ncourt.\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cIt also\nmeans he trust us to convince that fraction and help him.\u201d She looked at the\ncomb in her hands again and then raised her face to him. Her blue eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cApparently\nhe did learn some things while he was Littlefinger\u2019s ward\u201d, Jon tried to\ndistract some of the tension with a joke.</p><p>The corner\nof Sansa\u2019s mouth only quirked lightly. </p><p>\u201cSo many\nravens lost worries me,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cI\u2019ve written twice while you were at the\nwall. It could be an accident of course.\u201d</p><p>She\nconcentrated on her comb again. <i>She\u2019s\navoiding looking at me.</i> Jon\u2019s heart felt like a lump in his chest. He had\nhoped that he was mistaken about the message of the last sentence.</p><p>There was\nan uncomfortable silence. Jon could feel the blood rushing in his ears. <i>I should not have come, I should have\nwaited. </i></p><p>\u201cWe should\ndecide on what our answer will be, if that Harold wants to marry me.\u201d Sansa\nsaid in an almost whisper. She looked up again and this time she held Jon\u2019s\ngaze.</p><p>His heart\nmade an odd jump.<i> Our answer.</i> He felt\nas if Sansa and he were the only people in the room. He did not see any of the\nothers in the room, just Sansa.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot\noutright deny him,\u201d Jon answered. \u201cNot before he has pledged to fight with us\nagainst the Walkers.\u201d <i>I could always just\nchop off his head. </i>That dark thought came unbidden and Jon shuddered involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\ncan detain him. It might mean that you\u2019ll have to go to the Wall again to show\nhim proof.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt\nblood rush in his face. It filled him with grim satisfaction that there was no\nquestion for Sansa, that she would not want to marry this Harold, but he also\nrealised that he might have given away some of his feelings to others. <i>Again.

He was one of the few who would protest against me sitting quietly in\nthe back of the classes to listen.\u201d Gilly grumbled. </p><p>\u201cHe is a\ngood healer though.\u201d, she admitted. \u201cHe left shortly before we made our way\nNorth.\u201d. </p><p>\u201cIf he is a\ngood healer why does Lord Robin send him North though?\u201d, Sansa mused, voicing\none of the oddities of the letter.

His anxiousness which had nothing to do with\nMaester Rhyswont or Lord Robin\u2019s health must have been visible on his face.</p><p>\u201cIt is odd,\nthat Robin mentions the new medicine. I would say, that he suspects that it is\nnot good for his health at all and he wants the Maester away to test this.\u201d\nSansa looked at the nitcomb absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cI do not\nlike this,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe calls this Harold his \u2018beleoved and trusted\u2019\nheir. Why trust him, if he is sceptic about the White Walkers and the\nconditions of our alliance.\u201d</p><p><i>The alliance. The alliance he wants honoured.</i> Jon felt a cold fear clutch at his\nheart. He knew how alliances were forged and he did not like it. Not at all. <i>Harold comes as a suitor for Sansa\u2019s hand. </i>He\nlooked down at his hand that shook with anger at the thought and tried to get\nhis temper in hand. <i>Sansa will not leave\nWinterfell, she\u2019ll stay here with me.</i> He wished he could feel secure about\nthis. <i>What will she do, if this Harold\nsets conditions for the troops from the Vale. What if Robin dies?</i> Jon had\nnever met Sansa\u2019s cousin and Sansa had told him that the sickly Robin was not\neasy to deal with, but he was fond of his cousin and Jon knew that it was only\ndue to this fondness that Robin had refrained from revenging Littlefinger\u2019s\ndeath. He had been a good ally over three years, and the Vale had bled in the\ncontinuous war against the Walkers like the North had.</p><p>Sansa\nseemed to feel Jon\u2019s eyes on her and tried a reassuring smile. </p><p>\u201cI do think\nhe wants us to assess this Maester Rhyswont and his heir. It is a prudent move.\nLet the sceptic learn something about our war, remove the Maester in case he is\nbehind his worsened health, and remove his heir who might be overly ambitions.\nIf I read this letter right, Robin had to appease a hostile fraction at his\ncourt.\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cIt also\nmeans he trust us to convince that fraction and help him.\u201d She looked at the\ncomb in her hands again and then raised her face to him. Her blue eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cApparently\nhe did learn some things while he was Littlefinger\u2019s ward\u201d, Jon tried to\ndistract some of the tension with a joke.</p><p>The corner\nof Sansa\u2019s mouth only quirked lightly. </p><p>\u201cSo many\nravens lost worries me,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cI\u2019ve written twice while you were at the\nwall. It could be an accident of course.\u201d</p><p>She\nconcentrated on her comb again. <i>She\u2019s\navoiding looking at me.</i> Jon\u2019s heart felt like a lump in his chest. He had\nhoped that he was mistaken about the message of the last sentence.</p><p>There was\nan uncomfortable silence. Jon could feel the blood rushing in his ears. <i>I should not have come, I should have\nwaited. </i></p><p>\u201cWe should\ndecide on what our answer will be, if that Harold wants to marry me.\u201d Sansa\nsaid in an almost whisper. She looked up again and this time she held Jon\u2019s\ngaze.</p><p>His heart\nmade an odd jump.<i> Our answer.</i> He felt\nas if Sansa and he were the only people in the room. He did not see any of the\nothers in the room, just Sansa.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot\noutright deny him,\u201d Jon answered. \u201cNot before he has pledged to fight with us\nagainst the Walkers.\u201d <i>I could always just\nchop off his head. </i>That dark thought came unbidden and Jon shuddered involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\ncan detain him. It might mean that you\u2019ll have to go to the Wall again to show\nhim proof.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt\nblood rush in his face. It filled him with grim satisfaction that there was no\nquestion for Sansa, that she would not want to marry this Harold, but he also\nrealised that he might have given away some of his feelings to others. <i>Again. I must be more careful.</i></p><p>\u201cI would\nlike to avoid that. With the gods staying silent, I feel there is great danger\nhere in Winterfell. \u2018Stay alert\u2019 they said.

Not at all. <i>Harold comes as a suitor for Sansa\u2019s hand. </i>He\nlooked down at his hand that shook with anger at the thought and tried to get\nhis temper in hand. <i>Sansa will not leave\nWinterfell, she\u2019ll stay here with me.</i> He wished he could feel secure about\nthis. <i>What will she do, if this Harold\nsets conditions for the troops from the Vale. What if Robin dies?</i> Jon had\nnever met Sansa\u2019s cousin and Sansa had told him that the sickly Robin was not\neasy to deal with, but he was fond of his cousin and Jon knew that it was only\ndue to this fondness that Robin had refrained from revenging Littlefinger\u2019s\ndeath. He had been a good ally over three years, and the Vale had bled in the\ncontinuous war against the Walkers like the North had.</p><p>Sansa\nseemed to feel Jon\u2019s eyes on her and tried a reassuring smile. </p><p>\u201cI do think\nhe wants us to assess this Maester Rhyswont and his heir. It is a prudent move.\nLet the sceptic learn something about our war, remove the Maester in case he is\nbehind his worsened health, and remove his heir who might be overly ambitions.\nIf I read this letter right, Robin had to appease a hostile fraction at his\ncourt.\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cIt also\nmeans he trust us to convince that fraction and help him.\u201d She looked at the\ncomb in her hands again and then raised her face to him. Her blue eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cApparently\nhe did learn some things while he was Littlefinger\u2019s ward\u201d, Jon tried to\ndistract some of the tension with a joke.</p><p>The corner\nof Sansa\u2019s mouth only quirked lightly. </p><p>\u201cSo many\nravens lost worries me,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cI\u2019ve written twice while you were at the\nwall. It could be an accident of course.\u201d</p><p>She\nconcentrated on her comb again. <i>She\u2019s\navoiding looking at me.</i> Jon\u2019s heart felt like a lump in his chest. He had\nhoped that he was mistaken about the message of the last sentence.</p><p>There was\nan uncomfortable silence. Jon could feel the blood rushing in his ears. <i>I should not have come, I should have\nwaited. </i></p><p>\u201cWe should\ndecide on what our answer will be, if that Harold wants to marry me.\u201d Sansa\nsaid in an almost whisper. She looked up again and this time she held Jon\u2019s\ngaze.</p><p>His heart\nmade an odd jump.<i> Our answer.</i> He felt\nas if Sansa and he were the only people in the room. He did not see any of the\nothers in the room, just Sansa.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot\noutright deny him,\u201d Jon answered. \u201cNot before he has pledged to fight with us\nagainst the Walkers.\u201d <i>I could always just\nchop off his head. </i>That dark thought came unbidden and Jon shuddered involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\ncan detain him. It might mean that you\u2019ll have to go to the Wall again to show\nhim proof.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt\nblood rush in his face. It filled him with grim satisfaction that there was no\nquestion for Sansa, that she would not want to marry this Harold, but he also\nrealised that he might have given away some of his feelings to others. <i>Again. I must be more careful.</i></p><p>\u201cI would\nlike to avoid that. With the gods staying silent, I feel there is great danger\nhere in Winterfell. \u2018Stay alert\u2019 they said. No order about going North.\u201d <i>\u2018Stay alert. Stay steadfast\u2019.</i> Jon did\nnot want to leave again.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\nis worrying. I really wish they had been clearer about that.\u201d Sansa agreed.</p><p>Suddenly\nshe laughed. </p><p>\u201cThe best\nway to detain him would probably be to avoid that he even asks the question,\u201d\nshe finally said, when she had contained her mirth.</p><p>\u201cYou just\nhave to pretend that you don\u2019t understand his question at all. Keep yourself\nbusy, keep bannermen around you. And I\u2019ll be very carefuly that he doesn\u2019t\ncatch me alone either.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes\nglinted with amusement. </p><p>\u201cMaybe it\nwas a good idea, that you brought this here. I\u2019m sure we can spread the word,\nthat people have to keep us busy.\u201d </p><p>Jon smiled.\nThe scheme did appeal to him, but it would mean less time alone with Sansa. Not\nthat they had had much of this lately. <i>I\nguess, if I want some time alone, I have to catch nits again.</i></p><p>\u201cI still\nwould like to have an edge. I don\u2019t trust this Harold already. If you read\nRobin\u2019s letter right, he might be very dangerous in his ambition.\u201d</p><p>Jon let his\neyes wander around the room, fully taking in the persons in the room for the\nfirst time.</p><p>His gaze\nwent back to Lady Alys. He narrowed his eyes. <i>The Gods told me that she is like my sister. I should trust her.</i></p><p>\u201cLady Alys,\nthere is a great opportunity to prove your loyalty\u201d he addressed her. </p><p>Alys looked\nup, her face curious in a way that did remind him of his sister Arya and\nshortly made his heart ache.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nhow to fight, but you have not yet a reputation like Lady Brienne has.\u201d Alys\nmade a face as if she had an idea what Jon was about to ask.</p><p>\u201cHave you\nwritten to Robin about Alys?\u201d Jon asked Sansa. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou could\nbe the new court lady of Lady Sansa, dagger hidden in your dress, just in case.\nIt would comfort me to know that somebody is around Lady Sansa, in case this\nHarold forgets himself.\u201d</p><p>Alys\u2019 face\nfell. \u201cA dress?\u201d, she exclaimed, misery plain on her face.</p><p>Jon\ngrinned. \u201cA dress. You would only need to do this for as long as this Harold\nHardyng is here.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help himself. His voice already betrayed his\ndislike for a man he had never met. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d\nSansa interrupted him. \u201cYou cannot possibly order Lady Alys to do that. It\u2019s\nclear she doesn\u2019t like dresses.\u201d</p><p>Alys turned\nher face to Sansa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do\nit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll wear bloody dresses and prevent that man to get you alone.\u201d</p><p>That took\nSansa by surprise, Jon could see that.</p><p>\u201cOnly under\none condition, though,\u201d Alys added.</p><p>\u201cWhich would\nbe?\u201d, Sansa asked.</p><p>Alys gave\nher a mischievous grin that made her look like a younger girl. </p><p>\u201cIf these\nmen from the Vale bring nits and lice to Winterfell again I want you to allow\nme to dump them from the castle battlements and drive them out of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do\nthe dumping with you.\u201d</p>",

The vale might look like a diversion, but it is necessary for a latter plot point&hellip;. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8806564/chapters/37255835\">AO3</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Dear Sansa, I hope this letter finds you and\nyour children well. I have written several times already, but with the whole of\nWesteros in the grip of Winter, the ravens might not have reached you. The\nlatest message I received from you was the news about the Riverlands. I was\nglad to hear that Hoster Tully has reached Winterfell. I am convinced that you\nwill be an excellent warden for him. I suspect that you have written since, but\nno raven reached us here in the Vale.</i></p><p><i>My health has not been the best of late,\nalthough I try to keep quiet about it. The medicine I take is highly\nrecommended by my new Maester Rhyswont, so I still have hope that my health\nimproves. My old Maester Colemon has died of a sudden fever and my conditions\nhas worsened since that. With the war in the South decided for Daenerys, my\nknights worry that we will have to face another threat from the South soon. Harold\nHardyng, my beloved and trusted heir, is sceptical about your need for our\nknights. Even though several men have told him about the abominations they met\nnorth of the Wall, he refuses to believe. Therefore, I send him to Winterfell\ntogether with Maester Rhyswont, who is also a sceptic. I want him to judge the\nsituation on his own. If anything happens to me I want my heir to honour our\nalliance. This is the fourth message I&rsquo;ve sent to you and it might be, that by\nthe time it reaches you, Harold is already close to Winterfell. Robin Arryn, Warden\nof the East.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jon read it\nout loud. When he had received the letter his first thought was that Sansa\nwould help him steering through the troubled waters. Jon had the feeling that\nthere was more to this letter than met the eye. Sansa knew her cousin. It was\nonly when he had finished reading out the letter loudly and asked Sansa what it\nall meant that he realised that Sansa shook her head in an almost inperceptible\nway.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d\nbetter discuss this in the council,&rdquo; Sansa said at the same time as Gilly\nexclaimed loudly: &ldquo;Maester Rhyswont!&rdquo;</p><p>Jon was\ndistracted by Gilly&rsquo;s face which was a grimace of distaste. </p><p>&ldquo;What about\nMaester Rhyswont?&rdquo; he asked. </p><p>Gilly\ncombed Podrick&rsquo;s hair with determination which earned her a high-pitched yelp,\nwhen the comb did not run through his hair smoothly. </p><p>&ldquo;Maester\nRhyswont is a very good maester, but he treats women like they are all\ndumbwits. He was one of the few who would protest against me sitting quietly in\nthe back of the classes to listen.&rdquo; Gilly grumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;He is a\ngood healer though.&rdquo;, she admitted. &ldquo;He left shortly before we made our way\nNorth.&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;If he is a\ngood healer why does Lord Robin send him North though?&rdquo;, Sansa mused, voicing\none of the oddities of the letter. There was a frown on her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;And who\nsent the raven from the Vale, if he was already on his way here?&rdquo; Jon asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Robin\nmight have someone at hand who is capable to tend the ravens.&rdquo; Sansa stretched\nout her hand and Jon handed her the letter.</p><p>&ldquo;This\nletter is from Robin,&rdquo; she confirmed, fingering Robin&rsquo;s signature. </p><p>&ldquo;What do\nyou make of it?&rdquo; Jon wanted to know.</p><p>Sansa\nsighed. &ldquo;We really should discuss this in council,&rdquo; she chided him, but\nrelented when she saw his face. His anxiousness which had nothing to do with\nMaester Rhyswont or Lord Robin&rsquo;s health must have been visible on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;It is odd,\nthat Robin mentions the new medicine. I would say, that he suspects that it is\nnot good for his health at all and he wants the Maester away to test this.&rdquo;\nSansa looked at the nitcomb absentmindedly.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not\nlike this,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;He calls this Harold his &lsquo;beleoved and trusted&rsquo;\nheir. Why trust him, if he is sceptic about the White Walkers and the\nconditions of our alliance.&rdquo;</p><p><i>The alliance.

Jon looked around to see if Robb had magically appeared as well considering Theon never came to Jon\u2019s apartment alone. Jon wasn\u2019t even aware Theon had a key.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cUh why-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, he can\u2019t just assume things! That\u2019s not how the world works. What\u2019s that stupid saying Bran always says? \u00a0\u2018Assumptions make an ass out of you and me?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s right. I feel like an ass and Robb is an even bigger ass.\u201d</p><p>Jon snapped his mouth shut and rewound the last few seconds in his head to see if he had missed something as to why Theon was pouting on his couch.</p><p>\u201cDid you and Robb get in a fight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He set down the book he was reading and awkwardly tried to put on a face of sympathy. In the instances of Robb and Theon\u2019s fights, Robb was usually the one to lay on Jon\u2019s couch and vent. It was rare for Theon to ever come to Jon, especially for emotional venting. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Theon muttered. \u201cMaybe dumbassary runs through your family.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised an eyebrow, any form of sympathy melting away with irritation. \u201cMaybe you should leave.\u201d Jon stood up, ready to throw Theon out the door.</p><p>\u201cFuck, no, wait.\u201d Theon screwed his face together in pain as he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Now Jon was completely confused. It was already unusual for Theon and him to be alone and talking\u2026it was unheard of for Theon to apologize. The only person Theon even showed common human decency to was Robb.</p><p>\u201cIt was a big fight then, yeah?\u201d Jon reclaimed his seat in the armchair.</p><p>Theon didn\u2019t answer the question, just stewing in his anger and glaring up at the ceiling. Jon wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to tackle the subject and just sat in silence, waiting for Theon to speak.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks we are dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Theon sat up rapidly and shot Jon a look of betrayal. \u201cNot you too?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we all thought you were dating,\u201d Jon admitted. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Theon yelled, grabbing the pillow off Jon\u2019s couch and holding it to his face to scream.</p><p>\u201cIs this a homophobic thing?\u201d Jon asked gently. \u201cBecause if it is-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb and I have fucked. That\u2019s not the problem.\u201d</p><p>Jon grimaced. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d Theon didn\u2019t look the least bit sorry, but rather a bit smug. At least he wasn\u2019t screaming though that look was equally annoying. \u201cSo, you\u2019re not dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Theon hissed, throwing the pillow aside. \u201cI was going to ask him yesterday. Make that shit official.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jon wasn\u2019t sure he was seeing a problem here. \u201cAnd-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made reservations that the sushi place! The expensive one by the riverside. And I was going to make the whole thing romantic and classy. I put a lot of thought into this shit and he had the audacity to say he thought we were already dating. Without my consent.\u201d Theon laid back on the couch once again, mimicking a dramatic renaissance painting with his hand thrown over his eyes and his chicken legs draped over the couch arm</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m missing something. Did you not want to date Robb?\u201d Jon asked, rubbing his temples. He could feel himself getting a headache.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah, I wanted to date him. Since high school.\u201d Jon felt like that was a revelation that shouldn\u2019t just be glossed over but Theon continued on anyway, \u201cBut he just assumed we were. Just because we live together and make out and go on vacations together and sleep in the same bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Robb is completely in the wrong there,\u201d Jon said, each word evenly coated in sarcasm as he rolled his eyes. \u201cHow wrong of him to assume?\u201d</p><p>Theon narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t just assume you are dating someone because you do that shit with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are upset you weren\u2019t notified sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dickhead, I\u2019m pissed because I wasn\u2019t ever asked. He took the decision right out from under me.\u201d</p><p>Jon quirked up his eyebrow. \u201cHe never forced you to kiss him and live with him.\u201d</p><p>Theon deflated a bit, only a bit. \u201cWell, no, he never forced anything. But like, dating is serious shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dated half of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Snow, Jon, idiot boy, that wasn\u2019t dating.\u201d Theon dragged his hand down his face in exhausted. \u201cThat was messing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all this time you thought you were messing around with Robb?\u201d Now Jon was beginning to feel a bit angry. \u201cPlease tell me you weren\u2019t seeing other people too.\u201d</p><p>Theon flinched at the accusation. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not that. But I would have been like, nicer or some shit. If I knew we were dating, I would have done more boyfriend shit. Maybe let Robb meet my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Robb already met your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant as my boyfriend, not my best friend since grade school.\u201d Theon paused as a realization hit him. \u201cOh fuck, does your whole family know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known since high school and you two weren\u2019t even dating them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! We still aren\u2019t dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke up then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were never together! Just because he says we were dating, doesn\u2019t mean I say it. That\u2019s not how that shit works. I mean, are we just declaring shit? Just saying words. Like I can say I\u2019ve been dating your mom for six years because I basically lived in your guys\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheon, the fuck-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry; I thought we were just saying shit.\u201d He fell back against Jon\u2019s couch, hugging the pillow to his chest. \u201cYou know what the worst part is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh gods, there is a worst part to all this nonsense?\u201d</p><p>Theon glared at him, but continued on, \u201cRobb doesn\u2019t even think it is a big deal. Not until I got upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to take his side on that one,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cWhy you always have to take his side? Just because you guys are related?\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at Theon. \u201cReally? Not because you are a dick <i>all the time</i>?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cWhatever. Maybe it isn\u2019t a big deal to you guys, but it is to me.\u201d</p><p>Before Jon could even untangle that line of thinking, a soft knock came from his door. Jon stood to get it but Theon grabbed Jon\u2019s arm, yanking him back.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s Robb,\u201d Theon hissed quietly. \u201cPretend you aren\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can probably see my car in the parking lot, idiot.\u201d Jon wrestled his arm from Theon\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to see him,\u201d Theon hissed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not my problem then, is it?\u201d Jon snapped back. \u201cYou should\u2019ve gone somewhere else to be a dramatic idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBro, I thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t even bother tackling that one and instead opened the door to see Robb there, hands deep in his pockets and his eyes downturned. Jon didn\u2019t even speak; he just opened the door wider to Robb to step through.</p><p>Jon watched as Robb and Theon\u2019s eyes met. Sadness and anger clashing in uncomfortable silence. Robb had yet to say a word, just staring at Theon hopelessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make coffee,\u201d Jon muttered, trying to leave to room.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Theon said, standing up. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d He threw Jon a hateful look. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are picking him over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have ever guessed that?\u201d Jon muttered.</p><p>It went unanswered as Theon tried to walk past Robb but was stopped. The two stared at each other, communicating telepathically or some shit. Jon didn\u2019t know. He used to always get frustrated that the two of them could be having a completely silent conversation while Jon sat there lost.</p><p>Jon tried to understand what was being said, or really what wasn\u2019t as the two stared. Robb\u2019s hand was tight on Theon\u2019s wrist, tugging or maybe pleading. They stared unblinkingly at each other. Jon thought, for a moment, he could see Theon\u2019s face soften and Robb\u2019s eyes brighten.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Theon muttered gently to Robb before turning to Jon. \u201cDickhead, we\u2019re using your room to talk.\u201d</p><p>Jon just stood and watched as Theon and Robb disappeared down the hall, the door to his room shutting softly behind them. \u00a0Jon felt like the past twenty minutes had been six hours. He was exhausted, confused and quite frankly just done with this nonsense.</p><p>Minutes ticked by in silence. Jon could just barely hear the faint murmur of them speaking as he went about making coffee, something to set his head back on straight and dull his headache. Once that was finished, he sat back in his chair and tried to read his book again, but ever couple of sentences his eyes would drift up towards the wall clock and down the hall.</p><p>Nearly half an hour and three cups of coffee later, the door to his room creaked open.

What\u2019s that stupid saying Bran always says? \u00a0\u2018Assumptions make an ass out of you and me?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s right. I feel like an ass and Robb is an even bigger ass.\u201d</p><p>Jon snapped his mouth shut and rewound the last few seconds in his head to see if he had missed something as to why Theon was pouting on his couch.</p><p>\u201cDid you and Robb get in a fight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He set down the book he was reading and awkwardly tried to put on a face of sympathy. In the instances of Robb and Theon\u2019s fights, Robb was usually the one to lay on Jon\u2019s couch and vent. It was rare for Theon to ever come to Jon, especially for emotional venting. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Theon muttered. \u201cMaybe dumbassary runs through your family.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised an eyebrow, any form of sympathy melting away with irritation. \u201cMaybe you should leave.\u201d Jon stood up, ready to throw Theon out the door.</p><p>\u201cFuck, no, wait.\u201d Theon screwed his face together in pain as he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Now Jon was completely confused. It was already unusual for Theon and him to be alone and talking\u2026it was unheard of for Theon to apologize. The only person Theon even showed common human decency to was Robb.</p><p>\u201cIt was a big fight then, yeah?\u201d Jon reclaimed his seat in the armchair.</p><p>Theon didn\u2019t answer the question, just stewing in his anger and glaring up at the ceiling. Jon wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to tackle the subject and just sat in silence, waiting for Theon to speak.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks we are dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Theon sat up rapidly and shot Jon a look of betrayal. \u201cNot you too?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we all thought you were dating,\u201d Jon admitted. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Theon yelled, grabbing the pillow off Jon\u2019s couch and holding it to his face to scream.</p><p>\u201cIs this a homophobic thing?\u201d Jon asked gently. \u201cBecause if it is-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb and I have fucked. That\u2019s not the problem.\u201d</p><p>Jon grimaced. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d Theon didn\u2019t look the least bit sorry, but rather a bit smug. At least he wasn\u2019t screaming though that look was equally annoying. \u201cSo, you\u2019re not dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Theon hissed, throwing the pillow aside. \u201cI was going to ask him yesterday. Make that shit official.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jon wasn\u2019t sure he was seeing a problem here. \u201cAnd-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made reservations that the sushi place! The expensive one by the riverside. And I was going to make the whole thing romantic and classy. I put a lot of thought into this shit and he had the audacity to say he thought we were already dating. Without my consent.\u201d Theon laid back on the couch once again, mimicking a dramatic renaissance painting with his hand thrown over his eyes and his chicken legs draped over the couch arm</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m missing something. Did you not want to date Robb?\u201d Jon asked, rubbing his temples. He could feel himself getting a headache.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah, I wanted to date him. Since high school.\u201d Jon felt like that was a revelation that shouldn\u2019t just be glossed over but Theon continued on anyway, \u201cBut he just assumed we were. Just because we live together and make out and go on vacations together and sleep in the same bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Robb is completely in the wrong there,\u201d Jon said, each word evenly coated in sarcasm as he rolled his eyes. \u201cHow wrong of him to assume?\u201d</p><p>Theon narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t just assume you are dating someone because you do that shit with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are upset you weren\u2019t notified sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dickhead, I\u2019m pissed because I wasn\u2019t ever asked. He took the decision right out from under me.\u201d</p><p>Jon quirked up his eyebrow. \u201cHe never forced you to kiss him and live with him.\u201d</p><p>Theon deflated a bit, only a bit. \u201cWell, no, he never forced anything. But like, dating is serious shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dated half of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Snow, Jon, idiot boy, that wasn\u2019t dating.\u201d Theon dragged his hand down his face in exhausted. \u201cThat was messing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all this time you thought you were messing around with Robb?\u201d Now Jon was beginning to feel a bit angry. \u201cPlease tell me you weren\u2019t seeing other people too.\u201d</p><p>Theon flinched at the accusation. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not that. But I would have been like, nicer or some shit. If I knew we were dating, I would have done more boyfriend shit. Maybe let Robb meet my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Robb already met your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant as my boyfriend, not my best friend since grade school.\u201d Theon paused as a realization hit him. \u201cOh fuck, does your whole family know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known since high school and you two weren\u2019t even dating them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! We still aren\u2019t dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke up then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were never together! Just because he says we were dating, doesn\u2019t mean I say it. That\u2019s not how that shit works. I mean, are we just declaring shit? Just saying words. Like I can say I\u2019ve been dating your mom for six years because I basically lived in your guys\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheon, the fuck-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry; I thought we were just saying shit.\u201d He fell back against Jon\u2019s couch, hugging the pillow to his chest. \u201cYou know what the worst part is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh gods, there is a worst part to all this nonsense?\u201d</p><p>Theon glared at him, but continued on, \u201cRobb doesn\u2019t even think it is a big deal. Not until I got upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to take his side on that one,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cWhy you always have to take his side? Just because you guys are related?\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at Theon. \u201cReally? Not because you are a dick <i>all the time</i>?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cWhatever. Maybe it isn\u2019t a big deal to you guys, but it is to me.\u201d</p><p>Before Jon could even untangle that line of thinking, a soft knock came from his door. Jon stood to get it but Theon grabbed Jon\u2019s arm, yanking him back.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s Robb,\u201d Theon hissed quietly. \u201cPretend you aren\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can probably see my car in the parking lot, idiot.\u201d Jon wrestled his arm from Theon\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to see him,\u201d Theon hissed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not my problem then, is it?\u201d Jon snapped back. \u201cYou should\u2019ve gone somewhere else to be a dramatic idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBro, I thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t even bother tackling that one and instead opened the door to see Robb there, hands deep in his pockets and his eyes downturned. Jon didn\u2019t even speak; he just opened the door wider to Robb to step through.</p><p>Jon watched as Robb and Theon\u2019s eyes met. Sadness and anger clashing in uncomfortable silence. Robb had yet to say a word, just staring at Theon hopelessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make coffee,\u201d Jon muttered, trying to leave to room.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Theon said, standing up. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d He threw Jon a hateful look. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are picking him over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have ever guessed that?\u201d Jon muttered.</p><p>It went unanswered as Theon tried to walk past Robb but was stopped. The two stared at each other, communicating telepathically or some shit. Jon didn\u2019t know. He used to always get frustrated that the two of them could be having a completely silent conversation while Jon sat there lost.</p><p>Jon tried to understand what was being said, or really what wasn\u2019t as the two stared. Robb\u2019s hand was tight on Theon\u2019s wrist, tugging or maybe pleading. They stared unblinkingly at each other. Jon thought, for a moment, he could see Theon\u2019s face soften and Robb\u2019s eyes brighten.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Theon muttered gently to Robb before turning to Jon. \u201cDickhead, we\u2019re using your room to talk.\u201d</p><p>Jon just stood and watched as Theon and Robb disappeared down the hall, the door to his room shutting softly behind them. \u00a0Jon felt like the past twenty minutes had been six hours. He was exhausted, confused and quite frankly just done with this nonsense.</p><p>Minutes ticked by in silence. Jon could just barely hear the faint murmur of them speaking as he went about making coffee, something to set his head back on straight and dull his headache. Once that was finished, he sat back in his chair and tried to read his book again, but ever couple of sentences his eyes would drift up towards the wall clock and down the hall.</p><p>Nearly half an hour and three cups of coffee later, the door to his room creaked open. Jon tried not to look eager as he watched the two walk side by side down, the hall. Their hands were intertwined and both seemed to be walking on air. Jon let out a breath of relief.</p><p>\u201cAll good then?\u201d Jon asked hesitantly. He could never tell with these two.</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d Robb grinned brightly.</p><p>\u201cAll sorted,\u201d Theon nodded with a faint smirk. \u201cAlso, you owe us a gift.\u201d</p><p>Jon blinked. \u201c<i>Why?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be rude not to get the happy couple a gift on their anniversary,\u201d Theon explained. \u201cAnd you\u2019re three months late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t dating until yesterday!\u201d Jon threw his hands up in the air.</p><p>\u201cWe decided we\u2019ve been dating for about fifteen months,\u201d Robb said sheepishly.

Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already taken the liberty to write our anniversary in it so you won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Jon could only bury his head in his hands in dismay. \u201cJust get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Jon!\u201d Robb waved, sending an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cLater, dickhead.\u201d</p>",

He took the decision right out from under me.\u201d</p><p>Jon quirked up his eyebrow. \u201cHe never forced you to kiss him and live with him.\u201d</p><p>Theon deflated a bit, only a bit. \u201cWell, no, he never forced anything. But like, dating is serious shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dated half of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Snow, Jon, idiot boy, that wasn\u2019t dating.\u201d Theon dragged his hand down his face in exhausted. \u201cThat was messing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all this time you thought you were messing around with Robb?\u201d Now Jon was beginning to feel a bit angry. \u201cPlease tell me you weren\u2019t seeing other people too.\u201d</p><p>Theon flinched at the accusation. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not that. But I would have been like, nicer or some shit. If I knew we were dating, I would have done more boyfriend shit. Maybe let Robb meet my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Robb already met your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant as my boyfriend, not my best friend since grade school.\u201d Theon paused as a realization hit him. \u201cOh fuck, does your whole family know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known since high school and you two weren\u2019t even dating them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! We still aren\u2019t dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke up then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were never together! Just because he says we were dating, doesn\u2019t mean I say it. That\u2019s not how that shit works. I mean, are we just declaring shit? Just saying words. Like I can say I\u2019ve been dating your mom for six years because I basically lived in your guys\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheon, the fuck-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry; I thought we were just saying shit.\u201d He fell back against Jon\u2019s couch, hugging the pillow to his chest. \u201cYou know what the worst part is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh gods, there is a worst part to all this nonsense?\u201d</p><p>Theon glared at him, but continued on, \u201cRobb doesn\u2019t even think it is a big deal. Not until I got upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to take his side on that one,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cWhy you always have to take his side? Just because you guys are related?\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at Theon. \u201cReally? Not because you are a dick <i>all the time</i>?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cWhatever. Maybe it isn\u2019t a big deal to you guys, but it is to me.\u201d</p><p>Before Jon could even untangle that line of thinking, a soft knock came from his door. Jon stood to get it but Theon grabbed Jon\u2019s arm, yanking him back.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s Robb,\u201d Theon hissed quietly. \u201cPretend you aren\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can probably see my car in the parking lot, idiot.\u201d Jon wrestled his arm from Theon\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to see him,\u201d Theon hissed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not my problem then, is it?\u201d Jon snapped back. \u201cYou should\u2019ve gone somewhere else to be a dramatic idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBro, I thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t even bother tackling that one and instead opened the door to see Robb there, hands deep in his pockets and his eyes downturned. Jon didn\u2019t even speak; he just opened the door wider to Robb to step through.</p><p>Jon watched as Robb and Theon\u2019s eyes met. Sadness and anger clashing in uncomfortable silence. Robb had yet to say a word, just staring at Theon hopelessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make coffee,\u201d Jon muttered, trying to leave to room.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Theon said, standing up. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d He threw Jon a hateful look. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are picking him over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have ever guessed that?\u201d Jon muttered.</p><p>It went unanswered as Theon tried to walk past Robb but was stopped. The two stared at each other, communicating telepathically or some shit. Jon didn\u2019t know. He used to always get frustrated that the two of them could be having a completely silent conversation while Jon sat there lost.</p><p>Jon tried to understand what was being said, or really what wasn\u2019t as the two stared. Robb\u2019s hand was tight on Theon\u2019s wrist, tugging or maybe pleading. They stared unblinkingly at each other. Jon thought, for a moment, he could see Theon\u2019s face soften and Robb\u2019s eyes brighten.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Theon muttered gently to Robb before turning to Jon. \u201cDickhead, we\u2019re using your room to talk.\u201d</p><p>Jon just stood and watched as Theon and Robb disappeared down the hall, the door to his room shutting softly behind them. \u00a0Jon felt like the past twenty minutes had been six hours. He was exhausted, confused and quite frankly just done with this nonsense.</p><p>Minutes ticked by in silence. Jon could just barely hear the faint murmur of them speaking as he went about making coffee, something to set his head back on straight and dull his headache. Once that was finished, he sat back in his chair and tried to read his book again, but ever couple of sentences his eyes would drift up towards the wall clock and down the hall.</p><p>Nearly half an hour and three cups of coffee later, the door to his room creaked open. Jon tried not to look eager as he watched the two walk side by side down, the hall. Their hands were intertwined and both seemed to be walking on air. Jon let out a breath of relief.</p><p>\u201cAll good then?\u201d Jon asked hesitantly. He could never tell with these two.</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d Robb grinned brightly.</p><p>\u201cAll sorted,\u201d Theon nodded with a faint smirk. \u201cAlso, you owe us a gift.\u201d</p><p>Jon blinked. \u201c<i>Why?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be rude not to get the happy couple a gift on their anniversary,\u201d Theon explained. \u201cAnd you\u2019re three months late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t dating until yesterday!\u201d Jon threw his hands up in the air.</p><p>\u201cWe decided we\u2019ve been dating for about fifteen months,\u201d Robb said sheepishly. He went on to explain, \u201cWe traced back our history and decided it would be silly to say we started dating yesterday when in actuality we\u2019ve been acting like a couple for much longer than that\u2026it\u2019s a bit complicated but we\u2019ve sorted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we picked an anniversary. June 8<sup>th</sup>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy June 8<sup>th</sup>?\u201d Jon asked, though he knew the answer would make just as much sense as this whole afternoon has been.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Robb shrugged. \u201cIt sounds like a nice date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also <i>World Oceans Day</i> according to the calendar on your desk. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already taken the liberty to write our anniversary in it so you won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Jon could only bury his head in his hands in dismay. \u201cJust get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Jon!\u201d Robb waved, sending an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cLater, dickhead.\u201d</p>",

Jon looked around to see if Robb had magically appeared as well considering Theon never came to Jon&rsquo;s apartment alone. Jon wasn&rsquo;t even aware Theon had a key.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh why-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, he can&rsquo;t just assume things! That&rsquo;s not how the world works. What&rsquo;s that stupid saying Bran always says? &nbsp;&lsquo;Assumptions make an ass out of you and me?&rsquo; Well, it&rsquo;s right. I feel like an ass and Robb is an even bigger ass.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon snapped his mouth shut and rewound the last few seconds in his head to see if he had missed something as to why Theon was pouting on his couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you and Robb get in a fight?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>He set down the book he was reading and awkwardly tried to put on a face of sympathy. In the instances of Robb and Theon&rsquo;s fights, Robb was usually the one to lay on Jon&rsquo;s couch and vent. It was rare for Theon to ever come to Jon, especially for emotional venting. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No shit,&rdquo; Theon muttered. &ldquo;Maybe dumbassary runs through your family.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon raised an eyebrow, any form of sympathy melting away with irritation. &ldquo;Maybe you should leave.&rdquo; Jon stood up, ready to throw Theon out the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, no, wait.&rdquo; Theon screwed his face together in pain as he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;</p><p>Now Jon was completely confused. It was already unusual for Theon and him to be alone and talking&hellip;it was unheard of for Theon to apologize. The only person Theon even showed common human decency to was Robb.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a big fight then, yeah?&rdquo; Jon reclaimed his seat in the armchair.</p><p>Theon didn&rsquo;t answer the question, just stewing in his anger and glaring up at the ceiling. Jon wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure how to tackle the subject and just sat in silence, waiting for Theon to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;He thinks we are dating.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Theon sat up rapidly and shot Jon a look of betrayal. &ldquo;Not you too?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think we all thought you were dating,&rdquo; Jon admitted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Theon yelled, grabbing the pillow off Jon&rsquo;s couch and holding it to his face to scream.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this a homophobic thing?&rdquo; Jon asked gently. &ldquo;Because if it is-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Robb and I have fucked. That&rsquo;s not the problem.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon grimaced. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need to know that.&rdquo; Theon didn&rsquo;t look the least bit sorry, but rather a bit smug. At least he wasn&rsquo;t screaming though that look was equally annoying. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re not dating?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Theon hissed, throwing the pillow aside. &ldquo;I was going to ask him yesterday. Make that shit official.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Jon wasn&rsquo;t sure he was seeing a problem here. &ldquo;And-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I made reservations that the sushi place! The expensive one by the riverside. And I was going to make the whole thing romantic and classy. I put a lot of thought into this shit and he had the audacity to say he thought we were already dating. Without my consent.&rdquo; Theon laid back on the couch once again, mimicking a dramatic renaissance painting with his hand thrown over his eyes and his chicken legs draped over the couch arm</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m missing something. Did you not want to date Robb?&rdquo; Jon asked, rubbing his temples. He could feel himself getting a headache.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck yeah, I wanted to date him. Since high school.&rdquo; Jon felt like that was a revelation that shouldn&rsquo;t just be glossed over but Theon continued on anyway, &ldquo;But he just assumed we were.
