She was a force to be reckoned with and when she got it in her head to go to a casino, well, he couldn&rsquo;t very well let her go by herself. Not when she came all this way to listen to him &lsquo;brag about himself.&rsquo;</p><p>Her words, not his.</p><p>So, after the award ceremony, Stephen trailed behind Christine, still in his overpriced suit and her in a fire engine red dress, her hair artfully tucked over a bare shoulder. Stephen wished he still felt something towards her that wasn&rsquo;t just respect and fondness. It&rsquo;d make life easier for him if he felt about her the same way he felt for men. And besides, Christine wasn&rsquo;t only just there to gamble.</p><p>The casino was loud and bright. Obnoxious. Stephen got so swept up in the lights and the people, he failed to notice Christine slipping away. When he did realize, it was too late to call out, she was completely out of sight and Stephen was completely alone. With no one to talk to and with nothing to do, he found himself wandering.</p><p>He strolled from table to table, easily sidestepping wandering hands of leery eyed woman and at one point, accidentally bumping into a moderately tall, military dressed man, the figurine he was holding painfully jabbed him in \u00a0the abdomen. With a quick apology, Stephen avoided a confrontation and headed in the opposite direction of the determined man, who continued on his way towards a table that was quickly gathering a crowd of lascivious women. </p><p>Needing a breath of fresh air from all the smoke and heavily perfumed men and women, Stephen headed back towards the exit. Somehow luck was on his side, as Stephen found himself out by a fountain. As he tried to call Christine, Stephen stepped aside for a group taking a picture in front of the fountain. </p><p>\u201cChristine,\u201d Stephen started when the dial tone sounded. \u201cI don&rsquo;t know where you went, but if you&rsquo;re looking for me I&rsquo;m heading back to the hotel. I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow morning.\u201d As an afterthought, he tacked on a quick, \u201cbe safe.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and turned just in time to see, a short man pass off the figurine Stephen had been jabbed with to one of the tourists taking picture. Squinting his eyes, Stephen noticed that figurine was actually an award, almost like the one he&rsquo;d received a few hours earlier. The man stared after the shorter one, a confused expression on his face, which Stephen couldn&rsquo;t blame him for, not when the man had also snuck himself into the photo op before heading past Stephen with a wink.</p><p>Stephen rolled his eyes and tucked his phone into his pants pocket, deciding to try and catch a cab instead of waiting for an Uber. It <i>was</i> Malibu, there had to be at least one free cab, especially outside a casino. </p><p>Finally making it outside, Stephen was able to take a deep breath of crisp, refreshing Malibu air. It cleared the smells of the casino right out of his sinuses, making way for the smell of traffic, distant salt water and city fumes. A distant ache for New York struck through him, as the smells brought on a sense of deja vu, bringing memories of his home. It also allowed Stephen to clear his head and focus on the task of getting back to the hotel. </p><p>The first two taxis flew by, the third and fourth turned their lights off just as he started to turn towards them and the last slowed down, but bypassed him for a pair of pretty legs in a brown pencil skirt.</p><p>\u201cHuh. I can&rsquo;t see the contest,\u201d Stephen rolled his eyes and turned back to where the voice spoke. It was the same man who had winked at him. </p><p>He let out a short huff, \u201cwell, of course there isn&rsquo;t. What kind of man pushes away <i>that-</i>\u201d he gestured to the quickly disappearing blonde, then back to himself. \u201cFor <i>this?</i>\u201d </p><p>The man stared for moment, his gaze assessing and something he couldn&rsquo;t place lingering in those hazel-green eyes. \u201cUnfortunately for her, <i><span style=\"color: #444444\">I</span></i> did.\u201d</p><p>Both eyebrows rose at that, Stephen couldn&rsquo;t believe a man that looked like <i>that</i> would pass up a chance to get laid for someone like Stephen. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d He couldn&rsquo;t help, but step away from the road, his task of finding a taxi put on the backburner. </p><p>The man honest to god <i>wiggled</i> his eyebrows, ripping the shades he was wearing to make it more obvious. \u201cHow about I tell you all about back at my place?\u201d Stephen should&rsquo;ve said no, he really should&rsquo;ve said no and he meant to, but the word that came out was most definitely <i>not</i> a no.</p><p>\u201cAlright, but I&rsquo;d like to know the man behind the mask before I sleep with them,\u201d he stepped forward and made a bold decision to flick the man&rsquo;s sunglasses. </p><p>\u201cYou really don&rsquo;t know who I am?\u201d The man grinned, and subtly snuck an arm around Stephen&rsquo;s waist, gently leading him to his car, where a broad chested man stood with the back door open.

                "content": "<p><b>Instead of Christine Everheart meeting Tony at the start of Iron Man, we get Tony and Stephen meet-cute. Stephen&rsquo;s in Malibu for a Doctor&rsquo;s fundraiser/award ceremony or something and Tony&rsquo;s there for the same reason as he is in the movie.</b> </p><p><b>End result: <i>they somehow get married during the night</i>, which is possible since Las Vegas is only 4 hours (excluding traffic) from Malibu. They could totally do a fly by in one of Tony&rsquo;s jets and be back within 2 hrs, since the flight takes an hour to get there.</b></p><p><b>Although, my thing would be that they never really tell anyone except Pepper, Happy, Rhodey and Christine since it wasn&rsquo;t really a priority. Happy was their witness when they went to Las Vegas &#128276;&#128141;.</b></p><p><b>This is a fic in the works as of right now. Thank you for listening to my Ted-Talk. Now here&rsquo;s a taste of what it&rsquo;s shaping out to be.</b></p><p>~&bull;&#9679;&bull;~</p><p>Stephen hadn&rsquo;t planned on going to the casino, but when it came to Christine Palmer- Stephen had no defense to combat her. She was a force to be reckoned with and when she got it in her head to go to a casino, well, he couldn&rsquo;t very well let her go by herself. Not when she came all this way to listen to him &lsquo;brag about himself.&rsquo;</p><p>Her words, not his.</p><p>So, after the award ceremony, Stephen trailed behind Christine, still in his overpriced suit and her in a fire engine red dress, her hair artfully tucked over a bare shoulder. Stephen wished he still felt something towards her that wasn&rsquo;t just respect and fondness. It&rsquo;d make life easier for him if he felt about her the same way he felt for men. And besides, Christine wasn&rsquo;t only just there to gamble.</p><p>The casino was loud and bright. Obnoxious. Stephen got so swept up in the lights and the people, he failed to notice Christine slipping away. When he did realize, it was too late to call out, she was completely out of sight and Stephen was completely alone. With no one to talk to and with nothing to do, he found himself wandering.</p><p>He strolled from table to table, easily sidestepping wandering hands of leery eyed woman and at one point, accidentally bumping into a moderately tall, military dressed man, the figurine he was holding painfully jabbed him in &nbsp;the abdomen. With a quick apology, Stephen avoided a confrontation and headed in the opposite direction of the determined man, who continued on his way towards a table that was quickly gathering a crowd of lascivious women. </p><p>Needing a breath of fresh air from all the smoke and heavily perfumed men and women, Stephen headed back towards the exit.
