Because the real answer to your question, the one you so blatantly and disrespectfully hid behind the mask of a sexual interaction, is that no, my opinion or experience of what actually happened is not influenced by any feelings or connections I have to Harry. And quite frankly your question, as well as the smug look on your face, is insulting.",

Georgia pulls up to your apartment, you hug her and say thanks. You wave as she drives away.</p><p>When you get into your apartment, you immediately rip off the clothes Harry lent you, they smelt just like him and it wasn&rsquo;t helping you get him out of your mind.\u00a0</p><p>When you left out the door, Harry sat down on his couch, head in his hands, and thought about how he just ruined something that was so good. He didn't\u00a0know why he agreed in the first place, when he first laid eyes on you he knew he would end up flirting with you all night anyway.</p><p>Alex noticed Harry&rsquo;s fondness for you and proposed the bet. With all his friends telling him to do it, he felt a pressure to please them, impress them.

I need to tell her I\u2019m sorry\u201d he pleads.</p><p>\u201cHarry I have to go,\u201d Alex says and hangs up the phone.\u00a0</p><p>Harry knew he needed to find a way to make it up to her.</p><p>It\u2019s now Monday, and after spending the rest of the weekend feeling sorry for yourself you decided to push it behind you. You had a class at 2pm, so you took the morning slow.\u00a0You went to a yoga and treated yourself to an iced coffee. This was the start of a new week.</p><p>You sit in the lecture hall, listening to the professor\u00a0go on about the history of fashion. This was your least favorite\u00a0class, but you still turned up, most of the time.</p><p>You start daydreaming, replaying the events of Saturday night. Kissing Harry, laughing with him. You then hear your name being called. Snapping back into reality you look at the professor, but it isn&rsquo;t him calling you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d The voice coming from behind you. You turn around in your seat and Harry is standing there. Everyone in the class is also looking at him with a shocked face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir, you are disrupting this class\u201d the professor says to Harry.</p><p>You get up grabbing your bag, and quickly walk out the door, you can feel the stares from your classmates burning into your back. Harry follows you out the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI bet you don't\u00a0want to see me, but I came to give your dress back, and to say sorry\u201d he says handing you a bag with your dress in it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stop with the betting\u201d you snap and then snatch the bag from him. \u201cHow did you even find me Harry, did Georgia tell you where I would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn&rsquo;t help me. I\u2019ve been here all day, walking into random classes trying to find you\u201d\u00a0he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell Harry?\u201d you quiz him.</p><p>&ldquo;I just needed to find you and apologize,&rdquo; he says. You&rsquo;re still walking and he just follows behind you. He then takes your hand to stop you from walking further, but you keep going and you are then jerked back towards him as he doesn&rsquo;t let go of your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry I thought I made myself clear. I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you&rdquo; you say sternly.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to talk, just listen&rdquo; he&rsquo;s still holding your hand, and you pull away.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Please just go!&rdquo; you say raising your voice which draws attention from someone passing by.</p><p>&ldquo;Mate, listen to the lady, she doesn&rsquo;t want to see you&rdquo; The voice is familiar, it belongs to your problematic ex-boyfriend Ryan. What are the fucking chances he happens to walk by right at this moment?</p><p>&ldquo;Ryan please leave, I can handle this on my own&rdquo; you say backing away from both of them.</p><p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; Harry questions pointing to Ryan.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, this is my girl, so you should get leaving pal,&rdquo; Ryan says putting his arm around you, pulling you close into him. You can instantly smell old cigarettes, one of the things that made you dump him.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a boyfriend?&rdquo; Harry asks angrily.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my boyfriend, and I&rsquo;m not your girl&rdquo; you say shoving Ryan off you.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me take you home baby, away from this creep&rdquo; Ryan says.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off Ryan, I&rsquo;m not your baby, I broke up with you!&rdquo; you shriek out at him. Ryan backs away, hands up in defense as Harry is giving him the eye.</p><p>&ldquo;You have 2 minutes&rdquo; you say turning to Harry. You sit down on a nearby bench. Ryan thankfully left without causing more problems, that&rsquo;s new for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N I should have never agreed to the bet, I feel like an asshole. You were all I could think about for the last few days, please forgive me. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>You pause pretending to think about his apology, you knew you were going to forgive him, but you liked to see him pour his heart out to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I have never felt such a connection to someone I just met, then I went and fucked it up,&rdquo; he throws his hands up in frustration, then stops &ldquo;I understand if you don&rsquo;t forgive me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I forgive you Harry&rdquo; you say plainly. His face is shocked, then he smiles widely.</p><p>&ldquo;Ca-can I take you out for dinner tonight?&rdquo; he says quickly before you change your mind.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Pick me up at 7&rdquo; you say standing up, walking away. Harry is left sitting on the bench watching you in awe comprehending that he was given a second chance.</p><p>He arrives at your apartment exactly at 7 pm. He nocks 3 times on your door, and you open it with a big smile on your face. &ldquo;Wow, you look stunning&rdquo; Harry stutters out.</p><p>&ldquo;Not too bad yourself,&rdquo; you say smugly. He then pulls you in for a hug, and as you pull away you kiss him. You missed his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; he questions while holding his arm out for you to take. Arms linked, you lean your lead on his shoulder as you walk out to his car. He opens the door for you, and you get in. The car ride was quiet. You kept catching him looking at you up and down, as you stop at a red light, it then turns green but Harry is distracted by you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, eyes on the road&rdquo; you say teasingly, he quickly recuperates and continues driving. You were just as bad, he was looking particularly handsome this evening. Wearing a white shirt, with only 2 buttons done up, it leads you to gaze at his chest, remembering the feeling of it under your fingertips.</p><p>You quickly look away and breathe in deep, he&rsquo;s really getting you wound up. Again he&rsquo;s wearing black skinny jeans, and Gucci boots. His hair is effortlessly styles to one side, and you just want to run your fingers through his soft curls.</p><p>As he pulls up into a parking spot he stops the car and looks at you, his stare made you break the eye contact as remembering the night you spent together was making you feel flushed in the cheeks.</p><p>At the same time, you both urgently lean into each other and kiss. At first, the kiss was slow, but you tangle your fingers through his curls and start unbuttoning the last 2 buttons of his shirt and push it over his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna miss our reservation,&rdquo; he says between kisses while helping you take his shirt off.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; you say. You climb out of your seat and place yourself in his lap so you can kiss him harder and faster. &ldquo;Ever fucked someone in a car?&rdquo; you giggle to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I have&rdquo; You pull off your shirt, and unclip your bra, Harry gazes over your chest and starts kissing your neck. &ldquo;S-someone is gonna see us&rdquo; Harry says against your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Are your back windows tinted?&rdquo; you ask.</p><p>He stops looks up at you and smirks. \u201cThey sure are&quot; You hop off Harry and climb into the back seat. Harry follows at a lot less graceful than you, as he is much bigger.</p><p>You unbuckle his belt and unzip his fly. He then takes off his pants. He pushes your skirt up and rips down your panties. He stops to fond over your heat.</p><p>&ldquo;Your dripping wet babe&rdquo; he says smirking to himself. He then slips down his boxers and rubs his rock hard dick between your folds, making you squirm with pleasure. He pushes into you and starts moving quickly.</p><p>You can feel the car moving from his thrusting, and he\u2019s already got you screaming out his name. Then you hear voices outside of the car, and Harry stops and places his hand over your mouth, keeping deep inside you.</p><p>\u201cShh love&quot; he whispers into your ear. When he hears their footsteps walking away, he picks up his speed again.</p><p>He quickly pushed you over your edge, and you moan his name out. After you come down from your orgasm, he then rides out his. Releasing his load into you, he then slowly pulls out of you. He just smiles at you.</p><p>\u201cWe can still make the reservation\u201d he says out of breath while looking at his watch.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought, let\u2019s just go back to yours\u201d you say seductively while sitting up and pulling him closer to you so you can kiss him.</p><p>\u201cG-good idea\u201d he stutters out while pulling his boxers back up and jumping back in the driver&rsquo;s seat before you can even begin to find your knickers.</p><p>You just stay in the back seat until he pulls up to his driveway. He opens the back door of the car and he picks you up. He carries you into his house and throws you on the leather couch where you sat the other night.</p><p>This was the start of something amazing.</p>",

You had a class at 2pm, so you took the morning slow.\u00a0You went to a yoga and treated yourself to an iced coffee. This was the start of a new week.</p><p>You sit in the lecture hall, listening to the professor\u00a0go on about the history of fashion. This was your least favorite\u00a0class, but you still turned up, most of the time.</p><p>You start daydreaming, replaying the events of Saturday night. Kissing Harry, laughing with him. You then hear your name being called. Snapping back into reality you look at the professor, but it isn\u2019t him calling you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d The voice coming from behind you. You turn around in your seat and Harry is standing there. Everyone in the class is also looking at him with a shocked face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir, you are disrupting this class\u201d the professor says to Harry.</p><p>You get up grabbing your bag, and quickly walk out the door, you can feel the stares from your classmates burning into your back.

I\u2019ve been here all day, walking into random classes trying to find you\u201d\u00a0he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell Harry?\u201d you quiz him.</p><p>\u201cI just needed to find you and apologize,\u201d he says. You\u2019re still walking and he just follows behind you. He then takes your hand to stop you from walking further, but you keep going and you are then jerked back towards him as he doesn\u2019t let go of your hand.</p><p>\u201cHarry I thought I made myself clear. I don\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d you say sternly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk, just listen\u201d he\u2019s still holding your hand, and you pull away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease just go!\u201d you say raising your voice which draws attention from someone passing by.</p><p>\u201cMate, listen to the lady, she doesn\u2019t want to see you\u201d The voice is familiar, it belongs to your problematic ex-boyfriend Ryan. What are the fucking chances he happens to walk by right at this moment?</p><p>\u201cRyan please leave, I can handle this on my own\u201d you say backing away from both of them.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Harry questions pointing to Ryan.</p><p>\u201cYeah, this is my girl, so you should get leaving pal,\u201d Ryan says putting his arm around you, pulling you close into him. You can instantly smell old cigarettes, one of the things that made you dump him.</p><p>\u201cYou have a boyfriend?\u201d Harry asks angrily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend, and I\u2019m not your girl\u201d you say shoving Ryan off you.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you home baby, away from this creep\u201d Ryan says.</p><p>\u201cFuck off Ryan, I\u2019m not your baby, I broke up with you!\u201d you shriek out at him. Ryan backs away, hands up in defense as Harry is giving him the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou have 2 minutes\u201d you say turning to Harry. You sit down on a nearby bench. Ryan thankfully left without causing more problems, that\u2019s new for him.</p><p>\u201cY/N I should have never agreed to the bet, I feel like an asshole. You were all I could think about for the last few days, please forgive me. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>You pause pretending to think about his apology, you knew you were going to forgive him, but you liked to see him pour his heart out to you.</p><p>\u201cI have never felt such a connection to someone I just met, then I went and fucked it up,\u201d he throws his hands up in frustration, then stops \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t forgive me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgive you Harry\u201d you say plainly. His face is shocked, then he smiles widely.</p><p>\u201cCa-can I take you out for dinner tonight?\u201d he says quickly before you change your mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPick me up at 7\u201d you say standing up, walking away. Harry is left sitting on the bench watching you in awe comprehending that he was given a second chance.</p><p>He arrives at your apartment exactly at 7 pm. He nocks 3 times on your door, and you open it with a big smile on your face. \u201cWow, you look stunning\u201d Harry stutters out.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad yourself,\u201d you say smugly. He then pulls you in for a hug, and as you pull away you kiss him. You missed his lips.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d he questions while holding his arm out for you to take. Arms linked, you lean your lead on his shoulder as you walk out to his car. He opens the door for you, and you get in. The car ride was quiet. You kept catching him looking at you up and down, as you stop at a red light, it then turns green but Harry is distracted by you.</p><p>\u201cHey, eyes on the road\u201d you say teasingly, he quickly recuperates and continues driving. You were just as bad, he was looking particularly handsome this evening. Wearing a white shirt, with only 2 buttons done up, it leads you to gaze at his chest, remembering the feeling of it under your fingertips.</p><p>You quickly look away and breathe in deep, he\u2019s really getting you wound up. Again he\u2019s wearing black skinny jeans, and Gucci boots. His hair is effortlessly styles to one side, and you just want to run your fingers through his soft curls.</p><p>As he pulls up into a parking spot he stops the car and looks at you, his stare made you break the eye contact as remembering the night you spent together was making you feel flushed in the cheeks.</p><p>At the same time, you both urgently lean into each other and kiss. At first, the kiss was slow, but you tangle your fingers through his curls and start unbuttoning the last 2 buttons of his shirt and push it over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna miss our reservation,\u201d he says between kisses while helping you take his shirt off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d you say. You climb out of your seat and place yourself in his lap so you can kiss him harder and faster. \u201cEver fucked someone in a car?\u201d you giggle to him.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have\u201d You pull off your shirt, and unclip your bra, Harry gazes over your chest and starts kissing your neck. \u201cS-someone is gonna see us\u201d Harry says against your skin.</p><p>\u201cAre your back windows tinted?\u201d you ask.</p><p>He stops looks up at you and smirks. \u201cThey sure are\" You hop off Harry and climb into the back seat. Harry follows at a lot less graceful than you, as he is much bigger.</p><p>You unbuckle his belt and unzip his fly. He then takes off his pants. He pushes your skirt up and rips down your panties. He stops to fond over your heat.</p><p>\u201cYour dripping wet babe\u201d he says smirking to himself. He then slips down his boxers and rubs his rock hard dick between your folds, making you squirm with pleasure. He pushes into you and starts moving quickly.</p><p>You can feel the car moving from his thrusting, and he\u2019s already got you screaming out his name.

You kept catching him looking at you up and down, as you stop at a red light, it then turns green but Harry is distracted by you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, eyes on the road&rdquo; you say teasingly, he quickly recuperates and continues driving. You were just as bad, he was looking particularly handsome this evening. Wearing a white shirt, with only 2 buttons done up, it leads you to gaze at his chest, remembering the feeling of it under your fingertips.</p><p>You quickly look away and breathe in deep, he&rsquo;s really getting you wound up. Again he&rsquo;s wearing black skinny jeans, and Gucci boots. His hair is effortlessly styles to one side, and you just want to run your fingers through his soft curls.</p><p>As he pulls up into a parking spot he stops the car and looks at you, his stare made you break the eye contact as remembering the night you spent together was making you feel flushed in the cheeks.</p><p>At the same time, you both urgently lean into each other and kiss. At first, the kiss was slow, but you tangle your fingers through his curls and start unbuttoning the last 2 buttons of his shirt and push it over his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna miss our reservation,&rdquo; he says between kisses while helping you take his shirt off.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; you say. You climb out of your seat and place yourself in his lap so you can kiss him harder and faster. &ldquo;Ever fucked someone in a car?&rdquo; you giggle to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I have&rdquo; You pull off your shirt, and unclip your bra, Harry gazes over your chest and starts kissing your neck. &ldquo;S-someone is gonna see us&rdquo; Harry says against your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Are your back windows tinted?&rdquo; you ask.</p><p>He stops looks up at you and smirks. &ldquo;They sure are\" You hop off Harry and climb into the back seat. Harry follows at a lot less graceful than you, as he is much bigger.</p><p>You unbuckle his belt and unzip his fly. He then takes off his pants. He pushes your skirt up and rips down your panties. He stops to fond over your heat.</p><p>&ldquo;Your dripping wet babe&rdquo; he says smirking to himself. He then slips down his boxers and rubs his rock hard dick between your folds, making you squirm with pleasure. He pushes into you and starts moving quickly.</p><p>You can feel the car moving from his thrusting, and he&rsquo;s already got you screaming out his name. Then you hear voices outside of the car, and Harry stops and places his hand over your mouth, keeping deep inside you.</p><p>&ldquo;Shh love\" he whispers into your ear. When he hears their footsteps walking away, he picks up his speed again.</p><p>He quickly pushed you over your edge, and you moan his name out. After you come down from your orgasm, he then rides out his. Releasing his load into you, he then slowly pulls out of you. He just smiles at you.</p><p>&ldquo;We can still make the reservation&rdquo; he says out of breath while looking at his watch.</p><p>&ldquo;On second thought, let&rsquo;s just go back to yours&rdquo; you say seductively while sitting up and pulling him closer to you so you can kiss him.</p><p>&ldquo;G-good idea&rdquo; he stutters out while pulling his boxers back up and jumping back in the driver&rsquo;s seat before you can even begin to find your knickers.</p><p>You just stay in the back seat until he pulls up to his driveway. He opens the back door of the car and he picks you up. He carries you into his house and throws you on the leather couch where you sat the other night.</p><p>This was the start of something amazing.</p></p>",
