Cyrus arrives first and sits on a bench whilst he waits. As the warm sun is beaming down, Cyrus begins to overthink things.\u00a0<i>What if I attempt a handstand and break my arm and then I\u2019m unfit to try anything else on my list and the best summer ever is over before it had much of a chance to begin?</i></p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re\u00a0panicking.\u201d TJ purposely sneaks up on Cyrus and it causes him to jump. TJ slides in next to him on the park bench with an amused chuckle.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always\u00a0panicking,\u201d Cyrus frowns,\u00a0\u201cand even more so now that you\u2019ve scared me.\u201d Cyrus adds with a playful shove to TJ\u2019s arm.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ pretends like it hurt and the two\u00a0laugh it off.\u00a0\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, I was packing supplies.\u201d TJ pulls his backpack onto his lap and pats it gently.</p><p>\u201cSupplies?\u201d Cyrus knits his brows together.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell for starters I made a hard copy of the list,\u201d\u00a0TJ wears an excited smile as he unzips his backpack.<br/></p><p>\u201cI love hard copies of things.\u201d Cyrus gleams.</p><p>\u201cThat way it\u2019s rewarding to physically cross something off the list.\u201d TJ bops his head.\u00a0\u201cMy printer was out of ink so I just wrote them down myself.\u201d TJ explains as he hands Cyrus a sheet of paper.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus holds the torn page from one of TJ\u2019s notebooks like he was just given the most precious gift. TJ had gone to the effort to write out all ninety-seven things from Cyrus\u2019 list and even decorated the margin with a few doodles.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI also brought a mat because grass makes me itchy- Well we didn\u2019t actually have a picnic mat at home so it\u2019s a bed sheet but same difference,\u201d TJ shrugs,\u00a0\u201cOh and my mom packed us snacks. She says she doesn\u2019t want me spending all my money on junk food over the summer.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus doesn\u2019t even try to hide his smile at the effort TJ put into the day. Cyrus thinks about how he spent the morning contemplating bringing his vest - the one he wears to Jonah\u2019s frisbee matches -\u00a0and how he decided he didn\u2019t want to look dorky so all he packed was sunblock for them both and here TJ was unapologetically unpacking supplies.\u00a0TJ\u2019s rather adorable planning changes Cyrus\u2019 panicked outlook on the first task - and those that will follow - into one more optimistic.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo we going to do this handstand or what?\u201d Cyrus asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s the right attitude!\u201d TJ jumps up from the bench.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The two pick a spot under the shade of a big tree. TJ lays out the bed sheet he brought and wastes no time showing Cyrus how easy it was to do a handstand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can\u2019t do?\u201d Cyrus coaxes his head to look at TJ whom is holding a handstand. TJ smiles and drops his position.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do a cartwheel.\u201d TJ says once he\u2019s sitting.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s on my list?\u201d Cyrus frowns.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll both be learning how to do one,\u201d TJ shrugs one shoulder,\u00a0\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus takes a deep breath and holds his arms up, he takes a step forward as if he was about to try but he stops and looks to TJ,\u00a0\u201cYou might want to move back a little, just in case.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ wriggles back to the far corner of the sheet and holds his hands together encouragingly as he waits for Cyrus to attempt his handstand.\u00a0Cyrus takes another breath but further procrastinates by tucking his patterned t-shirt into his pants.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus,\u201d TJ chants quietly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Finally Cyrus lunges forward but instead of kicking his legs up he just flops forward on his hands and knees. Cyrus lifts his head up and meets TJ\u2019s grimace.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d TJ nods lightly,\u00a0\u201cMaybe try kicking your legs up this time?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus lets out a heavy sigh and tries again and again and again and each time ends with a rather ungraceful flop to the ground. After hurtling himself forward doesn\u2019t work, Cyrus switches to two hands on the ground and light kicks of his legs upwards but it ends up being more of an amusing sight with his legs flailing about.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTry kick higher,\u201d TJ encourages,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll catch your legs.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick you in the face,\u201d Cyrus says in a panic as he holds his downward dog position.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTry not to do that.\u201d TJ laughs nervously.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus kicks up off the ground and his legs smack into TJ\u2019s arms as he failed to grab Cyrus. They try this a few times but it proved no such luck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too afraid I\u2019m going to hurt you.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cAnd I can hear children giggling at me and it\u2019s not helping my self-confidence.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a park, Underdog,\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cHearing children laughing is hardly unusual.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>After another few failed attempts and an entertaining mock yoga lesson from Cyrus, the two decide take a lunch break. TJ practically inhales his food and lays back on the part of the sheet that got direct sunlight.

She says she doesn\u2019t want me spending all my money on junk food over the summer.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus doesn\u2019t even try to hide his smile at the effort TJ put into the day. Cyrus thinks about how he spent the morning contemplating bringing his vest - the one he wears to Jonah\u2019s frisbee matches -\u00a0and how he decided he didn\u2019t want to look dorky so all he packed was sunblock for them both and here TJ was unapologetically unpacking supplies.\u00a0TJ\u2019s rather adorable planning changes Cyrus\u2019 panicked outlook on the first task - and those that will follow - into one more optimistic.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo we going to do this handstand or what?\u201d Cyrus asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s the right attitude!\u201d TJ jumps up from the bench.\u00a0<br></p><p>The two pick a spot under the shade of a big tree. TJ lays out the bed sheet he brought and wastes no time showing Cyrus how easy it was to do a handstand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can\u2019t do?\u201d Cyrus coaxes his head to look at TJ whom is holding a handstand. TJ smiles and drops his position.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do a cartwheel.\u201d TJ says once he\u2019s sitting.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s on my list?\u201d Cyrus frowns.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll both be learning how to do one,\u201d TJ shrugs one shoulder,\u00a0\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus takes a deep breath and holds his arms up, he takes a step forward as if he was about to try but he stops and looks to TJ,\u00a0\u201cYou might want to move back a little, just in case.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ wriggles back to the far corner of the sheet and holds his hands together encouragingly as he waits for Cyrus to attempt his handstand.\u00a0Cyrus takes another breath but further procrastinates by tucking his patterned t-shirt into his pants.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus,\u201d TJ chants quietly.\u00a0<br></p><p>Finally Cyrus lunges forward but instead of kicking his legs up he just flops forward on his hands and knees.

After hurtling himself forward doesn\u2019t work, Cyrus switches to two hands on the ground and light kicks of his legs upwards but it ends up being more of an amusing sight with his legs flailing about.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTry kick higher,\u201d TJ encourages,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll catch your legs.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick you in the face,\u201d Cyrus says in a panic as he holds his downward dog position.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTry not to do that.\u201d TJ laughs nervously.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus kicks up off the ground and his legs smack into TJ\u2019s arms as he failed to grab Cyrus. They try this a few times but it proved no such luck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too afraid I\u2019m going to hurt you.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cAnd I can hear children giggling at me and it\u2019s not helping my self-confidence.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a park, Underdog,\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cHearing children laughing is hardly unusual.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>After another few failed attempts and an entertaining mock yoga lesson from Cyrus, the two decide take a lunch break. TJ practically inhales his food and lays back on the part of the sheet that got direct sunlight. With sunglasses on he enjoys the rays as Cyrus sits in the shade and nibbles on the remainder of his sandwich. </p><p>\u201cSo is there anything else on the list that you can\u2019t do?\u201d Cyrus questions. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about can\u2019t but there are some things I haven\u2019t done, yeah.\u201d TJ \u00a0turns his head towards Cyrus.

Cyrus thinks about how he spent the morning contemplating bringing his vest - the one he wears to Jonah\u2019s frisbee matches -\u00a0and how he decided he didn\u2019t want to look dorky so all he packed was sunblock for them both and here TJ was unapologetically unpacking supplies.\u00a0TJ\u2019s rather adorable planning changes Cyrus\u2019 panicked outlook on the first task - and those that will follow - into one more optimistic.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo we going to do this handstand or what?\u201d Cyrus asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s the right attitude!\u201d TJ jumps up from the bench.\u00a0<br></p><p>The two pick a spot under the shade of a big tree.

After hurtling himself forward doesn\u2019t work, Cyrus switches to two hands on the ground and light kicks of his legs upwards but it ends up being more of an amusing sight with his legs flailing about.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTry kick higher,\u201d TJ encourages,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll catch your legs.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick you in the face,\u201d Cyrus says in a panic as he holds his downward dog position.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTry not to do that.\u201d TJ laughs nervously.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus kicks up off the ground and his legs smack into TJ\u2019s arms as he failed to grab Cyrus. They try this a few times but it proved no such luck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too afraid I\u2019m going to hurt you.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cAnd I can hear children giggling at me and it\u2019s not helping my self-confidence.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a park, Underdog,\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cHearing children laughing is hardly unusual.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>After another few failed attempts and an entertaining mock yoga lesson from Cyrus, the two decide take a lunch break. TJ practically inhales his food and lays back on the part of the sheet that got direct sunlight. With sunglasses on he enjoys the rays as Cyrus sits in the shade and nibbles on the remainder of his sandwich. </p><p>\u201cSo is there anything else on the list that you can\u2019t do?\u201d Cyrus questions. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about can\u2019t but there are some things I haven\u2019t done, yeah.\u201d TJ \u00a0turns his head towards Cyrus. His choice of words weren\u2019t meant to be braggy or overconfident. Cyrus smiles lightly at TJ\u2019s attitude and wished he could feel more like that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere are a few things on the list that didn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d TJ laughs quietly,\u00a0\u201clike \u2018horses\u2019, what does that even mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so big and scary.\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously. </p><p>\u201cSo you want to not be afraid of them?\u201d TJ questions, \u201cOr you want to ride one?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust,<i> horses.</i>\u201d Cyrus shrugs innocently as he had mindlessly added a few things on the list over time. </p><p>\u201cHorses.\u201d TJ laughs and he turns his head to the sky again to enjoy the warmth of the sun. </p><p>Eventually the two stop lounging around and return to their summer task with a new plan of attack..

Cyrus arrives first and sits on a bench whilst he waits. As the warm sun is beaming down, Cyrus begins to overthink things.&nbsp;<i>What if I attempt a handstand and break my arm and then I&rsquo;m unfit to try anything else on my list and the best summer ever is over before it had much of a chance to begin?</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;re&nbsp;panicking.&rdquo; TJ purposely sneaks up on Cyrus and it causes him to jump. TJ slides in next to him on the park bench with an amused chuckle.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always&nbsp;panicking,&rdquo; Cyrus frowns,&nbsp;&ldquo;and even more so now that you&rsquo;ve scared me.&rdquo; Cyrus adds with a playful shove to TJ&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>TJ pretends like it hurt and the two&nbsp;laugh it off.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late, I was packing supplies.&rdquo; TJ pulls his backpack onto his lap and pats it gently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Supplies?&rdquo; Cyrus knits his brows together.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well for starters I made a hard copy of the list,&rdquo;&nbsp;TJ wears an excited smile as he unzips his backpack.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I love hard copies of things.&rdquo; Cyrus gleams.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That way it&rsquo;s rewarding to physically cross something off the list.&rdquo; TJ bops his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;My printer was out of ink so I just wrote them down myself.&rdquo; TJ explains as he hands Cyrus a sheet of paper.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cyrus holds the torn page from one of TJ&rsquo;s notebooks like he was just given the most precious gift. TJ had gone to the effort to write out all ninety-seven things from Cyrus&rsquo; list and even decorated the margin with a few doodles.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Story Summary:</b> When Cyrus finds a playlist on TJ\u2019s desktop full of old love songs, he realizes that TJ has never been a scary basketball guy but rather a huge sap. TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it\u2019s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn\u2019t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they\u2019re always together.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15801564/chapters/37213079\">Ao3 Link</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177417182754/tjs-playlist-chapter-1\">Chapter 1 Link\u00a0</a>| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177784471299/tjs-playlist-chapter-4\">Previous Chapter</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/178153409194/tjs-playlist-chapter-6\">Next Chapter</a> |</b></p><p><b>Words:</b> 3264</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cDo you like TJ? Like, in more than friends?\u201d Buffy asked\nhim.</p><p><i>Anything but that.</i></p><p>\u201cDoes that really matter right now?\u201d Cyrus tried to jump\naround the question. It was a mistake, and he automatically knew it. </p><p>\u201cSo you do?\u201d Buffy almost whispered. Cyrus felt himself turn\nred, and it was an unpleasant feeling that went to his stomach. He really\ndidn\u2019t want to talk about it to anyone at all. It had taken forever for him to\nopen up about Jonah, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to rush himself into\nadmitting something that could turn out to be something as simple as\nappreciation. </p><p>\u201cNo, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus managed to say, \u201cI don\u2019t. But even if I\ndid, that shouldn\u2019t be important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he heard Buffy hesitate, \u201cit\u2019s important to me. It\nchanges a lot.\u201d <i>Change the topic. Change\nthe topic. Change the topic.</i></p><p>\u201cAre we talking right now or tomorrow morning? I don\u2019t want\nto go to bed fighting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fighting,\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice got louder. </p><p>\u201cWell it sounds like we\u2019re starting to,\u201d Cyrus replied, his\ntone matching Buffy\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Buffy stopped for a few seconds, \u201cwhat do you\nwant to talk about?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus plunged right at it and asked her, \u201cDo you not like TJ\nand me hanging out? You guys were cool. He hasn\u2019t changed. If he has, he\u2019s\ngotten a lot better, not worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer my first question,\u201d Buffy brought it up again,\nmaking Cyrus rub his face in frustration. </p><p><i>Why is she suddenly\nthinking about things like this? I don\u2019t even want to think about things like this!</i></p><p>\u201cThere should be absolutely no correlation between why\nyou\u2019ve gone from being on \u2018we\u2019re cool\u2019 terms to \u2018I hate you again.\u2019 Please stop\nasking me that question,\u201d Cyrus groaned. </p><p>\u201cWell if you answered it, I wouldn\u2019t have to ask it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being really rude, Buffy. Maybe we should just talk\ntomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Buffy suddenly shouted. She stayed silent for a\nfraction of a moment and then continued to speak in her regular voice, \u201cLook,\nCyrus. Please just answer that question. It\u2019ll help me sort out my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about <i>my</i>\nfeelings?\u201d Cyrus found himself asking. He knew he sounded like he was on the\nverge of crying. \u201cYou think it\u2019s not upsetting to see you get worked up over\nsomething as small as me helping TJ with math. You\u2019ve done it before. You know\nhe needs help.\u201d Buffy didn\u2019t answer, so Cyrus asked her, \u201cWhat difference will\nit make if I have a crush on TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot, actually,\u201d Buffy replied. \u201cIf you do, it means he\u2019ll\nbe your boyfriend and you\u2019re going to pick him over us most of the time.\u201d Cyrus\nfelt that if he wanted to, he could\u2019ve cried.</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d Cyrus took a deep breath, sitting down at the edge of\nhis bed, \u201cwe never told Andi stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but we were cool with Jonah,\u201d Buffy tried to defend\nher stance. Cyrus knew he had her cornered, though. She didn\u2019t sound so sure of\nherself.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re supposed to be cool with TJ. He rapped for\nyou!\u201d Cyrus reminded her. \u201cYou guys were cool all summer. Nothing should have\nhad changed, Buffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice was the one shaking now, worrying\nCyrus. \u201cIf you like him and he liked you back, I\u2019m so scared he\u2019s going to hurt\nyou. He\u2019s still not an angel, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one,\u201d Cyrus grumbled, in disbelief that he had to say\nthese things, \u201che\u2019s nice to us and especially to me. Two,\u201d Cyrus\u2019 voice was\nraised now as he said, \u201che\u2019s the biggest heterosexual in Shadyside! Do you\nthink I want to hurt myself like that again?\u201d Buffy stayed quiet. Cyrus lowered\nhis voice, looking over to make sure his door was shut, \u201cI\u2019m over Jonah. I\u2019ve\nbeen. But it still hurt seeing him with Andi when I liked him. At the end of\nthe day, I can\u2019t catch feelings for TJ because I\u2019ll hurt myself, and I\u2019ll\nprobably lose the good friendship we have. But let\u2019s face it, Buffy. It\u2019s you I\nhave to worry about losing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop being friends with TJ. He needs me\nright now, and I\u2019m going to be there. I want you to be there, too. I want Jonah\nand Andi to be there. If we could get a little less hair gel on him, maybe he\ncould even be part of the Good Hair Crew,\u201d Cyrus tried to add in some humor. He\nknew it had worked when he heard Buffy chuckle. \u201cPlease, Buffy. If you\u2019re just\nworried that I\u2019m going to, I don\u2019t know, fall in love with TJ and he\u2019s going to\nhurt me, let it go. Please. I\u2019m starting to believe TJ wouldn\u2019t even hurt a\nfly. He has a cat named Macaroni for goodness sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Buffy sighed. \u201cI\u2019m being dramatic.\u201d Cyrus was a\nlittle taken aback. He couldn\u2019t believe Buffy was admitting she was wrong, but\nhe wasn\u2019t going to rub that in.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d Cyrus simply agreed. \u201cI\u2019d never chose my\nfuture boyfriend over you guys anyways. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, there\u2019s something else,\u201d Cyrus added even though he\nfelt exhausted.</p><p>He heard Buffy groan, \u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Jonah and Andi. I\u2019m not\ngoing to meddle into their relationship. They can figure their own stuff out,\nand if they need our opinion, we\u2019ll give it to them occasionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I agree on that one,\u201d Buffy told him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Cyrus knew there was something missing, but he\nwasn\u2019t going to ask Buffy for it. Buffy wasn\u2019t going to give it to him either\nway. \u201cAnyways, just remember that I love you and you can tell me anything, okay?\u201d\nBuffy told him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Cyrus finally smiled. \u201cPlease just be\nhonest next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was being stupid,\u201d Buffy said. That was closest\nCyrus was going to get to a \u2018sorry.\u2019 He knew it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just looking out for me in your own Buffy way,\u201d\nCyrus told her, making her let out a quick laugh.</p><p>\u201cI really am,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnyways, good night, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus said, hanging up. Cyrus fell back\non his bed and looked at his blank ceiling. He didn\u2019t think a phone call could\nbe this draining. He sat back up and looked over at the black leathered journal\nsitting on his bedside drawer. He hadn\u2019t written about TJ in there yet. He knew\nthat when he did, it meant it was permanent. It meant TJ meant a lot more than\nsomething to him.</p><p><i>It means we\u2019re just\nreally good friends </i>Cyrus told himself before standing up and getting the\npolaroid from his cork board. He grabbed a pen and some tape before opening his\njournal.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ was sitting across from Amber on her bed. She was typing\nup an essay while he worked on some of his problems. It took him about ten\nminutes to get through one sometimes. But when he got stuck, he\u2019d just have to\ntap Amber\u2019s ankle, and she\u2019d help him. TJ always told Amber she sucked out all\nthe math abilities from the womb and left him with the random ability to\nremember specific yet mostly irrelevant things. TJ didn\u2019t give a damn when\nPangea stopped being Pangea, yet he knew it was 200 million years ago. It\nsometimes pissed him off.</p><p>TJ\u2019s phone buzzed next to Amber\u2019s on her cluttered desk\nacross the room. It was the only part of her room that still had a lot of\nlittle knick-knacks, mostly things he recognized from their childhood. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t answer it until you\u2019re done with your homework,\u201d\nshe reminded him of their rule. TJ rolled his eyes and went back to his wrinkled\nmath test. He had a feeling it was Cyrus, and it made him wish he could speed\nthrough math. That was the issue about math. It always had a specific answer.\nHe could go knock on a scientist\u2019s door, say <i>fuck you, Pangea broke up 150 million years ago</i>, and it might be\nright if he convinced enough people. But no, math only had one answer. Unless\nit had right two answers, of course. X and Y were the power couple everyone\nhated. Either way, he couldn\u2019t guess on a problem. He couldn\u2019t fake his way out\nof it.</p><p>He continued to work, finding himself doing problems with\nsomewhat more ease. He had finished that day\u2019s homework with Amber\u2019s help, and\nhe was redoing the test. Mrs. Pierson said something about letting him retake\nit if he was interested, and he wasn\u2019t going to let her or Cyrus down. About\ntwenty minutes after the phone had buzzed, he circled the problems he had\nskipped that even Amber couldn\u2019t remember how to solve. There was only a few.\nHe closed the purple highlighter and handed his test to Amber who was finishing\nup her conclusion. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you already have an essay due,\u201d he told her\nas he repeatedly smothered his papers into her laptop until she grabbed them. </p><p>\u201cI just got one of those English teachers that lives off the\nsouls of tired high school kids, no biggie,\u201d she smiled and took the paper. She\nwent over his work for a few minutes while he looked around her room again. It\nwas a lot more empty. </p><p>\u201cYour room looks like you\u2019re ready to move or something,\u201d TJ\ncommented.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just nice to declutter,\u201d she told him, as she placed\nhis test on a notebook and began to write on a sticky note. She fixed his\nmistakes on a sticky note so he would be able to go back and fix things. \u201cHere,\u201d\nshe handed it to him. Almost done. Just that one.\u201d TJ fixed the problem and\nstarted putting his things in his backpack. Amber watching him closely the\nwhole time. \u201cAre you expecting a text from Cyrus?\u201d she asked him, making him\nstop what he was doing. He kept his eyes on his backpack not wanting to turn to\nlook at her. \u201cYou guys look cute together,\u201d she said, making TJ\u2019s face heat up.\n</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d TJ put up his hand to his mouth, causing Amber to\ngiggle.</p><p>\u201cIf you just admit that you like him, it\u2019ll get easier,\u201d she\ntold him gently. \u201cI promise.\u201d TJ put his hand down and rested them on his lap.\nHe had liked two boys before but neither of them were like Cyrus. Nobody was\nlike Cyrus. He had told Amber about both of them, and he had gotten over them fairly\nquickly without getting hurt terribly. Amber was the only one who knew he liked\nguys. It wasn\u2019t that hard for him to hide anyways. Shadyside and all the US\nsociety seemed to have a stereotype for gay people, and he didn\u2019t fit the\nmatch. It made things easier, but he often dug in the future and wondered that\nwhen he was out, if people were going to say he didn\u2019t \u201clook\u201d gay.</p><p>Amber was the one that rejected girls that messaged him. He\nfelt like he\u2019d be too nice and give them the wrong impression. Amber always\nasked him if anyone wondered why the handsome captain of the basketball team\nhad never had a girlfriend. There were definitely girls who wanted to turn the\nschool bully into a \u201ccuddly bunny.\u201d At least that\u2019s what Amber told him.</p><p>\u201cEarth to TJ,\u201d Amber snapped her fingers. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled. </p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Amber smiled at him, \u201cit\u2019s the most obvious thing in\nthe world that you like Cyrus. Even Buffy see\u2019s it.\u201d TJ\u2019s heart skipped.</p><p>He slightly popped his neck as he turned to her, \u201cBuffy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe texted me and asked me about putting up flyers in The\nSpoon, and we kept talking. I might have ended up sending her the photo where\nyou guys were asleep,\u201d she gave him a worried smile, flashing both sets of teeth.\nTJ glared at her and bit his lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was anything bad,\nhonestly. Like maybe Cyrus had already shown her. It\u2019s a cute \u2018guys being dudes\u2019\npics I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything bad,\u201d TJ shook his head. He wasn\u2019t\ngoing to get mad at her for something like that. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Amber gave him a tight-lipped smile, \u201cthat\u2019s when\nBuffy asked me if you liked him. I said I highly doubted it and that you were\njust really cool with Cyrus because he helped you. I switched it on her though.\u201d</p><p>TJ raised an eyebrow at her, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI asked her if Cyrus liked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber!\u201d TJ gasped in horror. Amber let out a laugh and put\nup a pillow in front of her face. \u201cYou can\u2019t just ask Buffy things like that!\nShe\u2019s going to think I really do like him.\u201d TJ let out an inhumane groan that\nmade Amber laugh. </p><p>\u201cWell you do,\u201d Amber lowered the pillow to look at TJ\u2019s\nface. He was freaking out. </p><p>\u201cWell I never admitted it,\u201d TJ crossed his arms like a\nlittle kid, making Amber roll her eyes. </p><p>\u201cCome on, TJ. She just told me she didn\u2019t think so and we\nleft it at that, I swear. I doubt she\u2019ll blow it out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just meet Buffy?\u201d TJ asked her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWe both kind of did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d TJ rubbed his eyes with his hands in circular\nmotion, starting to hope that he had teleported to another world when he looked\nup again. He didn\u2019t. \u201cBuffy was being weird with Cyrus today, and I feel like\nit\u2019s because of that. If she brings <i>that</i>\nup,\u201d TJ frowned, \u201cit\u2019s going to make everything weird. I just know it.\u201d Amber\njust looked at TJ with a grin that made TJ wanted to roll off her bed.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d she chuckled, \u201cyou\u2019re so\u2026 awkward. You weren\u2019t like\nthis when you had a crush on Davis and Marc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I was in elementary school so,\u201d TJ shrugged, giving\nAmber a mournful look. Amber was just sitting there, having the time of her\nlife.</p><p>\u201cI thought Marc was early 6<sup>th</sup> grade?\u201d she raised\na brow, bringing her hand to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d TJ grumbled. </p><p>\u201cWhat makes Cyrus so different that you\u2019re just scared of\nsaying you have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d TJ whispered. He stopped and tried to think of a\nreason. But he really didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared he might like you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Amber. I\u2019d be the happiest person if he liked me back.\nBut I don\u2019t even know if he likes guys. Didn\u2019t he date your friend Iris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to scare him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scare everyone but him off. And Buffy. She asked me if\nwe were vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay yes. Maybe she\u2019ll come put me out of my misery,\u201d TJ moaned.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a drama queen,\u201d Amber rolled her eyes. \u201cJust go\nanswer your crush.\u201d TJ got up from her bed and mad his way towards the desk. He\npicked up his phone and sure enough, he had a text from Cyrys.</p><p>Cyrus: Just got off the phone with Buffy. The convo was a\nlittleee bit more intense than expected but we good now </p><p><b>TJ:</b> good. I\nwas getting worried.</p><p><b>TJ:</b> Was it\nanything I did????</p><p><b>Cyrus:</b> I don\u2019t\nthink she liked you denying ur a vampire</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\nshocker. Can drink blood in peace in this town I swear</p><p><b>Cyrus</b>: do\nyou drink tomato juice?</p><p>TJ smiled at his phone screen, laughing at Cyrus\u2019 comments. \u201cHey,\nTJ,\u201d Amber told him, making him look up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me you have a\ncrush on Cyrus. I think your smile says it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d TJ rolled his eyes, a small smile breaking\nonto his lips.</p><p><b><i>Well, alright, okay, you win</i></b></p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;m in love with you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Baby, what can I do?</i></b></p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;ll do anything you say</i></b></p><p><b><i>It&rsquo;s just got to be that way</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>It was nearly ten o\u2019clock when Cyrus had told TJ goodnight.\nBefore that, Cyrus had told him he was proud of him for doing his math\nhomework, making TJ feel like a giddy dork on the inside. It felt good to have\nsomeone tell him he was doing good. He hadn\u2019t had a conversation with his\nparents in a few days, so Cyrus and Amber were all he had. </p><p>TJ stood up on his bed and reached for the polaroid of him\nand Cyrus on his ceiling. The second he pulled it off, Amber walked into his room,\nscaring him. TJ quickly sat back down and slid the photo under his pillow. He\nshould\u2019ve given up the minute Amber walked in.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Amber grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d TJ furrowed his brows, sitting up and then\nsitting back down on the pillow. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the polaroid of you two together, you\u2019re whipped,\u201d\nshe laughed and took a seat at his desk. TJ saw no point in hiding it anymore,\nso he let out an audible annoyed huff before moving and taking out the photo. It\nwas the one where they were simply smiling but something about it made him want\nto stare at it forever. They just looked like good friends, and TJ felt like he\nwas okay with that.</p><p>\u201cI think he looks good in this photo,\u201d TJ thought out loud,\nimmediately clasping his hand over his mouth as Amber let out an \u2018aww.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cute that you like him,\u201d Amber smiled at him\nas she played with a Rubix cube he had on his desk.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t feel cute,\u201d TJ mumbled. \u201cYou know, knowing\nthat nothing can\u2019t ever happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pessimistic, I swear. As soon as you say \u201cno\u201d to\nsomething, you never want to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t exactly come from the most optimistic family.\nLet\u2019s see. Nana has seen everyone she loves die and hates most of dad\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a million years, old, okay? Plus, was going to see GG\ndie eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad is probably still upset that his heavy metal band never\ngot a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were called the Black Collared Workers, and he had to\nget a day job as a white collared worker. The irony probably hurts him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom didn\u2019t want kids and she got stuck with two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, she could\u2019ve put us up for adoption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Because GG was going to let her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as GG saw I was a girl, he was probably like, \u2018Shit.\nI guess I have a new dancing partner. Oh wait? There\u2019s a boy? Hell yeah. Let\u2019s\ngo fishing.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still danced with GG,\u201d TJ laughed, smiling at a photo of the\nold man on his ceiling. TJ looked like him a lot. It pleased their Nana who was\ntheir GG\u2019s daughter- mostly because she didn\u2019t want her grandkids to look like\nthe Kippen\u2019s.

Like, in more than friends?\u201d Buffy asked\nhim.</p><p><i>Anything but that.</i></p><p>\u201cDoes that really matter right now?\u201d Cyrus tried to jump\naround the question. It was a mistake, and he automatically knew it. </p><p>\u201cSo you do?\u201d Buffy almost whispered. Cyrus felt himself turn\nred, and it was an unpleasant feeling that went to his stomach. He really\ndidn\u2019t want to talk about it to anyone at all. It had taken forever for him to\nopen up about Jonah, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to rush himself into\nadmitting something that could turn out to be something as simple as\nappreciation. </p><p>\u201cNo, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus managed to say, \u201cI don\u2019t. But even if I\ndid, that shouldn\u2019t be important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he heard Buffy hesitate, \u201cit\u2019s important to me. It\nchanges a lot.\u201d <i>Change the topic. Change\nthe topic. Change the topic.</i></p><p>\u201cAre we talking right now or tomorrow morning? I don\u2019t want\nto go to bed fighting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fighting,\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice got louder. </p><p>\u201cWell it sounds like we\u2019re starting to,\u201d Cyrus replied, his\ntone matching Buffy\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Buffy stopped for a few seconds, \u201cwhat do you\nwant to talk about?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus plunged right at it and asked her, \u201cDo you not like TJ\nand me hanging out? You guys were cool. He hasn\u2019t changed. If he has, he\u2019s\ngotten a lot better, not worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer my first question,\u201d Buffy brought it up again,\nmaking Cyrus rub his face in frustration. </p><p><i>Why is she suddenly\nthinking about things like this? I don\u2019t even want to think about things like this!</i></p><p>\u201cThere should be absolutely no correlation between why\nyou\u2019ve gone from being on \u2018we\u2019re cool\u2019 terms to \u2018I hate you again.\u2019 Please stop\nasking me that question,\u201d Cyrus groaned. </p><p>\u201cWell if you answered it, I wouldn\u2019t have to ask it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being really rude, Buffy. Maybe we should just talk\ntomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Buffy suddenly shouted. She stayed silent for a\nfraction of a moment and then continued to speak in her regular voice, \u201cLook,\nCyrus. Please just answer that question. It\u2019ll help me sort out my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about <i>my</i>\nfeelings?\u201d Cyrus found himself asking. He knew he sounded like he was on the\nverge of crying. \u201cYou think it\u2019s not upsetting to see you get worked up over\nsomething as small as me helping TJ with math. You\u2019ve done it before. You know\nhe needs help.\u201d Buffy didn\u2019t answer, so Cyrus asked her, \u201cWhat difference will\nit make if I have a crush on TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot, actually,\u201d Buffy replied. \u201cIf you do, it means he\u2019ll\nbe your boyfriend and you\u2019re going to pick him over us most of the time.\u201d Cyrus\nfelt that if he wanted to, he could\u2019ve cried.</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d Cyrus took a deep breath, sitting down at the edge of\nhis bed, \u201cwe never told Andi stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but we were cool with Jonah,\u201d Buffy tried to defend\nher stance. Cyrus knew he had her cornered, though. She didn\u2019t sound so sure of\nherself.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re supposed to be cool with TJ. He rapped for\nyou!\u201d Cyrus reminded her. \u201cYou guys were cool all summer. Nothing should have\nhad changed, Buffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice was the one shaking now, worrying\nCyrus. \u201cIf you like him and he liked you back, I\u2019m so scared he\u2019s going to hurt\nyou. He\u2019s still not an angel, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one,\u201d Cyrus grumbled, in disbelief that he had to say\nthese things, \u201che\u2019s nice to us and especially to me. Two,\u201d Cyrus\u2019 voice was\nraised now as he said, \u201che\u2019s the biggest heterosexual in Shadyside! Do you\nthink I want to hurt myself like that again?\u201d Buffy stayed quiet. Cyrus lowered\nhis voice, looking over to make sure his door was shut, \u201cI\u2019m over Jonah. I\u2019ve\nbeen. But it still hurt seeing him with Andi when I liked him. At the end of\nthe day, I can\u2019t catch feelings for TJ because I\u2019ll hurt myself, and I\u2019ll\nprobably lose the good friendship we have. But let\u2019s face it, Buffy. It\u2019s you I\nhave to worry about losing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop being friends with TJ. He needs me\nright now, and I\u2019m going to be there. I want you to be there, too. I want Jonah\nand Andi to be there. If we could get a little less hair gel on him, maybe he\ncould even be part of the Good Hair Crew,\u201d Cyrus tried to add in some humor. He\nknew it had worked when he heard Buffy chuckle. \u201cPlease, Buffy. If you\u2019re just\nworried that I\u2019m going to, I don\u2019t know, fall in love with TJ and he\u2019s going to\nhurt me, let it go. Please. I\u2019m starting to believe TJ wouldn\u2019t even hurt a\nfly. He has a cat named Macaroni for goodness sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Buffy sighed. \u201cI\u2019m being dramatic.\u201d Cyrus was a\nlittle taken aback. He couldn\u2019t believe Buffy was admitting she was wrong, but\nhe wasn\u2019t going to rub that in.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d Cyrus simply agreed. \u201cI\u2019d never chose my\nfuture boyfriend over you guys anyways. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, there\u2019s something else,\u201d Cyrus added even though he\nfelt exhausted.</p><p>He heard Buffy groan, \u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Jonah and Andi. I\u2019m not\ngoing to meddle into their relationship. They can figure their own stuff out,\nand if they need our opinion, we\u2019ll give it to them occasionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I agree on that one,\u201d Buffy told him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Cyrus knew there was something missing, but he\nwasn\u2019t going to ask Buffy for it. Buffy wasn\u2019t going to give it to him either\nway. \u201cAnyways, just remember that I love you and you can tell me anything, okay?\u201d\nBuffy told him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Cyrus finally smiled. \u201cPlease just be\nhonest next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was being stupid,\u201d Buffy said. That was closest\nCyrus was going to get to a \u2018sorry.\u2019 He knew it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just looking out for me in your own Buffy way,\u201d\nCyrus told her, making her let out a quick laugh.</p><p>\u201cI really am,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnyways, good night, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus said, hanging up. Cyrus fell back\non his bed and looked at his blank ceiling. He didn\u2019t think a phone call could\nbe this draining. He sat back up and looked over at the black leathered journal\nsitting on his bedside drawer. He hadn\u2019t written about TJ in there yet. He knew\nthat when he did, it meant it was permanent. It meant TJ meant a lot more than\nsomething to him.</p><p><i>It means we\u2019re just\nreally good friends </i>Cyrus told himself before standing up and getting the\npolaroid from his cork board. He grabbed a pen and some tape before opening his\njournal.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ was sitting across from Amber on her bed. She was typing\nup an essay while he worked on some of his problems. It took him about ten\nminutes to get through one sometimes. But when he got stuck, he\u2019d just have to\ntap Amber\u2019s ankle, and she\u2019d help him. TJ always told Amber she sucked out all\nthe math abilities from the womb and left him with the random ability to\nremember specific yet mostly irrelevant things. TJ didn\u2019t give a damn when\nPangea stopped being Pangea, yet he knew it was 200 million years ago. It\nsometimes pissed him off.</p><p>TJ\u2019s phone buzzed next to Amber\u2019s on her cluttered desk\nacross the room. It was the only part of her room that still had a lot of\nlittle knick-knacks, mostly things he recognized from their childhood. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t answer it until you\u2019re done with your homework,\u201d\nshe reminded him of their rule. TJ rolled his eyes and went back to his wrinkled\nmath test. He had a feeling it was Cyrus, and it made him wish he could speed\nthrough math. That was the issue about math. It always had a specific answer.\nHe could go knock on a scientist\u2019s door, say <i>fuck you, Pangea broke up 150 million years ago</i>, and it might be\nright if he convinced enough people. But no, math only had one answer. Unless\nit had right two answers, of course. X and Y were the power couple everyone\nhated. Either way, he couldn\u2019t guess on a problem. He couldn\u2019t fake his way out\nof it.</p><p>He continued to work, finding himself doing problems with\nsomewhat more ease. He had finished that day\u2019s homework with Amber\u2019s help, and\nhe was redoing the test. Mrs. Pierson said something about letting him retake\nit if he was interested, and he wasn\u2019t going to let her or Cyrus down. About\ntwenty minutes after the phone had buzzed, he circled the problems he had\nskipped that even Amber couldn\u2019t remember how to solve. There was only a few.\nHe closed the purple highlighter and handed his test to Amber who was finishing\nup her conclusion. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you already have an essay due,\u201d he told her\nas he repeatedly smothered his papers into her laptop until she grabbed them. </p><p>\u201cI just got one of those English teachers that lives off the\nsouls of tired high school kids, no biggie,\u201d she smiled and took the paper. She\nwent over his work for a few minutes while he looked around her room again. It\nwas a lot more empty. </p><p>\u201cYour room looks like you\u2019re ready to move or something,\u201d TJ\ncommented.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just nice to declutter,\u201d she told him, as she placed\nhis test on a notebook and began to write on a sticky note. She fixed his\nmistakes on a sticky note so he would be able to go back and fix things. \u201cHere,\u201d\nshe handed it to him. Almost done. Just that one.\u201d TJ fixed the problem and\nstarted putting his things in his backpack. Amber watching him closely the\nwhole time. \u201cAre you expecting a text from Cyrus?\u201d she asked him, making him\nstop what he was doing. He kept his eyes on his backpack not wanting to turn to\nlook at her. \u201cYou guys look cute together,\u201d she said, making TJ\u2019s face heat up.\n</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d TJ put up his hand to his mouth, causing Amber to\ngiggle.</p><p>\u201cIf you just admit that you like him, it\u2019ll get easier,\u201d she\ntold him gently. \u201cI promise.\u201d TJ put his hand down and rested them on his lap.\nHe had liked two boys before but neither of them were like Cyrus. Nobody was\nlike Cyrus. He had told Amber about both of them, and he had gotten over them fairly\nquickly without getting hurt terribly. Amber was the only one who knew he liked\nguys. It wasn\u2019t that hard for him to hide anyways. Shadyside and all the US\nsociety seemed to have a stereotype for gay people, and he didn\u2019t fit the\nmatch. It made things easier, but he often dug in the future and wondered that\nwhen he was out, if people were going to say he didn\u2019t \u201clook\u201d gay.</p><p>Amber was the one that rejected girls that messaged him. He\nfelt like he\u2019d be too nice and give them the wrong impression. Amber always\nasked him if anyone wondered why the handsome captain of the basketball team\nhad never had a girlfriend. There were definitely girls who wanted to turn the\nschool bully into a \u201ccuddly bunny.\u201d At least that\u2019s what Amber told him.</p><p>\u201cEarth to TJ,\u201d Amber snapped her fingers. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled. </p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Amber smiled at him, \u201cit\u2019s the most obvious thing in\nthe world that you like Cyrus. Even Buffy see\u2019s it.\u201d TJ\u2019s heart skipped.</p><p>He slightly popped his neck as he turned to her, \u201cBuffy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe texted me and asked me about putting up flyers in The\nSpoon, and we kept talking. I might have ended up sending her the photo where\nyou guys were asleep,\u201d she gave him a worried smile, flashing both sets of teeth.\nTJ glared at her and bit his lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was anything bad,\nhonestly. Like maybe Cyrus had already shown her. It\u2019s a cute \u2018guys being dudes\u2019\npics I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything bad,\u201d TJ shook his head. He wasn\u2019t\ngoing to get mad at her for something like that. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Amber gave him a tight-lipped smile, \u201cthat\u2019s when\nBuffy asked me if you liked him. I said I highly doubted it and that you were\njust really cool with Cyrus because he helped you. I switched it on her though.\u201d</p><p>TJ raised an eyebrow at her, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI asked her if Cyrus liked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber!\u201d TJ gasped in horror. Amber let out a laugh and put\nup a pillow in front of her face. \u201cYou can\u2019t just ask Buffy things like that!\nShe\u2019s going to think I really do like him.\u201d TJ let out an inhumane groan that\nmade Amber laugh. </p><p>\u201cWell you do,\u201d Amber lowered the pillow to look at TJ\u2019s\nface. He was freaking out. </p><p>\u201cWell I never admitted it,\u201d TJ crossed his arms like a\nlittle kid, making Amber roll her eyes. </p><p>\u201cCome on, TJ. She just told me she didn\u2019t think so and we\nleft it at that, I swear. I doubt she\u2019ll blow it out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just meet Buffy?\u201d TJ asked her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWe both kind of did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d TJ rubbed his eyes with his hands in circular\nmotion, starting to hope that he had teleported to another world when he looked\nup again. He didn\u2019t. \u201cBuffy was being weird with Cyrus today, and I feel like\nit\u2019s because of that. If she brings <i>that</i>\nup,\u201d TJ frowned, \u201cit\u2019s going to make everything weird. I just know it.\u201d Amber\njust looked at TJ with a grin that made TJ wanted to roll off her bed.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d she chuckled, \u201cyou\u2019re so\u2026 awkward. You weren\u2019t like\nthis when you had a crush on Davis and Marc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I was in elementary school so,\u201d TJ shrugged, giving\nAmber a mournful look. Amber was just sitting there, having the time of her\nlife.</p><p>\u201cI thought Marc was early 6<sup>th</sup> grade?\u201d she raised\na brow, bringing her hand to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d TJ grumbled. </p><p>\u201cWhat makes Cyrus so different that you\u2019re just scared of\nsaying you have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d TJ whispered. He stopped and tried to think of a\nreason. But he really didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared he might like you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Amber. I\u2019d be the happiest person if he liked me back.\nBut I don\u2019t even know if he likes guys. Didn\u2019t he date your friend Iris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to scare him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scare everyone but him off. And Buffy. She asked me if\nwe were vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay yes. Maybe she\u2019ll come put me out of my misery,\u201d TJ moaned.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a drama queen,\u201d Amber rolled her eyes. \u201cJust go\nanswer your crush.\u201d TJ got up from her bed and mad his way towards the desk. He\npicked up his phone and sure enough, he had a text from Cyrys.</p><p>Cyrus: Just got off the phone with Buffy. The convo was a\nlittleee bit more intense than expected but we good now </p><p><b>TJ:</b> good. I\nwas getting worried.</p><p><b>TJ:</b> Was it\nanything I did????</p><p><b>Cyrus:</b> I don\u2019t\nthink she liked you denying ur a vampire</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\nshocker. Can drink blood in peace in this town I swear</p><p><b>Cyrus</b>: do\nyou drink tomato juice?</p><p>TJ smiled at his phone screen, laughing at Cyrus\u2019 comments. \u201cHey,\nTJ,\u201d Amber told him, making him look up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me you have a\ncrush on Cyrus. I think your smile says it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d TJ rolled his eyes, a small smile breaking\nonto his lips.</p><p><b><i>Well, alright, okay, you win</i></b></p><p><b><i>I\u2019m in love with you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Baby, what can I do?</i></b></p><p><b><i>I\u2019ll do anything you say</i></b></p><p><b><i>It\u2019s just got to be that way</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>It was nearly ten o\u2019clock when Cyrus had told TJ goodnight.\nBefore that, Cyrus had told him he was proud of him for doing his math\nhomework, making TJ feel like a giddy dork on the inside. It felt good to have\nsomeone tell him he was doing good. He hadn\u2019t had a conversation with his\nparents in a few days, so Cyrus and Amber were all he had. </p><p>TJ stood up on his bed and reached for the polaroid of him\nand Cyrus on his ceiling. The second he pulled it off, Amber walked into his room,\nscaring him. TJ quickly sat back down and slid the photo under his pillow. He\nshould\u2019ve given up the minute Amber walked in.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Amber grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d TJ furrowed his brows, sitting up and then\nsitting back down on the pillow. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the polaroid of you two together, you\u2019re whipped,\u201d\nshe laughed and took a seat at his desk. TJ saw no point in hiding it anymore,\nso he let out an audible annoyed huff before moving and taking out the photo. It\nwas the one where they were simply smiling but something about it made him want\nto stare at it forever. They just looked like good friends, and TJ felt like he\nwas okay with that.</p><p>\u201cI think he looks good in this photo,\u201d TJ thought out loud,\nimmediately clasping his hand over his mouth as Amber let out an \u2018aww.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cute that you like him,\u201d Amber smiled at him\nas she played with a Rubix cube he had on his desk.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t feel cute,\u201d TJ mumbled. \u201cYou know, knowing\nthat nothing can\u2019t ever happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pessimistic, I swear. As soon as you say \u201cno\u201d to\nsomething, you never want to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t exactly come from the most optimistic family.\nLet\u2019s see. Nana has seen everyone she loves die and hates most of dad\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a million years, old, okay? Plus, was going to see GG\ndie eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad is probably still upset that his heavy metal band never\ngot a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were called the Black Collared Workers, and he had to\nget a day job as a white collared worker. The irony probably hurts him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom didn\u2019t want kids and she got stuck with two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, she could\u2019ve put us up for adoption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Because GG was going to let her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as GG saw I was a girl, he was probably like, \u2018Shit.\nI guess I have a new dancing partner. Oh wait? There\u2019s a boy? Hell yeah. Let\u2019s\ngo fishing.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still danced with GG,\u201d TJ laughed, smiling at a photo of the\nold man on his ceiling. TJ looked like him a lot. It pleased their Nana who was\ntheir GG\u2019s daughter- mostly because she didn\u2019t want her grandkids to look like\nthe Kippen\u2019s. TJ bit his lip before turning to Amber and asking, \u201cDo you think\nGG would\u2019ve been fine with me being gay?\u201d</p><p>Amber smiled at him, \u201cI think GG would\u2019ve driven us to Pride\nif we asked him. So yeah, TJ. I really do.\u201d TJ gave her a tight-lipped smile\nbefore looking at the photo of Cyrus in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI really like Cyrus, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p><b><i>All that I am askin\u2019</i></b></p><p><b><i>All I want from you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Is just love me like I love you</i></b></p><p><b><i>And it won\u2019t be hard to do</i></b></p><p><b><i>If you\u2019re going to be my man</i></b></p><p><b><i>Sweet baby, take me by the hand</i></b></p><hr><p>For those who asked to be tagged :)\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9hqVewUt-C1_vL4ENG-nWw\">@magicalcowboycalzonemoney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_4tRoSQ5rXO9yEH965AASA\">@the-greatt-perhaps</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOT_OB-C0YwFAA2cBwIMWXg\">@evaeselgreatest</a></p><p>Let me know if you want to be tagged!</p><p>Also I know my updated are really sporadic right now, but I swear I\u2019ll have a set day where I update once a week in about 2 weeks when I start school.

TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it\u2019s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn\u2019t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they\u2019re always together.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15801564/chapters/37213079\">Ao3 Link</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177417182754/tjs-playlist-chapter-1\">Chapter 1 Link\u00a0</a>| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177784471299/tjs-playlist-chapter-4\">Previous Chapter</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/178153409194/tjs-playlist-chapter-6\">Next Chapter</a> |</b></p><p><b>Words:</b> 3264</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDo you like TJ? Like, in more than friends?\u201d Buffy asked\nhim.</p><p><i>Anything but that.</i></p><p>\u201cDoes that really matter right now?\u201d Cyrus tried to jump\naround the question. It was a mistake, and he automatically knew it. </p><p>\u201cSo you do?\u201d Buffy almost whispered. Cyrus felt himself turn\nred, and it was an unpleasant feeling that went to his stomach. He really\ndidn\u2019t want to talk about it to anyone at all. It had taken forever for him to\nopen up about Jonah, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to rush himself into\nadmitting something that could turn out to be something as simple as\nappreciation. </p><p>\u201cNo, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus managed to say, \u201cI don\u2019t. But even if I\ndid, that shouldn\u2019t be important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he heard Buffy hesitate, \u201cit\u2019s important to me. It\nchanges a lot.\u201d <i>Change the topic. Change\nthe topic. Change the topic.</i></p><p>\u201cAre we talking right now or tomorrow morning? I don\u2019t want\nto go to bed fighting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fighting,\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice got louder. </p><p>\u201cWell it sounds like we\u2019re starting to,\u201d Cyrus replied, his\ntone matching Buffy\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Buffy stopped for a few seconds, \u201cwhat do you\nwant to talk about?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus plunged right at it and asked her, \u201cDo you not like TJ\nand me hanging out? You guys were cool. He hasn\u2019t changed. If he has, he\u2019s\ngotten a lot better, not worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer my first question,\u201d Buffy brought it up again,\nmaking Cyrus rub his face in frustration. </p><p><i>Why is she suddenly\nthinking about things like this? I don\u2019t even want to think about things like this!</i></p><p>\u201cThere should be absolutely no correlation between why\nyou\u2019ve gone from being on \u2018we\u2019re cool\u2019 terms to \u2018I hate you again.\u2019 Please stop\nasking me that question,\u201d Cyrus groaned. </p><p>\u201cWell if you answered it, I wouldn\u2019t have to ask it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being really rude, Buffy. Maybe we should just talk\ntomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Buffy suddenly shouted. She stayed silent for a\nfraction of a moment and then continued to speak in her regular voice, \u201cLook,\nCyrus. Please just answer that question. It\u2019ll help me sort out my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about <i>my</i>\nfeelings?\u201d Cyrus found himself asking. He knew he sounded like he was on the\nverge of crying. \u201cYou think it\u2019s not upsetting to see you get worked up over\nsomething as small as me helping TJ with math. You\u2019ve done it before. You know\nhe needs help.\u201d Buffy didn\u2019t answer, so Cyrus asked her, \u201cWhat difference will\nit make if I have a crush on TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot, actually,\u201d Buffy replied. \u201cIf you do, it means he\u2019ll\nbe your boyfriend and you\u2019re going to pick him over us most of the time.\u201d Cyrus\nfelt that if he wanted to, he could\u2019ve cried.</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d Cyrus took a deep breath, sitting down at the edge of\nhis bed, \u201cwe never told Andi stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but we were cool with Jonah,\u201d Buffy tried to defend\nher stance. Cyrus knew he had her cornered, though. She didn\u2019t sound so sure of\nherself.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re supposed to be cool with TJ. He rapped for\nyou!\u201d Cyrus reminded her. \u201cYou guys were cool all summer. Nothing should have\nhad changed, Buffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice was the one shaking now, worrying\nCyrus. \u201cIf you like him and he liked you back, I\u2019m so scared he\u2019s going to hurt\nyou. He\u2019s still not an angel, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one,\u201d Cyrus grumbled, in disbelief that he had to say\nthese things, \u201che\u2019s nice to us and especially to me. Two,\u201d Cyrus\u2019 voice was\nraised now as he said, \u201che\u2019s the biggest heterosexual in Shadyside! Do you\nthink I want to hurt myself like that again?\u201d Buffy stayed quiet. Cyrus lowered\nhis voice, looking over to make sure his door was shut, \u201cI\u2019m over Jonah. I\u2019ve\nbeen. But it still hurt seeing him with Andi when I liked him. At the end of\nthe day, I can\u2019t catch feelings for TJ because I\u2019ll hurt myself, and I\u2019ll\nprobably lose the good friendship we have. But let\u2019s face it, Buffy. It\u2019s you I\nhave to worry about losing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop being friends with TJ. He needs me\nright now, and I\u2019m going to be there. I want you to be there, too. I want Jonah\nand Andi to be there. If we could get a little less hair gel on him, maybe he\ncould even be part of the Good Hair Crew,\u201d Cyrus tried to add in some humor. He\nknew it had worked when he heard Buffy chuckle. \u201cPlease, Buffy. If you\u2019re just\nworried that I\u2019m going to, I don\u2019t know, fall in love with TJ and he\u2019s going to\nhurt me, let it go. Please. I\u2019m starting to believe TJ wouldn\u2019t even hurt a\nfly. He has a cat named Macaroni for goodness sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Buffy sighed. \u201cI\u2019m being dramatic.\u201d Cyrus was a\nlittle taken aback. He couldn\u2019t believe Buffy was admitting she was wrong, but\nhe wasn\u2019t going to rub that in.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d Cyrus simply agreed. \u201cI\u2019d never chose my\nfuture boyfriend over you guys anyways. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, there\u2019s something else,\u201d Cyrus added even though he\nfelt exhausted.</p><p>He heard Buffy groan, \u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Jonah and Andi. I\u2019m not\ngoing to meddle into their relationship. They can figure their own stuff out,\nand if they need our opinion, we\u2019ll give it to them occasionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I agree on that one,\u201d Buffy told him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Cyrus knew there was something missing, but he\nwasn\u2019t going to ask Buffy for it. Buffy wasn\u2019t going to give it to him either\nway. \u201cAnyways, just remember that I love you and you can tell me anything, okay?\u201d\nBuffy told him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Cyrus finally smiled. \u201cPlease just be\nhonest next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was being stupid,\u201d Buffy said. That was closest\nCyrus was going to get to a \u2018sorry.\u2019 He knew it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just looking out for me in your own Buffy way,\u201d\nCyrus told her, making her let out a quick laugh.</p><p>\u201cI really am,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnyways, good night, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus said, hanging up. Cyrus fell back\non his bed and looked at his blank ceiling. He didn\u2019t think a phone call could\nbe this draining. He sat back up and looked over at the black leathered journal\nsitting on his bedside drawer. He hadn\u2019t written about TJ in there yet. He knew\nthat when he did, it meant it was permanent. It meant TJ meant a lot more than\nsomething to him.</p><p><i>It means we\u2019re just\nreally good friends </i>Cyrus told himself before standing up and getting the\npolaroid from his cork board. He grabbed a pen and some tape before opening his\njournal.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ was sitting across from Amber on her bed. She was typing\nup an essay while he worked on some of his problems. It took him about ten\nminutes to get through one sometimes. But when he got stuck, he\u2019d just have to\ntap Amber\u2019s ankle, and she\u2019d help him. TJ always told Amber she sucked out all\nthe math abilities from the womb and left him with the random ability to\nremember specific yet mostly irrelevant things. TJ didn\u2019t give a damn when\nPangea stopped being Pangea, yet he knew it was 200 million years ago. It\nsometimes pissed him off.</p><p>TJ\u2019s phone buzzed next to Amber\u2019s on her cluttered desk\nacross the room. It was the only part of her room that still had a lot of\nlittle knick-knacks, mostly things he recognized from their childhood. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t answer it until you\u2019re done with your homework,\u201d\nshe reminded him of their rule. TJ rolled his eyes and went back to his wrinkled\nmath test. He had a feeling it was Cyrus, and it made him wish he could speed\nthrough math. That was the issue about math. It always had a specific answer.\nHe could go knock on a scientist\u2019s door, say <i>fuck you, Pangea broke up 150 million years ago</i>, and it might be\nright if he convinced enough people. But no, math only had one answer. Unless\nit had right two answers, of course. X and Y were the power couple everyone\nhated. Either way, he couldn\u2019t guess on a problem. He couldn\u2019t fake his way out\nof it.</p><p>He continued to work, finding himself doing problems with\nsomewhat more ease. He had finished that day\u2019s homework with Amber\u2019s help, and\nhe was redoing the test. Mrs. Pierson said something about letting him retake\nit if he was interested, and he wasn\u2019t going to let her or Cyrus down. About\ntwenty minutes after the phone had buzzed, he circled the problems he had\nskipped that even Amber couldn\u2019t remember how to solve. There was only a few.\nHe closed the purple highlighter and handed his test to Amber who was finishing\nup her conclusion. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you already have an essay due,\u201d he told her\nas he repeatedly smothered his papers into her laptop until she grabbed them. </p><p>\u201cI just got one of those English teachers that lives off the\nsouls of tired high school kids, no biggie,\u201d she smiled and took the paper. She\nwent over his work for a few minutes while he looked around her room again. It\nwas a lot more empty. </p><p>\u201cYour room looks like you\u2019re ready to move or something,\u201d TJ\ncommented.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just nice to declutter,\u201d she told him, as she placed\nhis test on a notebook and began to write on a sticky note. She fixed his\nmistakes on a sticky note so he would be able to go back and fix things. \u201cHere,\u201d\nshe handed it to him. Almost done. Just that one.\u201d TJ fixed the problem and\nstarted putting his things in his backpack. Amber watching him closely the\nwhole time. \u201cAre you expecting a text from Cyrus?\u201d she asked him, making him\nstop what he was doing. He kept his eyes on his backpack not wanting to turn to\nlook at her. \u201cYou guys look cute together,\u201d she said, making TJ\u2019s face heat up.\n</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d TJ put up his hand to his mouth, causing Amber to\ngiggle.</p><p>\u201cIf you just admit that you like him, it\u2019ll get easier,\u201d she\ntold him gently. \u201cI promise.\u201d TJ put his hand down and rested them on his lap.\nHe had liked two boys before but neither of them were like Cyrus. Nobody was\nlike Cyrus. He had told Amber about both of them, and he had gotten over them fairly\nquickly without getting hurt terribly. Amber was the only one who knew he liked\nguys. It wasn\u2019t that hard for him to hide anyways. Shadyside and all the US\nsociety seemed to have a stereotype for gay people, and he didn\u2019t fit the\nmatch. It made things easier, but he often dug in the future and wondered that\nwhen he was out, if people were going to say he didn\u2019t \u201clook\u201d gay.</p><p>Amber was the one that rejected girls that messaged him. He\nfelt like he\u2019d be too nice and give them the wrong impression. Amber always\nasked him if anyone wondered why the handsome captain of the basketball team\nhad never had a girlfriend. There were definitely girls who wanted to turn the\nschool bully into a \u201ccuddly bunny.\u201d At least that\u2019s what Amber told him.</p><p>\u201cEarth to TJ,\u201d Amber snapped her fingers. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled. </p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Amber smiled at him, \u201cit\u2019s the most obvious thing in\nthe world that you like Cyrus. Even Buffy see\u2019s it.\u201d TJ\u2019s heart skipped.</p><p>He slightly popped his neck as he turned to her, \u201cBuffy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe texted me and asked me about putting up flyers in The\nSpoon, and we kept talking. I might have ended up sending her the photo where\nyou guys were asleep,\u201d she gave him a worried smile, flashing both sets of teeth.\nTJ glared at her and bit his lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was anything bad,\nhonestly. Like maybe Cyrus had already shown her. It\u2019s a cute \u2018guys being dudes\u2019\npics I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything bad,\u201d TJ shook his head. He wasn\u2019t\ngoing to get mad at her for something like that. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Amber gave him a tight-lipped smile, \u201cthat\u2019s when\nBuffy asked me if you liked him. I said I highly doubted it and that you were\njust really cool with Cyrus because he helped you. I switched it on her though.\u201d</p><p>TJ raised an eyebrow at her, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI asked her if Cyrus liked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber!\u201d TJ gasped in horror. Amber let out a laugh and put\nup a pillow in front of her face. \u201cYou can\u2019t just ask Buffy things like that!\nShe\u2019s going to think I really do like him.\u201d TJ let out an inhumane groan that\nmade Amber laugh. </p><p>\u201cWell you do,\u201d Amber lowered the pillow to look at TJ\u2019s\nface. He was freaking out. </p><p>\u201cWell I never admitted it,\u201d TJ crossed his arms like a\nlittle kid, making Amber roll her eyes. </p><p>\u201cCome on, TJ. She just told me she didn\u2019t think so and we\nleft it at that, I swear. I doubt she\u2019ll blow it out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just meet Buffy?\u201d TJ asked her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWe both kind of did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d TJ rubbed his eyes with his hands in circular\nmotion, starting to hope that he had teleported to another world when he looked\nup again. He didn\u2019t. \u201cBuffy was being weird with Cyrus today, and I feel like\nit\u2019s because of that. If she brings <i>that</i>\nup,\u201d TJ frowned, \u201cit\u2019s going to make everything weird. I just know it.\u201d Amber\njust looked at TJ with a grin that made TJ wanted to roll off her bed.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d she chuckled, \u201cyou\u2019re so\u2026 awkward. You weren\u2019t like\nthis when you had a crush on Davis and Marc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I was in elementary school so,\u201d TJ shrugged, giving\nAmber a mournful look. Amber was just sitting there, having the time of her\nlife.</p><p>\u201cI thought Marc was early 6<sup>th</sup> grade?\u201d she raised\na brow, bringing her hand to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d TJ grumbled. </p><p>\u201cWhat makes Cyrus so different that you\u2019re just scared of\nsaying you have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d TJ whispered. He stopped and tried to think of a\nreason. But he really didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared he might like you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Amber. I\u2019d be the happiest person if he liked me back.\nBut I don\u2019t even know if he likes guys. Didn\u2019t he date your friend Iris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to scare him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scare everyone but him off. And Buffy. She asked me if\nwe were vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay yes. Maybe she\u2019ll come put me out of my misery,\u201d TJ moaned.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a drama queen,\u201d Amber rolled her eyes. \u201cJust go\nanswer your crush.\u201d TJ got up from her bed and mad his way towards the desk. He\npicked up his phone and sure enough, he had a text from Cyrys.</p><p>Cyrus: Just got off the phone with Buffy. The convo was a\nlittleee bit more intense than expected but we good now </p><p><b>TJ:</b> good. I\nwas getting worried.</p><p><b>TJ:</b> Was it\nanything I did????</p><p><b>Cyrus:</b> I don\u2019t\nthink she liked you denying ur a vampire</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\nshocker. Can drink blood in peace in this town I swear</p><p><b>Cyrus</b>: do\nyou drink tomato juice?</p><p>TJ smiled at his phone screen, laughing at Cyrus\u2019 comments. \u201cHey,\nTJ,\u201d Amber told him, making him look up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me you have a\ncrush on Cyrus. I think your smile says it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d TJ rolled his eyes, a small smile breaking\nonto his lips.</p><p><b><i>Well, alright, okay, you win</i></b></p><p><b><i>I\u2019m in love with you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Baby, what can I do?</i></b></p><p><b><i>I\u2019ll do anything you say</i></b></p><p><b><i>It\u2019s just got to be that way</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>It was nearly ten o\u2019clock when Cyrus had told TJ goodnight.\nBefore that, Cyrus had told him he was proud of him for doing his math\nhomework, making TJ feel like a giddy dork on the inside. It felt good to have\nsomeone tell him he was doing good. He hadn\u2019t had a conversation with his\nparents in a few days, so Cyrus and Amber were all he had. </p><p>TJ stood up on his bed and reached for the polaroid of him\nand Cyrus on his ceiling. The second he pulled it off, Amber walked into his room,\nscaring him. TJ quickly sat back down and slid the photo under his pillow. He\nshould\u2019ve given up the minute Amber walked in.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Amber grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d TJ furrowed his brows, sitting up and then\nsitting back down on the pillow. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the polaroid of you two together, you\u2019re whipped,\u201d\nshe laughed and took a seat at his desk. TJ saw no point in hiding it anymore,\nso he let out an audible annoyed huff before moving and taking out the photo. It\nwas the one where they were simply smiling but something about it made him want\nto stare at it forever. They just looked like good friends, and TJ felt like he\nwas okay with that.</p><p>\u201cI think he looks good in this photo,\u201d TJ thought out loud,\nimmediately clasping his hand over his mouth as Amber let out an \u2018aww.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cute that you like him,\u201d Amber smiled at him\nas she played with a Rubix cube he had on his desk.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t feel cute,\u201d TJ mumbled. \u201cYou know, knowing\nthat nothing can\u2019t ever happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pessimistic, I swear. As soon as you say \u201cno\u201d to\nsomething, you never want to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t exactly come from the most optimistic family.\nLet\u2019s see. Nana has seen everyone she loves die and hates most of dad\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a million years, old, okay? Plus, was going to see GG\ndie eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad is probably still upset that his heavy metal band never\ngot a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were called the Black Collared Workers, and he had to\nget a day job as a white collared worker. The irony probably hurts him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom didn\u2019t want kids and she got stuck with two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, she could\u2019ve put us up for adoption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Because GG was going to let her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as GG saw I was a girl, he was probably like, \u2018Shit.\nI guess I have a new dancing partner. Oh wait? There\u2019s a boy? Hell yeah. Let\u2019s\ngo fishing.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still danced with GG,\u201d TJ laughed, smiling at a photo of the\nold man on his ceiling. TJ looked like him a lot. It pleased their Nana who was\ntheir GG\u2019s daughter- mostly because she didn\u2019t want her grandkids to look like\nthe Kippen\u2019s. TJ bit his lip before turning to Amber and asking, \u201cDo you think\nGG would\u2019ve been fine with me being gay?\u201d</p><p>Amber smiled at him, \u201cI think GG would\u2019ve driven us to Pride\nif we asked him. So yeah, TJ. I really do.\u201d TJ gave her a tight-lipped smile\nbefore looking at the photo of Cyrus in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI really like Cyrus, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p><b><i>All that I am askin\u2019</i></b></p><p><b><i>All I want from you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Is just love me like I love you</i></b></p><p><b><i>And it won\u2019t be hard to do</i></b></p><p><b><i>If you\u2019re going to be my man</i></b></p><p><b><i>Sweet baby, take me by the hand</i></b></p><hr><p>For those who asked to be tagged :)\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9hqVewUt-C1_vL4ENG-nWw\">@magicalcowboycalzonemoney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_4tRoSQ5rXO9yEH965AASA\">@the-greatt-perhaps</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOT_OB-C0YwFAA2cBwIMWXg\">@evaeselgreatest</a></p><p>Let me know if you want to be tagged!</p><p>Also I know my updated are really sporadic right now, but I swear I\u2019ll have a set day where I update once a week in about 2 weeks when I start school.

                "content": "<p><b>Story Summary:</b> When Cyrus finds a playlist on TJ&rsquo;s desktop full of old love songs, he realizes that TJ has never been a scary basketball guy but rather a huge sap. TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it&rsquo;s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they&rsquo;re always together.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15801564/chapters/37213079\">Ao3 Link</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177417182754/tjs-playlist-chapter-1\">Chapter 1 Link&nbsp;</a>| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177784471299/tjs-playlist-chapter-4\">Previous Chapter</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/178153409194/tjs-playlist-chapter-6\">Next Chapter</a> |</b></p><p><b>Words:</b> 3264</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like TJ? Like, in more than friends?&rdquo; Buffy asked\nhim.</p><p><i>Anything but that.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Does that really matter right now?&rdquo; Cyrus tried to jump\naround the question. It was a mistake, and he automatically knew it. </p><p>&ldquo;So you do?&rdquo; Buffy almost whispered. Cyrus felt himself turn\nred, and it was an unpleasant feeling that went to his stomach. He really\ndidn&rsquo;t want to talk about it to anyone at all. It had taken forever for him to\nopen up about Jonah, and he certainly didn&rsquo;t want to rush himself into\nadmitting something that could turn out to be something as simple as\nappreciation. </p><p>&ldquo;No, Buffy,&rdquo; Cyrus managed to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. But even if I\ndid, that shouldn&rsquo;t be important.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he heard Buffy hesitate, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s important to me. It\nchanges a lot.&rdquo; <i>Change the topic. Change\nthe topic. Change the topic.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Are we talking right now or tomorrow morning? I don&rsquo;t want\nto go to bed fighting with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not fighting,&rdquo; Buffy&rsquo;s voice got louder. </p><p>&ldquo;Well it sounds like we&rsquo;re starting to,&rdquo; Cyrus replied, his\ntone matching Buffy&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Buffy stopped for a few seconds, &ldquo;what do you\nwant to talk about?&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus plunged right at it and asked her, &ldquo;Do you not like TJ\nand me hanging out? You guys were cool. He hasn&rsquo;t changed. If he has, he&rsquo;s\ngotten a lot better, not worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Answer my first question,&rdquo; Buffy brought it up again,\nmaking Cyrus rub his face in frustration. </p><p><i>Why is she suddenly\nthinking about things like this? I don&rsquo;t even want to think about things like this!</i></p><p>&ldquo;There should be absolutely no correlation between why\nyou&rsquo;ve gone from being on &lsquo;we&rsquo;re cool&rsquo; terms to &lsquo;I hate you again.&rsquo; Please stop\nasking me that question,&rdquo; Cyrus groaned. </p><p>&ldquo;Well if you answered it, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to ask it again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being really rude, Buffy. Maybe we should just talk\ntomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Buffy suddenly shouted. She stayed silent for a\nfraction of a moment and then continued to speak in her regular voice, &ldquo;Look,\nCyrus. Please just answer that question. It&rsquo;ll help me sort out my feelings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about <i>my</i>\nfeelings?&rdquo; Cyrus found himself asking. He knew he sounded like he was on the\nverge of crying. &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s not upsetting to see you get worked up over\nsomething as small as me helping TJ with math. You&rsquo;ve done it before. You know\nhe needs help.&rdquo; Buffy didn&rsquo;t answer, so Cyrus asked her, &ldquo;What difference will\nit make if I have a crush on TJ?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A lot, actually,&rdquo; Buffy replied. &ldquo;If you do, it means he&rsquo;ll\nbe your boyfriend and you&rsquo;re going to pick him over us most of the time.&rdquo; Cyrus\nfelt that if he wanted to, he could&rsquo;ve cried.</p><p>&ldquo;We,&rdquo; Cyrus took a deep breath, sitting down at the edge of\nhis bed, &ldquo;we never told Andi stuff like this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but we were cool with Jonah,&rdquo; Buffy tried to defend\nher stance. Cyrus knew he had her cornered, though. She didn&rsquo;t sound so sure of\nherself.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re supposed to be cool with TJ. He rapped for\nyou!&rdquo; Cyrus reminded her. &ldquo;You guys were cool all summer. Nothing should have\nhad changed, Buffy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; Buffy&rsquo;s voice was the one shaking now, worrying\nCyrus. &ldquo;If you like him and he liked you back, I&rsquo;m so scared he&rsquo;s going to hurt\nyou. He&rsquo;s still not an angel, you know that, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, one,&rdquo; Cyrus grumbled, in disbelief that he had to say\nthese things, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s nice to us and especially to me. Two,&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo; voice was\nraised now as he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the biggest heterosexual in Shadyside! Do you\nthink I want to hurt myself like that again?&rdquo; Buffy stayed quiet. Cyrus lowered\nhis voice, looking over to make sure his door was shut, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m over Jonah. I&rsquo;ve\nbeen. But it still hurt seeing him with Andi when I liked him. At the end of\nthe day, I can&rsquo;t catch feelings for TJ because I&rsquo;ll hurt myself, and I&rsquo;ll\nprobably lose the good friendship we have. But let&rsquo;s face it, Buffy. It&rsquo;s you I\nhave to worry about losing right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stop being friends with TJ. He needs me\nright now, and I&rsquo;m going to be there. I want you to be there, too. I want Jonah\nand Andi to be there. If we could get a little less hair gel on him, maybe he\ncould even be part of the Good Hair Crew,&rdquo; Cyrus tried to add in some humor. He\nknew it had worked when he heard Buffy chuckle. &ldquo;Please, Buffy. If you&rsquo;re just\nworried that I&rsquo;m going to, I don&rsquo;t know, fall in love with TJ and he&rsquo;s going to\nhurt me, let it go. Please. I&rsquo;m starting to believe TJ wouldn&rsquo;t even hurt a\nfly. He has a cat named Macaroni for goodness sake!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Buffy sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being dramatic.&rdquo; Cyrus was a\nlittle taken aback. He couldn&rsquo;t believe Buffy was admitting she was wrong, but\nhe wasn&rsquo;t going to rub that in.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you are,&rdquo; Cyrus simply agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never chose my\nfuture boyfriend over you guys anyways. You know that, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, there&rsquo;s something else,&rdquo; Cyrus added even though he\nfelt exhausted.</p><p>He heard Buffy groan, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Jonah and Andi. I&rsquo;m not\ngoing to meddle into their relationship. They can figure their own stuff out,\nand if they need our opinion, we&rsquo;ll give it to them occasionally.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I agree on that one,&rdquo; Buffy told him.</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Cyrus knew there was something missing, but he\nwasn&rsquo;t going to ask Buffy for it. Buffy wasn&rsquo;t going to give it to him either\nway. &ldquo;Anyways, just remember that I love you and you can tell me anything, okay?&rdquo;\nBuffy told him.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too,&rdquo; Cyrus finally smiled. &ldquo;Please just be\nhonest next time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I was being stupid,&rdquo; Buffy said. That was closest\nCyrus was going to get to a &lsquo;sorry.&rsquo; He knew it. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just looking out for me in your own Buffy way,&rdquo;\nCyrus told her, making her let out a quick laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;I really am,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Anyways, good night, Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Buffy,&rdquo; Cyrus said, hanging up. Cyrus fell back\non his bed and looked at his blank ceiling. He didn&rsquo;t think a phone call could\nbe this draining. He sat back up and looked over at the black leathered journal\nsitting on his bedside drawer. He hadn&rsquo;t written about TJ in there yet. He knew\nthat when he did, it meant it was permanent. It meant TJ meant a lot more than\nsomething to him.</p><p><i>It means we&rsquo;re just\nreally good friends </i>Cyrus told himself before standing up and getting the\npolaroid from his cork board. He grabbed a pen and some tape before opening his\njournal.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ was sitting across from Amber on her bed. She was typing\nup an essay while he worked on some of his problems. It took him about ten\nminutes to get through one sometimes. But when he got stuck, he&rsquo;d just have to\ntap Amber&rsquo;s ankle, and she&rsquo;d help him. TJ always told Amber she sucked out all\nthe math abilities from the womb and left him with the random ability to\nremember specific yet mostly irrelevant things. TJ didn&rsquo;t give a damn when\nPangea stopped being Pangea, yet he knew it was 200 million years ago. It\nsometimes pissed him off.</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s phone buzzed next to Amber&rsquo;s on her cluttered desk\nacross the room. It was the only part of her room that still had a lot of\nlittle knick-knacks, mostly things he recognized from their childhood. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t answer it until you&rsquo;re done with your homework,&rdquo;\nshe reminded him of their rule. TJ rolled his eyes and went back to his wrinkled\nmath test. He had a feeling it was Cyrus, and it made him wish he could speed\nthrough math. That was the issue about math. It always had a specific answer.\nHe could go knock on a scientist&rsquo;s door, say <i>fuck you, Pangea broke up 150 million years ago</i>, and it might be\nright if he convinced enough people. But no, math only had one answer. Unless\nit had right two answers, of course. X and Y were the power couple everyone\nhated. Either way, he couldn&rsquo;t guess on a problem. He couldn&rsquo;t fake his way out\nof it.</p><p>He continued to work, finding himself doing problems with\nsomewhat more ease. He had finished that day&rsquo;s homework with Amber&rsquo;s help, and\nhe was redoing the test. Mrs. Pierson said something about letting him retake\nit if he was interested, and he wasn&rsquo;t going to let her or Cyrus down. About\ntwenty minutes after the phone had buzzed, he circled the problems he had\nskipped that even Amber couldn&rsquo;t remember how to solve. There was only a few.\nHe closed the purple highlighter and handed his test to Amber who was finishing\nup her conclusion. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you already have an essay due,&rdquo; he told her\nas he repeatedly smothered his papers into her laptop until she grabbed them. </p><p>&ldquo;I just got one of those English teachers that lives off the\nsouls of tired high school kids, no biggie,&rdquo; she smiled and took the paper. She\nwent over his work for a few minutes while he looked around her room again. It\nwas a lot more empty. </p><p>&ldquo;Your room looks like you&rsquo;re ready to move or something,&rdquo; TJ\ncommented.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just nice to declutter,&rdquo; she told him, as she placed\nhis test on a notebook and began to write on a sticky note. She fixed his\nmistakes on a sticky note so he would be able to go back and fix things. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo;\nshe handed it to him. Almost done. Just that one.&rdquo; TJ fixed the problem and\nstarted putting his things in his backpack. Amber watching him closely the\nwhole time. &ldquo;Are you expecting a text from Cyrus?&rdquo; she asked him, making him\nstop what he was doing. He kept his eyes on his backpack not wanting to turn to\nlook at her. &ldquo;You guys look cute together,&rdquo; she said, making TJ&rsquo;s face heat up.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I just,&rdquo; TJ put up his hand to his mouth, causing Amber to\ngiggle.</p><p>&ldquo;If you just admit that you like him, it&rsquo;ll get easier,&rdquo; she\ntold him gently. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; TJ put his hand down and rested them on his lap.\nHe had liked two boys before but neither of them were like Cyrus. Nobody was\nlike Cyrus. He had told Amber about both of them, and he had gotten over them fairly\nquickly without getting hurt terribly. Amber was the only one who knew he liked\nguys. It wasn&rsquo;t that hard for him to hide anyways. Shadyside and all the US\nsociety seemed to have a stereotype for gay people, and he didn&rsquo;t fit the\nmatch. It made things easier, but he often dug in the future and wondered that\nwhen he was out, if people were going to say he didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;look&rdquo; gay.</p><p>Amber was the one that rejected girls that messaged him. He\nfelt like he&rsquo;d be too nice and give them the wrong impression. Amber always\nasked him if anyone wondered why the handsome captain of the basketball team\nhad never had a girlfriend. There were definitely girls who wanted to turn the\nschool bully into a &ldquo;cuddly bunny.&rdquo; At least that&rsquo;s what Amber told him.</p><p>&ldquo;Earth to TJ,&rdquo; Amber snapped her fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he mumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Amber smiled at him, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the most obvious thing in\nthe world that you like Cyrus. Even Buffy see&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s heart skipped.</p><p>He slightly popped his neck as he turned to her, &ldquo;Buffy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She texted me and asked me about putting up flyers in The\nSpoon, and we kept talking. I might have ended up sending her the photo where\nyou guys were asleep,&rdquo; she gave him a worried smile, flashing both sets of teeth.\nTJ glared at her and bit his lip. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was anything bad,\nhonestly. Like maybe Cyrus had already shown her. It&rsquo;s a cute &lsquo;guys being dudes&rsquo;\npics I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything bad,&rdquo; TJ shook his head. He wasn&rsquo;t\ngoing to get mad at her for something like that. </p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Amber gave him a tight-lipped smile, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s when\nBuffy asked me if you liked him. I said I highly doubted it and that you were\njust really cool with Cyrus because he helped you. I switched it on her though.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ raised an eyebrow at her, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I asked her if Cyrus liked you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Amber!&rdquo; TJ gasped in horror. Amber let out a laugh and put\nup a pillow in front of her face. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just ask Buffy things like that!\nShe&rsquo;s going to think I really do like him.&rdquo; TJ let out an inhumane groan that\nmade Amber laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Well you do,&rdquo; Amber lowered the pillow to look at TJ&rsquo;s\nface. He was freaking out. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I never admitted it,&rdquo; TJ crossed his arms like a\nlittle kid, making Amber roll her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on, TJ. She just told me she didn&rsquo;t think so and we\nleft it at that, I swear. I doubt she&rsquo;ll blow it out of proportion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you just meet Buffy?&rdquo; TJ asked her in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;We both kind of did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; TJ rubbed his eyes with his hands in circular\nmotion, starting to hope that he had teleported to another world when he looked\nup again. He didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Buffy was being weird with Cyrus today, and I feel like\nit&rsquo;s because of that. If she brings <i>that</i>\nup,&rdquo; TJ frowned, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to make everything weird. I just know it.&rdquo; Amber\njust looked at TJ with a grin that made TJ wanted to roll off her bed.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; she chuckled, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re so&hellip; awkward. You weren&rsquo;t like\nthis when you had a crush on Davis and Marc.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I was in elementary school so,&rdquo; TJ shrugged, giving\nAmber a mournful look. Amber was just sitting there, having the time of her\nlife.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought Marc was early 6<sup>th</sup> grade?&rdquo; she raised\na brow, bringing her hand to her cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Same thing,&rdquo; TJ grumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;What makes Cyrus so different that you&rsquo;re just scared of\nsaying you have a crush on him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; TJ whispered. He stopped and tried to think of a\nreason. But he really didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you scared he might like you back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God, Amber. I&rsquo;d be the happiest person if he liked me back.\nBut I don&rsquo;t even know if he likes guys. Didn&rsquo;t he date your friend Iris?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to scare him off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You scare everyone but him off. And Buffy. She asked me if\nwe were vampires.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say yes. Maybe she&rsquo;ll come put me out of my misery,&rdquo; TJ moaned.\n</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a drama queen,&rdquo; Amber rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Just go\nanswer your crush.&rdquo; TJ got up from her bed and mad his way towards the desk. He\npicked up his phone and sure enough, he had a text from Cyrys.</p><p>Cyrus: Just got off the phone with Buffy. The convo was a\nlittleee bit more intense than expected but we good now </p><p><b>TJ:</b> good. I\nwas getting worried.</p><p><b>TJ:</b> Was it\nanything I did????</p><p><b>Cyrus:</b> I don&rsquo;t\nthink she liked you denying ur a vampire</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\nshocker. Can drink blood in peace in this town I swear</p><p><b>Cyrus</b>: do\nyou drink tomato juice?</p><p>TJ smiled at his phone screen, laughing at Cyrus&rsquo; comments. &ldquo;Hey,\nTJ,&rdquo; Amber told him, making him look up. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me you have a\ncrush on Cyrus. I think your smile says it all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up,&rdquo; TJ rolled his eyes, a small smile breaking\nonto his lips.</p><p><b><i>Well, alright, okay, you win</i></b></p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;m in love with you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Baby, what can I do?</i></b></p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;ll do anything you say</i></b></p><p><b><i>It&rsquo;s just got to be that way</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when Cyrus had told TJ goodnight.\nBefore that, Cyrus had told him he was proud of him for doing his math\nhomework, making TJ feel like a giddy dork on the inside. It felt good to have\nsomeone tell him he was doing good. He hadn&rsquo;t had a conversation with his\nparents in a few days, so Cyrus and Amber were all he had. </p><p>TJ stood up on his bed and reached for the polaroid of him\nand Cyrus on his ceiling. The second he pulled it off, Amber walked into his room,\nscaring him. TJ quickly sat back down and slid the photo under his pillow. He\nshould&rsquo;ve given up the minute Amber walked in.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Amber grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; TJ furrowed his brows, sitting up and then\nsitting back down on the pillow. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s the polaroid of you two together, you&rsquo;re whipped,&rdquo;\nshe laughed and took a seat at his desk. TJ saw no point in hiding it anymore,\nso he let out an audible annoyed huff before moving and taking out the photo. It\nwas the one where they were simply smiling but something about it made him want\nto stare at it forever. They just looked like good friends, and TJ felt like he\nwas okay with that.</p><p>&ldquo;I think he looks good in this photo,&rdquo; TJ thought out loud,\nimmediately clasping his hand over his mouth as Amber let out an &lsquo;aww.&rsquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s cute that you like him,&rdquo; Amber smiled at him\nas she played with a Rubix cube he had on his desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t feel cute,&rdquo; TJ mumbled. &ldquo;You know, knowing\nthat nothing can&rsquo;t ever happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so pessimistic, I swear. As soon as you say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to\nsomething, you never want to change your mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t exactly come from the most optimistic family.\nLet&rsquo;s see. Nana has seen everyone she loves die and hates most of dad&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a million years, old, okay? Plus, was going to see GG\ndie eventually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad is probably still upset that his heavy metal band never\ngot a break.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They were called the Black Collared Workers, and he had to\nget a day job as a white collared worker. The irony probably hurts him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mom didn&rsquo;t want kids and she got stuck with two of us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Technically, she could&rsquo;ve put us up for adoption.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah. Because GG was going to let her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as GG saw I was a girl, he was probably like, &lsquo;Shit.\nI guess I have a new dancing partner. Oh wait? There&rsquo;s a boy? Hell yeah. Let&rsquo;s\ngo fishing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I still danced with GG,&rdquo; TJ laughed, smiling at a photo of the\nold man on his ceiling. TJ looked like him a lot. It pleased their Nana who was\ntheir GG&rsquo;s daughter- mostly because she didn&rsquo;t want her grandkids to look like\nthe Kippen&rsquo;s. TJ bit his lip before turning to Amber and asking, &ldquo;Do you think\nGG would&rsquo;ve been fine with me being gay?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber smiled at him, &ldquo;I think GG would&rsquo;ve driven us to Pride\nif we asked him. So yeah, TJ. I really do.&rdquo; TJ gave her a tight-lipped smile\nbefore looking at the photo of Cyrus in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I really like Cyrus, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p><b><i>All that I am askin&rsquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>All I want from you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Is just love me like I love you</i></b></p><p><b><i>And it won&rsquo;t be hard to do</i></b></p><p><b><i>If you&rsquo;re going to be my man</i></b></p><p><b><i>Sweet baby, take me by the hand</i></b></p><hr /><p>For those who asked to be tagged :)&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9hqVewUt-C1_vL4ENG-nWw\">@magicalcowboycalzonemoney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_4tRoSQ5rXO9yEH965AASA\">@the-greatt-perhaps</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOT_OB-C0YwFAA2cBwIMWXg\">@evaeselgreatest</a></p><p>Let me know if you want to be tagged!</p><p>Also I know my updated are really sporadic right now, but I swear I&rsquo;ll have a set day where I update once a week in about 2 weeks when I start school.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Story Summary:</b> When Cyrus finds a playlist on TJ&rsquo;s desktop full of old love songs, he realizes that TJ has never been a scary basketball guy but rather a huge sap. TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p>\n<p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it&rsquo;s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they&rsquo;re always together.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15801564/chapters/37213079\">Ao3 Link</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177417182754/tjs-playlist-chapter-1\">Chapter 1 Link&nbsp;</a>| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177784471299/tjs-playlist-chapter-4\">Previous Chapter</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/178153409194/tjs-playlist-chapter-6\">Next Chapter</a> |</b></p>\n<p><b>Words:</b> 3264</p>\n</p>",
