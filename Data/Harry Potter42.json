After losing one of your own tragically by a misfired spell during a case, from the enemy, of course, you were all gathered to attend the funeral of your fallen comrade. Listening to the tributes from the family and friends, the words said by your team leader and then a couple of words from the head of the Auror department the funeral was drawn to a close and you were all invited to stay behind to offer the family and friends, to remember the man who had been a big part of your team. However, after weeks of being away from your fiance due to his own mission, you were wanting nothing more than to be at home wrapped up in his arms, relishing the time you could spend together. At the moment, however, you were having to make do with stolen glances at him from across the room, as it was, every time either of you tried to make your towards the other, one of you would be stopped by someone else.

You smile back at him before you say, manage to excuse yourself, not letting anyone stop you from where you wanted to be. Harry seemed to notice this too and rushed towards you as well, greeting you halfway across the room where he winds his arms around your waist, pulling you closer towards him before he whispers</p><p>\u201cI hope no one thinks bad of me for stealing this moment with you Y/N, it&rsquo;s been far too long since I was able to hold you close and kiss you\u201d.
