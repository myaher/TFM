The sky had been burning, the world was quite literally falling apart, and there had been less than 2 hours until complete global annihilation. They\u2019d both seriously thought that all hope had been lost. And so it had seemed&hellip; well, it had just seemed fitting to blurt out that he loved Tony and had done for months. There had been nothing more to lose, and Steve&hellip; Steve didn\u2019t want to leave another life with a dozen things he\u2019d wished he\u2019d done differently.\u00a0</p><p>So he\u2019d said it, in the middle of Tony\u2019s workshop as he\u2019d taken the man by the shoulders and looked deep into his eyes. He hadn\u2019t been afraid, or nervous. All he\u2019d known was that he had to say it, now or never, and that Tony deserved to know.</p><p>He\u2019d never expected Tony to say it back, though. <i>That </i>had been a total surprise. The words had tumbled out of Tony\u2019s mouth after barely a second of silence, and he\u2019d grabbed Steve right back, his hands curling around Steve\u2019s neck, and they\u2019d felt so warm. Shaking a little, scared, but warm. And they were going to die, there was nothing at all holding them back, and so Steve had leaned down to kiss him frantically and Tony returned it, everything so wild and urgent that it felt almost like a dream as they\u2019d grabbed at one another\u2019s clothes and Steve had pushed him up against the desk.</p><p>He and Tony had been having sex while the world was supposedly ending.\u00a0\u2018Out with a bang\u2019, Tony had muttered against his mouth, and Steve had laughed and then come and God, it had been the best thing ever. Even though the world had literally been ending, Steve had still felt&hellip; happy.\u00a0</p><p>Except then the world <i>didn\u2019t </i>end. The day got saved in the nick of goddamn time, everything too fast to even properly get his head around, and both of them had had to suit up without even getting a chance to bask in the afterglow of it all or talk about anything. It had been long and exhausting, and Steve ached. He was dirty, needed a shower.\u00a0</p><p>And Tony was avoiding him.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cJARVIS,\u201d he looked up desperately at the ceiling for the third time that evening,\u00a0\u201chow\u2019s Tony doing?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSir remains healthy and safe,\u201d JARVIS told him apologetically,\u00a0\u201cbut that is all the information I can provide you right now. Apologies, Captain.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve sighed. He\u2019d already asked JARVIS to let Tony know he wanted to talk, so there wasn\u2019t much point in repeating that. Instead, he just nodded somewhat glumly.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just lemme know when he comes outta there, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Captain, it appears he is unlocking the doors as we speak.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve blinked in surprise, then shot up off the bed that he\u2019d been lying on, his tiredness suddenly forgotten. Tony was leaving the shop that he\u2019d locked himself in for the past few days, presumably for a coffee and food restock. It was 2am, so he obviously thought that Steve was asleep.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He jumped to his feet and rushed down the stairs, determined to catch Tony. Steve knew that he may have been too forward, too brash with his feelings, and now he\u2019d declared everything it was all just awkward seeing as they hadn\u2019t&ndash; you know&ndash; immediately died after expressing it all. But that didn\u2019t mean Tony could hide himself away forever. Above the romantic love, Steve valued him as a person and a friend. He didn\u2019t want to lose him over some stupid word and some&hellip; uh, very spectacular sex.\u00a0</p><p>He cornered Tony in the kitchen while the man was shuffling through the cupboards in search of what was, presumably, a new bag of coffee. Steve watched him for a moment, awkward and jerky in a way he only ever was when very sleep deprived, and sighed to himself, leaning over to the cabinet where the bags were actually kept.\u00a0\u201cLooking for this?\u201d</p><p>Tony jumped wildly and turned to him. His eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cSteve,\u201d he declared,\u00a0\u201coh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve gave him a tired smile.\u00a0\u201cHey. Haven\u2019t seen you in a few days.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you know how it is,\u201d Tony waved a hand. He wasn\u2019t looking Steve in the eye.\u00a0\u201cWorld nearly fell apart, now I\u2019ve gotta try put it back together again, y\u2019know, the usual stuff. Should probably get back to it, actually&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe can forget it ever happened, if that would make you more comfortable,\u201d Steve blurted, and he couldn\u2019t help but take Tony by the arm and stop him from walking past him. He didn\u2019t want Tony to run from him. He didn\u2019t want this to fester and get any worse than it already was, and if that meant just hiding his feelings and pretending none of it had been revealed, then that was okay. Steve could handle that. He was good with pain.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony paused, going stiff in Steve\u2019s grip. He blinked rapidly and glanced up, looking at Steve through his eyelashes. He was&hellip; God, he was so beautiful. Steve knew what he looked like when he was a second away from coming, he knew what Tony felt like around him, knew how his sweat tasted against his tongue. Steve had no idea how the hell he was gonna repress all that, but he sure as hell had to. If it meant saving their friendship, Steve would do it in a heartbeat.\u00a0</p><p>There was a stagnant silence for a second. Tony looked back down again, something broken in his expression.\u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d he said throatily, giving a jerky nod,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019d probably be&hellip; right. Just adrenaline, right? You said some stuff you didn\u2019t mean, I got ahead of myself, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d God, that hurt.\u00a0\u201cSure, if that\u2019s what&hellip; alright. I just don\u2019t want to&ndash; I don\u2019t want this to be weird, okay? I don\u2019t wanna lose you over a mistake I made.\u201d</p><p>Tony visibly blanched at that, and Steve\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion. Before he could open his mouth, though, Tony was pulling away viciously and turning his back.\u00a0\u201cA mistake,\u201d he said slowly,\u00a0\u201cright. Okay, well, I mean, I kinda figured&ndash; it\u2019s not like you could ever <i>actually </i>love me, right? That\u2019s&hellip; yeah. Haha.\u201d His voice was numb, a little&hellip; broken. He sounded too quiet for himself, and Steve just felt as if he was making everything worse as opposed to better, dammit.\u00a0</p><p>Tony began to walk away, and no, no no no, Steve couldn\u2019t let him run now, not when things were still so stiff.\u00a0\u201cTony, wait&ndash;\u201d he stumbled forward and rounded on him, before almost tripping over his own feet once his spun around and took another look at the other man.\u00a0</p><p>Tony was <i>crying</i>. Well&ndash; at least&ndash; his eyes were watering, and a tear was threatening to spill right over his eyelashes and down his cheek. He looked like a rabbit caught in the headlights, surprised that Steve would follow him, and hastily wiped at his face. But the damage was done, and Steve had seen.</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d he said, both incredulous and worried as he raised his hands to Tony\u2019s shoulders,\u00a0\u201cTony, are you&ndash; what did I&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJust <i>fuck off</i>, Rogers,\u201d Tony spat at him, slapping Steve\u2019s hands away before they could settle on his shoulders. Suddenly there was anger there, in every line of his body, in every flicker of his face. He snarled at Steve.\u00a0\u201cJust fuck off. I knew this would happen as soon as Thor came back and saved the fucking day, I knew you\u2019d&hellip; and that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay to regret shit you do in the heat of the moment, but excuse me for disliking being called a <i>mistake</i>, when this, for <i>me</i>, was the one thing that I\u2019ve been 100% sure of for&ndash; for fucking ever, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands shook as he pulled them through his hair and glowered at Steve, but it was full of pain, and it didn\u2019t work the way it should have done. Steve could only gape at him as the man\u2019s face turned cold, carefully blank and empty of anything traitorous.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me, Steve, alright, I get it,\u201d he said quietly,\u00a0\u201cyou wanna forget it, that\u2019s okay too. But just don\u2019t call it&ndash; don\u2019t&hellip; oh Jesus, what am I even <i>saying?\u201d </i>Tony waved a hand, snappish and fast through the air as he turned back away. \u201cDo whatever the fuck you want, Rogers. I\u2019ll be in my workshop, where I should have fucking stayed. Leave me alone&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the mistake I was talking about,\u201d Steve said quietly, understanding what Tony must have taken from that conversation and suddenly seeing the light dawn on him. And not a moment too soon, because Tony was clearly taking a very different viewpoint on this matter, and it was one Steve needed to change.\u00a0\u201cMe being in love with you wasn\u2019t a mistake. Us having sex wasn\u2019t&ndash; that wasn\u2019t a mistake either, not to me.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony stilled, still facing the other way.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d he said, and it was tired, defeated, like he wasn\u2019t even daring to hope for something good to come out of Steve\u2019s explanation.\u00a0</p><p>Steve stumbled forward and took his arm again, gently turning him around. His hands covered Tony\u2019s shoulders easily; he was so small in comparison to him, and Steve had always loved that.\u00a0\u201cI thought&ndash; you were avoiding me, and I thought it was because you\u2019d been freaked out by me telling you I love you. I was afraid I\u2019d ruined things between us because of my feelings, and I was terrified I was gonna lose you as a friend. <i>That </i>was the mistake I was talking about. But I&hellip;\u201d he bit his lip. <i>Come on, Rogers, just fucking say it.</i>\u00a0\u201cBut loving you, having sex with you, that wasn\u2019t&ndash; wouldn\u2019t <i>ever </i>be something I could regret or something I would want to take back. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Tony finally glanced back up at him. His brow furrowed in fragile confusion, looking at Steve through the curl of his eyelashes.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d he began quietly,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s not right. You wouldn\u2019t&ndash; not really. You\u2019re just confused, Steve, we had sex and it was your first time and you got&hellip; you don\u2019t really feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how I feel,\u201d Steve told him with a shake of his head. Suddenly it became a little clearer why Tony had been hiding. He seriously thought that Steve just just&hellip; said it accidentally. That he would regret it once it was over. And, he supposed, he hadn\u2019t exactly helped much by calling it a mistake. Great fucking choice of words there.\u00a0</p><p>He squeezed Tony\u2019s shoulders and then slid his hands upward, cupping them around Tony\u2019s neck and tilting the man\u2019s head up so he was looking straight in Steve\u2019s eyes. There was something horribly vulnerable in Tony\u2019s face, and Steve had never wanted to kiss someone so badly in his entire life, just to try and see if that\u2019d make it go away.\u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how I look at you,\u201d he continued gently, feeling the way Tony\u2019s pulse was getting quicker under his fingers,\u00a0\u201cyou have no idea how many of my sketchbooks are filled with drawings of you. You have no idea how beautiful you look when you\u2019re happy, Tony, but I do. I know. Because I love you, and I have done for a while, and so when the world was about to end and I knew there was no chance of ever ruining our friendship, I bit the damn bullet and just told you before it was too late.\u201d</p><p>He gave Tony a few seconds to process it. The man seemed to have temporarily frozen up, looking at Steve blankly as if he was talking a foreign language.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou love me,\u201d he repeated blankly, lifting his eyebrows,\u00a0\u201cyou really. Love me.\u201d</p><p style=\"\">\u201cYep.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony blinked once, twice, three times.\u00a0\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&hellip; you don\u2019t have to say it back, I know that everything was hectic and like, you might not want to try anything else, but I just wanted to&ndash;\u201d</p><p>Tony surged forward, wrapping his arms around Steve\u2019s shoulders and locking their mouths together sharply before Steve could continue. He was hot, the taste of him familiar and lovely, and Steve melted underneath him, sucking in a sharp breath through his nose and pushing back against Tony\u2019s mouth. Tony gasped, lips parting, and Steve just wanted to take the breath right out of Tony\u2019s mouth, wanted every piece of him he could get. Five minutes ago he hadn\u2019t even thought this would be a possibility he could achieve again. But their lives were just like that- fast and hectic and ever-evolving, and Steve wouldn\u2019t change any of it for the world.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Tony murmured, licking into Steve\u2019s mouth as delicately as a flower petal,\u00a0\u201cI love you so much, I thought&hellip; I thought that you didn\u2019t want me, I thought you\u2019d wanna take it back, fuck, I was so scared of hearing you say that, Steve-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Steve shook his head, hearing Tony moan a little as his back hit the counter and oh, since when had he even been pushing Tony in that direction? He didn\u2019t even know what he was doing with himself.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever want to take that night back. I swear, it\u2019s you. I love you. I do.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony sighed in relief, his body falling even further into Steve\u2019s as his hands sunk from his shoulders to curl instead around Steve\u2019s waist. After a few seconds, their kissing petered out into nothing more than a close embrace, Tony\u2019s cheek slumped into Steve\u2019s shoulder and Steve resting his jaw against Tony\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u00a0They stood there in the kitchen and both breathed one another in, heart to heart, eyes closed. Steve wanted to take him apart again right here and now, show him just how much Steve fucking cared, how real all his words were. But he also knew that Tony was exhausted, and so it would have to wait a little bit. Steve was fine with that. For now, he could just work on trying to make the other man sleep in a bed. Preferably Steve\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u00a0Jesus, Tony might actually sleep in his bed tonight. They might be able to cuddle. And it was so <i>so </i>fucking cliched, but God, it was what Steve wanted. Tony in his arms, sleeping softly, comfortable with him in a way that he\u2019d always dreamed of.\u00a0All it had taken was the Almost End of the world to bring it about.</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed?\u201d Tony asked, a vulnerable note to his voice again, still unsure whether all this would be taken away from him if he closed his eyes for too long.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Steve leaned down, kissing him gently and slow. Tony\u2019s mouth parted easily under him and he had to repress the urge to deepen it. They had plenty of time for that later, after all.\u00a0</p><p>Instead, he twined their fingers together and smiled.\u00a0\u201cHappily.\u201d</p><p style=\"\">-</p><p><i><a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/itsallavengers\" target=\"_blank\">Like my work?

I just don\u2019t want to\u2013 I don\u2019t want this to be weird, okay? I don\u2019t wanna lose you over a mistake I made.\u201d</p><p>Tony visibly blanched at that, and Steve\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion. Before he could open his mouth, though, Tony was pulling away viciously and turning his back.\u00a0\u201cA mistake,\u201d he said slowly,\u00a0\u201cright. Okay, well, I mean, I kinda figured\u2013 it\u2019s not like you could ever <i>actually </i>love me, right? That\u2019s\u2026 yeah. Haha.\u201d His voice was numb, a little\u2026 broken. He sounded too quiet for himself, and Steve just felt as if he was making everything worse as opposed to better, dammit.\u00a0</p><p>Tony began to walk away, and no, no no no, Steve couldn\u2019t let him run now, not when things were still so stiff.\u00a0\u201cTony, wait\u2013\u201d he stumbled forward and rounded on him, before almost tripping over his own feet once his spun around and took another look at the other man.\u00a0</p><p>Tony was <i>crying</i>. Well\u2013 at least\u2013 his eyes were watering, and a tear was threatening to spill right over his eyelashes and down his cheek. He looked like a rabbit caught in the headlights, surprised that Steve would follow him, and hastily wiped at his face. But the damage was done, and Steve had seen.</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d he said, both incredulous and worried as he raised his hands to Tony\u2019s shoulders,\u00a0\u201cTony, are you\u2013 what did I\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust <i>fuck off</i>, Rogers,\u201d Tony spat at him, slapping Steve\u2019s hands away before they could settle on his shoulders. Suddenly there was anger there, in every line of his body, in every flicker of his face. He snarled at Steve.\u00a0\u201cJust fuck off. I knew this would happen as soon as Thor came back and saved the fucking day, I knew you\u2019d\u2026 and that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay to regret shit you do in the heat of the moment, but excuse me for disliking being called a <i>mistake</i>, when this, for <i>me</i>, was the one thing that I\u2019ve been 100% sure of for\u2013 for fucking ever, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands shook as he pulled them through his hair and glowered at Steve, but it was full of pain, and it didn\u2019t work the way it should have done. Steve could only gape at him as the man\u2019s face turned cold, carefully blank and empty of anything traitorous.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me, Steve, alright, I get it,\u201d he said quietly,\u00a0\u201cyou wanna forget it, that\u2019s okay too. But just don\u2019t call it\u2013 don\u2019t\u2026 oh Jesus, what am I even <i>saying?\u201d </i>Tony waved a hand, snappish and fast through the air as he turned back away. \u201cDo whatever the fuck you want, Rogers. I\u2019ll be in my workshop, where I should have fucking stayed. Leave me alone\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the mistake I was talking about,\u201d Steve said quietly, understanding what Tony must have taken from that conversation and suddenly seeing the light dawn on him. And not a moment too soon, because Tony was clearly taking a very different viewpoint on this matter, and it was one Steve needed to change.\u00a0\u201cMe being in love with you wasn\u2019t a mistake. Us having sex wasn\u2019t\u2013 that wasn\u2019t a mistake either, not to me.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony stilled, still facing the other way.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d he said, and it was tired, defeated, like he wasn\u2019t even daring to hope for something good to come out of Steve\u2019s explanation.\u00a0</p><p>Steve stumbled forward and took his arm again, gently turning him around. His hands covered Tony\u2019s shoulders easily; he was so small in comparison to him, and Steve had always loved that.\u00a0\u201cI thought\u2013 you were avoiding me, and I thought it was because you\u2019d been freaked out by me telling you I love you. I was afraid I\u2019d ruined things between us because of my feelings, and I was terrified I was gonna lose you as a friend. <i>That </i>was the mistake I was talking about. But I\u2026\u201d he bit his lip. <i>Come on, Rogers, just fucking say it.</i>\u00a0\u201cBut loving you, having sex with you, that wasn\u2019t\u2013 wouldn\u2019t <i>ever </i>be something I could regret or something I would want to take back. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Tony finally glanced back up at him. His brow furrowed in fragile confusion, looking at Steve through the curl of his eyelashes.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d he began quietly,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s not right. You wouldn\u2019t\u2013 not really. You\u2019re just confused, Steve, we had sex and it was your first time and you got\u2026 you don\u2019t really feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how I feel,\u201d Steve told him with a shake of his head. Suddenly it became a little clearer why Tony had been hiding. He seriously thought that Steve just just\u2026 said it accidentally. That he would regret it once it was over. And, he supposed, he hadn\u2019t exactly helped much by calling it a mistake. Great fucking choice of words there.\u00a0</p><p>He squeezed Tony\u2019s shoulders and then slid his hands upward, cupping them around Tony\u2019s neck and tilting the man\u2019s head up so he was looking straight in Steve\u2019s eyes. There was something horribly vulnerable in Tony\u2019s face, and Steve had never wanted to kiss someone so badly in his entire life, just to try and see if that\u2019d make it go away.\u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how I look at you,\u201d he continued gently, feeling the way Tony\u2019s pulse was getting quicker under his fingers,\u00a0\u201cyou have no idea how many of my sketchbooks are filled with drawings of you. You have no idea how beautiful you look when you\u2019re happy, Tony, but I do. I know. Because I love you, and I have done for a while, and so when the world was about to end and I knew there was no chance of ever ruining our friendship, I bit the damn bullet and just told you before it was too late.\u201d</p><p>He gave Tony a few seconds to process it. The man seemed to have temporarily frozen up, looking at Steve blankly as if he was talking a foreign language.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou love me,\u201d he repeated blankly, lifting his eyebrows,\u00a0\u201cyou really. Love me.\u201d</p><p style=\"\">\u201cYep.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony blinked once, twice, three times.\u00a0\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you don\u2019t have to say it back, I know that everything was hectic and like, you might not want to try anything else, but I just wanted to\u2013\u201d</p><p>Tony surged forward, wrapping his arms around Steve\u2019s shoulders and locking their mouths together sharply before Steve could continue. He was hot, the taste of him familiar and lovely, and Steve melted underneath him, sucking in a sharp breath through his nose and pushing back against Tony\u2019s mouth. Tony gasped, lips parting, and Steve just wanted to take the breath right out of Tony\u2019s mouth, wanted every piece of him he could get. Five minutes ago he hadn\u2019t even thought this would be a possibility he could achieve again. But their lives were just like that- fast and hectic and ever-evolving, and Steve wouldn\u2019t change any of it for the world.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Tony murmured, licking into Steve\u2019s mouth as delicately as a flower petal,\u00a0\u201cI love you so much, I thought\u2026 I thought that you didn\u2019t want me, I thought you\u2019d wanna take it back, fuck, I was so scared of hearing you say that, Steve-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Steve shook his head, hearing Tony moan a little as his back hit the counter and oh, since when had he even been pushing Tony in that direction? He didn\u2019t even know what he was doing with himself.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever want to take that night back. I swear, it\u2019s you. I love you. I do.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony sighed in relief, his body falling even further into Steve\u2019s as his hands sunk from his shoulders to curl instead around Steve\u2019s waist. After a few seconds, their kissing petered out into nothing more than a close embrace, Tony\u2019s cheek slumped into Steve\u2019s shoulder and Steve resting his jaw against Tony\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u00a0They stood there in the kitchen and both breathed one another in, heart to heart, eyes closed. Steve wanted to take him apart again right here and now, show him just how much Steve fucking cared, how real all his words were. But he also knew that Tony was exhausted, and so it would have to wait a little bit. Steve was fine with that. For now, he could just work on trying to make the other man sleep in a bed. Preferably Steve\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u00a0Jesus, Tony might actually sleep in his bed tonight. They might be able to cuddle. And it was so <i>so </i>fucking cliched, but God, it was what Steve wanted. Tony in his arms, sleeping softly, comfortable with him in a way that he\u2019d always dreamed of.\u00a0All it had taken was the Almost End of the world to bring it about.</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed?\u201d Tony asked, a vulnerable note to his voice again, still unsure whether all this would be taken away from him if he closed his eyes for too long.\u00a0<br></p><p>Steve leaned down, kissing him gently and slow. Tony\u2019s mouth parted easily under him and he had to repress the urge to deepen it. They had plenty of time for that later, after all.\u00a0</p><p>Instead, he twined their fingers together and smiled.\u00a0\u201cHappily.\u201d</p><p style=\"\">-</p><p><i><a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/itsallavengers\" target=\"_blank\">Like my work?

It was very obvious that his lack of appearance wasn\u2019t just by chance.\u00a0</p><p>Steve knew he shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u00a0</p><p>It was a spur of the moment decision. The sky had been burning, the world was quite literally falling apart, and there had been less than 2 hours until complete global annihilation. They\u2019d both seriously thought that all hope had been lost. And so it had seemed\u2026 well, it had just seemed fitting to blurt out that he loved Tony and had done for months. There had been nothing more to lose, and Steve\u2026 Steve didn\u2019t want to leave another life with a dozen things he\u2019d wished he\u2019d done differently.\u00a0</p><p>So he\u2019d said it, in the middle of Tony\u2019s workshop as he\u2019d taken the man by the shoulders and looked deep into his eyes. He hadn\u2019t been afraid, or nervous. All he\u2019d known was that he had to say it, now or never, and that Tony deserved to know.</p><p>He\u2019d never expected Tony to say it back, though. <i>That </i>had been a total surprise. The words had tumbled out of Tony\u2019s mouth after barely a second of silence, and he\u2019d grabbed Steve right back, his hands curling around Steve\u2019s neck, and they\u2019d felt so warm. Shaking a little, scared, but warm. And they were going to die, there was nothing at all holding them back, and so Steve had leaned down to kiss him frantically and Tony returned it, everything so wild and urgent that it felt almost like a dream as they\u2019d grabbed at one another\u2019s clothes and Steve had pushed him up against the desk.</p><p>He and Tony had been having sex while the world was supposedly ending.\u00a0\u2018Out with a bang\u2019, Tony had muttered against his mouth, and Steve had laughed and then come and God, it had been the best thing ever. Even though the world had literally been ending, Steve had still felt\u2026 happy.\u00a0</p><p>Except then the world <i>didn\u2019t </i>end. The day got saved in the nick of goddamn time, everything too fast to even properly get his head around, and both of them had had to suit up without even getting a chance to bask in the afterglow of it all or talk about anything. It had been long and exhausting, and Steve ached. He was dirty, needed a shower.\u00a0</p><p>And Tony was avoiding him.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cJARVIS,\u201d he looked up desperately at the ceiling for the third time that evening,\u00a0\u201chow\u2019s Tony doing?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSir remains healthy and safe,\u201d JARVIS told him apologetically,\u00a0\u201cbut that is all the information I can provide you right now. Apologies, Captain.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve sighed. He\u2019d already asked JARVIS to let Tony know he wanted to talk, so there wasn\u2019t much point in repeating that. Instead, he just nodded somewhat glumly.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just lemme know when he comes outta there, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Captain, it appears he is unlocking the doors as we speak.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve blinked in surprise, then shot up off the bed that he\u2019d been lying on, his tiredness suddenly forgotten. Tony was leaving the shop that he\u2019d locked himself in for the past few days, presumably for a coffee and food restock. It was 2am, so he obviously thought that Steve was asleep.\u00a0<br></p><p>He jumped to his feet and rushed down the stairs, determined to catch Tony. Steve knew that he may have been too forward, too brash with his feelings, and now he\u2019d declared everything it was all just awkward seeing as they hadn\u2019t\u2013 you know\u2013 immediately died after expressing it all. But that didn\u2019t mean Tony could hide himself away forever. Above the romantic love, Steve valued him as a person and a friend. He didn\u2019t want to lose him over some stupid word and some\u2026 uh, very spectacular sex.\u00a0</p><p>He cornered Tony in the kitchen while the man was shuffling through the cupboards in search of what was, presumably, a new bag of coffee. Steve watched him for a moment, awkward and jerky in a way he only ever was when very sleep deprived, and sighed to himself, leaning over to the cabinet where the bags were actually kept.\u00a0\u201cLooking for this?\u201d</p><p>Tony jumped wildly and turned to him. His eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cSteve,\u201d he declared,\u00a0\u201coh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve gave him a tired smile.\u00a0\u201cHey. Haven\u2019t seen you in a few days.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you know how it is,\u201d Tony waved a hand. He wasn\u2019t looking Steve in the eye.\u00a0\u201cWorld nearly fell apart, now I\u2019ve gotta try put it back together again, y\u2019know, the usual stuff. Should probably get back to it, actually\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe can forget it ever happened, if that would make you more comfortable,\u201d Steve blurted, and he couldn\u2019t help but take Tony by the arm and stop him from walking past him. He didn\u2019t want Tony to run from him. He didn\u2019t want this to fester and get any worse than it already was, and if that meant just hiding his feelings and pretending none of it had been revealed, then that was okay. Steve could handle that. He was good with pain.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony paused, going stiff in Steve\u2019s grip. He blinked rapidly and glanced up, looking at Steve through his eyelashes. He was\u2026 God, he was so beautiful. Steve knew what he looked like when he was a second away from coming, he knew what Tony felt like around him, knew how his sweat tasted against his tongue. Steve had no idea how the hell he was gonna repress all that, but he sure as hell had to. If it meant saving their friendship, Steve would do it in a heartbeat.\u00a0</p><p>There was a stagnant silence for a second. Tony looked back down again, something broken in his expression.\u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d he said throatily, giving a jerky nod,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019d probably be\u2026 right. Just adrenaline, right? You said some stuff you didn\u2019t mean, I got ahead of myself, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d God, that hurt.\u00a0\u201cSure, if that\u2019s what\u2026 alright. I just don\u2019t want to\u2013 I don\u2019t want this to be weird, okay? I don\u2019t wanna lose you over a mistake I made.\u201d</p><p>Tony visibly blanched at that, and Steve\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion. Before he could open his mouth, though, Tony was pulling away viciously and turning his back.\u00a0\u201cA mistake,\u201d he said slowly,\u00a0\u201cright. Okay, well, I mean, I kinda figured\u2013 it\u2019s not like you could ever <i>actually </i>love me, right? That\u2019s\u2026 yeah. Haha.\u201d His voice was numb, a little\u2026 broken. He sounded too quiet for himself, and Steve just felt as if he was making everything worse as opposed to better, dammit.\u00a0</p><p>Tony began to walk away, and no, no no no, Steve couldn\u2019t let him run now, not when things were still so stiff.\u00a0\u201cTony, wait\u2013\u201d he stumbled forward and rounded on him, before almost tripping over his own feet once his spun around and took another look at the other man.\u00a0</p><p>Tony was <i>crying</i>. Well\u2013 at least\u2013 his eyes were watering, and a tear was threatening to spill right over his eyelashes and down his cheek. He looked like a rabbit caught in the headlights, surprised that Steve would follow him, and hastily wiped at his face. But the damage was done, and Steve had seen.</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d he said, both incredulous and worried as he raised his hands to Tony\u2019s shoulders,\u00a0\u201cTony, are you\u2013 what did I\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust <i>fuck off</i>, Rogers,\u201d Tony spat at him, slapping Steve\u2019s hands away before they could settle on his shoulders. Suddenly there was anger there, in every line of his body, in every flicker of his face. He snarled at Steve.\u00a0\u201cJust fuck off. I knew this would happen as soon as Thor came back and saved the fucking day, I knew you\u2019d\u2026 and that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay to regret shit you do in the heat of the moment, but excuse me for disliking being called a <i>mistake</i>, when this, for <i>me</i>, was the one thing that I\u2019ve been 100% sure of for\u2013 for fucking ever, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands shook as he pulled them through his hair and glowered at Steve, but it was full of pain, and it didn\u2019t work the way it should have done. Steve could only gape at him as the man\u2019s face turned cold, carefully blank and empty of anything traitorous.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me, Steve, alright, I get it,\u201d he said quietly,\u00a0\u201cyou wanna forget it, that\u2019s okay too. But just don\u2019t call it\u2013 don\u2019t\u2026 oh Jesus, what am I even <i>saying?\u201d </i>Tony waved a hand, snappish and fast through the air as he turned back away. \u201cDo whatever the fuck you want, Rogers. I\u2019ll be in my workshop, where I should have fucking stayed. Leave me alone\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the mistake I was talking about,\u201d Steve said quietly, understanding what Tony must have taken from that conversation and suddenly seeing the light dawn on him. And not a moment too soon, because Tony was clearly taking a very different viewpoint on this matter, and it was one Steve needed to change.\u00a0\u201cMe being in love with you wasn\u2019t a mistake. Us having sex wasn\u2019t\u2013 that wasn\u2019t a mistake either, not to me.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony stilled, still facing the other way.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d he said, and it was tired, defeated, like he wasn\u2019t even daring to hope for something good to come out of Steve\u2019s explanation.\u00a0</p><p>Steve stumbled forward and took his arm again, gently turning him around. His hands covered Tony\u2019s shoulders easily; he was so small in comparison to him, and Steve had always loved that.\u00a0\u201cI thought\u2013 you were avoiding me, and I thought it was because you\u2019d been freaked out by me telling you I love you. I was afraid I\u2019d ruined things between us because of my feelings, and I was terrified I was gonna lose you as a friend. <i>That </i>was the mistake I was talking about. But I\u2026\u201d he bit his lip. <i>Come on, Rogers, just fucking say it.</i>\u00a0\u201cBut loving you, having sex with you, that wasn\u2019t\u2013 wouldn\u2019t <i>ever </i>be something I could regret or something I would want to take back. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Tony finally glanced back up at him. His brow furrowed in fragile confusion, looking at Steve through the curl of his eyelashes.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d he began quietly,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s not right. You wouldn\u2019t\u2013 not really. You\u2019re just confused, Steve, we had sex and it was your first time and you got\u2026 you don\u2019t really feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how I feel,\u201d Steve told him with a shake of his head. Suddenly it became a little clearer why Tony had been hiding. He seriously thought that Steve just just\u2026 said it accidentally. That he would regret it once it was over. And, he supposed, he hadn\u2019t exactly helped much by calling it a mistake. Great fucking choice of words there.\u00a0</p><p>He squeezed Tony\u2019s shoulders and then slid his hands upward, cupping them around Tony\u2019s neck and tilting the man\u2019s head up so he was looking straight in Steve\u2019s eyes. There was something horribly vulnerable in Tony\u2019s face, and Steve had never wanted to kiss someone so badly in his entire life, just to try and see if that\u2019d make it go away.\u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how I look at you,\u201d he continued gently, feeling the way Tony\u2019s pulse was getting quicker under his fingers,\u00a0\u201cyou have no idea how many of my sketchbooks are filled with drawings of you. You have no idea how beautiful you look when you\u2019re happy, Tony, but I do. I know. Because I love you, and I have done for a while, and so when the world was about to end and I knew there was no chance of ever ruining our friendship, I bit the damn bullet and just told you before it was too late.\u201d</p><p>He gave Tony a few seconds to process it. The man seemed to have temporarily frozen up, looking at Steve blankly as if he was talking a foreign language.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou love me,\u201d he repeated blankly, lifting his eyebrows,\u00a0\u201cyou really. Love me.\u201d</p><p style=\"\">\u201cYep.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony blinked once, twice, three times.\u00a0\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you don\u2019t have to say it back, I know that everything was hectic and like, you might not want to try anything else, but I just wanted to\u2013\u201d</p><p>Tony surged forward, wrapping his arms around Steve\u2019s shoulders and locking their mouths together sharply before Steve could continue. He was hot, the taste of him familiar and lovely, and Steve melted underneath him, sucking in a sharp breath through his nose and pushing back against Tony\u2019s mouth. Tony gasped, lips parting, and Steve just wanted to take the breath right out of Tony\u2019s mouth, wanted every piece of him he could get. Five minutes ago he hadn\u2019t even thought this would be a possibility he could achieve again. But their lives were just like that- fast and hectic and ever-evolving, and Steve wouldn\u2019t change any of it for the world.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Tony murmured, licking into Steve\u2019s mouth as delicately as a flower petal,\u00a0\u201cI love you so much, I thought\u2026 I thought that you didn\u2019t want me, I thought you\u2019d wanna take it back, fuck, I was so scared of hearing you say that, Steve-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Steve shook his head, hearing Tony moan a little as his back hit the counter and oh, since when had he even been pushing Tony in that direction? He didn\u2019t even know what he was doing with himself.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever want to take that night back. I swear, it\u2019s you. I love you. I do.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony sighed in relief, his body falling even further into Steve\u2019s as his hands sunk from his shoulders to curl instead around Steve\u2019s waist. After a few seconds, their kissing petered out into nothing more than a close embrace, Tony\u2019s cheek slumped into Steve\u2019s shoulder and Steve resting his jaw against Tony\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u00a0They stood there in the kitchen and both breathed one another in, heart to heart, eyes closed. Steve wanted to take him apart again right here and now, show him just how much Steve fucking cared, how real all his words were. But he also knew that Tony was exhausted, and so it would have to wait a little bit. Steve was fine with that. For now, he could just work on trying to make the other man sleep in a bed. Preferably Steve\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u00a0Jesus, Tony might actually sleep in his bed tonight. They might be able to cuddle. And it was so <i>so </i>fucking cliched, but God, it was what Steve wanted. Tony in his arms, sleeping softly, comfortable with him in a way that he\u2019d always dreamed of.\u00a0All it had taken was the Almost End of the world to bring it about.</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed?\u201d Tony asked, a vulnerable note to his voice again, still unsure whether all this would be taken away from him if he closed his eyes for too long.\u00a0<br></p><p>Steve leaned down, kissing him gently and slow. Tony\u2019s mouth parted easily under him and he had to repress the urge to deepen it. They had plenty of time for that later, after all.\u00a0</p><p>Instead, he twined their fingers together and smiled.\u00a0\u201cHappily.\u201d</p><p style=\"\">-</p><p><i><a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/itsallavengers\" target=\"_blank\">Like my work?

It was very obvious that his lack of appearance wasn&rsquo;t just by chance.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve knew he shouldn&rsquo;t have said anything.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a spur of the moment decision. The sky had been burning, the world was quite literally falling apart, and there had been less than 2 hours until complete global annihilation. They&rsquo;d both seriously thought that all hope had been lost. And so it had seemed&hellip; well, it had just seemed fitting to blurt out that he loved Tony and had done for months. There had been nothing more to lose, and Steve&hellip; Steve didn&rsquo;t want to leave another life with a dozen things he&rsquo;d wished he&rsquo;d done differently.&nbsp;</p><p>So he&rsquo;d said it, in the middle of Tony&rsquo;s workshop as he&rsquo;d taken the man by the shoulders and looked deep into his eyes. He hadn&rsquo;t been afraid, or nervous. All he&rsquo;d known was that he had to say it, now or never, and that Tony deserved to know.</p><p>He&rsquo;d never expected Tony to say it back, though. <i>That </i>had been a total surprise. The words had tumbled out of Tony&rsquo;s mouth after barely a second of silence, and he&rsquo;d grabbed Steve right back, his hands curling around Steve&rsquo;s neck, and they&rsquo;d felt so warm. Shaking a little, scared, but warm. And they were going to die, there was nothing at all holding them back, and so Steve had leaned down to kiss him frantically and Tony returned it, everything so wild and urgent that it felt almost like a dream as they&rsquo;d grabbed at one another&rsquo;s clothes and Steve had pushed him up against the desk.</p><p>He and Tony had been having sex while the world was supposedly ending.&nbsp;&lsquo;Out with a bang&rsquo;, Tony had muttered against his mouth, and Steve had laughed and then come and God, it had been the best thing ever. Even though the world had literally been ending, Steve had still felt&hellip; happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Except then the world <i>didn&rsquo;t </i>end. The day got saved in the nick of goddamn time, everything too fast to even properly get his head around, and both of them had had to suit up without even getting a chance to bask in the afterglow of it all or talk about anything. It had been long and exhausting, and Steve ached. He was dirty, needed a shower.&nbsp;</p><p>And Tony was avoiding him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;JARVIS,&rdquo; he looked up desperately at the ceiling for the third time that evening,&nbsp;&ldquo;how&rsquo;s Tony doing?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sir remains healthy and safe,&rdquo; JARVIS told him apologetically,&nbsp;&ldquo;but that is all the information I can provide you right now. Apologies, Captain.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve sighed. He&rsquo;d already asked JARVIS to let Tony know he wanted to talk, so there wasn&rsquo;t much point in repeating that. Instead, he just nodded somewhat glumly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Just lemme know when he comes outta there, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, Captain, it appears he is unlocking the doors as we speak.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve blinked in surprise, then shot up off the bed that he&rsquo;d been lying on, his tiredness suddenly forgotten. Tony was leaving the shop that he&rsquo;d locked himself in for the past few days, presumably for a coffee and food restock. It was 2am, so he obviously thought that Steve was asleep.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He jumped to his feet and rushed down the stairs, determined to catch Tony. Steve knew that he may have been too forward, too brash with his feelings, and now he&rsquo;d declared everything it was all just awkward seeing as they hadn&rsquo;t&ndash; you know&ndash; immediately died after expressing it all. But that didn&rsquo;t mean Tony could hide himself away forever. Above the romantic love, Steve valued him as a person and a friend. He didn&rsquo;t want to lose him over some stupid word and some&hellip; uh, very spectacular sex.&nbsp;</p><p>He cornered Tony in the kitchen while the man was shuffling through the cupboards in search of what was, presumably, a new bag of coffee. Steve watched him for a moment, awkward and jerky in a way he only ever was when very sleep deprived, and sighed to himself, leaning over to the cabinet where the bags were actually kept.&nbsp;&ldquo;Looking for this?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony jumped wildly and turned to him. His eyes widened.&nbsp;&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; he declared,&nbsp;&ldquo;oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Steve gave him a tired smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey. Haven&rsquo;t seen you in a few days.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, you know how it is,&rdquo; Tony waved a hand. He wasn&rsquo;t looking Steve in the eye.&nbsp;&ldquo;World nearly fell apart, now I&rsquo;ve gotta try put it back together again, y&rsquo;know, the usual stuff. Should probably get back to it, actually&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We can forget it ever happened, if that would make you more comfortable,&rdquo; Steve blurted, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but take Tony by the arm and stop him from walking past him. He didn&rsquo;t want Tony to run from him. He didn&rsquo;t want this to fester and get any worse than it already was, and if that meant just hiding his feelings and pretending none of it had been revealed, then that was okay. Steve could handle that. He was good with pain.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony paused, going stiff in Steve&rsquo;s grip. He blinked rapidly and glanced up, looking at Steve through his eyelashes. He was&hellip; God, he was so beautiful. Steve knew what he looked like when he was a second away from coming, he knew what Tony felt like around him, knew how his sweat tasted against his tongue. Steve had no idea how the hell he was gonna repress all that, but he sure as hell had to. If it meant saving their friendship, Steve would do it in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a stagnant silence for a second. Tony looked back down again, something broken in his expression.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said throatily, giving a jerky nod,&nbsp;&ldquo;that&rsquo;d probably be&hellip; right. Just adrenaline, right? You said some stuff you didn&rsquo;t mean, I got ahead of myself, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; God, that hurt.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, if that&rsquo;s what&hellip; alright. I just don&rsquo;t want to&ndash; I don&rsquo;t want this to be weird, okay? I don&rsquo;t wanna lose you over a mistake I made.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony visibly blanched at that, and Steve&rsquo;s brow furrowed in confusion. Before he could open his mouth, though, Tony was pulling away viciously and turning his back.&nbsp;&ldquo;A mistake,&rdquo; he said slowly,&nbsp;&ldquo;right. Okay, well, I mean, I kinda figured&ndash; it&rsquo;s not like you could ever <i>actually </i>love me, right? That&rsquo;s&hellip; yeah. Haha.&rdquo; His voice was numb, a little&hellip; broken. He sounded too quiet for himself, and Steve just felt as if he was making everything worse as opposed to better, dammit.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony began to walk away, and no, no no no, Steve couldn&rsquo;t let him run now, not when things were still so stiff.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony, wait&ndash;&rdquo; he stumbled forward and rounded on him, before almost tripping over his own feet once his spun around and took another look at the other man.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony was <i>crying</i>. Well&ndash; at least&ndash; his eyes were watering, and a tear was threatening to spill right over his eyelashes and down his cheek. He looked like a rabbit caught in the headlights, surprised that Steve would follow him, and hastily wiped at his face. But the damage was done, and Steve had seen.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; he said, both incredulous and worried as he raised his hands to Tony&rsquo;s shoulders,&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony, are you&ndash; what did I&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just <i>fuck off</i>, Rogers,&rdquo; Tony spat at him, slapping Steve&rsquo;s hands away before they could settle on his shoulders. Suddenly there was anger there, in every line of his body, in every flicker of his face. He snarled at Steve.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just fuck off. I knew this would happen as soon as Thor came back and saved the fucking day, I knew you&rsquo;d&hellip; and that&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay to regret shit you do in the heat of the moment, but excuse me for disliking being called a <i>mistake</i>, when this, for <i>me</i>, was the one thing that I&rsquo;ve been 100% sure of for&ndash; for fucking ever, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hands shook as he pulled them through his hair and glowered at Steve, but it was full of pain, and it didn&rsquo;t work the way it should have done. Steve could only gape at him as the man&rsquo;s face turned cold, carefully blank and empty of anything traitorous.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love me, Steve, alright, I get it,&rdquo; he said quietly,&nbsp;&ldquo;you wanna forget it, that&rsquo;s okay too. But just don&rsquo;t call it&ndash; don&rsquo;t&hellip; oh Jesus, what am I even <i>saying?&rdquo; </i>Tony waved a hand, snappish and fast through the air as he turned back away. &ldquo;Do whatever the fuck you want, Rogers. I&rsquo;ll be in my workshop, where I should have fucking stayed. Leave me alone&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t the mistake I was talking about,&rdquo; Steve said quietly, understanding what Tony must have taken from that conversation and suddenly seeing the light dawn on him. And not a moment too soon, because Tony was clearly taking a very different viewpoint on this matter, and it was one Steve needed to change.&nbsp;&ldquo;Me being in love with you wasn&rsquo;t a mistake. Us having sex wasn&rsquo;t&ndash; that wasn&rsquo;t a mistake either, not to me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony stilled, still facing the other way.&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean,&rdquo; he said, and it was tired, defeated, like he wasn&rsquo;t even daring to hope for something good to come out of Steve&rsquo;s explanation.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve stumbled forward and took his arm again, gently turning him around. His hands covered Tony&rsquo;s shoulders easily; he was so small in comparison to him, and Steve had always loved that.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought&ndash; you were avoiding me, and I thought it was because you&rsquo;d been freaked out by me telling you I love you. I was afraid I&rsquo;d ruined things between us because of my feelings, and I was terrified I was gonna lose you as a friend. <i>That </i>was the mistake I was talking about. But I&hellip;&rdquo; he bit his lip. <i>Come on, Rogers, just fucking say it.</i>&nbsp;&ldquo;But loving you, having sex with you, that wasn&rsquo;t&ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t <i>ever </i>be something I could regret or something I would want to take back. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony finally glanced back up at him. His brow furrowed in fragile confusion, looking at Steve through the curl of his eyelashes.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he began quietly,&nbsp;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s not right. You wouldn&rsquo;t&ndash; not really. You&rsquo;re just confused, Steve, we had sex and it was your first time and you got&hellip; you don&rsquo;t really feel that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea how I feel,&rdquo; Steve told him with a shake of his head.

It was made so that you could communicate with your brother while he was in his suit, saving the world. We&rsquo;ll ever since you and the remaining Avengers faced Thanos and the god had managed to complete his genocide, you used your headset at least once a day. The others had basically assumed that Tony was dead, since he&rsquo;s been missing for so long. Maybe it was your sibling connection but you didn&rsquo;t believe that. </p><p>With your stubborn view that Tony was still out there somewhere in mind, you tried to communicate with him everyday. Your routine was to get up every morning, get dressed, and then throw on your read set. So far, admittedly you&rsquo;ve been unsuccessful but that wouldn&rsquo;t stop you from trying again and again. &ldquo;Tony, come in Tony&rdquo; you said into the microphone that should have been heard through Tony&rsquo;s mask. Yet again you received no response. With a sigh, you took the headset off so you could take a break. </p><p>&ldquo;No word?&rdquo; A voice said, making you spin around in your office chair to see who it was. You quickly spotted Thor standing behind you. Shaking your head you offered him an answer. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing at all&rdquo; you confessed, looking down in defeat. There was a moment of silence before you spoke up once more. &ldquo;You probably think i&rsquo;m being ridiculous, for not giving up and all&rdquo;. Just as you said this years started to drip down your cheeks. Thor shook his head before walking over and engulfing you in a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I understand&rdquo; Thor assured, rubbing your back soothingly. &ldquo;Everything will be okay&rdquo;. </p><p><a href=\"http://lotsoffandomimagines.tumblr.com/ask\"><b>REQUESTS ARE OPEN </b></a></p></p>",
