His encounter with you has put him off his food first and foremost, and he finds himself in need of addressing some business. Jungkook. If he\u2019s mistreated you, and Jin finds his own trust misplaced, there will be hell to pay. You may not be particularly close with Jin anymore, but he still treasures you. He won\u2019t have some new recruit mess around with you.</p><p>Jungkook is familiar with the tactic that Jin\u2019s using on him. He wants to intimidate him, but Jin doesn\u2019t know that much about Jungkook. He\u2019s been subject to these kinds of tactics his entire life, and Jin is no different. It\u2019s not too difficult to maintain eye contact, making clear that he won\u2019t back down,</p><p>\u201cHave you been mistreating Y/N?\u201d Jin enquires, sitting forward and readjusting his suit jacket. He sorely misses the days when jeans were his daily attire. His aura is still filled with confidence though. It\u2019s part of the job - exuding confidence to the point of arrogance out of every pore,</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Is all Jungkook says. His eyes are hardened and trustworthy as they have been for a long time. His exterior is cool and collected, recognising that Jin will not be as friendly with him as he usually is. Well, not necessarily friendly. Just\u2026 not hostile. However, Jungkook\u2019s mind is rife with thoughts of you, the past you share and regret for ever going through with the job. How could he have ever lied to you?</p><p>\u201cWell, she must have meant something when she insisted that V is nicer to her. Why don\u2019t you give me some theories?\u201d Jin probes, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t even flinch, despite knowing exactly what your problem with him is. He lied to you; he pretended to be someone else and befriended you. He didn\u2019t realise at the time how much he might have hurt you by doing so,</p><p>\u201cI was a little aggressive on that first night when V came to bring her for dinner, but that\u2019s all I can think of. Maybe she just gets an odd vibe from me, and is trusting that,\u201d Jungkook suggests, hating every word. Why is he so good at this? He doesn\u2019t even have to try to manipulate well. It\u2019s like it\u2019s a talent,</p><p>\u201cThat may be true. You may know by now that I have a lot of faith in you, Jungkook, and that faith is hard to come by in this line of work. If you don\u2019t like or trust V, then I\u2019ll assume you have a good reason. Care to share it?\u201d</p><p>Does Jungkook care to share it? What\u2019s the information worth really? He\u2019s not sure it\u2019ll make much of a difference to things at the moment, and if V finds out that Jungkook\u2019s been talking, it could only lead to more trouble for the raven-haired boy. Right now, what he knows wouldn\u2019t benefit him to share, so there\u2019s no point. Best wait for the right moment,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. It\u2019s sensitive information, and I couldn\u2019t tell you one thing without telling you it all,\u201d Jungkook says tactfully, and Jin nods carefully. He has no choice but to allow Jungkook this small victory. Besides, he\u2019ll find out eventually. You can\u2019t keep anything from the head of the biggest gang in Korea, </p><p>\u201cI simply knew V before I came here, and I\u2019m not sure if his intentions are quite as pure as they seem,\u201d Oh. That\u2019s interesting. But Jin can\u2019t wait around to pick it apart right now; he needs to be on his own for that.</p><p>After dismissing Jungkook, Jin makes his way up the main office, refusing to speak with anyone who asks for his time on the way there. That comment from Jungkook means something, and it fits into the maze Jin is wandering through.</p><p>Jin thinks of Jimin. He thinks of Jimin and how he could\u2019ve gone unnoticed as a double agent for so long. How did he miss it? Was it blind trust? Was it a mistake? Or was it that Jin was so desperate for friendship and support that he was willing to buy anything? He never wanted to be a murderer. Like every young boy, Jin wanted to be an astronaut. A footballer. A chef. He wanted to be good, but now, seeing the blood of his friend on his hands, blood that will never wash off, Jin can\u2019t believe that he is. When he started his investigation into his parent\u2019s murder, he never thought it would lead him down this path of violence and ill-placed trust.</p><p>It\u2019s when Jin sits on the back of desk, exhaling heavily that he spots something. Just something small, tucked away unassumingly beneath the leather couch. There shouldn\u2019t be things in this office that Jin doesn\u2019t know about, so it both intrigues him and terrifies him in equal parts.</p><p>It\u2019s a camera. A small, compact, digital one. The kind you can buy in a computer store for a low price. Jin recognises it as easy to operate, with a good image quality. Perfect for close-quarters surveillance\u2026 it must be Jimin\u2019s. What Jin holds in his hands - his bloodied, murderous hands - is all the proof that could verify or destroy the decision to murder his best friend. He physically shakes as he switches it on, desperate to know but terrified about what it could show him.</p><p>The pinboard - the one that Jin uses to track the progress of his investigation. It really is Jimin\u2019s camera. Only him, Namjoon and Jimin have the key to unlock it. Short of breath, Jin races to open the cabinet and compare the images to the evidence in front of him. There are barely any new additions. It\u2019s recent. Jimin must have been feeding this back to Suga, tracking every step Jin took.</p><p>Suga knows about the investigation.</p><p>He knows exactly what Jin does. How close he is, what he wants to find out next, exactly how he plans to do so. The only thing his rival doesn\u2019t know is the endgame. Only Jin and Namjoon know that. The only record of it is kept private, locked in the most secure safe in this mansion. Jin can breathe again, knowing that he may be disadvantaged momentarily, he still has that. Suga doesn\u2019t know for sure what he plans to do with the information he\u2019s gathering.</p><p>However, this revelation does lead to new issues. Jin sets the camera down, momentarily forgetting it as the cogs in his brain whirr. He\u2019s good at his job for a reason. Thinking is what Jin\u2019s good at.</p><p>If Jimin was sent here to monitor Jin as an inside man, there\u2019s no way that Suga doesn\u2019t know about his death. All of Jin\u2019s undercover workers check in regularly in some way, so there\u2019s no way that Suga doesn\u2019t have sustained contact with the man. Especially if he was reporting back with potentially time sensitive information, Jin is sure that Suga knows. It\u2019s only a matter of time before there\u2019s another person integrated into the business.</p><p>One way to solve that - no more new recruits. But if Suga knew Jin was close to the whole truth, he probably increased surveillance a few weeks ago. At least, that\u2019s what Jin would do. He\u2019s had to come to accept that he thinks like Suga does.</p><p>By following the same line of logic, that would single out the only new people in a position of power. V and Jungkook. Jungkook just said that he used to know V, and that he may not be trustworthy. That would imply that they perhaps trained with Suga, and Jungkook left shortly after. Maybe he ended up here by coincidence, and it\u2019s V that\u2019s the traitor. Maybe it\u2019s the other way round.</p><p>Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter much. Neither of them gets particularly sensitive information or access codes, and they\u2019re good to have around for your sake. Particularly V. So with that in mind, Jin makes the decision to do nothing. If nobody comes to the same conclusion and challenges his integrity, that Jin can safely bide his time. Besides, killing off all of Suga\u2019s spies would only clue him in that Jin knows what he\u2019s up to. By leaving things as they are, he regains the upper hand that he unknowingly lost. Suga probably still thinks it\u2019s safe to send his precious Hope here, no doubt. With at least some armed spies remaining, what could go wrong?</p><p>Kim Seokjin. That\u2019s what.</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d You murmur to V as he hands you a slice of bread. He genuinely went to the kitchen and stole half a loaf of bread, and you can\u2019t say you\u2019re surprised. V really is the kind of man to go and steal you bread if you want it, and show you all the best places in the mansion. Although it\u2019s a huge place, you\u2019re finding it easier and easier to find your way round. V\u2019s already made the joke that you should leave bread crumbs in future so you don\u2019t get lost.</p><p>As exciting as the mansion is - genuinely, it\u2019s the kind you would only usually get to see a portion of on National History tours - you eventually get a little sick of being cooped up. With that in mind, you want to start seeing some more of the landscape. It\u2019s largely just well-kept grass, but there are some ponds and small flowerbeds to look at. V is more than happy to take you to the duck pond,</p><p>\u201cYou know, bread is actually pretty bad for ducks,\u201d He notes when you both start feeding them. A few came and jumped onto the bank beside you to grab at the bag in V\u2019s hands. The smile on his face hurts your heart; it\u2019s so genuine and wide as he tries to pet the ducks that you almost forget who he is,</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a little treat for them, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll survive,\u201d You assure him, half distracted by the ducklings swimming around with their mother duck. You find it so easy to talk to V, and the conversation progresses of its own accord. It eventually ends up revolving around him and his life choices,</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not a great life, and it\u2019s hardly sustainable when I lose my charm and my muscles,\u201d He teases, smile wide before falling into something more serious, \u201cBut I don\u2019t really have a choice now. There\u2019s some 10 year gap in my employment history, so I couldn\u2019t get a job without raising questions. I\u2019m stuck here, really,\u201d V sighs, but tries his best to smile at you to save you feeling too sorry for him,</p><p>\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t stuck here,\u201d You mope, handing over your last crust of bread to a shy duck who had hung back when the others charged over,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stuck!\u201d V protests, turning to you with excitement in his eyes, \u201cYou could do anything you want, go anywhere! If you asked Mr Kim nicely, he\u2019d probably let you travel around and get a job and have a life of your own. This is not something a big brother would choose for his little sister,\u201d He elaborates, hands moving wildly to emphasise his point,</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d probably make me take Jungkook with me,\u201d You fire back, eyebrow raised challengingly. You\u2019re not wrong. You couldn\u2019t even go and explore the grounds without some kind of chaperone. You had someone watch over you while you slept on the first night, bring you down to breakfast\u2026 you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been alone since you got here.</p><p>V tears you out of your thoughts with a scrunch of his nose, showing you that he doesn\u2019t even like Jungkook\u2019s name to be mentioned. You noticed that. When V came to take you down to dinner, and Jungkook got aggressive\u2026 they must have some kind of rivalry. Not that you blame V at all,</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling! Why do you hate him?\u201d You probe. There\u2019s got to be an interesting story there, since V doesn\u2019t seem like the type of person to dislike another so easily,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into detail, but I used to know Jungkook. I knew him quite a long time ago. He wasn\u2019t a good person back then and I don\u2019t believe that he is now,\u201d V explains, expression indecipherable as he watches the ducks squabble over the last piece of bread. You nod absent-mindedly, wondering what the specifics could be, when V asks you a similar question, \u201cWhat did he do to you? Apart from having the most mysterious vibe of the year, of course,\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t even find it within yourself to laugh at V\u2019s jab at the raven-haired man. The one who caused you so much happiness and pain. The one who comforted you and then abandoned you. You hadn\u2019t had any particularly harsh feelings before, but now you know that he lied about who he was. You don\u2019t even know if what he told you was true,</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if it\u2019s a sensitive subject. You can tell me to stop being so nosey, or you can blurt it out in a jumble of nonsense. Either way, nobody will ever know we discussed this at all,\u201d V assures you, and that breaks the wall. Tears well up in your eyes as you think back to that painful time.</p><p>When you moved to America, it became clear that your auntie was very much a career woman, and wouldn\u2019t be around much. That wasn\u2019t so bad, but it did mean that you were mostly left alone to deal with your grief. Apart from contact with Namjoon and Jimin - barely ever with Jin - you were closed off. A few weeks later though, a boy just a little older than you moved in next door. His name was Jayden.</p><p>You were desperate for someone to help, so you opened up to him, and he opened up to you. He was a good friend to you, until he suddenly moved out. You\u2019d brushed it off - Jayden had helped you through the worst bits anyway, so you were a little more capable of facing the world. And you did, until you came back here and you found out that Jayden wasn\u2019t even real, it was just the story made up by one sick man. He fed off of your grief for God only knows what reason.</p><p>The friend who helped you through the darkness wasn\u2019t even real,</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t cry,\u201d V coos, putting an arm around you to pull you into his chest, \u201cHe\u2019s not worth your tears, save them for someone who matters,\u201d You sniffle as you try to pull yourself together, desperate not to lose control of your emotions. If you start properly crying, you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ll ever stop. This new world is so painful, \u201cHave you told Jungkook how you feel? Or anyone?\u201d V asks, and you shake your head, pulling back to push your hair out of your face,</p><p>\u201cNo, he threatened me when I worked it out. I decided not to push it, and just go along with it,\u201d V nods slowly at your response, but his mind is set. He knows he told you this would be in complete confidence, but V has to tell Seokjin what he just found out. He doesn\u2019t want to betray your trust like that, but for your safety he has to tell Seokjin what\u2019s going on. If Jungkook is working for Suga, then Seokjin needs to know he has someone who works for Suga, but who\u2019s loyalty lies elsewhere. He wants to be Seokjin\u2019s inside man. </p><p>His mind is set now.</p><p>After a few more minutes sat by the pond (and several attempts from V to get you to jump in), V declares that there\u2019s one room he wouldn\u2019t forgive himself for not telling you about. And with that statement, he runs off towards the mansion, his light-hearted giggle trailing behind him,</p><p>\u201cV, this is amazing!\u201d You gasp in awe, when he leads you into some kind of cinema room. He explained that it\u2019s mainly used to show training videos, so you weren\u2019t expecting much. The screen is huge, and although the seats aren\u2019t the leathery heaven you find in cinemas, the seats are padded well and it looks comfortable. You can really see yourself watching movies curled up in a fluffy blanket here,</p><p>\u201cIf you want to, you can relax in here. I have to head up to briefing at 3pm and I don\u2019t want to be late. Will you be okay?\u201d V asks, and you smile in response as you mess around with the computer at the front of the room. You\u2019re absolutely going to download Netflix. You don\u2019t notice the way V\u2019s face flushes, or how he shuffles awkwardly. You don\u2019t notice that he\u2019s lying to you,</p><p>\u201cYeah, do you know if there are any fluffy blankets here? It\u2019d be nice to curl up under one,\u201d You wonder out loud, and V snorts in response,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re currently living in a mansion full of men who are content eating porridge for breakfast. You think they stock Disney films and cuddly pyjamas?\u201d He teases, and you blush in embarrassment. He\u2019s got a point, even if it does disappoint you. It would feel more homely with that personal touch, \u201cNo fear, V is here. I\u2019ll grab you a duvet from one of the unused bedrooms, and request at briefing that they throw some cash your way for some nice things,\u201d He assures you, and you thank him, slightly distracted as you log into Netflix.</p><p>V returns a few minutes later with one of the nicer duvets and a heat pack - he says they\u2019re mostly used for muscle injuries, but this mansion can be so cold. You very nearly throw yourself into his arms to thank him but think better of it when you see V\u2019s strained smile. It just breaks your heart, wondering if he\u2019s nervous for briefing. It hardly sounds fun.</p><p>While you choose what to watch, V slips away. He hates lying, but he doesn\u2019t want you to know that he\u2019s about to go to see your brother and tell him most of what you just confided in him. If it wasn\u2019t for your safety, he wouldn\u2019t dare! V knows he isn\u2019t a bad person.</p><p>He isn\u2019t a bad person. That\u2019s the mantra in his head as he explains to the guard by the security door that leads to Seokjin\u2019s office that he needs to speak with him. V only wants the best for people, even if it involves admitting that he\u2019s not been entirely truthful about his past.</p><p>Seokjin calls V in immediately, and he finds the tall man locking up a cabinet with old eyes on his face. When they face each other, V is sure that he sees a look of disgust flash across Jin\u2019s face but maybe it\u2019s a trick of the light. It\u2019s probably just the projection of V\u2019s inner turmoil,</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to speak with me?\u201d Jin prompts, keeping a distance from V. He came to the conclusion that V is one of Suga\u2019s inside men, and now here is in front of him. It\u2019s tempting fate, and Jin doesn\u2019t like it,</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I should tell you something. It\u2019s a little sensitive,\u201d V replies, voice lowered despite nobody being in their general vicinity. Jin sighs, anticipating his thoughts from earlier being confirmed. Just great. If V comes clean, Jin will have no choice but to dispose of him, regardless of how much you like him. He can\u2019t afford to ignore these things publicly. It\u2019ll send the wrong message, \u201cOh but first\u2026 I don\u2019t think Y/N is totally comfortable here. I think it would be a good idea to allow some money to buy homely things like fluffy blankets and her favourite snacks,\u201d V says first, not wanting to forget. Jin starts slightly at this,</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s fine,\u201d He says. That threw him off. He wasn\u2019t expecting it, but he quickly regains his composure. This isn\u2019t what V came to say, \u201cBefore you tell me your main point, let\u2019s move to the office two door down. It\u2019s soundproofed, and I don\u2019t want anyone overhearing us,\u201d Jin says, but that\u2019s not why. He learned from his mistakes. If he has to silence V, it can\u2019t be a spur of the moment thing like Jimin. It has to go unnoticed. For your sake,</p><p>\u201cI was sent here by Suga to spy on you and your sister, and see if I could gain any sensitive information,\u201d V says, and pauses, waiting for Seokjin to react. But, in true CEO style, Seokjin doesn\u2019t even flinch. When he notices that V is waiting for a response, he sighs,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already suspected as much. Is this all you have to tell me? You\u2019re not trying to kill me? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re even armed,\u201d Jin notes, eyebrows pulling together in a slight frown. This isn\u2019t making as much sense as he thought it would. At Seokjin\u2019s words, V takes a deep breath, ready to explain his proposal,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not armed. Actually, I wanted to offer my services to you. I could help you get the upper hand on Suga. I know about your investigation and I think I could help! I can\u2019t help him take you down, and I won\u2019t. Y/N relies on you, and she\u2019s too sweet and young. She lost her parents, and I refuse to let her lose her brother,\u201d V babbles, worried that Jin already knew that. What if he\u2019s already decided he doesn\u2019t want V\u2019s help? Then he has nothing! He\u2019ll have to leave the mafia completely, and like he told you earlier, he can\u2019t do that,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? How could you help me get the upper hand?\u201d Jin prompts, feeling his emotions rise. V mentioned the investigation. He does know about it, and that can\u2019t be good. He subtly shifts in his spot, feeling the revolver tucked into his pocket,</p><p>\u201cI could go back to Suga and tell him that I couldn\u2019t find anything out. I could feed you back information about what he plans to do and help you stop him from finding out how you\u2019re progressing. I just want to make up for my mistakes,\u201d He protests, voice falling to a whisper for his last stamen. But Jin still hears,</p><p>\u201cWhat mistakes?\u201d Jin barks, throwing caution and composure to the wind. If V says what Jin thinks he\u2019s about to say, it won\u2019t matter if the man sees him losing his temper. V shifts on his feet and looks at the floor, unable to meet Jin\u2019s eyes,</p><p>\u201cI was involved that night,\u201d He hisses, barely audible over the sound of his own thumping heart, \u201cJimin gave me access to the security network, and I shut the CCTV down. I killed the alarms and I gave the all clear for the killer to move in. I didn\u2019t mastermind it but\u2026 I managed all ground-level work,\u201d </p><p>That\u2019s it. There was a missing link. A gap in the pinboard that haunted Jin. How did the killer get in? Even with an inside man, even with Jimin right there to let them in, how did they bypass security? Turns out Jin was missing just one letter. V,</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the killer, V?\u201d Jin commands, voice shaking with breathlessness. He\u2019s so close he can almost taste it. His fingers twitch towards his pocket, but he tries desperately to remain neutral as they stand here discussing the murder of his parents,</p><p>\u201cJ-Hope,\u201d That\u2019s exactly what Jin wanted to hear. He has access to Hoseok,</p><p>\u201cHow often do you contact Suga?\u201d He questions, and if he hears what he wants to hear, he can take the next step. V\u2019s answer seals his fate,</p><p>\u201cI was told not to bother unless I uncovered something time sensitive. I haven\u2019t contacted him yet, but I can if you want me to. I just want to do right by you,\u201d V pleads, sensing the desperation of the situation. Jin doesn\u2019t care though. That\u2019s exactly what he needed to hear,</p><p>\u201cIs that all? Anything else to tell me?\u201d Jin can barely keep the growl out of his voice, and when V shakes his head, indicating that he\u2019s told him everything, Jin acts. He pulls the revolver out of his pocket with a sick smile and puts it to V\u2019s forehead. He ignores the wounded look of betrayal and pulls the trigger. You don\u2019t get anywhere being merciful in this business. As the shot rings in his ear and the lifeless form of V collapses backwards, Jin finds himself with a sad smile, \u201cFive,\u201d</p>",

His encounter with you has put him off his food first and foremost, and he finds himself in need of addressing some business. Jungkook. If he\u2019s mistreated you, and Jin finds his own trust misplaced, there will be hell to pay. You may not be particularly close with Jin anymore, but he still treasures you. He won\u2019t have some new recruit mess around with you.</p><p>Jungkook is familiar with the tactic that Jin\u2019s using on him. He wants to intimidate him, but Jin doesn\u2019t know that much about Jungkook. He\u2019s been subject to these kinds of tactics his entire life, and Jin is no different. It\u2019s not too difficult to maintain eye contact, making clear that he won\u2019t back down,</p><p>\u201cHave you been mistreating Y/N?\u201d Jin enquires, sitting forward and readjusting his suit jacket. He sorely misses the days when jeans were his daily attire. His aura is still filled with confidence though. It\u2019s part of the job - exuding confidence to the point of arrogance out of every pore,</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Is all Jungkook says. His eyes are hardened and trustworthy as they have been for a long time. His exterior is cool and collected, recognising that Jin will not be as friendly with him as he usually is. Well, not necessarily friendly. Just\u2026 not hostile. However, Jungkook\u2019s mind is rife with thoughts of you, the past you share and regret for ever going through with the job. How could he have ever lied to you?</p><p>\u201cWell, she must have meant something when she insisted that V is nicer to her. Why don\u2019t you give me some theories?\u201d Jin probes, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t even flinch, despite knowing exactly what your problem with him is. He lied to you; he pretended to be someone else and befriended you. He didn\u2019t realise at the time how much he might have hurt you by doing so,</p><p>\u201cI was a little aggressive on that first night when V came to bring her for dinner, but that\u2019s all I can think of. Maybe she just gets an odd vibe from me, and is trusting that,\u201d Jungkook suggests, hating every word. Why is he so good at this? He doesn\u2019t even have to try to manipulate well. It\u2019s like it\u2019s a talent,</p><p>\u201cThat may be true. You may know by now that I have a lot of faith in you, Jungkook, and that faith is hard to come by in this line of work. If you don\u2019t like or trust V, then I\u2019ll assume you have a good reason. Care to share it?\u201d</p><p>Does Jungkook care to share it? What\u2019s the information worth really? He\u2019s not sure it\u2019ll make much of a difference to things at the moment, and if V finds out that Jungkook\u2019s been talking, it could only lead to more trouble for the raven-haired boy. Right now, what he knows wouldn\u2019t benefit him to share, so there\u2019s no point. Best wait for the right moment,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. It\u2019s sensitive information, and I couldn\u2019t tell you one thing without telling you it all,\u201d Jungkook says tactfully, and Jin nods carefully. He has no choice but to allow Jungkook this small victory. Besides, he\u2019ll find out eventually. You can\u2019t keep anything from the head of the biggest gang in Korea, </p><p>\u201cI simply knew V before I came here, and I\u2019m not sure if his intentions are quite as pure as they seem,\u201d Oh. That\u2019s interesting. But Jin can\u2019t wait around to pick it apart right now; he needs to be on his own for that.</p><p>After dismissing Jungkook, Jin makes his way up the main office, refusing to speak with anyone who asks for his time on the way there. That comment from Jungkook means something, and it fits into the maze Jin is wandering through.</p><p>Jin thinks of Jimin. He thinks of Jimin and how he could\u2019ve gone unnoticed as a double agent for so long. How did he miss it? Was it blind trust? Was it a mistake? Or was it that Jin was so desperate for friendship and support that he was willing to buy anything? He never wanted to be a murderer. Like every young boy, Jin wanted to be an astronaut. A footballer. A chef. He wanted to be good, but now, seeing the blood of his friend on his hands, blood that will never wash off, Jin can\u2019t believe that he is. When he started his investigation into his parent\u2019s murder, he never thought it would lead him down this path of violence and ill-placed trust.</p><p>It\u2019s when Jin sits on the back of desk, exhaling heavily that he spots something. Just something small, tucked away unassumingly beneath the leather couch. There shouldn\u2019t be things in this office that Jin doesn\u2019t know about, so it both intrigues him and terrifies him in equal parts.</p><p>It\u2019s a camera. A small, compact, digital one. The kind you can buy in a computer store for a low price. Jin recognises it as easy to operate, with a good image quality. Perfect for close-quarters surveillance\u2026 it must be Jimin\u2019s. What Jin holds in his hands - his bloodied, murderous hands - is all the proof that could verify or destroy the decision to murder his best friend. He physically shakes as he switches it on, desperate to know but terrified about what it could show him.</p><p>The pinboard - the one that Jin uses to track the progress of his investigation. It really is Jimin\u2019s camera. Only him, Namjoon and Jimin have the key to unlock it. Short of breath, Jin races to open the cabinet and compare the images to the evidence in front of him. There are barely any new additions. It\u2019s recent. Jimin must have been feeding this back to Suga, tracking every step Jin took.</p><p>Suga knows about the investigation.</p><p>He knows exactly what Jin does. How close he is, what he wants to find out next, exactly how he plans to do so. The only thing his rival doesn\u2019t know is the endgame. Only Jin and Namjoon know that. The only record of it is kept private, locked in the most secure safe in this mansion. Jin can breathe again, knowing that he may be disadvantaged momentarily, he still has that. Suga doesn\u2019t know for sure what he plans to do with the information he\u2019s gathering.</p><p>However, this revelation does lead to new issues. Jin sets the camera down, momentarily forgetting it as the cogs in his brain whirr. He\u2019s good at his job for a reason. Thinking is what Jin\u2019s good at.</p><p>If Jimin was sent here to monitor Jin as an inside man, there\u2019s no way that Suga doesn\u2019t know about his death. All of Jin\u2019s undercover workers check in regularly in some way, so there\u2019s no way that Suga doesn\u2019t have sustained contact with the man. Especially if he was reporting back with potentially time sensitive information, Jin is sure that Suga knows. It\u2019s only a matter of time before there\u2019s another person integrated into the business.</p><p>One way to solve that - no more new recruits. But if Suga knew Jin was close to the whole truth, he probably increased surveillance a few weeks ago. At least, that\u2019s what Jin would do. He\u2019s had to come to accept that he thinks like Suga does.</p><p>By following the same line of logic, that would single out the only new people in a position of power. V and Jungkook. Jungkook just said that he used to know V, and that he may not be trustworthy. That would imply that they perhaps trained with Suga, and Jungkook left shortly after. Maybe he ended up here by coincidence, and it\u2019s V that\u2019s the traitor. Maybe it\u2019s the other way round.</p><p>Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter much. Neither of them gets particularly sensitive information or access codes, and they\u2019re good to have around for your sake. Particularly V. So with that in mind, Jin makes the decision to do nothing. If nobody comes to the same conclusion and challenges his integrity, that Jin can safely bide his time. Besides, killing off all of Suga\u2019s spies would only clue him in that Jin knows what he\u2019s up to. By leaving things as they are, he regains the upper hand that he unknowingly lost. Suga probably still thinks it\u2019s safe to send his precious Hope here, no doubt. With at least some armed spies remaining, what could go wrong?</p><p>Kim Seokjin. That\u2019s what.</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d You murmur to V as he hands you a slice of bread. He genuinely went to the kitchen and stole half a loaf of bread, and you can\u2019t say you\u2019re surprised. V really is the kind of man to go and steal you bread if you want it, and show you all the best places in the mansion. Although it\u2019s a huge place, you\u2019re finding it easier and easier to find your way round. V\u2019s already made the joke that you should leave bread crumbs in future so you don\u2019t get lost.</p><p>As exciting as the mansion is - genuinely, it\u2019s the kind you would only usually get to see a portion of on National History tours - you eventually get a little sick of being cooped up. With that in mind, you want to start seeing some more of the landscape. It\u2019s largely just well-kept grass, but there are some ponds and small flowerbeds to look at. V is more than happy to take you to the duck pond,</p><p>\u201cYou know, bread is actually pretty bad for ducks,\u201d He notes when you both start feeding them. A few came and jumped onto the bank beside you to grab at the bag in V\u2019s hands. The smile on his face hurts your heart; it\u2019s so genuine and wide as he tries to pet the ducks that you almost forget who he is,</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a little treat for them, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll survive,\u201d You assure him, half distracted by the ducklings swimming around with their mother duck. You find it so easy to talk to V, and the conversation progresses of its own accord. It eventually ends up revolving around him and his life choices,</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not a great life, and it\u2019s hardly sustainable when I lose my charm and my muscles,\u201d He teases, smile wide before falling into something more serious, \u201cBut I don\u2019t really have a choice now. There\u2019s some 10 year gap in my employment history, so I couldn\u2019t get a job without raising questions. I\u2019m stuck here, really,\u201d V sighs, but tries his best to smile at you to save you feeling too sorry for him,</p><p>\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t stuck here,\u201d You mope, handing over your last crust of bread to a shy duck who had hung back when the others charged over,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stuck!\u201d V protests, turning to you with excitement in his eyes, \u201cYou could do anything you want, go anywhere! If you asked Mr Kim nicely, he\u2019d probably let you travel around and get a job and have a life of your own. This is not something a big brother would choose for his little sister,\u201d He elaborates, hands moving wildly to emphasise his point,</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d probably make me take Jungkook with me,\u201d You fire back, eyebrow raised challengingly. You\u2019re not wrong. You couldn\u2019t even go and explore the grounds without some kind of chaperone. You had someone watch over you while you slept on the first night, bring you down to breakfast\u2026 you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been alone since you got here.</p><p>V tears you out of your thoughts with a scrunch of his nose, showing you that he doesn\u2019t even like Jungkook\u2019s name to be mentioned. You noticed that. When V came to take you down to dinner, and Jungkook got aggressive\u2026 they must have some kind of rivalry. Not that you blame V at all,</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling! Why do you hate him?\u201d You probe. There\u2019s got to be an interesting story there, since V doesn\u2019t seem like the type of person to dislike another so easily,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into detail, but I used to know Jungkook. I knew him quite a long time ago. He wasn\u2019t a good person back then and I don\u2019t believe that he is now,\u201d V explains, expression indecipherable as he watches the ducks squabble over the last piece of bread. You nod absent-mindedly, wondering what the specifics could be, when V asks you a similar question, \u201cWhat did he do to you? Apart from having the most mysterious vibe of the year, of course,\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t even find it within yourself to laugh at V\u2019s jab at the raven-haired man. The one who caused you so much happiness and pain. The one who comforted you and then abandoned you. You hadn\u2019t had any particularly harsh feelings before, but now you know that he lied about who he was. You don\u2019t even know if what he told you was true,</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if it\u2019s a sensitive subject. You can tell me to stop being so nosey, or you can blurt it out in a jumble of nonsense. Either way, nobody will ever know we discussed this at all,\u201d V assures you, and that breaks the wall. Tears well up in your eyes as you think back to that painful time.</p><p>When you moved to America, it became clear that your auntie was very much a career woman, and wouldn\u2019t be around much. That wasn\u2019t so bad, but it did mean that you were mostly left alone to deal with your grief. Apart from contact with Namjoon and Jimin - barely ever with Jin - you were closed off. A few weeks later though, a boy just a little older than you moved in next door. His name was Jayden.</p><p>You were desperate for someone to help, so you opened up to him, and he opened up to you. He was a good friend to you, until he suddenly moved out. You\u2019d brushed it off - Jayden had helped you through the worst bits anyway, so you were a little more capable of facing the world. And you did, until you came back here and you found out that Jayden wasn\u2019t even real, it was just the story made up by one sick man. He fed off of your grief for God only knows what reason.</p><p>The friend who helped you through the darkness wasn\u2019t even real,</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t cry,\u201d V coos, putting an arm around you to pull you into his chest, \u201cHe\u2019s not worth your tears, save them for someone who matters,\u201d You sniffle as you try to pull yourself together, desperate not to lose control of your emotions. If you start properly crying, you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ll ever stop. This new world is so painful, \u201cHave you told Jungkook how you feel? Or anyone?\u201d V asks, and you shake your head, pulling back to push your hair out of your face,</p><p>\u201cNo, he threatened me when I worked it out. I decided not to push it, and just go along with it,\u201d V nods slowly at your response, but his mind is set. He knows he told you this would be in complete confidence, but V has to tell Seokjin what he just found out. He doesn\u2019t want to betray your trust like that, but for your safety he has to tell Seokjin what\u2019s going on. If Jungkook is working for Suga, then Seokjin needs to know he has someone who works for Suga, but who\u2019s loyalty lies elsewhere. He wants to be Seokjin\u2019s inside man. </p><p>His mind is set now.</p><p>After a few more minutes sat by the pond (and several attempts from V to get you to jump in), V declares that there\u2019s one room he wouldn\u2019t forgive himself for not telling you about. And with that statement, he runs off towards the mansion, his light-hearted giggle trailing behind him,</p><p>\u201cV, this is amazing!\u201d You gasp in awe, when he leads you into some kind of cinema room. He explained that it\u2019s mainly used to show training videos, so you weren\u2019t expecting much. The screen is huge, and although the seats aren\u2019t the leathery heaven you find in cinemas, the seats are padded well and it looks comfortable. You can really see yourself watching movies curled up in a fluffy blanket here,</p><p>\u201cIf you want to, you can relax in here. I have to head up to briefing at 3pm and I don\u2019t want to be late. Will you be okay?\u201d V asks, and you smile in response as you mess around with the computer at the front of the room. You\u2019re absolutely going to download Netflix. You don\u2019t notice the way V\u2019s face flushes, or how he shuffles awkwardly. You don\u2019t notice that he\u2019s lying to you,</p><p>\u201cYeah, do you know if there are any fluffy blankets here? It\u2019d be nice to curl up under one,\u201d You wonder out loud, and V snorts in response,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re currently living in a mansion full of men who are content eating porridge for breakfast. You think they stock Disney films and cuddly pyjamas?\u201d He teases, and you blush in embarrassment. He\u2019s got a point, even if it does disappoint you. It would feel more homely with that personal touch, \u201cNo fear, V is here. I\u2019ll grab you a duvet from one of the unused bedrooms, and request at briefing that they throw some cash your way for some nice things,\u201d He assures you, and you thank him, slightly distracted as you log into Netflix.</p><p>V returns a few minutes later with one of the nicer duvets and a heat pack - he says they\u2019re mostly used for muscle injuries, but this mansion can be so cold. You very nearly throw yourself into his arms to thank him but think better of it when you see V\u2019s strained smile. It just breaks your heart, wondering if he\u2019s nervous for briefing. It hardly sounds fun.</p><p>While you choose what to watch, V slips away. He hates lying, but he doesn\u2019t want you to know that he\u2019s about to go to see your brother and tell him most of what you just confided in him. If it wasn\u2019t for your safety, he wouldn\u2019t dare! V knows he isn\u2019t a bad person.</p><p>He isn\u2019t a bad person. That\u2019s the mantra in his head as he explains to the guard by the security door that leads to Seokjin\u2019s office that he needs to speak with him. V only wants the best for people, even if it involves admitting that he\u2019s not been entirely truthful about his past.</p><p>Seokjin calls V in immediately, and he finds the tall man locking up a cabinet with old eyes on his face. When they face each other, V is sure that he sees a look of disgust flash across Jin\u2019s face but maybe it\u2019s a trick of the light. It\u2019s probably just the projection of V\u2019s inner turmoil,</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to speak with me?\u201d Jin prompts, keeping a distance from V. He came to the conclusion that V is one of Suga\u2019s inside men, and now here is in front of him. It\u2019s tempting fate, and Jin doesn\u2019t like it,</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I should tell you something. It\u2019s a little sensitive,\u201d V replies, voice lowered despite nobody being in their general vicinity. Jin sighs, anticipating his thoughts from earlier being confirmed. Just great. If V comes clean, Jin will have no choice but to dispose of him, regardless of how much you like him. He can\u2019t afford to ignore these things publicly. It\u2019ll send the wrong message, \u201cOh but first\u2026 I don\u2019t think Y/N is totally comfortable here. I think it would be a good idea to allow some money to buy homely things like fluffy blankets and her favourite snacks,\u201d V says first, not wanting to forget. Jin starts slightly at this,</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s fine,\u201d He says. That threw him off. He wasn\u2019t expecting it, but he quickly regains his composure. This isn\u2019t what V came to say, \u201cBefore you tell me your main point, let\u2019s move to the office two door down. It\u2019s soundproofed, and I don\u2019t want anyone overhearing us,\u201d Jin says, but that\u2019s not why. He learned from his mistakes. If he has to silence V, it can\u2019t be a spur of the moment thing like Jimin. It has to go unnoticed. For your sake,</p><p>\u201cI was sent here by Suga to spy on you and your sister, and see if I could gain any sensitive information,\u201d V says, and pauses, waiting for Seokjin to react. But, in true CEO style, Seokjin doesn\u2019t even flinch. When he notices that V is waiting for a response, he sighs,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already suspected as much. Is this all you have to tell me? You\u2019re not trying to kill me? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re even armed,\u201d Jin notes, eyebrows pulling together in a slight frown. This isn\u2019t making as much sense as he thought it would. At Seokjin\u2019s words, V takes a deep breath, ready to explain his proposal,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not armed. Actually, I wanted to offer my services to you. I could help you get the upper hand on Suga. I know about your investigation and I think I could help! I can\u2019t help him take you down, and I won\u2019t. Y/N relies on you, and she\u2019s too sweet and young. She lost her parents, and I refuse to let her lose her brother,\u201d V babbles, worried that Jin already knew that. What if he\u2019s already decided he doesn\u2019t want V\u2019s help? Then he has nothing! He\u2019ll have to leave the mafia completely, and like he told you earlier, he can\u2019t do that,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? How could you help me get the upper hand?\u201d Jin prompts, feeling his emotions rise. V mentioned the investigation. He does know about it, and that can\u2019t be good. He subtly shifts in his spot, feeling the revolver tucked into his pocket,</p><p>\u201cI could go back to Suga and tell him that I couldn\u2019t find anything out. I could feed you back information about what he plans to do and help you stop him from finding out how you\u2019re progressing. I just want to make up for my mistakes,\u201d He protests, voice falling to a whisper for his last stamen. But Jin still hears,</p><p>\u201cWhat mistakes?\u201d Jin barks, throwing caution and composure to the wind. If V says what Jin thinks he\u2019s about to say, it won\u2019t matter if the man sees him losing his temper. V shifts on his feet and looks at the floor, unable to meet Jin\u2019s eyes,</p><p>\u201cI was involved that night,\u201d He hisses, barely audible over the sound of his own thumping heart, \u201cJimin gave me access to the security network, and I shut the CCTV down. I killed the alarms and I gave the all clear for the killer to move in. I didn\u2019t mastermind it but\u2026 I managed all ground-level work,\u201d </p><p>That\u2019s it. There was a missing link. A gap in the pinboard that haunted Jin. How did the killer get in? Even with an inside man, even with Jimin right there to let them in, how did they bypass security? Turns out Jin was missing just one letter. V,</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the killer, V?\u201d Jin commands, voice shaking with breathlessness. He\u2019s so close he can almost taste it. His fingers twitch towards his pocket, but he tries desperately to remain neutral as they stand here discussing the murder of his parents,</p><p>\u201cJ-Hope,\u201d That\u2019s exactly what Jin wanted to hear. He has access to Hoseok,</p><p>\u201cHow often do you contact Suga?\u201d He questions, and if he hears what he wants to hear, he can take the next step. V\u2019s answer seals his fate,</p><p>\u201cI was told not to bother unless I uncovered something time sensitive. I haven\u2019t contacted him yet, but I can if you want me to. I just want to do right by you,\u201d V pleads, sensing the desperation of the situation. Jin doesn\u2019t care though. That\u2019s exactly what he needed to hear,</p><p>\u201cIs that all? Anything else to tell me?\u201d Jin can barely keep the growl out of his voice, and when V shakes his head, indicating that he\u2019s told him everything, Jin acts. He pulls the revolver out of his pocket with a sick smile and puts it to V\u2019s forehead. He ignores the wounded look of betrayal and pulls the trigger. You don\u2019t get anywhere being merciful in this business. As the shot rings in his ear and the lifeless form of V collapses backwards, Jin finds himself with a sad smile, \u201cFive,\u201d</p></p>",

His encounter with you has put him off his food first and foremost, and he finds himself in need of addressing some business. Jungkook. If he\u2019s mistreated you, and Jin finds his own trust misplaced, there will be hell to pay. You may not be particularly close with Jin anymore, but he still treasures you. He won\u2019t have some new recruit mess around with you.</p><p>Jungkook is familiar with the tactic that Jin\u2019s using on him. He wants to intimidate him, but Jin doesn\u2019t know that much about Jungkook. He\u2019s been subject to these kinds of tactics his entire life, and Jin is no different. It\u2019s not too difficult to maintain eye contact, making clear that he won\u2019t back down,</p><p>\u201cHave you been mistreating Y/N?\u201d Jin enquires, sitting forward and readjusting his suit jacket. He sorely misses the days when jeans were his daily attire. His aura is still filled with confidence though. It\u2019s part of the job - exuding confidence to the point of arrogance out of every pore,</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Is all Jungkook says. His eyes are hardened and trustworthy as they have been for a long time. His exterior is cool and collected, recognising that Jin will not be as friendly with him as he usually is. Well, not necessarily friendly. Just\u2026 not hostile. However, Jungkook\u2019s mind is rife with thoughts of you, the past you share and regret for ever going through with the job. How could he have ever lied to you?</p><p>\u201cWell, she must have meant something when she insisted that V is nicer to her. Why don\u2019t you give me some theories?\u201d Jin probes, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t even flinch, despite knowing exactly what your problem with him is. He lied to you; he pretended to be someone else and befriended you. He didn\u2019t realise at the time how much he might have hurt you by doing so,</p><p>\u201cI was a little aggressive on that first night when V came to bring her for dinner, but that\u2019s all I can think of. Maybe she just gets an odd vibe from me, and is trusting that,\u201d Jungkook suggests, hating every word. Why is he so good at this? He doesn\u2019t even have to try to manipulate well. It\u2019s like it\u2019s a talent,</p><p>\u201cThat may be true. You may know by now that I have a lot of faith in you, Jungkook, and that faith is hard to come by in this line of work. If you don\u2019t like or trust V, then I\u2019ll assume you have a good reason. Care to share it?\u201d</p><p>Does Jungkook care to share it? What\u2019s the information worth really? He\u2019s not sure it\u2019ll make much of a difference to things at the moment, and if V finds out that Jungkook\u2019s been talking, it could only lead to more trouble for the raven-haired boy. Right now, what he knows wouldn\u2019t benefit him to share, so there\u2019s no point. Best wait for the right moment,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. It\u2019s sensitive information, and I couldn\u2019t tell you one thing without telling you it all,\u201d Jungkook says tactfully, and Jin nods carefully. He has no choice but to allow Jungkook this small victory. Besides, he\u2019ll find out eventually. You can\u2019t keep anything from the head of the biggest gang in Korea, </p><p>\u201cI simply knew V before I came here, and I\u2019m not sure if his intentions are quite as pure as they seem,\u201d Oh. That\u2019s interesting. But Jin can\u2019t wait around to pick it apart right now; he needs to be on his own for that.</p><p>After dismissing Jungkook, Jin makes his way up the main office, refusing to speak with anyone who asks for his time on the way there. That comment from Jungkook means something, and it fits into the maze Jin is wandering through.</p><p>Jin thinks of Jimin. He thinks of Jimin and how he could\u2019ve gone unnoticed as a double agent for so long. How did he miss it? Was it blind trust? Was it a mistake? Or was it that Jin was so desperate for friendship and support that he was willing to buy anything? He never wanted to be a murderer. Like every young boy, Jin wanted to be an astronaut. A footballer. A chef. He wanted to be good, but now, seeing the blood of his friend on his hands, blood that will never wash off, Jin can\u2019t believe that he is. When he started his investigation into his parent\u2019s murder, he never thought it would lead him down this path of violence and ill-placed trust.</p><p>It\u2019s when Jin sits on the back of desk, exhaling heavily that he spots something. Just something small, tucked away unassumingly beneath the leather couch. There shouldn\u2019t be things in this office that Jin doesn\u2019t know about, so it both intrigues him and terrifies him in equal parts.</p><p>It\u2019s a camera. A small, compact, digital one. The kind you can buy in a computer store for a low price. Jin recognises it as easy to operate, with a good image quality. Perfect for close-quarters surveillance\u2026 it must be Jimin\u2019s. What Jin holds in his hands - his bloodied, murderous hands - is all the proof that could verify or destroy the decision to murder his best friend. He physically shakes as he switches it on, desperate to know but terrified about what it could show him.</p><p>The pinboard - the one that Jin uses to track the progress of his investigation. It really is Jimin\u2019s camera. Only him, Namjoon and Jimin have the key to unlock it. Short of breath, Jin races to open the cabinet and compare the images to the evidence in front of him. There are barely any new additions. It\u2019s recent. Jimin must have been feeding this back to Suga, tracking every step Jin took.</p><p>Suga knows about the investigation.</p><p>He knows exactly what Jin does. How close he is, what he wants to find out next, exactly how he plans to do so. The only thing his rival doesn\u2019t know is the endgame. Only Jin and Namjoon know that. The only record of it is kept private, locked in the most secure safe in this mansion. Jin can breathe again, knowing that he may be disadvantaged momentarily, he still has that. Suga doesn\u2019t know for sure what he plans to do with the information he\u2019s gathering.</p><p>However, this revelation does lead to new issues. Jin sets the camera down, momentarily forgetting it as the cogs in his brain whirr. He\u2019s good at his job for a reason. Thinking is what Jin\u2019s good at.</p><p>If Jimin was sent here to monitor Jin as an inside man, there\u2019s no way that Suga doesn\u2019t know about his death. All of Jin\u2019s undercover workers check in regularly in some way, so there\u2019s no way that Suga doesn\u2019t have sustained contact with the man. Especially if he was reporting back with potentially time sensitive information, Jin is sure that Suga knows. It\u2019s only a matter of time before there\u2019s another person integrated into the business.</p><p>One way to solve that - no more new recruits. But if Suga knew Jin was close to the whole truth, he probably increased surveillance a few weeks ago. At least, that\u2019s what Jin would do. He\u2019s had to come to accept that he thinks like Suga does.</p><p>By following the same line of logic, that would single out the only new people in a position of power. V and Jungkook. Jungkook just said that he used to know V, and that he may not be trustworthy. That would imply that they perhaps trained with Suga, and Jungkook left shortly after. Maybe he ended up here by coincidence, and it\u2019s V that\u2019s the traitor. Maybe it\u2019s the other way round.</p><p>Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter much. Neither of them gets particularly sensitive information or access codes, and they\u2019re good to have around for your sake. Particularly V. So with that in mind, Jin makes the decision to do nothing. If nobody comes to the same conclusion and challenges his integrity, that Jin can safely bide his time. Besides, killing off all of Suga\u2019s spies would only clue him in that Jin knows what he\u2019s up to. By leaving things as they are, he regains the upper hand that he unknowingly lost. Suga probably still thinks it\u2019s safe to send his precious Hope here, no doubt. With at least some armed spies remaining, what could go wrong?</p><p>Kim Seokjin. That\u2019s what.</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d You murmur to V as he hands you a slice of bread. He genuinely went to the kitchen and stole half a loaf of bread, and you can\u2019t say you\u2019re surprised. V really is the kind of man to go and steal you bread if you want it, and show you all the best places in the mansion. Although it\u2019s a huge place, you\u2019re finding it easier and easier to find your way round. V\u2019s already made the joke that you should leave bread crumbs in future so you don\u2019t get lost.</p><p>As exciting as the mansion is - genuinely, it\u2019s the kind you would only usually get to see a portion of on National History tours - you eventually get a little sick of being cooped up. With that in mind, you want to start seeing some more of the landscape. It\u2019s largely just well-kept grass, but there are some ponds and small flowerbeds to look at. V is more than happy to take you to the duck pond,</p><p>\u201cYou know, bread is actually pretty bad for ducks,\u201d He notes when you both start feeding them. A few came and jumped onto the bank beside you to grab at the bag in V\u2019s hands. The smile on his face hurts your heart; it\u2019s so genuine and wide as he tries to pet the ducks that you almost forget who he is,</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a little treat for them, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll survive,\u201d You assure him, half distracted by the ducklings swimming around with their mother duck. You find it so easy to talk to V, and the conversation progresses of its own accord. It eventually ends up revolving around him and his life choices,</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not a great life, and it\u2019s hardly sustainable when I lose my charm and my muscles,\u201d He teases, smile wide before falling into something more serious, \u201cBut I don\u2019t really have a choice now. There\u2019s some 10 year gap in my employment history, so I couldn\u2019t get a job without raising questions. I\u2019m stuck here, really,\u201d V sighs, but tries his best to smile at you to save you feeling too sorry for him,</p><p>\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t stuck here,\u201d You mope, handing over your last crust of bread to a shy duck who had hung back when the others charged over,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stuck!\u201d V protests, turning to you with excitement in his eyes, \u201cYou could do anything you want, go anywhere! If you asked Mr Kim nicely, he\u2019d probably let you travel around and get a job and have a life of your own. This is not something a big brother would choose for his little sister,\u201d He elaborates, hands moving wildly to emphasise his point,</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d probably make me take Jungkook with me,\u201d You fire back, eyebrow raised challengingly. You\u2019re not wrong. You couldn\u2019t even go and explore the grounds without some kind of chaperone. You had someone watch over you while you slept on the first night, bring you down to breakfast\u2026 you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been alone since you got here.</p><p>V tears you out of your thoughts with a scrunch of his nose, showing you that he doesn\u2019t even like Jungkook\u2019s name to be mentioned. You noticed that. When V came to take you down to dinner, and Jungkook got aggressive\u2026 they must have some kind of rivalry. Not that you blame V at all,</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling! Why do you hate him?\u201d You probe. There\u2019s got to be an interesting story there, since V doesn\u2019t seem like the type of person to dislike another so easily,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into detail, but I used to know Jungkook. I knew him quite a long time ago. He wasn\u2019t a good person back then and I don\u2019t believe that he is now,\u201d V explains, expression indecipherable as he watches the ducks squabble over the last piece of bread. You nod absent-mindedly, wondering what the specifics could be, when V asks you a similar question, \u201cWhat did he do to you? Apart from having the most mysterious vibe of the year, of course,\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t even find it within yourself to laugh at V\u2019s jab at the raven-haired man. The one who caused you so much happiness and pain. The one who comforted you and then abandoned you. You hadn\u2019t had any particularly harsh feelings before, but now you know that he lied about who he was. You don\u2019t even know if what he told you was true,</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if it\u2019s a sensitive subject. You can tell me to stop being so nosey, or you can blurt it out in a jumble of nonsense. Either way, nobody will ever know we discussed this at all,\u201d V assures you, and that breaks the wall. Tears well up in your eyes as you think back to that painful time.</p><p>When you moved to America, it became clear that your auntie was very much a career woman, and wouldn\u2019t be around much. That wasn\u2019t so bad, but it did mean that you were mostly left alone to deal with your grief. Apart from contact with Namjoon and Jimin - barely ever with Jin - you were closed off. A few weeks later though, a boy just a little older than you moved in next door. His name was Jayden.</p><p>You were desperate for someone to help, so you opened up to him, and he opened up to you. He was a good friend to you, until he suddenly moved out. You\u2019d brushed it off - Jayden had helped you through the worst bits anyway, so you were a little more capable of facing the world. And you did, until you came back here and you found out that Jayden wasn\u2019t even real, it was just the story made up by one sick man. He fed off of your grief for God only knows what reason.</p><p>The friend who helped you through the darkness wasn\u2019t even real,</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t cry,\u201d V coos, putting an arm around you to pull you into his chest, \u201cHe\u2019s not worth your tears, save them for someone who matters,\u201d You sniffle as you try to pull yourself together, desperate not to lose control of your emotions. If you start properly crying, you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ll ever stop. This new world is so painful, \u201cHave you told Jungkook how you feel? Or anyone?\u201d V asks, and you shake your head, pulling back to push your hair out of your face,</p><p>\u201cNo, he threatened me when I worked it out. I decided not to push it, and just go along with it,\u201d V nods slowly at your response, but his mind is set. He knows he told you this would be in complete confidence, but V has to tell Seokjin what he just found out. He doesn\u2019t want to betray your trust like that, but for your safety he has to tell Seokjin what\u2019s going on. If Jungkook is working for Suga, then Seokjin needs to know he has someone who works for Suga, but who\u2019s loyalty lies elsewhere. He wants to be Seokjin\u2019s inside man. </p><p>His mind is set now.</p><p>After a few more minutes sat by the pond (and several attempts from V to get you to jump in), V declares that there\u2019s one room he wouldn\u2019t forgive himself for not telling you about. And with that statement, he runs off towards the mansion, his light-hearted giggle trailing behind him,</p><p>\u201cV, this is amazing!\u201d You gasp in awe, when he leads you into some kind of cinema room. He explained that it\u2019s mainly used to show training videos, so you weren\u2019t expecting much. The screen is huge, and although the seats aren\u2019t the leathery heaven you find in cinemas, the seats are padded well and it looks comfortable. You can really see yourself watching movies curled up in a fluffy blanket here,</p><p>\u201cIf you want to, you can relax in here. I have to head up to briefing at 3pm and I don\u2019t want to be late. Will you be okay?\u201d V asks, and you smile in response as you mess around with the computer at the front of the room. You\u2019re absolutely going to download Netflix. You don\u2019t notice the way V\u2019s face flushes, or how he shuffles awkwardly. You don\u2019t notice that he\u2019s lying to you,</p><p>\u201cYeah, do you know if there are any fluffy blankets here? It\u2019d be nice to curl up under one,\u201d You wonder out loud, and V snorts in response,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re currently living in a mansion full of men who are content eating porridge for breakfast. You think they stock Disney films and cuddly pyjamas?\u201d He teases, and you blush in embarrassment. He\u2019s got a point, even if it does disappoint you. It would feel more homely with that personal touch, \u201cNo fear, V is here. I\u2019ll grab you a duvet from one of the unused bedrooms, and request at briefing that they throw some cash your way for some nice things,\u201d He assures you, and you thank him, slightly distracted as you log into Netflix.</p><p>V returns a few minutes later with one of the nicer duvets and a heat pack - he says they\u2019re mostly used for muscle injuries, but this mansion can be so cold. You very nearly throw yourself into his arms to thank him but think better of it when you see V\u2019s strained smile. It just breaks your heart, wondering if he\u2019s nervous for briefing. It hardly sounds fun.</p><p>While you choose what to watch, V slips away. He hates lying, but he doesn\u2019t want you to know that he\u2019s about to go to see your brother and tell him most of what you just confided in him. If it wasn\u2019t for your safety, he wouldn\u2019t dare! V knows he isn\u2019t a bad person.</p><p>He isn\u2019t a bad person. That\u2019s the mantra in his head as he explains to the guard by the security door that leads to Seokjin\u2019s office that he needs to speak with him. V only wants the best for people, even if it involves admitting that he\u2019s not been entirely truthful about his past.</p><p>Seokjin calls V in immediately, and he finds the tall man locking up a cabinet with old eyes on his face. When they face each other, V is sure that he sees a look of disgust flash across Jin\u2019s face but maybe it\u2019s a trick of the light. It\u2019s probably just the projection of V\u2019s inner turmoil,</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to speak with me?\u201d Jin prompts, keeping a distance from V. He came to the conclusion that V is one of Suga\u2019s inside men, and now here is in front of him. It\u2019s tempting fate, and Jin doesn\u2019t like it,</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I should tell you something. It\u2019s a little sensitive,\u201d V replies, voice lowered despite nobody being in their general vicinity. Jin sighs, anticipating his thoughts from earlier being confirmed. Just great. If V comes clean, Jin will have no choice but to dispose of him, regardless of how much you like him. He can\u2019t afford to ignore these things publicly. It\u2019ll send the wrong message, \u201cOh but first\u2026 I don\u2019t think Y/N is totally comfortable here. I think it would be a good idea to allow some money to buy homely things like fluffy blankets and her favourite snacks,\u201d V says first, not wanting to forget. Jin starts slightly at this,</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s fine,\u201d He says. That threw him off. He wasn\u2019t expecting it, but he quickly regains his composure. This isn\u2019t what V came to say, \u201cBefore you tell me your main point, let\u2019s move to the office two door down. It\u2019s soundproofed, and I don\u2019t want anyone overhearing us,\u201d Jin says, but that\u2019s not why. He learned from his mistakes. If he has to silence V, it can\u2019t be a spur of the moment thing like Jimin. It has to go unnoticed. For your sake,</p><p>\u201cI was sent here by Suga to spy on you and your sister, and see if I could gain any sensitive information,\u201d V says, and pauses, waiting for Seokjin to react. But, in true CEO style, Seokjin doesn\u2019t even flinch. When he notices that V is waiting for a response, he sighs,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already suspected as much. Is this all you have to tell me? You\u2019re not trying to kill me? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re even armed,\u201d Jin notes, eyebrows pulling together in a slight frown. This isn\u2019t making as much sense as he thought it would. At Seokjin\u2019s words, V takes a deep breath, ready to explain his proposal,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not armed. Actually, I wanted to offer my services to you. I could help you get the upper hand on Suga. I know about your investigation and I think I could help! I can\u2019t help him take you down, and I won\u2019t. Y/N relies on you, and she\u2019s too sweet and young. She lost her parents, and I refuse to let her lose her brother,\u201d V babbles, worried that Jin already knew that. What if he\u2019s already decided he doesn\u2019t want V\u2019s help? Then he has nothing! He\u2019ll have to leave the mafia completely, and like he told you earlier, he can\u2019t do that,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? How could you help me get the upper hand?\u201d Jin prompts, feeling his emotions rise. V mentioned the investigation. He does know about it, and that can\u2019t be good. He subtly shifts in his spot, feeling the revolver tucked into his pocket,</p><p>\u201cI could go back to Suga and tell him that I couldn\u2019t find anything out. I could feed you back information about what he plans to do and help you stop him from finding out how you\u2019re progressing. I just want to make up for my mistakes,\u201d He protests, voice falling to a whisper for his last stamen. But Jin still hears,</p><p>\u201cWhat mistakes?\u201d Jin barks, throwing caution and composure to the wind. If V says what Jin thinks he\u2019s about to say, it won\u2019t matter if the man sees him losing his temper. V shifts on his feet and looks at the floor, unable to meet Jin\u2019s eyes,</p><p>\u201cI was involved that night,\u201d He hisses, barely audible over the sound of his own thumping heart, \u201cJimin gave me access to the security network, and I shut the CCTV down. I killed the alarms and I gave the all clear for the killer to move in. I didn\u2019t mastermind it but\u2026 I managed all ground-level work,\u201d </p><p>That\u2019s it. There was a missing link. A gap in the pinboard that haunted Jin. How did the killer get in? Even with an inside man, even with Jimin right there to let them in, how did they bypass security? Turns out Jin was missing just one letter. V,</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the killer, V?\u201d Jin commands, voice shaking with breathlessness. He\u2019s so close he can almost taste it. His fingers twitch towards his pocket, but he tries desperately to remain neutral as they stand here discussing the murder of his parents,</p><p>\u201cJ-Hope,\u201d That\u2019s exactly what Jin wanted to hear. He has access to Hoseok,</p><p>\u201cHow often do you contact Suga?\u201d He questions, and if he hears what he wants to hear, he can take the next step. V\u2019s answer seals his fate,</p><p>\u201cI was told not to bother unless I uncovered something time sensitive. I haven\u2019t contacted him yet, but I can if you want me to. I just want to do right by you,\u201d V pleads, sensing the desperation of the situation. Jin doesn\u2019t care though. That\u2019s exactly what he needed to hear,</p><p>\u201cIs that all? Anything else to tell me?\u201d Jin can barely keep the growl out of his voice, and when V shakes his head, indicating that he\u2019s told him everything, Jin acts. He pulls the revolver out of his pocket with a sick smile and puts it to V\u2019s forehead. He ignores the wounded look of betrayal and pulls the trigger. You don\u2019t get anywhere being merciful in this business. As the shot rings in his ear and the lifeless form of V collapses backwards, Jin finds himself with a sad smile, \u201cFive,\u201d</p></p>",

His encounter with you has put him off his food first and foremost, and he finds himself in need of addressing some business. Jungkook. If he&rsquo;s mistreated you, and Jin finds his own trust misplaced, there will be hell to pay. You may not be particularly close with Jin anymore, but he still treasures you. He won&rsquo;t have some new recruit mess around with you.</p><p>Jungkook is familiar with the tactic that Jin&rsquo;s using on him. He wants to intimidate him, but Jin doesn&rsquo;t know that much about Jungkook. He&rsquo;s been subject to these kinds of tactics his entire life, and Jin is no different. It&rsquo;s not too difficult to maintain eye contact, making clear that he won&rsquo;t back down,</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been mistreating Y/N?&rdquo; Jin enquires, sitting forward and readjusting his suit jacket. He sorely misses the days when jeans were his daily attire. His aura is still filled with confidence though. It&rsquo;s part of the job - exuding confidence to the point of arrogance out of every pore,</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Is all Jungkook says. His eyes are hardened and trustworthy as they have been for a long time. His exterior is cool and collected, recognising that Jin will not be as friendly with him as he usually is. Well, not necessarily friendly. Just&hellip; not hostile. However, Jungkook&rsquo;s mind is rife with thoughts of you, the past you share and regret for ever going through with the job. How could he have ever lied to you?</p><p>&ldquo;Well, she must have meant something when she insisted that V is nicer to her. Why don&rsquo;t you give me some theories?&rdquo; Jin probes, and Jungkook doesn&rsquo;t even flinch, despite knowing exactly what your problem with him is. He lied to you; he pretended to be someone else and befriended you. He didn&rsquo;t realise at the time how much he might have hurt you by doing so,</p><p>&ldquo;I was a little aggressive on that first night when V came to bring her for dinner, but that&rsquo;s all I can think of. Maybe she just gets an odd vibe from me, and is trusting that,&rdquo; Jungkook suggests, hating every word. Why is he so good at this? He doesn&rsquo;t even have to try to manipulate well. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a talent,</p><p>&ldquo;That may be true. You may know by now that I have a lot of faith in you, Jungkook, and that faith is hard to come by in this line of work. If you don&rsquo;t like or trust V, then I&rsquo;ll assume you have a good reason. Care to share it?&rdquo;</p><p>Does Jungkook care to share it? What&rsquo;s the information worth really? He&rsquo;s not sure it&rsquo;ll make much of a difference to things at the moment, and if V finds out that Jungkook&rsquo;s been talking, it could only lead to more trouble for the raven-haired boy. Right now, what he knows wouldn&rsquo;t benefit him to share, so there&rsquo;s no point. Best wait for the right moment,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s sensitive information, and I couldn&rsquo;t tell you one thing without telling you it all,&rdquo; Jungkook says tactfully, and Jin nods carefully. He has no choice but to allow Jungkook this small victory. Besides, he&rsquo;ll find out eventually. You can&rsquo;t keep anything from the head of the biggest gang in Korea, </p><p>&ldquo;I simply knew V before I came here, and I&rsquo;m not sure if his intentions are quite as pure as they seem,&rdquo; Oh. That&rsquo;s interesting. But Jin can&rsquo;t wait around to pick it apart right now; he needs to be on his own for that.</p><p>After dismissing Jungkook, Jin makes his way up the main office, refusing to speak with anyone who asks for his time on the way there. That comment from Jungkook means something, and it fits into the maze Jin is wandering through.</p><p>Jin thinks of Jimin. He thinks of Jimin and how he could&rsquo;ve gone unnoticed as a double agent for so long. How did he miss it? Was it blind trust? Was it a mistake? Or was it that Jin was so desperate for friendship and support that he was willing to buy anything? He never wanted to be a murderer. Like every young boy, Jin wanted to be an astronaut. A footballer. A chef. He wanted to be good, but now, seeing the blood of his friend on his hands, blood that will never wash off, Jin can&rsquo;t believe that he is. When he started his investigation into his parent&rsquo;s murder, he never thought it would lead him down this path of violence and ill-placed trust.</p><p>It&rsquo;s when Jin sits on the back of desk, exhaling heavily that he spots something. Just something small, tucked away unassumingly beneath the leather couch. There shouldn&rsquo;t be things in this office that Jin doesn&rsquo;t know about, so it both intrigues him and terrifies him in equal parts.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a camera. A small, compact, digital one. The kind you can buy in a computer store for a low price. Jin recognises it as easy to operate, with a good image quality. Perfect for close-quarters surveillance&hellip; it must be Jimin&rsquo;s. What Jin holds in his hands - his bloodied, murderous hands - is all the proof that could verify or destroy the decision to murder his best friend. He physically shakes as he switches it on, desperate to know but terrified about what it could show him.</p><p>The pinboard - the one that Jin uses to track the progress of his investigation. It really is Jimin&rsquo;s camera. Only him, Namjoon and Jimin have the key to unlock it. Short of breath, Jin races to open the cabinet and compare the images to the evidence in front of him. There are barely any new additions. It&rsquo;s recent. Jimin must have been feeding this back to Suga, tracking every step Jin took.</p><p>Suga knows about the investigation.</p><p>He knows exactly what Jin does. How close he is, what he wants to find out next, exactly how he plans to do so. The only thing his rival doesn&rsquo;t know is the endgame. Only Jin and Namjoon know that. The only record of it is kept private, locked in the most secure safe in this mansion. Jin can breathe again, knowing that he may be disadvantaged momentarily, he still has that. Suga doesn&rsquo;t know for sure what he plans to do with the information he&rsquo;s gathering.</p><p>However, this revelation does lead to new issues. Jin sets the camera down, momentarily forgetting it as the cogs in his brain whirr. He&rsquo;s good at his job for a reason. Thinking is what Jin&rsquo;s good at.</p><p>If Jimin was sent here to monitor Jin as an inside man, there&rsquo;s no way that Suga doesn&rsquo;t know about his death. All of Jin&rsquo;s undercover workers check in regularly in some way, so there&rsquo;s no way that Suga doesn&rsquo;t have sustained contact with the man. Especially if he was reporting back with potentially time sensitive information, Jin is sure that Suga knows. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before there&rsquo;s another person integrated into the business.</p><p>One way to solve that - no more new recruits. But if Suga knew Jin was close to the whole truth, he probably increased surveillance a few weeks ago. At least, that&rsquo;s what Jin would do. He&rsquo;s had to come to accept that he thinks like Suga does.</p><p>By following the same line of logic, that would single out the only new people in a position of power. V and Jungkook. Jungkook just said that he used to know V, and that he may not be trustworthy. That would imply that they perhaps trained with Suga, and Jungkook left shortly after. Maybe he ended up here by coincidence, and it&rsquo;s V that&rsquo;s the traitor. Maybe it&rsquo;s the other way round.</p><p>Either way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much. Neither of them gets particularly sensitive information or access codes, and they&rsquo;re good to have around for your sake. Particularly V. So with that in mind, Jin makes the decision to do nothing. If nobody comes to the same conclusion and challenges his integrity, that Jin can safely bide his time. Besides, killing off all of Suga&rsquo;s spies would only clue him in that Jin knows what he&rsquo;s up to. By leaving things as they are, he regains the upper hand that he unknowingly lost. Suga probably still thinks it&rsquo;s safe to send his precious Hope here, no doubt. With at least some armed spies remaining, what could go wrong?</p><p>Kim Seokjin. That&rsquo;s what.</p><p>~~~</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; You murmur to V as he hands you a slice of bread. He genuinely went to the kitchen and stole half a loaf of bread, and you can&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re surprised. V really is the kind of man to go and steal you bread if you want it, and show you all the best places in the mansion. Although it&rsquo;s a huge place, you&rsquo;re finding it easier and easier to find your way round. V&rsquo;s already made the joke that you should leave bread crumbs in future so you don&rsquo;t get lost.</p><p>As exciting as the mansion is - genuinely, it&rsquo;s the kind you would only usually get to see a portion of on National History tours - you eventually get a little sick of being cooped up. With that in mind, you want to start seeing some more of the landscape. It&rsquo;s largely just well-kept grass, but there are some ponds and small flowerbeds to look at. V is more than happy to take you to the duck pond,</p><p>&ldquo;You know, bread is actually pretty bad for ducks,&rdquo; He notes when you both start feeding them. A few came and jumped onto the bank beside you to grab at the bag in V&rsquo;s hands. The smile on his face hurts your heart; it&rsquo;s so genuine and wide as he tries to pet the ducks that you almost forget who he is,</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little treat for them, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll survive,&rdquo; You assure him, half distracted by the ducklings swimming around with their mother duck. You find it so easy to talk to V, and the conversation progresses of its own accord. It eventually ends up revolving around him and his life choices,</p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not a great life, and it&rsquo;s hardly sustainable when I lose my charm and my muscles,&rdquo; He teases, smile wide before falling into something more serious, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t really have a choice now. There&rsquo;s some 10 year gap in my employment history, so I couldn&rsquo;t get a job without raising questions. I&rsquo;m stuck here, really,&rdquo; V sighs, but tries his best to smile at you to save you feeling too sorry for him,</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I wasn&rsquo;t stuck here,&rdquo; You mope, handing over your last crust of bread to a shy duck who had hung back when the others charged over,</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stuck!&rdquo; V protests, turning to you with excitement in his eyes, &ldquo;You could do anything you want, go anywhere! If you asked Mr Kim nicely, he&rsquo;d probably let you travel around and get a job and have a life of your own. This is not something a big brother would choose for his little sister,&rdquo; He elaborates, hands moving wildly to emphasise his point,</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d probably make me take Jungkook with me,&rdquo; You fire back, eyebrow raised challengingly. You&rsquo;re not wrong. You couldn&rsquo;t even go and explore the grounds without some kind of chaperone. You had someone watch over you while you slept on the first night, bring you down to breakfast&hellip; you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve been alone since you got here.</p><p>V tears you out of your thoughts with a scrunch of his nose, showing you that he doesn&rsquo;t even like Jungkook&rsquo;s name to be mentioned. You noticed that. When V came to take you down to dinner, and Jungkook got aggressive&hellip; they must have some kind of rivalry. Not that you blame V at all,</p><p>&ldquo;I know that feeling! Why do you hate him?&rdquo; You probe. There&rsquo;s got to be an interesting story there, since V doesn&rsquo;t seem like the type of person to dislike another so easily,</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go into detail, but I used to know Jungkook. I knew him quite a long time ago. He wasn&rsquo;t a good person back then and I don&rsquo;t believe that he is now,&rdquo; V explains, expression indecipherable as he watches the ducks squabble over the last piece of bread. You nod absent-mindedly, wondering what the specifics could be, when V asks you a similar question, &ldquo;What did he do to you? Apart from having the most mysterious vibe of the year, of course,&rdquo;</p><p>You can&rsquo;t even find it within yourself to laugh at V&rsquo;s jab at the raven-haired man. The one who caused you so much happiness and pain. The one who comforted you and then abandoned you. You hadn&rsquo;t had any particularly harsh feelings before, but now you know that he lied about who he was. You don&rsquo;t even know if what he told you was true,</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me if it&rsquo;s a sensitive subject. You can tell me to stop being so nosey, or you can blurt it out in a jumble of nonsense. Either way, nobody will ever know we discussed this at all,&rdquo; V assures you, and that breaks the wall. Tears well up in your eyes as you think back to that painful time.</p><p>When you moved to America, it became clear that your auntie was very much a career woman, and wouldn&rsquo;t be around much. That wasn&rsquo;t so bad, but it did mean that you were mostly left alone to deal with your grief. Apart from contact with Namjoon and Jimin - barely ever with Jin - you were closed off. A few weeks later though, a boy just a little older than you moved in next door. His name was Jayden.</p><p>You were desperate for someone to help, so you opened up to him, and he opened up to you. He was a good friend to you, until he suddenly moved out. You&rsquo;d brushed it off - Jayden had helped you through the worst bits anyway, so you were a little more capable of facing the world. And you did, until you came back here and you found out that Jayden wasn&rsquo;t even real, it was just the story made up by one sick man. He fed off of your grief for God only knows what reason.</p><p>The friend who helped you through the darkness wasn&rsquo;t even real,</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; V coos, putting an arm around you to pull you into his chest, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth your tears, save them for someone who matters,&rdquo; You sniffle as you try to pull yourself together, desperate not to lose control of your emotions. If you start properly crying, you&rsquo;re not sure if you&rsquo;ll ever stop. This new world is so painful, &ldquo;Have you told Jungkook how you feel? Or anyone?&rdquo; V asks, and you shake your head, pulling back to push your hair out of your face,</p><p>&ldquo;No, he threatened me when I worked it out. I decided not to push it, and just go along with it,&rdquo; V nods slowly at your response, but his mind is set. He knows he told you this would be in complete confidence, but V has to tell Seokjin what he just found out. He doesn&rsquo;t want to betray your trust like that, but for your safety he has to tell Seokjin what&rsquo;s going on. If Jungkook is working for Suga, then Seokjin needs to know he has someone who works for Suga, but who&rsquo;s loyalty lies elsewhere. He wants to be Seokjin&rsquo;s inside man. </p><p>His mind is set now.</p><p>After a few more minutes sat by the pond (and several attempts from V to get you to jump in), V declares that there&rsquo;s one room he wouldn&rsquo;t forgive himself for not telling you about. And with that statement, he runs off towards the mansion, his light-hearted giggle trailing behind him,</p><p>&ldquo;V, this is amazing!&rdquo; You gasp in awe, when he leads you into some kind of cinema room. He explained that it&rsquo;s mainly used to show training videos, so you weren&rsquo;t expecting much. The screen is huge, and although the seats aren&rsquo;t the leathery heaven you find in cinemas, the seats are padded well and it looks comfortable. You can really see yourself watching movies curled up in a fluffy blanket here,</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to, you can relax in here. I have to head up to briefing at 3pm and I don&rsquo;t want to be late. Will you be okay?&rdquo; V asks, and you smile in response as you mess around with the computer at the front of the room. You&rsquo;re absolutely going to download Netflix. You don&rsquo;t notice the way V&rsquo;s face flushes, or how he shuffles awkwardly. You don&rsquo;t notice that he&rsquo;s lying to you,</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, do you know if there are any fluffy blankets here? It&rsquo;d be nice to curl up under one,&rdquo; You wonder out loud, and V snorts in response,</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re currently living in a mansion full of men who are content eating porridge for breakfast. You think they stock Disney films and cuddly pyjamas?&rdquo; He teases, and you blush in embarrassment. He&rsquo;s got a point, even if it does disappoint you. It would feel more homely with that personal touch, &ldquo;No fear, V is here. I&rsquo;ll grab you a duvet from one of the unused bedrooms, and request at briefing that they throw some cash your way for some nice things,&rdquo; He assures you, and you thank him, slightly distracted as you log into Netflix.</p><p>V returns a few minutes later with one of the nicer duvets and a heat pack - he says they&rsquo;re mostly used for muscle injuries, but this mansion can be so cold. You very nearly throw yourself into his arms to thank him but think better of it when you see V&rsquo;s strained smile. It just breaks your heart, wondering if he&rsquo;s nervous for briefing. It hardly sounds fun.</p><p>While you choose what to watch, V slips away. He hates lying, but he doesn&rsquo;t want you to know that he&rsquo;s about to go to see your brother and tell him most of what you just confided in him. If it wasn&rsquo;t for your safety, he wouldn&rsquo;t dare! V knows he isn&rsquo;t a bad person.</p><p>He isn&rsquo;t a bad person. That&rsquo;s the mantra in his head as he explains to the guard by the security door that leads to Seokjin&rsquo;s office that he needs to speak with him. V only wants the best for people, even if it involves admitting that he&rsquo;s not been entirely truthful about his past.</p><p>Seokjin calls V in immediately, and he finds the tall man locking up a cabinet with old eyes on his face. When they face each other, V is sure that he sees a look of disgust flash across Jin&rsquo;s face but maybe it&rsquo;s a trick of the light. It&rsquo;s probably just the projection of V&rsquo;s inner turmoil,</p><p>&ldquo;You wanted to speak with me?&rdquo; Jin prompts, keeping a distance from V. He came to the conclusion that V is one of Suga&rsquo;s inside men, and now here is in front of him. It&rsquo;s tempting fate, and Jin doesn&rsquo;t like it,</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I should tell you something. It&rsquo;s a little sensitive,&rdquo; V replies, voice lowered despite nobody being in their general vicinity. Jin sighs, anticipating his thoughts from earlier being confirmed. Just great. If V comes clean, Jin will have no choice but to dispose of him, regardless of how much you like him. He can&rsquo;t afford to ignore these things publicly. It&rsquo;ll send the wrong message, &ldquo;Oh but first&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think Y/N is totally comfortable here. I think it would be a good idea to allow some money to buy homely things like fluffy blankets and her favourite snacks,&rdquo; V says first, not wanting to forget. Jin starts slightly at this,</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; He says. That threw him off. He wasn&rsquo;t expecting it, but he quickly regains his composure. This isn&rsquo;t what V came to say, &ldquo;Before you tell me your main point, let&rsquo;s move to the office two door down. It&rsquo;s soundproofed, and I don&rsquo;t want anyone overhearing us,&rdquo; Jin says, but that&rsquo;s not why. He learned from his mistakes. If he has to silence V, it can&rsquo;t be a spur of the moment thing like Jimin. It has to go unnoticed. For your sake,</p><p>&ldquo;I was sent here by Suga to spy on you and your sister, and see if I could gain any sensitive information,&rdquo; V says, and pauses, waiting for Seokjin to react. But, in true CEO style, Seokjin doesn&rsquo;t even flinch. When he notices that V is waiting for a response, he sighs,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d already suspected as much. Is this all you have to tell me? You&rsquo;re not trying to kill me? I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re even armed,&rdquo; Jin notes, eyebrows pulling together in a slight frown. This isn&rsquo;t making as much sense as he thought it would. At Seokjin&rsquo;s words, V takes a deep breath, ready to explain his proposal,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not armed. Actually, I wanted to offer my services to you. I could help you get the upper hand on Suga. I know about your investigation and I think I could help! I can&rsquo;t help him take you down, and I won&rsquo;t. Y/N relies on you, and she&rsquo;s too sweet and young. She lost her parents, and I refuse to let her lose her brother,&rdquo; V babbles, worried that Jin already knew that. What if he&rsquo;s already decided he doesn&rsquo;t want V&rsquo;s help? Then he has nothing! He&rsquo;ll have to leave the mafia completely, and like he told you earlier, he can&rsquo;t do that,</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? How could you help me get the upper hand?&rdquo; Jin prompts, feeling his emotions rise. V mentioned the investigation. He does know about it, and that can&rsquo;t be good. He subtly shifts in his spot, feeling the revolver tucked into his pocket,</p><p>&ldquo;I could go back to Suga and tell him that I couldn&rsquo;t find anything out. I could feed you back information about what he plans to do and help you stop him from finding out how you&rsquo;re progressing. I just want to make up for my mistakes,&rdquo; He protests, voice falling to a whisper for his last stamen. But Jin still hears,</p><p>&ldquo;What mistakes?&rdquo; Jin barks, throwing caution and composure to the wind. If V says what Jin thinks he&rsquo;s about to say, it won&rsquo;t matter if the man sees him losing his temper. V shifts on his feet and looks at the floor, unable to meet Jin&rsquo;s eyes,</p><p>&ldquo;I was involved that night,&rdquo; He hisses, barely audible over the sound of his own thumping heart, &ldquo;Jimin gave me access to the security network, and I shut the CCTV down. I killed the alarms and I gave the all clear for the killer to move in. I didn&rsquo;t mastermind it but&hellip; I managed all ground-level work,&rdquo; </p><p>That&rsquo;s it. There was a missing link. A gap in the pinboard that haunted Jin. How did the killer get in? Even with an inside man, even with Jimin right there to let them in, how did they bypass security? Turns out Jin was missing just one letter. V,</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the killer, V?&rdquo; Jin commands, voice shaking with breathlessness. He&rsquo;s so close he can almost taste it. His fingers twitch towards his pocket, but he tries desperately to remain neutral as they stand here discussing the murder of his parents,</p><p>&ldquo;J-Hope,&rdquo; That&rsquo;s exactly what Jin wanted to hear. He has access to Hoseok,</p><p>&ldquo;How often do you contact Suga?&rdquo; He questions, and if he hears what he wants to hear, he can take the next step. V&rsquo;s answer seals his fate,</p><p>&ldquo;I was told not to bother unless I uncovered something time sensitive. I haven&rsquo;t contacted him yet, but I can if you want me to. I just want to do right by you,&rdquo; V pleads, sensing the desperation of the situation. Jin doesn&rsquo;t care though. That&rsquo;s exactly what he needed to hear,</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all? Anything else to tell me?&rdquo; Jin can barely keep the growl out of his voice, and when V shakes his head, indicating that he&rsquo;s told him everything, Jin acts. He pulls the revolver out of his pocket with a sick smile and puts it to V&rsquo;s forehead. He ignores the wounded look of betrayal and pulls the trigger. You don&rsquo;t get anywhere being merciful in this business. As the shot rings in his ear and the lifeless form of V collapses backwards, Jin finds himself with a sad smile, &ldquo;Five,&rdquo;</p></p>",
