                "content": "<p><h1>Lost way ch.6</h1><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>I could feel the breeze in my face while it made my Black long curly hair that was in a ponytail flow. My cap covering the sun from hitting my face. My cup of tea keeping me warm. I could hear the busy streets as I was sitting outside keeping watch for any suspious cars or activity. </p><p>&ldquo; you guys see that nice Red Range Rover over there. From what I can tell it seems to be bullet proof. You know I keep telling Stark to let me use one of his cars but he doesn&rsquo;t let me. Shame.&rdquo; I say through the earpiece while I take a sip of my tea. </p><p>&ldquo; it being bullet proof means private security, which means more guns which means more headaches for somebody probably us.&rdquo; Natasha said. </p><p>&ldquo; it&rsquo;s definitely us.&rdquo;  I said. </p><p>&ldquo; you know I can move things with my mind right?&rdquo; Wanda said. </p><p>&ldquo; so can I.&rdquo; I pitched in. </p><p>&ldquo; looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; anybody tell you that you&rsquo;re a bit paranoid.&rdquo; Sam said to Natasha. I took another sip of my tea trying to laugh at his comment. </p><p>&ldquo; not to my face why someone say something?&rdquo; Natasha answered sarcastically. </p><p>&ldquo; eyes on target folks it&rsquo;s the best lead we&rsquo;ve got in past six months I don&rsquo;t want to lose him.&rdquo; Steve said. </p><p>After joining the avengers I started talking to them getting to know them. Ive gotten close with all of them. Espically with Steve. Steve and me were closer. A couple months after joining we started talking as more than friends. We had feelings for eachother. And everyone in the compound knew. Especially Natasha. She would constantly tease me about it. Steve and I have been taking things slow. It was adorable him trying. I loved it. Theirs whole side of him I never I thought I&rsquo;ll see. He always seemed so private about his things and his emotions. But not to me. After we got to know eachother more and more about our feelings towards eachother he became more open. He wouldn&rsquo;t say everything but he would say enough. He became very protective as well. Something I appreciated sometimes. </p><p>- </p><p>I climbed on my motorcycle and headed towards the building where the truck had crashed into. I hated not being able to fly in times like these. It would be so much faster if I could. Natasha and I were side by side in our motorcycle. I looked over at her and smiled before going faster. Once I got there I jumped out of the motorcycle letting it hit one of the many armed guys. When they saw me they tried shooting at me. But I duplicated myself tricking them and confusing them. When I was doing that I made them feel enough pain for them to get knocked out. I then saw Nat come by me jumping out of her motorcycle. She attacked them using her fighting skills. </p><p>&ldquo; one coming towards you.&rdquo; She huffed as she kicked him my way. I used my telekinesis and sent flying across making him hit a wall and knocking him out. As I was about to turn I felt someone hit me hard on the side of the head. I struggled to get up. The pounding headache now forming. When I got up I heard an explosion that came from a truck. I ran over and saw Natasha on the ground coughing the smoke out. I ran over to her and helped her get up. </p><p>&ldquo; you okay?&rdquo; I asked her concerned. She nodded before coughing again. We got on our motorcycles once we saw a truck leave. </p><p>&ldquo; I got four they&rsquo;re splitting up.&rdquo; Sam told us through my earpiece. </p><p>&ldquo; max and I got the two on the left.&rdquo; Natasha responded. We jumped off our bikes and jumped on the hood of the cars that blocked our path. We jumped off and ran after the two men. I was running behind Natasha. She made the running easier for me. Because she was clearing the path of any people wondering in between. I was running i felt myself get pushed to the ground. I got up and the guy had the pointing at me. I glared at him with a small smirk playing on lips. He fell onto his knees as he yelled in pain. He dropped the gun to the ground. I ran towards him and then kicked him in the chest making him go across to the far side. I kicked the gun out of the way before going to get him. He was fast though because he got up and smacked across the face. </p><p>&ldquo; that wasn&rsquo;t nice at all&rdquo; I said to him before punching him in the face. He got my arm and flipped me over. He ran towards the gun and pointed it at Natasha. But Natasha was quick and pointer her gun at him. I got up and walked behind. I then made him feel pain which caused him to Knock out. </p><p>&ldquo; drop it or I&rsquo;ll drop this.&rdquo; The other guy said holding the vile. Natasha then pointed her gun at him. But then Sams little robot thing shot him. Making him drop the vile. Natasha ran and caught it. </p><p>&ldquo; thanks Sam.&rdquo; Natasha said through the earpiece. </p><p>&ldquo; yea thanks Sam.&rdquo; I said as well. </p><p>&ldquo; don&rsquo;t thank me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m not thanking that thing.&rdquo;Natasha said looking at the little robot. </p><p>&ldquo; yea me neither.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; his name is red wing!
