I also think her distrust of Dany is logical she and Jon fought hard to regain the North and now a foreign queen is asking her to pledge fealty",
        "answer": "<p>yeah her distrust is completely understandable, definitely. she has every right to be distraustful given her history with rulers. And Sansa is most definitely smart enough to manipulate Tyrion, maybe Sansa is even the one to find out about Tyrion\u2019s betrayal of Dany by getting him to full and completely trust her with every fibre of his being. And she won\u2019t be happy he\u2019s working with cersei so I think we see where that\u2019ll go.
