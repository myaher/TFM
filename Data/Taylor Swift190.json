Don\u2019t make any love or whatever decisions right now, the Venus bitch is gonna be on the retro, everything will go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon\u201d I said, \u201cDo you believe this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s serious, the cycle is happening every 1,5 years but this time after 8 years it\u2019s on this scorpion retro that gonna last at least for 6 weeks and the past will reassure and the past mistakes and pains will rise again, people that gone will come again, and whatever decision you wanna take will go terribly bad\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, a-ha, okay.\u201d I replied, not to continue this any longer, \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t know I was gonna need to add a new chapter to this writing series that was supposed to be done long ago, didn\u2019t realize we were about to enter the cycle, then I was already beginning doing things that caused me disappointments before or, another friend read from a coffee cup saying \u201cYou may love someone, or choose not to, it\u2019s just so blur\u201d, only a day before, I met that someone.</p><p><b>The Hope</b></p><p>Right time, weird place, with right and so wrong person in many ways, I met that someone. He still has no clue though, later on I was remembering I in fact saw him somewhere exactly a year ago, liked him in secret and he didn\u2019t see me. This time around, it was him to write me first, offering me a trick or treat, while my caution was already bending down across his cool and handsome face.</p><p>He was partly honest with what he&rsquo;s expecting for, however didn&rsquo;t hope at all that was gonna meet someone he could actually talk. But I didn&rsquo;t know either what I was expecting, other than it was not to able to have stories as it before. </p><p>So we talked. And he told. Told so much that I was wondering if he ever told these stories anyone with these details, this quickly, pouring down his feelings into my hands to keep them safe. So that he could have someone by his side, been understood at last then again by someone he was so excited to meet. It must be amazing and new, filling him with dreams and expectations, that things gonna be changing now, he&rsquo;s not alone now, he&rsquo;s in love now.</p><p>Hasn&rsquo;t he ever seen what&rsquo;s missing here? Or at least feel?</p><p>He kept asking me what I was thinking cos I was losing my train of thoughts as in my usual mood, even I thought I was giving away too much. At least at first he tried to solve the girl who solves him, though I was thinking oh baby, people always tell me their stories, even the most private ones, only if they feel I&rsquo;m listening. Does he remember I&rsquo;m telling him?</p><p>But I don&rsquo;t wanna listen everyone, y'know, I&rsquo;m choosing to. Only I had the slightest sense of been broken, and not being able to come out of it, or still have the need to share so them to understand, when even they&rsquo;re not aware they need it.</p><p>Then I could sense it for myself, solve and gave them back in definable words, in other meaning <i>touching</i> them. I should be thankful for the people that truly love me love me not for I&rsquo;m making them feel okay and understood, but simply love me. </p><p>I listened him because he was damn good looking, had the soul and eye of an artist, could almost be my Robert Mapplethorpe, was really kind and making dinners for me.</p><p>I continued to listen him because I wanted to experience the share of caring, with a man I could also be friend.</p><p>Because he has no clue, but in the beginning of this year, I was kind of dating his worse version for a man but way better as a lover. I had tried but couldn&rsquo;t find a way to truly communicate with him, didn&rsquo;t want to meet him with my family nor friends, but wished for someone I could, thence Universe steps in.</p><p><b>The Truth</b></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking too much.&rdquo; once again my friends told me, but it is not something I can help. However, &ldquo;Maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t be this hard, whether you have doubts, it must be true. Maybe even you shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking this much.&rdquo; was something new. Naz\u0131m Hikmet tells the heart of the truly loving&rsquo;s, wins the war of staying over going away. The mind of mine that never stops, would win the war, even I wished to choose the love.</p><p>Because we were seeing each other too much, me making good old mistakes all over again, I began to realize too soon that he asked me less and less what I was thinking. I began to see it was meaningless to wait any messages, though very weirdly I was not that sad or miserable. It was oddly, fastly fading away. The cracks and breaks you had to learn mending strengths you before you become aware of it as parts of growing up. Even while it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t miss it, it\u2019s merely being in love with love. <i>She is not the cool woman I desire to see through the lenses, I am not the Robert she dreams.</i> Did he see this before me? Probably, because he was clever enough not to getting to know me through my writings. Maybe he saw what was missing in his initial feelings and it just didn\u2019t fit in. Maybe I realized we are both lazy and unstable, lost in our thoughts to go up and make a change.</p><p>I blame Erich Fromm, JK Rowling, Melis Dani\u015fmend, John Lennon and Taylor Swift* for making me think about love this much. </p><p>What they taught me in common, combining my own philosophy is that when you\u2019re old enough it\u2019s your responsibility to take control of your own life, not your parents, not your country, no one. Your responsibility to know yourself and trying to reach there, it\u2019s making the decision and the road that counts. Only then, you could truly love yourself, at least make an effort to make peace with yourself, and the others would mean less. Even the ones who love and care about you, even you should consider what they think of you. You should accept your parents as they are, stop being sorry for who you are. Then you won\u2019t need someone to love or support you, for you to fill your missing parts.</p><p>Well, I wish it would be as easy as writing to make it happen. </p><p>You can choose loving someone, cos you need it, alongside the way it could help loving yourself back. It\u2019s just more pleasant like Lennon said.</p><p>Or you simply don\u2019t.</p><p>And what I\u2019ve learned from these past years is, it\u2019s all okay, we all experience the both sides.</p><p><i>Why</i> do you live all these is a good question if you don\u2019t ask it as a complaint. Is it because of Venus the bitch? Universe showing you old problems in new forms so you to finally solve them? Instagram posts you hate in jealousy? </p><p>The last one definitely finds its own way somehow. But don\u2019t deny it all comes back to you. No you can\u2019t control everything, yes they manipulate us even within our deepest actions, and there\u2019re endless variables inside this equation that reaches the results we can\u2019t dream, but you\u2019re not the center of any universe, you\u2019re part of it. So it\u2019s only natural you\u2019re evolving together, you can\u2019t expect controlling it all over. You should welcome the surprises, bad or good, by taking risks. And work so hard so you can have a few lucky chances.\u00a0</p><p>Making the same mistakes takes me similar results, I can\u2019t claim it\u2019s the Venus or the Universe.</p><p>As in a dinner we were sharing together there was nothing to talk, out of blue Freud made us realize, or it was just me realizing for the first time that, Universe doesn\u2019t bring you old problems in new shapes, you were never in peace with your actions so you lead the way to the old mistaken routs, to see if you can solve it, that it was not your mistake but others\u2019. Well it\u2019s not, some routs are closed by\u00a0circumstances, or you\u2019re not facing the truths. Or in my case, I began to assume the odd and quick way is also normal. I\u2019m taking my experience after all, I\u2019ll always be unstable and messy, though don\u2019t want fake games no longer as my reality.</p><p><i>*Erich Fromm - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikizeroo.net%2Findex.php%3Fq%3DaHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvVGhlX0FydF9vZl9Mb3Zpbmc&amp;t=YzI4NjM5NjhlMTYwMDM4YTVkMjE3YmQwMTQ2NWI1NTM1OWRiZTdmYyxhOGU0NWQ5YTZlNjIwZDNhODdhNGI4ZmU1N2ZlMjNlOGYyNTk0OTA4\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Loving</a>, Lennon - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fquotes%2F1089621-they-made-us-believe-that-each-one-of-us-is&amp;t=YjA1MWJlNjRiNjk2NzlkZmRhZTVhMWM1ODgxZmMyYWFlMDNlOTQwOCw3ZTVkYzYzMWNlMTQ5N2NjMDhlYmE5MjU0MWJmYmRmNjVlYzg1NDVl\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> quote, JKR - especially <a href=\"http://bikarakoydegil.tumblr.com/post/146227808702/jk-rowling-2008-harvard-mezunlar%C4%B1-diploma\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> and <a href=\"http://bikarakoydegil.tumblr.com/post/146227816582/jk-rowling-2008-harvard-mezunlar%C4%B1-diploma\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>, Melis - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DkRysKBdB0fs&amp;t=YTk3MTZiZmNlNDVmZDk4ZGEyOWYyZjgxZWY5MmU3ZTg3Mjk0NzliOCxhNzNlOTk1NTlmNWI0NzEyMTk5ZDM0MDA0ZTcwN2Q4MzU2OWJmMmI2\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>, Taylor - probably every single song she\u2019s written on her last 2 albums</i></p><p><i>\n\n<i>\n\n<i>(<a href=\"http://bikarakoydegil.tumblr.com/post/170877301667/love-a-laserquest\" target=\"_blank\">Ch.

Or at least feel?</p><p>He kept asking me what I was thinking cos I was losing my train of thoughts as in my usual mood, even I thought I was giving away too much. At least at first he tried to solve the girl who solves him, though I was thinking oh baby, people always tell me their stories, even the most private ones, only if they feel I\u2019m listening. Does he remember I\u2019m telling him?</p><p>But I don\u2019t wanna listen everyone, y'know, I\u2019m choosing to. Only I had the slightest sense of been broken, and not being able to come out of it, or still have the need to share so them to understand, when even they\u2019re not aware they need it.</p><p>Then I could sense it for myself, solve and gave them back in definable words, in other meaning <i>touching</i> them. I should be thankful for the people that truly love me love me not for I\u2019m making them feel okay and understood, but simply love me. </p><p>I listened him because he was damn good looking, had the soul and eye of an artist, could almost be my Robert Mapplethorpe, was really kind and making dinners for me.</p><p>I continued to listen him because I wanted to experience the share of caring, with a man I could also be friend.</p><p>Because he has no clue, but in the beginning of this year, I was kind of dating his worse version for a man but way better as a lover. I had tried but couldn\u2019t find a way to truly communicate with him, didn\u2019t want to meet him with my family nor friends, but wished for someone I could, thence Universe steps in.</p><p><b>The Truth</b></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much.\u201d once again my friends told me, but it is not something I can help. However, \u201cMaybe it shouldn\u2019t be this hard, whether you have doubts, it must be true. Maybe even you shouldn\u2019t be thinking this much.\u201d was something new. Naz\u0131m Hikmet tells the heart of the truly loving\u2019s, wins the war of staying over going away. The mind of mine that never stops, would win the war, even I wished to choose the love.</p><p>Because we were seeing each other too much, me making good old mistakes all over again, I began to realize too soon that he asked me less and less what I was thinking. I began to see it was meaningless to wait any messages, though very weirdly I was not that sad or miserable. It was oddly, fastly fading away. The cracks and breaks you had to learn mending strengths you before you become aware of it as parts of growing up. Even while it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t miss it, it\u2019s merely being in love with love. <i>She is not the cool woman I desire to see through the lenses, I am not the Robert she dreams.</i> Did he see this before me? Probably, because he was clever enough not to getting to know me through my writings. Maybe he saw what was missing in his initial feelings and it just didn\u2019t fit in. Maybe I realized we are both lazy and unstable, lost in our thoughts to go up and make a change.</p><p>I blame Erich Fromm, JK Rowling, Melis Dani\u015fmend, John Lennon and Taylor Swift* for making me think about love this much. </p><p>What they taught me in common, combining my own philosophy is that when you\u2019re old enough it\u2019s your responsibility to take control of your own life, not your parents, not your country, no one. Your responsibility to know yourself and trying to reach there, it\u2019s making the decision and the road that counts. Only then, you could truly love yourself, at least make an effort to make peace with yourself, and the others would mean less. Even the ones who love and care about you, even you should consider what they think of you. You should accept your parents as they are, stop being sorry for who you are. Then you won\u2019t need someone to love or support you, for you to fill your missing parts.</p><p>Well, I wish it would be as easy as writing to make it happen. </p><p>You can choose loving someone, cos you need it, alongside the way it could help loving yourself back. It\u2019s just more pleasant like Lennon said.</p><p>Or you simply don\u2019t.</p><p>And what I\u2019ve learned from these past years is, it\u2019s all okay, we all experience the both sides.</p><p><i>Why</i> do you live all these is a good question if you don\u2019t ask it as a complaint. Is it because of Venus the bitch? Universe showing you old problems in new forms so you to finally solve them? Instagram posts you hate in jealousy? </p><p>The last one definitely finds its own way somehow. But don\u2019t deny it all comes back to you. No you can\u2019t control everything, yes they manipulate us even within our deepest actions, and there\u2019re endless variables inside this equation that reaches the results we can\u2019t dream, but you\u2019re not the center of any universe, you\u2019re part of it. So it\u2019s only natural you\u2019re evolving together, you can\u2019t expect controlling it all over. You should welcome the surprises, bad or good, by taking risks. And work so hard so you can have a few lucky chances.\u00a0</p><p>Making the same mistakes takes me similar results, I can\u2019t claim it\u2019s the Venus or the Universe.</p><p>As in a dinner we were sharing together there was nothing to talk, out of blue Freud made us realize, or it was just me realizing for the first time that, Universe doesn\u2019t bring you old problems in new shapes, you were never in peace with your actions so you lead the way to the old mistaken routs, to see if you can solve it, that it was not your mistake but others\u2019. Well it\u2019s not, some routs are closed by\u00a0circumstances, or you\u2019re not facing the truths. Or in my case, I began to assume the odd and quick way is also normal. I\u2019m taking my experience after all, I\u2019ll always be unstable and messy, though don\u2019t want fake games no longer as my reality.</p><p><i>*Erich Fromm - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikizeroo.net%2Findex.php%3Fq%3DaHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvVGhlX0FydF9vZl9Mb3Zpbmc&amp;t=YzI4NjM5NjhlMTYwMDM4YTVkMjE3YmQwMTQ2NWI1NTM1OWRiZTdmYyxhOGU0NWQ5YTZlNjIwZDNhODdhNGI4ZmU1N2ZlMjNlOGYyNTk0OTA4\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Loving</a>, Lennon - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fquotes%2F1089621-they-made-us-believe-that-each-one-of-us-is&amp;t=YjA1MWJlNjRiNjk2NzlkZmRhZTVhMWM1ODgxZmMyYWFlMDNlOTQwOCw3ZTVkYzYzMWNlMTQ5N2NjMDhlYmE5MjU0MWJmYmRmNjVlYzg1NDVl\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> quote, JKR - especially <a href=\"http://bikarakoydegil.tumblr.com/post/146227808702/jk-rowling-2008-harvard-mezunlar%C4%B1-diploma\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> and <a href=\"http://bikarakoydegil.tumblr.com/post/146227816582/jk-rowling-2008-harvard-mezunlar%C4%B1-diploma\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>, Melis - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DkRysKBdB0fs&amp;t=YTk3MTZiZmNlNDVmZDk4ZGEyOWYyZjgxZWY5MmU3ZTg3Mjk0NzliOCxhNzNlOTk1NTlmNWI0NzEyMTk5ZDM0MDA0ZTcwN2Q4MzU2OWJmMmI2\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>, Taylor - probably every single song she\u2019s written on her last 2 albums</i></p><p><i>\n\n<i>\n\n<i>(<a href=\"http://bikarakoydegil.tumblr.com/post/170877301667/love-a-laserquest\" target=\"_blank\">Ch.
