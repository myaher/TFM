I think they\u2019d do this to\u00a0\u201cpreserve one direction\u2019s image\u201d. Like Niall was pretty much KNOWN for his blonde hair and Irish accent so why should he change his hair to his natural hair color when in 1D he had blonde hair? It\u2019s kind of the same thing with\u00a0\u201cno one was allowed to dye their hair\u201d but opposite. Which is really really weird and sort of hypocritical but in all honesty in a business point of view, it would make total sense.\u00a0</p><p>3. <b>A whole bunch of stunts would resurface</b> and will literally come up in every. single. interview. And yeah, I understand that it&rsquo;d be for publicity or whatever but I\u2019m 100% sure that us as fans and even the boys are done with all that bullshit. (Maybe that\u2019s why they\u2019re keeping baby gate! That, or they\u2019ve taken it too far to quit now)</p><p>4. And if someone communicates this to whoever is in charge of what goes into interviews, some <b>brand new fucking stunts</b> will come into play and you bet your ass it\u2019s gonna be either Harry or Louis bc apparently their management hates them. But who really knows it could be any of the boys. But all in all, there\u2019d definitely be more bullshit stunts which we\u2019d know from the get-go, that they&rsquo;re all fake.\u00a0</p><p>5.<b> All of their freedom will get taken away.</b> This basically ties in all in the other things but Harry\u2019s finally able to do what he wants and what makes him happy. An example would be what I said in the first one: He wouldn\u2019t be allowed to wear any sparkly or shiny kind of suits or anything. But he also wouldn\u2019t be allowed to wear lipstick. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t allowed to in the past so why would the rules change just because a couple years passed? (I feel like most of us know this already but a little refresher) Back in 2015 it took literally 20 minutes of repeatedly asking and pleading Harry to take it off before going on live TV.\u00a0</p><p>The only thing I can think of all of these NOT happening, is if by some chance, they collectively decide to switch their management. But honestly, all of them are doing well for themselves as solo artists so although I really want 1D back, I\u2019m happy if they\u2019re happy and if they\u2019re trying to make a name for themselves instead of\u00a0\u201coh, wasn\u2019t he in that boyband?\u201d.\u00a0</p>",

It could be just a look one guy gives her when they were at a social gathering, or the way one of their neighbors touched her arm too many times during a conversation.</p><p>Y/N had told him too often that he had got to trust her if they wanted their relationship to last, and he&rsquo;d also told her frequently that it wasn&rsquo;t her he didn&rsquo;t trust, it&rsquo;s them. The problem lied in the fact that she was so lovable that people fell for her very easily. She was kind, which was one of the many reasons why he loved her, but it got frustrating sometimes because many often mistaken kindness for affection.</p><p>It all began when their doorman Albert passed away and a replacement arrived only a day after that. This one was much younger than Albert, but still older than Harry and Y/N. Harry didn&rsquo;t know much about him, only that his name was Nam and he didn&rsquo;t say hello&hellip;to Harry at least. Albert used to say hello every time Harry entered the building. So his first impression about Nam was already bad.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t as good-looking as Harry (Harry thought so but he&rsquo;d also asked for Niall&rsquo;s opinion so he guessed that was fair), nor as funny (this, Niall had also confirmed, what a good friend), but somehow the old ladies in the building liked him a lot, probably because he gave out this positive vibe to everyone, well everyone <i>except </i>Harry.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Good evening, Y/N! Hello, Treasure!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as he followed his girlfriend, who was holding their kitty Treasure, towards the lift, feeling Nam&rsquo;s eyes lingered on them until they were finally out of his sight.</p><p>&ldquo;I fucking told you! He hates me!&rdquo; Harry breathed harshly once the door closed in front of them and the lift started moving up.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve never talked to him, H. You can&rsquo;t expect someone to be friendly to you if you always give them death glares,&rdquo; said Y/N as she smiled at her boyfriend. Treasure meowed to agree with her mum, leaving Harry on his own in this battle against their new doorman.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like Treasure has ever talked to him! She&rsquo;s a cat!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She plays with him all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry immediately furrowed his eyebrows at the cat. &ldquo;Daddy is very disappointed.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t say anything, just snorted and exited the lift when the door finally opened on the 10th floor. The couple get to their flat and Harry searched for the key in his girlfriend&rsquo;s bag, which he was carrying for her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being paranoid,&rdquo; he spoke while unlocking the door. &ldquo;You should have seen his face this morning when you left the building wearing that <i>incredibly </i>tight skirt. Well, <i>not </i>that I complain about that skirt, but it annoyed me how he didn&rsquo;t even try to be subtle.&rdquo;</p><p>As they entered, Y/N raised an eyebrow questioningly at her boyfriend. &ldquo;Was that why you suddenly gave me your trench coat? So he would stop staring at my bum?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but&hellip;&rdquo; He looked at her, trying to come up with a good reason but ends up saying, &ldquo;I also didn&rsquo;t want your bum to get cold.&rdquo;</p><p>His answer made Y/N chuckle and roll her eyes. Yes, Harry Styles everyone, the one and only man she&rsquo;d ever loved.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>A few days later, Harry came home and finds Y/N talking to their doorman. She was too busy laughing at something that man had just said and didn&rsquo;t even notice Harry&rsquo;s arrival.</p><p>Harry clenched his jaw and intended to walk over there to interrupt their conversation, when suddenly Nam reached out and ran his fingers through her hair, tucking a strand behind her ear like Harry normally did.</p><p><i>That</i> was the last straw.</p><p>Without thinking twice, Harry stormed towards his girlfriend and the other man as he called Y/N loudly by a loving nickname (because he can), which got her attention right away. Y/N smiled as soon as she saw him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re home early!&rdquo; She said, leaning in for a peck, but got completely startled when her boyfriend pulled her close and kissed her hard on the lips. Of course, normally Y/N would be more than willing to be kissed like <i>that</i>, but now she didn&rsquo;t feel very comfortable when her new friend was watching them. She slightly pushed him away, all out of breath and a bit confused too.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy to see me?&rdquo; She whispered with a soft smile, receiving one from Harry in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he answered shortly and grabbed her hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry completely ignored Nam&rsquo;s existence as he urged them both to leave, not giving Y/N a chance to say goodbye. That was when she realized what was going on there.</p><p>Once they&rsquo;d got into the lift, she turned to him, clearly annoyed. &ldquo;What was that all about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was touching your hair, Y/N. I should be the one to ask you that question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was being friendly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of friend run their fingers through their friend&rsquo;s hair? You don&rsquo;t see me do that to Layla or Trix! And Niall surely has never done that to you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine&hellip;I won&rsquo;t let him do that again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he replied, not looking at her, which didn&rsquo;t seem fine at all. So she moved closer and nudged his side with her elbow, raising an eyebrow.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;H, are you <i>really</i> fine?&rdquo; she laughed slightly when he kept a straight face.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said after a moment, this time, looking at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Not mad at me?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;No, you said you wouldn&rsquo;t let it happen again, and I trust you.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Y/N knew Harry too well, so even though she&rsquo;d heard him say those words loud and clear with her own ears, she still felt the need to ask for confirmation once again, you know, just in case.</p><p>&ldquo;You promise?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, pressing his lips into a small smile and she did too before bringing his face down to kiss him on the cheek. He had promised, so she believed him, and didn&rsquo;t think about it anymore&hellip;</p><p>&hellip;well&hellip;</p><p>&hellip;until the next day.</p><p>Y/N cane home the next day to find him already home. That was weird because he had never come home before she did. Something smelt fishy, and it was certainly not the fish he was cooking in the kitchen. It&rsquo;s the fact that he wasn&rsquo;t doing it <i>alone</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;What is<i> </i>she doing here?&rdquo; Y/N asked as she stayed at the kitchen door, startled by the presence of their catsitter/neighbor/the weird girl across the hall/Harry&rsquo;s <i>(not so secretive)</i> secret admirer who just happened to hate Y/N to the guts.</p><p>&ldquo;Sage&rsquo;s here to play with Treasure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? You&rsquo;re home, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Y/N raises an eyebrow and stared the other woman down until she turned away because it started to get uncomfortable. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s <i>not</i> playing with Treasure, she&rsquo;s cooking with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making dinner,&rdquo; Harry said and his choice of subject for that sentence irritated Y/N deeply.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She asserted, wiggling her fingers between him and herself. &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re</i> making dinner. Why is <i>she</i> here?&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as Y/N had made that question, the answer hit her right in the face. She widened her eyes at her boyfriend, who pretended to look confused, yet she knew exactly what his intention was.</p><p>&ldquo;How. Dare. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Harry shrugged, though she could swear he was well aware of what was going on there. The indifferent look on his face got on her nerves, so she immediately turned to their neighbor and requested Sage to leave her alone with her boyfriend.</p><p>The confused girl fixed her glasses, looking as puzzled as ever. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re in the midd\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ, just leave, Page, or I swear to God&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually<i> Sage</i>, but&hellip;okay&hellip;I&rsquo;m leaving!&rdquo; Sage raised both hands, still avoiding Y/N&rsquo;s eyes at all costs as she mumbled a goodbye to Harry and the cat before rushing out of their kitchen, and out of the flat.</p><p>Once she was long gone. Y/N turned back to Harry with a killer look on her face, letting him know he was now in deep, deep, <i>deep shit</i>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Un-<i>fucking</i>-believable!&rdquo; She began with a sarcastic laugh and slammed both hands down on the table, causing her man to flinch and swallow hard.</p><p>He looked frightened. <i>Good</i>, she thinks<i>. He should be!</i></p><p>&ldquo;You invited her here to get back at me, didn&rsquo;t you?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; he lied, crossing his arms as if this new position would make his words seem more believable. Y/N had known him too well and too long to not see what he was trying to do.</p><p>&ldquo;You did, Harry! I&rsquo;m so disappointed in you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you making a big deal out of this? I didn&rsquo;t let her touch my hair!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. My. God!&rdquo; Y/N exclaimed, holding her head with both hands in a dramatic manner, which freaked him out a bit to be honest. &ldquo;I fucking knew it! I FUCKING knew it! You did that to get back at me!&rdquo;</p><p><i>Okay, now she&rsquo;s really mad</i>, the little voice inside Harry&rsquo;s head told him. Y/N didn&rsquo;t get angry very often (thank God), but whenever she did.</p><p>She <i>did</i>.</p><p>Now the only thing inside his head was Justin Bieber singing, &rsquo;<i>is it too late now to say sorry?</i>&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unforgivable this time!&rdquo;</p><p><i>Okay, so it</i><b><i> is</i></b><i> too late to say sorry&hellip;</i></p><p>He could imagine smoke coming out of Y/N&rsquo;s head at the moment. Whatever he was going to say next, there was no way she would listen.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not only an immature little kid, but also a fucking liar! You promised me you would let this go but nooooo you still had to find a way to get back at me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But she did come here to see Treasure&hellip;&rdquo; Harry began, knowing it was a bad idea to speak, but not knowing why he did anyway.</p><p>Sage might have come here on her own but it was him who had asked her to stay and hang, because he had known it would piss Y/N off. So&hellip;he really was wrong, no matter how hard he tried to deny it to himself, or to his girlfriend who was clearly not in the mood for his useless explanations.</p><p>&ldquo;You knew she had been spreading false rumors about me, that she hated me, so you invited her here and played happy family, knowing I&rsquo;ll be upset! This is a competition to you, isn&rsquo;t it? You always have to win!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I\u2014&rdquo; <i>She&rsquo;s right. Shut up.</i><br/></p><p>&ldquo;And not only that, you also brought Treasure into this! You are a terrible parent, Harry!&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Harry looked at their kitty, who meowed to agree with Y/N, making him feel much worse. Maybe he&rsquo;d gone a bit far this time. Maybe his other baby hated him too.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;baby&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Y/N me. <i>You</i>\u2014&rdquo; she pointed a finger at him &ldquo;\u2014are sleeping on the sofa tonight.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Fuck</i>, he thought to himself when she stormed out of the kitchen and a loud door slam followed soon after that. Once silence sank in, Harry let out a sigh as he looked at the kitty who was already looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t hate me, right?&rdquo; He asked her.</p><p>However, just as he finished that sentence, she stood up on four feet and followed her mum out of the kitchen as well.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was getting late and Nam was drinking alone.</p><p>There weren&rsquo;t many guests entering and leaving the building anymore so nobody was going to report him for drinking during his shift. That was why he loved doing night shifts so much.</p><p>Nam was getting quite tipsy already when he heard the lift arrive on the ground floor. Harry stepped out into the lobby, wrapped around by a blanket. His eyes were weary and his hair a mess. He marched straight to the couch in the middle of the lobby and took off the weight of his body to land on the comfy piece of furniture.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna sleep there?&rdquo; Nam spoke up. &ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s against the rules.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure drinking while working is also against the rules.&rdquo; Harry yawned, not bothering to even look at Nam.</p><p>The doorman knew he&rsquo;d been caught, so he couldn&rsquo;t tell Harry to leave anymore. Instead, he walked over to the distressed young man and took a seat right next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Trouble in paradise?&rdquo; He asked, chuckling a bit at the grumpy look on Harry&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, I don&rsquo;t want to talk right now, especially to<i> you</i>, no offense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That hurts my feelings, dude.&rdquo;</p><p>If Harry hadn&rsquo;t been too tired, he would&rsquo;ve punched this man in the face. Lucky for Nam, he was exhausted. His girlfriend didn&rsquo;t let him into the bedroom, and his cat was sleeping on the couch so he had had no choice but to come down here, still better than sleeping on the floor.</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow at the doorman. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be happy Y/N and I are fighting?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would I be?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry snorted at the reply without saying anything else.</p><p>Suddenly, Nam leaned in closer. They almost shared a kiss when Harry pulled back just in time, even though he was very surprised by the other man&rsquo;s action.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Harry asked, eyebrows knitted together in confusion and shock, while Nam looked just as appalled, probably more. He quickly buried his face into his palms and groaned out loud, knowing it was very stupid of him to have made that attempt. He was drunk and hadn&rsquo;t been thinking straight (no pun intended), and Harry just looked so&hellip;<i>kissable</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you try to kiss me?&rdquo; Harry pointed a finger at himself, raising both eyebrows and his mouth was agape because he still couldn&rsquo;t believe what just happened, <i>happened</i>.</p><p>Nam shyly nodded his head and mumbled a small yes, along with an apology.</p><p>&ldquo;So you're\u2014&rdquo; Harry paused a bit, squinting his eyes &ldquo;\u2014not into Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>That question made the doorman laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? No! She&rsquo;s like a baby sister to me!&rdquo; Nam confessed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m into men&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Again?!&rdquo; Harry exclaimed, facepalming himself. Then he quickly noticed how offended Nam looked, so he had to explain, &ldquo;sorry&hellip;it&rsquo;s just&hellip;this happened once before&hellip;I thought someone else was also flirting with Y/N but he also told me he was gay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fun.&rdquo; Nam chuckles then immediately stopped when he saw Harry raising an eyebrow at him. &ldquo;Not that your girlfriend is not desirable&hellip;She&rsquo;s cute, she&rsquo;s just not&hellip;my type.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry sighed. Well, at least now he knew he was <i>half</i> right when he said Nam had been checking Y/N out, it just wasn&rsquo;t Y/N&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Does Y/N know about this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About me being gay or me being into you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She already knows I&rsquo;m gay. At first I wanted to talk to you but you intimidated me so I talked to her, but she seemed like a really nice person and I really like being her friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t tell her you liked me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not! But let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;ll be afraid of losing you to me, you&rsquo;re obviously into vag.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry breathed out a laugh for how Nam had just said that with a straight face.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Look, Y/N doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of friends. If she knows you were into me, she&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;re hanging out with her to get to me and not because you want to. I don&rsquo;t want her to be sad. So either if that is true or not, I&rsquo;d appreciate if you don&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nam smiled then patted Harry on the back. &ldquo;Y/N is a very lucky girl. And I&rsquo;m sorry I tried to kiss you. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was thinking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Harry smiled back tiredly, feeling kind of relief because even though his instinct was wrong once again, nobody else was after his girl.</p><p>However, she was still mad at him. So now he&rsquo;d have to wait until the morning came to return home and ask for her forgiveness.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Harry came back to their flat, he bumped right into Y/N the moment he opened the door. The first thing she did when she saw him was to wrap her arms around his torso, pulling him in for a tight hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Where have you been?! Oh God, I thought you left me!&rdquo; She said, which made him smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You took the bed and Treasure took the couch so I had to sleep in the lobby,&rdquo; he replied, holding her chin up and pressing his lips to hers. &ldquo;Also, I&rsquo;m very sorry about last night. You were right&hellip;I was so fucking immature.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m sorry too. I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone batshit crazy and yelled at you then locked you out.&rdquo; She frowned, holding his hands which are cupping her cheeks. &ldquo;I might go to hell for this, but there&rsquo;s something I need to tell you&hellip;Nam&hellip;he&rsquo;s&hellip;he&rsquo;s not really&hellip;\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, he\u2014&rdquo; Y/N halted immediately and widened her eyes when she realized what he had just said. &ldquo;Wait! How did you know?!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry released a soft laugh in reaction to the look on her face. &ldquo;He told me last night.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N immediately exhaled, laying one hand on her chest, just like a heavy weight had been lifted from it. &ldquo;He made me promise not to tell anyone, not even you. That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t tell you, but I couldn&rsquo;t risk having you think I was cheating on you or anything, so I had to\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes then interrupted her rambling by pressing his lips to hers, shutting her up with a kiss. It would be a lie if Y/N said she didn&rsquo;t wish he would do this more often. When they pulled away, it took almost three seconds to finally open her eyes.</p><p>He was smirking at her when he said, &ldquo;you were right, and I was wrong, and I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I was wrong, you were right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are we about to argue to see who&rsquo;s wrong and who&rsquo;s right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Y/N laughed as she rolled her eyes, palms laying flat on her chest. &ldquo;Last night I thought a lot about what happened. You were only being protective of me, and at least you still loved me enough to even get jealous. Maybe in a few years you won&rsquo;t even care who I&rsquo;m with and I&rsquo;ll miss you being jealous all the time.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo; Harry grimaced when he heard her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always gonna care.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;How can you be so sure? Maybe we&rsquo;ll go back to hating each other like we used to.&rdquo; She laughed between the words. But he knew somewhere behind her humor was something she was actually worried about.</p><p>Harry held her shoulders and leaned down a bit so their faces were at the same level, then he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought you&rsquo;re great, Y/N, even back then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liar.&rdquo; She snorted, making him shake his head to disagree.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m serious. You only annoyed me because sometimes you made me soft and sentimental and I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that I liked it. Now I don&rsquo;t want anyone else to feel that way about you, <i>only me</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, baby.&rdquo; Y/N bit back a smile as she looked up at her boyfriend, but he jumped into her mouth before she could speak again.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t finished, Y/N.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>She huffed and told him to go on.</p><p>&ldquo;And I want you to know that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about Sage or any other women, because I don&rsquo;t even want anyone else. I&rsquo;ll love you no matter what and will always be overprotective when it comes to you, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Her heart was filled with love from hearing his little speech, and she swore she almost teared up in front of him. Luckily, she started beaming instead, definitely unable to stop now.</p><p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;You have become waaaaaay too soft and sentimental.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; Harry grumbled as he pulled her in and kissed her forehead, knowing she&rsquo;d love him no matter what he became.</p>",

Hello, Treasure!\u201d</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as he followed his girlfriend, who was holding their kitty Treasure, towards the lift, feeling Nam\u2019s eyes lingered on them until they were finally out of his sight.</p><p>\u201cI fucking told you! He hates me!\u201d Harry breathed harshly once the door closed in front of them and the lift started moving up.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve never talked to him, H. You can\u2019t expect someone to be friendly to you if you always give them death glares,\u201d said Y/N as she smiled at her boyfriend. Treasure meowed to agree with her mum, leaving Harry on his own in this battle against their new doorman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Treasure has ever talked to him! She\u2019s a cat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe plays with him all the time.\u201d</p><p>Harry immediately furrowed his eyebrows at the cat. \u201cDaddy is very disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t say anything, just snorted and exited the lift when the door finally opened on the 10th floor. The couple get to their flat and Harry searched for the key in his girlfriend\u2019s bag, which he was carrying for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being paranoid,\u201d he spoke while unlocking the door. \u201cYou should have seen his face this morning when you left the building wearing that <i>incredibly </i>tight skirt. Well, <i>not </i>that I complain about that skirt, but it annoyed me how he didn\u2019t even try to be subtle.\u201d</p><p>As they entered, Y/N raised an eyebrow questioningly at her boyfriend. \u201cWas that why you suddenly gave me your trench coat? So he would stop staring at my bum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d He looked at her, trying to come up with a good reason but ends up saying, \u201cI also didn\u2019t want your bum to get cold.\u201d</p><p>His answer made Y/N chuckle and roll her eyes. Yes, Harry Styles everyone, the one and only man she\u2019d ever loved.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>A few days later, Harry came home and finds Y/N talking to their doorman. She was too busy laughing at something that man had just said and didn\u2019t even notice Harry\u2019s arrival.</p><p>Harry clenched his jaw and intended to walk over there to interrupt their conversation, when suddenly Nam reached out and ran his fingers through her hair, tucking a strand behind her ear like Harry normally did.</p><p><i>That</i> was the last straw.</p><p>Without thinking twice, Harry stormed towards his girlfriend and the other man as he called Y/N loudly by a loving nickname (because he can), which got her attention right away. Y/N smiled as soon as she saw him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home early!\u201d She said, leaning in for a peck, but got completely startled when her boyfriend pulled her close and kissed her hard on the lips. Of course, normally Y/N would be more than willing to be kissed like <i>that</i>, but now she didn\u2019t feel very comfortable when her new friend was watching them. She slightly pushed him away, all out of breath and a bit confused too.</p><p>\u201cHappy to see me?\u201d She whispered with a soft smile, receiving one from Harry in return.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d he answered shortly and grabbed her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Harry completely ignored Nam\u2019s existence as he urged them both to leave, not giving Y/N a chance to say goodbye. That was when she realized what was going on there.</p><p>Once they\u2019d got into the lift, she turned to him, clearly annoyed. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was touching your hair, Y/N. I should be the one to ask you that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of friend run their fingers through their friend\u2019s hair? You don\u2019t see me do that to Layla or Trix! And Niall surely has never done that to you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026I won\u2019t let him do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he replied, not looking at her, which didn\u2019t seem fine at all. So she moved closer and nudged his side with her elbow, raising an eyebrow.<br></p><p>\u201cH, are you <i>really</i> fine?\u201d she laughed slightly when he kept a straight face.<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said after a moment, this time, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cNot mad at me?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, you said you wouldn\u2019t let it happen again, and I trust you.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N knew Harry too well, so even though she\u2019d heard him say those words loud and clear with her own ears, she still felt the need to ask for confirmation once again, you know, just in case.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, pressing his lips into a small smile and she did too before bringing his face down to kiss him on the cheek. He had promised, so she believed him, and didn\u2019t think about it anymore\u2026</p><p>\u2026well\u2026</p><p>\u2026until the next day.</p><p>Y/N cane home the next day to find him already home. That was weird because he had never come home before she did. Something smelt fishy, and it was certainly not the fish he was cooking in the kitchen. It\u2019s the fact that he wasn\u2019t doing it <i>alone</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhat is<i> </i>she doing here?\u201d Y/N asked as she stayed at the kitchen door, startled by the presence of their catsitter/neighbor/the weird girl across the hall/Harry\u2019s <i>(not so secretive)</i> secret admirer who just happened to hate Y/N to the guts.</p><p>\u201cSage\u2019s here to play with Treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re home, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Y/N raises an eyebrow and stared the other woman down until she turned away because it started to get uncomfortable. \u201cAnd she\u2019s <i>not</i> playing with Treasure, she\u2019s cooking with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making dinner,\u201d Harry said and his choice of subject for that sentence irritated Y/N deeply.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She asserted, wiggling her fingers between him and herself. \u201c<i>We\u2019re</i> making dinner. Why is <i>she</i> here?\u201d</p><p>As soon as Y/N had made that question, the answer hit her right in the face. She widened her eyes at her boyfriend, who pretended to look confused, yet she knew exactly what his intention was.</p><p>\u201cHow. Dare. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry shrugged, though she could swear he was well aware of what was going on there. The indifferent look on his face got on her nerves, so she immediately turned to their neighbor and requested Sage to leave her alone with her boyfriend.</p><p>The confused girl fixed her glasses, looking as puzzled as ever. \u201cBut we\u2019re in the midd\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, just leave, Page, or I swear to God\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually<i> Sage</i>, but\u2026okay\u2026I\u2019m leaving!\u201d Sage raised both hands, still avoiding Y/N\u2019s eyes at all costs as she mumbled a goodbye to Harry and the cat before rushing out of their kitchen, and out of the flat.</p><p>Once she was long gone. Y/N turned back to Harry with a killer look on her face, letting him know he was now in deep, deep, <i>deep shit</i>\u2026</p><p>\u201cUn-<i>fucking</i>-believable!\u201d She began with a sarcastic laugh and slammed both hands down on the table, causing her man to flinch and swallow hard.</p><p>He looked frightened. <i>Good</i>, she thinks<i>. He should be!</i></p><p>\u201cYou invited her here to get back at me, didn\u2019t you?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d he lied, crossing his arms as if this new position would make his words seem more believable. Y/N had known him too well and too long to not see what he was trying to do.</p><p>\u201cYou did, Harry! I\u2019m so disappointed in you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making a big deal out of this? I didn\u2019t let her touch my hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God!\u201d Y/N exclaimed, holding her head with both hands in a dramatic manner, which freaked him out a bit to be honest. \u201cI fucking knew it! I FUCKING knew it! You did that to get back at me!\u201d</p><p><i>Okay, now she\u2019s really mad</i>, the little voice inside Harry\u2019s head told him. Y/N didn\u2019t get angry very often (thank God), but whenever she did.</p><p>She <i>did</i>.</p><p>Now the only thing inside his head was Justin Bieber singing, \u2019<i>is it too late now to say sorry?</i>\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unforgivable this time!\u201d</p><p><i>Okay, so it</i><b><i> is</i></b><i> too late to say sorry\u2026</i></p><p>He could imagine smoke coming out of Y/N\u2019s head at the moment. Whatever he was going to say next, there was no way she would listen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not only an immature little kid, but also a fucking liar! You promised me you would let this go but nooooo you still had to find a way to get back at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she did come here to see Treasure\u2026\u201d Harry began, knowing it was a bad idea to speak, but not knowing why he did anyway.</p><p>Sage might have come here on her own but it was him who had asked her to stay and hang, because he had known it would piss Y/N off. So\u2026he really was wrong, no matter how hard he tried to deny it to himself, or to his girlfriend who was clearly not in the mood for his useless explanations.</p><p>\u201cYou knew she had been spreading false rumors about me, that she hated me, so you invited her here and played happy family, knowing I\u2019ll be upset! This is a competition to you, isn\u2019t it? You always have to win!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d <i>She\u2019s right. Shut up.</i><br></p><p>\u201cAnd not only that, you also brought Treasure into this! You are a terrible parent, Harry!\u201d<br></p><p>Harry looked at their kitty, who meowed to agree with Y/N, making him feel much worse. Maybe he\u2019d gone a bit far this time. Maybe his other baby hated him too.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026baby\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Y/N me. <i>You</i>\u2014\u201d she pointed a finger at him \u201c\u2014are sleeping on the sofa tonight.\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck</i>, he thought to himself when she stormed out of the kitchen and a loud door slam followed soon after that. Once silence sank in, Harry let out a sigh as he looked at the kitty who was already looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me, right?\u201d He asked her.</p><p>However, just as he finished that sentence, she stood up on four feet and followed her mum out of the kitchen as well.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was getting late and Nam was drinking alone.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many guests entering and leaving the building anymore so nobody was going to report him for drinking during his shift. That was why he loved doing night shifts so much.</p><p>Nam was getting quite tipsy already when he heard the lift arrive on the ground floor. Harry stepped out into the lobby, wrapped around by a blanket. His eyes were weary and his hair a mess. He marched straight to the couch in the middle of the lobby and took off the weight of his body to land on the comfy piece of furniture.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna sleep there?\u201d Nam spoke up. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t, it\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure drinking while working is also against the rules.\u201d Harry yawned, not bothering to even look at Nam.</p><p>The doorman knew he\u2019d been caught, so he couldn\u2019t tell Harry to leave anymore. Instead, he walked over to the distressed young man and took a seat right next to him.</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d He asked, chuckling a bit at the grumpy look on Harry\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDude, I don\u2019t want to talk right now, especially to<i> you</i>, no offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hurts my feelings, dude.\u201d</p><p>If Harry hadn\u2019t been too tired, he would\u2019ve punched this man in the face. Lucky for Nam, he was exhausted. His girlfriend didn\u2019t let him into the bedroom, and his cat was sleeping on the couch so he had had no choice but to come down here, still better than sleeping on the floor.</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow at the doorman. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be happy Y/N and I are fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be?\u201d</p><p>Harry snorted at the reply without saying anything else.</p><p>Suddenly, Nam leaned in closer. They almost shared a kiss when Harry pulled back just in time, even though he was very surprised by the other man\u2019s action.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Harry asked, eyebrows knitted together in confusion and shock, while Nam looked just as appalled, probably more. He quickly buried his face into his palms and groaned out loud, knowing it was very stupid of him to have made that attempt. He was drunk and hadn\u2019t been thinking straight (no pun intended), and Harry just looked so\u2026<i>kissable</i>.</p><p>\u201cDid you try to kiss me?\u201d Harry pointed a finger at himself, raising both eyebrows and his mouth was agape because he still couldn\u2019t believe what just happened, <i>happened</i>.</p><p>Nam shyly nodded his head and mumbled a small yes, along with an apology.</p><p>\u201cSo you're\u2014\u201d Harry paused a bit, squinting his eyes \u201c\u2014not into Y/N?\u201d</p><p>That question made the doorman laugh.</p><p>\u201cY/N? No! She\u2019s like a baby sister to me!\u201d Nam confessed. \u201cI\u2019m into men\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?!\u201d Harry exclaimed, facepalming himself. Then he quickly noticed how offended Nam looked, so he had to explain, \u201csorry\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026this happened once before\u2026I thought someone else was also flirting with Y/N but he also told me he was gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun.\u201d Nam chuckles then immediately stopped when he saw Harry raising an eyebrow at him. \u201cNot that your girlfriend is not desirable\u2026She\u2019s cute, she\u2019s just not\u2026my type.\u201d</p><p>Harry sighed. Well, at least now he knew he was <i>half</i> right when he said Nam had been checking Y/N out, it just wasn\u2019t Y/N\u2026</p><p>\u201cDoes Y/N know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me being gay or me being into you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knows I\u2019m gay. At first I wanted to talk to you but you intimidated me so I talked to her, but she seemed like a really nice person and I really like being her friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t tell her you liked me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! But let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s not like she\u2019ll be afraid of losing you to me, you\u2019re obviously into vag.\u201d</p><p>Harry breathed out a laugh for how Nam had just said that with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cLook, Y/N doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. If she knows you were into me, she\u2019ll assume you\u2019re hanging out with her to get to me and not because you want to. I don\u2019t want her to be sad. So either if that is true or not, I\u2019d appreciate if you don\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t.\u201d Nam smiled then patted Harry on the back. \u201cY/N is a very lucky girl. And I\u2019m sorry I tried to kiss you. I didn\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Harry smiled back tiredly, feeling kind of relief because even though his instinct was wrong once again, nobody else was after his girl.</p><p>However, she was still mad at him. So now he\u2019d have to wait until the morning came to return home and ask for her forgiveness.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Harry came back to their flat, he bumped right into Y/N the moment he opened the door. The first thing she did when she saw him was to wrap her arms around his torso, pulling him in for a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?! Oh God, I thought you left me!\u201d She said, which made him smile.</p><p>\u201cYou took the bed and Treasure took the couch so I had to sleep in the lobby,\u201d he replied, holding her chin up and pressing his lips to hers. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m very sorry about last night. You were right\u2026I was so fucking immature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sorry too. I shouldn\u2019t have gone batshit crazy and yelled at you then locked you out.\u201d She frowned, holding his hands which are cupping her cheeks. \u201cI might go to hell for this, but there\u2019s something I need to tell you\u2026Nam\u2026he\u2019s\u2026he\u2019s not really\u2026\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2014\u201d Y/N halted immediately and widened her eyes when she realized what he had just said. \u201cWait! How did you know?!\u201d</p><p>Harry released a soft laugh in reaction to the look on her face. \u201cHe told me last night.\u201d</p><p>Y/N immediately exhaled, laying one hand on her chest, just like a heavy weight had been lifted from it. \u201cHe made me promise not to tell anyone, not even you. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t tell you, but I couldn\u2019t risk having you think I was cheating on you or anything, so I had to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes then interrupted her rambling by pressing his lips to hers, shutting her up with a kiss. It would be a lie if Y/N said she didn\u2019t wish he would do this more often. When they pulled away, it took almost three seconds to finally open her eyes.</p><p>He was smirking at her when he said, \u201cyou were right, and I was wrong, and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was wrong, you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we about to argue to see who\u2019s wrong and who\u2019s right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N laughed as she rolled her eyes, palms laying flat on her chest. \u201cLast night I thought a lot about what happened. You were only being protective of me, and at least you still loved me enough to even get jealous. Maybe in a few years you won\u2019t even care who I\u2019m with and I\u2019ll miss you being jealous all the time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not true.\u201d Harry grimaced when he heard her. \u201cI\u2019m always gonna care.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure? Maybe we\u2019ll go back to hating each other like we used to.\u201d She laughed between the words. But he knew somewhere behind her humor was something she was actually worried about.</p><p>Harry held her shoulders and leaned down a bit so their faces were at the same level, then he said, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you\u2019re great, Y/N, even back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d She snorted, making him shake his head to disagree.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. You only annoyed me because sometimes you made me soft and sentimental and I didn\u2019t like the fact that I liked it. Now I don\u2019t want anyone else to feel that way about you, <i>only me</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, baby.\u201d Y/N bit back a smile as she looked up at her boyfriend, but he jumped into her mouth before she could speak again.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t finished, Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>She huffed and told him to go on.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want you to know that you don\u2019t need to worry about Sage or any other women, because I don\u2019t even want anyone else. I\u2019ll love you no matter what and will always be overprotective when it comes to you, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was filled with love from hearing his little speech, and she swore she almost teared up in front of him. Luckily, she started beaming instead, definitely unable to stop now.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she said to him. \u201cYou have become waaaaaay too soft and sentimental.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d Harry grumbled as he pulled her in and kissed her forehead, knowing she\u2019d love him no matter what he became.</p></p>",

It could be just a look one guy gives her when they were at a social gathering, or the way one of their neighbors touched her arm too many times during a conversation.</p><p>Y/N had told him too often that he had got to trust her if they wanted their relationship to last, and he\u2019d also told her frequently that it wasn\u2019t her he didn\u2019t trust, it\u2019s them. The problem lied in the fact that she was so lovable that people fell for her very easily. She was kind, which was one of the many reasons why he loved her, but it got frustrating sometimes because many often mistaken kindness for affection.</p><p>It all began when their doorman Albert passed away and a replacement arrived only a day after that. This one was much younger than Albert, but still older than Harry and Y/N. Harry didn\u2019t know much about him, only that his name was Nam and he didn\u2019t say hello\u2026to Harry at least. Albert used to say hello every time Harry entered the building. So his first impression about Nam was already bad.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t as good-looking as Harry (Harry thought so but he\u2019d also asked for Niall\u2019s opinion so he guessed that was fair), nor as funny (this, Niall had also confirmed, what a good friend), but somehow the old ladies in the building liked him a lot, probably because he gave out this positive vibe to everyone, well everyone <i>except </i>Harry.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cGood evening, Y/N! Hello, Treasure!\u201d</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as he followed his girlfriend, who was holding their kitty Treasure, towards the lift, feeling Nam\u2019s eyes lingered on them until they were finally out of his sight.</p><p>\u201cI fucking told you! He hates me!\u201d Harry breathed harshly once the door closed in front of them and the lift started moving up.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve never talked to him, H. You can\u2019t expect someone to be friendly to you if you always give them death glares,\u201d said Y/N as she smiled at her boyfriend. Treasure meowed to agree with her mum, leaving Harry on his own in this battle against their new doorman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Treasure has ever talked to him! She\u2019s a cat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe plays with him all the time.\u201d</p><p>Harry immediately furrowed his eyebrows at the cat. \u201cDaddy is very disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t say anything, just snorted and exited the lift when the door finally opened on the 10th floor. The couple get to their flat and Harry searched for the key in his girlfriend\u2019s bag, which he was carrying for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being paranoid,\u201d he spoke while unlocking the door. \u201cYou should have seen his face this morning when you left the building wearing that <i>incredibly </i>tight skirt. Well, <i>not </i>that I complain about that skirt, but it annoyed me how he didn\u2019t even try to be subtle.\u201d</p><p>As they entered, Y/N raised an eyebrow questioningly at her boyfriend. \u201cWas that why you suddenly gave me your trench coat? So he would stop staring at my bum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d He looked at her, trying to come up with a good reason but ends up saying, \u201cI also didn\u2019t want your bum to get cold.\u201d</p><p>His answer made Y/N chuckle and roll her eyes. Yes, Harry Styles everyone, the one and only man she\u2019d ever loved.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>A few days later, Harry came home and finds Y/N talking to their doorman. She was too busy laughing at something that man had just said and didn\u2019t even notice Harry\u2019s arrival.</p><p>Harry clenched his jaw and intended to walk over there to interrupt their conversation, when suddenly Nam reached out and ran his fingers through her hair, tucking a strand behind her ear like Harry normally did.</p><p><i>That</i> was the last straw.</p><p>Without thinking twice, Harry stormed towards his girlfriend and the other man as he called Y/N loudly by a loving nickname (because he can), which got her attention right away. Y/N smiled as soon as she saw him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home early!\u201d She said, leaning in for a peck, but got completely startled when her boyfriend pulled her close and kissed her hard on the lips. Of course, normally Y/N would be more than willing to be kissed like <i>that</i>, but now she didn\u2019t feel very comfortable when her new friend was watching them. She slightly pushed him away, all out of breath and a bit confused too.</p><p>\u201cHappy to see me?\u201d She whispered with a soft smile, receiving one from Harry in return.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d he answered shortly and grabbed her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Harry completely ignored Nam\u2019s existence as he urged them both to leave, not giving Y/N a chance to say goodbye. That was when she realized what was going on there.</p><p>Once they\u2019d got into the lift, she turned to him, clearly annoyed. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was touching your hair, Y/N. I should be the one to ask you that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of friend run their fingers through their friend\u2019s hair? You don\u2019t see me do that to Layla or Trix! And Niall surely has never done that to you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026I won\u2019t let him do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he replied, not looking at her, which didn\u2019t seem fine at all. So she moved closer and nudged his side with her elbow, raising an eyebrow.<br></p><p>\u201cH, are you <i>really</i> fine?\u201d she laughed slightly when he kept a straight face.<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said after a moment, this time, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cNot mad at me?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, you said you wouldn\u2019t let it happen again, and I trust you.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N knew Harry too well, so even though she\u2019d heard him say those words loud and clear with her own ears, she still felt the need to ask for confirmation once again, you know, just in case.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, pressing his lips into a small smile and she did too before bringing his face down to kiss him on the cheek. He had promised, so she believed him, and didn\u2019t think about it anymore\u2026</p><p>\u2026well\u2026</p><p>\u2026until the next day.</p><p>Y/N cane home the next day to find him already home. That was weird because he had never come home before she did. Something smelt fishy, and it was certainly not the fish he was cooking in the kitchen. It\u2019s the fact that he wasn\u2019t doing it <i>alone</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhat is<i> </i>she doing here?\u201d Y/N asked as she stayed at the kitchen door, startled by the presence of their catsitter/neighbor/the weird girl across the hall/Harry\u2019s <i>(not so secretive)</i> secret admirer who just happened to hate Y/N to the guts.</p><p>\u201cSage\u2019s here to play with Treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re home, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Y/N raises an eyebrow and stared the other woman down until she turned away because it started to get uncomfortable. \u201cAnd she\u2019s <i>not</i> playing with Treasure, she\u2019s cooking with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making dinner,\u201d Harry said and his choice of subject for that sentence irritated Y/N deeply.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She asserted, wiggling her fingers between him and herself. \u201c<i>We\u2019re</i> making dinner. Why is <i>she</i> here?\u201d</p><p>As soon as Y/N had made that question, the answer hit her right in the face. She widened her eyes at her boyfriend, who pretended to look confused, yet she knew exactly what his intention was.</p><p>\u201cHow. Dare. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry shrugged, though she could swear he was well aware of what was going on there. The indifferent look on his face got on her nerves, so she immediately turned to their neighbor and requested Sage to leave her alone with her boyfriend.</p><p>The confused girl fixed her glasses, looking as puzzled as ever. \u201cBut we\u2019re in the midd\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, just leave, Page, or I swear to God\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually<i> Sage</i>, but\u2026okay\u2026I\u2019m leaving!\u201d Sage raised both hands, still avoiding Y/N\u2019s eyes at all costs as she mumbled a goodbye to Harry and the cat before rushing out of their kitchen, and out of the flat.</p><p>Once she was long gone. Y/N turned back to Harry with a killer look on her face, letting him know he was now in deep, deep, <i>deep shit</i>\u2026</p><p>\u201cUn-<i>fucking</i>-believable!\u201d She began with a sarcastic laugh and slammed both hands down on the table, causing her man to flinch and swallow hard.</p><p>He looked frightened. <i>Good</i>, she thinks<i>. He should be!</i></p><p>\u201cYou invited her here to get back at me, didn\u2019t you?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d he lied, crossing his arms as if this new position would make his words seem more believable. Y/N had known him too well and too long to not see what he was trying to do.</p><p>\u201cYou did, Harry! I\u2019m so disappointed in you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making a big deal out of this? I didn\u2019t let her touch my hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God!\u201d Y/N exclaimed, holding her head with both hands in a dramatic manner, which freaked him out a bit to be honest. \u201cI fucking knew it! I FUCKING knew it! You did that to get back at me!\u201d</p><p><i>Okay, now she\u2019s really mad</i>, the little voice inside Harry\u2019s head told him. Y/N didn\u2019t get angry very often (thank God), but whenever she did.</p><p>She <i>did</i>.</p><p>Now the only thing inside his head was Justin Bieber singing, \u2019<i>is it too late now to say sorry?</i>\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unforgivable this time!\u201d</p><p><i>Okay, so it</i><b><i> is</i></b><i> too late to say sorry\u2026</i></p><p>He could imagine smoke coming out of Y/N\u2019s head at the moment. Whatever he was going to say next, there was no way she would listen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not only an immature little kid, but also a fucking liar! You promised me you would let this go but nooooo you still had to find a way to get back at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she did come here to see Treasure\u2026\u201d Harry began, knowing it was a bad idea to speak, but not knowing why he did anyway.</p><p>Sage might have come here on her own but it was him who had asked her to stay and hang, because he had known it would piss Y/N off. So\u2026he really was wrong, no matter how hard he tried to deny it to himself, or to his girlfriend who was clearly not in the mood for his useless explanations.</p><p>\u201cYou knew she had been spreading false rumors about me, that she hated me, so you invited her here and played happy family, knowing I\u2019ll be upset! This is a competition to you, isn\u2019t it? You always have to win!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d <i>She\u2019s right. Shut up.</i><br></p><p>\u201cAnd not only that, you also brought Treasure into this! You are a terrible parent, Harry!\u201d<br></p><p>Harry looked at their kitty, who meowed to agree with Y/N, making him feel much worse. Maybe he\u2019d gone a bit far this time. Maybe his other baby hated him too.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026baby\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Y/N me. <i>You</i>\u2014\u201d she pointed a finger at him \u201c\u2014are sleeping on the sofa tonight.\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck</i>, he thought to himself when she stormed out of the kitchen and a loud door slam followed soon after that. Once silence sank in, Harry let out a sigh as he looked at the kitty who was already looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me, right?\u201d He asked her.</p><p>However, just as he finished that sentence, she stood up on four feet and followed her mum out of the kitchen as well.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was getting late and Nam was drinking alone.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many guests entering and leaving the building anymore so nobody was going to report him for drinking during his shift. That was why he loved doing night shifts so much.</p><p>Nam was getting quite tipsy already when he heard the lift arrive on the ground floor. Harry stepped out into the lobby, wrapped around by a blanket. His eyes were weary and his hair a mess. He marched straight to the couch in the middle of the lobby and took off the weight of his body to land on the comfy piece of furniture.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna sleep there?\u201d Nam spoke up. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t, it\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure drinking while working is also against the rules.\u201d Harry yawned, not bothering to even look at Nam.</p><p>The doorman knew he\u2019d been caught, so he couldn\u2019t tell Harry to leave anymore. Instead, he walked over to the distressed young man and took a seat right next to him.</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d He asked, chuckling a bit at the grumpy look on Harry\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDude, I don\u2019t want to talk right now, especially to<i> you</i>, no offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hurts my feelings, dude.\u201d</p><p>If Harry hadn\u2019t been too tired, he would\u2019ve punched this man in the face. Lucky for Nam, he was exhausted. His girlfriend didn\u2019t let him into the bedroom, and his cat was sleeping on the couch so he had had no choice but to come down here, still better than sleeping on the floor.</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow at the doorman. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be happy Y/N and I are fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be?\u201d</p><p>Harry snorted at the reply without saying anything else.</p><p>Suddenly, Nam leaned in closer. They almost shared a kiss when Harry pulled back just in time, even though he was very surprised by the other man\u2019s action.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Harry asked, eyebrows knitted together in confusion and shock, while Nam looked just as appalled, probably more. He quickly buried his face into his palms and groaned out loud, knowing it was very stupid of him to have made that attempt. He was drunk and hadn\u2019t been thinking straight (no pun intended), and Harry just looked so\u2026<i>kissable</i>.</p><p>\u201cDid you try to kiss me?\u201d Harry pointed a finger at himself, raising both eyebrows and his mouth was agape because he still couldn\u2019t believe what just happened, <i>happened</i>.</p><p>Nam shyly nodded his head and mumbled a small yes, along with an apology.</p><p>\u201cSo you're\u2014\u201d Harry paused a bit, squinting his eyes \u201c\u2014not into Y/N?\u201d</p><p>That question made the doorman laugh.</p><p>\u201cY/N? No! She\u2019s like a baby sister to me!\u201d Nam confessed. \u201cI\u2019m into men\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?!\u201d Harry exclaimed, facepalming himself. Then he quickly noticed how offended Nam looked, so he had to explain, \u201csorry\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026this happened once before\u2026I thought someone else was also flirting with Y/N but he also told me he was gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun.\u201d Nam chuckles then immediately stopped when he saw Harry raising an eyebrow at him. \u201cNot that your girlfriend is not desirable\u2026She\u2019s cute, she\u2019s just not\u2026my type.\u201d</p><p>Harry sighed. Well, at least now he knew he was <i>half</i> right when he said Nam had been checking Y/N out, it just wasn\u2019t Y/N\u2026</p><p>\u201cDoes Y/N know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me being gay or me being into you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knows I\u2019m gay. At first I wanted to talk to you but you intimidated me so I talked to her, but she seemed like a really nice person and I really like being her friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t tell her you liked me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! But let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s not like she\u2019ll be afraid of losing you to me, you\u2019re obviously into vag.\u201d</p><p>Harry breathed out a laugh for how Nam had just said that with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cLook, Y/N doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. If she knows you were into me, she\u2019ll assume you\u2019re hanging out with her to get to me and not because you want to. I don\u2019t want her to be sad. So either if that is true or not, I\u2019d appreciate if you don\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t.\u201d Nam smiled then patted Harry on the back. \u201cY/N is a very lucky girl. And I\u2019m sorry I tried to kiss you. I didn\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Harry smiled back tiredly, feeling kind of relief because even though his instinct was wrong once again, nobody else was after his girl.</p><p>However, she was still mad at him. So now he\u2019d have to wait until the morning came to return home and ask for her forgiveness.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Harry came back to their flat, he bumped right into Y/N the moment he opened the door. The first thing she did when she saw him was to wrap her arms around his torso, pulling him in for a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?! Oh God, I thought you left me!\u201d She said, which made him smile.</p><p>\u201cYou took the bed and Treasure took the couch so I had to sleep in the lobby,\u201d he replied, holding her chin up and pressing his lips to hers. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m very sorry about last night. You were right\u2026I was so fucking immature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sorry too. I shouldn\u2019t have gone batshit crazy and yelled at you then locked you out.\u201d She frowned, holding his hands which are cupping her cheeks. \u201cI might go to hell for this, but there\u2019s something I need to tell you\u2026Nam\u2026he\u2019s\u2026he\u2019s not really\u2026\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2014\u201d Y/N halted immediately and widened her eyes when she realized what he had just said. \u201cWait! How did you know?!\u201d</p><p>Harry released a soft laugh in reaction to the look on her face. \u201cHe told me last night.\u201d</p><p>Y/N immediately exhaled, laying one hand on her chest, just like a heavy weight had been lifted from it. \u201cHe made me promise not to tell anyone, not even you. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t tell you, but I couldn\u2019t risk having you think I was cheating on you or anything, so I had to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes then interrupted her rambling by pressing his lips to hers, shutting her up with a kiss. It would be a lie if Y/N said she didn\u2019t wish he would do this more often. When they pulled away, it took almost three seconds to finally open her eyes.</p><p>He was smirking at her when he said, \u201cyou were right, and I was wrong, and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was wrong, you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we about to argue to see who\u2019s wrong and who\u2019s right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N laughed as she rolled her eyes, palms laying flat on her chest. \u201cLast night I thought a lot about what happened. You were only being protective of me, and at least you still loved me enough to even get jealous. Maybe in a few years you won\u2019t even care who I\u2019m with and I\u2019ll miss you being jealous all the time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not true.\u201d Harry grimaced when he heard her. \u201cI\u2019m always gonna care.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure? Maybe we\u2019ll go back to hating each other like we used to.\u201d She laughed between the words. But he knew somewhere behind her humor was something she was actually worried about.</p><p>Harry held her shoulders and leaned down a bit so their faces were at the same level, then he said, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you\u2019re great, Y/N, even back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d She snorted, making him shake his head to disagree.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. You only annoyed me because sometimes you made me soft and sentimental and I didn\u2019t like the fact that I liked it. Now I don\u2019t want anyone else to feel that way about you, <i>only me</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, baby.\u201d Y/N bit back a smile as she looked up at her boyfriend, but he jumped into her mouth before she could speak again.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t finished, Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>She huffed and told him to go on.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want you to know that you don\u2019t need to worry about Sage or any other women, because I don\u2019t even want anyone else. I\u2019ll love you no matter what and will always be overprotective when it comes to you, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was filled with love from hearing his little speech, and she swore she almost teared up in front of him. Luckily, she started beaming instead, definitely unable to stop now.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she said to him. \u201cYou have become waaaaaay too soft and sentimental.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d Harry grumbled as he pulled her in and kissed her forehead, knowing she\u2019d love him no matter what he became.</p></p>",

It could be just a look one guy gives her when they were at a social gathering, or the way one of their neighbors touched her arm too many times during a conversation.</p><p>Y/N had told him too often that he had got to trust her if they wanted their relationship to last, and he&rsquo;d also told her frequently that it wasn&rsquo;t her he didn&rsquo;t trust, it&rsquo;s them. The problem lied in the fact that she was so lovable that people fell for her very easily. She was kind, which was one of the many reasons why he loved her, but it got frustrating sometimes because many often mistaken kindness for affection.</p><p>It all began when their doorman Albert passed away and a replacement arrived only a day after that. This one was much younger than Albert, but still older than Harry and Y/N. Harry didn&rsquo;t know much about him, only that his name was Nam and he didn&rsquo;t say hello&hellip;to Harry at least. Albert used to say hello every time Harry entered the building. So his first impression about Nam was already bad.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t as good-looking as Harry (Harry thought so but he&rsquo;d also asked for Niall&rsquo;s opinion so he guessed that was fair), nor as funny (this, Niall had also confirmed, what a good friend), but somehow the old ladies in the building liked him a lot, probably because he gave out this positive vibe to everyone, well everyone <i>except </i>Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening, Y/N! Hello, Treasure!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as he followed his girlfriend, who was holding their kitty Treasure, towards the lift, feeling Nam&rsquo;s eyes lingered on them until they were finally out of his sight.</p><p>&ldquo;I fucking told you! He hates me!&rdquo; Harry breathed harshly once the door closed in front of them and the lift started moving up.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve never talked to him, H. You can&rsquo;t expect someone to be friendly to you if you always give them death glares,&rdquo; said Y/N as she smiled at her boyfriend. Treasure meowed to agree with her mum, leaving Harry on his own in this battle against their new doorman.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like Treasure has ever talked to him! She&rsquo;s a cat!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She plays with him all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry immediately furrowed his eyebrows at the cat. &ldquo;Daddy is very disappointed.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t say anything, just snorted and exited the lift when the door finally opened on the 10th floor. The couple get to their flat and Harry searched for the key in his girlfriend&rsquo;s bag, which he was carrying for her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being paranoid,&rdquo; he spoke while unlocking the door. &ldquo;You should have seen his face this morning when you left the building wearing that <i>incredibly </i>tight skirt. Well, <i>not </i>that I complain about that skirt, but it annoyed me how he didn&rsquo;t even try to be subtle.&rdquo;</p><p>As they entered, Y/N raised an eyebrow questioningly at her boyfriend. &ldquo;Was that why you suddenly gave me your trench coat? So he would stop staring at my bum?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but&hellip;&rdquo; He looked at her, trying to come up with a good reason but ends up saying, &ldquo;I also didn&rsquo;t want your bum to get cold.&rdquo;</p><p>His answer made Y/N chuckle and roll her eyes. Yes, Harry Styles everyone, the one and only man she&rsquo;d ever loved.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>A few days later, Harry came home and finds Y/N talking to their doorman. She was too busy laughing at something that man had just said and didn&rsquo;t even notice Harry&rsquo;s arrival.</p><p>Harry clenched his jaw and intended to walk over there to interrupt their conversation, when suddenly Nam reached out and ran his fingers through her hair, tucking a strand behind her ear like Harry normally did.</p><p><i>That</i> was the last straw.</p><p>Without thinking twice, Harry stormed towards his girlfriend and the other man as he called Y/N loudly by a loving nickname (because he can), which got her attention right away. Y/N smiled as soon as she saw him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re home early!&rdquo; She said, leaning in for a peck, but got completely startled when her boyfriend pulled her close and kissed her hard on the lips. Of course, normally Y/N would be more than willing to be kissed like <i>that</i>, but now she didn&rsquo;t feel very comfortable when her new friend was watching them. She slightly pushed him away, all out of breath and a bit confused too.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy to see me?&rdquo; She whispered with a soft smile, receiving one from Harry in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he answered shortly and grabbed her hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry completely ignored Nam&rsquo;s existence as he urged them both to leave, not giving Y/N a chance to say goodbye. That was when she realized what was going on there.</p><p>Once they&rsquo;d got into the lift, she turned to him, clearly annoyed. &ldquo;What was that all about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was touching your hair, Y/N. I should be the one to ask you that question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was being friendly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of friend run their fingers through their friend&rsquo;s hair? You don&rsquo;t see me do that to Layla or Trix! And Niall surely has never done that to you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine&hellip;I won&rsquo;t let him do that again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he replied, not looking at her, which didn&rsquo;t seem fine at all. So she moved closer and nudged his side with her elbow, raising an eyebrow.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;H, are you <i>really</i> fine?&rdquo; she laughed slightly when he kept a straight face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said after a moment, this time, looking at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Not mad at me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, you said you wouldn&rsquo;t let it happen again, and I trust you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N knew Harry too well, so even though she&rsquo;d heard him say those words loud and clear with her own ears, she still felt the need to ask for confirmation once again, you know, just in case.</p><p>&ldquo;You promise?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, pressing his lips into a small smile and she did too before bringing his face down to kiss him on the cheek. He had promised, so she believed him, and didn&rsquo;t think about it anymore&hellip;</p><p>&hellip;well&hellip;</p><p>&hellip;until the next day.</p><p>Y/N cane home the next day to find him already home. That was weird because he had never come home before she did. Something smelt fishy, and it was certainly not the fish he was cooking in the kitchen. It&rsquo;s the fact that he wasn&rsquo;t doing it <i>alone</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;What is<i> </i>she doing here?&rdquo; Y/N asked as she stayed at the kitchen door, startled by the presence of their catsitter/neighbor/the weird girl across the hall/Harry&rsquo;s <i>(not so secretive)</i> secret admirer who just happened to hate Y/N to the guts.</p><p>&ldquo;Sage&rsquo;s here to play with Treasure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? You&rsquo;re home, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Y/N raises an eyebrow and stared the other woman down until she turned away because it started to get uncomfortable. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s <i>not</i> playing with Treasure, she&rsquo;s cooking with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making dinner,&rdquo; Harry said and his choice of subject for that sentence irritated Y/N deeply.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She asserted, wiggling her fingers between him and herself. &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re</i> making dinner. Why is <i>she</i> here?&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as Y/N had made that question, the answer hit her right in the face. She widened her eyes at her boyfriend, who pretended to look confused, yet she knew exactly what his intention was.</p><p>&ldquo;How. Dare. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Harry shrugged, though she could swear he was well aware of what was going on there. The indifferent look on his face got on her nerves, so she immediately turned to their neighbor and requested Sage to leave her alone with her boyfriend.</p><p>The confused girl fixed her glasses, looking as puzzled as ever. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re in the midd&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ, just leave, Page, or I swear to God&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually<i> Sage</i>, but&hellip;okay&hellip;I&rsquo;m leaving!&rdquo; Sage raised both hands, still avoiding Y/N&rsquo;s eyes at all costs as she mumbled a goodbye to Harry and the cat before rushing out of their kitchen, and out of the flat.</p><p>Once she was long gone. Y/N turned back to Harry with a killer look on her face, letting him know he was now in deep, deep, <i>deep shit</i>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Un-<i>fucking</i>-believable!&rdquo; She began with a sarcastic laugh and slammed both hands down on the table, causing her man to flinch and swallow hard.</p><p>He looked frightened. <i>Good</i>, she thinks<i>. He should be!</i></p><p>&ldquo;You invited her here to get back at me, didn&rsquo;t you?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; he lied, crossing his arms as if this new position would make his words seem more believable. Y/N had known him too well and too long to not see what he was trying to do.</p><p>&ldquo;You did, Harry! I&rsquo;m so disappointed in you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you making a big deal out of this? I didn&rsquo;t let her touch my hair!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. My. God!&rdquo; Y/N exclaimed, holding her head with both hands in a dramatic manner, which freaked him out a bit to be honest. &ldquo;I fucking knew it! I FUCKING knew it! You did that to get back at me!&rdquo;</p><p><i>Okay, now she&rsquo;s really mad</i>, the little voice inside Harry&rsquo;s head told him. Y/N didn&rsquo;t get angry very often (thank God), but whenever she did.</p><p>She <i>did</i>.</p><p>Now the only thing inside his head was Justin Bieber singing, &rsquo;<i>is it too late now to say sorry?</i>&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unforgivable this time!&rdquo;</p><p><i>Okay, so it</i><b><i> is</i></b><i> too late to say sorry&hellip;</i></p><p>He could imagine smoke coming out of Y/N&rsquo;s head at the moment. Whatever he was going to say next, there was no way she would listen.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not only an immature little kid, but also a fucking liar! You promised me you would let this go but nooooo you still had to find a way to get back at me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But she did come here to see Treasure&hellip;&rdquo; Harry began, knowing it was a bad idea to speak, but not knowing why he did anyway.</p><p>Sage might have come here on her own but it was him who had asked her to stay and hang, because he had known it would piss Y/N off. So&hellip;he really was wrong, no matter how hard he tried to deny it to himself, or to his girlfriend who was clearly not in the mood for his useless explanations.</p><p>&ldquo;You knew she had been spreading false rumors about me, that she hated me, so you invited her here and played happy family, knowing I&rsquo;ll be upset! This is a competition to you, isn&rsquo;t it? You always have to win!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo; <i>She&rsquo;s right. Shut up.</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And not only that, you also brought Treasure into this! You are a terrible parent, Harry!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry looked at their kitty, who meowed to agree with Y/N, making him feel much worse. Maybe he&rsquo;d gone a bit far this time. Maybe his other baby hated him too.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;baby&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Y/N me. <i>You</i>&mdash;&rdquo; she pointed a finger at him &ldquo;&mdash;are sleeping on the sofa tonight.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Fuck</i>, he thought to himself when she stormed out of the kitchen and a loud door slam followed soon after that. Once silence sank in, Harry let out a sigh as he looked at the kitty who was already looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t hate me, right?&rdquo; He asked her.</p><p>However, just as he finished that sentence, she stood up on four feet and followed her mum out of the kitchen as well.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was getting late and Nam was drinking alone.</p><p>There weren&rsquo;t many guests entering and leaving the building anymore so nobody was going to report him for drinking during his shift. That was why he loved doing night shifts so much.</p><p>Nam was getting quite tipsy already when he heard the lift arrive on the ground floor. Harry stepped out into the lobby, wrapped around by a blanket. His eyes were weary and his hair a mess. He marched straight to the couch in the middle of the lobby and took off the weight of his body to land on the comfy piece of furniture.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna sleep there?&rdquo; Nam spoke up. &ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s against the rules.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure drinking while working is also against the rules.&rdquo; Harry yawned, not bothering to even look at Nam.</p><p>The doorman knew he&rsquo;d been caught, so he couldn&rsquo;t tell Harry to leave anymore. Instead, he walked over to the distressed young man and took a seat right next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Trouble in paradise?&rdquo; He asked, chuckling a bit at the grumpy look on Harry&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, I don&rsquo;t want to talk right now, especially to<i> you</i>, no offense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That hurts my feelings, dude.&rdquo;</p><p>If Harry hadn&rsquo;t been too tired, he would&rsquo;ve punched this man in the face. Lucky for Nam, he was exhausted. His girlfriend didn&rsquo;t let him into the bedroom, and his cat was sleeping on the couch so he had had no choice but to come down here, still better than sleeping on the floor.</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow at the doorman. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be happy Y/N and I are fighting?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would I be?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry snorted at the reply without saying anything else.</p><p>Suddenly, Nam leaned in closer. They almost shared a kiss when Harry pulled back just in time, even though he was very surprised by the other man&rsquo;s action.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Harry asked, eyebrows knitted together in confusion and shock, while Nam looked just as appalled, probably more. He quickly buried his face into his palms and groaned out loud, knowing it was very stupid of him to have made that attempt. He was drunk and hadn&rsquo;t been thinking straight (no pun intended), and Harry just looked so&hellip;<i>kissable</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you try to kiss me?&rdquo; Harry pointed a finger at himself, raising both eyebrows and his mouth was agape because he still couldn&rsquo;t believe what just happened, <i>happened</i>.</p><p>Nam shyly nodded his head and mumbled a small yes, along with an apology.</p><p>&ldquo;So you're&mdash;&rdquo; Harry paused a bit, squinting his eyes &ldquo;&mdash;not into Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>That question made the doorman laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? No! She&rsquo;s like a baby sister to me!&rdquo; Nam confessed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m into men&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Again?!&rdquo; Harry exclaimed, facepalming himself. Then he quickly noticed how offended Nam looked, so he had to explain, &ldquo;sorry&hellip;it&rsquo;s just&hellip;this happened once before&hellip;I thought someone else was also flirting with Y/N but he also told me he was gay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fun.&rdquo; Nam chuckles then immediately stopped when he saw Harry raising an eyebrow at him. &ldquo;Not that your girlfriend is not desirable&hellip;She&rsquo;s cute, she&rsquo;s just not&hellip;my type.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry sighed. Well, at least now he knew he was <i>half</i> right when he said Nam had been checking Y/N out, it just wasn&rsquo;t Y/N&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Does Y/N know about this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About me being gay or me being into you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She already knows I&rsquo;m gay. At first I wanted to talk to you but you intimidated me so I talked to her, but she seemed like a really nice person and I really like being her friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t tell her you liked me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not! But let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;ll be afraid of losing you to me, you&rsquo;re obviously into vag.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry breathed out a laugh for how Nam had just said that with a straight face.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Look, Y/N doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of friends. If she knows you were into me, she&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;re hanging out with her to get to me and not because you want to. I don&rsquo;t want her to be sad. So either if that is true or not, I&rsquo;d appreciate if you don&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nam smiled then patted Harry on the back. &ldquo;Y/N is a very lucky girl. And I&rsquo;m sorry I tried to kiss you. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was thinking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Harry smiled back tiredly, feeling kind of relief because even though his instinct was wrong once again, nobody else was after his girl.</p><p>However, she was still mad at him. So now he&rsquo;d have to wait until the morning came to return home and ask for her forgiveness.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Harry came back to their flat, he bumped right into Y/N the moment he opened the door. The first thing she did when she saw him was to wrap her arms around his torso, pulling him in for a tight hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Where have you been?! Oh God, I thought you left me!&rdquo; She said, which made him smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You took the bed and Treasure took the couch so I had to sleep in the lobby,&rdquo; he replied, holding her chin up and pressing his lips to hers. &ldquo;Also, I&rsquo;m very sorry about last night. You were right&hellip;I was so fucking immature.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m sorry too. I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone batshit crazy and yelled at you then locked you out.&rdquo; She frowned, holding his hands which are cupping her cheeks. &ldquo;I might go to hell for this, but there&rsquo;s something I need to tell you&hellip;Nam&hellip;he&rsquo;s&hellip;he&rsquo;s not really&hellip;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, he&mdash;&rdquo; Y/N halted immediately and widened her eyes when she realized what he had just said. &ldquo;Wait! How did you know?!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry released a soft laugh in reaction to the look on her face. &ldquo;He told me last night.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N immediately exhaled, laying one hand on her chest, just like a heavy weight had been lifted from it. &ldquo;He made me promise not to tell anyone, not even you. That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t tell you, but I couldn&rsquo;t risk having you think I was cheating on you or anything, so I had to&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes then interrupted her rambling by pressing his lips to hers, shutting her up with a kiss. It would be a lie if Y/N said she didn&rsquo;t wish he would do this more often. When they pulled away, it took almost three seconds to finally open her eyes.</p><p>He was smirking at her when he said, &ldquo;you were right, and I was wrong, and I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I was wrong, you were right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are we about to argue to see who&rsquo;s wrong and who&rsquo;s right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Y/N laughed as she rolled her eyes, palms laying flat on her chest. &ldquo;Last night I thought a lot about what happened. You were only being protective of me, and at least you still loved me enough to even get jealous. Maybe in a few years you won&rsquo;t even care who I&rsquo;m with and I&rsquo;ll miss you being jealous all the time.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo; Harry grimaced when he heard her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always gonna care.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How can you be so sure? Maybe we&rsquo;ll go back to hating each other like we used to.&rdquo; She laughed between the words. But he knew somewhere behind her humor was something she was actually worried about.</p><p>Harry held her shoulders and leaned down a bit so their faces were at the same level, then he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought you&rsquo;re great, Y/N, even back then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liar.&rdquo; She snorted, making him shake his head to disagree.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m serious. You only annoyed me because sometimes you made me soft and sentimental and I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that I liked it. Now I don&rsquo;t want anyone else to feel that way about you, <i>only me</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, baby.&rdquo; Y/N bit back a smile as she looked up at her boyfriend, but he jumped into her mouth before she could speak again.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t finished, Y/N.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She huffed and told him to go on.</p><p>&ldquo;And I want you to know that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about Sage or any other women, because I don&rsquo;t even want anyone else. I&rsquo;ll love you no matter what and will always be overprotective when it comes to you, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Her heart was filled with love from hearing his little speech, and she swore she almost teared up in front of him. Luckily, she started beaming instead, definitely unable to stop now.</p><p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;You have become waaaaaay too soft and sentimental.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; Harry grumbled as he pulled her in and kissed her forehead, knowing she&rsquo;d love him no matter what he became.</p></p>",

It could be just a look one guy gives her when they were at a social gathering, or the way one of their neighbors touched her arm too many times during a conversation.</p>\n<p>Y/N had told him too often that he had got to trust her if they wanted their relationship to last, and he&rsquo;d also told her frequently that it wasn&rsquo;t her he didn&rsquo;t trust, it&rsquo;s them. The problem lied in the fact that she was so lovable that people fell for her very easily. She was kind, which was one of the many reasons why he loved her, but it got frustrating sometimes because many often mistaken kindness for affection.</p>\n<p>It all began when their doorman Albert passed away and a replacement arrived only a day after that. This one was much younger than Albert, but still older than Harry and Y/N. Harry didn&rsquo;t know much about him, only that his name was Nam and he didn&rsquo;t say hello&hellip;to Harry at least. Albert used to say hello every time Harry entered the building. So his first impression about Nam was already bad.</p>\n<p>He wasn&rsquo;t as good-looking as Harry (Harry thought so but he&rsquo;d also asked for Niall&rsquo;s opinion so he guessed that was fair), nor as funny (this, Niall had also confirmed, what a good friend), but somehow the old ladies in the building liked him a lot, probably because he gave out this positive vibe to everyone, well everyone <i>except </i>Harry.</p>\n</p>",
