Fortunately for you, no one ever talked about it or even mentioned it again. </p><p>Or so you thought.</p><p>It\u2019s 6 am and you\u2019re getting ready to do your daily run with Sam when someone knocked on your door. You opened it and it revealed a very concerned Wanda who looks like she hasn\u2019t been getting much sleep lately. </p><p>\u201cUm, good morning?\u201d You greeted her and gestured her to come inside. \u201cSo&hellip;\u201d </p><p>She sat on the bed and sighed heavily. \u201cY/N, i\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You sat in a bean bag chair in front of her as you\u2019re putting on your running shoes. \u201cYou know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, the secret\u2019s out. So much for me trying to hide it. Hey, just a little tip. Don\u2019t write songs about your feelings. And definitely don\u2019t put them somewhere where Stark can easily snoop around.\u201d You chuckled, trying to make the atmosphere around you lighter, but she just looked at you with pity, and now all you want to do is curl up in a ball and cry. You cleared your throat. \u201cDoes everybody know already?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Although I think Steve\u2019s trying to piece it all together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s keep it that way. I don\u2019t want any more drama in my life. And I don\u2019t think he does, too.\u201d You stood up and started filling your water bottle with water. She scanned the papers containing the lyrics of your songs. \u201cBy \u2018he\u2019 you mean&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean Barnes.\u201d You turn around to her and glanced at the papers she\u2019s holding. You took a deep breath. This is hard. \u201cAnd Wanda?\u201d She turns to you with a confused look plastered on her face. \u201cRemind me to burn all that shit later.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>After your early run, you were called to a meeting by Fury. As you enter the conference room, you see everyone there already. Tony, Steve, Wanda, Sam, Bruce, Clint, Rhodey, Natasha and of course, Bucky. Thor was apparently not there because he had to go on another planet. You made your way beside Wanda.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t taken a shower yet? You smell.\u201d Clint joked and you flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start this meeting, shall we?\u201d Fury dropped the files that contains pictures from the security cameras of a S.H.I.E.L.D base and everyone started scanning them. \u201cHYDRA has infiltrated yet another S.H.I.E.L.D base in Siberia and it looks like they\u2019re getting smarter this time. One of the S.H.I.E.L.D agents that worked there turned out to be a mole and has been sending our files to HYDRA ever since.\u201d He dropped another picture in the center of the table and it was a familiar man going through one of the computers with a flash drive that has a skull logo on it. </p><p>\u201cHey, I know him.\u201d You looked at the picture closely. \u201cI used to train with him when I was just starting as a S.H.I.E.L.D agent. Rumlow, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>Fury nodded. \u201cIndeed, Y/N. Brock Rumlow. The mole who has been betraying us all this time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have to get to the S.H.I.E.L.D base and get rid of the HYDRA agents there and make sure to stop them from transferring our files to HYDRA, if they are still not finished with it yet. Some of our agents who were unable to escape are also hostaged.\u201d Fury continued. \u201cAnd I believe Rumlow is still there, so bring him to us, dead or alive.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it. We\u2019ll start packing up so we can leave immediately.\u201d Steve said as he was about to leave the room but Fury stopped him. </p><p>\u201cHold up, Cap. Not everyone is going. I\u2019m picking the ones who\u2019ll stay and the ones who\u2019ll go.\u201d He looked at the members of the team, trying to figure out who he\u2019s going to send in a deadly mission that could possibly cost them their life. \u201cTony, Bruce, Wanda, Rhodes and Sam, you guys stay. The rest will go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh, can I stay?\u201d You asked shyly. But if there\u2019s a way you could avoid Bucky and Nat, you\u2019d take it. \u201cI can help with Tony and the rest here to uh&hellip; guard, or something.\u201d </p><p><i>\u2018Or something\u2019</i>? You just wanna smack yourself in a head because that sounded very convincing.</p><p>Fury narrowed his brows and looked at you. \u201cNo, Y/L/N. You\u2019ll be going with Romanoff, Barnes, Rogers and Barton to the mission.\u201d You pouted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201c Fury cut you off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Y/N? You\u2019ve never turned down a mission before, especially when it\u2019s about HYDRA.\u201d </p><p>You gulped. Fury\u2019s getting suspicious and everyone\u2019s looking at you. You said you didn\u2019t want any more drama but drama wants you. </p><p>\u201cNevermind, sir.\u201d You looked down on your feet. God, you wish you were dead right now.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now you and the others who will be going on the mission, get ready. The quinjet will leave in an hour. Tony and Bruce, ready the earpieces and other gadgets they\u2019ll be needing. Dismissed.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 </p><p>As soon as the quinjet\u2019s door opened, all of you were flooded with gunshots by the HYDRA agents who were waiting outside. Steve and Clint were seperated from the group so you were left with the two people that you have been trying to avoid for a week now.</p><p>You tapped on the earpiece. \u201cSteve, Clint, are you guys alright?\u201d You said as you hold your gun up, checking all the hallways and corners after you successfully enter the base. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. We went to the other entrance.\u201d Clint\u2019s voice echoes on the earpiece.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better that we\u2019re seperated into two groups, that way, we can take down more HYDRA agents and get this over with.\u201d Steve said.</p><p>Your forehead furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean seperated? No no. Get your asses over here guys.\u201d You hear Clint\u2019s laugh on the other side. \u201cRelax, Y/N. Missed us already?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck off, Barton.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, HYDRA agents are coming.\u201d You turned when you heard what Natasha said, and sure enough, there\u2019s at least ten HYDRA agents coming your way.</p><p>You rolled your eyes and threw a big ball of fire at them. You gave it a few seconds then you walked over to the burnt agents, took back the fire and shot them all in the head. </p><p>\u201cWow. Y/N clearly has issues.\u201d You hear Tony\u2019s voice on your earpiece. You forgot that the team members who were left on the tower were watching you by the base\u2019s security cameras. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you, Stark, a therapist?\u201d You chuckled and he laughed. \u201cNot even close. But I know inner rage when I see one.\u201d </p><p>That made you speechless.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, I just wanna go home and finish this shit.\u201d You said and continued walking. You heard the couple shuffling behind you awkwardly, trying to catch up. You didn\u2019t look back at them.</p><p><i>Go home and finish this shit</i>, that\u2019s your goal for today. But that\u2019s not going to be easy, especially when you\u2019re surrounded by people who are trying to kill you. </p><p>You entered the room where all the computers are and you saw Rumlow in the middle, his eyes focused on the computer in front of him. You noticed the hard drive is still plugged in. Great, he\u2019s not finished yet.</p><p>\u201cRumlow.\u201d You said as you slowly walked over to him. </p><p>He just smiled devilishly. \u201cAhh, Y/N! Thought we\u2019d never see each other again after you became a superhero. Small world, right?\u201d </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"266\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/07a0adfcc53b8338af38370a8375dcbb/tumblr_pfank7ue0w1taj6s8_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"266\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>\u201cI\u2019ll smack you so hard you\u2019ll be out of this world in a second.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill as feisty as we first met, I like it.\u201d He chuckled and you just want to punch his vocal cords out of his body. \u201cYou know, I was going to recruit you as part of HYDRA before. We could\u2019ve been an amazing team.\u201d You started creating small balls of fire in your hands. \u201cYou really thought I would join you or even think about joining you? Then you must be dumber than I thought.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do, throw fire balls at me? I\u2019d like to see you try. You\u2019d just burn this place to the ground.\u201d He pointed his gun at you and you took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI will melt your face.\u201d You growled.</p><p>\u201cTry melting a bullet that\u2019s going 1, 700 miles per hour.\u201d And then he pulled the trigger.</p><p>You closed your eyes, waiting for the bullet to hit you, but it never did. You opened your eyes and you see Bucky laying on the ground, his shoulders already started to bleed.</p><p>\u201cOh&hellip; oh my god.\u201d You were in shock. You knelt down and held Bucky in your arms. \u201cBucky, what the fuck did you do?\u201d You started panicking, covering his wound with both of your hands.</p><p>You looked up and you see Rumlow take off his hard drive from the computer and ran outside. You don\u2019t know what to do. You either stay and keep Bucky from bleeding to death or you run after Rumlow.</p><p>Luckily, Natasha spoke behind you and said, \u201cI got Rumlow. Take care of Bucky.\u201d You turned to her and mouthed a \u2018thank you\u2019. She nodded and ran after Rumlow. </p><p>Your eyes went back to Bucky who\u2019s breathing heavily, struggling to keep his balance. </p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck did you do that, Barnes? That must be the stupidest thing you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d you said as you pulled out a piece of cloth that\u2019s sticking underneath a table and wrapped Bucky\u2019s shoulder with it.</p><p>\u201cI took a bullet for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fucking point, dickhead!\u201d </p><p>He chuckled softly. How you missed hearing that. \u201cI missed you cursing at me.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cWell you\u2019ll be getting more of that if you keep on doing dumb shit like that.\u201d You let him lean on the wall behind both of you. His eyes are slowly closing but you keep on slapping him gently in the face. \u201cKeep your damn eyes open, Barnes. You\u2019re not dying on me. And especially not in here.\u201d He smiled. \u201cGot it, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>There was silence as you put pressure on his shoulders to prevent it from bleeding even more. You bit your lip. You have so many questions to ask him and you didn\u2019t know what to ask first.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t speak immediately and you wait for an answer. He rest his head on the wall and closed his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just&hellip; don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA little too late for that.\u201d You looked down.</p><p>He lifted your head using his cold metal fingers and you looked at his mesmerizing, deep blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, doll.\u201d You looked away. You felt your eyes getting hot and your vision getting blurry. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking furious at you, you know that? You didn\u2019t even break up with me properly.\u201d You wiped the tears falling down on your cheeks. You hate being like this. You hate looking weak, especially in front of the person who hurt you pretty bad. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I&hellip;\u201d He sighed and looked directly in your eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to end. But you deserved better. Especially after that big fight we had before we left for the mission.\u201d You slowly removed your hands from his shoulders. Looks like the bleeding stopped, which is good. </p><p>You closed your eyes. You have thought of this moment in your head. You were ready for what to say when this moment comes. But now that you\u2019re right in front of him, suddenly a cat got your tongue. </p><p>\u201cFighting is normal in relationships, Buck. We said horrible things to each other, but breaking up without even talking about it is definitely not the way to fix it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, I realize that now. I\u2019m sorry, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry for everything.\u201d He wrapped his arms around your waist and buried his face into your neck. \u201cI\u2019m fucked up, and I really don\u2019t deserve you but I love you so much and I cannot physically and mentally live without you, doll.\u201d You heard him sob and you can\u2019t help but cry too. You were hurt but you just can\u2019t stay being mad at the love of your life. Even if he is fucked up. </p><p>But you realized something and slowly pushed him away. \u201cWhat about Nat? You were all over her ever since you came back from that mission.\u201d You said bitterly. \u201cNat and I, we were supposed to be just a one-night-stand. But I ended up making her my&hellip; what\u2019s that word in today\u2019s generation?\u201d You laughed. \u201cA rebound?\u201d He smiled and you can\u2019t help but get butterflies in your stomach. \u201cYes, rebound.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you still cheated on me and you\u2019re not gonna get away with it that easily.\u201d </p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cI know, doll and I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I was foolish and I promise I would never even dare to think about doing it again.\u201d He rest his forehead on yours and kissed the tip if your nose. \u201cI love you, darling. So much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPromise me also that when we have our hard times, you won\u2019t bail out immediately.\u201d You said as you intertwine your fingers with his. He held your hand up and kissed it. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Bucky felt like a heavy weight was lifted off his shoulders. He loves you more than he loves himself and he will make sure he won\u2019t ever try to hurt you again. But he could not believe it took a bullet to make him realize that. </p><p>Natasha came back but now, with Steve and Clint. You looked up at them and your cheeks started turning red. \u201cI&hellip; we&hellip; uh&hellip;\u201d You turned to Bucky. He just smiled and pulled you in for a kiss. Then turned to them. \u201cWe\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean back together?\u201d Clint grinned. You look at him with confusion plastered on your face. \u201cWait, you knew?\u201d Then you smacked yourself in the head, remembering what you did a week ago. \u201cWell, of course you knew. I just sang a song about him in front of everyone a week ago.\u201d </p><p>Steve chuckled. \u201cNo, Y/N. We knew even before you sang the song. It was obvious. How Bucky looks at you whenever you walk into the room, or how your smile is even wider when talking to him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOr even an easier explanation, we saw you two making out in the rooftop.\u201d Clint said and Steve glared at him. \u201cOops.\u201d </p><p>All of you just laughed. You couldn\u2019t believe they knew all this time. You looked at Bucky. \u201cWe\u2019re really not good at keeping secrets, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d You smiled and wrapped your arms around him. </p><p>You stood up and turned to Nat. \u201cNo hard feelings?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Come here, girl.\u201d She pulled you in and hugged you tight.</p><p>\u201cUh, hello? A person who just got shot here. Below.\u201d Bucky muttered and we laughed. Steve and Clint helped him stand up and get to the quinjet. </p><p>As soon as he sat down, he pulled you close and kissed you passionately. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>You smiled. \u201cI love you too, James Buchanan Barnes. All of you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh and doll?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should definitely write songs and sing to me more often.\u201d</p><p>~*~*~</p><p>And that\u2019s the end of this imagine!

Fortunately for you, no one ever talked about it or even mentioned it again. </p><p>Or so you thought.</p><p>It\u2019s 6 am and you\u2019re getting ready to do your daily run with Sam when someone knocked on your door. You opened it and it revealed a very concerned Wanda who looks like she hasn\u2019t been getting much sleep lately. </p><p>\u201cUm, good morning?\u201d You greeted her and gestured her to come inside. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d </p><p>She sat on the bed and sighed heavily. \u201cY/N, i\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You sat in a bean bag chair in front of her as you\u2019re putting on your running shoes. \u201cYou know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, the secret\u2019s out. So much for me trying to hide it. Hey, just a little tip. Don\u2019t write songs about your feelings. And definitely don\u2019t put them somewhere where Stark can easily snoop around.\u201d You chuckled, trying to make the atmosphere around you lighter, but she just looked at you with pity, and now all you want to do is curl up in a ball and cry. You cleared your throat. \u201cDoes everybody know already?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Although I think Steve\u2019s trying to piece it all together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s keep it that way. I don\u2019t want any more drama in my life. And I don\u2019t think he does, too.\u201d You stood up and started filling your water bottle with water. She scanned the papers containing the lyrics of your songs. \u201cBy \u2018he\u2019 you mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean Barnes.\u201d You turn around to her and glanced at the papers she\u2019s holding. You took a deep breath. This is hard. \u201cAnd Wanda?\u201d She turns to you with a confused look plastered on her face. \u201cRemind me to burn all that shit later.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>After your early run, you were called to a meeting by Fury. As you enter the conference room, you see everyone there already. Tony, Steve, Wanda, Sam, Bruce, Clint, Rhodey, Natasha and of course, Bucky. Thor was apparently not there because he had to go on another planet. You made your way beside Wanda.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t taken a shower yet? You smell.\u201d Clint joked and you flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start this meeting, shall we?\u201d Fury dropped the files that contains pictures from the security cameras of a S.H.I.E.L.D base and everyone started scanning them. \u201cHYDRA has infiltrated yet another S.H.I.E.L.D base in Siberia and it looks like they\u2019re getting smarter this time. One of the S.H.I.E.L.D agents that worked there turned out to be a mole and has been sending our files to HYDRA ever since.\u201d He dropped another picture in the center of the table and it was a familiar man going through one of the computers with a flash drive that has a skull logo on it. </p><p>\u201cHey, I know him.\u201d You looked at the picture closely. \u201cI used to train with him when I was just starting as a S.H.I.E.L.D agent. Rumlow, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>Fury nodded. \u201cIndeed, Y/N. Brock Rumlow. The mole who has been betraying us all this time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have to get to the S.H.I.E.L.D base and get rid of the HYDRA agents there and make sure to stop them from transferring our files to HYDRA, if they are still not finished with it yet. Some of our agents who were unable to escape are also hostaged.\u201d Fury continued. \u201cAnd I believe Rumlow is still there, so bring him to us, dead or alive.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it. We\u2019ll start packing up so we can leave immediately.\u201d Steve said as he was about to leave the room but Fury stopped him. </p><p>\u201cHold up, Cap. Not everyone is going. I\u2019m picking the ones who\u2019ll stay and the ones who\u2019ll go.\u201d He looked at the members of the team, trying to figure out who he\u2019s going to send in a deadly mission that could possibly cost them their life. \u201cTony, Bruce, Wanda, Rhodes and Sam, you guys stay. The rest will go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh, can I stay?\u201d You asked shyly. But if there\u2019s a way you could avoid Bucky and Nat, you\u2019d take it. \u201cI can help with Tony and the rest here to uh\u2026 guard, or something.\u201d </p><p><i>\u2018Or something\u2019</i>? You just wanna smack yourself in a head because that sounded very convincing.</p><p>Fury narrowed his brows and looked at you. \u201cNo, Y/L/N. You\u2019ll be going with Romanoff, Barnes, Rogers and Barton to the mission.\u201d You pouted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201c Fury cut you off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Y/N? You\u2019ve never turned down a mission before, especially when it\u2019s about HYDRA.\u201d </p><p>You gulped. Fury\u2019s getting suspicious and everyone\u2019s looking at you. You said you didn\u2019t want any more drama but drama wants you. </p><p>\u201cNevermind, sir.\u201d You looked down on your feet. God, you wish you were dead right now.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now you and the others who will be going on the mission, get ready. The quinjet will leave in an hour. Tony and Bruce, ready the earpieces and other gadgets they\u2019ll be needing. Dismissed.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 </p><p>As soon as the quinjet\u2019s door opened, all of you were flooded with gunshots by the HYDRA agents who were waiting outside. Steve and Clint were seperated from the group so you were left with the two people that you have been trying to avoid for a week now.</p><p>You tapped on the earpiece. \u201cSteve, Clint, are you guys alright?\u201d You said as you hold your gun up, checking all the hallways and corners after you successfully enter the base. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. We went to the other entrance.\u201d Clint\u2019s voice echoes on the earpiece.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better that we\u2019re seperated into two groups, that way, we can take down more HYDRA agents and get this over with.\u201d Steve said.</p><p>Your forehead furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean seperated? No no. Get your asses over here guys.\u201d You hear Clint\u2019s laugh on the other side. \u201cRelax, Y/N. Missed us already?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck off, Barton.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, HYDRA agents are coming.\u201d You turned when you heard what Natasha said, and sure enough, there\u2019s at least ten HYDRA agents coming your way.</p><p>You rolled your eyes and threw a big ball of fire at them. You gave it a few seconds then you walked over to the burnt agents, took back the fire and shot them all in the head. </p><p>\u201cWow. Y/N clearly has issues.\u201d You hear Tony\u2019s voice on your earpiece. You forgot that the team members who were left on the tower were watching you by the base\u2019s security cameras. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you, Stark, a therapist?\u201d You chuckled and he laughed. \u201cNot even close. But I know inner rage when I see one.\u201d </p><p>That made you speechless.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, I just wanna go home and finish this shit.\u201d You said and continued walking. You heard the couple shuffling behind you awkwardly, trying to catch up. You didn\u2019t look back at them.</p><p><i>Go home and finish this shit</i>, that\u2019s your goal for today. But that\u2019s not going to be easy, especially when you\u2019re surrounded by people who are trying to kill you. </p><p>You entered the room where all the computers are and you saw Rumlow in the middle, his eyes focused on the computer in front of him. You noticed the hard drive is still plugged in. Great, he\u2019s not finished yet.</p><p>\u201cRumlow.\u201d You said as you slowly walked over to him. </p><p>He just smiled devilishly. \u201cAhh, Y/N! Thought we\u2019d never see each other again after you became a superhero. Small world, right?\u201d </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"266\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/07a0adfcc53b8338af38370a8375dcbb/tumblr_pfank7ue0w1taj6s8_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"266\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>\u201cI\u2019ll smack you so hard you\u2019ll be out of this world in a second.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill as feisty as we first met, I like it.\u201d He chuckled and you just want to punch his vocal cords out of his body. \u201cYou know, I was going to recruit you as part of HYDRA before. We could\u2019ve been an amazing team.\u201d You started creating small balls of fire in your hands. \u201cYou really thought I would join you or even think about joining you? Then you must be dumber than I thought.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do, throw fire balls at me? I\u2019d like to see you try. You\u2019d just burn this place to the ground.\u201d He pointed his gun at you and you took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI will melt your face.\u201d You growled.</p><p>\u201cTry melting a bullet that\u2019s going 1, 700 miles per hour.\u201d And then he pulled the trigger.</p><p>You closed your eyes, waiting for the bullet to hit you, but it never did. You opened your eyes and you see Bucky laying on the ground, his shoulders already started to bleed.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 oh my god.\u201d You were in shock. You knelt down and held Bucky in your arms. \u201cBucky, what the fuck did you do?\u201d You started panicking, covering his wound with both of your hands.</p><p>You looked up and you see Rumlow take off his hard drive from the computer and ran outside. You don\u2019t know what to do. You either stay and keep Bucky from bleeding to death or you run after Rumlow.</p><p>Luckily, Natasha spoke behind you and said, \u201cI got Rumlow. Take care of Bucky.\u201d You turned to her and mouthed a \u2018thank you\u2019. She nodded and ran after Rumlow. </p><p>Your eyes went back to Bucky who\u2019s breathing heavily, struggling to keep his balance. </p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck did you do that, Barnes? That must be the stupidest thing you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d you said as you pulled out a piece of cloth that\u2019s sticking underneath a table and wrapped Bucky\u2019s shoulder with it.</p><p>\u201cI took a bullet for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fucking point, dickhead!\u201d </p><p>He chuckled softly. How you missed hearing that. \u201cI missed you cursing at me.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cWell you\u2019ll be getting more of that if you keep on doing dumb shit like that.\u201d You let him lean on the wall behind both of you. His eyes are slowly closing but you keep on slapping him gently in the face. \u201cKeep your damn eyes open, Barnes. You\u2019re not dying on me. And especially not in here.\u201d He smiled. \u201cGot it, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>There was silence as you put pressure on his shoulders to prevent it from bleeding even more. You bit your lip. You have so many questions to ask him and you didn\u2019t know what to ask first.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t speak immediately and you wait for an answer. He rest his head on the wall and closed his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just\u2026 don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA little too late for that.\u201d You looked down.</p><p>He lifted your head using his cold metal fingers and you looked at his mesmerizing, deep blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, doll.\u201d You looked away. You felt your eyes getting hot and your vision getting blurry. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking furious at you, you know that? You didn\u2019t even break up with me properly.\u201d You wiped the tears falling down on your cheeks. You hate being like this. You hate looking weak, especially in front of the person who hurt you pretty bad. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2026\u201d He sighed and looked directly in your eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to end. But you deserved better. Especially after that big fight we had before we left for the mission.\u201d You slowly removed your hands from his shoulders. Looks like the bleeding stopped, which is good. </p><p>You closed your eyes. You have thought of this moment in your head. You were ready for what to say when this moment comes. But now that you\u2019re right in front of him, suddenly a cat got your tongue. </p><p>\u201cFighting is normal in relationships, Buck. We said horrible things to each other, but breaking up without even talking about it is definitely not the way to fix it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, I realize that now. I\u2019m sorry, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry for everything.\u201d He wrapped his arms around your waist and buried his face into your neck. \u201cI\u2019m fucked up, and I really don\u2019t deserve you but I love you so much and I cannot physically and mentally live without you, doll.\u201d You heard him sob and you can\u2019t help but cry too. You were hurt but you just can\u2019t stay being mad at the love of your life. Even if he is fucked up. </p><p>But you realized something and slowly pushed him away. \u201cWhat about Nat? You were all over her ever since you came back from that mission.\u201d You said bitterly. \u201cNat and I, we were supposed to be just a one-night-stand. But I ended up making her my\u2026 what\u2019s that word in today\u2019s generation?\u201d You laughed. \u201cA rebound?\u201d He smiled and you can\u2019t help but get butterflies in your stomach. \u201cYes, rebound.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you still cheated on me and you\u2019re not gonna get away with it that easily.\u201d </p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cI know, doll and I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I was foolish and I promise I would never even dare to think about doing it again.\u201d He rest his forehead on yours and kissed the tip if your nose. \u201cI love you, darling. So much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPromise me also that when we have our hard times, you won\u2019t bail out immediately.\u201d You said as you intertwine your fingers with his. He held your hand up and kissed it. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Bucky felt like a heavy weight was lifted off his shoulders. He loves you more than he loves himself and he will make sure he won\u2019t ever try to hurt you again. But he could not believe it took a bullet to make him realize that. </p><p>Natasha came back but now, with Steve and Clint. You looked up at them and your cheeks started turning red. \u201cI\u2026 we\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d You turned to Bucky. He just smiled and pulled you in for a kiss. Then turned to them. \u201cWe\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean back together?\u201d Clint grinned. You look at him with confusion plastered on your face. \u201cWait, you knew?\u201d Then you smacked yourself in the head, remembering what you did a week ago. \u201cWell, of course you knew.

Fortunately for you, no one ever talked about it or even mentioned it again. </p><p>Or so you thought.</p><p>It\u2019s 6 am and you\u2019re getting ready to do your daily run with Sam when someone knocked on your door. You opened it and it revealed a very concerned Wanda who looks like she hasn\u2019t been getting much sleep lately. </p><p>\u201cUm, good morning?\u201d You greeted her and gestured her to come inside. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d </p><p>She sat on the bed and sighed heavily. \u201cY/N, i\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You sat in a bean bag chair in front of her as you\u2019re putting on your running shoes. \u201cYou know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, the secret\u2019s out. So much for me trying to hide it. Hey, just a little tip. Don\u2019t write songs about your feelings. And definitely don\u2019t put them somewhere where Stark can easily snoop around.\u201d You chuckled, trying to make the atmosphere around you lighter, but she just looked at you with pity, and now all you want to do is curl up in a ball and cry. You cleared your throat. \u201cDoes everybody know already?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Although I think Steve\u2019s trying to piece it all together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s keep it that way. I don\u2019t want any more drama in my life. And I don\u2019t think he does, too.\u201d You stood up and started filling your water bottle with water. She scanned the papers containing the lyrics of your songs. \u201cBy \u2018he\u2019 you mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean Barnes.\u201d You turn around to her and glanced at the papers she\u2019s holding. You took a deep breath. This is hard. \u201cAnd Wanda?\u201d She turns to you with a confused look plastered on her face. \u201cRemind me to burn all that shit later.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>After your early run, you were called to a meeting by Fury. As you enter the conference room, you see everyone there already. Tony, Steve, Wanda, Sam, Bruce, Clint, Rhodey, Natasha and of course, Bucky. Thor was apparently not there because he had to go on another planet. You made your way beside Wanda.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t taken a shower yet? You smell.\u201d Clint joked and you flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start this meeting, shall we?\u201d Fury dropped the files that contains pictures from the security cameras of a S.H.I.E.L.D base and everyone started scanning them. \u201cHYDRA has infiltrated yet another S.H.I.E.L.D base in Siberia and it looks like they\u2019re getting smarter this time. One of the S.H.I.E.L.D agents that worked there turned out to be a mole and has been sending our files to HYDRA ever since.\u201d He dropped another picture in the center of the table and it was a familiar man going through one of the computers with a flash drive that has a skull logo on it. </p><p>\u201cHey, I know him.\u201d You looked at the picture closely. \u201cI used to train with him when I was just starting as a S.H.I.E.L.D agent. Rumlow, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>Fury nodded. \u201cIndeed, Y/N. Brock Rumlow. The mole who has been betraying us all this time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have to get to the S.H.I.E.L.D base and get rid of the HYDRA agents there and make sure to stop them from transferring our files to HYDRA, if they are still not finished with it yet. Some of our agents who were unable to escape are also hostaged.\u201d Fury continued. \u201cAnd I believe Rumlow is still there, so bring him to us, dead or alive.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it. We\u2019ll start packing up so we can leave immediately.\u201d Steve said as he was about to leave the room but Fury stopped him. </p><p>\u201cHold up, Cap. Not everyone is going. I\u2019m picking the ones who\u2019ll stay and the ones who\u2019ll go.\u201d He looked at the members of the team, trying to figure out who he\u2019s going to send in a deadly mission that could possibly cost them their life. \u201cTony, Bruce, Wanda, Rhodes and Sam, you guys stay. The rest will go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh, can I stay?\u201d You asked shyly. But if there\u2019s a way you could avoid Bucky and Nat, you\u2019d take it. \u201cI can help with Tony and the rest here to uh\u2026 guard, or something.\u201d </p><p><i>\u2018Or something\u2019</i>? You just wanna smack yourself in a head because that sounded very convincing.</p><p>Fury narrowed his brows and looked at you. \u201cNo, Y/L/N. You\u2019ll be going with Romanoff, Barnes, Rogers and Barton to the mission.\u201d You pouted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201c Fury cut you off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Y/N? You\u2019ve never turned down a mission before, especially when it\u2019s about HYDRA.\u201d </p><p>You gulped. Fury\u2019s getting suspicious and everyone\u2019s looking at you. You said you didn\u2019t want any more drama but drama wants you. </p><p>\u201cNevermind, sir.\u201d You looked down on your feet. God, you wish you were dead right now.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now you and the others who will be going on the mission, get ready. The quinjet will leave in an hour. Tony and Bruce, ready the earpieces and other gadgets they\u2019ll be needing. Dismissed.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 </p><p>As soon as the quinjet\u2019s door opened, all of you were flooded with gunshots by the HYDRA agents who were waiting outside. Steve and Clint were seperated from the group so you were left with the two people that you have been trying to avoid for a week now.</p><p>You tapped on the earpiece. \u201cSteve, Clint, are you guys alright?\u201d You said as you hold your gun up, checking all the hallways and corners after you successfully enter the base. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. We went to the other entrance.\u201d Clint\u2019s voice echoes on the earpiece.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better that we\u2019re seperated into two groups, that way, we can take down more HYDRA agents and get this over with.\u201d Steve said.</p><p>Your forehead furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean seperated? No no. Get your asses over here guys.\u201d You hear Clint\u2019s laugh on the other side. \u201cRelax, Y/N. Missed us already?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck off, Barton.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, HYDRA agents are coming.\u201d You turned when you heard what Natasha said, and sure enough, there\u2019s at least ten HYDRA agents coming your way.</p><p>You rolled your eyes and threw a big ball of fire at them. You gave it a few seconds then you walked over to the burnt agents, took back the fire and shot them all in the head. </p><p>\u201cWow. Y/N clearly has issues.\u201d You hear Tony\u2019s voice on your earpiece. You forgot that the team members who were left on the tower were watching you by the base\u2019s security cameras. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you, Stark, a therapist?\u201d You chuckled and he laughed. \u201cNot even close. But I know inner rage when I see one.\u201d </p><p>That made you speechless.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, I just wanna go home and finish this shit.\u201d You said and continued walking. You heard the couple shuffling behind you awkwardly, trying to catch up. You didn\u2019t look back at them.</p><p><i>Go home and finish this shit</i>, that\u2019s your goal for today. But that\u2019s not going to be easy, especially when you\u2019re surrounded by people who are trying to kill you. </p><p>You entered the room where all the computers are and you saw Rumlow in the middle, his eyes focused on the computer in front of him. You noticed the hard drive is still plugged in. Great, he\u2019s not finished yet.</p><p>\u201cRumlow.\u201d You said as you slowly walked over to him. </p><p>He just smiled devilishly. \u201cAhh, Y/N! Thought we\u2019d never see each other again after you became a superhero. Small world, right?\u201d </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"266\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/07a0adfcc53b8338af38370a8375dcbb/tumblr_pfank7ue0w1taj6s8_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"266\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>\u201cI\u2019ll smack you so hard you\u2019ll be out of this world in a second.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill as feisty as we first met, I like it.\u201d He chuckled and you just want to punch his vocal cords out of his body. \u201cYou know, I was going to recruit you as part of HYDRA before. We could\u2019ve been an amazing team.\u201d You started creating small balls of fire in your hands. \u201cYou really thought I would join you or even think about joining you? Then you must be dumber than I thought.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do, throw fire balls at me? I\u2019d like to see you try. You\u2019d just burn this place to the ground.\u201d He pointed his gun at you and you took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI will melt your face.\u201d You growled.</p><p>\u201cTry melting a bullet that\u2019s going 1, 700 miles per hour.\u201d And then he pulled the trigger.</p><p>You closed your eyes, waiting for the bullet to hit you, but it never did. You opened your eyes and you see Bucky laying on the ground, his shoulders already started to bleed.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 oh my god.\u201d You were in shock. You knelt down and held Bucky in your arms. \u201cBucky, what the fuck did you do?\u201d You started panicking, covering his wound with both of your hands.</p><p>You looked up and you see Rumlow take off his hard drive from the computer and ran outside. You don\u2019t know what to do. You either stay and keep Bucky from bleeding to death or you run after Rumlow.</p><p>Luckily, Natasha spoke behind you and said, \u201cI got Rumlow. Take care of Bucky.\u201d You turned to her and mouthed a \u2018thank you\u2019. She nodded and ran after Rumlow. </p><p>Your eyes went back to Bucky who\u2019s breathing heavily, struggling to keep his balance. </p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck did you do that, Barnes? That must be the stupidest thing you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d you said as you pulled out a piece of cloth that\u2019s sticking underneath a table and wrapped Bucky\u2019s shoulder with it.</p><p>\u201cI took a bullet for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fucking point, dickhead!\u201d </p><p>He chuckled softly. How you missed hearing that. \u201cI missed you cursing at me.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cWell you\u2019ll be getting more of that if you keep on doing dumb shit like that.\u201d You let him lean on the wall behind both of you. His eyes are slowly closing but you keep on slapping him gently in the face. \u201cKeep your damn eyes open, Barnes. You\u2019re not dying on me. And especially not in here.\u201d He smiled. \u201cGot it, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>There was silence as you put pressure on his shoulders to prevent it from bleeding even more. You bit your lip. You have so many questions to ask him and you didn\u2019t know what to ask first.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t speak immediately and you wait for an answer. He rest his head on the wall and closed his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just\u2026 don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA little too late for that.\u201d You looked down.</p><p>He lifted your head using his cold metal fingers and you looked at his mesmerizing, deep blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, doll.\u201d You looked away. You felt your eyes getting hot and your vision getting blurry. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking furious at you, you know that? You didn\u2019t even break up with me properly.\u201d You wiped the tears falling down on your cheeks. You hate being like this. You hate looking weak, especially in front of the person who hurt you pretty bad. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2026\u201d He sighed and looked directly in your eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to end. But you deserved better. Especially after that big fight we had before we left for the mission.\u201d You slowly removed your hands from his shoulders. Looks like the bleeding stopped, which is good. </p><p>You closed your eyes. You have thought of this moment in your head. You were ready for what to say when this moment comes. But now that you\u2019re right in front of him, suddenly a cat got your tongue. </p><p>\u201cFighting is normal in relationships, Buck. We said horrible things to each other, but breaking up without even talking about it is definitely not the way to fix it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, I realize that now. I\u2019m sorry, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry for everything.\u201d He wrapped his arms around your waist and buried his face into your neck. \u201cI\u2019m fucked up, and I really don\u2019t deserve you but I love you so much and I cannot physically and mentally live without you, doll.\u201d You heard him sob and you can\u2019t help but cry too. You were hurt but you just can\u2019t stay being mad at the love of your life. Even if he is fucked up. </p><p>But you realized something and slowly pushed him away. \u201cWhat about Nat? You were all over her ever since you came back from that mission.\u201d You said bitterly. \u201cNat and I, we were supposed to be just a one-night-stand. But I ended up making her my\u2026 what\u2019s that word in today\u2019s generation?\u201d You laughed. \u201cA rebound?\u201d He smiled and you can\u2019t help but get butterflies in your stomach. \u201cYes, rebound.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you still cheated on me and you\u2019re not gonna get away with it that easily.\u201d </p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cI know, doll and I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I was foolish and I promise I would never even dare to think about doing it again.\u201d He rest his forehead on yours and kissed the tip if your nose. \u201cI love you, darling. So much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPromise me also that when we have our hard times, you won\u2019t bail out immediately.\u201d You said as you intertwine your fingers with his. He held your hand up and kissed it. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Bucky felt like a heavy weight was lifted off his shoulders. He loves you more than he loves himself and he will make sure he won\u2019t ever try to hurt you again. But he could not believe it took a bullet to make him realize that. </p><p>Natasha came back but now, with Steve and Clint. You looked up at them and your cheeks started turning red. \u201cI\u2026 we\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d You turned to Bucky. He just smiled and pulled you in for a kiss. Then turned to them. \u201cWe\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean back together?\u201d Clint grinned. You look at him with confusion plastered on your face. \u201cWait, you knew?\u201d Then you smacked yourself in the head, remembering what you did a week ago. \u201cWell, of course you knew. I just sang a song about him in front of everyone a week ago.\u201d </p><p>Steve chuckled. \u201cNo, Y/N. We knew even before you sang the song. It was obvious. How Bucky looks at you whenever you walk into the room, or how your smile is even wider when talking to him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOr even an easier explanation, we saw you two making out in the rooftop.\u201d Clint said and Steve glared at him. \u201cOops.\u201d </p><p>All of you just laughed. You couldn\u2019t believe they knew all this time. You looked at Bucky. \u201cWe\u2019re really not good at keeping secrets, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d You smiled and wrapped your arms around him. </p><p>You stood up and turned to Nat. \u201cNo hard feelings?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Come here, girl.\u201d She pulled you in and hugged you tight.</p><p>\u201cUh, hello? A person who just got shot here. Below.\u201d Bucky muttered and we laughed. Steve and Clint helped him stand up and get to the quinjet. </p><p>As soon as he sat down, he pulled you close and kissed you passionately. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>You smiled. \u201cI love you too, James Buchanan Barnes. All of you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh and doll?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should definitely write songs and sing to me more often.\u201d</p><p>~*~*~</p><p>And that\u2019s the end of this imagine! Hope you liked it guys. I will do more soon, and you can send requests if you want!</p></p>",

You&rsquo;ll be going with Romanoff, Barnes, Rogers and Barton to the mission.&rdquo; You pouted. &ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo; Fury cut you off.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Y/N? You&rsquo;ve never turned down a mission before, especially when it&rsquo;s about HYDRA.&rdquo; </p><p>You gulped. Fury&rsquo;s getting suspicious and everyone&rsquo;s looking at you. You said you didn&rsquo;t want any more drama but drama wants you. </p><p>&ldquo;Nevermind, sir.&rdquo; You looked down on your feet. God, you wish you were dead right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Now you and the others who will be going on the mission, get ready. The quinjet will leave in an hour. Tony and Bruce, ready the earpieces and other gadgets they&rsquo;ll be needing. Dismissed.&rdquo; </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; </p><p>As soon as the quinjet&rsquo;s door opened, all of you were flooded with gunshots by the HYDRA agents who were waiting outside. Steve and Clint were seperated from the group so you were left with the two people that you have been trying to avoid for a week now.</p><p>You tapped on the earpiece. &ldquo;Steve, Clint, are you guys alright?&rdquo; You said as you hold your gun up, checking all the hallways and corners after you successfully enter the base. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine. We went to the other entrance.&rdquo; Clint&rsquo;s voice echoes on the earpiece.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s better that we&rsquo;re seperated into two groups, that way, we can take down more HYDRA agents and get this over with.&rdquo; Steve said.</p><p>Your forehead furrowed. &ldquo;What do you mean seperated? No no. Get your asses over here guys.&rdquo; You hear Clint&rsquo;s laugh on the other side. &ldquo;Relax, Y/N. Missed us already?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off, Barton.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, HYDRA agents are coming.&rdquo; You turned when you heard what Natasha said, and sure enough, there&rsquo;s at least ten HYDRA agents coming your way.</p><p>You rolled your eyes and threw a big ball of fire at them. You gave it a few seconds then you walked over to the burnt agents, took back the fire and shot them all in the head. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow. Y/N clearly has issues.&rdquo; You hear Tony&rsquo;s voice on your earpiece. You forgot that the team members who were left on the tower were watching you by the base&rsquo;s security cameras. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you, Stark, a therapist?&rdquo; You chuckled and he laughed. &ldquo;Not even close. But I know inner rage when I see one.&rdquo; </p><p>That made you speechless.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever, I just wanna go home and finish this shit.&rdquo; You said and continued walking. You heard the couple shuffling behind you awkwardly, trying to catch up. You didn&rsquo;t look back at them.</p><p><i>Go home and finish this shit</i>, that&rsquo;s your goal for today. But that&rsquo;s not going to be easy, especially when you&rsquo;re surrounded by people who are trying to kill you. </p><p>You entered the room where all the computers are and you saw Rumlow in the middle, his eyes focused on the computer in front of him. You noticed the hard drive is still plugged in. Great, he&rsquo;s not finished yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Rumlow.&rdquo; You said as you slowly walked over to him. </p><p>He just smiled devilishly. &ldquo;Ahh, Y/N! Thought we&rsquo;d never see each other again after you became a superhero. Small world, right?&rdquo; </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/07a0adfcc53b8338af38370a8375dcbb/tumblr_pfank7ue0w1taj6s8_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll smack you so hard you&rsquo;ll be out of this world in a second.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Still as feisty as we first met, I like it.&rdquo; He chuckled and you just want to punch his vocal cords out of his body. &ldquo;You know, I was going to recruit you as part of HYDRA before. We could&rsquo;ve been an amazing team.&rdquo; You started creating small balls of fire in your hands. &ldquo;You really thought I would join you or even think about joining you? Then you must be dumber than I thought.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What are you gonna do, throw fire balls at me? I&rsquo;d like to see you try. You&rsquo;d just burn this place to the ground.&rdquo; He pointed his gun at you and you took a step back.</p><p>&ldquo;I will melt your face.&rdquo; You growled.</p><p>&ldquo;Try melting a bullet that&rsquo;s going 1, 700 miles per hour.&rdquo; And then he pulled the trigger.</p><p>You closed your eyes, waiting for the bullet to hit you, but it never did. You opened your eyes and you see Bucky laying on the ground, his shoulders already started to bleed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; oh my god.&rdquo; You were in shock. You knelt down and held Bucky in your arms. &ldquo;Bucky, what the fuck did you do?&rdquo; You started panicking, covering his wound with both of your hands.</p><p>You looked up and you see Rumlow take off his hard drive from the computer and ran outside. You don&rsquo;t know what to do. You either stay and keep Bucky from bleeding to death or you run after Rumlow.</p><p>Luckily, Natasha spoke behind you and said, &ldquo;I got Rumlow. Take care of Bucky.&rdquo; You turned to her and mouthed a &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;. She nodded and ran after Rumlow. </p><p>Your eyes went back to Bucky who&rsquo;s breathing heavily, struggling to keep his balance. </p><p>&ldquo;Why the fuck did you do that, Barnes? That must be the stupidest thing you&rsquo;ve ever done.&rdquo; you said as you pulled out a piece of cloth that&rsquo;s sticking underneath a table and wrapped Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder with it.</p><p>&ldquo;I took a bullet for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fucking point, dickhead!&rdquo; </p><p>He chuckled softly. How you missed hearing that. &ldquo;I missed you cursing at me.&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. &ldquo;Well you&rsquo;ll be getting more of that if you keep on doing dumb shit like that.&rdquo; You let him lean on the wall behind both of you. His eyes are slowly closing but you keep on slapping him gently in the face. &ldquo;Keep your damn eyes open, Barnes. You&rsquo;re not dying on me. And especially not in here.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;Got it, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p><p>There was silence as you put pressure on his shoulders to prevent it from bleeding even more. You bit your lip. You have so many questions to ask him and you didn&rsquo;t know what to ask first.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t speak immediately and you wait for an answer. He rest his head on the wall and closed his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I just&hellip; don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A little too late for that.&rdquo; You looked down.</p><p>He lifted your head using his cold metal fingers and you looked at his mesmerizing, deep blue eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, doll.&rdquo; You looked away. You felt your eyes getting hot and your vision getting blurry. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking furious at you, you know that? You didn&rsquo;t even break up with me properly.&rdquo; You wiped the tears falling down on your cheeks. You hate being like this. You hate looking weak, especially in front of the person who hurt you pretty bad. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I&hellip;&rdquo; He sighed and looked directly in your eyes. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want us to end. But you deserved better. Especially after that big fight we had before we left for the mission.&rdquo; You slowly removed your hands from his shoulders. Looks like the bleeding stopped, which is good. </p><p>You closed your eyes. You have thought of this moment in your head. You were ready for what to say when this moment comes. But now that you&rsquo;re right in front of him, suddenly a cat got your tongue. </p><p>&ldquo;Fighting is normal in relationships, Buck. We said horrible things to each other, but breaking up without even talking about it is definitely not the way to fix it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know, I realize that now. I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N. I&rsquo;m sorry for everything.&rdquo; He wrapped his arms around your waist and buried his face into your neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fucked up, and I really don&rsquo;t deserve you but I love you so much and I cannot physically and mentally live without you, doll.&rdquo; You heard him sob and you can&rsquo;t help but cry too. You were hurt but you just can&rsquo;t stay being mad at the love of your life. Even if he is fucked up. </p><p>But you realized something and slowly pushed him away. &ldquo;What about Nat? You were all over her ever since you came back from that mission.&rdquo; You said bitterly. &ldquo;Nat and I, we were supposed to be just a one-night-stand. But I ended up making her my&hellip; what&rsquo;s that word in today&rsquo;s generation?&rdquo; You laughed. &ldquo;A rebound?&rdquo; He smiled and you can&rsquo;t help but get butterflies in your stomach. &ldquo;Yes, rebound.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, you still cheated on me and you&rsquo;re not gonna get away with it that easily.&rdquo; </p><p>He sighed heavily. &ldquo;I know, doll and I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. I was foolish and I promise I would never even dare to think about doing it again.&rdquo; He rest his forehead on yours and kissed the tip if your nose. &ldquo;I love you, darling. So much.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Promise me also that when we have our hard times, you won&rsquo;t bail out immediately.&rdquo; You said as you intertwine your fingers with his. He held your hand up and kissed it. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky felt like a heavy weight was lifted off his shoulders. He loves you more than he loves himself and he will make sure he won&rsquo;t ever try to hurt you again. But he could not believe it took a bullet to make him realize that. </p><p>Natasha came back but now, with Steve and Clint. You looked up at them and your cheeks started turning red. &ldquo;I&hellip; we&hellip; uh&hellip;&rdquo; You turned to Bucky. He just smiled and pulled you in for a kiss. Then turned to them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean back together?&rdquo; Clint grinned. You look at him with confusion plastered on your face. &ldquo;Wait, you knew?&rdquo; Then you smacked yourself in the head, remembering what you did a week ago. &ldquo;Well, of course you knew. I just sang a song about him in front of everyone a week ago.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve chuckled. &ldquo;No, Y/N. We knew even before you sang the song. It was obvious. How Bucky looks at you whenever you walk into the room, or how your smile is even wider when talking to him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Or even an easier explanation, we saw you two making out in the rooftop.&rdquo; Clint said and Steve glared at him. &ldquo;Oops.&rdquo; </p><p>All of you just laughed. You couldn&rsquo;t believe they knew all this time. You looked at Bucky. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really not good at keeping secrets, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; You smiled and wrapped your arms around him. </p><p>You stood up and turned to Nat. &ldquo;No hard feelings?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Come here, girl.&rdquo; She pulled you in and hugged you tight.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, hello? A person who just got shot here. Below.&rdquo; Bucky muttered and we laughed. Steve and Clint helped him stand up and get to the quinjet. </p><p>As soon as he sat down, he pulled you close and kissed you passionately. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled. &ldquo;I love you too, James Buchanan Barnes. All of you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh and doll?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should definitely write songs and sing to me more often.&rdquo;</p><p>~*~*~</p><p>And that&rsquo;s the end of this imagine! Hope you liked it guys. I will do more soon, and you can send requests if you want!</p></p>",

Or something like that.\n\nThis is my little Tumbler blog - I created it in order to properly follow all the OTHER Tumblrs I love, and it was supposed to be the lil'brother of my \"proper blog\".\n\nHowever, it took a life of its own and for a while it was my main blog. These days I'm mostly at Instagram but most of my art-related posts get reblogged here as well.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/figueiredojames/\n\nWanna ask me something, feel free to hit the \"ask\" button!\n\nBest,\nJ.",

Sorry, Carol, but Monica will always be the greatest character to bear the title in my mind. #captainmarvel #spectrum #photon #avengers #marvelcomics #monicarambeau #fanart #inktober #latergram<br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn5nmzZg5fg/?utm_source=ig_tumblr_share&amp;igshid=ezmy6ovja2r8\">https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn5nmzZg5fg/?utm_source=ig_tumblr_share&amp;igshid=ezmy6ovja2r8</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>Y\u2019all, we\u2019re getting close. Only two chapters left. I like where 13 ended, so there won\u2019t be an epilogue, but I\u2019d be up for some drabbles if anyone wants to request them.</p><p>I read a post somewhere about how in fics Steve always works stuff out, but in actual MCU cannon he really just ignores his feelings and hopes they\u2019ll go away. (Really wish I could link it; if someone knows what I\u2019m talking about, shoot me the link so I can!) I tried to bridge the gap between those two in how I resolved last week\u2019s cliffhanger (since, let\u2019s be honest, resolution is necessary for the forwarding of the plot).</p><p>Also, since I finished the actual writing this story part already, I missed writing for my boy Steve and had to start another series. Look for\u00a0\u201cRebound\u201d October 3rd!</p><p><b>Word count:</b>\u00a01439</p><p><b>Warnings:</b>\u00a0Steve being Steve and avoiding stuff, so angst. A bit of fluff. Build-up for the next chapter, but not a bad cliffhanger.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to notice that something had changed\nbetween the two of you. Steve had become less affectionate, avoiding physical\ncontact and no longer seeking you out during the day. Natasha had continued as\nyour trainer, but you wished he would at least be there for your lessons. Since\nthe day after the last HYDRA attack, however, you had hardly seen him despite\nsharing a bedroom.</p><!-- more --><p>The rest of the team noticed as well. It was Nat who\nconfronted him first, bringing you up in conversation during a sparring\nsession.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the two of you?\u201d she asked, dropping\ndown to dodge his punch and sweeping out a leg.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He jumped over her\nleg but stumbled as she leapt onto his back.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Rogers. I know you better than that.\u201d She\nflipped him as he tried to shake her off and ended up under him on the floor,\nlegs around his neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding Y/N for more than a week now. The\nwhole team has noticed. She\u2019s wilting. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong, but you\u2019d\nbetter fix it.\u201d</p><p>He tapped out and they both stood. Steve avoided her eyes as\nhe replied, \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let me put it this way.\u201d Nat jabbed her finger\ninto Steve\u2019s chest. \u201cFix it or I\u2019ll break your kneecaps. I like Y/N and she\ndoesn\u2019t deserve this. You know she doesn\u2019t.\u201d She grabbed her water bottle and\nheaded for the door. \u201cTalk to her, Rogers. Today.\u201d</p><p>But in typical Steve fashion, he kept ignoring the problem.\nThe whole thing was messing with your emotions; you kept leaving a trail of\nEMP\u2019d electronics in your wake and you could no longer use your phone. A couple\ndays later, you had finally had enough and tracked him down in the gym.</p><p>\u201cSteve, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even look up from where he was working over the\npunching bag. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you said, bracing yourself on the other side of the\nbag, \u201cwe do.\u201d</p><p>He paused and wiped the back of his hand across his brow.\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>You threw your hands up in exasperation. \u201cAbout whatever the\nhell is going on with you that makes you think ignoring me for weeks is okay!\u201d</p><p>Steve punched the bag again, forcing you to grab on to keep\nit from knocking you over. \u201cHaven\u2019t been ignoring you. Just busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bull and you know it.\u201d You finally reached up and\nunclipped the bag, dropping it to the floor. Steve reached to hook it back up\nbut your hand on his arm stopped him. He finally locked his eyes with yours and\nwas surprised to find compassion there.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2019s wrong, we can handle it together,\u201d you said\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it.\u201d His voice broke. \u201cYou, me\u2026 we shouldn\u2019t be\ntogether. I\u2019m just too selfish to let you go.\u201d</p><p>You froze for a moment before running your palm up his arm\nto cup his cheek. \u201cNow, who says,\u201d you whispered, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be together,\nand do I get a say in this?\u201d</p><p>He leaned into your hand, desperate to feel you after the\nweeks apart.</p><p>\u201cI heard your conversation with Tony the morning after you\nwere last attacked, about you wanting a house and kids and a normal life. I\ncan\u2019t give you all of that, Y/N. No matter how much I want to, I can\u2019t give you\na life that\u2019s anywhere near normal.\u201d</p><p>You pulled his head down and Steve let himself be lost in\nthe kiss, feeling hollow when you finally pulled away for air.</p><p>\u201cAnd not once, this whole time, did you think to ask me if I\nwanted you to?\u201d He looked confused, so you continued. \u201cI told you when we first\nmet what I wanted to do for a career. I had other plans, too. Visit London\nsomeday. Pay rent. Buy a goldfish.\u201d He smiled sadly but you continued. \u201cBut\nthen I met this blond with the prettiest blue eyes I\u2019ve ever seen and a smile\nthat simultaneously stops my heart and makes it beat twice as quickly. Steve,\u201d\nyou brought his eyes back up to yours, \u201cafter meeting you, <i>you</i> became what I wanted. I had a bad day and for a few hours, I\nwanted my old life back, but never, <i>never</i>,\nhave I regretted you. That ad was the best thing that ever happened to me, and\ndon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>Steve wrapped his right arm around your waist, bringing his\nleft hand up to move your palm from his cheek to his mouth so he could kiss it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me, too,\u201d he whispered, tears\nslowly falling from his eyes.</p><p>You pressed a chaste kiss to his lips before wrapping him in\na hug. \u201cYou really need to work on your communication skills, Captain,\u201d you\nmumbled into his chest.</p><p>At that, he barked out a laugh. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>Despite working things out with Steve, your life didn\u2019t get\nany easier. Your senior year classes were hard, and you missed interacting with\nother students; Tony had set up a space for you to video conference all your\nclasses, since the threat of another HYDRA attack had the team confining you to\nthe tower. Working at your job was out as well, so you\u2019d reluctantly tendered\nyour resignation.

Buy a goldfish.\u201d He smiled sadly but you continued. \u201cBut\nthen I met this blond with the prettiest blue eyes I\u2019ve ever seen and a smile\nthat simultaneously stops my heart and makes it beat twice as quickly. Steve,\u201d\nyou brought his eyes back up to yours, \u201cafter meeting you, <i>you</i> became what I wanted. I had a bad day and for a few hours, I\nwanted my old life back, but never, <i>never</i>,\nhave I regretted you. That ad was the best thing that ever happened to me, and\ndon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>Steve wrapped his right arm around your waist, bringing his\nleft hand up to move your palm from his cheek to his mouth so he could kiss it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me, too,\u201d he whispered, tears\nslowly falling from his eyes.</p><p>You pressed a chaste kiss to his lips before wrapping him in\na hug. \u201cYou really need to work on your communication skills, Captain,\u201d you\nmumbled into his chest.</p><p>At that, he barked out a laugh. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.

Your senior year classes were hard, and you missed interacting with\nother students; Tony had set up a space for you to video conference all your\nclasses, since the threat of another HYDRA attack had the team confining you to\nthe tower. Working at your job was out as well, so you\u2019d reluctantly tendered\nyour resignation. Training with Natasha continued of course, and you could\nalmost hold your own by now, but you were definitely feeling bored, and you\nmade the mistake of mentioning that to Tony.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Tony, I just remembered I have a paper due\ntomorrow that I really need to finish \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Lady Spangles, this\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>You shot Tony a glare that went entirely unnoticed. \u201cYou\u2019re\nexperimenting on me. How dangerous is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m experimenting <i>with\n</i>you; there\u2019s a difference. Besides, there are safety protocols in place for\nevery contingency.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s reassuring voice spoke. \u201cOdds of you being\ninjured, Ms. Y/L/N, are almost non-existent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least that\u2019s somewhat comforting,\u201d you mumbled.\nLouder, you asked, \u201cWhat happens if any of the protocols fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf safety protocols fail, anything could happen, ranging\nfrom slight discomfort to paralysis and death.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes grew wide at F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s admission. \u201cTony, what\nare you planning on doing to me?\u201d</p><p>He ignored your stare and kept moving stuff around on his\nholo screens. \u201cJust a little something that might help us really unlock that\nEMP thing you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d you warned, \u201cdon\u2019t even go there. I have no idea\nhow to control it; it just comes out when I\u2019m more emotional than normal. If\nyou, as you say, \u2018unlock\u2019 it, who knows what will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where these come in,\u201d Tony said, proudly producing a\nheadband and two gloves. \u201cI styled the gloves so they were visually similar to\nmy repulsors, but I used Cap\u2019s color scheme. We can tweak the look however you\nwant once we know it works.\u201d</p><p>You studied the pieces as he passed them to you. \u201cHow are\nthese supposed to work, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a lot of scientific mumbo-jumbo I could say\nto that,\u201d Tony said as he began helping you put the gear on, \u201cbut the gist of\nit is that the headband emits waves that stimulate your brain to produce an\nEMP, but only release it through your hands. The gloves will focus the energy\u2019s\ndirection. It\u2019s all based on nanotechnology like my suit, so it responds to\nyour thoughts. Just aim and think about releasing it through your right hand,\nyada yada yada.\u201d Stepping back, he pressed play on a remote and a big band jazz\nensemble filled the air and motioned to the speakers set out in the middle of\nthe open floor. \u201cGo on, try it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already designed the gear, your heart told you, so why\nnot give it a try? Your brain came back with everything that could possibly go\nwrong. It only took a moment for the excitement in your heart to win. You\nlifted your right hand and thought about silencing the music.</p><p>The speaker you had aimed at shook a little as the EMP hit\nit dead on.

Steve had become less affectionate, avoiding physical\ncontact and no longer seeking you out during the day. Natasha had continued as\nyour trainer, but you wished he would at least be there for your lessons. Since\nthe day after the last HYDRA attack, however, you had hardly seen him despite\nsharing a bedroom.</p><p>The rest of the team noticed as well. It was Nat who\nconfronted him first, bringing you up in conversation during a sparring\nsession.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with the two of you?&rdquo; she asked, dropping\ndown to dodge his punch and sweeping out a leg.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; He jumped over her\nleg but stumbled as she leapt onto his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut the crap, Rogers. I know you better than that.&rdquo; She\nflipped him as he tried to shake her off and ended up under him on the floor,\nlegs around his neck. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been avoiding Y/N for more than a week now. The\nwhole team has noticed. She&rsquo;s wilting. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong, but you&rsquo;d\nbetter fix it.&rdquo;</p><p>He tapped out and they both stood. Steve avoided her eyes as\nhe replied, &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right, let me put it this way.&rdquo; Nat jabbed her finger\ninto Steve&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;Fix it or I&rsquo;ll break your kneecaps. I like Y/N and she\ndoesn&rsquo;t deserve this. You know she doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She grabbed her water bottle and\nheaded for the door. &ldquo;Talk to her, Rogers. Today.&rdquo;</p><p>But in typical Steve fashion, he kept ignoring the problem.\nThe whole thing was messing with your emotions; you kept leaving a trail of\nEMP&rsquo;d electronics in your wake and you could no longer use your phone. A couple\ndays later, you had finally had enough and tracked him down in the gym.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve, we need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t even look up from where he was working over the\npunching bag. &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you said, bracing yourself on the other side of the\nbag, &ldquo;we do.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused and wiped the back of his hand across his brow.\n&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p><p>You threw your hands up in exasperation. &ldquo;About whatever the\nhell is going on with you that makes you think ignoring me for weeks is okay!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve punched the bag again, forcing you to grab on to keep\nit from knocking you over. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been ignoring you. Just busy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bull and you know it.&rdquo; You finally reached up and\nunclipped the bag, dropping it to the floor. Steve reached to hook it back up\nbut your hand on his arm stopped him. He finally locked his eyes with yours and\nwas surprised to find compassion there.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s wrong, we can handle it together,&rdquo; you said\nsoftly.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it.&rdquo; His voice broke. &ldquo;You, me&hellip; we shouldn&rsquo;t be\ntogether. I&rsquo;m just too selfish to let you go.&rdquo;</p><p>You froze for a moment before running your palm up his arm\nto cup his cheek. &ldquo;Now, who says,&rdquo; you whispered, &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t be together,\nand do I get a say in this?&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned into your hand, desperate to feel you after the\nweeks apart.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard your conversation with Tony the morning after you\nwere last attacked, about you wanting a house and kids and a normal life.
