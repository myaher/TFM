You already finished grading those papers?\u201d</p><p>Oksana hemmed and hawed in between kissing her way down Eve\u2019s neck. \u201cWell&hellip;not quite. It\u2019s just that I swear my half of the papers were the longer ones. Your\u2019s were like five pages and mine were all ten pages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, I\u2019m pretty sure you just have a tendency to be distractible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find you distracting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly,\u201d Eve commented, as Oksana nuzzled at her neck.</p><p>\u201cI had to come to bed before you fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>Eve did her best not to be swayed by Oksana\u2019s dopey, big eyed expression. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them back tomorrow, they need to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get up early and finish them. I really only have a couple left.\u201d Eve attempted to give Oksana her best stern look, but Oksana just grinned. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t want to fall asleep without me.\u201d</p><p>Eve couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>\u201cFine. Just promise me you\u2019ll wake up early enough to get them done. And I won\u2019t have to help you at five in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Oksana told her. \u201cLook, I\u2019m setting an alarm right now.\u201d She sat back on Eve\u2019s hips and grabbed her phone, setting the alarm and showing it to Eve.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eve said. Satisfied, she looped her hands behind Oksana\u2019s neck and pulled her down for a kiss. Oksana didn\u2019t actually end up getting to sleep any earlier than she would have if she\u2019d stayed up to do the papers, but it wasn\u2019t like either of them had expected that to happen.</p><p>\u2014\u2014&ndash;</p><p><i>The final exam for Dr. Polastri and Dr. Astankova\u2019s class was optional, the students had the choice to taken it if they wanted to replace one of their lowest exam or paper grades. \u00a0Final papers had been due a week before the start of final exams and they were getting them back on the last day of class so they\u2019d have a chance to decide if they wanted to take the exam two days after.</i></p><p><i>The students were anxiously awaiting the grades. For all the fun and games, it was a hard class, worth every minute and every bit of effort, but it was a hard class. Exam questions required real thought and there had yet to be a paper that could be done in a rush the night before. The comments on the discussion forums about the professors\u2019 relationship had fell to the background in favor of more frenetic 3am questions clarifying important concepts the night before an exam. Long-term bets still stood, of course, but for the most part the students had more pressing concerns.</i></p><p><i>The day they were supposed to get the papers back was a weird one from the very start. The normal spring weather that had brought consistently bright blue skies and warm sunshine at the beginning of each morning was gone. It was gray and cool and people found themselves pulling jackets out of their closets for the first time in almost two months.</i></p><p><i>The weather set a very appropriate mood for the arrival of the two professors. It was a good ten minutes past the start of class and neither of them had arrived, a unique occurence. Dr. Polastri had been known to occasionally arrive late when she taught classes alone, but even then was generally fairly punctual and rarely more than a few minutes behind on the occasions she was late. Dr. Astankova had never been known to be late and it had seemed to rub off on her colleague once they were teaching together. They were always in the lecture hall already when the students arrived, Dr. Astankova bright and cheery, Dr. Polastri sipping coffee.</i></p><p><i>So, ten minutes was more than pushing it and when the doors finally slammed open, just about every person in the room jumped. The doors were oak, large and heavy, typical of the old buildings on campus. The force with which Dr. Polastri would have had to throw herself against them to achieve such a sound was impressive; the look on her face perfectly matching the crash of them hitting the wall. Dr. Astankova trailed in after her, dressed in nothing close to her usual extravagance. She looked guilty and exhausted and her shoulders sagged. She waited by the door her arms crossed over her chest, staring blankly at a trash can in the corner.</i></p><p><i>Dr. Polastri dropped her bag on the table with another loud thud and pressed her hands down on its surface with a huge sigh. She closed her eyes and waited like that for several long moments that ticked by with a silence that hung heavy over the room. Everyone had frozen the moment they\u2019d heard the door slam. No one spoke. What could anyone possibly have said?</i></p><p><i>Finally, Dr. Polastri raised her head and clapped her hands together. Barely containing the exasperation in her voice, she informed them that the grading of the papers was not complete. Some of the papers were done, but it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to hand back some of them, if not everyone could get theirs back. She apologized for the inconvenience, especially given the final exam in two days and promised that some arrangements would be made to get the papers back as soon as possible. Her fingers clenched and unclenched as she spoke and every muscle in her face was tight.</i></p><p><i>There was something strange about the way she spoke, apart from the tension in her voice. It hadn\u2019t been noticeable until it changed, but up until that point the two professors had talked almost exclusively in terms of \u201cwe\u201d when discussing class business. \u201cWe want to remind you that the test is next week.\u201d \u201cWe&rsquo;ll be posting a study guide on the class website.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have your graded papers back by the end of the week.\u201d Dr. Polastri hadn\u2019t used \u201cwe\u201d at all and every \u201cI\u201d that came out of her mouth was spat like it tasted foul on her tongue.</i></p><p><i>Dr. Astankova continued to stand by the door staring at the trashcan, shoulders slumped forward.</i></p><p><i>\u201cClass is over.\u201d Dr. Polastri announced, barely controlling the anger in her voice. She grabbed her bag and walked back toward Dr. Astankova, where she came to a halt and hissed in her ear. Clearly, it was only intended to be between the two of them, but her voice carried over the first several rows. \u201cMeet me in my office. Now.\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Eve whirled on Oksana as soon as the office door fell shut behind them and her face was flurry of emotion, anger topping the list.</p><p>\u201cExplain to me how this happened. I wake up this morning, twenty minutes before class starts, not having set an alarm because I assumed you would have woken me up given that you were going to get up hours before me. But no! You\u2019re still sprawled out asleep next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Oksana whispered, looking at her feet.</p><p>\u201cSo I drag you out of bed and into the car because of course we\u2019re already going to be late at that point. And I\u2019m not really thinking because I\u2019m half asleep and frazzled but eventually the thought of the papers gets through my head and I figure that you must have gone back to bed after you finished them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oksana mumbled, but Eve just carried on.</p><p>\u201cBut no! You never even got up! You hadn\u2019t done any of them! What were you thinking, Oksana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;I wasn\u2019t. I just heard the alarm go off and I was tired and I turned it off half asleep and&hellip;I don\u2019t know&hellip;We got to sleep really late and&hellip;\u201d Oksana stumbled over her words, twisting her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. That\u2019s one thing. But you lied to me! You didn\u2019t just have a couple left, you had dozens, Oksana! You lied!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie, I was just mistaken about how many!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let me down. You let the students down. You made us both look incompetent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake! It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always like this, though. You put things off, you don\u2019t take things seriously. I can\u2019t count on you.\u201d</p><p>Oksana looked like she had been punched in the gut. She stared at Eve for several long moments with her mouth slightly open and her lips starting to tremble. Then she turned and walked out the door.</p><p>Late that night, Eve sat huddled in the recliner by the front door, waiting for Oksana to come home. The bright green numbers on the clock changed slowly, much slower than it seemed like they should. Eve\u2019s head felt like it was full of cotton and there was a huge weight in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She\u2019d started several text messages to Oksana but had ultimately deleted them, never able to quite figure out what she wanted to say. So, she just left the phone on the arm of the chair, volume on high, and hoped Oksana would be able to find her words.</p><p>Around midnight Eve went and made herself a cup of tea. It felt wrong; Oksana usually made tea for her. Eve would put the water on to boil and set out the mugs and Oksana would measure out the exact right amount of tea into the little metal balls. Eve couldn\u2019t even remember what they were called. Oksana was really particular about it, very specific about the exact amount of leaves compared to the amount of water and how long it steeped for. She\u2019d pick different types for Eve based on how Eve was feeling or what kind of day she\u2019d had or what she\u2019d eaten most recently.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel right to make herself. It was bitter on her tongue and not just because she\u2019d done a bad job making it. Eve dumped it down the sink in frustration and returned to the recliner, returned to staring at the clock.</p><p>At some point she fell asleep and in the early hours of the morning, she woke up to a quiet house. She stood up stiffly and made her way down to the bedroom, slipping in as quietly as she could.</p><p>The bed was cold and unslept in. She was alone.</p>",

You already finished grading those papers?\u201d</p><p>Oksana hemmed and hawed in between kissing her way down Eve\u2019s neck. \u201cWell\u2026not quite. It\u2019s just that I swear my half of the papers were the longer ones. Your\u2019s were like five pages and mine were all ten pages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, I\u2019m pretty sure you just have a tendency to be distractible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find you distracting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly,\u201d Eve commented, as Oksana nuzzled at her neck.</p><p>\u201cI had to come to bed before you fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>Eve did her best not to be swayed by Oksana\u2019s dopey, big eyed expression. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them back tomorrow, they need to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get up early and finish them. I really only have a couple left.\u201d Eve attempted to give Oksana her best stern look, but Oksana just grinned. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t want to fall asleep without me.\u201d</p><p>Eve couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>\u201cFine. Just promise me you\u2019ll wake up early enough to get them done. And I won\u2019t have to help you at five in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Oksana told her. \u201cLook, I\u2019m setting an alarm right now.\u201d She sat back on Eve\u2019s hips and grabbed her phone, setting the alarm and showing it to Eve.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eve said. Satisfied, she looped her hands behind Oksana\u2019s neck and pulled her down for a kiss. Oksana didn\u2019t actually end up getting to sleep any earlier than she would have if she\u2019d stayed up to do the papers, but it wasn\u2019t like either of them had expected that to happen.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p><i>The final exam for Dr. Polastri and Dr. Astankova\u2019s class was optional, the students had the choice to taken it if they wanted to replace one of their lowest exam or paper grades. \u00a0Final papers had been due a week before the start of final exams and they were getting them back on the last day of class so they\u2019d have a chance to decide if they wanted to take the exam two days after.</i></p><p><i>The students were anxiously awaiting the grades. For all the fun and games, it was a hard class, worth every minute and every bit of effort, but it was a hard class. Exam questions required real thought and there had yet to be a paper that could be done in a rush the night before. The comments on the discussion forums about the professors\u2019 relationship had fell to the background in favor of more frenetic 3am questions clarifying important concepts the night before an exam. Long-term bets still stood, of course, but for the most part the students had more pressing concerns.</i></p><p><i>The day they were supposed to get the papers back was a weird one from the very start. The normal spring weather that had brought consistently bright blue skies and warm sunshine at the beginning of each morning was gone. It was gray and cool and people found themselves pulling jackets out of their closets for the first time in almost two months.</i></p><p><i>The weather set a very appropriate mood for the arrival of the two professors. It was a good ten minutes past the start of class and neither of them had arrived, a unique occurence. Dr. Polastri had been known to occasionally arrive late when she taught classes alone, but even then was generally fairly punctual and rarely more than a few minutes behind on the occasions she was late. Dr. Astankova had never been known to be late and it had seemed to rub off on her colleague once they were teaching together. They were always in the lecture hall already when the students arrived, Dr. Astankova bright and cheery, Dr. Polastri sipping coffee.</i></p><p><i>So, ten minutes was more than pushing it and when the doors finally slammed open, just about every person in the room jumped. The doors were oak, large and heavy, typical of the old buildings on campus. The force with which Dr. Polastri would have had to throw herself against them to achieve such a sound was impressive; the look on her face perfectly matching the crash of them hitting the wall. Dr. Astankova trailed in after her, dressed in nothing close to her usual extravagance. She looked guilty and exhausted and her shoulders sagged. She waited by the door her arms crossed over her chest, staring blankly at a trash can in the corner.</i></p><p><i>Dr. Polastri dropped her bag on the table with another loud thud and pressed her hands down on its surface with a huge sigh. She closed her eyes and waited like that for several long moments that ticked by with a silence that hung heavy over the room. Everyone had frozen the moment they\u2019d heard the door slam. No one spoke. What could anyone possibly have said?</i></p><p><i>Finally, Dr. Polastri raised her head and clapped her hands together. Barely containing the exasperation in her voice, she informed them that the grading of the papers was not complete. Some of the papers were done, but it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to hand back some of them, if not everyone could get theirs back. She apologized for the inconvenience, especially given the final exam in two days and promised that some arrangements would be made to get the papers back as soon as possible. Her fingers clenched and unclenched as she spoke and every muscle in her face was tight.</i></p><p><i>There was something strange about the way she spoke, apart from the tension in her voice. It hadn\u2019t been noticeable until it changed, but up until that point the two professors had talked almost exclusively in terms of \u201cwe\u201d when discussing class business. \u201cWe want to remind you that the test is next week.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be posting a study guide on the class website.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have your graded papers back by the end of the week.\u201d Dr. Polastri hadn\u2019t used \u201cwe\u201d at all and every \u201cI\u201d that came out of her mouth was spat like it tasted foul on her tongue.</i></p><p><i>Dr. Astankova continued to stand by the door staring at the trashcan, shoulders slumped forward.</i></p><p><i>\u201cClass is over.\u201d Dr. Polastri announced, barely controlling the anger in her voice. She grabbed her bag and walked back toward Dr. Astankova, where she came to a halt and hissed in her ear. Clearly, it was only intended to be between the two of them, but her voice carried over the first several rows. \u201cMeet me in my office. Now.\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Eve whirled on Oksana as soon as the office door fell shut behind them and her face was flurry of emotion, anger topping the list.</p><p>\u201cExplain to me how this happened. I wake up this morning, twenty minutes before class starts, not having set an alarm because I assumed you would have woken me up given that you were going to get up hours before me. But no! You\u2019re still sprawled out asleep next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Oksana whispered, looking at her feet.</p><p>\u201cSo I drag you out of bed and into the car because of course we\u2019re already going to be late at that point. And I\u2019m not really thinking because I\u2019m half asleep and frazzled but eventually the thought of the papers gets through my head and I figure that you must have gone back to bed after you finished them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oksana mumbled, but Eve just carried on.</p><p>\u201cBut no! You never even got up! You hadn\u2019t done any of them! What were you thinking, Oksana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I wasn\u2019t. I just heard the alarm go off and I was tired and I turned it off half asleep and\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026We got to sleep really late and\u2026\u201d Oksana stumbled over her words, twisting her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. That\u2019s one thing. But you lied to me! You didn\u2019t just have a couple left, you had dozens, Oksana! You lied!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie, I was just mistaken about how many!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let me down. You let the students down. You made us both look incompetent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake! It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always like this, though. You put things off, you don\u2019t take things seriously. I can\u2019t count on you.\u201d</p><p>Oksana looked like she had been punched in the gut. She stared at Eve for several long moments with her mouth slightly open and her lips starting to tremble. Then she turned and walked out the door.</p><p>Late that night, Eve sat huddled in the recliner by the front door, waiting for Oksana to come home. The bright green numbers on the clock changed slowly, much slower than it seemed like they should. Eve\u2019s head felt like it was full of cotton and there was a huge weight in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She\u2019d started several text messages to Oksana but had ultimately deleted them, never able to quite figure out what she wanted to say. So, she just left the phone on the arm of the chair, volume on high, and hoped Oksana would be able to find her words.</p><p>Around midnight Eve went and made herself a cup of tea. It felt wrong; Oksana usually made tea for her. Eve would put the water on to boil and set out the mugs and Oksana would measure out the exact right amount of tea into the little metal balls. Eve couldn\u2019t even remember what they were called. Oksana was really particular about it, very specific about the exact amount of leaves compared to the amount of water and how long it steeped for. She\u2019d pick different types for Eve based on how Eve was feeling or what kind of day she\u2019d had or what she\u2019d eaten most recently.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel right to make herself. It was bitter on her tongue and not just because she\u2019d done a bad job making it. Eve dumped it down the sink in frustration and returned to the recliner, returned to staring at the clock.</p><p>At some point she fell asleep and in the early hours of the morning, she woke up to a quiet house. She stood up stiffly and made her way down to the bedroom, slipping in as quietly as she could.</p><p>The bed was cold and unslept in. She was alone.</p>",

Oksana didn\u2019t actually end up getting to sleep any earlier than she would have if she\u2019d stayed up to do the papers, but it wasn\u2019t like either of them had expected that to happen.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p><i>The final exam for Dr. Polastri and Dr. Astankova\u2019s class was optional, the students had the choice to taken it if they wanted to replace one of their lowest exam or paper grades. \u00a0Final papers had been due a week before the start of final exams and they were getting them back on the last day of class so they\u2019d have a chance to decide if they wanted to take the exam two days after.</i></p><p><i>The students were anxiously awaiting the grades. For all the fun and games, it was a hard class, worth every minute and every bit of effort, but it was a hard class. Exam questions required real thought and there had yet to be a paper that could be done in a rush the night before. The comments on the discussion forums about the professors\u2019 relationship had fell to the background in favor of more frenetic 3am questions clarifying important concepts the night before an exam. Long-term bets still stood, of course, but for the most part the students had more pressing concerns.</i></p><p><i>The day they were supposed to get the papers back was a weird one from the very start. The normal spring weather that had brought consistently bright blue skies and warm sunshine at the beginning of each morning was gone. It was gray and cool and people found themselves pulling jackets out of their closets for the first time in almost two months.</i></p><p><i>The weather set a very appropriate mood for the arrival of the two professors. It was a good ten minutes past the start of class and neither of them had arrived, a unique occurence. Dr. Polastri had been known to occasionally arrive late when she taught classes alone, but even then was generally fairly punctual and rarely more than a few minutes behind on the occasions she was late. Dr. Astankova had never been known to be late and it had seemed to rub off on her colleague once they were teaching together. They were always in the lecture hall already when the students arrived, Dr. Astankova bright and cheery, Dr. Polastri sipping coffee.</i></p><p><i>So, ten minutes was more than pushing it and when the doors finally slammed open, just about every person in the room jumped. The doors were oak, large and heavy, typical of the old buildings on campus. The force with which Dr. Polastri would have had to throw herself against them to achieve such a sound was impressive; the look on her face perfectly matching the crash of them hitting the wall. Dr. Astankova trailed in after her, dressed in nothing close to her usual extravagance. She looked guilty and exhausted and her shoulders sagged. She waited by the door her arms crossed over her chest, staring blankly at a trash can in the corner.</i></p><p><i>Dr. Polastri dropped her bag on the table with another loud thud and pressed her hands down on its surface with a huge sigh. She closed her eyes and waited like that for several long moments that ticked by with a silence that hung heavy over the room. Everyone had frozen the moment they\u2019d heard the door slam. No one spoke. What could anyone possibly have said?</i></p><p><i>Finally, Dr. Polastri raised her head and clapped her hands together. Barely containing the exasperation in her voice, she informed them that the grading of the papers was not complete. Some of the papers were done, but it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to hand back some of them, if not everyone could get theirs back. She apologized for the inconvenience, especially given the final exam in two days and promised that some arrangements would be made to get the papers back as soon as possible. Her fingers clenched and unclenched as she spoke and every muscle in her face was tight.</i></p><p><i>There was something strange about the way she spoke, apart from the tension in her voice. It hadn\u2019t been noticeable until it changed, but up until that point the two professors had talked almost exclusively in terms of \u201cwe\u201d when discussing class business. \u201cWe want to remind you that the test is next week.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be posting a study guide on the class website.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have your graded papers back by the end of the week.\u201d Dr. Polastri hadn\u2019t used \u201cwe\u201d at all and every \u201cI\u201d that came out of her mouth was spat like it tasted foul on her tongue.</i></p><p><i>Dr. Astankova continued to stand by the door staring at the trashcan, shoulders slumped forward.</i></p><p><i>\u201cClass is over.\u201d Dr. Polastri announced, barely controlling the anger in her voice. She grabbed her bag and walked back toward Dr. Astankova, where she came to a halt and hissed in her ear. Clearly, it was only intended to be between the two of them, but her voice carried over the first several rows. \u201cMeet me in my office. Now.\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Eve whirled on Oksana as soon as the office door fell shut behind them and her face was flurry of emotion, anger topping the list.</p><p>\u201cExplain to me how this happened. I wake up this morning, twenty minutes before class starts, not having set an alarm because I assumed you would have woken me up given that you were going to get up hours before me. But no! You\u2019re still sprawled out asleep next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Oksana whispered, looking at her feet.</p><p>\u201cSo I drag you out of bed and into the car because of course we\u2019re already going to be late at that point. And I\u2019m not really thinking because I\u2019m half asleep and frazzled but eventually the thought of the papers gets through my head and I figure that you must have gone back to bed after you finished them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oksana mumbled, but Eve just carried on.</p><p>\u201cBut no! You never even got up! You hadn\u2019t done any of them! What were you thinking, Oksana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I wasn\u2019t. I just heard the alarm go off and I was tired and I turned it off half asleep and\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026We got to sleep really late and\u2026\u201d Oksana stumbled over her words, twisting her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. That\u2019s one thing. But you lied to me! You didn\u2019t just have a couple left, you had dozens, Oksana! You lied!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie, I was just mistaken about how many!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let me down. You let the students down. You made us both look incompetent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake! It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always like this, though. You put things off, you don\u2019t take things seriously. I can\u2019t count on you.\u201d</p><p>Oksana looked like she had been punched in the gut. She stared at Eve for several long moments with her mouth slightly open and her lips starting to tremble. Then she turned and walked out the door.</p><p>Late that night, Eve sat huddled in the recliner by the front door, waiting for Oksana to come home. The bright green numbers on the clock changed slowly, much slower than it seemed like they should. Eve\u2019s head felt like it was full of cotton and there was a huge weight in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She\u2019d started several text messages to Oksana but had ultimately deleted them, never able to quite figure out what she wanted to say. So, she just left the phone on the arm of the chair, volume on high, and hoped Oksana would be able to find her words.</p><p>Around midnight Eve went and made herself a cup of tea. It felt wrong; Oksana usually made tea for her. Eve would put the water on to boil and set out the mugs and Oksana would measure out the exact right amount of tea into the little metal balls. Eve couldn\u2019t even remember what they were called. Oksana was really particular about it, very specific about the exact amount of leaves compared to the amount of water and how long it steeped for. She\u2019d pick different types for Eve based on how Eve was feeling or what kind of day she\u2019d had or what she\u2019d eaten most recently.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel right to make herself. It was bitter on her tongue and not just because she\u2019d done a bad job making it. Eve dumped it down the sink in frustration and returned to the recliner, returned to staring at the clock.</p><p>At some point she fell asleep and in the early hours of the morning, she woke up to a quiet house. She stood up stiffly and made her way down to the bedroom, slipping in as quietly as she could.</p><p>The bed was cold and unslept in. She was alone.</p>",
