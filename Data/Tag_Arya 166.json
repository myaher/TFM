He didn\u2019t want to leave her while she slept, but first light would come soon, and Gendry could not be caught in the Princess\u2019s bed. Her leg lays across his stomach, and every time she moves, the smooth inside of her thigh slides across his hip. Her body bare except for the thin linen that drapes across their hips. Her head is on his arm, but most of her body rests on his side, and presses her breasts against his ribs. She shifts again, and her leg ventures lower. </p><p>Her body had small scars all over, but the insides of her thighs were soft. The outsides were just as scarred as the rest of her body. He mindlessly rubbed his hand on her back, and felt some of her scars from the House of Black and White. Her arms had healed cuts from various things, but he loved the mark on her face the most. She had fallen out of a tree as a child, and split her lip open, leaving a faint scar that led up to her nostril. He tries not to despise the scars that mark her stomach, but it\u2019s hard. She says they\u2019re ugly, and he knows she\u2019s self-conscious of them every time she removes her clothes for him, so he\u2019s sure to hide the fury he feels when he sees them. They could have killed her. They almost did. Unlike the scars that littered her body to teach her lessons for losing her balance while climbing a tree or not paying close enough attention to the end of a blade while fighting. But the scars on her belly only showed that she had failed to obey an order to kill someone underserving of death. She murmurs something to Gendry and he doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s waking or sleep talking. She slides her leg across his stomach, resting it just below his belly button. Her hair, which she still keeps short (albeit neatly cut to reach her shoulders) had tangled from the early events of this morning and fell across her face. A chunk stuck to the corner of her mouth and moves a little which each breath she withdraws. Gendry smiles softly and brushes it away from her face. She hums in response, finally stirring from her sleep. She opens her eyes and huffs a little. </p><p>\u201cMorning, already?\u201d She mumbles, and he smiles again at her sleepy state. </p><p>\u201cYou can sleep for a while longer, I need to get back to the forge,\u201d he whispers, trying not to rouse her too much. </p><p>\u201cHave you slept?\u201d She asks, shutting her eyes again and snuggling her face against Gendry\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cNo, I was going to sleep for a little while at the forge before everyone wakes up,\u201d he says, and he knows she\u2019s probably rolling her eyes at him under his chin. The war against the Night King had ended, but Cersei Lannister still wanted Jon and Daenerys\u2019s heads on spikes for trying to rebel against her claim to the throne. And they needed weapons to win. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just sleep here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have the King in the North and his wolf catch me? I think not, m\u2019lady.\u201d She groans in response to the nickname. \u201cOh, right, my apologies, <i>Your Grace</i>,\u201d he teases and she shoves his chest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the princess, stupid. Sansa is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I checked, having a brother for a King makes you a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many princesses do you know of that invite men into their beds,\u201d she snaps, and he lets out a small chuckle. </p><p>\u201c<i>Men</i>? I hope you don\u2019t mean more than me,\u201d he teases and she smiles against his throat. She hums. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops, you weren\u2019t supposed to know about my many lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now that you\u2019ve told me they exist, I have to know who I\u2019m fighting for your affections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she leans up from her spot and rests her head on her hand. \u201cThere\u2019s Podrick&hellip; Samwell&hellip; my brother\u2019s wife Meera&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cBronn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim, too,\u201d she jests. \u201cAnd Jaime Lannister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must say, Your Grace, you are quite the little scoundrel of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone had to be,\u201d she gives him a smile, one that was reserved for him in private. When she trained in Braavos she learned to hide her emotions, but the only one that she couldn\u2019t control around Gendry was love. </p><p>Gendry leans forward and gives her a chaste kiss. She tries to draw him in, but he knows he needs to leave her chamber soon. She kisses him again, and pushes her leg across his stomach down lower, but he catches her thigh with one of his hands. </p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he says. </p><p>She wraps an arm protectively around his shoulder and moves to lay over top of him, trapping him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya, I could use one finger to push you off and leave if I really wanted to,\u201d he says, but makes no move to leave. </p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you?\u201d She asks as she sits up and leans her body from left to right to straddle him. She raises her eyebrow at him, waiting for his response. </p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to. I need to, though,\u201d he says, with a huff. But as Arya moves and pants over top of him, he finds it\u2019s hard to remember why he needs to be anywhere but with her. </p><p>-</p><p>Gendry wakes up later, as light glares through Arya\u2019s window. \u201cShit!\u201d He gasps, and tries to gather his small clothes. Arya sits up and looks at him, a small blush coating her cheeks. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe fell asleep,\u201d he says, trying to keep his voice down, knowing sounds carry and people whisper. \u201cI need to leave before anyone sees me in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Arya says, and hands him his discarded breeches by the edge of her bed. Gendry pulls them on, and tries to tie all of his clothes back together neatly. He finishes dressing and laces his boots up. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look much later than first light, if you leave know you can probably make it out of this wing so you don\u2019t look suspicious.\u201d He quickly nods and walks over to Arya. He plants a small kiss on her forehead and she shoves him lightly. \u201cGo,\u201d she prods and he smiles at her. </p><p>He makes it out into the hallway with only a small creak from the door. He gently shuts it after looking to make sure no one is roaming the corridor. He creeps towards one of the castles many exits, but before he has the chance to hide, the King and the Princess round the corner.</p><p>\u201cGendry?\u201d Jon asks, with a perplexed look on his face. </p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Gendry responds, falling into a kneel. Jon motions for him to stand up and Sansa wears the same look on her face. </p><p>\u201cWhat brought you to the Princess\u2019s chambers this early in the morning?\u201d Jon asks, but Gendry knows Jon already has the answer. </p><p>\u201cThe Princess\u2019s sword needed mending, Your Grace. She asked me to take a look at it,\u201d Gendry lies. </p><p>\u201cAt first light? Surely you had more pressing matters to attend,\u201d The King snaps and he stomps towards Arya\u2019s door. He pulls it open and Arya clutches the linens to her naked chest. </p><p>\u201cJon! Do you knock?\u201d Arya shouts, as Gendry accepts that he\u2019s going to die today. Sansa grimaces and Jon steps towards Gendry. </p><p>Jon grabs Gendry\u2019s arm and starts to walk him away from Arya\u2019s chamber. \u201cSword mending,\u201d he grumbles to himself. Sansa shuts Arya\u2019s door and rushes behind Jon and Gendry. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says, but he doesn\u2019t respond. Gendry keeps pace with Jon and can only hope that Ghost\u2019s whereabouts are unbeknownst to Jon. \u201cJon!\u201d Sansa snaps, and Jon stops to turn around to look at Sansa. </p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d Jon responds. </p><p>\u201cJon, you\u2019re making a scene. You need to calm down,\u201d she hisses, lowering her voice. Arya emerges from her chamber, dressed in breeches and a half-tied jerkin. Her hair remains tangled, and she rushes towards the group. </p><p>\u201cJon, please,\u201d Arya begs, \u201cCan we talk about this? Not here.\u201d</p><p>Jon finally lets his iron-like grip on Gendry go, and nods. \u201cFine.\u201d </p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t give anyone time to respond as he starts walking again. Sansa and Arya follow him, and Gendry trails behind the three, praying to every God he knows. </p><p>They end up in Jon\u2019s solar, and Gendry sits directly across from him, extremely focused on his hands. \u201cDo you want to explain to me why you were in my little sister\u2019s chamber this morning?\u201d Jon asks, looking as angry as any King Gendry had heard about. </p><p>\u201cI needed to mend her sword, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s glower tells Gendry he didn\u2019t give him the correct response. \u201cI fell asleep, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were being improper,\u201d Arya grumbles, giving her brother an eye roll. </p><p>\u201cI know <i>that</i>,\u201d Jon hisses. \u201cI wanted Gendry to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Arya snaps. \u201cAre you going to castrate him?\u201d She agitates, and Gendry silently curses her for giving Jon the idea. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered it!\u201d Gendry moves his hand to protect his manhood. He would sooner set himself on fire than be castrated. </p><p>\u201cJon, be reasonable, please,\u201d Sansa says, and Gendry is thankful for her for being the only calm Stark in this situation. </p><p>\u201cBe reasonable? One of my trusted friends has been&hellip; has been&hellip;\u201d he shakes his hands in Gendry and Arya\u2019s direction. </p><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, Arya and Gendry were friends for much longer than you and Gendry. Unless you were planning on selling Arya in a marriage alliance, it does not really matter what our sister does in private.\u201d</p><p>Jon ran his hands through his curls. \u201cIf you had asked me, I would\u2019ve allowed you to marry,\u201d Jon announces, unexpectedly. Gendry perks up at the King\u2019s words. \u201cNow that you have&hellip;\u201d Jon doesn\u2019t finish his statement. \u201cYou should marry. I won\u2019t force you, Arya, but if you respect me or Gendry, you will not refuse his hand and bear his bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only a bastard, Your Grace. I can\u2019t give the child a bastard\u2019s name.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are the late King Robert\u2019s bastard. I only need to sign a paper, and you could have a last name to give your child.\u201d</p><p>Gendry turns to look at Arya, not wanting to respond without her approval. \u201cWhat are you waiting for, stupid? Are you going to give me your name or not?\u201d She says, with a small smile on her face. Arya always expressed her disgust of marrying as a child, but they rarely spoke of her having to marry as adults. Gendry nods and turns back to Jon. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019ll forgive you for this easily, Gendry,\u201d Jon huffs, and reaches for a blank piece of parchment. </p><p>\u201cKing Robert had always wanted a Stark-Baratheon marriage,\u201d Sansa muses, and gives Arya a small smile. </p><p>(this is highly unedited, and it\u2019s also the first gendrya thing ive ever published EVER please be nice i\u2019m sensitive lol)</p>",

Sansa shuts Arya\u2019s door and rushes behind Jon and Gendry. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says, but he doesn\u2019t respond. Gendry keeps pace with Jon and can only hope that Ghost\u2019s whereabouts are unbeknownst to Jon. \u201cJon!\u201d Sansa snaps, and Jon stops to turn around to look at Sansa. </p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d Jon responds. </p><p>\u201cJon, you\u2019re making a scene. You need to calm down,\u201d she hisses, lowering her voice. Arya emerges from her chamber, dressed in breeches and a half-tied jerkin. Her hair remains tangled, and she rushes towards the group. </p><p>\u201cJon, please,\u201d Arya begs, \u201cCan we talk about this? Not here.\u201d</p><p>Jon finally lets his iron-like grip on Gendry go, and nods. \u201cFine.\u201d </p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t give anyone time to respond as he starts walking again. Sansa and Arya follow him, and Gendry trails behind the three, praying to every God he knows. </p><p>They end up in Jon\u2019s solar, and Gendry sits directly across from him, extremely focused on his hands. \u201cDo you want to explain to me why you were in my little sister\u2019s chamber this morning?\u201d Jon asks, looking as angry as any King Gendry had heard about. </p><p>\u201cI needed to mend her sword, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s glower tells Gendry he didn\u2019t give him the correct response. \u201cI fell asleep, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were being improper,\u201d Arya grumbles, giving her brother an eye roll. </p><p>\u201cI know <i>that</i>,\u201d Jon hisses. \u201cI wanted Gendry to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Arya snaps. \u201cAre you going to castrate him?\u201d She agitates, and Gendry silently curses her for giving Jon the idea. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered it!\u201d Gendry moves his hand to protect his manhood. He would sooner set himself on fire than be castrated. </p><p>\u201cJon, be reasonable, please,\u201d Sansa says, and Gendry is thankful for her for being the only calm Stark in this situation. </p><p>\u201cBe reasonable? One of my trusted friends has been\u2026 has been\u2026\u201d he shakes his hands in Gendry and Arya\u2019s direction. </p><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, Arya and Gendry were friends for much longer than you and Gendry. Unless you were planning on selling Arya in a marriage alliance, it does not really matter what our sister does in private.\u201d</p><p>Jon ran his hands through his curls. \u201cIf you had asked me, I would\u2019ve allowed you to marry,\u201d Jon announces, unexpectedly. Gendry perks up at the King\u2019s words. \u201cNow that you have\u2026\u201d Jon doesn\u2019t finish his statement. \u201cYou should marry. I won\u2019t force you, Arya, but if you respect me or Gendry, you will not refuse his hand and bear his bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only a bastard, Your Grace. I can\u2019t give the child a bastard\u2019s name.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are the late King Robert\u2019s bastard. I only need to sign a paper, and you could have a last name to give your child.\u201d</p><p>Gendry turns to look at Arya, not wanting to respond without her approval. \u201cWhat are you waiting for, stupid? Are you going to give me your name or not?\u201d She says, with a small smile on her face. Arya always expressed her disgust of marrying as a child, but they rarely spoke of her having to marry as adults. Gendry nods and turns back to Jon. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019ll forgive you for this easily, Gendry,\u201d Jon huffs, and reaches for a blank piece of parchment. </p><p>\u201cKing Robert had always wanted a Stark-Baratheon marriage,\u201d Sansa muses, and gives Arya a small smile. </p><p>(this is highly unedited, and it\u2019s also the first gendrya thing ive ever published EVER please be nice i\u2019m sensitive lol)</p></p>",

He didn\u2019t want to leave her while she slept, but first light would come soon, and Gendry could not be caught in the Princess\u2019s bed. Her leg lays across his stomach, and every time she moves, the smooth inside of her thigh slides across his hip. Her body bare except for the thin linen that drapes across their hips. Her head is on his arm, but most of her body rests on his side, and presses her breasts against his ribs. She shifts again, and her leg ventures lower. </p><p>Her body had small scars all over, but the insides of her thighs were soft. The outsides were just as scarred as the rest of her body. He mindlessly rubbed his hand on her back, and felt some of her scars from the House of Black and White. Her arms had healed cuts from various things, but he loved the mark on her face the most. She had fallen out of a tree as a child, and split her lip open, leaving a faint scar that led up to her nostril. He tries not to despise the scars that mark her stomach, but it\u2019s hard. She says they\u2019re ugly, and he knows she\u2019s self-conscious of them every time she removes her clothes for him, so he\u2019s sure to hide the fury he feels when he sees them. They could have killed her. They almost did. Unlike the scars that littered her body to teach her lessons for losing her balance while climbing a tree or not paying close enough attention to the end of a blade while fighting. But the scars on her belly only showed that she had failed to obey an order to kill someone underserving of death. She murmurs something to Gendry and he doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s waking or sleep talking. She slides her leg across his stomach, resting it just below his belly button. Her hair, which she still keeps short (albeit neatly cut to reach her shoulders) had tangled from the early events of this morning and fell across her face. A chunk stuck to the corner of her mouth and moves a little which each breath she withdraws. Gendry smiles softly and brushes it away from her face. She hums in response, finally stirring from her sleep. She opens her eyes and huffs a little. </p><p>\u201cMorning, already?\u201d She mumbles, and he smiles again at her sleepy state. </p><p>\u201cYou can sleep for a while longer, I need to get back to the forge,\u201d he whispers, trying not to rouse her too much. </p><p>\u201cHave you slept?\u201d She asks, shutting her eyes again and snuggling her face against Gendry\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cNo, I was going to sleep for a little while at the forge before everyone wakes up,\u201d he says, and he knows she\u2019s probably rolling her eyes at him under his chin. The war against the Night King had ended, but Cersei Lannister still wanted Jon and Daenerys\u2019s heads on spikes for trying to rebel against her claim to the throne. And they needed weapons to win. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just sleep here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have the King in the North and his wolf catch me? I think not, m\u2019lady.\u201d She groans in response to the nickname. \u201cOh, right, my apologies, <i>Your Grace</i>,\u201d he teases and she shoves his chest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the princess, stupid. Sansa is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I checked, having a brother for a King makes you a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many princesses do you know of that invite men into their beds,\u201d she snaps, and he lets out a small chuckle. </p><p>\u201c<i>Men</i>? I hope you don\u2019t mean more than me,\u201d he teases and she smiles against his throat. She hums. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops, you weren\u2019t supposed to know about my many lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now that you\u2019ve told me they exist, I have to know who I\u2019m fighting for your affections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she leans up from her spot and rests her head on her hand. \u201cThere\u2019s Podrick\u2026 Samwell\u2026 my brother\u2019s wife Meera\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBronn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim, too,\u201d she jests. \u201cAnd Jaime Lannister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must say, Your Grace, you are quite the little scoundrel of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone had to be,\u201d she gives him a smile, one that was reserved for him in private. When she trained in Braavos she learned to hide her emotions, but the only one that she couldn\u2019t control around Gendry was love. </p><p>Gendry leans forward and gives her a chaste kiss. She tries to draw him in, but he knows he needs to leave her chamber soon. She kisses him again, and pushes her leg across his stomach down lower, but he catches her thigh with one of his hands. </p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he says. </p><p>She wraps an arm protectively around his shoulder and moves to lay over top of him, trapping him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya, I could use one finger to push you off and leave if I really wanted to,\u201d he says, but makes no move to leave. </p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you?\u201d She asks as she sits up and leans her body from left to right to straddle him. She raises her eyebrow at him, waiting for his response. </p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to. I need to, though,\u201d he says, with a huff. But as Arya moves and pants over top of him, he finds it\u2019s hard to remember why he needs to be anywhere but with her. </p><p>-</p><p>Gendry wakes up later, as light glares through Arya\u2019s window. \u201cShit!\u201d He gasps, and tries to gather his small clothes. Arya sits up and looks at him, a small blush coating her cheeks. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe fell asleep,\u201d he says, trying to keep his voice down, knowing sounds carry and people whisper. \u201cI need to leave before anyone sees me in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Arya says, and hands him his discarded breeches by the edge of her bed. Gendry pulls them on, and tries to tie all of his clothes back together neatly. He finishes dressing and laces his boots up. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look much later than first light, if you leave know you can probably make it out of this wing so you don\u2019t look suspicious.\u201d He quickly nods and walks over to Arya. He plants a small kiss on her forehead and she shoves him lightly. \u201cGo,\u201d she prods and he smiles at her. </p><p>He makes it out into the hallway with only a small creak from the door. He gently shuts it after looking to make sure no one is roaming the corridor. He creeps towards one of the castles many exits, but before he has the chance to hide, the King and the Princess round the corner.</p><p>\u201cGendry?\u201d Jon asks, with a perplexed look on his face. </p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Gendry responds, falling into a kneel. Jon motions for him to stand up and Sansa wears the same look on her face. </p><p>\u201cWhat brought you to the Princess\u2019s chambers this early in the morning?\u201d Jon asks, but Gendry knows Jon already has the answer. </p><p>\u201cThe Princess\u2019s sword needed mending, Your Grace. She asked me to take a look at it,\u201d Gendry lies. </p><p>\u201cAt first light? Surely you had more pressing matters to attend,\u201d The King snaps and he stomps towards Arya\u2019s door. He pulls it open and Arya clutches the linens to her naked chest. </p><p>\u201cJon! Do you knock?\u201d Arya shouts, as Gendry accepts that he\u2019s going to die today. Sansa grimaces and Jon steps towards Gendry. </p><p>Jon grabs Gendry\u2019s arm and starts to walk him away from Arya\u2019s chamber. \u201cSword mending,\u201d he grumbles to himself.

Gendry keeps pace with Jon and can only hope that Ghost\u2019s whereabouts are unbeknownst to Jon. \u201cJon!\u201d Sansa snaps, and Jon stops to turn around to look at Sansa. </p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d Jon responds. </p><p>\u201cJon, you\u2019re making a scene.

She opens her eyes and huffs a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning, already?&rdquo; She mumbles, and he smiles again at her sleepy state. </p><p>&ldquo;You can sleep for a while longer, I need to get back to the forge,&rdquo; he whispers, trying not to rouse her too much. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you slept?&rdquo; She asks, shutting her eyes again and snuggling her face against Gendry&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I was going to sleep for a little while at the forge before everyone wakes up,&rdquo; he says, and he knows she&rsquo;s probably rolling her eyes at him under his chin. The war against the Night King had ended, but Cersei Lannister still wanted Jon and Daenerys&rsquo;s heads on spikes for trying to rebel against her claim to the throne. And they needed weapons to win. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just sleep here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And have the King in the North and his wolf catch me? I think not, m&rsquo;lady.&rdquo; She groans in response to the nickname. &ldquo;Oh, right, my apologies, <i>Your Grace</i>,&rdquo; he teases and she shoves his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the princess, stupid. Sansa is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Last I checked, having a brother for a King makes you a princess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How many princesses do you know of that invite men into their beds,&rdquo; she snaps, and he lets out a small chuckle. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Men</i>? I hope you don&rsquo;t mean more than me,&rdquo; he teases and she smiles against his throat. She hums. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oops, you weren&rsquo;t supposed to know about my many lovers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well now that you&rsquo;ve told me they exist, I have to know who I&rsquo;m fighting for your affections.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; she leans up from her spot and rests her head on her hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Podrick&hellip; Samwell&hellip; my brother&rsquo;s wife Meera&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bronn?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Him, too,&rdquo; she jests. &ldquo;And Jaime Lannister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must say, Your Grace, you are quite the little scoundrel of Winterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Someone had to be,&rdquo; she gives him a smile, one that was reserved for him in private. When she trained in Braavos she learned to hide her emotions, but the only one that she couldn&rsquo;t control around Gendry was love. </p><p>Gendry leans forward and gives her a chaste kiss. She tries to draw him in, but he knows he needs to leave her chamber soon. She kisses him again, and pushes her leg across his stomach down lower, but he catches her thigh with one of his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; he says. </p><p>She wraps an arm protectively around his shoulder and moves to lay over top of him, trapping him. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arya, I could use one finger to push you off and leave if I really wanted to,&rdquo; he says, but makes no move to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Then why haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She asks as she sits up and leans her body from left to right to straddle him. She raises her eyebrow at him, waiting for his response. </p><p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to. I need to, though,&rdquo; he says, with a huff. But as Arya moves and pants over top of him, he finds it&rsquo;s hard to remember why he needs to be anywhere but with her. </p><p>-</p><p>Gendry wakes up later, as light glares through Arya&rsquo;s window. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; He gasps, and tries to gather his small clothes. Arya sits up and looks at him, a small blush coating her cheeks. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We fell asleep,&rdquo; he says, trying to keep his voice down, knowing sounds carry and people whisper. &ldquo;I need to leave before anyone sees me in here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Arya says, and hands him his discarded breeches by the edge of her bed. Gendry pulls them on, and tries to tie all of his clothes back together neatly. He finishes dressing and laces his boots up. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look much later than first light, if you leave know you can probably make it out of this wing so you don&rsquo;t look suspicious.&rdquo; He quickly nods and walks over to Arya. He plants a small kiss on her forehead and she shoves him lightly. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she prods and he smiles at her. </p><p>He makes it out into the hallway with only a small creak from the door. He gently shuts it after looking to make sure no one is roaming the corridor. He creeps towards one of the castles many exits, but before he has the chance to hide, the King and the Princess round the corner.</p><p>&ldquo;Gendry?&rdquo; Jon asks, with a perplexed look on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; Gendry responds, falling into a kneel. Jon motions for him to stand up and Sansa wears the same look on her face. </p><p>&ldquo;What brought you to the Princess&rsquo;s chambers this early in the morning?&rdquo; Jon asks, but Gendry knows Jon already has the answer. </p><p>&ldquo;The Princess&rsquo;s sword needed mending, Your Grace. She asked me to take a look at it,&rdquo; Gendry lies. </p><p>&ldquo;At first light? Surely you had more pressing matters to attend,&rdquo; The King snaps and he stomps towards Arya&rsquo;s door. He pulls it open and Arya clutches the linens to her naked chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon! Do you knock?&rdquo; Arya shouts, as Gendry accepts that he&rsquo;s going to die today. Sansa grimaces and Jon steps towards Gendry. </p><p>Jon grabs Gendry&rsquo;s arm and starts to walk him away from Arya&rsquo;s chamber. &ldquo;Sword mending,&rdquo; he grumbles to himself. Sansa shuts Arya&rsquo;s door and rushes behind Jon and Gendry. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she says, but he doesn&rsquo;t respond. Gendry keeps pace with Jon and can only hope that Ghost&rsquo;s whereabouts are unbeknownst to Jon. &ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; Sansa snaps, and Jon stops to turn around to look at Sansa. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; Jon responds. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon, you&rsquo;re making a scene. You need to calm down,&rdquo; she hisses, lowering her voice. Arya emerges from her chamber, dressed in breeches and a half-tied jerkin. Her hair remains tangled, and she rushes towards the group. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon, please,&rdquo; Arya begs, &ldquo;Can we talk about this? Not here.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon finally lets his iron-like grip on Gendry go, and nods. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; </p><p>Jon doesn&rsquo;t give anyone time to respond as he starts walking again. Sansa and Arya follow him, and Gendry trails behind the three, praying to every God he knows. </p><p>They end up in Jon&rsquo;s solar, and Gendry sits directly across from him, extremely focused on his hands. &ldquo;Do you want to explain to me why you were in my little sister&rsquo;s chamber this morning?&rdquo; Jon asks, looking as angry as any King Gendry had heard about. </p><p>&ldquo;I needed to mend her sword, Your Grace.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s glower tells Gendry he didn&rsquo;t give him the correct response. &ldquo;I fell asleep, Your Grace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were being improper,&rdquo; Arya grumbles, giving her brother an eye roll. </p><p>&ldquo;I know <i>that</i>,&rdquo; Jon hisses. &ldquo;I wanted Gendry to tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Arya snaps. &ldquo;Are you going to castrate him?&rdquo; She agitates, and Gendry silently curses her for giving Jon the idea. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve considered it!&rdquo; Gendry moves his hand to protect his manhood. He would sooner set himself on fire than be castrated. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon, be reasonable, please,&rdquo; Sansa says, and Gendry is thankful for her for being the only calm Stark in this situation. </p><p>&ldquo;Be reasonable? One of my trusted friends has been&hellip; has been&hellip;&rdquo; he shakes his hands in Gendry and Arya&rsquo;s direction. </p><p>&ldquo;If I remember correctly, Arya and Gendry were friends for much longer than you and Gendry. Unless you were planning on selling Arya in a marriage alliance, it does not really matter what our sister does in private.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon ran his hands through his curls. &ldquo;If you had asked me, I would&rsquo;ve allowed you to marry,&rdquo; Jon announces, unexpectedly. Gendry perks up at the King&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Now that you have&hellip;&rdquo; Jon doesn&rsquo;t finish his statement. &ldquo;You should marry. I won&rsquo;t force you, Arya, but if you respect me or Gendry, you will not refuse his hand and bear his bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a bastard, Your Grace. I can&rsquo;t give the child a bastard&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are the late King Robert&rsquo;s bastard. I only need to sign a paper, and you could have a last name to give your child.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry turns to look at Arya, not wanting to respond without her approval. &ldquo;What are you waiting for, stupid? Are you going to give me your name or not?&rdquo; She says, with a small smile on her face. Arya always expressed her disgust of marrying as a child, but they rarely spoke of her having to marry as adults. Gendry nods and turns back to Jon. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ll forgive you for this easily, Gendry,&rdquo; Jon huffs, and reaches for a blank piece of parchment. </p><p>&ldquo;King Robert had always wanted a Stark-Baratheon marriage,&rdquo; Sansa muses, and gives Arya a small smile. </p><p>(this is highly unedited, and it&rsquo;s also the first gendrya thing ive ever published EVER please be nice i&rsquo;m sensitive lol)</p></p>",

        "body": "<p>So I just wanted to jot down some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p><p>In Season 1/Book1, her relationship with Arya is that of rival siblings who don\u2019t get along. A lot of people notice that Sansa is closer to their mother and Arya feels left out, and often feels as though her mother is trying to force her into a role of a lady and to be more like Sansa. She obviously has a closer relationship to her father, in comparison, who encouraged her to be herself. Where Arya feels like she\u2019s left out from a relationship with her mother, Sansa feels like she\u2019s left out from a relationship with her father. Both children love their parents and are loved in turn, but their parents have made it sort of obvious that they understand and get along with one child more than the other. Sansa idealizes her mother, and tries to imitate her, and expects Arya to do the same since they are both the same gender. However, Arya idealizes her father, and resists conforming to societal expectations.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that they are children. Sansa is 11-12 depending on books or seasons, when we meet her, and Arya is 9-10. We are introduced to Sansa through Arya\u2019s perspective, and since she\u2019s such a lovable character, we automatically see Sansa as her antithesis, since they are such opposites. But BOTH are bratty kids. Sansa is snobby, and Arya is rebellious. Neither wants to understand the other.\u00a0</p><p>Her relationship with her other siblings is easier: She is closer to Robb, or as close as she can be to her brothers, and she is an older sibling to Bran and Rickon, without the tension that she has with Arya. She understands that they have different roles in society, and is able to interact with them normally.\u00a0</p><p>Her relationship with Jon is different. Because Jon is her father\u2019s bastard son, and is disliked by Catelyn, Sansa imitates this behavior to some degree. She knows her mother doesn\u2019t like Jon, and at worst, is indifferent with some teasing. Perhaps, if her relationship with her father was stronger/closer like the one he has with Arya, this would have been different. But as it is, Sansa\u2019s education and parenting was basically left up to Catelyn, and Ned is the father who will tell her she looks pretty and that he\u2019ll give her a good husband one day. This is not to say that she didn\u2019t have a relationship with Jon. In the books, we do know that when Jon thinks of Sansa, he remembers that she taught him how to talk to girls and how to dance. So we can think that either they had initially had a good relationship before Sansa understood what a bastard was, and why her mother disliked Jon, or we can think that even while she knew that Jon was a bastard, she sometimes still interacted with him without being bratty. Which isn\u2019t unbelievable.\u00a0</p><p>A lot of people use the situation at the crossings as evidence that Sansa is a bad sibling. On that score, I have only to quote what Ned said to Arya, which was Sansa was put in the position of having to call the prince a liar in front of the king and queen. She was already betrothed to Joffrey, and was trying to set up a rapport with him in some fashion. A lot of criticism is that Sansa fell in love with Joffrey because she wanted to be queen. Well Sansa was a preteen, and I liken her initial behavior with Joffrey as the same as Anna from Frozen when she met Hans for the first time. Her fantasy was finally coming true and her life was finally starting, at least in her mind. Anyways, Sansa is the one who loses the most, as Lady dies &ndash; which incidentally pushes her further from her father and sister since she blames them for her death. Which isn\u2019t entirely unfounded; her father did kill Lady and Arya\u2019s wolf was the one that bit Joffrey. It doesn\u2019t help that Arya blames Sansa for Mycah\u2019s murder (or at least holds Sansa to some level of responsibility &ndash; like the queen and Joffrey and the hound). I want to be super clear when i say that Sansa had nothing to do with that &ndash; Mycah was already run down by the time they were having the meeting with the king.\u00a0</p><p>So at this point we have Sansa\u2019s relationship with her father and sister super distant. Ned can\u2019t bridge the gap because he doesn\u2019t understand how to be a parent to Sansa. He understand\u2019s Arya because they are similar, but Sansa is different. She\u2019s a lady who was raised and influenced by his southern wife and a septa. This doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t Northern. She is very proud of the fact that she understands houses of the north and reading and writing better than her brothers (though Arya is better at math than her). But Sansa prepared for a life in the south. Which is why she puts a lot of effort into repairing her relationship with her fiance. At this point, and actually throughout the entire first book, Ned has said nothing against Joffrey. Sansa is doing what she is meant to be doing.\u00a0</p><p>Now in the books &ndash; not the shows &ndash; Sansa goes to the queen to tell her Ned plans to return them home. She has no idea that Ned went to the queen to tell her he knew about her infidelity. Why would she, Ned didn\u2019t confide in anyone. He hasn\u2019t told her anything besides the fact that she was leaving kingslanding and that the betrothal she has be working on for the past year was over. Going behind her fathers back to tell the queen, while it sounds bad, is equivalent to say asking your friend\u2019s parent if you could stay for a sleepover when your parents already said you can\u2019t. And if you say, well she still shouldn\u2019t have done that, well I want to say again that Ned killed Lady. Those wolves have deep relationships with the Starks. Ned, who claimed to be very close to Robert, did nothing besides a half-hearted attempt at convincing the king to spare her. he didn\u2019t suggest sending her north, he didn\u2019t pack up and leave right away, he didn\u2019t do anything but kill his daughter\u2019s direwolf.\u00a0</p><p>As viewers/readers, we know the Lannisters are bad news. But to a character like Sansa, they aren\u2019t even the ruling family, the Baratheons are. Any fault can be put on Robert\u2019s feet since he is the king. She has no idea that Robert has little say in the going ons of the realm since he\u2019s in so much debt to the Lannisters, and that he\u2019s outnumbered by Lannister men. But the death of Lady is put more a the feet of Robert than Cersei, especially since at this point, Sansa still lives in the fantasy that Queens are supposed to be kind and gracious (and why wouldn\u2019t she think that; her idols are figures like good Queen Alysanne and she hasn\u2019t ever heard of Cersei doing anything bad). It won\u2019t be until Cersei starts showing her true colors that she puts the blame of lady\u2019s death on Cersei.\u00a0</p><p>In Book2-3/Season 2-3, we get a bit more of a glimpse on Sansa\u2019s relationship with Robb. Robb is Sansa\u2019s knight in shining armor. (while we can\u2019t exactly say he started a war for her &ndash; he started a war for their father &ndash; we knows that he continued south because he wanted her back (and he wanted Joffrey off the throne, but it would have been easier to hold the north than lead a campaign south) But she knows that he is fighting a war and that she would return to him if he won. I want to say that i completely understand Robb not giving up Jamie for his sister. He is the king and he has to think about the good of his people before anything else. However, Sansa does see on some level what she\u2019s worth when Robb marries the wrong girl (Talisa/Jeyne). He loses most of his army to marry a woman, rather than risk that army to return his sister to him. Now, Robb (books and shows) is a child. He little more than 15 in the books, 17-18 in the shows. if we can be sympathetic to him for being a kid and making mistakes, we can be understanding to a little girl who was even younger.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame Robb; he had bad advisors, in the books he had plans to go back North and reclaim it from the iron born after the wedding, and in the show, he had plans to take Casterly rock and send men to the North after securing the frey army. But Roose bolton suggested he detour on the way and none of his other advisors, besides telling him he\u2019s an idiot who lost the North, ever really did anything. Sansa doens\u2019t blame her brother either &ndash; in the preview of Winds of Winter, she remarks how young a boy is and says that if her brother was alive he would be that young. She maintains that her brother was her hero, even if he failed.\u00a0</p><p>While George barely mentioned Sansa in the last two books, because of her central role in the show, I have high hopes for Sansa in the coming books.\u00a0</p><p>And those are just some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p>",

Ned can\u2019t bridge the gap because he doesn\u2019t understand how to be a parent to Sansa. He understand\u2019s Arya because they are similar, but Sansa is different. She\u2019s a lady who was raised and influenced by his southern wife and a septa. This doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t Northern. She is very proud of the fact that she understands houses of the north and reading and writing better than her brothers (though Arya is better at math than her). But Sansa prepared for a life in the south. Which is why she puts a lot of effort into repairing her relationship with her fiance. At this point, and actually throughout the entire first book, Ned has said nothing against Joffrey. Sansa is doing what she is meant to be doing.\u00a0</p><p>Now in the books \u2013 not the shows \u2013 Sansa goes to the queen to tell her Ned plans to return them home. She has no idea that Ned went to the queen to tell her he knew about her infidelity. Why would she, Ned didn\u2019t confide in anyone. He hasn\u2019t told her anything besides the fact that she was leaving kingslanding and that the betrothal she has be working on for the past year was over. Going behind her fathers back to tell the queen, while it sounds bad, is equivalent to say asking your friend\u2019s parent if you could stay for a sleepover when your parents already said you can\u2019t. And if you say, well she still shouldn\u2019t have done that, well I want to say again that Ned killed Lady. Those wolves have deep relationships with the Starks. Ned, who claimed to be very close to Robert, did nothing besides a half-hearted attempt at convincing the king to spare her. he didn\u2019t suggest sending her north, he didn\u2019t pack up and leave right away, he didn\u2019t do anything but kill his daughter\u2019s direwolf.\u00a0</p><p>As viewers/readers, we know the Lannisters are bad news. But to a character like Sansa, they aren\u2019t even the ruling family, the Baratheons are. Any fault can be put on Robert\u2019s feet since he is the king. She has no idea that Robert has little say in the going ons of the realm since he\u2019s in so much debt to the Lannisters, and that he\u2019s outnumbered by Lannister men. But the death of Lady is put more a the feet of Robert than Cersei, especially since at this point, Sansa still lives in the fantasy that Queens are supposed to be kind and gracious (and why wouldn\u2019t she think that; her idols are figures like good Queen Alysanne and she hasn\u2019t ever heard of Cersei doing anything bad). It won\u2019t be until Cersei starts showing her true colors that she puts the blame of lady\u2019s death on Cersei.\u00a0</p><p>In Book2-3/Season 2-3, we get a bit more of a glimpse on Sansa\u2019s relationship with Robb. Robb is Sansa\u2019s knight in shining armor. (while we can\u2019t exactly say he started a war for her \u2013 he started a war for their father \u2013 we knows that he continued south because he wanted her back (and he wanted Joffrey off the throne, but it would have been easier to hold the north than lead a campaign south) But she knows that he is fighting a war and that she would return to him if he won. I want to say that i completely understand Robb not giving up Jamie for his sister. He is the king and he has to think about the good of his people before anything else. However, Sansa does see on some level what she\u2019s worth when Robb marries the wrong girl (Talisa/Jeyne). He loses most of his army to marry a woman, rather than risk that army to return his sister to him. Now, Robb (books and shows) is a child. He little more than 15 in the books, 17-18 in the shows. if we can be sympathetic to him for being a kid and making mistakes, we can be understanding to a little girl who was even younger.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame Robb; he had bad advisors, in the books he had plans to go back North and reclaim it from the iron born after the wedding, and in the show, he had plans to take Casterly rock and send men to the North after securing the frey army. But Roose bolton suggested he detour on the way and none of his other advisors, besides telling him he\u2019s an idiot who lost the North, ever really did anything. Sansa doens\u2019t blame her brother either \u2013 in the preview of Winds of Winter, she remarks how young a boy is and says that if her brother was alive he would be that young. She maintains that her brother was her hero, even if he failed.\u00a0</p><p>While George barely mentioned Sansa in the last two books, because of her central role in the show, I have high hopes for Sansa in the coming books.\u00a0</p><p>And those are just some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>So I just wanted to jot down some of my thoughts on Sansa&rsquo;s relationships with her siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>In Season 1/Book1, her relationship with Arya is that of rival siblings who don&rsquo;t get along. A lot of people notice that Sansa is closer to their mother and Arya feels left out, and often feels as though her mother is trying to force her into a role of a lady and to be more like Sansa. She obviously has a closer relationship to her father, in comparison, who encouraged her to be herself. Where Arya feels like she&rsquo;s left out from a relationship with her mother, Sansa feels like she&rsquo;s left out from a relationship with her father. Both children love their parents and are loved in turn, but their parents have made it sort of obvious that they understand and get along with one child more than the other. Sansa idealizes her mother, and tries to imitate her, and expects Arya to do the same since they are both the same gender. However, Arya idealizes her father, and resists conforming to societal expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that they are children. Sansa is 11-12 depending on books or seasons, when we meet her, and Arya is 9-10. We are introduced to Sansa through Arya&rsquo;s perspective, and since she&rsquo;s such a lovable character, we automatically see Sansa as her antithesis, since they are such opposites. But BOTH are bratty kids. Sansa is snobby, and Arya is rebellious. Neither wants to understand the other.&nbsp;</p><p>Her relationship with her other siblings is easier: She is closer to Robb, or as close as she can be to her brothers, and she is an older sibling to Bran and Rickon, without the tension that she has with Arya. She understands that they have different roles in society, and is able to interact with them normally.&nbsp;</p><p>Her relationship with Jon is different. Because Jon is her father&rsquo;s bastard son, and is disliked by Catelyn, Sansa imitates this behavior to some degree. She knows her mother doesn&rsquo;t like Jon, and at worst, is indifferent with some teasing. Perhaps, if her relationship with her father was stronger/closer like the one he has with Arya, this would have been different. But as it is, Sansa&rsquo;s education and parenting was basically left up to Catelyn, and Ned is the father who will tell her she looks pretty and that he&rsquo;ll give her a good husband one day. This is not to say that she didn&rsquo;t have a relationship with Jon. In the books, we do know that when Jon thinks of Sansa, he remembers that she taught him how to talk to girls and how to dance. So we can think that either they had initially had a good relationship before Sansa understood what a bastard was, and why her mother disliked Jon, or we can think that even while she knew that Jon was a bastard, she sometimes still interacted with him without being bratty. Which isn&rsquo;t unbelievable.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people use the situation at the crossings as evidence that Sansa is a bad sibling. On that score, I have only to quote what Ned said to Arya, which was Sansa was put in the position of having to call the prince a liar in front of the king and queen. She was already betrothed to Joffrey, and was trying to set up a rapport with him in some fashion. A lot of criticism is that Sansa fell in love with Joffrey because she wanted to be queen. Well Sansa was a preteen, and I liken her initial behavior with Joffrey as the same as Anna from Frozen when she met Hans for the first time. Her fantasy was finally coming true and her life was finally starting, at least in her mind. Anyways, Sansa is the one who loses the most, as Lady dies &ndash; which incidentally pushes her further from her father and sister since she blames them for her death. Which isn&rsquo;t entirely unfounded; her father did kill Lady and Arya&rsquo;s wolf was the one that bit Joffrey. It doesn&rsquo;t help that Arya blames Sansa for Mycah&rsquo;s murder (or at least holds Sansa to some level of responsibility &ndash; like the queen and Joffrey and the hound). I want to be super clear when i say that Sansa had nothing to do with that &ndash; Mycah was already run down by the time they were having the meeting with the king.&nbsp;</p><p>So at this point we have Sansa&rsquo;s relationship with her father and sister super distant.
