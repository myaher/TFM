Come on. Up. Change of plans.\u201d\nYou grumbled and wiggled out of Bucky&rsquo;s arms, picking up his shirt\nand throwing it on since it was big enough to cover you so you could\nanswer the door with a snarl. \u201cWhat Stark?!\u201d You glared at the\nman and he pushed passed you into your room, freezing in place as he\nsaw Bucky now sitting up in your bed, barely covered with the\nblanket. \u201cWell alright then.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cChange of\nplans. You&rsquo;re both coming with us to that base in Russia. We&rsquo;ve got\nsome intelligence that there are plenty of bad guys&rsquo; asses for you\nboth to kick. Meet in the hanger ready to go in 20. We&rsquo;ll fill you\nboth in to the rest of the plan on the way.\u201d \u201cFine Stark. Out.\u201d\nYou held the door open and motioned for him to exit, closing it a bit\nharder than necessary once he was through. You sighed and ran your\nhand across your face as you took a breath, trying to wake yourself\nup. \u201cOk.\u201d You picked up Bucky&rsquo;s pants and tossed them to him as\nhe stood up. \u201cI&rsquo;ll meet you in the hanger.\u201d \u201cAm I getting my\nshirt back?\u201d He smirked and you just shook your head. \u201cNope. Is\nmine now.\u201d You pulled him to you to plant a kiss on his lips, but\nhe pulled you tighter against him and deepened the kiss, squeezing\nyour bare ass with his flesh hand causing you to squeak. He chuckled\nas he released you. \u201cSee you in 20.\u201d \n</p><p>You\nwere still strapping throwing knives into place as you made your way\nup the ramp into the quinjet. \u201cDoll.\u201d You looked up to see Bucky\nalready standing there, ready to go with a cup of coffee held out to\nyou. You smiled and kissed his cheek as you took the cup. \u201cYou\nmight have just saved Tony&rsquo;s life.\u201d He just chuckled and followed\nyou over to your seat next to Steve. \u201cMornin Y/N. You seem&hellip;\nDifferent.\u201d He looks between you and Bucky for a moment. \u201cThey\nfinally hooked up.\u201d Tony stated as he walked over to you. \u201cOh.\nGood.\u201d Steve nodded and you almost choked on your coffee. \u201cDid\neveryone&hellip;\u201d \u201cYeah pretty much.\u201d Clint said, passing what\nlooked like a 20 to Natasha. You rolled your eyes and sighed, then\nleaned into Bucky&rsquo;s side with a shrug. \u201cJust took some of Thor&rsquo;s\nwhiskey to get me to fess up.\u201d \u201cHa! Told you it&rsquo;d be her.\u201d\nWanda pointed at Steve. \u201cCan we focus?\u201d Bucky interrupted.\n\u201cWhat&rsquo;s the plan?\u201d \u201cYou and Cap are going to be clearing levels\nin front of Wanda and Y/N as they make their way towards the\nbasement&hellip;\u201d \u201cWhere the cells are.\u201d You spoke up as Tony\nprovided a holographic map of the building lay out according to your\nmemory. \u201cCorrect.

We got\nthis.\u201d<br/></p><p>You\nspent the rest of the ride sipping your coffee and trying to scour\nyour memory to pinpoint where everything was exactly so there were no\nunnecessary surprises. \u201cDoll?\u201d \u201cHmm?\u201d You didn&rsquo;t look up from\nthe map. \u201cY/N?\u201d Bucky said softer this time, causing you to meet\nhis eyes. He tilted his head slightly and you nodded, and leaned\nagainst him for a second. \u201cWe got this.\u201d You gave him a\nreassuring smile and returned your attention to the map.<br/></p><p>An\nhour later, Clint spoke up from his spot in the pilot&rsquo;s seat.\n\u201cAlright boys and girls. We&rsquo;re here.\u201d You walked up and pointed\nto a spot where you knew you could land. \u201cBring her down over\nthere. The door&rsquo;s right there. We should be able to get in unnoticed\nif we come from this side.\u201d He nodded and silently landed the\nquinjet where you pointed. One final check of weapons, and you all\nfiled out. Tony took the lead, letting his tech scan for heat\nsignatures, motioning to Nat where they were so she could take them\nout quickly and quietly. The door was locked, but it was easy enough\nfor Wanda to use her magic to move the tumblers, and Steve and Bucky\npoured in as soon as the lock clicked, immediately taking out two\nguards just inside. Your team moved silent and deadly through the\nhalls until you made it to the split up point. Tony and Natasha\nducked off to find the computers, and Bucky and Steve started to\ndescend the stairs with you and Wanda following closely behind. The\nboys took out one Hydra operative after another as you all made your\nway down. Finally you came to the door you knew well enough. \u201cOk.\nJust through here.\u201d Muffled screams of agony filled the air then,\nand caused you to flinch, but you quickly shook it off as Wanda\nunlocked this door as easily as she had the first.</p><p>Steve\nand Bucky filed in and opened fire on the soldiers already raising\ntheir guns at you as you flung a knife into the temple of the man\nwith the scalpel standing over the doctor strapped to the chair.\n\u201cFuck you asshole. I told you I&rsquo;d kill you.\u201d You spat out in\nRussian as you made your way over to the doctor. \u201cHey. You&rsquo;re the\none that helped me out aren&rsquo;t you?\u201d You spoke in Russian to the man\nwho nodded, but responded in English. \u201cYes. I don&rsquo;t know if you\nremember me, but we used to work together. This is the second time\nyou&rsquo;ve saved my life.\u201d \u201cYou&rsquo;re not safe yet.\u201d Bucky barked.\n\u201cWe&rsquo;ll get you out of here.\u201d You began to undo his restraints,\nthen let your magic wash over him, healing his more important wounds.\n\u201cIs there anyone else down here?\u201d Steve said as he kept his eye\non the doorway. \u201cNo. They killed everyone else that let you escape.\nThey were hoping I could tell them where you went.\u201d You sighed.\n\u201cOk. What did you give them?\u201d \u201cI gave up one of your safe\nhouses, but hopefully it&rsquo;s a dead one.\u201d \u201cMost of them are.\u201d You\nhelped the man stand up and started to lead him out the door.</p><p>Just\nas you passed the threshold a bullet exploded the doctor&rsquo;s head, and\nhalf a second later, there was a barrel digging into your temple and\none more soldier with his gun to Wanda&rsquo;s head. \u201cDrop em boys. I\ndon&rsquo;t want to kill my favorite little toy just yet, but I will.\u201d\nThe man had the gun pressed against your temple and used his other\nhand to slide up your body to grope your breast, then down the front\nof your suit. \u201cDon&rsquo;t.\u201d Bucky took a half step forward, and the\nman dug the gun into your head further. \u201cAsset?\u201d His voice piqued\nin curiosity. \u201cWell&hellip; Hmm&hellip; two for one. Lucky me.\u201d He grinned\nand began speaking in Russian. \u201cLonging.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Steve took a\nstep this time. \u201cBack off star spangled idiot. I&rsquo;ll kill them\nboth.\u201d \u201cRusted.\u201d Bucky growled. \u201cPlease&hellip;\u201d You whispered\nas you pressed your body against his, grinding your ass into his\ncrotch slightly. \u201cPlease let them go. You can keep me.\u201d He\ngrabbed your hair and yanked your head to the side, then growled in\nyour ear. \u201cOh I&rsquo;m keeping you both baby.\u201d Then licked your neck.\n\u201cHmm&hellip; Seems like someone else has had you recently.\u201d \u201cYeah\nhim!\u201d You slammed your head into his and at the same time, flung a\nknife into the throat of the man holding a gun to Wanda. You spun\naround and kicked the man&rsquo;s legs out from under him, causing him to\nsqueeze the trigger during his fall, and you quickly shoved a knife\ninto his throat not noticing the bullet had gone into your torso. You\nquickly turned around to make sure everyone else was alright.\n\u201cBucky?! You good?\u201d \u201cDoll&hellip; Patch yourself up before you worry\nabout me.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d You looked down as the adrenaline ceased\nenough that you felt the pain. \u201cOw!\u201d You threw your hand over the\nwound as white light poured from it. \u201cShit. I can&rsquo;t until we get\nthe bullet out. I&rsquo;ll be fine though. Nothing major was hit.\u201d<br/></p><p>You\nall made it back to the quinjet quickly as you took out the rest of\nthe soldiers you came across, and once inside, Nat and Wanda rushed\nto your side as you pulled your top off, causing Bucky, Steve and\nTony to turn their backs to you as Clint brought you all into the\nair. \u201cI&rsquo;m alright. Wanda, just move it out.\u201d \u201cYeah yeah.\u201d She\nwaved her fingers and you dug yours into the table as it tore it&rsquo;s\nway out of you through her magic. \u201cThere. All done.\u201d The bullet\nplinked into a bowl and you begun to heal yourself. \u201cDid you get\neverything you needed?\u201d You looked up at Tony who still had his\nback to you. \u201cYeah. We got everything. I take it there were no\nsurvivors.\u201d \u201cNo. We were too late.\u201d You sighed as you pulled\nyour top back up and zipped it. \u201cNevermind that. Are you alright?\u201d\nBucky walked over to you, concern filling his expression as he looked\nover you. \u201cYeah I&rsquo;m fine.\u201d \u201cThat Doctor. Did you remember him?\nFrom your old days?\u201d Steve said and Bucky tightened his hand on\nyours knowing damn well that any mention of your old life upset you.\n\u201cNo. I mean, not really. I remember his face, but I don&rsquo;t remember\nhis name. I remember that he was a friend, and he was there against\nhis will just like I was, but, everything else is blank.\u201d Bucky\nwrapped his arm around your shoulders and you rested your head\nagainst him. \u201cAlright. Let&rsquo;s go home.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Later\nthat night, a familiar knock brought you back from your thoughts as\nyou combed through your hair, just staring out the window. \u201cCome on\nin.\u201d \u201cHey Doll. I brought hot cocoa. Extra marshmallows.\u201d Bucky\ngrinned as he walked over and sat yours on the desk next to you.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d You gave him a weak smile. \u201cHere. Come here.\u201d He\nsat his own cup down, then lead you over to the bed. \u201cTake your\nshirt off and lay down.\u201d You tilted your head in question, but\nfollowed his orders, laying on your stomach. He reached into his\npocket and pulled out a small bottle of warming massage gel. \u201cI\nknow you carry all your stress in your shoulders, and honestly I&rsquo;ve\nbeen wanting to massage your shoulders and your back for months, and\nwell since we fucked last night, I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;m allowed to now.\u201d\nYou chuckled and nodded. \u201cGood luck though. My back&rsquo;s pretty much\njust one giant knot.\u201d \u201cJust relax.\u201d He whispered as he began to\nwork one knot out of your shoulder, causing a little moan to slip\npassed your lips, and he just smiled as he continued working on your\nback. At one point he straddled your ass and moved just right and dug\nhis erection into your ass accidentally, but still causing a grunt of\na moan to come from him. \u201cSorry. You make such pretty sounds. I\ncan&rsquo;t help it.\u201d You grinned and wriggled your ass into him. \u201cNo\nneed to apologize as long as you promise to put it to use.\u201d His\nfingers dug into your sides as he ground into your ass again.\n\u201cWhatever you wish Y/N.\u201d He bent down and bit your shoulder\ncausing you to moan and squirm under him. \u00a0\n</p>",

Come on. Up. Change of plans.\u201d\nYou grumbled and wiggled out of Bucky\u2019s arms, picking up his shirt\nand throwing it on since it was big enough to cover you so you could\nanswer the door with a snarl. \u201cWhat Stark?!\u201d You glared at the\nman and he pushed passed you into your room, freezing in place as he\nsaw Bucky now sitting up in your bed, barely covered with the\nblanket. \u201cWell alright then.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cChange of\nplans. You\u2019re both coming with us to that base in Russia. We\u2019ve got\nsome intelligence that there are plenty of bad guys\u2019 asses for you\nboth to kick. Meet in the hanger ready to go in 20. We\u2019ll fill you\nboth in to the rest of the plan on the way.\u201d \u201cFine Stark. Out.\u201d\nYou held the door open and motioned for him to exit, closing it a bit\nharder than necessary once he was through. You sighed and ran your\nhand across your face as you took a breath, trying to wake yourself\nup. \u201cOk.\u201d You picked up Bucky\u2019s pants and tossed them to him as\nhe stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the hanger.\u201d \u201cAm I getting my\nshirt back?\u201d He smirked and you just shook your head. \u201cNope. Is\nmine now.\u201d You pulled him to you to plant a kiss on his lips, but\nhe pulled you tighter against him and deepened the kiss, squeezing\nyour bare ass with his flesh hand causing you to squeak. He chuckled\nas he released you. \u201cSee you in 20.\u201d \n</p><p>You\nwere still strapping throwing knives into place as you made your way\nup the ramp into the quinjet. \u201cDoll.\u201d You looked up to see Bucky\nalready standing there, ready to go with a cup of coffee held out to\nyou. You smiled and kissed his cheek as you took the cup. \u201cYou\nmight have just saved Tony\u2019s life.\u201d He just chuckled and followed\nyou over to your seat next to Steve. \u201cMornin Y/N. You seem\u2026\nDifferent.\u201d He looks between you and Bucky for a moment. \u201cThey\nfinally hooked up.\u201d Tony stated as he walked over to you. \u201cOh.\nGood.\u201d Steve nodded and you almost choked on your coffee. \u201cDid\neveryone\u2026\u201d \u201cYeah pretty much.\u201d Clint said, passing what\nlooked like a 20 to Natasha. You rolled your eyes and sighed, then\nleaned into Bucky\u2019s side with a shrug. \u201cJust took some of Thor\u2019s\nwhiskey to get me to fess up.\u201d \u201cHa! Told you it\u2019d be her.\u201d\nWanda pointed at Steve. \u201cCan we focus?\u201d Bucky interrupted.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d \u201cYou and Cap are going to be clearing levels\nin front of Wanda and Y/N as they make their way towards the\nbasement\u2026\u201d \u201cWhere the cells are.\u201d You spoke up as Tony\nprovided a holographic map of the building lay out according to your\nmemory. \u201cCorrect. We believe there are a couple of doctors that may\nor may not be willingly helping Hydra.\u201d \u201cNatasha and I are going\nto be getting everything we can out of the computers.\u201d Tony pointed\nto the area where you believed the main computers were. \u201cSure.\nWe\u2019ll do all the hard stuff as usual.\u201d Bucky squeezed your\nshoulders with his arm and you just smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s aight.

Come on. Up. Change of plans.\u201d\nYou grumbled and wiggled out of Bucky\u2019s arms, picking up his shirt\nand throwing it on since it was big enough to cover you so you could\nanswer the door with a snarl. \u201cWhat Stark?!\u201d You glared at the\nman and he pushed passed you into your room, freezing in place as he\nsaw Bucky now sitting up in your bed, barely covered with the\nblanket. \u201cWell alright then.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cChange of\nplans. You\u2019re both coming with us to that base in Russia. We\u2019ve got\nsome intelligence that there are plenty of bad guys\u2019 asses for you\nboth to kick. Meet in the hanger ready to go in 20. We\u2019ll fill you\nboth in to the rest of the plan on the way.\u201d \u201cFine Stark. Out.\u201d\nYou held the door open and motioned for him to exit, closing it a bit\nharder than necessary once he was through. You sighed and ran your\nhand across your face as you took a breath, trying to wake yourself\nup. \u201cOk.\u201d You picked up Bucky\u2019s pants and tossed them to him as\nhe stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the hanger.\u201d \u201cAm I getting my\nshirt back?\u201d He smirked and you just shook your head. \u201cNope. Is\nmine now.\u201d You pulled him to you to plant a kiss on his lips, but\nhe pulled you tighter against him and deepened the kiss, squeezing\nyour bare ass with his flesh hand causing you to squeak. He chuckled\nas he released you. \u201cSee you in 20.\u201d \n</p><p>You\nwere still strapping throwing knives into place as you made your way\nup the ramp into the quinjet. \u201cDoll.\u201d You looked up to see Bucky\nalready standing there, ready to go with a cup of coffee held out to\nyou. You smiled and kissed his cheek as you took the cup. \u201cYou\nmight have just saved Tony\u2019s life.\u201d He just chuckled and followed\nyou over to your seat next to Steve. \u201cMornin Y/N. You seem\u2026\nDifferent.\u201d He looks between you and Bucky for a moment. \u201cThey\nfinally hooked up.\u201d Tony stated as he walked over to you. \u201cOh.\nGood.\u201d Steve nodded and you almost choked on your coffee. \u201cDid\neveryone\u2026\u201d \u201cYeah pretty much.\u201d Clint said, passing what\nlooked like a 20 to Natasha. You rolled your eyes and sighed, then\nleaned into Bucky\u2019s side with a shrug. \u201cJust took some of Thor\u2019s\nwhiskey to get me to fess up.\u201d \u201cHa! Told you it\u2019d be her.\u201d\nWanda pointed at Steve. \u201cCan we focus?\u201d Bucky interrupted.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d \u201cYou and Cap are going to be clearing levels\nin front of Wanda and Y/N as they make their way towards the\nbasement\u2026\u201d \u201cWhere the cells are.\u201d You spoke up as Tony\nprovided a holographic map of the building lay out according to your\nmemory. \u201cCorrect. We believe there are a couple of doctors that may\nor may not be willingly helping Hydra.\u201d \u201cNatasha and I are going\nto be getting everything we can out of the computers.\u201d Tony pointed\nto the area where you believed the main computers were. \u201cSure.\nWe\u2019ll do all the hard stuff as usual.\u201d Bucky squeezed your\nshoulders with his arm and you just smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s aight. We got\nthis.\u201d<br></p><p>You\nspent the rest of the ride sipping your coffee and trying to scour\nyour memory to pinpoint where everything was exactly so there were no\nunnecessary surprises. \u201cDoll?\u201d \u201cHmm?\u201d You didn\u2019t look up from\nthe map. \u201cY/N?\u201d Bucky said softer this time, causing you to meet\nhis eyes. He tilted his head slightly and you nodded, and leaned\nagainst him for a second. \u201cWe got this.\u201d You gave him a\nreassuring smile and returned your attention to the map.<br></p><p>An\nhour later, Clint spoke up from his spot in the pilot\u2019s seat.\n\u201cAlright boys and girls. We\u2019re here.\u201d You walked up and pointed\nto a spot where you knew you could land. \u201cBring her down over\nthere. The door\u2019s right there. We should be able to get in unnoticed\nif we come from this side.\u201d He nodded and silently landed the\nquinjet where you pointed. One final check of weapons, and you all\nfiled out. Tony took the lead, letting his tech scan for heat\nsignatures, motioning to Nat where they were so she could take them\nout quickly and quietly. The door was locked, but it was easy enough\nfor Wanda to use her magic to move the tumblers, and Steve and Bucky\npoured in as soon as the lock clicked, immediately taking out two\nguards just inside. Your team moved silent and deadly through the\nhalls until you made it to the split up point. Tony and Natasha\nducked off to find the computers, and Bucky and Steve started to\ndescend the stairs with you and Wanda following closely behind. The\nboys took out one Hydra operative after another as you all made your\nway down. Finally you came to the door you knew well enough. \u201cOk.\nJust through here.\u201d Muffled screams of agony filled the air then,\nand caused you to flinch, but you quickly shook it off as Wanda\nunlocked this door as easily as she had the first.</p><p>Steve\nand Bucky filed in and opened fire on the soldiers already raising\ntheir guns at you as you flung a knife into the temple of the man\nwith the scalpel standing over the doctor strapped to the chair.\n\u201cFuck you asshole. I told you I\u2019d kill you.\u201d You spat out in\nRussian as you made your way over to the doctor. \u201cHey. You\u2019re the\none that helped me out aren\u2019t you?\u201d You spoke in Russian to the man\nwho nodded, but responded in English. \u201cYes. I don\u2019t know if you\nremember me, but we used to work together. This is the second time\nyou\u2019ve saved my life.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not safe yet.\u201d Bucky barked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201d You began to undo his restraints,\nthen let your magic wash over him, healing his more important wounds.\n\u201cIs there anyone else down here?\u201d Steve said as he kept his eye\non the doorway. \u201cNo. They killed everyone else that let you escape.\nThey were hoping I could tell them where you went.\u201d You sighed.\n\u201cOk. What did you give them?\u201d \u201cI gave up one of your safe\nhouses, but hopefully it\u2019s a dead one.\u201d \u201cMost of them are.\u201d You\nhelped the man stand up and started to lead him out the door.</p><p>Just\nas you passed the threshold a bullet exploded the doctor\u2019s head, and\nhalf a second later, there was a barrel digging into your temple and\none more soldier with his gun to Wanda\u2019s head. \u201cDrop em boys. I\ndon\u2019t want to kill my favorite little toy just yet, but I will.\u201d\nThe man had the gun pressed against your temple and used his other\nhand to slide up your body to grope your breast, then down the front\nof your suit. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Bucky took a half step forward, and the\nman dug the gun into your head further. \u201cAsset?\u201d His voice piqued\nin curiosity. \u201cWell\u2026 Hmm\u2026 two for one. Lucky me.\u201d He grinned\nand began speaking in Russian. \u201cLonging.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Steve took a\nstep this time. \u201cBack off star spangled idiot. I\u2019ll kill them\nboth.\u201d \u201cRusted.\u201d Bucky growled. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d You whispered\nas you pressed your body against his, grinding your ass into his\ncrotch slightly. \u201cPlease let them go. You can keep me.\u201d He\ngrabbed your hair and yanked your head to the side, then growled in\nyour ear. \u201cOh I\u2019m keeping you both baby.\u201d Then licked your neck.\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Seems like someone else has had you recently.\u201d \u201cYeah\nhim!\u201d You slammed your head into his and at the same time, flung a\nknife into the throat of the man holding a gun to Wanda. You spun\naround and kicked the man\u2019s legs out from under him, causing him to\nsqueeze the trigger during his fall, and you quickly shoved a knife\ninto his throat not noticing the bullet had gone into your torso. You\nquickly turned around to make sure everyone else was alright.\n\u201cBucky?! You good?\u201d \u201cDoll\u2026 Patch yourself up before you worry\nabout me.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d You looked down as the adrenaline ceased\nenough that you felt the pain. \u201cOw!\u201d You threw your hand over the\nwound as white light poured from it. \u201cShit. I can\u2019t until we get\nthe bullet out. I\u2019ll be fine though. Nothing major was hit.\u201d<br></p><p>You\nall made it back to the quinjet quickly as you took out the rest of\nthe soldiers you came across, and once inside, Nat and Wanda rushed\nto your side as you pulled your top off, causing Bucky, Steve and\nTony to turn their backs to you as Clint brought you all into the\nair. \u201cI\u2019m alright. Wanda, just move it out.\u201d \u201cYeah yeah.\u201d She\nwaved her fingers and you dug yours into the table as it tore it\u2019s\nway out of you through her magic. \u201cThere. All done.\u201d The bullet\nplinked into a bowl and you begun to heal yourself. \u201cDid you get\neverything you needed?\u201d You looked up at Tony who still had his\nback to you. \u201cYeah. We got everything. I take it there were no\nsurvivors.\u201d \u201cNo. We were too late.\u201d You sighed as you pulled\nyour top back up and zipped it. \u201cNevermind that. Are you alright?\u201d\nBucky walked over to you, concern filling his expression as he looked\nover you. \u201cYeah I\u2019m fine.\u201d \u201cThat Doctor. Did you remember him?\nFrom your old days?\u201d Steve said and Bucky tightened his hand on\nyours knowing damn well that any mention of your old life upset you.\n\u201cNo. I mean, not really. I remember his face, but I don\u2019t remember\nhis name. I remember that he was a friend, and he was there against\nhis will just like I was, but, everything else is blank.\u201d Bucky\nwrapped his arm around your shoulders and you rested your head\nagainst him. \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Later\nthat night, a familiar knock brought you back from your thoughts as\nyou combed through your hair, just staring out the window. \u201cCome on\nin.\u201d \u201cHey Doll. I brought hot cocoa. Extra marshmallows.\u201d Bucky\ngrinned as he walked over and sat yours on the desk next to you.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d You gave him a weak smile. \u201cHere. Come here.\u201d He\nsat his own cup down, then lead you over to the bed. \u201cTake your\nshirt off and lay down.\u201d You tilted your head in question, but\nfollowed his orders, laying on your stomach. He reached into his\npocket and pulled out a small bottle of warming massage gel. \u201cI\nknow you carry all your stress in your shoulders, and honestly I\u2019ve\nbeen wanting to massage your shoulders and your back for months, and\nwell since we fucked last night, I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m allowed to now.\u201d\nYou chuckled and nodded. \u201cGood luck though. My back\u2019s pretty much\njust one giant knot.\u201d \u201cJust relax.\u201d He whispered as he began to\nwork one knot out of your shoulder, causing a little moan to slip\npassed your lips, and he just smiled as he continued working on your\nback. At one point he straddled your ass and moved just right and dug\nhis erection into your ass accidentally, but still causing a grunt of\na moan to come from him. \u201cSorry. You make such pretty sounds. I\ncan\u2019t help it.\u201d You grinned and wriggled your ass into him. \u201cNo\nneed to apologize as long as you promise to put it to use.\u201d His\nfingers dug into your sides as he ground into your ass again.\n\u201cWhatever you wish Y/N.\u201d He bent down and bit your shoulder\ncausing you to moan and squirm under him. \u00a0\n</p></p>",

Thor had sent him a message from Asgard of all places, that the land was under threat and he needed Loki to help him reclaim the throne. That could only mean one thing. His father was dead. It wasn\u2019t even that long ago that Loki could remember wanting that throne for himself. Wanting to take what his father was going to pass on to Thor. Wanting what he knew he would never get. Now\u2026he wanted nothing to do with any of that. All he wanted was you.<br></i></p><p><i>He rested his eyes on you again and a small tear fell down his cheek as you continued to sleep. He wanted to tell you where he was going, what was going on, and more importantly; that he would be back to hold you in his arms once again and that he was going to be back. But it was better not to explain. You wouldn\u2019t let him leave. And he had to, to keep you safe from not only his issues about going to fight his sister, but something else that could come after you. Something that he couldn\u2019t help but think was coming back to haunt him. The dreams that plagued his mind. He might be paranoid, but he wasn\u2019t so sure anymore. Plus, there might have been a reason that his sister was coming to return only now. </i></p><p><i>He rested a small kiss on your forehead as he stroked a tear that had fallen onto your face from his. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you, my queen\u201d he whispered, subconsciously wishing that you would wake up and ask him where he was going, thwarting his plan. But you didn\u2019t stir, and Loki was forced to walk out of the hospital room, stifling a small sob as he hoped and prayed to some unknown force that he would see you again. </i></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p><i>Loki stared up at the titan in front of him, his limbs wanting to give out and just collapse onto the floor. He thought he\u2019d never see him again. He never wanted to see him again. The only person who could compete with a god like him, as much as he\u2019d disliked to admit it. He had a plan in his head as to what he would do. He always had a plan. But this was the first time that he was unsure of what would happen. Would Thanos figure out what he was doing and be one step ahead of him? This was something that was wracking his brain constantly as he stared up at the Titan\u2019s menacing stature and this was when he realised that this was the first time, he\u2019d been holding onto blind faith to keep him alive. </i></p><p><i>Loki looked over at Thor, and placed one single mental thought into Thor\u2019s mind, in order for him to hold onto something good.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you brother. Please, look after them\u201d he projected as he held out the tesseract in front of the person he\u2019d feared most in the world, preparing to die\u2026</i></p><hr><p>You kept telling yourself it couldn\u2019t be true. He was alright. What Thor had told you wasn\u2019t true. He was okay. He was safe. This wasn\u2019t true\u2026</p><p>This wasn\u2019t true\u2026</p><p>You sobbed a little but mostly maintained quiet. You felt numb. You couldn\u2019t feel anything. You wanted to think about his face. The curves and the edges that made up his beautiful features but you couldn\u2019t. Thinking about his face and how desperately you wanted to see him, talk to him, touch him. It all hurt too much.</p><p>He promised you he\u2019d be there. He promised. And you\u2019d promised him. Why couldn\u2019t you have been there? Why weren\u2019t you together?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Y/N\u201d Thor had said, although you were barely acknowledging his presence. His voice was mostly white noise as your brain had become a stormy sea, making you unsure of where to go and whether you\u2019d survive. Everything was left up to chance and you were scared of what you were going to do. He was gone\u2026Loki was gone.</p><p>You\u2019d begun to register what was happening and a loud sob wracked through your body. Pain begun to flow through your arms and legs and chest not only from your injuries, but from a pain much greater than you\u2019d been suffering the past few weeks. Thor started to cry as well, and he held you in his arms, completely engulfing you in his massive arms. You appreciated it. But it wasn't\u2019t the same as him. God, it wasn\u2019t the same.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll pay for what he\u2019s done Y/N\u201d Thor choked \u201cI promise\u201d, and you continued to sob into his chest. You had no idea what you\u2019d do now, but you knew one thing. You continued to let every single ounce of pain flow through your body and out through your mouth into chokes sobs and screams as you said the only thing that you could express at this point, your short screams being released in between your words.</p><p>\u201cMake\u2026him\u2026pay\u201d</p><hr><h2><b>Tag List</b></h2><p><a

Thor had sent him a message from Asgard of all places, that the land was under threat and he needed Loki to help him reclaim the throne. That could only mean one thing. His father was dead. It wasn&rsquo;t even that long ago that Loki could remember wanting that throne for himself. Wanting to take what his father was going to pass on to Thor. Wanting what he knew he would never get. Now&hellip;he wanted nothing to do with any of that. All he wanted was you.<br /></i></p><p><i>He rested his eyes on you again and a small tear fell down his cheek as you continued to sleep. He wanted to tell you where he was going, what was going on, and more importantly; that he would be back to hold you in his arms once again and that he was going to be back. But it was better not to explain. You wouldn&rsquo;t let him leave. And he had to, to keep you safe from not only his issues about going to fight his sister, but something else that could come after you. Something that he couldn&rsquo;t help but think was coming back to haunt him. The dreams that plagued his mind. He might be paranoid, but he wasn&rsquo;t so sure anymore. Plus, there might have been a reason that his sister was coming to return only now. </i></p><p><i>He rested a small kiss on your forehead as he stroked a tear that had fallen onto your face from his. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you, my queen&rdquo; he whispered, subconsciously wishing that you would wake up and ask him where he was going, thwarting his plan. But you didn&rsquo;t stir, and Loki was forced to walk out of the hospital room, stifling a small sob as he hoped and prayed to some unknown force that he would see you again. </i></p><hr /><p><i>Loki stared up at the titan in front of him, his limbs wanting to give out and just collapse onto the floor. He thought he&rsquo;d never see him again. He never wanted to see him again. The only person who could compete with a god like him, as much as he&rsquo;d disliked to admit it. He had a plan in his head as to what he would do. He always had a plan. But this was the first time that he was unsure of what would happen. Would Thanos figure out what he was doing and be one step ahead of him? This was something that was wracking his brain constantly as he stared up at the Titan&rsquo;s menacing stature and this was when he realised that this was the first time, he&rsquo;d been holding onto blind faith to keep him alive. </i></p><p><i>Loki looked over at Thor, and placed one single mental thought into Thor&rsquo;s mind, in order for him to hold onto something good.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you brother. Please, look after them&rdquo; he projected as he held out the tesseract in front of the person he&rsquo;d feared most in the world, preparing to die&hellip;</i></p><hr /><p>You kept telling yourself it couldn&rsquo;t be true. He was alright. What Thor had told you wasn&rsquo;t true. He was okay. He was safe. This wasn&rsquo;t true&hellip;</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t true&hellip;</p><p>You sobbed a little but mostly maintained quiet. You felt numb. You couldn&rsquo;t feel anything. You wanted to think about his face. The curves and the edges that made up his beautiful features but you couldn&rsquo;t. Thinking about his face and how desperately you wanted to see him, talk to him, touch him. It all hurt too much.</p><p>He promised you he&rsquo;d be there. He promised. And you&rsquo;d promised him. Why couldn&rsquo;t you have been there? Why weren&rsquo;t you together?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Y/N&rdquo; Thor had said, although you were barely acknowledging his presence. His voice was mostly white noise as your brain had become a stormy sea, making you unsure of where to go and whether you&rsquo;d survive. Everything was left up to chance and you were scared of what you were going to do. He was gone&hellip;Loki was gone.</p><p>You&rsquo;d begun to register what was happening and a loud sob wracked through your body. Pain begun to flow through your arms and legs and chest not only from your injuries, but from a pain much greater than you&rsquo;d been suffering the past few weeks. Thor started to cry as well, and he held you in his arms, completely engulfing you in his massive arms. You appreciated it. But it wasn't&rsquo;t the same as him. God, it wasn&rsquo;t the same.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pay for what he&rsquo;s done Y/N&rdquo; Thor choked &ldquo;I promise&rdquo;, and you continued to sob into his chest. You had no idea what you&rsquo;d do now, but you knew one thing. You continued to let every single ounce of pain flow through your body and out through your mouth into chokes sobs and screams as you said the only thing that you could express at this point, your short screams being released in between your words.</p><p>&ldquo;Make&hellip;him&hellip;pay&rdquo;</p><hr /><h2><b>Tag List</b></h2><p><a

Plus, there might have been a reason that his sister was coming to return only now. </i></p>\n<p><i>He rested a small kiss on your forehead as he stroked a tear that had fallen onto your face from his. </i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;I love you, my queen&rdquo; he whispered, subconsciously wishing that you would wake up and ask him where he was going, thwarting his plan. But you didn&rsquo;t stir, and Loki was forced to walk out of the hospital room, stifling a small sob as he hoped and prayed to some unknown force that he would see you again. </i></p>\n</p>",
