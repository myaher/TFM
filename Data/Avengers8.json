There was some difficulty due to her age, but she had the ID and made sure the date there matched with the date of the appointment. Finally, she was making it happened.<br/></p><p>She showed up 30 minutes before the actual appointment, 10 before what was recommended. She caught the eye of the artist she had been in contact with quickly, who smiled a bit as he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cA little excited to have a needle jabbed into your arm?\u201d The man asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cPatience isn\u2019t really my strong suit,\u201d she explained, \u201cMy mom says I get it from my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell lucky for you, my earlier appointment went quicker than expected, so I can take you back right now. Happy Birthday by the way.\u201d<br/></p><p>She smiled, granting the artist a\u00a0\u2018thank you\u2019 and happily followed the older man behind the counter to the area that he would be doing the tattoo. He pulled out a table for her to lie down on, which she eagerly hopped on to.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring anyone with you?\u201d The tattoo artist was used to first-time tattoo getters bringing someone along with them, especially ones as young as her.<br/></p><p>\u201cNah. The only person I\u2019d bring is my mom, and as much as she says she likes what I\u2019m getting, tattoos aren\u2019t really her thing. Maybe my kinda older brother, but he\u2019s got a million other things going on right now. And I don\u2019t mind getting this on my own. It feels right,\u201d she explained. The artist nodded, pretending to really understand what the young girl was saying, as he looked through his drawer before pulling out the design he had made for her.<br/></p><p>\u201cMom doesn\u2019t approve?\u201d The artist laughed a little, used to seeing 18-year-olds come in against their parent&rsquo;s wishes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she loves the idea of me getting a tattoo in general, but she knows what I\u2019m getting, and I know she stopped protesting as soon as I told her what it was I was going to get. I think she even likes it.\u201d The girl pondered what he mom would be saying if she was in the shop with her now, and laughed a bit at the idea of her mom, who always seemed calm and collected and cared about keeping a good face, as trying to do the same watching her 18-year-old daughter getting a tattoo.<br/></p><p>\u201cLast chance, this is what you want, correct? Nothing you want to change at all?\u201d The girl looked at the sketch he had made closely. She wanted to keep it fairly simple, figuring it was easier to go back and add stuff if she really wanted rather than vice versa, but she had dictated that at their last session when they were working on the design together.<br/></p><p>\u201cYup, that\u2019s perfect. And I still want it on my inner right bicep.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll press on the outline just to make sure it\u2019s perfect, and then we\u2019ll get started.\u201d She nodded at his statement, reaching her arm out to put the outline on her arm. After looking at it at every angle she could, she agreed that it was in the spot she wanted, and lied down for the tattoo session to start.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna feel a bit of a sting, but it shouldn\u2019t hurt too bad where you\u2019re getting it. If it starts to hurt too bad, let me know and we can take a break.\u201d The artist said this as he already started the needle, causing her to hear the buzzing. She could immediately feel the needle on her arm when she started. It was definitely not a comfortable feeling, but the pain wasn\u2019t awful either. She just focused on her breathing and waited for it to be done. She had zoned out a bit until she heard the artist say something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou would have been pretty young when he died, right?\u201d The artist asked. For a second she wasn\u2019t sure what he was talking about, but the remembered the arc reactor part of the tattoo and sighed a bit.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, I was four when he died,\u201d She told him, not willingly giving any more information. The artist whistled.</p><p>\u201cWow, you <i>were</i>\u00a0young. Pretty cool though, what he did&hellip;\u201d The artist continued to talk, but the young girl quickly tuned out, already having heard a million times about how great a sacrifice Iron Man made to save the rest of the Universe. She understood it, of course, she did. She wouldn\u2019t have a lot of her family, including her pseudo-brother, without that sacrifice, but that didn\u2019t make her wish it didn\u2019t happen some times any less.<br/></p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he have a daughter?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d The girl responded, trying to check back into the conversation.<br/></p><p>\u201cTony Stark. Didn\u2019t he have a daughter?\u201d The artist expanded. The girl thought for a second before answering.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so. I think she would have been around my age.\u201d The tattoo artist nodded at the girl&rsquo;s response but picked up on the fact that she didn\u2019t really seem to want to talk. He returned to the almost completed work on her arm in silence, letting her ponder her own thoughts.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, all finished,\u201d The artist said a few minutes later.<br/></p><p>\u201cReally? That quick?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYup, writing doesn\u2019t usually take super long, especially with such a short quotation, and the arc reactor was pretty quick as well.\u201d As the artist explained it, she jumped off the table to look at the tattoo in the mirror. A smile quickly grew on her face as she switched between looking at it directly and in the mirror.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d She says,\u00a0\u201cExactly what I wanted.\u201d<br/></p><p>The artist quickly wraps her arm up and gives her all the tattoo care instructions that she needs. After she pays him, including a more than generous tip, she leaves the tattoo shop, walking to her car to drive home.</p><p>She paused a second on the way to the car, looking down at the bandage on her arm. Although she couldn\u2019t see it, Morgan could picture the tattoo underneath it perfectly. It was dedicated to her dad, something they used to say to each other when she was little, and what he left at the end of every holographic message he had left her after he died so long ago.</p><p>On her upper right bicep, the same arm her father had used to destroy Thanos and his army, Morgan Stark had, in Tony Stark\u2019s handwriting,\u00a0\u2018I love you 3000\u2032. Underneath that, was his arc reactor, the original one, the one that proved that Tony Stark had a heart. A heart that was now carried and seen in his daughter, carrying on his legacy.</p>",

She wouldn\u2019t have a lot of her family, including her pseudo-brother, without that sacrifice, but that didn\u2019t make her wish it didn\u2019t happen some times any less.<br></p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he have a daughter?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d The girl responded, trying to check back into the conversation.<br></p><p>\u201cTony Stark. Didn\u2019t he have a daughter?\u201d The artist expanded. The girl thought for a second before answering.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so. I think she would have been around my age.\u201d The tattoo artist nodded at the girl\u2019s response but picked up on the fact that she didn\u2019t really seem to want to talk. He returned to the almost completed work on her arm in silence, letting her ponder her own thoughts.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, all finished,\u201d The artist said a few minutes later.<br></p><p>\u201cReally? That quick?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYup, writing doesn\u2019t usually take super long, especially with such a short quotation, and the arc reactor was pretty quick as well.\u201d As the artist explained it, she jumped off the table to look at the tattoo in the mirror. A smile quickly grew on her face as she switched between looking at it directly and in the mirror.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d She says,\u00a0\u201cExactly what I wanted.\u201d<br></p><p>The artist quickly wraps her arm up and gives her all the tattoo care instructions that she needs. After she pays him, including a more than generous tip, she leaves the tattoo shop, walking to her car to drive home.</p><p>She paused a second on the way to the car, looking down at the bandage on her arm. Although she couldn\u2019t see it, Morgan could picture the tattoo underneath it perfectly. It was dedicated to her dad, something they used to say to each other when she was little, and what he left at the end of every holographic message he had left her after he died so long ago.</p><p>On her upper right bicep, the same arm her father had used to destroy Thanos and his army, Morgan Stark had, in Tony Stark\u2019s handwriting,\u00a0\u2018I love you 3000\u2032. Underneath that, was his arc reactor, the original one, the one that proved that Tony Stark had a heart. A heart that was now carried and seen in his daughter, carrying on his legacy.</p>",

Happy Birthday by the way.\u201d<br></p><p>She smiled, granting the artist a\u00a0\u2018thank you\u2019 and happily followed the older man behind the counter to the area that he would be doing the tattoo. He pulled out a table for her to lie down on, which she eagerly hopped on to.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring anyone with you?\u201d The tattoo artist was used to first-time tattoo getters bringing someone along with them, especially ones as young as her.<br></p><p>\u201cNah. The only person I\u2019d bring is my mom, and as much as she says she likes what I\u2019m getting, tattoos aren\u2019t really her thing. Maybe my kinda older brother, but he\u2019s got a million other things going on right now. And I don\u2019t mind getting this on my own. It feels right,\u201d she explained. The artist nodded, pretending to really understand what the young girl was saying, as he looked through his drawer before pulling out the design he had made for her.<br></p><p>\u201cMom doesn\u2019t approve?\u201d The artist laughed a little, used to seeing 18-year-olds come in against their parent\u2019s wishes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she loves the idea of me getting a tattoo in general, but she knows what I\u2019m getting, and I know she stopped protesting as soon as I told her what it was I was going to get. I think she even likes it.\u201d The girl pondered what he mom would be saying if she was in the shop with her now, and laughed a bit at the idea of her mom, who always seemed calm and collected and cared about keeping a good face, as trying to do the same watching her 18-year-old daughter getting a tattoo.<br></p><p>\u201cLast chance, this is what you want, correct? Nothing you want to change at all?\u201d The girl looked at the sketch he had made closely. She wanted to keep it fairly simple, figuring it was easier to go back and add stuff if she really wanted rather than vice versa, but she had dictated that at their last session when they were working on the design together.<br></p><p>\u201cYup, that\u2019s perfect. And I still want it on my inner right bicep.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll press on the outline just to make sure it\u2019s perfect, and then we\u2019ll get started.\u201d She nodded at his statement, reaching her arm out to put the outline on her arm. After looking at it at every angle she could, she agreed that it was in the spot she wanted, and lied down for the tattoo session to start.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna feel a bit of a sting, but it shouldn\u2019t hurt too bad where you\u2019re getting it. If it starts to hurt too bad, let me know and we can take a break.\u201d The artist said this as he already started the needle, causing her to hear the buzzing. She could immediately feel the needle on her arm when she started. It was definitely not a comfortable feeling, but the pain wasn\u2019t awful either. She just focused on her breathing and waited for it to be done. She had zoned out a bit until she heard the artist say something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked.<br></p><p>\u201cYou would have been pretty young when he died, right?\u201d The artist asked. For a second she wasn\u2019t sure what he was talking about, but the remembered the arc reactor part of the tattoo and sighed a bit.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I was four when he died,\u201d She told him, not willingly giving any more information.

Would this mission be your last? You never knew, and it was scary. Now, as Peter prepared to join you, it haunted you more than ever. </p><p>\u201cYou ready Pete?\u201d You asked with a smile.</p><p>It was his first mission, it wasn\u2019t anything to big but it was big enough to scare him. </p><p>\u201cI guess..\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019ll do great. You\u2019re Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed a little and nodded his head, giving you a small smile as he grabbed his mask from his seat. Peter went to walk past you but stopped, giving you one last worried look.</p><p>\u201cPeter, you can do this.\u201d </p><p>He nodded and ran off to go join Tony and Thor. You left to go join Steve and Nat. Clint landed the jet, getting ready, you ran out straight into the chaos.</p><p>It was a trap, you were instantly ambushed. A simple mission suddenly became life and death and all you could think about was Peter. </p><p>\u201cNat!

You turned to the group surrounding you, reloading your guns as you grinned.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>They were easy enough to take down, having done this a thousand times. Healing the small wounds you got, you looked around. There was fires all over the place and it was becoming hard to breath. Turning around, you made the mistake of turning your back to the enemy, you didn\u2019t even hear anything but you sure as hell felt it. </p><p>Dropping to your knees, your hands flew to your stomach. You could feel the blood seeping out. You heard laughter, and shot in that direction, hearing a body hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cGuys?\u201d You coughed.</p><p>Smoked rained down all around you, everything was silent. It should be silent. Blood was still flowing through your fingers.</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d You called again.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d </p><p>Steve dropped to his knees, placing his hand on your shoulder as he check you over. You coughed again, a little bit of blood coming up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Hey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY.. yeah&hellip; yeah&hellip; I\u2019ll heal..\u201d</p><p>He glanced at you in worry and you saw something flash across his face. Carefully, Steve laid you down so your head rested in his lap. You could feel the edges of your wound begin to slowly close.</p><p>\u201cGuy, (Y/N)s hit. Meet us by the entrance.\u201d</p><p>Soon one by one, every stood around you. All holding the same looks as Steve. Your wound was taking longer than you thought to heal. With hazy vision, you spotted Tony and Peter weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cG&hellip; Guys&hellip; Pete? Where\u2019s Pete?\u201d</p><p>Clint and Nat shared a look. The thud of Tony\u2019s suit hitting the floor echoed and they stepped aside to let him through. Your eyes landed on his sad face and the body in his arms. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no, no, no&hellip; Tony place him on the floor.\u201d </p><p>Tony gave you a regretful looked and did as you asked. With a pained yelled, you sat up, crawling over to him. Pulling of his mask, his face was fine. As your hand trained down his body you brought it back up to his lungs.</p><p>\u201cHe fell and he.. he punctured his lung..\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo&hellip; Pete? Peter? Hey, talk to me please&hellip; please&hellip;\u201d </p><p>Tears welled up in your eyes, without thinking you placed your hands over his chest. The others begun to protest but you ignored them. A white light flowed into Peters chest, you coughed even more blood as you put everything you had into healing him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to heal yourself!\u201d Clint yelled.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), you\u2019ll die!\u201d Steve yelled.</p><p>Shaking your head, you gasped for air, feeling overwhelmed by pain and exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip; I can\u2019t let him&hellip; I can\u2019t&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Peter bolted up right taking in deep breathes of air as you fell backwards. Everyone screaming your name. You over did it, there was no way you could heal yourself as well.</p><p>\u201cYou need to heal yourself!\u201d Nat yelled as she dropped by yourside, \u201cCome on little spider, heal yourself and we\u2019ll head home.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip; I can\u2019t&hellip; I can\u2019t&hellip; I\u2019m so sorry&hellip; I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You cried. </p><p>You saw the horror wash over her as she took in what you said, her hand flying to her mouth. A stray tear hit your face as she leaned down to kiss your head before leaning to your ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you&hellip;\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Nat..\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Nat stood up. Letting the others say goodbye while Peter stood there with a confused face. By the time he kneeled by you, your chest was barely moving and you were soaked with blood.</p><p>\u201c(Y&hellip;y/n)?\u201d </p><p>\u201cH.. hey&hellip;\u201d you weakly whispered. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t see him, your vision had gone. But you wouldn\u2019t tell him that. You felt his hand on your face and smiled a little.</p><p>\u201cW..why aren\u2019t you&hellip;? If you don\u2019t you\u2019ll&hellip;\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, trailing a hand slowly up his arm to find his face.</p><p>\u201cI love you&hellip; I\u2019m so&hellip; sorry Pete, but this is it&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cN&hellip; no! (N/N) please.. please don\u2019t leave me!\u201d He cried.</p><p>Peters head fell onto your chest, and with great effort you moved your hand to rest in his hair. You shivered, still not dropping the soft smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cS&hellip;say it&hellip;\u201d you whispered, \u201cPete&hellip; say it&hellip; please&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at you, blood trailing down your chin, a soft smile on your lips, eyes gazing blankly at the sky. Skin deathly pale, he could feel you shoved under your touch, your heartbeat was barely there and your breathing was far to slow. Wiping the tears from his face, Peter leaned closer, pressing his lips to your forehead as more tears fell. God, you were so cold. </p><p>\u201cI love you&hellip; I love you so much&hellip;\u201d he whispered. </p><p>Peter pressed another kiss to your head, pressing his forehead against yours as he sobbed. He felt the life leave your body, and he cried even harder, bringing your limp form to his chest as he cried into the crook of your neck. </p><p>He used to think it was silly when people said they felt someone else die, but he felt it. He felt you take your last breath, he felt your heart beat for the last time, seen you smile for the last time, heard your voice for the final time. </p><p>As Peter held you there, cradling your cold body, tears running down his face as the other avengers stood their with sadness in the air, he wished he had told you sooner. He wished he could turn back time and do it all again </p><p><b>TAGS:</b></p><p><b>Marvel: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9IG9or10RLaitEB164BUnw\">@emiwrites3reads</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m80dnCdceI_C9j_p_VZwpmg\">@captainmarvel16</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJodppqNd8TjxGEwf_K82Q\">@darth-dorle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgkzWi8hDIOSplw9YP_bxxA\">@stiffinme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> </b></p><p><b>All: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTXw802GfFiajvfnTlfkDGA\">@sitkafay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLNlSC5_0mUL9xfUnMFoEow\">@havlindzk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maGXq6I3u6ntndOHA93lpFw\">@drakelover78</a> </b></p>",

You coughed again, a little bit of blood coming up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Hey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY.. yeah\u2026 yeah\u2026 I\u2019ll heal..\u201d</p><p>He glanced at you in worry and you saw something flash across his face. Carefully, Steve laid you down so your head rested in his lap. You could feel the edges of your wound begin to slowly close.</p><p>\u201cGuy, (Y/N)s hit. Meet us by the entrance.\u201d</p><p>Soon one by one, every stood around you. All holding the same looks as Steve. Your wound was taking longer than you thought to heal. With hazy vision, you spotted Tony and Peter weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cG\u2026 Guys\u2026 Pete? Where\u2019s Pete?\u201d</p><p>Clint and Nat shared a look. The thud of Tony\u2019s suit hitting the floor echoed and they stepped aside to let him through. Your eyes landed on his sad face and the body in his arms. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no, no, no\u2026 Tony place him on the floor.\u201d </p><p>Tony gave you a regretful looked and did as you asked. With a pained yelled, you sat up, crawling over to him. Pulling of his mask, his face was fine. As your hand trained down his body you brought it back up to his lungs.</p><p>\u201cHe fell and he.. he punctured his lung..\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Pete? Peter? Hey, talk to me please\u2026 please\u2026\u201d </p><p>Tears welled up in your eyes, without thinking you placed your hands over his chest. The others begun to protest but you ignored them. A white light flowed into Peters chest, you coughed even more blood as you put everything you had into healing him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to heal yourself!\u201d Clint yelled.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), you\u2019ll die!\u201d Steve yelled.</p><p>Shaking your head, you gasped for air, feeling overwhelmed by pain and exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t let him\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter bolted up right taking in deep breathes of air as you fell backwards. Everyone screaming your name. You over did it, there was no way you could heal yourself as well.</p><p>\u201cYou need to heal yourself!\u201d Nat yelled as she dropped by yourside, \u201cCome on little spider, heal yourself and we\u2019ll head home.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You cried. </p><p>You saw the horror wash over her as she took in what you said, her hand flying to her mouth. A stray tear hit your face as she leaned down to kiss your head before leaning to your ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Nat..\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Nat stood up. Letting the others say goodbye while Peter stood there with a confused face. By the time he kneeled by you, your chest was barely moving and you were soaked with blood.</p><p>\u201c(Y\u2026y/n)?\u201d </p><p>\u201cH.. hey\u2026\u201d you weakly whispered. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t see him, your vision had gone. But you wouldn\u2019t tell him that. You felt his hand on your face and smiled a little.</p><p>\u201cW..why aren\u2019t you\u2026? If you don\u2019t you\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, trailing a hand slowly up his arm to find his face.</p><p>\u201cI love you\u2026 I\u2019m so\u2026 sorry Pete, but this is it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cN\u2026 no! (N/N) please.. please don\u2019t leave me!\u201d He cried.</p><p>Peters head fell onto your chest, and with great effort you moved your hand to rest in his hair. You shivered, still not dropping the soft smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cS\u2026say it\u2026\u201d you whispered, \u201cPete\u2026 say it\u2026 please\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at you, blood trailing down your chin, a soft smile on your lips, eyes gazing blankly at the sky. Skin deathly pale, he could feel you shoved under your touch, your heartbeat was barely there and your breathing was far to slow. Wiping the tears from his face, Peter leaned closer, pressing his lips to your forehead as more tears fell. God, you were so cold. </p><p>\u201cI love you\u2026 I love you so much\u2026\u201d he whispered. </p><p>Peter pressed another kiss to your head, pressing his forehead against yours as he sobbed. He felt the life leave your body, and he cried even harder, bringing your limp form to his chest as he cried into the crook of your neck. </p><p>He used to think it was silly when people said they felt someone else die, but he felt it. He felt you take your last breath, he felt your heart beat for the last time, seen you smile for the last time, heard your voice for the final time. </p><p>As Peter held you there, cradling your cold body, tears running down his face as the other avengers stood their with sadness in the air, he wished he had told you sooner. He wished he could turn back time and do it all again </p><p><b>TAGS:</b></p><p><b>Marvel: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9IG9or10RLaitEB164BUnw\">@emiwrites3reads</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m80dnCdceI_C9j_p_VZwpmg\">@captainmarvel16</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJodppqNd8TjxGEwf_K82Q\">@darth-dorle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgkzWi8hDIOSplw9YP_bxxA\">@stiffinme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> </b></p><p><b>All: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTXw802GfFiajvfnTlfkDGA\">@sitkafay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLNlSC5_0mUL9xfUnMFoEow\">@havlindzk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maGXq6I3u6ntndOHA93lpFw\">@drakelover78</a> </b></p></p>",

Would this mission be your last? You never knew, and it was scary. Now, as Peter prepared to join you, it haunted you more than ever. </p><p>&ldquo;You ready Pete?&rdquo; You asked with a smile.</p><p>It was his first mission, it wasn&rsquo;t anything to big but it was big enough to scare him. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess..&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;ll do great. You&rsquo;re Spider-Man!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter laughed a little and nodded his head, giving you a small smile as he grabbed his mask from his seat. Peter went to walk past you but stopped, giving you one last worried look.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you can do this.&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded and ran off to go join Tony and Thor. You left to go join Steve and Nat. Clint landed the jet, getting ready, you ran out straight into the chaos.</p><p>It was a trap, you were instantly ambushed. A simple mission suddenly became life and death and all you could think about was Peter. </p><p>&ldquo;Nat! You go, I&rsquo;ve got this!&rdquo; </p><p>The redhead turned to you, her eyes glistening with worry. </p><p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was trained by the best.&rdquo; You winked.</p><p>Laughing she nodded, knocking out the guy behind her before leaving you alone. You turned to the group surrounding you, reloading your guns as you grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s dance.&rdquo;</p><p>They were easy enough to take down, having done this a thousand times. Healing the small wounds you got, you looked around. There was fires all over the place and it was becoming hard to breath. Turning around, you made the mistake of turning your back to the enemy, you didn&rsquo;t even hear anything but you sure as hell felt it. </p><p>Dropping to your knees, your hands flew to your stomach. You could feel the blood seeping out.
