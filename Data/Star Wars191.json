        "body": "<p>KYLO REN&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/></p><p>Kylo Ren\u2019s uncharacteristically good mood persisted over the next couple weeks, which only made everyone who came in contact with him uncomfortable. No one quite knew how to respond to his more relaxed, uplifted attitude. It was well-known within the First Order that Kylo Ren was as serious as they come, with a raging temper to match when provoked. He was not a man to be trifled with, but even more so, he was not a man known for being happy. Ever. </p><!-- more --><p>Sometimes he was met with suspicion, especially when it came to General Hux. Being the type of man who ascended to his coveted position through less than favorable methods, Armitage assumed there were secret operations that he wasn\u2019t privy to, and that made him nervous. While it was not as Hux feared, Kylo couldn\u2019t help exploiting his suspicions for the time being. Armitage shared more detailed information in his reports than he had previously, clearly trying to demonstrate everything he has accomplished on behalf of the First Order. The additional insight was particularly helpful as it gave away more details about Hux\u2019s comings and goings which, in turn, Kylo passed along to his knights while they continued to monitor him.</p><p>Secretly, the only two people in the galaxy who knew the source of his new attitude were himself and Rey.</p><p>While he had waited with Rey as she recovered from the attack by the bounty hunters, Kylo had witnessed something that truly moved him at his core. While caught between an open Force bond and an interruption from that Resistance scum, Rey had done more for Kylo\u2019s ego in a brief second than anyone had in years. When she withdrew her hand from the golden boy of the Resistance, Dameron knew it for what it was - rejection. Little did he know that resting in Rey\u2019s other hand was Kylo\u2019s, one that she had intentionally reached for and encouraged to stay. She had chosen him. Once again, like she had when she arrived on the Supremacy, Rey had chosen him and that meant more to Kylo than he cared to admit. Throughout his life, no one had shown as much support as Rey had in those two moments. Yes, Snoke had been supportive of him, encouraging his studies of the Darkside, but there was always a hidden agenda. With Rey, there were no strings attached.</p><p>Despite Snoke connecting them through the Force, the bond had remained open. It was the Force at work. Kylo knew it. The Force wants balance restored to the galaxy. Maybe, just maybe, he was moving one step closer to accomplishing it. Rey\u2019s request for him to stay by her side fueled his belief that she would join him. Could it be that the vision he saw when they touched hands would come to pass? Kylo certainly hoped so. </p><p>She was his equal in the Force, her light being the perfect counterbalance to his darkness. If she would allow it, Kylo would still jump at the opportunity to provide her with proper training in the Force. He would show her all the power that the Darkside could offer and while he didn\u2019t agree with the strict and stunted dogma of the Jedi teachings, there was still plenty to gain from their practice. Kylo would take the best teachings from both the Jedi and the Sith to begin a new era of Force users. Some students would foster more light than darkness or vice versa, and that would be okay. Never again would a Force-user be trained to shun part of who they were.</p><p>The thought of this new order and the potential for future Force-sensitives only propelled his unusually good mood leading him to think more about Rey. He wondered what she would think of his plan to balance the galaxy. Would she like it? Would she want to be a part of it? </p><p>Truth be told, he had no idea. </p><p>During the brief moments when their bond had opened, neither of them would discuss their personal aspirations, choosing instead to stick with safer conversation topics. After what happened almost a year ago, it was clear that neither of them was as trusting of one another as they once were. That same trust would take time to build. Kylo hoped that it would happen sooner rather than later, which brought his thought back to the task at hand: forcing their bond to open at will.</p><p>Kylo had been meditating on the Force in his quarters while using Vader\u2019s mask as an aid to channel his power. He always found that it was easier to concentrate in the presence of his grandfather\u2019s mask, as if Anakin Skywalker himself was guiding him.</p><p>Sometimes he would plea to his grandfather\u2019s spirit to show him the ways of the Force, and today was no different. Kylo had been attempting to open the bond for a little over an hour, only to hit an impenetrable wall every time he found Rey\u2019s presence in the Force. Her signature shown in the Force with an intensity that rivaled the brightest star in the galaxy. Time and time again, when he felt just a little closer to opening the bond, his concentration would crumble, the effort often drawing his strength away.</p><p>But despite his failed attempts, he kept trying. Since it reopened, he could feel it getting stronger and stronger every time they were connected. They could now see each other&rsquo;s surroundings, a feat they were unable to do previously. It also seemed as though their emotions could bleed through the bond at unexpected times. He will never forget the fear that pierced his heart when she called his name across the stars moments before she was captured.</p><p>It was these revelations that kept him going, that persuaded him to keep trying.</p><p>Once again, he focused on his breathing. The feeling of life-giving oxygen passing in and out of his lungs felt like a life-line that helped center his thoughts. If there was anything the Jedi got right, it was their insistence that proper breathing techniques enhanced the meditating experience. </p><p>When he finally felt as though his mind had been cleared and tranquility hung around him, he opened himself up to the living Force, pleading with it to show him the key to opening the bond he shared with Rey.</p><p><i>Breathe in and out</i>, he thought exhaling slowly.</p><p>Slowly, the darkness that surrounded him began to reveal a faint glow, and from what his heightened senses told him, it was light years away. </p><p>When he was sure this was what he was looking for, Kylo refocused his efforts so that all of his thoughts were directed at this small glowing presence in the Force, encouraging it to blossom. Warmth spread through his body, beginning at the crown of his head and moving down to his toes. The feeling reminded him of the warm summers he spent by the lakes on Chandrila - welcoming and at the same time thrilling. </p><p>Soon enough, what was once a faint glow in the darkness was now a light that shown with the intensity of the Chandrila sun. The fervor of it all made his skin crawl with excitement. It made him feel alive.</p><p>\u201cRey,\u201d he breathed. The light she carried within her was so strong. She was the galaxy\u2019s counter to the darkness he possessed.</p><p>After pausing a few moments to admire the strength of her Force signature, he went right to work summoning his energy, and began slowly pressing it against hers. </p><p>\u201cOpen,\u201d he said in an almost inaudible whisper.</p><p>Upon his command, he sensed that the walls which separated them began to dissolve, but like the intensity of the light, they too were also strong. All of Kylo\u2019s efforts were aimed at one thing and one thing only, slowly chipping away at the Force\u2019s barrier. But just as soon as he began the task at hand, his exhaustion overtook his concentration and he awoke to find himself sitting before his grandfather\u2019s mask, cold and alone once more.</p><p>He let out a growl of frustration. He had been so close this time. He could feel it. </p><p>Unable to control his emotions, he reached for the nearest object he could find - his data pad - \u00a0and hurled into the wall, showering the room with glass and metal pieces. He stood there savagely drawing in one ragged breath after another as the blood in his veins continued to boil. </p><p><i>Why can\u2019t I get it to open?,</i> he thought. <i>I am the most powerful Darkside user in the entire galaxy, the scion to the mighty Skywalker line, trained in both the light and the dark. </i></p><p>Just as he reached for another object, an unexpected knock came from the door to his chambers.</p><p>In his rage, he had almost forgotten that he summoned his knights to report on Hux\u2019s comings and goings. </p><p><i>Kriff</i>, he thought.</p><p>He collected himself for a brief moment before permitting his knights to enter his personal chambers. He did not want them to witness his weakness. A man who cannot control his emotions is not fit to lead the First Order. If they saw him in a state of weakness, surely his knights too would doubt his ability to command the Knights of Ren.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Kylo used the Force to slide the door open. \u201cYou may enter,\u201d he said, trying his best to keep his voice level. </p><p>Jaster and Kasari Ren stepped over the threshold, the lightsabers at their hips clinking against their armour. They proceeded until they were within a few paces from where Kylo stood. Both of them slowly dropped to their knees and bowed their heads in a display of respect for the Master of the Knights of Ren. </p><p>Kylo had been itching to hear this week\u2019s report from his knights. Ever since he ordered Jaster and Kasari to shadow Hux, their findings had been less than he had hoped. From what they could tell, Hux maintained a normal schedule, free from unusual diversions. If it did change, it was for a trivial endeavor, such as a follow-up meeting with an officer or a casual trip to fill an extra cup of caf while he worked. Unfortunately, what happened behind the closed doors of his private chambers still remained a mystery, but it\u2019s not as though he spent much time there according to his knights.</p><p><i>Let\u2019s hope there\u2019s something new this week.</i></p><p>\u201cReports?\u201d he asked, although admittingly, it came off as more of a command than a request. And did it sound a little harsh? It must have as both knights hesitated for the briefest of moments before Kasari broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cMaster, I beg your apologies, but there is nothing new to add to my report this week. In the shifts that I had followed the general, nothing seemed amiss. He comes and goes at the same time, following his schedule to a tee,\u201d she said, her voice muffled by her mask. Continuing to clarify her point she started, \u201cHe\u2019s met with a few new First Order staff, but it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary. They mostly discuss upcoming projects or updates as it concerns the Resistance, your excellency.\u201d </p><p>Before Kylo could ask another question, Jaster chimed in unexpectedly. </p><p>\u201cI will echo Kasari Ren\u2019s report, Master. I also have not noticed a break in General Hux\u2019s activities,\u201d he stated rather dryly. \u201cIt does not appear as though the general is plotting against the First Order, at least not publicly.\u201d</p><p>This was not what Kylo wanted to hear. It had been weeks since his knights had been assigned to follow Hux. He knew both of them were tiring from his order and he could feel their distaste for such a mundane activity, though he knew neither of them would openly say something. At a different time, before he assumed the mantle of Supreme Leader, Kasari Ren might have been more candid. They did have more of a casual relationship growing up.</p><p>Outside of the hard facts provided in their report, Kylo also wanted to know their thoughts. Did they have reason to believe Hux was up to something behind closed doors in his quarters? Surely after noting his every move for weeks, they would have a hunch. With that thought, he moved to ask, \u201cDo either of you have reason to believe that he\u2019s plotting something behind closed doors? Do you think there\u2019s value in bugging his personal chambers?\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Kasari was quick to share her opinion, \u201cI think it could certainly help. That\u2019s the only place on the ship where we can\u2019t watch him.\u201d She paused a moment releasing a tired sigh before continuing. \u201cWhat is it you want us to look for exactly? Is there another reason why you want us to follow him?\u201d </p><p>Of course Kasari would push back. She would often question Luke\u2019s instructions at the Jedi Temple, not to purposefully challenge his authority, but to better understand the reasons why things were done. Kasari, empathetic to her core, wanted to visualize what brought the Jedi of old to adopt their rules. Today, Kylo could sense Kasari\u2019s intent. She wanted to understand why Kylo, Master of the Knights of Ren and leader of the First Order, would have such a fixation on Hux. She wanted to help him. Some things never seemed to changed.</p><p>However much Kylo wanted to share the burden of his worries - a potential coup, more assassination attempts, secret missions - with his knights, he decided against it. This was something that he wanted to keep to himself. Plus, these would only lead to more questions that would become too dangerous to answer. Where would he even begin to explain the treacherous acts he\u2019s committed, all because of his fascination with the Lightsided scavenger? Murdering their master Snoke? Ruining Hux\u2019s plans to bring Rey to justice? No. He would not be giving any more details than what was necessary. </p><p>\u201cThe details as to why I want you to watch Hux are irrelevant,\u201d he stated sharply. He hoped this came off like a warning to let the subject go. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that Hux and I have not seen eye-to-eye on a number of different initiatives. For now, he\u2019s compliant and goes along without much resistance. I want to ensure it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>He left the weight of his words hang in the air for a brief moment, allowing the silence to fill the room. Kasari and Jaster Ren would have to live with the fact that this was all the information they would be receiving from Kylo at the moment. </p><p>When the silence continued to grow, Kasari dropped her head back down. Was this a show of submission or frustration? Kylo couldn\u2019t tell. He reached out and pressed his mind against Kasari\u2019s hoping to find the thoughts that remained unspoken. She immediately became aware of his presence and, knowing full well why he was attempting to read her mind, threw her mental shields up preventing him from diving any further. </p><p>To Snoke, her clear unwillingness to share her thoughts would have been seen as insubordination. Kasari would have been shot straight through with lightning for such a display of disrespect, but Kylo was not Snoke. He wasn\u2019t going to use the same cruel tactics on his knights, and so decided against probing further. If she wanted to say something, she should feel comfortable to do so in her own time. Besides, he wanted to return to his meditation, and his knights should really return to their posts.</p><p>Kylo was growing tired of a lack of information about Hux. It was time to push things along. If you wanted to get something done, sometimes the best thing to do was to do it yourself. Luckily for Kylo, he had the protection of his knights to back him up.</p><p>If it was true that the only time his knights couldn\u2019t oversee Hux was when he was in his personal quarters, then maybe Kylo ought to see what Hux has been up to when not under the watchful eyes of his knights. As the Supreme Leader, Kylo\u2019s personal keycode granted him full access to any and all locations on the ship, and that included the personal quarters of all the ship\u2019s personnel, no matter the rank. Depending on the time, Kylo could probably slip in and out unnoticed.</p><p>Actually, now that he was thinking about it, Hux was supposed to be in a meeting for a few hours today with the military officers - his command. Kylo quickly glanced at the chrono mounted in the paneling. Yep. He\u2019ll still be away for another two hours at the minimum. These meetings usually go longer than expected. This just may be the break Kylo needed.</p><p>With that, his mind was decided. He would just go through Hux\u2019s quarters himself and get to the bottom of this. Maybe if he found nothing, it would finally put his mind at ease.</p><p>\u201cJaster Ren, you will resume watch over Hux for the remainder of the week, beginning the minute you are dismissed,\u201d Kylo said shortly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should know, he is in a meeting right now. If the meeting is cut short for any reason, you are to alert Kasari via your comlink. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKasari and I will be pushing this along. We\u2019re going to bug his quarters, but first we need to see if he has anything to hide.\u201d </p><p>At this, he turned to both Jaster and Kasari.</p><p>\u201cJaster, Kasari,\u201d he said, his voice low, conveying the seriousness of what he was about to say.</p><p>\u201cYes Master?\u201d they questioned.</p><p>\u201cYou will speak of this to no one. We cannot have General Hux catch on to what we are about to do. Am I making myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d Kasari and Jaster answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaster, you may take your leave.\u201d</p><p>Jaster rose at his command and strode across Kylo\u2019s chambers, pausing only to allow the entrance to open with a swoosh as he swiftly made his way out.</p><p>Kylo moved to stand by Kasari who was still kneeling before him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We won\u2019t have much time before Hux returns,\u201d he said, casting his eyes down upon her.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have far to go before arriving at Hux\u2019s private quarters as the highest, most elite officials and staff shared the same floor as the Supreme Leader. Kylo ordered Kasari to stand watch and alert him if any suspicious activity arose via their comlink. She was hesitant at first, prefering to go with him should he need assistance in his search, but Kylo reassured her that her standing watch was needed more.</p><p>He punched in his keycode on the datapad just outside the door. A small red light flashed, announcing that he\u2019d been cleared. As the door slid open, he stepped inside.</p><p>Kylo took a moment to consider Hux\u2019s chambers. The floors were the same shiny black material found throughout the <i>Finalizer.</i> Like all other cabins on the ship, it was designed to be distinctly utilitarian, but unlike Kylo\u2019s chambers which had very little personal possessions (save for his private collection of Jedi and Sith artifacts), Hux\u2019s quarters was filled with trinkets neatly displayed or tucked away in their respective places.</p><p>The charcoal walls were adorned with certifications from some of the best primary schools and universities the Core worlds could offer. One wall in particular was covered in various medals: some from his time at the university and others obtained from his achievements in the First Order. Hux was nothing if not ambitious. Kylo could acknowledge that.</p><p>He crossed the room and began browsing through the small collection of books nested on a shelf above Hux\u2019s desk, which held many works centered around military strategy during the days of the Rebellion. Another book highlighted prominent military leaders throughout the ages on both sides of the war. Then there was another one with a small tuft of paper sticking up through the pages like a flag. Thinking that it might offer up some useful insight, Kylo reached for the book and thumbed through the pages until he reached the one Hux had marked. </p><p>At the top of the page, there was a portrait of an officer wearing a First Order uniform with an impressive decoration of medals and pins adorning his left breast panel indicating his rank as a senior-level officer. Looking at his face, his hard eyes were an icy, pale blue that appeared to stare right through you. He looked like a man who didn\u2019t give a damn about anyone who stood in his way. Ruthless was likely a more accurate description. But perhaps the most striking feature he possessed was a crown of bright red hair.</p><p>This was Hux\u2019s father.</p><p>Sure enough, the name included under the photo confirmed his suspicions. While Kylo didn\u2019t know much about the late Commandant Brendol Hux, he had heard stories about his harsh command. This was not a man you wanted to cross, unless of course you had a death wish. </p><p>Not wanting to waste any more time, Kylo shut the book and returned it back to its usual place on the shelf.</p><p>Nothing else around his desk was out of place. Everything was neat and tidy, so Kylo chose to move toward his wardrobe after running his hand along the underside of the desk to check for hidden drawers. Finding none, he moved on.</p><p>Unlike his own wardrobe, which mostly contained items in the darkest of blacks, Hux actually had some shades of gray and red mixed in amongst the otherwise neutral color scheme of the First Order uniforms. Oddly enough, there was one very red cape tucked away in the back of the closet behind the coats and jackets. This would surely make his red headed foe stick out like a sore thumb, Kylo thought.</p><p>Moving on after digging in between and behind the racks of hanging clothes, Kylo began opening all the drawers. One drawer that neatly held a set of belts with highly polished buckles contained a severely weathered book, its pages frayed at the edges. </p><p>Upon first glance, Kylo estimated this book to be 1,000 years old or more. The simple cover itself reminded him of the sacred Jedi texts Luke kept in his private room at the temple, the same ones that were now in Rey\u2019s possession, minus a few pages that Kylo pulled for himself. Those were safely locked away on Mustafar in Darth Vader\u2019s castle. Snoke had been in possession of the castle for years, but since Kylo had become his apprentice, Snoke had released any hold over it, claiming that it was Kylo\u2019s birthright to have it. In that castle, Kylo only kept a handful of his most prized possessions, including a few Jedi and Sith holocrons.</p><p>Carefully, he lifted the book out of the drawer and crossed the room to take a seat at Hux\u2019s desk to have better light to examine the book.</p><p>Kylo gingerly cracked open the cover revealing pages of text written in a language long forgotten by most in the galaxy, but not to Kylo. He was perhaps one of the few people left who could interpret its secrets for it was the same language found in one of the books Kylo had read while studying the many applications of the Force. The book before him, however, and the one he interpreted were vastly different. For starters, the book at Luke\u2019s temple contained explanations in theory of what could be accomplished with the Force - Jedi mind tricks, healing, etc. - this one it seemed carried the knowledge of the Sith and the realities of how they used the Force, particularly in times of war.</p><p><i>This must be from the Jedi-Sith war which began in 1032 B.B.Y.</i>, he thought. <i>Wow</i>. He believed all the holocrons and texts were lost at this time from both the Jedi and the Sith. It was rare to find any recording written or spoken from the Sith since tradition dictated that knowledge be passed down verbally from master to apprentice. The Sith guarded their secrets well.</p><p>But the discovery of this book begged the question: how in the name of the Force did Hux find one of these texts? Maybe the more important question was: why would Hux keep it? It was no secret that Hux was afraid of the Force. All Kylo had to do was shoot his arm out and pretend like he was about to Force choke him to make the man jump out of his skin. Truly, Hux hated the Force. Which brought Kylo back to his question: why would Hux keep a Sith text?</p><p>Curiosity and, if Kylo was being honest, excitement flooded through him at the idea of reading a Sith text. He\u2019d always loved to read, especially when he was younger and had more time to do so.

No one quite knew how to respond to his more relaxed, uplifted attitude. It was well-known within the First Order that Kylo Ren was as serious as they come, with a raging temper to match when provoked. He was not a man to be trifled with, but even more so, he was not a man known for being happy. Ever. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Sometimes he was met with suspicion, especially when it came to General Hux. Being the type of man who ascended to his coveted position through less than favorable methods, Armitage assumed there were secret operations that he wasn\u2019t privy to, and that made him nervous. While it was not as Hux feared, Kylo couldn\u2019t help exploiting his suspicions for the time being. Armitage shared more detailed information in his reports than he had previously, clearly trying to demonstrate everything he has accomplished on behalf of the First Order. The additional insight was particularly helpful as it gave away more details about Hux\u2019s comings and goings which, in turn, Kylo passed along to his knights while they continued to monitor him.</p><p>Secretly, the only two people in the galaxy who knew the source of his new attitude were himself and Rey.</p><p>While he had waited with Rey as she recovered from the attack by the bounty hunters, Kylo had witnessed something that truly moved him at his core. While caught between an open Force bond and an interruption from that Resistance scum, Rey had done more for Kylo\u2019s ego in a brief second than anyone had in years. When she withdrew her hand from the golden boy of the Resistance, Dameron knew it for what it was - rejection. Little did he know that resting in Rey\u2019s other hand was Kylo\u2019s, one that she had intentionally reached for and encouraged to stay. She had chosen him. Once again, like she had when she arrived on the Supremacy, Rey had chosen him and that meant more to Kylo than he cared to admit. Throughout his life, no one had shown as much support as Rey had in those two moments. Yes, Snoke had been supportive of him, encouraging his studies of the Darkside, but there was always a hidden agenda. With Rey, there were no strings attached.</p><p>Despite Snoke connecting them through the Force, the bond had remained open. It was the Force at work. Kylo knew it. The Force wants balance restored to the galaxy. Maybe, just maybe, he was moving one step closer to accomplishing it. Rey\u2019s request for him to stay by her side fueled his belief that she would join him. Could it be that the vision he saw when they touched hands would come to pass? Kylo certainly hoped so. </p><p>She was his equal in the Force, her light being the perfect counterbalance to his darkness. If she would allow it, Kylo would still jump at the opportunity to provide her with proper training in the Force. He would show her all the power that the Darkside could offer and while he didn\u2019t agree with the strict and stunted dogma of the Jedi teachings, there was still plenty to gain from their practice. Kylo would take the best teachings from both the Jedi and the Sith to begin a new era of Force users. Some students would foster more light than darkness or vice versa, and that would be okay. Never again would a Force-user be trained to shun part of who they were.</p><p>The thought of this new order and the potential for future Force-sensitives only propelled his unusually good mood leading him to think more about Rey. He wondered what she would think of his plan to balance the galaxy. Would she like it? Would she want to be a part of it? </p><p>Truth be told, he had no idea. </p><p>During the brief moments when their bond had opened, neither of them would discuss their personal aspirations, choosing instead to stick with safer conversation topics. After what happened almost a year ago, it was clear that neither of them was as trusting of one another as they once were. That same trust would take time to build. Kylo hoped that it would happen sooner rather than later, which brought his thought back to the task at hand: forcing their bond to open at will.</p><p>Kylo had been meditating on the Force in his quarters while using Vader\u2019s mask as an aid to channel his power. He always found that it was easier to concentrate in the presence of his grandfather\u2019s mask, as if Anakin Skywalker himself was guiding him.</p><p>Sometimes he would plea to his grandfather\u2019s spirit to show him the ways of the Force, and today was no different. Kylo had been attempting to open the bond for a little over an hour, only to hit an impenetrable wall every time he found Rey\u2019s presence in the Force. Her signature shown in the Force with an intensity that rivaled the brightest star in the galaxy. Time and time again, when he felt just a little closer to opening the bond, his concentration would crumble, the effort often drawing his strength away.</p><p>But despite his failed attempts, he kept trying. Since it reopened, he could feel it getting stronger and stronger every time they were connected. They could now see each other\u2019s surroundings, a feat they were unable to do previously. It also seemed as though their emotions could bleed through the bond at unexpected times. He will never forget the fear that pierced his heart when she called his name across the stars moments before she was captured.</p><p>It was these revelations that kept him going, that persuaded him to keep trying.</p><p>Once again, he focused on his breathing. The feeling of life-giving oxygen passing in and out of his lungs felt like a life-line that helped center his thoughts. If there was anything the Jedi got right, it was their insistence that proper breathing techniques enhanced the meditating experience. </p><p>When he finally felt as though his mind had been cleared and tranquility hung around him, he opened himself up to the living Force, pleading with it to show him the key to opening the bond he shared with Rey.</p><p><i>Breathe in and out</i>, he thought exhaling slowly.</p><p>Slowly, the darkness that surrounded him began to reveal a faint glow, and from what his heightened senses told him, it was light years away. </p><p>When he was sure this was what he was looking for, Kylo refocused his efforts so that all of his thoughts were directed at this small glowing presence in the Force, encouraging it to blossom. Warmth spread through his body, beginning at the crown of his head and moving down to his toes. The feeling reminded him of the warm summers he spent by the lakes on Chandrila - welcoming and at the same time thrilling. </p><p>Soon enough, what was once a faint glow in the darkness was now a light that shown with the intensity of the Chandrila sun. The fervor of it all made his skin crawl with excitement. It made him feel alive.</p><p>\u201cRey,\u201d he breathed. The light she carried within her was so strong. She was the galaxy\u2019s counter to the darkness he possessed.</p><p>After pausing a few moments to admire the strength of her Force signature, he went right to work summoning his energy, and began slowly pressing it against hers. </p><p>\u201cOpen,\u201d he said in an almost inaudible whisper.</p><p>Upon his command, he sensed that the walls which separated them began to dissolve, but like the intensity of the light, they too were also strong. All of Kylo\u2019s efforts were aimed at one thing and one thing only, slowly chipping away at the Force\u2019s barrier. But just as soon as he began the task at hand, his exhaustion overtook his concentration and he awoke to find himself sitting before his grandfather\u2019s mask, cold and alone once more.</p><p>He let out a growl of frustration. He had been so close this time. He could feel it. </p><p>Unable to control his emotions, he reached for the nearest object he could find - his data pad - \u00a0and hurled into the wall, showering the room with glass and metal pieces. He stood there savagely drawing in one ragged breath after another as the blood in his veins continued to boil. </p><p><i>Why can\u2019t I get it to open?,</i> he thought. <i>I am the most powerful Darkside user in the entire galaxy, the scion to the mighty Skywalker line, trained in both the light and the dark. </i></p><p>Just as he reached for another object, an unexpected knock came from the door to his chambers.</p><p>In his rage, he had almost forgotten that he summoned his knights to report on Hux\u2019s comings and goings. </p><p><i>Kriff</i>, he thought.</p><p>He collected himself for a brief moment before permitting his knights to enter his personal chambers. He did not want them to witness his weakness. A man who cannot control his emotions is not fit to lead the First Order. If they saw him in a state of weakness, surely his knights too would doubt his ability to command the Knights of Ren.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Kylo used the Force to slide the door open. \u201cYou may enter,\u201d he said, trying his best to keep his voice level. </p><p>Jaster and Kasari Ren stepped over the threshold, the lightsabers at their hips clinking against their armour. They proceeded until they were within a few paces from where Kylo stood. Both of them slowly dropped to their knees and bowed their heads in a display of respect for the Master of the Knights of Ren. </p><p>Kylo had been itching to hear this week\u2019s report from his knights. Ever since he ordered Jaster and Kasari to shadow Hux, their findings had been less than he had hoped. From what they could tell, Hux maintained a normal schedule, free from unusual diversions. If it did change, it was for a trivial endeavor, such as a follow-up meeting with an officer or a casual trip to fill an extra cup of caf while he worked. Unfortunately, what happened behind the closed doors of his private chambers still remained a mystery, but it\u2019s not as though he spent much time there according to his knights.</p><p><i>Let\u2019s hope there\u2019s something new this week.</i></p><p>\u201cReports?\u201d he asked, although admittingly, it came off as more of a command than a request. And did it sound a little harsh? It must have as both knights hesitated for the briefest of moments before Kasari broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cMaster, I beg your apologies, but there is nothing new to add to my report this week. In the shifts that I had followed the general, nothing seemed amiss. He comes and goes at the same time, following his schedule to a tee,\u201d she said, her voice muffled by her mask. Continuing to clarify her point she started, \u201cHe\u2019s met with a few new First Order staff, but it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary. They mostly discuss upcoming projects or updates as it concerns the Resistance, your excellency.\u201d </p><p>Before Kylo could ask another question, Jaster chimed in unexpectedly. </p><p>\u201cI will echo Kasari Ren\u2019s report, Master. I also have not noticed a break in General Hux\u2019s activities,\u201d he stated rather dryly. \u201cIt does not appear as though the general is plotting against the First Order, at least not publicly.\u201d</p><p>This was not what Kylo wanted to hear. It had been weeks since his knights had been assigned to follow Hux. He knew both of them were tiring from his order and he could feel their distaste for such a mundane activity, though he knew neither of them would openly say something. At a different time, before he assumed the mantle of Supreme Leader, Kasari Ren might have been more candid. They did have more of a casual relationship growing up.</p><p>Outside of the hard facts provided in their report, Kylo also wanted to know their thoughts. Did they have reason to believe Hux was up to something behind closed doors in his quarters? Surely after noting his every move for weeks, they would have a hunch. With that thought, he moved to ask, \u201cDo either of you have reason to believe that he\u2019s plotting something behind closed doors? Do you think there\u2019s value in bugging his personal chambers?\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Kasari was quick to share her opinion, \u201cI think it could certainly help. That\u2019s the only place on the ship where we can\u2019t watch him.\u201d She paused a moment releasing a tired sigh before continuing. \u201cWhat is it you want us to look for exactly? Is there another reason why you want us to follow him?\u201d </p><p>Of course Kasari would push back. She would often question Luke\u2019s instructions at the Jedi Temple, not to purposefully challenge his authority, but to better understand the reasons why things were done. Kasari, empathetic to her core, wanted to visualize what brought the Jedi of old to adopt their rules. Today, Kylo could sense Kasari\u2019s intent. She wanted to understand why Kylo, Master of the Knights of Ren and leader of the First Order, would have such a fixation on Hux. She wanted to help him. Some things never seemed to changed.</p><p>However much Kylo wanted to share the burden of his worries - a potential coup, more assassination attempts, secret missions - with his knights, he decided against it. This was something that he wanted to keep to himself. Plus, these would only lead to more questions that would become too dangerous to answer. Where would he even begin to explain the treacherous acts he\u2019s committed, all because of his fascination with the Lightsided scavenger? Murdering their master Snoke? Ruining Hux\u2019s plans to bring Rey to justice? No. He would not be giving any more details than what was necessary. </p><p>\u201cThe details as to why I want you to watch Hux are irrelevant,\u201d he stated sharply. He hoped this came off like a warning to let the subject go. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that Hux and I have not seen eye-to-eye on a number of different initiatives. For now, he\u2019s compliant and goes along without much resistance. I want to ensure it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>He left the weight of his words hang in the air for a brief moment, allowing the silence to fill the room. Kasari and Jaster Ren would have to live with the fact that this was all the information they would be receiving from Kylo at the moment. </p><p>When the silence continued to grow, Kasari dropped her head back down. Was this a show of submission or frustration? Kylo couldn\u2019t tell. He reached out and pressed his mind against Kasari\u2019s hoping to find the thoughts that remained unspoken. She immediately became aware of his presence and, knowing full well why he was attempting to read her mind, threw her mental shields up preventing him from diving any further. </p><p>To Snoke, her clear unwillingness to share her thoughts would have been seen as insubordination. Kasari would have been shot straight through with lightning for such a display of disrespect, but Kylo was not Snoke. He wasn\u2019t going to use the same cruel tactics on his knights, and so decided against probing further. If she wanted to say something, she should feel comfortable to do so in her own time. Besides, he wanted to return to his meditation, and his knights should really return to their posts.</p><p>Kylo was growing tired of a lack of information about Hux. It was time to push things along. If you wanted to get something done, sometimes the best thing to do was to do it yourself. Luckily for Kylo, he had the protection of his knights to back him up.</p><p>If it was true that the only time his knights couldn\u2019t oversee Hux was when he was in his personal quarters, then maybe Kylo ought to see what Hux has been up to when not under the watchful eyes of his knights. As the Supreme Leader, Kylo\u2019s personal keycode granted him full access to any and all locations on the ship, and that included the personal quarters of all the ship\u2019s personnel, no matter the rank. Depending on the time, Kylo could probably slip in and out unnoticed.</p><p>Actually, now that he was thinking about it, Hux was supposed to be in a meeting for a few hours today with the military officers - his command. Kylo quickly glanced at the chrono mounted in the paneling. Yep. He\u2019ll still be away for another two hours at the minimum. These meetings usually go longer than expected. This just may be the break Kylo needed.</p><p>With that, his mind was decided. He would just go through Hux\u2019s quarters himself and get to the bottom of this. Maybe if he found nothing, it would finally put his mind at ease.</p><p>\u201cJaster Ren, you will resume watch over Hux for the remainder of the week, beginning the minute you are dismissed,\u201d Kylo said shortly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should know, he is in a meeting right now. If the meeting is cut short for any reason, you are to alert Kasari via your comlink. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKasari and I will be pushing this along. We\u2019re going to bug his quarters, but first we need to see if he has anything to hide.\u201d </p><p>At this, he turned to both Jaster and Kasari.</p><p>\u201cJaster, Kasari,\u201d he said, his voice low, conveying the seriousness of what he was about to say.</p><p>\u201cYes Master?\u201d they questioned.</p><p>\u201cYou will speak of this to no one. We cannot have General Hux catch on to what we are about to do. Am I making myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d Kasari and Jaster answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaster, you may take your leave.\u201d</p><p>Jaster rose at his command and strode across Kylo\u2019s chambers, pausing only to allow the entrance to open with a swoosh as he swiftly made his way out.</p><p>Kylo moved to stand by Kasari who was still kneeling before him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We won\u2019t have much time before Hux returns,\u201d he said, casting his eyes down upon her.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have far to go before arriving at Hux\u2019s private quarters as the highest, most elite officials and staff shared the same floor as the Supreme Leader. Kylo ordered Kasari to stand watch and alert him if any suspicious activity arose via their comlink. She was hesitant at first, prefering to go with him should he need assistance in his search, but Kylo reassured her that her standing watch was needed more.</p><p>He punched in his keycode on the datapad just outside the door. A small red light flashed, announcing that he\u2019d been cleared. As the door slid open, he stepped inside.</p><p>Kylo took a moment to consider Hux\u2019s chambers. The floors were the same shiny black material found throughout the <i>Finalizer.</i> Like all other cabins on the ship, it was designed to be distinctly utilitarian, but unlike Kylo\u2019s chambers which had very little personal possessions (save for his private collection of Jedi and Sith artifacts), Hux\u2019s quarters was filled with trinkets neatly displayed or tucked away in their respective places.</p><p>The charcoal walls were adorned with certifications from some of the best primary schools and universities the Core worlds could offer. One wall in particular was covered in various medals: some from his time at the university and others obtained from his achievements in the First Order. Hux was nothing if not ambitious. Kylo could acknowledge that.</p><p>He crossed the room and began browsing through the small collection of books nested on a shelf above Hux\u2019s desk, which held many works centered around military strategy during the days of the Rebellion. Another book highlighted prominent military leaders throughout the ages on both sides of the war. Then there was another one with a small tuft of paper sticking up through the pages like a flag. Thinking that it might offer up some useful insight, Kylo reached for the book and thumbed through the pages until he reached the one Hux had marked. </p><p>At the top of the page, there was a portrait of an officer wearing a First Order uniform with an impressive decoration of medals and pins adorning his left breast panel indicating his rank as a senior-level officer. Looking at his face, his hard eyes were an icy, pale blue that appeared to stare right through you. He looked like a man who didn\u2019t give a damn about anyone who stood in his way. Ruthless was likely a more accurate description. But perhaps the most striking feature he possessed was a crown of bright red hair.</p><p>This was Hux\u2019s father.</p><p>Sure enough, the name included under the photo confirmed his suspicions. While Kylo didn\u2019t know much about the late Commandant Brendol Hux, he had heard stories about his harsh command. This was not a man you wanted to cross, unless of course you had a death wish. </p><p>Not wanting to waste any more time, Kylo shut the book and returned it back to its usual place on the shelf.</p><p>Nothing else around his desk was out of place. Everything was neat and tidy, so Kylo chose to move toward his wardrobe after running his hand along the underside of the desk to check for hidden drawers. Finding none, he moved on.</p><p>Unlike his own wardrobe, which mostly contained items in the darkest of blacks, Hux actually had some shades of gray and red mixed in amongst the otherwise neutral color scheme of the First Order uniforms. Oddly enough, there was one very red cape tucked away in the back of the closet behind the coats and jackets. This would surely make his red headed foe stick out like a sore thumb, Kylo thought.</p><p>Moving on after digging in between and behind the racks of hanging clothes, Kylo began opening all the drawers. One drawer that neatly held a set of belts with highly polished buckles contained a severely weathered book, its pages frayed at the edges. </p><p>Upon first glance, Kylo estimated this book to be 1,000 years old or more. The simple cover itself reminded him of the sacred Jedi texts Luke kept in his private room at the temple, the same ones that were now in Rey\u2019s possession, minus a few pages that Kylo pulled for himself. Those were safely locked away on Mustafar in Darth Vader\u2019s castle. Snoke had been in possession of the castle for years, but since Kylo had become his apprentice, Snoke had released any hold over it, claiming that it was Kylo\u2019s birthright to have it. In that castle, Kylo only kept a handful of his most prized possessions, including a few Jedi and Sith holocrons.</p><p>Carefully, he lifted the book out of the drawer and crossed the room to take a seat at Hux\u2019s desk to have better light to examine the book.</p><p>Kylo gingerly cracked open the cover revealing pages of text written in a language long forgotten by most in the galaxy, but not to Kylo. He was perhaps one of the few people left who could interpret its secrets for it was the same language found in one of the books Kylo had read while studying the many applications of the Force. The book before him, however, and the one he interpreted were vastly different. For starters, the book at Luke\u2019s temple contained explanations in theory of what could be accomplished with the Force - Jedi mind tricks, healing, etc. - this one it seemed carried the knowledge of the Sith and the realities of how they used the Force, particularly in times of war.</p><p><i>This must be from the Jedi-Sith war which began in 1032 B.B.Y.</i>, he thought. <i>Wow</i>. He believed all the holocrons and texts were lost at this time from both the Jedi and the Sith. It was rare to find any recording written or spoken from the Sith since tradition dictated that knowledge be passed down verbally from master to apprentice. The Sith guarded their secrets well.</p><p>But the discovery of this book begged the question: how in the name of the Force did Hux find one of these texts? Maybe the more important question was: why would Hux keep it? It was no secret that Hux was afraid of the Force. All Kylo had to do was shoot his arm out and pretend like he was about to Force choke him to make the man jump out of his skin. Truly, Hux hated the Force. Which brought Kylo back to his question: why would Hux keep a Sith text?</p><p>Curiosity and, if Kylo was being honest, excitement flooded through him at the idea of reading a Sith text. He\u2019d always loved to read, especially when he was younger and had more time to do so. His favorite areas of study were Sith and Jedi lore, along with the political history of the galaxy and, naturally, the rise and fall of his grandfather, Darth Vader. He particularly liked learning about his life as a Jedi before the fall of the Republic.</p><p>As he began thumbing through the pages, he noticed that some boasted highly detailed illustrations of Force techniques. One illustration in particular begged Kylo to stop his casual reading.</p><p>At first glance, the drawing of two heads facing opposite directions with a paler wavelength shared between them caught his breath. It appeared as though he discovered the mystery behind how Force bonds work, but what he stumbled upon instead was a description of a Sith technique they called \u201ctransfer essence.\u201d</p><p>According to the text before him, transfer essence or transfer life as some called it, was a more radical dark side power used by Sith Lords to cheat death again and again.

No one quite knew how to respond to his more relaxed, uplifted attitude. It was well-known within the First Order that Kylo Ren was as serious as they come, with a raging temper to match when provoked. He was not a man to be trifled with, but even more so, he was not a man known for being happy. Ever. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Sometimes he was met with suspicion, especially when it came to General Hux. Being the type of man who ascended to his coveted position through less than favorable methods, Armitage assumed there were secret operations that he wasn\u2019t privy to, and that made him nervous. While it was not as Hux feared, Kylo couldn\u2019t help exploiting his suspicions for the time being. Armitage shared more detailed information in his reports than he had previously, clearly trying to demonstrate everything he has accomplished on behalf of the First Order. The additional insight was particularly helpful as it gave away more details about Hux\u2019s comings and goings which, in turn, Kylo passed along to his knights while they continued to monitor him.</p><p>Secretly, the only two people in the galaxy who knew the source of his new attitude were himself and Rey.</p><p>While he had waited with Rey as she recovered from the attack by the bounty hunters, Kylo had witnessed something that truly moved him at his core. While caught between an open Force bond and an interruption from that Resistance scum, Rey had done more for Kylo\u2019s ego in a brief second than anyone had in years. When she withdrew her hand from the golden boy of the Resistance, Dameron knew it for what it was - rejection. Little did he know that resting in Rey\u2019s other hand was Kylo\u2019s, one that she had intentionally reached for and encouraged to stay. She had chosen him. Once again, like she had when she arrived on the Supremacy, Rey had chosen him and that meant more to Kylo than he cared to admit. Throughout his life, no one had shown as much support as Rey had in those two moments. Yes, Snoke had been supportive of him, encouraging his studies of the Darkside, but there was always a hidden agenda. With Rey, there were no strings attached.</p><p>Despite Snoke connecting them through the Force, the bond had remained open. It was the Force at work. Kylo knew it. The Force wants balance restored to the galaxy. Maybe, just maybe, he was moving one step closer to accomplishing it. Rey\u2019s request for him to stay by her side fueled his belief that she would join him. Could it be that the vision he saw when they touched hands would come to pass? Kylo certainly hoped so. </p><p>She was his equal in the Force, her light being the perfect counterbalance to his darkness. If she would allow it, Kylo would still jump at the opportunity to provide her with proper training in the Force. He would show her all the power that the Darkside could offer and while he didn\u2019t agree with the strict and stunted dogma of the Jedi teachings, there was still plenty to gain from their practice. Kylo would take the best teachings from both the Jedi and the Sith to begin a new era of Force users. Some students would foster more light than darkness or vice versa, and that would be okay. Never again would a Force-user be trained to shun part of who they were.</p><p>The thought of this new order and the potential for future Force-sensitives only propelled his unusually good mood leading him to think more about Rey. He wondered what she would think of his plan to balance the galaxy. Would she like it? Would she want to be a part of it? </p><p>Truth be told, he had no idea. </p><p>During the brief moments when their bond had opened, neither of them would discuss their personal aspirations, choosing instead to stick with safer conversation topics. After what happened almost a year ago, it was clear that neither of them was as trusting of one another as they once were. That same trust would take time to build. Kylo hoped that it would happen sooner rather than later, which brought his thought back to the task at hand: forcing their bond to open at will.</p><p>Kylo had been meditating on the Force in his quarters while using Vader\u2019s mask as an aid to channel his power. He always found that it was easier to concentrate in the presence of his grandfather\u2019s mask, as if Anakin Skywalker himself was guiding him.</p><p>Sometimes he would plea to his grandfather\u2019s spirit to show him the ways of the Force, and today was no different. Kylo had been attempting to open the bond for a little over an hour, only to hit an impenetrable wall every time he found Rey\u2019s presence in the Force. Her signature shown in the Force with an intensity that rivaled the brightest star in the galaxy. Time and time again, when he felt just a little closer to opening the bond, his concentration would crumble, the effort often drawing his strength away.</p><p>But despite his failed attempts, he kept trying. Since it reopened, he could feel it getting stronger and stronger every time they were connected. They could now see each other\u2019s surroundings, a feat they were unable to do previously. It also seemed as though their emotions could bleed through the bond at unexpected times. He will never forget the fear that pierced his heart when she called his name across the stars moments before she was captured.</p><p>It was these revelations that kept him going, that persuaded him to keep trying.</p><p>Once again, he focused on his breathing. The feeling of life-giving oxygen passing in and out of his lungs felt like a life-line that helped center his thoughts. If there was anything the Jedi got right, it was their insistence that proper breathing techniques enhanced the meditating experience. </p><p>When he finally felt as though his mind had been cleared and tranquility hung around him, he opened himself up to the living Force, pleading with it to show him the key to opening the bond he shared with Rey.</p><p><i>Breathe in and out</i>, he thought exhaling slowly.</p><p>Slowly, the darkness that surrounded him began to reveal a faint glow, and from what his heightened senses told him, it was light years away. </p><p>When he was sure this was what he was looking for, Kylo refocused his efforts so that all of his thoughts were directed at this small glowing presence in the Force, encouraging it to blossom. Warmth spread through his body, beginning at the crown of his head and moving down to his toes. The feeling reminded him of the warm summers he spent by the lakes on Chandrila - welcoming and at the same time thrilling. </p><p>Soon enough, what was once a faint glow in the darkness was now a light that shown with the intensity of the Chandrila sun. The fervor of it all made his skin crawl with excitement. It made him feel alive.</p><p>\u201cRey,\u201d he breathed. The light she carried within her was so strong. She was the galaxy\u2019s counter to the darkness he possessed.</p><p>After pausing a few moments to admire the strength of her Force signature, he went right to work summoning his energy, and began slowly pressing it against hers. </p><p>\u201cOpen,\u201d he said in an almost inaudible whisper.</p><p>Upon his command, he sensed that the walls which separated them began to dissolve, but like the intensity of the light, they too were also strong. All of Kylo\u2019s efforts were aimed at one thing and one thing only, slowly chipping away at the Force\u2019s barrier. But just as soon as he began the task at hand, his exhaustion overtook his concentration and he awoke to find himself sitting before his grandfather\u2019s mask, cold and alone once more.</p><p>He let out a growl of frustration. He had been so close this time. He could feel it. </p><p>Unable to control his emotions, he reached for the nearest object he could find - his data pad - \u00a0and hurled into the wall, showering the room with glass and metal pieces. He stood there savagely drawing in one ragged breath after another as the blood in his veins continued to boil. </p><p><i>Why can\u2019t I get it to open?,</i> he thought. <i>I am the most powerful Darkside user in the entire galaxy, the scion to the mighty Skywalker line, trained in both the light and the dark. </i></p><p>Just as he reached for another object, an unexpected knock came from the door to his chambers.</p><p>In his rage, he had almost forgotten that he summoned his knights to report on Hux\u2019s comings and goings. </p><p><i>Kriff</i>, he thought.</p><p>He collected himself for a brief moment before permitting his knights to enter his personal chambers. He did not want them to witness his weakness. A man who cannot control his emotions is not fit to lead the First Order. If they saw him in a state of weakness, surely his knights too would doubt his ability to command the Knights of Ren.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Kylo used the Force to slide the door open. \u201cYou may enter,\u201d he said, trying his best to keep his voice level. </p><p>Jaster and Kasari Ren stepped over the threshold, the lightsabers at their hips clinking against their armour. They proceeded until they were within a few paces from where Kylo stood. Both of them slowly dropped to their knees and bowed their heads in a display of respect for the Master of the Knights of Ren. </p><p>Kylo had been itching to hear this week\u2019s report from his knights. Ever since he ordered Jaster and Kasari to shadow Hux, their findings had been less than he had hoped. From what they could tell, Hux maintained a normal schedule, free from unusual diversions. If it did change, it was for a trivial endeavor, such as a follow-up meeting with an officer or a casual trip to fill an extra cup of caf while he worked. Unfortunately, what happened behind the closed doors of his private chambers still remained a mystery, but it\u2019s not as though he spent much time there according to his knights.</p><p><i>Let\u2019s hope there\u2019s something new this week.</i></p><p>\u201cReports?\u201d he asked, although admittingly, it came off as more of a command than a request. And did it sound a little harsh? It must have as both knights hesitated for the briefest of moments before Kasari broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cMaster, I beg your apologies, but there is nothing new to add to my report this week. In the shifts that I had followed the general, nothing seemed amiss. He comes and goes at the same time, following his schedule to a tee,\u201d she said, her voice muffled by her mask. Continuing to clarify her point she started, \u201cHe\u2019s met with a few new First Order staff, but it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary. They mostly discuss upcoming projects or updates as it concerns the Resistance, your excellency.\u201d </p><p>Before Kylo could ask another question, Jaster chimed in unexpectedly. </p><p>\u201cI will echo Kasari Ren\u2019s report, Master. I also have not noticed a break in General Hux\u2019s activities,\u201d he stated rather dryly. \u201cIt does not appear as though the general is plotting against the First Order, at least not publicly.\u201d</p><p>This was not what Kylo wanted to hear. It had been weeks since his knights had been assigned to follow Hux. He knew both of them were tiring from his order and he could feel their distaste for such a mundane activity, though he knew neither of them would openly say something. At a different time, before he assumed the mantle of Supreme Leader, Kasari Ren might have been more candid. They did have more of a casual relationship growing up.</p><p>Outside of the hard facts provided in their report, Kylo also wanted to know their thoughts. Did they have reason to believe Hux was up to something behind closed doors in his quarters? Surely after noting his every move for weeks, they would have a hunch. With that thought, he moved to ask, \u201cDo either of you have reason to believe that he\u2019s plotting something behind closed doors? Do you think there\u2019s value in bugging his personal chambers?\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Kasari was quick to share her opinion, \u201cI think it could certainly help. That\u2019s the only place on the ship where we can\u2019t watch him.\u201d She paused a moment releasing a tired sigh before continuing. \u201cWhat is it you want us to look for exactly? Is there another reason why you want us to follow him?\u201d </p><p>Of course Kasari would push back. She would often question Luke\u2019s instructions at the Jedi Temple, not to purposefully challenge his authority, but to better understand the reasons why things were done. Kasari, empathetic to her core, wanted to visualize what brought the Jedi of old to adopt their rules. Today, Kylo could sense Kasari\u2019s intent. She wanted to understand why Kylo, Master of the Knights of Ren and leader of the First Order, would have such a fixation on Hux. She wanted to help him. Some things never seemed to changed.</p><p>However much Kylo wanted to share the burden of his worries - a potential coup, more assassination attempts, secret missions - with his knights, he decided against it. This was something that he wanted to keep to himself. Plus, these would only lead to more questions that would become too dangerous to answer. Where would he even begin to explain the treacherous acts he\u2019s committed, all because of his fascination with the Lightsided scavenger? Murdering their master Snoke? Ruining Hux\u2019s plans to bring Rey to justice? No. He would not be giving any more details than what was necessary. </p><p>\u201cThe details as to why I want you to watch Hux are irrelevant,\u201d he stated sharply. He hoped this came off like a warning to let the subject go. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that Hux and I have not seen eye-to-eye on a number of different initiatives. For now, he\u2019s compliant and goes along without much resistance. I want to ensure it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>He left the weight of his words hang in the air for a brief moment, allowing the silence to fill the room. Kasari and Jaster Ren would have to live with the fact that this was all the information they would be receiving from Kylo at the moment. </p><p>When the silence continued to grow, Kasari dropped her head back down. Was this a show of submission or frustration? Kylo couldn\u2019t tell. He reached out and pressed his mind against Kasari\u2019s hoping to find the thoughts that remained unspoken. She immediately became aware of his presence and, knowing full well why he was attempting to read her mind, threw her mental shields up preventing him from diving any further. </p><p>To Snoke, her clear unwillingness to share her thoughts would have been seen as insubordination. Kasari would have been shot straight through with lightning for such a display of disrespect, but Kylo was not Snoke. He wasn\u2019t going to use the same cruel tactics on his knights, and so decided against probing further. If she wanted to say something, she should feel comfortable to do so in her own time. Besides, he wanted to return to his meditation, and his knights should really return to their posts.</p><p>Kylo was growing tired of a lack of information about Hux. It was time to push things along. If you wanted to get something done, sometimes the best thing to do was to do it yourself. Luckily for Kylo, he had the protection of his knights to back him up.</p><p>If it was true that the only time his knights couldn\u2019t oversee Hux was when he was in his personal quarters, then maybe Kylo ought to see what Hux has been up to when not under the watchful eyes of his knights. As the Supreme Leader, Kylo\u2019s personal keycode granted him full access to any and all locations on the ship, and that included the personal quarters of all the ship\u2019s personnel, no matter the rank. Depending on the time, Kylo could probably slip in and out unnoticed.</p><p>Actually, now that he was thinking about it, Hux was supposed to be in a meeting for a few hours today with the military officers - his command. Kylo quickly glanced at the chrono mounted in the paneling. Yep. He\u2019ll still be away for another two hours at the minimum. These meetings usually go longer than expected. This just may be the break Kylo needed.</p><p>With that, his mind was decided. He would just go through Hux\u2019s quarters himself and get to the bottom of this. Maybe if he found nothing, it would finally put his mind at ease.</p><p>\u201cJaster Ren, you will resume watch over Hux for the remainder of the week, beginning the minute you are dismissed,\u201d Kylo said shortly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should know, he is in a meeting right now. If the meeting is cut short for any reason, you are to alert Kasari via your comlink. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKasari and I will be pushing this along. We\u2019re going to bug his quarters, but first we need to see if he has anything to hide.\u201d </p><p>At this, he turned to both Jaster and Kasari.</p><p>\u201cJaster, Kasari,\u201d he said, his voice low, conveying the seriousness of what he was about to say.</p><p>\u201cYes Master?\u201d they questioned.</p><p>\u201cYou will speak of this to no one. We cannot have General Hux catch on to what we are about to do. Am I making myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d Kasari and Jaster answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaster, you may take your leave.\u201d</p><p>Jaster rose at his command and strode across Kylo\u2019s chambers, pausing only to allow the entrance to open with a swoosh as he swiftly made his way out.</p><p>Kylo moved to stand by Kasari who was still kneeling before him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We won\u2019t have much time before Hux returns,\u201d he said, casting his eyes down upon her.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have far to go before arriving at Hux\u2019s private quarters as the highest, most elite officials and staff shared the same floor as the Supreme Leader. Kylo ordered Kasari to stand watch and alert him if any suspicious activity arose via their comlink. She was hesitant at first, prefering to go with him should he need assistance in his search, but Kylo reassured her that her standing watch was needed more.</p><p>He punched in his keycode on the datapad just outside the door. A small red light flashed, announcing that he\u2019d been cleared. As the door slid open, he stepped inside.</p><p>Kylo took a moment to consider Hux\u2019s chambers. The floors were the same shiny black material found throughout the <i>Finalizer.</i> Like all other cabins on the ship, it was designed to be distinctly utilitarian, but unlike Kylo\u2019s chambers which had very little personal possessions (save for his private collection of Jedi and Sith artifacts), Hux\u2019s quarters was filled with trinkets neatly displayed or tucked away in their respective places.</p><p>The charcoal walls were adorned with certifications from some of the best primary schools and universities the Core worlds could offer. One wall in particular was covered in various medals: some from his time at the university and others obtained from his achievements in the First Order. Hux was nothing if not ambitious. Kylo could acknowledge that.</p><p>He crossed the room and began browsing through the small collection of books nested on a shelf above Hux\u2019s desk, which held many works centered around military strategy during the days of the Rebellion. Another book highlighted prominent military leaders throughout the ages on both sides of the war. Then there was another one with a small tuft of paper sticking up through the pages like a flag. Thinking that it might offer up some useful insight, Kylo reached for the book and thumbed through the pages until he reached the one Hux had marked. </p><p>At the top of the page, there was a portrait of an officer wearing a First Order uniform with an impressive decoration of medals and pins adorning his left breast panel indicating his rank as a senior-level officer. Looking at his face, his hard eyes were an icy, pale blue that appeared to stare right through you. He looked like a man who didn\u2019t give a damn about anyone who stood in his way. Ruthless was likely a more accurate description. But perhaps the most striking feature he possessed was a crown of bright red hair.</p><p>This was Hux\u2019s father.</p><p>Sure enough, the name included under the photo confirmed his suspicions. While Kylo didn\u2019t know much about the late Commandant Brendol Hux, he had heard stories about his harsh command. This was not a man you wanted to cross, unless of course you had a death wish. </p><p>Not wanting to waste any more time, Kylo shut the book and returned it back to its usual place on the shelf.</p><p>Nothing else around his desk was out of place. Everything was neat and tidy, so Kylo chose to move toward his wardrobe after running his hand along the underside of the desk to check for hidden drawers. Finding none, he moved on.</p><p>Unlike his own wardrobe, which mostly contained items in the darkest of blacks, Hux actually had some shades of gray and red mixed in amongst the otherwise neutral color scheme of the First Order uniforms. Oddly enough, there was one very red cape tucked away in the back of the closet behind the coats and jackets. This would surely make his red headed foe stick out like a sore thumb, Kylo thought.</p><p>Moving on after digging in between and behind the racks of hanging clothes, Kylo began opening all the drawers. One drawer that neatly held a set of belts with highly polished buckles contained a severely weathered book, its pages frayed at the edges. </p><p>Upon first glance, Kylo estimated this book to be 1,000 years old or more. The simple cover itself reminded him of the sacred Jedi texts Luke kept in his private room at the temple, the same ones that were now in Rey\u2019s possession, minus a few pages that Kylo pulled for himself. Those were safely locked away on Mustafar in Darth Vader\u2019s castle. Snoke had been in possession of the castle for years, but since Kylo had become his apprentice, Snoke had released any hold over it, claiming that it was Kylo\u2019s birthright to have it. In that castle, Kylo only kept a handful of his most prized possessions, including a few Jedi and Sith holocrons.</p><p>Carefully, he lifted the book out of the drawer and crossed the room to take a seat at Hux\u2019s desk to have better light to examine the book.</p><p>Kylo gingerly cracked open the cover revealing pages of text written in a language long forgotten by most in the galaxy, but not to Kylo. He was perhaps one of the few people left who could interpret its secrets for it was the same language found in one of the books Kylo had read while studying the many applications of the Force. The book before him, however, and the one he interpreted were vastly different. For starters, the book at Luke\u2019s temple contained explanations in theory of what could be accomplished with the Force - Jedi mind tricks, healing, etc. - this one it seemed carried the knowledge of the Sith and the realities of how they used the Force, particularly in times of war.</p><p><i>This must be from the Jedi-Sith war which began in 1032 B.B.Y.</i>, he thought. <i>Wow</i>. He believed all the holocrons and texts were lost at this time from both the Jedi and the Sith. It was rare to find any recording written or spoken from the Sith since tradition dictated that knowledge be passed down verbally from master to apprentice. The Sith guarded their secrets well.</p><p>But the discovery of this book begged the question: how in the name of the Force did Hux find one of these texts? Maybe the more important question was: why would Hux keep it? It was no secret that Hux was afraid of the Force. All Kylo had to do was shoot his arm out and pretend like he was about to Force choke him to make the man jump out of his skin. Truly, Hux hated the Force. Which brought Kylo back to his question: why would Hux keep a Sith text?</p><p>Curiosity and, if Kylo was being honest, excitement flooded through him at the idea of reading a Sith text. He\u2019d always loved to read, especially when he was younger and had more time to do so. His favorite areas of study were Sith and Jedi lore, along with the political history of the galaxy and, naturally, the rise and fall of his grandfather, Darth Vader. He particularly liked learning about his life as a Jedi before the fall of the Republic.</p><p>As he began thumbing through the pages, he noticed that some boasted highly detailed illustrations of Force techniques. One illustration in particular begged Kylo to stop his casual reading.</p><p>At first glance, the drawing of two heads facing opposite directions with a paler wavelength shared between them caught his breath. It appeared as though he discovered the mystery behind how Force bonds work, but what he stumbled upon instead was a description of a Sith technique they called \u201ctransfer essence.\u201d</p><p>According to the text before him, transfer essence or transfer life as some called it, was a more radical dark side power used by Sith Lords to cheat death again and again. Usually with the help of a trusted servant, these ancient darksiders were able to transfer their soul or consciousness into a new vessel - a living or inanimate object.</p><p>Kylo\u2019s blood ran cold as his greatest fear came crashing down upon him.</p><p>This would be the key to immortality.</p><p>Snoke\u2026he thought in shear panic.</p><p>Would this is why Hux would keep this text? Would it even be possible for Hux to revive Snoke?</p><p>The thought that settled into his mind took hold like the ice storms of Hosnia. A thought that threatened to undo everything. A thought that filled Kylo with the same fear and dread he\u2019d felt as a boy when his trusted uncle had come in the middle of the night to murder him.</p><p>Snoke could still be alive.</p><p>Snoke could still come for him.</p><p>He would never be free of his master.</p><p><br></p><p><b><a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/173490601776/chapter-1-hi-tumblr-friends-i-basically-created\">Chapter 1</a> | <a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/173891134971/chapter-2\">Chapter 2</a></b> | <a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/174402002331/chapter-3\"><b>Chapter 3</b></a> | <a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/174628348986/chapter-4\"><b>Chapter 4</b></a> <b>| <a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/174826099461/chapter-5\">Chapter 5</a> |<a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/175287798936/chapter-6\">Chapter 6</a></b> | <b><a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/175950778116/chapter-7\">Chapter 7</a></b> |<b> <a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/176732611636/chapter-8\">Chapter 8</a></b> <b>| <a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/177063569731/chapter-9\">Chapter 9</a> | <a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/179078845582/chapter-10\">Chapter 10</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://whillsofstars.tumblr.com/post/181677898506/chapter-12\">Chapter 12</a></b><br></p>",
                "content": "<p>KYLO REN&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p><p>Kylo Ren&rsquo;s uncharacteristically good mood persisted over the next couple weeks, which only made everyone who came in contact with him uncomfortable. No one quite knew how to respond to his more relaxed, uplifted attitude. It was well-known within the First Order that Kylo Ren was as serious as they come, with a raging temper to match when provoked. He was not a man to be trifled with, but even more so, he was not a man known for being happy. Ever. </p><p>Sometimes he was met with suspicion, especially when it came to General Hux. Being the type of man who ascended to his coveted position through less than favorable methods, Armitage assumed there were secret operations that he wasn&rsquo;t privy to, and that made him nervous. While it was not as Hux feared, Kylo couldn&rsquo;t help exploiting his suspicions for the time being. Armitage shared more detailed information in his reports than he had previously, clearly trying to demonstrate everything he has accomplished on behalf of the First Order. The additional insight was particularly helpful as it gave away more details about Hux&rsquo;s comings and goings which, in turn, Kylo passed along to his knights while they continued to monitor him.</p><p>Secretly, the only two people in the galaxy who knew the source of his new attitude were himself and Rey.</p><p>While he had waited with Rey as she recovered from the attack by the bounty hunters, Kylo had witnessed something that truly moved him at his core. While caught between an open Force bond and an interruption from that Resistance scum, Rey had done more for Kylo&rsquo;s ego in a brief second than anyone had in years. When she withdrew her hand from the golden boy of the Resistance, Dameron knew it for what it was - rejection. Little did he know that resting in Rey&rsquo;s other hand was Kylo&rsquo;s, one that she had intentionally reached for and encouraged to stay. She had chosen him. Once again, like she had when she arrived on the Supremacy, Rey had chosen him and that meant more to Kylo than he cared to admit. Throughout his life, no one had shown as much support as Rey had in those two moments. Yes, Snoke had been supportive of him, encouraging his studies of the Darkside, but there was always a hidden agenda. With Rey, there were no strings attached.</p><p>Despite Snoke connecting them through the Force, the bond had remained open. It was the Force at work. Kylo knew it. The Force wants balance restored to the galaxy. Maybe, just maybe, he was moving one step closer to accomplishing it. Rey&rsquo;s request for him to stay by her side fueled his belief that she would join him. Could it be that the vision he saw when they touched hands would come to pass? Kylo certainly hoped so. </p><p>She was his equal in the Force, her light being the perfect counterbalance to his darkness. If she would allow it, Kylo would still jump at the opportunity to provide her with proper training in the Force. He would show her all the power that the Darkside could offer and while he didn&rsquo;t agree with the strict and stunted dogma of the Jedi teachings, there was still plenty to gain from their practice. Kylo would take the best teachings from both the Jedi and the Sith to begin a new era of Force users. Some students would foster more light than darkness or vice versa, and that would be okay. Never again would a Force-user be trained to shun part of who they were.</p><p>The thought of this new order and the potential for future Force-sensitives only propelled his unusually good mood leading him to think more about Rey. He wondered what she would think of his plan to balance the galaxy. Would she like it? Would she want to be a part of it? </p><p>Truth be told, he had no idea. </p><p>During the brief moments when their bond had opened, neither of them would discuss their personal aspirations, choosing instead to stick with safer conversation topics. After what happened almost a year ago, it was clear that neither of them was as trusting of one another as they once were. That same trust would take time to build. Kylo hoped that it would happen sooner rather than later, which brought his thought back to the task at hand: forcing their bond to open at will.</p><p>Kylo had been meditating on the Force in his quarters while using Vader&rsquo;s mask as an aid to channel his power. He always found that it was easier to concentrate in the presence of his grandfather&rsquo;s mask, as if Anakin Skywalker himself was guiding him.</p><p>Sometimes he would plea to his grandfather&rsquo;s spirit to show him the ways of the Force, and today was no different. Kylo had been attempting to open the bond for a little over an hour, only to hit an impenetrable wall every time he found Rey&rsquo;s presence in the Force. Her signature shown in the Force with an intensity that rivaled the brightest star in the galaxy. Time and time again, when he felt just a little closer to opening the bond, his concentration would crumble, the effort often drawing his strength away.</p><p>But despite his failed attempts, he kept trying. Since it reopened, he could feel it getting stronger and stronger every time they were connected. They could now see each other&rsquo;s surroundings, a feat they were unable to do previously. It also seemed as though their emotions could bleed through the bond at unexpected times. He will never forget the fear that pierced his heart when she called his name across the stars moments before she was captured.</p><p>It was these revelations that kept him going, that persuaded him to keep trying.</p><p>Once again, he focused on his breathing. The feeling of life-giving oxygen passing in and out of his lungs felt like a life-line that helped center his thoughts. If there was anything the Jedi got right, it was their insistence that proper breathing techniques enhanced the meditating experience. </p><p>When he finally felt as though his mind had been cleared and tranquility hung around him, he opened himself up to the living Force, pleading with it to show him the key to opening the bond he shared with Rey.</p><p><i>Breathe in and out</i>, he thought exhaling slowly.</p><p>Slowly, the darkness that surrounded him began to reveal a faint glow, and from what his heightened senses told him, it was light years away. </p><p>When he was sure this was what he was looking for, Kylo refocused his efforts so that all of his thoughts were directed at this small glowing presence in the Force, encouraging it to blossom. Warmth spread through his body, beginning at the crown of his head and moving down to his toes. The feeling reminded him of the warm summers he spent by the lakes on Chandrila - welcoming and at the same time thrilling. </p><p>Soon enough, what was once a faint glow in the darkness was now a light that shown with the intensity of the Chandrila sun. The fervor of it all made his skin crawl with excitement. It made him feel alive.</p><p>&ldquo;Rey,&rdquo; he breathed. The light she carried within her was so strong. She was the galaxy&rsquo;s counter to the darkness he possessed.</p><p>After pausing a few moments to admire the strength of her Force signature, he went right to work summoning his energy, and began slowly pressing it against hers. </p><p>&ldquo;Open,&rdquo; he said in an almost inaudible whisper.</p><p>Upon his command, he sensed that the walls which separated them began to dissolve, but like the intensity of the light, they too were also strong. All of Kylo&rsquo;s efforts were aimed at one thing and one thing only, slowly chipping away at the Force&rsquo;s barrier. But just as soon as he began the task at hand, his exhaustion overtook his concentration and he awoke to find himself sitting before his grandfather&rsquo;s mask, cold and alone once more.</p><p>He let out a growl of frustration. He had been so close this time. He could feel it. </p><p>Unable to control his emotions, he reached for the nearest object he could find - his data pad - &nbsp;and hurled into the wall, showering the room with glass and metal pieces. He stood there savagely drawing in one ragged breath after another as the blood in his veins continued to boil. </p><p><i>Why can&rsquo;t I get it to open?,</i> he thought. <i>I am the most powerful Darkside user in the entire galaxy, the scion to the mighty Skywalker line, trained in both the light and the dark. </i></p><p>Just as he reached for another object, an unexpected knock came from the door to his chambers.</p><p>In his rage, he had almost forgotten that he summoned his knights to report on Hux&rsquo;s comings and goings. </p><p><i>Kriff</i>, he thought.</p><p>He collected himself for a brief moment before permitting his knights to enter his personal chambers. He did not want them to witness his weakness. A man who cannot control his emotions is not fit to lead the First Order. If they saw him in a state of weakness, surely his knights too would doubt his ability to command the Knights of Ren.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Kylo used the Force to slide the door open. &ldquo;You may enter,&rdquo; he said, trying his best to keep his voice level. </p><p>Jaster and Kasari Ren stepped over the threshold, the lightsabers at their hips clinking against their armour. They proceeded until they were within a few paces from where Kylo stood. Both of them slowly dropped to their knees and bowed their heads in a display of respect for the Master of the Knights of Ren. </p><p>Kylo had been itching to hear this week&rsquo;s report from his knights. Ever since he ordered Jaster and Kasari to shadow Hux, their findings had been less than he had hoped. From what they could tell, Hux maintained a normal schedule, free from unusual diversions. If it did change, it was for a trivial endeavor, such as a follow-up meeting with an officer or a casual trip to fill an extra cup of caf while he worked. Unfortunately, what happened behind the closed doors of his private chambers still remained a mystery, but it&rsquo;s not as though he spent much time there according to his knights.</p><p><i>Let&rsquo;s hope there&rsquo;s something new this week.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Reports?&rdquo; he asked, although admittingly, it came off as more of a command than a request. And did it sound a little harsh? It must have as both knights hesitated for the briefest of moments before Kasari broke the silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Master, I beg your apologies, but there is nothing new to add to my report this week. In the shifts that I had followed the general, nothing seemed amiss. He comes and goes at the same time, following his schedule to a tee,&rdquo; she said, her voice muffled by her mask. Continuing to clarify her point she started, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s met with a few new First Order staff, but it&rsquo;s nothing out of the ordinary. They mostly discuss upcoming projects or updates as it concerns the Resistance, your excellency.&rdquo; </p><p>Before Kylo could ask another question, Jaster chimed in unexpectedly. </p><p>&ldquo;I will echo Kasari Ren&rsquo;s report, Master. I also have not noticed a break in General Hux&rsquo;s activities,&rdquo; he stated rather dryly. &ldquo;It does not appear as though the general is plotting against the First Order, at least not publicly.&rdquo;</p><p>This was not what Kylo wanted to hear. It had been weeks since his knights had been assigned to follow Hux. He knew both of them were tiring from his order and he could feel their distaste for such a mundane activity, though he knew neither of them would openly say something. At a different time, before he assumed the mantle of Supreme Leader, Kasari Ren might have been more candid. They did have more of a casual relationship growing up.</p><p>Outside of the hard facts provided in their report, Kylo also wanted to know their thoughts. Did they have reason to believe Hux was up to something behind closed doors in his quarters? Surely after noting his every move for weeks, they would have a hunch. With that thought, he moved to ask, &ldquo;Do either of you have reason to believe that he&rsquo;s plotting something behind closed doors? Do you think there&rsquo;s value in bugging his personal chambers?&rdquo;</p><p>Without missing a beat, Kasari was quick to share her opinion, &ldquo;I think it could certainly help. That&rsquo;s the only place on the ship where we can&rsquo;t watch him.&rdquo; She paused a moment releasing a tired sigh before continuing. &ldquo;What is it you want us to look for exactly? Is there another reason why you want us to follow him?&rdquo; </p><p>Of course Kasari would push back. She would often question Luke&rsquo;s instructions at the Jedi Temple, not to purposefully challenge his authority, but to better understand the reasons why things were done. Kasari, empathetic to her core, wanted to visualize what brought the Jedi of old to adopt their rules. Today, Kylo could sense Kasari&rsquo;s intent. She wanted to understand why Kylo, Master of the Knights of Ren and leader of the First Order, would have such a fixation on Hux. She wanted to help him. Some things never seemed to changed.</p><p>However much Kylo wanted to share the burden of his worries - a potential coup, more assassination attempts, secret missions - with his knights, he decided against it. This was something that he wanted to keep to himself. Plus, these would only lead to more questions that would become too dangerous to answer. Where would he even begin to explain the treacherous acts he&rsquo;s committed, all because of his fascination with the Lightsided scavenger? Murdering their master Snoke? Ruining Hux&rsquo;s plans to bring Rey to justice? No. He would not be giving any more details than what was necessary. </p><p>&ldquo;The details as to why I want you to watch Hux are irrelevant,&rdquo; he stated sharply. He hoped this came off like a warning to let the subject go. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a secret that Hux and I have not seen eye-to-eye on a number of different initiatives. For now, he&rsquo;s compliant and goes along without much resistance. I want to ensure it stays that way.&rdquo;</p><p>He left the weight of his words hang in the air for a brief moment, allowing the silence to fill the room. Kasari and Jaster Ren would have to live with the fact that this was all the information they would be receiving from Kylo at the moment. </p><p>When the silence continued to grow, Kasari dropped her head back down. Was this a show of submission or frustration? Kylo couldn&rsquo;t tell. He reached out and pressed his mind against Kasari&rsquo;s hoping to find the thoughts that remained unspoken. She immediately became aware of his presence and, knowing full well why he was attempting to read her mind, threw her mental shields up preventing him from diving any further. </p><p>To Snoke, her clear unwillingness to share her thoughts would have been seen as insubordination. Kasari would have been shot straight through with lightning for such a display of disrespect, but Kylo was not Snoke. He wasn&rsquo;t going to use the same cruel tactics on his knights, and so decided against probing further. If she wanted to say something, she should feel comfortable to do so in her own time. Besides, he wanted to return to his meditation, and his knights should really return to their posts.</p><p>Kylo was growing tired of a lack of information about Hux. It was time to push things along. If you wanted to get something done, sometimes the best thing to do was to do it yourself. Luckily for Kylo, he had the protection of his knights to back him up.</p><p>If it was true that the only time his knights couldn&rsquo;t oversee Hux was when he was in his personal quarters, then maybe Kylo ought to see what Hux has been up to when not under the watchful eyes of his knights. As the Supreme Leader, Kylo&rsquo;s personal keycode granted him full access to any and all locations on the ship, and that included the personal quarters of all the ship&rsquo;s personnel, no matter the rank. Depending on the time, Kylo could probably slip in and out unnoticed.</p><p>Actually, now that he was thinking about it, Hux was supposed to be in a meeting for a few hours today with the military officers - his command. Kylo quickly glanced at the chrono mounted in the paneling. Yep. He&rsquo;ll still be away for another two hours at the minimum. These meetings usually go longer than expected. This just may be the break Kylo needed.</p><p>With that, his mind was decided. He would just go through Hux&rsquo;s quarters himself and get to the bottom of this. Maybe if he found nothing, it would finally put his mind at ease.</p><p>&ldquo;Jaster Ren, you will resume watch over Hux for the remainder of the week, beginning the minute you are dismissed,&rdquo; Kylo said shortly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Master.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you should know, he is in a meeting right now. If the meeting is cut short for any reason, you are to alert Kasari via your comlink. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Master.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kasari and I will be pushing this along. We&rsquo;re going to bug his quarters, but first we need to see if he has anything to hide.&rdquo; </p><p>At this, he turned to both Jaster and Kasari.</p><p>&ldquo;Jaster, Kasari,&rdquo; he said, his voice low, conveying the seriousness of what he was about to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Master?&rdquo; they questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;You will speak of this to no one. We cannot have General Hux catch on to what we are about to do. Am I making myself clear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Master,&rdquo; Kasari and Jaster answered immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jaster, you may take your leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Jaster rose at his command and strode across Kylo&rsquo;s chambers, pausing only to allow the entrance to open with a swoosh as he swiftly made his way out.</p><p>Kylo moved to stand by Kasari who was still kneeling before him.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. We won&rsquo;t have much time before Hux returns,&rdquo; he said, casting his eyes down upon her.</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t have far to go before arriving at Hux&rsquo;s private quarters as the highest, most elite officials and staff shared the same floor as the Supreme Leader. Kylo ordered Kasari to stand watch and alert him if any suspicious activity arose via their comlink. She was hesitant at first, prefering to go with him should he need assistance in his search, but Kylo reassured her that her standing watch was needed more.</p><p>He punched in his keycode on the datapad just outside the door. A small red light flashed, announcing that he&rsquo;d been cleared. As the door slid open, he stepped inside.</p><p>Kylo took a moment to consider Hux&rsquo;s chambers. The floors were the same shiny black material found throughout the <i>Finalizer.</i> Like all other cabins on the ship, it was designed to be distinctly utilitarian, but unlike Kylo&rsquo;s chambers which had very little personal possessions (save for his private collection of Jedi and Sith artifacts), Hux&rsquo;s quarters was filled with trinkets neatly displayed or tucked away in their respective places.</p><p>The charcoal walls were adorned with certifications from some of the best primary schools and universities the Core worlds could offer. One wall in particular was covered in various medals: some from his time at the university and others obtained from his achievements in the First Order. Hux was nothing if not ambitious. Kylo could acknowledge that.</p><p>He crossed the room and began browsing through the small collection of books nested on a shelf above Hux&rsquo;s desk, which held many works centered around military strategy during the days of the Rebellion. Another book highlighted prominent military leaders throughout the ages on both sides of the war. Then there was another one with a small tuft of paper sticking up through the pages like a flag. Thinking that it might offer up some useful insight, Kylo reached for the book and thumbed through the pages until he reached the one Hux had marked. </p><p>At the top of the page, there was a portrait of an officer wearing a First Order uniform with an impressive decoration of medals and pins adorning his left breast panel indicating his rank as a senior-level officer. Looking at his face, his hard eyes were an icy, pale blue that appeared to stare right through you. He looked like a man who didn&rsquo;t give a damn about anyone who stood in his way. Ruthless was likely a more accurate description. But perhaps the most striking feature he possessed was a crown of bright red hair.</p><p>This was Hux&rsquo;s father.</p><p>Sure enough, the name included under the photo confirmed his suspicions. While Kylo didn&rsquo;t know much about the late Commandant Brendol Hux, he had heard stories about his harsh command. This was not a man you wanted to cross, unless of course you had a death wish. </p><p>Not wanting to waste any more time, Kylo shut the book and returned it back to its usual place on the shelf.</p><p>Nothing else around his desk was out of place. Everything was neat and tidy, so Kylo chose to move toward his wardrobe after running his hand along the underside of the desk to check for hidden drawers. Finding none, he moved on.</p><p>Unlike his own wardrobe, which mostly contained items in the darkest of blacks, Hux actually had some shades of gray and red mixed in amongst the otherwise neutral color scheme of the First Order uniforms. Oddly enough, there was one very red cape tucked away in the back of the closet behind the coats and jackets. This would surely make his red headed foe stick out like a sore thumb, Kylo thought.</p><p>Moving on after digging in between and behind the racks of hanging clothes, Kylo began opening all the drawers. One drawer that neatly held a set of belts with highly polished buckles contained a severely weathered book, its pages frayed at the edges. </p><p>Upon first glance, Kylo estimated this book to be 1,000 years old or more. The simple cover itself reminded him of the sacred Jedi texts Luke kept in his private room at the temple, the same ones that were now in Rey&rsquo;s possession, minus a few pages that Kylo pulled for himself. Those were safely locked away on Mustafar in Darth Vader&rsquo;s castle. Snoke had been in possession of the castle for years, but since Kylo had become his apprentice, Snoke had released any hold over it, claiming that it was Kylo&rsquo;s birthright to have it. In that castle, Kylo only kept a handful of his most prized possessions, including a few Jedi and Sith holocrons.</p><p>Carefully, he lifted the book out of the drawer and crossed the room to take a seat at Hux&rsquo;s desk to have better light to examine the book.</p><p>Kylo gingerly cracked open the cover revealing pages of text written in a language long forgotten by most in the galaxy, but not to Kylo. He was perhaps one of the few people left who could interpret its secrets for it was the same language found in one of the books Kylo had read while studying the many applications of the Force. The book before him, however, and the one he interpreted were vastly different. For starters, the book at Luke&rsquo;s temple contained explanations in theory of what could be accomplished with the Force - Jedi mind tricks, healing, etc. - this one it seemed carried the knowledge of the Sith and the realities of how they used the Force, particularly in times of war.</p><p><i>This must be from the Jedi-Sith war which began in 1032 B.B.Y.</i>, he thought. <i>Wow</i>. He believed all the holocrons and texts were lost at this time from both the Jedi and the Sith. It was rare to find any recording written or spoken from the Sith since tradition dictated that knowledge be passed down verbally from master to apprentice. The Sith guarded their secrets well.</p><p>But the discovery of this book begged the question: how in the name of the Force did Hux find one of these texts? Maybe the more important question was: why would Hux keep it? It was no secret that Hux was afraid of the Force. All Kylo had to do was shoot his arm out and pretend like he was about to Force choke him to make the man jump out of his skin. Truly, Hux hated the Force. Which brought Kylo back to his question: why would Hux keep a Sith text?</p><p>Curiosity and, if Kylo was being honest, excitement flooded through him at the idea of reading a Sith text. He&rsquo;d always loved to read, especially when he was younger and had more time to do so. His favorite areas of study were Sith and Jedi lore, along with the political history of the galaxy and, naturally, the rise and fall of his grandfather, Darth Vader.
