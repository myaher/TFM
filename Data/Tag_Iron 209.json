the world expected tony stark to be fun, young, and reckless, and so that\u2019s what he would be. he threw himself into the party scene, trying to forget, trying to escape. another shot. another girl. another wall. an iron facade to hide the chinks.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he insisted, as the scalpel carved into him, trying to distract himself. but then the knife sliced deeper and he couldn\u2019t hold back a scream, and not even iron was enough to stop the pain. the masked faces bared down on him and suddenly he wasn\u2019t made of iron anymore - instead he was less than human.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he cried, but it felt like a plea. the water kept pouring down, drowning him, choking him. not even iron could stop it. iron may be strong, but it is hopelessly heavy, and in the end it only sinks.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron, </i>he whispered encouragingly to himself in a cave in afghanistan. just empty words with empty meaning, and yet they ignited something in him. he was an iron soul in an iron suit, and he was destined to survive, to fix things, to right his wrongs. he was made of iron, and for the first time he knew what that meant.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, obsidiah taunted, repeating his father\u2019s memorable catchphrase, carving into tony\u2019s chest, and simultaneously stabbing him in the back. what he didn\u2019t say floated unspoken in the air between them, <i>but</i> <i>even iron can be disposed of.</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he thought as he stepped onto the podium, the eyes of the entire world on him, cameras flashing and reporters poised. he glanced down at his prepped speech, trying to calm his nerves. the perfect cover up they had crafted for him, the perfect story. a lie. he opened his mouth to recite it but instead he found himself discarding the notecards, shedding the skin he always worn, reclaiming his title, his legacy.<i> I am iron man.</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he chastised himself. it was meant to be encouraging, meant to remind him of everything he had done, to motivate himself. instead it fell flat, tasting bitter in his mouth and only serving to make him falter. was iron strong enough to hold the weight of the world? could iron handle the pressure? or would it bend? would it break?</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron,</i> he scolded. so he ignored the attacks of the press, on his decisions, on his character. the glares of his \u201cfriends\u201d, his fellow avengers, who didn\u2019t trust him. he didn\u2019t listen to the calls of <i>selfish, greedy, cold, uncaring. </i>he put on his sunglasses and pulled up his mask, indifferent and charismatic. he didn\u2019t let them see the sting. </p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he scoffed, and it felt like a joke. sounded like a bitter irony. because his father had been a stark man and he was crushed like aluminum. because he was a stark man, and yet he felt so weak. stark men aren\u2019t made of iron, instead they\u2019re cursed to feel as heavy as the dense metal, weighted down by iron expectations, but doomed to shatter as easily as glass.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, reverberated in the air. no one said it but it echoed all the same. they were all thinking it. <i>grow up tony. get it together. don\u2019t be weak. </i>it wasn\u2019t just a tag line, it was an expectation. he was a hero, he needed to act like one. who cared that his hands shook, or that he woke up screaming, or that he craved whiskey like it was the only thing that could save him? who cared if he didn\u2019t think he handle handle the weight of the guilt any longer? the pain of destruction and death and lives lost? <i>put your feelings aside tony, be a hero. be iron. </i>and so he was.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he thought bitterly as steve\u2019s shield slammed against his chest, <i>isn\u2019t that burden enough? </i>iron is meant to withstand anything, the attack of a blade or the bullet of a gun, but somehow betrayal seeped through the cracks of his armor. the attack of a shield, a defensive instrument, meant to protect rather than harm, was somehow infinitely more painful than the attack of any other weapon. some part of tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he deserved it, and the rest of him screamed that he did.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron,</i> he said to himself, oh-so-tiredly, after taking peter\u2019s suit. peter would have to learn. he had endangered other people, and tony just didn\u2019t want him to be led the wrong way. tony wanted him to be <i>better</i>. but then he faltered. peter wasn\u2019t a stark man. he was just a boy. he already had a heart of gold, wasn\u2019t that already better than a soul of iron? he felt a pang in his chest, <i>was he doing the right thing?</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he reflected warily, staring thanos down. but there are some things not even iron can withstand. destiny had led him down this path, given him an iron soul and titanium armor, and told him to face off against a titan. was it enough?

the world expected tony stark to be fun, young, and reckless, and so that\u2019s what he would be. he threw himself into the party scene, trying to forget, trying to escape. another shot. another girl. another wall. an iron facade to hide the chinks.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he insisted, as the scalpel carved into him, trying to distract himself. but then the knife sliced deeper and he couldn\u2019t hold back a scream, and not even iron was enough to stop the pain. the masked faces bared down on him and suddenly he wasn\u2019t made of iron anymore - instead he was less than human.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he cried, but it felt like a plea. the water kept pouring down, drowning him, choking him. not even iron could stop it. iron may be strong, but it is hopelessly heavy, and in the end it only sinks.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron, </i>he whispered encouragingly to himself in a cave in afghanistan. just empty words with empty meaning, and yet they ignited something in him. he was an iron soul in an iron suit, and he was destined to survive, to fix things, to right his wrongs. he was made of iron, and for the first time he knew what that meant.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, obsidiah taunted, repeating his father\u2019s memorable catchphrase, carving into tony\u2019s chest, and simultaneously stabbing him in the back. what he didn\u2019t say floated unspoken in the air between them, <i>but</i> <i>even iron can be disposed of.</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he thought as he stepped onto the podium, the eyes of the entire world on him, cameras flashing and reporters poised. he glanced down at his prepped speech, trying to calm his nerves. the perfect cover up they had crafted for him, the perfect story. a lie. he opened his mouth to recite it but instead he found himself discarding the notecards, shedding the skin he always worn, reclaiming his title, his legacy.<i> I am iron man.</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he chastised himself. it was meant to be encouraging, meant to remind him of everything he had done, to motivate himself. instead it fell flat, tasting bitter in his mouth and only serving to make him falter. was iron strong enough to hold the weight of the world? could iron handle the pressure? or would it bend? would it break?</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron,</i> he scolded. so he ignored the attacks of the press, on his decisions, on his character. the glares of his \u201cfriends\u201d, his fellow avengers, who didn\u2019t trust him. he didn\u2019t listen to the calls of <i>selfish, greedy, cold, uncaring. </i>he put on his sunglasses and pulled up his mask, indifferent and charismatic. he didn\u2019t let them see the sting. </p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he scoffed, and it felt like a joke. sounded like a bitter irony. because his father had been a stark man and he was crushed like aluminum. because he was a stark man, and yet he felt so weak. stark men aren\u2019t made of iron, instead they\u2019re cursed to feel as heavy as the dense metal, weighted down by iron expectations, but doomed to shatter as easily as glass.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, reverberated in the air. no one said it but it echoed all the same. they were all thinking it. <i>grow up tony. get it together. don\u2019t be weak. </i>it wasn\u2019t just a tag line, it was an expectation. he was a hero, he needed to act like one. who cared that his hands shook, or that he woke up screaming, or that he craved whiskey like it was the only thing that could save him? who cared if he didn\u2019t think he handle handle the weight of the guilt any longer? the pain of destruction and death and lives lost? <i>put your feelings aside tony, be a hero. be iron. </i>and so he was.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he thought bitterly as steve\u2019s shield slammed against his chest, <i>isn\u2019t that burden enough? </i>iron is meant to withstand anything, the attack of a blade or the bullet of a gun, but somehow betrayal seeped through the cracks of his armor. the attack of a shield, a defensive instrument, meant to protect rather than harm, was somehow infinitely more painful than the attack of any other weapon. some part of tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he deserved it, and the rest of him screamed that he did.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron,</i> he said to himself, oh-so-tiredly, after taking peter\u2019s suit. peter would have to learn. he had endangered other people, and tony just didn\u2019t want him to be led the wrong way. tony wanted him to be <i>better</i>. but then he faltered. peter wasn\u2019t a stark man. he was just a boy. he already had a heart of gold, wasn\u2019t that already better than a soul of iron? he felt a pang in his chest, <i>was he doing the right thing?</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he reflected warily, staring thanos down. but there are some things not even iron can withstand. destiny had led him down this path, given him an iron soul and titanium armor, and told him to face off against a titan. was it enough? an iron soul against a stone heart. only when the blade plunged through his body, piercing his core, did he realize iron never could\u2019ve been enough.</p><p>a snap. </p><p>(iron and stone and gold alike all crumble.)</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he chanted internally, numb in disbelief, as a boy with a heart of gold fell forward, begging to be saved. <i>you\u2019re alright</i>. the words were as heavy as his heart. they fell flat. he met the eyes of his kid and watched as he turned to dust. </p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he mourned. <i>but even iron can fall apart.</i> his soul was leaden, with grief, guilt, sorrow. as heavy as iron, but without any of the strength. dense and hard and cold, just empty barren weight. </p><p><i>stark men are made of iron.</i></p><p>the phrase had followed him his whole life, but he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to be made of iron anymore. for the first time it didn\u2019t sound like something to aspire to. for iron, in the end, had been as useless and fallible as anything else. it hadn\u2019t served to protect him. he didn\u2019t want to be cold and hard and sharp anymore. he wanted to feel. even if it killed him.</p><p>the iron walls he had been building since birth turned to dust with peter, leaving behind only raw emotion. raw pain. </p><p>at his core he wasn\u2019t made of iron, or gold, or even stone.</p><p>he was only human. </p><p>a grieving parent, with an iron soul and golden armor, who was chosen by the universe. a man armed with brains, but driven by his heart, destined to fight until the very end. a simple man. a noble hero.</p><p>in the end he was made of iron because he chose to be. </p><p>not because he was a stark. not because the world demanded it of him. not because he was expected to be. </p><p>in the end he was made of iron because he reached into the depths of his soul and drew strength from his core to save his kid.</p><p>he chose to how to define himself, he decided what his identity was - he was iron man.</p></p>",
