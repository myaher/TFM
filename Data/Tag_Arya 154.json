        "body": "<p>Something i see again and again in the ASoIaF fandom is that people who love Arya do so because she rejects femininity. As someone who is feminine, i find this kind of annoying because honestly femininity has nothing to do with how i feel about her. So here are my top five reasons for loving Arya Stark:</p><p><b>1. Her empathy\u00a0</b></p><p>\u201c<i>The bars were too narrow to pass a cup through, but Harwin and Gendry offered her a leg up. She planted a foot in Harwin&rsquo;s cupped hands, vaulted onto Gendry&rsquo;s shoulders, and grabbed the bars on top of the cage. The fat man turned his face up and pressed his cheek to the iron, and Arya poured the waterover him. He sucked at it eagerly and let it run down over his head and cheeks and hands, and then he licked the dampness off the bars. He would have licked Arya&rsquo;s fingers if she hadn&rsquo;t snatched them back. By the time she served the other two the same, a crowd had gathered to watch her. &ldquo;The Mad Huntsman will hear of this,&rdquo; a man threatened. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t like it. No, he won&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;\n- Arya V, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c\n\n<i>It was even worse than before; Lady Smallwood insisted that Arya take another bath, and cut and comb her hair besides; the dress she put her in this time was sort of lilac-colored, and decorated with little baby pearls. The only good thing about it was that it was so delicate that no one could expect her to ride in it. So the next morning as they broke their fast, Lady Smallwood gave her breeches, belt, and tunic to wear, and a brown doeskin jerkin dotted with iron studs. &ldquo;They were my son&rsquo;s things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He died when he was seven.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my lady.&rdquo; Arya suddenly felt bad for her, and ashamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I tore the acorn dress too. It was pretty</i>.&rdquo;\n- Arya IV, ASoS<br/></p><p><b>2. Her friendliness\u00a0</b></p><p><i>\u201c\n\nSansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with anybody. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher&rsquo;s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block.\u201d - </i>Sansa I, AGoT<br/></p><p>\u201c\n\n<i>Cat had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores. They bought clams and cockles from her, told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi. She never let that trouble her. Instead, she showed them all the fig, and told them they were camel cunts, which made them roar with laughter. Gyloro Dothare taught her filthy songs, and his brother Gyleno told her the best places to catch eels. The mummers off the Ship showed her how a hero stands, and taught her speeches from The Song of the Rhoyne, The Conqueror&rsquo;s Two Wives, and The Merchant&rsquo;s Lusty Lady. Quill, the sad-eyed little man who made up all the bawdy farces for the Ship, offered to teach her how a woman kisses, but Tagganaro smacked him with a codfish and put an end to that. Cossomo the Conjurer instructed her in sleight of hand. He could swallow mice and pull them from her ears. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s magic,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Cat said. &ldquo;The mouse was up your sleeve the whole time. I could see it moving.&rdquo;\n- </i>Cat of the Canals, AFfC</p><p><b>3. Her childishness\u00a0</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know what a brothel is.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I do so,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an inn, with girls.</i>&rdquo;\n- Arya V, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c\n\n<i>You know the words, but you are too proud to serve. A servant must be humble and obedient.&ldquo;<br/>&quot;I obey. I can be humbler than anyone<b>.</b></i>&rdquo;\n- The Ugly Little Girl, ADwD</p><p><b>4. Her leave-no-person-behind attitude\u00a0</b></p><p><i>\u201cHe&rsquo;s going to die, and the sooner he does it, the better for the rest of us. We should just leave him, like he says. If it was you or me hurt, you know he&rsquo;d leave us.&ldquo; They scrambled down a steep cut and up the other side, using roots for handholds. &quot;I&rsquo;m sick of carrying him, and I&rsquo;m sick of all his talk about yielding too. If he could stand up, I&rsquo;d knock his teeth in. Lommy&rsquo;s no use to anyone. That crying girl&rsquo;s no use either.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;You leave Weasel alone, she&rsquo;s just scared and hungry is all.&rdquo; Arya glanced back, but the girl was not following for once. Hot Pie must have grabbed her, like Gendry had told him.\u201d - </i>Arya V, ACoK<br/></p><p><i>\u201c\n\nShe would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, but she could not leave them. They were her pack, her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens. If the Mummers catch us, I&rsquo;ll tell them that I&rsquo;m Ned Stark&rsquo;s daughter and sister to the King in the North. I&rsquo;ll command them to take me to my brother, and to do no harm to Hot Pie and Gendry. They might not believe her, though, and even if they did &hellip; Lord Bolton was her brother&rsquo;s bannerman, but he frightened her all the same. I won&rsquo;t let them take us, she vowed silently, reaching back over her shoulder to touch the hilt of the sword that Gendry had stolen for her. I won&rsquo;t.\u201d - </i>Arya I, ASoS<br/></p><p><b>5. Her bravery\u00a0</b></p><p><i>\u201c\u00a0\n\nRobb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna, to show them their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. &ldquo;There are worse things than spiders and rats,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;This is where the dead walk.&rdquo; That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya&rsquo;s hand.<br/>\n\nWhen the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb&rsquo;s leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. &ldquo;You stupid,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;you scared the baby,&rdquo; but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too.\n\n\u201d - </i>Arya IV, AGoT<br/></p><p><b>\u201c\n\n</b><i>She should be more frightened herself, she knew. She was only ten, a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind who would gladly cut off her feet. Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal. The rain had washed the guard&rsquo;s blood off her fingers, she wore a swordacross her back, wolves were prowling through the dark like lean grey shadows, and Arya Stark was unafraid. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she whispered under her breath, the words that Syrio Forel had taught her, and Jaqen&rsquo;s words too, valar morghulis.\u201d - </i>Arya I, ASoS<br/></p>",

        "question": "Hi there, I\u2019ve seen people theorizing about Dany\u2019s death. That Jon or Arya or even childbirth will kill her, and to me, those seem like such unsatisfactory endings for her arc. I\u2019ve always believed Dany\u2019s fate is in her own hands and her own choices. So she either does become a savior/heroic sacrifice death OR she dies for her own hubris and means (eaten by dragon/fall from dragon/killed by fire). Anything else feels like bad writing. What do you think?",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>I would absolutely hate for Da\u20acnerys to die in childbirth. That would be pretty anticlimatic. I want her to go out in a blaze, like the last dragon she is. A really spectacular death. A hero from the other side, a woman who fulfills the role of the person who had good intentions and went awry. Yes, I want her death to be memorable. <br/></p><p>I wouldn\u2019t say it would be not like GRRM to do an anticlimatic death. I always suspected that Walder Frey in the books might just die from old age, because this is what occasionally happens with villains, but I doubt that GRRM has a death like that for a super important antagonist. <br/></p><p>As for how she will die, I am a bit torn about that. The Icarus imagery in her arc is very strong and this means that a fall from her dragon would be a possibility. There is also the fact that D herself seems to be convinced that fire \u201ccannot kill a dragon\u201d, and wouldn\u2019t it be nice if that turned out to be wrong - and both would indeed fit into the hubris and fall trope. <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrHV0A6XAqV1AbH1L0Bo2Bw\">@rose-of-red-lake</a> has speculated that the famous \u2018red door\u2019 might be a dragon\u2019s mouth. <br/></p><p>I always wanted her to die a Gollum death - which might come to pass via being eaten by a dragon or via fall from a dragon. I want her to think she has won it all, \u201cher presciousss\u201d only to fall to her death. It would be very nice, if she accidentally helps the case against the WW with her fall. <br/></p><p>I\u2019m not so sure about that any longer: I mean I always thought that GRRM wanted to create a beautiful antagonist, someone who would not be seen as a villain immediately, a beautiful Gollum. But D might also be Denethor, the betrayer in the midst of the peopel who fight against evil (and Denethor dies in flames as well!). As much as I would like D to mirror Gollum, I think that there are many more parallels to Denethor and that she will forsake the cause against the WW because she wants to secure her claim. So if she goes for King\u2019s Landing I expect her to fall or die in the flames in the moment she blows the place up.</p><p>I must admit that I would hate for Jon to kill her. I don\u2019t want him to become a kinslayer, and other than have Jon killing a woman when he shied from that when he met Ygritte, it doesn\u2019t serve any narrative purpose. Jon and D in a Targbowl has been set up, but Jon as killer not necesssarily. If Jon kills a woman it might be Cersei (although my pet theory is that it will be Bran via warging).</p><p>You can make a case for Arya though. We ladies at <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN2Tk4D3PoYooipN6QjDY2Q\">@delulumeta</a> are checking this theory and we have had some very interesting finds already (I posted one). I\u2019m more and more convinced that this will happen. I do think it would be satisfying for Arya\u2019s arc who wouldn\u2019t kill for revenge but for protection, but it would have to be tied with the hubris arc that is prevalent in D\u2019s story, and I\u2019m not yet sure, how these can be brought together in a satisfying way. I think it can be done, you can have D overreaching, having her moment of triumph and then Arya steps in to protect Jon and finishes her. <br/></p><p>GRRM usually manages to have an outcome that is satisfying for several arcs at once and since I think D is important (if an antagonist) I feel that her arc has to be interwoven with the arcs of the others. I think it is possible to do that, have her die of hubris and killed by Arya, but I\u2019m not yet sure how. <br/></p><p>For a very long time I\u2019ve believed that D would get a last minute saviour action, either from remorse after burning King\u2019s Landing or accidentally like Gollum - and her being an accidental saviour is something that is also very preeminent in her arc. But I\u2019m not that sure any more. GRRM might really go the whole way and have her die an unrepentent villain. <br/></p><p>So, in general I agree with you. Dying in childbirth would be just mehhhh. Very unsatisfactory. But to me the evidence for Arya killing D has set me thinking. It would be difficult to pull that of as satisfactory for D, not unmanagable though - but for Arya it is a very fitting scenario. Her arc which is so much about revenge and mercy and the boundaries that she\u2019ll have to set for herself, that I would really like her to kill not for revenge but for protection as an action that is not directed towards the past but towards the future of her cousin Jon.<br/></p><div><p>Thanks for the ask!<br/></p></div>",

I think it is possible to do that, have her die of hubris and killed by Arya, but I&rsquo;m not yet sure how. <br /></p><p>For a very long time I&rsquo;ve believed that D would get a last minute saviour action, either from remorse after burning King&rsquo;s Landing or accidentally like Gollum - and her being an accidental saviour is something that is also very preeminent in her arc. But I&rsquo;m not that sure any more. GRRM might really go the whole way and have her die an unrepentent villain. <br /></p><p>So, in general I agree with you. Dying in childbirth would be just mehhhh. Very unsatisfactory. But to me the evidence for Arya killing D has set me thinking. It would be difficult to pull that of as satisfactory for D, not unmanagable though - but for Arya it is a very fitting scenario. Her arc which is so much about revenge and mercy and the boundaries that she&rsquo;ll have to set for herself, that I would really like her to kill not for revenge but for protection as an action that is not directed towards the past but towards the future of her cousin Jon.<br /></p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br /></p>",
