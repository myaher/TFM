Anyone who met him at the Compound couldn\u2019t help but be taken in by the teenager\u2019s infectious energy. He talked a mile a minute and had to be reminded to slow down, but he was well-liked. But everyone felt like there was some shroud of secrecy around the teen.<br/></p><p>Tony had claimed that Peter was his intern. And something about Tony Stark didn\u2019t scream \u2018I need a personal intern\u2019. And he was a kid in high school. Couldn\u2019t Tony find an intern that was older?</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cMaybe Pepper made him do it?\u201d The group was sitting in the common room in the Compound. Clint was sitting on the floor, one leg stretched out with he held the other in a stretch. Nat was sitting on a chair, with Clint leaning back against the chair, his back occasionally bumping her leg, usually in a playful nature. Steve was standing behind the couch, his arms crossed over his chest. Sam and Wanda sat on the couch, a comfortable space between the two. Wanda was absent-mindedly braiding her hair. Everyone glanced at Steve who spoke. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Sam asked, glancing at Steve.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Steve said. \u201cTake a kid under his wing, mentor him. That kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony Stark doesn\u2019t seem like the mentoring children kind of guy,\u201d Wanda said. Nat sighed and gave Wanda a soft smile. She came back to the Compound because everyone else did. But that didn\u2019t mean the scars from her past didn\u2019t make that decision difficult.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s great with kids,\u201d Clint said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen him with Coop. He was great!\u201d A thought then clicked in Clint\u2019s head. \u201cWhat color are Peter\u2019s eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would we know that?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cBrown,\u201d Natasha said. Sam glanced at her and she shrugged noncommittally. She was a spy afterall. </p><p>\u201cAnd what color are Tony\u2019s eyes?\u201d Clint asked. Steve raised an eyebrow. What was Clint getting at?</p><p>\u201cBrown,\u201d Natasha answered again. Clint smirked wickedly. Oh yeah, it was all adding up to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the kid is his kid?\u201d Clint asked. Natasha rolled her eyes but Sam made a face that meant it wasn\u2019t unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cDude did have a scandalous past,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t open a newspaper in the 90\u2019s or early 2000\u2019s without hearing about Stark\u2019s partying ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard to knock someone up,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cYou would know,\u201d Natasha teased. </p><p>\u201cHey I\u2019m a married man,\u201d Clint countered back, nudging back into Natasha\u2019s leg. She smirked, but pushed him forwards with her foot. \u201cBut he could\u2019ve knocked someone up and then just kept the kid hidden from the press. He\u2019s got that kind of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t his old man the exact same way?\u201d Sam asked glancing back at Steve. Steve shrugged, grimacing a little thinking back to his \u2018fondue\u2019 conversation. God, Peggy should\u2019ve just punched him then and there.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it would make sense,\u201d Wanda said. \u201cHe\u2019s so nice to Peter. I heard him congratulating him on getting an A on a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him ruffle the kids\u2019 hair,\u201d Sam said. \u201cDefinitely something a dad would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys I vetted Tony years ago,\u201d Natasha pointed out. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve missed something that massive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but that was a decade ago Nat,\u201d Clint said. \u201cMaybe he found out after you vetted him.\u201d Natasha pursed her lips, not quite believing the story. \u201cSame hair color, same eye color, and look at how he treats him.\u201d Steve was about to say something when Tony walked into the common room, Peter with him. </p><p>\u201cWe have a Decathlon meet this weekend,\u201d Peter was saying as they walked in. \u201cIf we win, it could buy us a ticket back to Nationals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do great kid,\u201d Tony said, ruffling Peter\u2019s hair. Clint glanced at the others and mouthed \u2018total dad move\u2019 to which Sam nodded. \u201cAnd how about that Spanish test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tomorrow,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI\u2019ll study later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd risk your aunt\u2019s wrath when you fail?\u201d Tony questioned, still not noticing the others watching them. \u201cNo can do. You\u2019ll study now.\u201d Peter pouted but then noticed the others sitting by the couch.</p><p>\u201cHi everyone,\u201d Peter said waving at them. Tony barely glanced at them before going over to the fridge. </p><p>\u201cHey Peter,\u201d Clint said, a small smirk on his face. \u201cWhat are you guys up to?\u201d Peter crossed over to the couch.</p><p>\u201cMister Stark and I were working on the Iron Man armor,\u201d Peter said. Clint fought back the frown that threatened to form on his face. Why would Peter call Tony something so formal?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you call him that?\u201d Sam asked raising an eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cCall him what?\u201d Peter asked confused. </p><p>\u201cMister Stark,\u201d Sam said. </p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s his name?\u201d Peter asked, still confused. He didn\u2019t know them all too well, but the question was definitely weird.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there something less formal to call him?\u201d Clint asked. Natasha rolled her eyes. This was definitely not going where they wanted it to. Tony walked over and placed a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. He noticed the confused look on Peter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cBarton are you weirding out teenagers again?\u201d Tony asked, before looking back at Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to know why I call you Mister Stark,\u201d Peter said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s my name,\u201d Tony said. Clint snorted. They had answered the same! How could he be wrong about this? He looked at Clint. \u201cWhat should he call me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Clint said bluntly and Natasha smacked a hand across her face.

He noticed the confused look on Peter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cBarton are you weirding out teenagers again?\u201d Tony asked, before looking back at Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to know why I call you Mister Stark,\u201d Peter said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s my name,\u201d Tony said. Clint snorted. They had answered the same! How could he be wrong about this? He looked at Clint. \u201cWhat should he call me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Clint said bluntly and Natasha smacked a hand across her face. This was going to end bad.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d Tony sputtered staring at Clint in shock. Peter snorted and then covered his mouth. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt kind of is,\u201d Peter said, between giggles. Tony let out a frustrated noise and ran his hands down his face.</p><p>\u201cAnd what, pray tell, makes you think Peter is my son?\u201d Tony asked, a little exasperated. Steve kept his mouth shut. Clearly, this was not something he needed to butt in on. Natasha glanced over at Clint. This was his stupid idea anyways.</p><p>\u201cYou congratulated him for getting an A,\u201d Wanda offered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you always ruffle the kid\u2019s hair,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you kind of look alike,\u201d Clint said. Peter looked at Tony and laughed a little.</p><p>\u201cKid I swear to god,\u201d Tony grumbled and Peter just smirked. \u201cNo Clint, Peter is not my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Clint said, pointing at them. \u201cLook at you two! You basically act like father and son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Steve said. Tony sighed. Yeah he liked the kid. But he didn\u2019t treat Peter like his son. He glanced at Peter, who still had a smirk on his face. He was a good kid. Too good, sometimes.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are impossible,\u201d Tony said, shaking his head. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey I tried to convince them otherwise,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cBut Clint never listens to me. Not since Budapest.\u201d Clint rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my kid,\u201d Tony said. \u201cNow are you all done embarrassing yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve said. Wanda and Sam nodded, Wanda shooting an apologetic smile towards both of them. Tony looked at Clint who just shrugged. Tony rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon kid,\u201d Tony said. \u201cLet\u2019s go before this conversation makes me any dumber.\u201d Tony turned to walk away and Peter followed him.</p><p>\u201cI still think he\u2019s his dad,\u201d Clint grumbled, earning him a smack on the back head from Natasha. When the group was out of earshot, Peter turned towards Tony. </p><p>\u201cWeird that they thought you were my dad,\u201d Peter said. Tony shook his head and chuckled. </p><p>\u201cNo idea where they would have gotten that kiddo,\u201d Tony said, reaching over and ruffling Peter\u2019s hair. Peter smiled. Tony laughed and gripped Peter\u2019s shoulder tightly, giving him a sideways hug. Peter rolled his eyes but couldn\u2019t help but smile as well. Maybe having the Avengers think Peter was his son wasn\u2019t the end of the world. Besides, he was a good kid.</p><p>\u201cBesides you\u2019re less of a father figure and more of a bother figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the suit away again kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMister Stark!\u201d</p></p>",

Anyone who met him at the Compound couldn&rsquo;t help but be taken in by the teenager&rsquo;s infectious energy. He talked a mile a minute and had to be reminded to slow down, but he was well-liked. But everyone felt like there was some shroud of secrecy around the teen.<br /></p><p>Tony had claimed that Peter was his intern. And something about Tony Stark didn&rsquo;t scream &lsquo;I need a personal intern&rsquo;. And he was a kid in high school. Couldn&rsquo;t Tony find an intern that was older?</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe Pepper made him do it?&rdquo; The group was sitting in the common room in the Compound. Clint was sitting on the floor, one leg stretched out with he held the other in a stretch. Nat was sitting on a chair, with Clint leaning back against the chair, his back occasionally bumping her leg, usually in a playful nature. Steve was standing behind the couch, his arms crossed over his chest. Sam and Wanda sat on the couch, a comfortable space between the two. Wanda was absent-mindedly braiding her hair. Everyone glanced at Steve who spoke. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell are you talking about?&rdquo; Sam asked, glancing at Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;Take a kid under his wing, mentor him. That kind of stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony Stark doesn&rsquo;t seem like the mentoring children kind of guy,&rdquo; Wanda said. Nat sighed and gave Wanda a soft smile. She came back to the Compound because everyone else did. But that didn&rsquo;t mean the scars from her past didn&rsquo;t make that decision difficult.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s great with kids,&rdquo; Clint said. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve seen him with Coop. He was great!&rdquo; A thought then clicked in Clint&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;What color are Peter&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why the hell would we know that?&rdquo; Sam asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Brown,&rdquo; Natasha said. Sam glanced at her and she shrugged noncommittally. She was a spy afterall. </p><p>&ldquo;And what color are Tony&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo; Clint asked. Steve raised an eyebrow. What was Clint getting at?</p><p>&ldquo;Brown,&rdquo; Natasha answered again. Clint smirked wickedly. Oh yeah, it was all adding up to him.</p><p>&ldquo;What if the kid is his kid?&rdquo; Clint asked. Natasha rolled her eyes but Sam made a face that meant it wasn&rsquo;t unbelievable.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude did have a scandalous past,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t open a newspaper in the 90&rsquo;s or early 2000&rsquo;s without hearing about Stark&rsquo;s partying ways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that hard to knock someone up,&rdquo; Clint said.</p><p>&ldquo;You would know,&rdquo; Natasha teased. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m a married man,&rdquo; Clint countered back, nudging back into Natasha&rsquo;s leg. She smirked, but pushed him forwards with her foot. &ldquo;But he could&rsquo;ve knocked someone up and then just kept the kid hidden from the press. He&rsquo;s got that kind of money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Steve said.</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t his old man the exact same way?&rdquo; Sam asked glancing back at Steve. Steve shrugged, grimacing a little thinking back to his &lsquo;fondue&rsquo; conversation. God, Peggy should&rsquo;ve just punched him then and there.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose it would make sense,&rdquo; Wanda said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so nice to Peter. I heard him congratulating him on getting an A on a test.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I saw him ruffle the kids&rsquo; hair,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;Definitely something a dad would do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guys I vetted Tony years ago,&rdquo; Natasha pointed out. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I could&rsquo;ve missed something that massive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but that was a decade ago Nat,&rdquo; Clint said. &ldquo;Maybe he found out after you vetted him.&rdquo; Natasha pursed her lips, not quite believing the story. &ldquo;Same hair color, same eye color, and look at how he treats him.&rdquo; Steve was about to say something when Tony walked into the common room, Peter with him. </p><p>&ldquo;We have a Decathlon meet this weekend,&rdquo; Peter was saying as they walked in. &ldquo;If we win, it could buy us a ticket back to Nationals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do great kid,&rdquo; Tony said, ruffling Peter&rsquo;s hair. Clint glanced at the others and mouthed &lsquo;total dad move&rsquo; to which Sam nodded. &ldquo;And how about that Spanish test?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tomorrow,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll study later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And risk your aunt&rsquo;s wrath when you fail?&rdquo; Tony questioned, still not noticing the others watching them. &ldquo;No can do. You&rsquo;ll study now.&rdquo; Peter pouted but then noticed the others sitting by the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi everyone,&rdquo; Peter said waving at them. Tony barely glanced at them before going over to the fridge. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Peter,&rdquo; Clint said, a small smirk on his face. &ldquo;What are you guys up to?&rdquo; Peter crossed over to the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Mister Stark and I were working on the Iron Man armor,&rdquo; Peter said. Clint fought back the frown that threatened to form on his face. Why would Peter call Tony something so formal?</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you call him that?&rdquo; Sam asked raising an eyebrow. </p><p>&ldquo;Call him what?&rdquo; Peter asked confused. </p><p>&ldquo;Mister Stark,&rdquo; Sam said. </p><p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; Peter asked, still confused. He didn&rsquo;t know them all too well, but the question was definitely weird.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something less formal to call him?&rdquo; Clint asked. Natasha rolled her eyes. This was definitely not going where they wanted it to. Tony walked over and placed a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder.

Who the hell had trusted him to look after a kid? </p><p>The boy was\ncrouched on the floor next to the smithereens of what used to be a vase, his\npants drenched with the water that was pooling around him. The tulips his maid\nhad gotten just two days prior were strewn across the floor, a mess of pollen\nand petals and mushed leaves. </p><p>None of\nthat truly registered with Tony, though, because there was blood, too. Peter\u2019s\nhands were covered in blood where he was propped up on the floor from bracing\nhis fall. The shards were embedded in his skin and the older man\u2019s stomach\ncoiled at the sight. He had never had a problem seeing blood but apparently he\nhad very many problems seeing this particular kid\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so \u2013\nso s-sorry, Mister- Mister Sta-Stark, sir,\u201d the kid stuttered through trembling\nlips, glassy eyes still locked on Tony who was getting increasingly worried by\nthe second. \u201cI- I didn\u2019t- I didn\u2019t mean to b-break it. I \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he\nshushed, squatting down next to Peter, glad he was still wearing shoes when he\nheard the glass crunch under his soles. He reached out, mirroring his movements\nso he wouldn\u2019t scare the kid who looked more and more like a frightened animal.\nOnce he had a hold of the boy, he pulled him up with him and lead him a few\nsteps away. </p><p>An\nundertaking that was a lot easier said than done when you were trying to move a\nshell-shocked super-teen. </p><p>Gently he\npried Peter\u2019s hands from where he was grabbing the fabric of his pants and\ninspected the injury. The blood had certainly made it looked worse than it\nactually was but he doubted the shards in his hands were a lot of fun either\nway. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\nthat bad,\u201d he told the muted kid with an encouraging smile even though he still\nfelt sick just looking at the blood. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna pull them out and clean you\nup and with your super-healing you\u2019re going to be good as new in no time.\u201d </p><p>When there\nwas still no reply he started pulling him towards the kitchen and the first aid\nkid he stored there.

Protected me from his wrath more than once when <i>I</i> broke\nsomething of value. She did her best to drive him up the walls of our fancy\nmansion and she was the best at it. That\u2019s why she got him that vase for\nChristmas one year.\u201d</p><p> \u201cSorry, buddy,\u201d he grimaced when the boy\nwinced and a solitary tear slipped from the corner of his eye. \u201cWe\u2019re almost\ndone. Do you want me to stop talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh uh,\u201d\nhe shook his head, smiling bravely, bottom lip tugged between his teeth, \u201cI\nwanna know about the vase.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\nkiddie.\u201d He concentrated on plucking another shard from his right hand now before\ncontinuing. </p><p>\u201cHoward\nloved everything fancy,\u201d he explained, \u201cEverything was better when it cost a\nlot of money and things were only really worth having when they had a name\neveryone knew. The house I grew up in looked more like a museum than anything else\nand it was equally frightening to just walk through the rooms.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe also\nprided himself on looking like a good guy to the rest of the world.\u201d Key word\nbeing <i>look like</i>. \u201cSo when Peggy Carter, prominent agent and Co-founder\nof S.H.I.E.L.D. presented him with a cheap no-name vase during the annual\nChristmas gathering, basically in front of the whole world or at least in front\nof everyone who mattered, he had to accept her gift with a big smile and cheek\nkisses. He was livid.\u201d </p><p>Tony chuckled quietly, pulling out the last\npiece of ceramic and picking up the disinfection. </p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s gonna burn a bit but we don\u2019t want\nany dirt in there once it\u2019s closing,\u201d he warned, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d came the tight- lipped\nreply, \u201cWhy did your dad keep the vase if he didn\u2019t like it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, believe me he would have loved nothing\nmore than to throw it out,\u201d Tony said with a grin that turned into a sorry\ngrimace when Peter hissed. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s almost over.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe actually hid it in some secret chamber\nnever to be seen again until there was another function and Peggy openly\nlamented over how she had never actually seen the vase she had gotten him for\nChristmas and there were a lot of questions about why he wouldn\u2019t want to set\nit up where everyone could see it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, whether he liked it or not, Howard had the\nvase put up on a small table right at the entrance with the order to always\nkeep it clean and to always keep the flowers in it fresh. It was the first thing\nyou saw when you set foot into the mansion and it was a sign of Peggy\u2019s\nstubbornness and her love to defy the likes of men like Howard. It was the only\nthing I kept of Howard\u2019s.\u201d </p><p>Peter frowned at him, looking frustrated. \u201cSo\nthe vase <i>was</i> important to you even though it wasn\u2019t very expensive. I\u2019m <i>really</i>\nsorry Mister Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it\nwas,\u201d he agreed easily, reaching for the gauze to bandage the now clean wound,\n\u201cBut the thing Peggy taught me was that people are always more important than\nstuff no matter how valuable you think the stuff is. She took off her\nengagement ring because she accidentally cut my cheek with it one time. Said\nbeing engaged wasn\u2019t worth hurting me and started wearing it on a chain around\nher neck from then on.\u201d </p><p>He had\nfinished wrapping the kid\u2019s hands and pulled out a tissue to clean off the\nresidue blood from his wrists and face. </p><p>\u201cMy point\nis,\u201d he said, wiping at Peter\u2019s cheek until the red came off, grinning when the\nboy scrunched up his face in indignation, \u201cshe would\u2019ve banned all vases from\nthe house the second someone got hurt because of them. And, yeah, it was a nice\ntoken to remember my Aunt Peggy by but I\u2019d rather have you happy and healthy\nand tell you about her than some stupid old vase that she once touched.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Peter\ncocked his head to the side thoughtfully, \u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he\nshook his head and pushed himself back up, cringing when his joints creaked.\n\u201cYou know how much old people love telling stories. And I got to tell one of my\nfavorite stories about Peggy Carter so really I\u2019m glad you broke it. Not so\nglad you got hurt, though.\u201d</p><p>The kid\ngrinned happily, jumping up from the chair, tears and broken vase forgotten.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d he agreed with a laugh and then, a little more hesitantly asked,\n\u201cDo you want to tell me more about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore\nstories about Aunt Peggy? Gladly, buddy.\u201d </p>",

It\u2019s going to sting a bit but we don\u2019t want\nanything stuck in there when you start healing, alright?\u201d </p><p>When the\nkid didn\u2019t reply and simply kept staring he squeezed his knee with his free\nhand and repeated. \u201cIs that okay, kid?\u201d Only when he got a shaky nod in return\ndid he start to pull out the pieces one by one. </p><p>Peter\nwinced but otherwise didn\u2019t show any sign of pain which made the whole\nprocedure a lot more bearable for Tony who felt a stab through his own skin\nwith every piece he cleaned. </p><p>\u201cYou told\nme it was a gift from your Aunt Peggy.\u201d His voice was barely more than a\nwhisper and immediately after the words left his mouth he bit his trembling lip,\nobviously still forcing back a sob. \u201cAnd- and I- I bro-broke it.\u201d </p><p>He was\nshaking at that point, tears leaking from his eyes and mixing with the dried\nblood on his cheek from where he had tried to wipe his eyes with his hands\nearlier. \u201cI\u2019m so \u2013 sorry, Mister Stark.\u201d </p><p>Tony\nshushed him again, surprised how paternal the sound made him feel, how he\ninstinctually reached out to brush the tears away and lowered the tweezers to\nconcentrate on the kid\u2019s distress instead. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\ncare about you breaking the vase.\u201d And, surprisingly, he didn\u2019t. Yes, it had\nbeen a gift from Peggy Carter but that was so far down on his lists of\npriorities right now, it didn\u2019t even make the first page. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going\nto tell you a story about my Aunt Peggy and that vase,\u201d he decided, settling\nhis hand on Peter\u2019s knee again and waiting until he met his eyes again. \u201cBut\nfirst you\u2019re going to tell me whether you\u2019re crying over that vase or because\nyou\u2019re in pain. Because you are allowed to cry when you\u2019re in pain but you\u2019re\nnot allowed to cry over a stupid vase.\u201d </p><p>That\nmanaged to tickle a giggle out of the boy and albeit wet and shaky it was music\nin Tony\u2019s ears. \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt too bad,\u201d he sniveled, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t wanna make\nyou sad.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen let\nme get out these shards while telling you about my favorite aunt and I\u2019ll be\nthe happiest. Deal?\u201d </p><p>Peter\nnodded and Tony went back to work. </p><p>\u201cAunt Peggy\nwas my godmother,\u201d he began, \u201cit was my dad\u2019s idea. I think he wanted to have\npeople around his firstborn son who loved Steve Rogers as much as he did and\nwho wouldn\u2019t let him forget his biggest creation. It was,\u201d he swallowed, \u201chard\nsometimes to grow up with a dad who was always looking for more than you could\ngive him but Aunt Peggy wasn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d </p><p>A smile\nstretched across his face remembering the fierce redhead who had never minced\nher words, especially not for Howard Stark. </p><p>\u201cPeggy\nloved me a lot.\u201d It was one of the few things he was truly certain of. \u201cAnd I\nthink he hadn\u2019t planned for that. For her actually wanting to spend time with\nme and not comparing me to a dead super soldier and their relationship went\ndownhill from there.\u201d An understatement if he\u2019d ever heard one.</p><p>\u201cPeggy\ndidn\u2019t like the way Howard acted and how he treated me, so she told him as much.\nFrequently. Protected me from his wrath more than once when <i>I</i> broke\nsomething of value. She did her best to drive him up the walls of our fancy\nmansion and she was the best at it. That\u2019s why she got him that vase for\nChristmas one year.\u201d</p><p> \u201cSorry, buddy,\u201d he grimaced when the boy\nwinced and a solitary tear slipped from the corner of his eye. \u201cWe\u2019re almost\ndone. Do you want me to stop talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh uh,\u201d\nhe shook his head, smiling bravely, bottom lip tugged between his teeth, \u201cI\nwanna know about the vase.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\nkiddie.\u201d He concentrated on plucking another shard from his right hand now before\ncontinuing. </p><p>\u201cHoward\nloved everything fancy,\u201d he explained, \u201cEverything was better when it cost a\nlot of money and things were only really worth having when they had a name\neveryone knew. The house I grew up in looked more like a museum than anything else\nand it was equally frightening to just walk through the rooms.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe also\nprided himself on looking like a good guy to the rest of the world.\u201d Key word\nbeing <i>look like</i>. \u201cSo when Peggy Carter, prominent agent and Co-founder\nof S.H.I.E.L.D. presented him with a cheap no-name vase during the annual\nChristmas gathering, basically in front of the whole world or at least in front\nof everyone who mattered, he had to accept her gift with a big smile and cheek\nkisses. He was livid.\u201d </p><p>Tony chuckled quietly, pulling out the last\npiece of ceramic and picking up the disinfection. </p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s gonna burn a bit but we don\u2019t want\nany dirt in there once it\u2019s closing,\u201d he warned, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d came the tight- lipped\nreply, \u201cWhy did your dad keep the vase if he didn\u2019t like it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, believe me he would have loved nothing\nmore than to throw it out,\u201d Tony said with a grin that turned into a sorry\ngrimace when Peter hissed. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s almost over.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe actually hid it in some secret chamber\nnever to be seen again until there was another function and Peggy openly\nlamented over how she had never actually seen the vase she had gotten him for\nChristmas and there were a lot of questions about why he wouldn\u2019t want to set\nit up where everyone could see it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, whether he liked it or not, Howard had the\nvase put up on a small table right at the entrance with the order to always\nkeep it clean and to always keep the flowers in it fresh. It was the first thing\nyou saw when you set foot into the mansion and it was a sign of Peggy\u2019s\nstubbornness and her love to defy the likes of men like Howard. It was the only\nthing I kept of Howard\u2019s.\u201d </p><p>Peter frowned at him, looking frustrated. \u201cSo\nthe vase <i>was</i> important to you even though it wasn\u2019t very expensive. I\u2019m <i>really</i>\nsorry Mister Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it\nwas,\u201d he agreed easily, reaching for the gauze to bandage the now clean wound,\n\u201cBut the thing Peggy taught me was that people are always more important than\nstuff no matter how valuable you think the stuff is. She took off her\nengagement ring because she accidentally cut my cheek with it one time. Said\nbeing engaged wasn\u2019t worth hurting me and started wearing it on a chain around\nher neck from then on.\u201d </p><p>He had\nfinished wrapping the kid\u2019s hands and pulled out a tissue to clean off the\nresidue blood from his wrists and face. </p><p>\u201cMy point\nis,\u201d he said, wiping at Peter\u2019s cheek until the red came off, grinning when the\nboy scrunched up his face in indignation, \u201cshe would\u2019ve banned all vases from\nthe house the second someone got hurt because of them.

And I got to tell one of my\nfavorite stories about Peggy Carter so really I\u2019m glad you broke it.

Protected me from his wrath more than once when <i>I</i> broke\nsomething of value. She did her best to drive him up the walls of our fancy\nmansion and she was the best at it. That&rsquo;s why she got him that vase for\nChristmas one year.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Sorry, buddy,&rdquo; he grimaced when the boy\nwinced and a solitary tear slipped from the corner of his eye. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost\ndone. Do you want me to stop talking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nuh uh,&rdquo;\nhe shook his head, smiling bravely, bottom lip tugged between his teeth, &ldquo;I\nwanna know about the vase.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\nkiddie.&rdquo; He concentrated on plucking another shard from his right hand now before\ncontinuing. </p><p>&ldquo;Howard\nloved everything fancy,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;Everything was better when it cost a\nlot of money and things were only really worth having when they had a name\neveryone knew. The house I grew up in looked more like a museum than anything else\nand it was equally frightening to just walk through the rooms.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He also\nprided himself on looking like a good guy to the rest of the world.&rdquo; Key word\nbeing <i>look like</i>. &ldquo;So when Peggy Carter, prominent agent and Co-founder\nof S.H.I.E.L.D. presented him with a cheap no-name vase during the annual\nChristmas gathering, basically in front of the whole world or at least in front\nof everyone who mattered, he had to accept her gift with a big smile and cheek\nkisses. He was livid.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony chuckled quietly, pulling out the last\npiece of ceramic and picking up the disinfection. </p><p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s gonna burn a bit but we don&rsquo;t want\nany dirt in there once it&rsquo;s closing,&rdquo; he warned, &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ll ever be,&rdquo; came the tight- lipped\nreply, &ldquo;Why did your dad keep the vase if he didn&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, believe me he would have loved nothing\nmore than to throw it out,&rdquo; Tony said with a grin that turned into a sorry\ngrimace when Peter hissed. &ldquo;Sorry. It&rsquo;s almost over.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He actually hid it in some secret chamber\nnever to be seen again until there was another function and Peggy openly\nlamented over how she had never actually seen the vase she had gotten him for\nChristmas and there were a lot of questions about why he wouldn&rsquo;t want to set\nit up where everyone could see it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So, whether he liked it or not, Howard had the\nvase put up on a small table right at the entrance with the order to always\nkeep it clean and to always keep the flowers in it fresh. It was the first thing\nyou saw when you set foot into the mansion and it was a sign of Peggy&rsquo;s\nstubbornness and her love to defy the likes of men like Howard. It was the only\nthing I kept of Howard&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter frowned at him, looking frustrated. &ldquo;So\nthe vase <i>was</i> important to you even though it wasn&rsquo;t very expensive. I&rsquo;m <i>really</i>\nsorry Mister Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure it\nwas,&rdquo; he agreed easily, reaching for the gauze to bandage the now clean wound,\n&ldquo;But the thing Peggy taught me was that people are always more important than\nstuff no matter how valuable you think the stuff is. She took off her\nengagement ring because she accidentally cut my cheek with it one time. Said\nbeing engaged wasn&rsquo;t worth hurting me and started wearing it on a chain around\nher neck from then on.&rdquo; </p><p>He had\nfinished wrapping the kid&rsquo;s hands and pulled out a tissue to clean off the\nresidue blood from his wrists and face. </p><p>&ldquo;My point\nis,&rdquo; he said, wiping at Peter&rsquo;s cheek until the red came off, grinning when the\nboy scrunched up his face in indignation, &ldquo;she would&rsquo;ve banned all vases from\nthe house the second someone got hurt because of them. And, yeah, it was a nice\ntoken to remember my Aunt Peggy by but I&rsquo;d rather have you happy and healthy\nand tell you about her than some stupid old vase that she once touched.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Peter\ncocked his head to the side thoughtfully, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he\nshook his head and pushed himself back up, cringing when his joints creaked.\n&ldquo;You know how much old people love telling stories. And I got to tell one of my\nfavorite stories about Peggy Carter so really I&rsquo;m glad you broke it. Not so\nglad you got hurt, though.&rdquo;</p><p>The kid\ngrinned happily, jumping up from the chair, tears and broken vase forgotten.\n&ldquo;You are old,&rdquo; he agreed with a laugh and then, a little more hesitantly asked,\n&ldquo;Do you want to tell me more about her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More\nstories about Aunt Peggy? Gladly, buddy.&rdquo; </p>",

Who the hell had trusted him to look after a kid? </p>\n<p>The boy was\ncrouched on the floor next to the smithereens of what used to be a vase, his\npants drenched with the water that was pooling around him. The tulips his maid\nhad gotten just two days prior were strewn across the floor, a mess of pollen\nand petals and mushed leaves. </p>\n<p>None of\nthat truly registered with Tony, though, because there was blood, too. Peter&rsquo;s\nhands were covered in blood where he was propped up on the floor from bracing\nhis fall. The shards were embedded in his skin and the older man&rsquo;s stomach\ncoiled at the sight. He had never had a problem seeing blood but apparently he\nhad very many problems seeing this particular kid&rsquo;s blood.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so &ndash;\nso s-sorry, Mister- Mister Sta-Stark, sir,&rdquo; the kid stuttered through trembling\nlips, glassy eyes still locked on Tony who was getting increasingly worried by\nthe second. &ldquo;I- I didn&rsquo;t- I didn&rsquo;t mean to b-break it. I &ndash;&ldquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; he\nshushed, squatting down next to Peter, glad he was still wearing shoes when he\nheard the glass crunch under his soles. He reached out, mirroring his movements\nso he wouldn&rsquo;t scare the kid who looked more and more like a frightened animal.\nOnce he had a hold of the boy, he pulled him up with him and lead him a few\nsteps away. </p>\n<p>An\nundertaking that was a lot easier said than done when you were trying to move a\nshell-shocked super-teen. </p>\n<p>Gently he\npried Peter&rsquo;s hands from where he was grabbing the fabric of his pants and\ninspected the injury. The blood had certainly made it looked worse than it\nactually was but he doubted the shards in his hands were a lot of fun either\nway. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not\nthat bad,&rdquo; he told the muted kid with an encouraging smile even though he still\nfelt sick just looking at the blood. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna pull them out and clean you\nup and with your super-healing you&rsquo;re going to be good as new in no time.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>When there\nwas still no reply he started pulling him towards the kitchen and the first aid\nkid he stored there. Peter followed without problem, stumbling a little when\nthey came to the halt but never actually making a sound. It was the longest he\nhad ever gone without at least making some kind of noise ever since Tony had\nmet him. He couldn&rsquo;t help but worry the longer it went on.</p>\n<p>Only when\nhe had manhandled the kid into a chair and made sure he wasn&rsquo;t going to slip\nout of it before getting a pair of tweezers and some disinfection to clean the\nwound, did the kid open his mouth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;B-but what\nabout the vase.&rdquo; </p>\n</p>",

                "content": "<p>Ok but imagine this: Tony has the super soldier seurum. It was injected in his bloodstream while his mom was pregnant. Because of this, the changes that happened to him were a lot different than the ones that happened to Captain America, he ages a bit slower, sure, but he&rsquo;s not <i>that</i> strong (Rhodey opens the pickle jars). His sperm though, pretty potent. </p><p>And so one night while the other Avengers are asleep, they get really drunk on his workshop. Natasha tells him she can&rsquo;t have kids even thought she really wants them, because her body kills any sperm that enters it. Tony tells her he literally has super sperm which could probably bypass that. And just like that they have an idea.</p><p>The next morning they wake up in bed together, in a cozy (a.k.a tiny) apartment. They have no idea what happened the night before, where they are, or how they got there in the first place.  </p><p>Nat starts exploring the place and Tony goes to the bathroom to freshen up, and when he looks at the trash can he notices that <i>there is no condom</i>. Which means they probably didn&rsquo;t use one.  </p><p>He goes back to the room and Natasha shows up and tells him they&rsquo;re in Queens. They talk about the previous night and decide that they need some time to rethink their relationship and how they see it. </p><p>Anyways, four weeks later she starts feeling sick when she wakes up. But she can&rsquo;t be pregnant, that&rsquo;s ridiculous. So time passes and she keeps quiet about it. She tries changing her diet (doesn&rsquo;t work), adding more time to her yoga routine (doesn&rsquo;t work either), taking three times the amount of days off she took in her entire lifetime in the span of four months, but nothing works.</p><p>And then she felt it. Something was wrong with her body, seriously wrong. So she rushed to SHIELD and asked Coulson if she could do a full medical checkup, that way it&rsquo;d be kept under the wraps.</p><p>The doctor tells her there is nothing wrong with her body, her baby kicking is just a sign of a perfectly healthy kid. She almost broke the woman&rsquo;s neck. I mean, she doesn&rsquo;t know why, but she did gain some weight lately, not enough to people think that she&rsquo;s pregnant thought. Helen Cho got scared by her tone, but said that she can prove Natasha is indeed pregnant. Nat&rsquo;s reluctant but she does the ultrasound anyway. And surprise surprise, she&rsquo;s having a baby.</p><p>Suddenly, the memories from that night came back to her.
