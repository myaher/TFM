Hope you like it as much as you liked the first part xx</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me again.\u201d\r</i></p><p>It was probably the 12th time or maybe 15th time that he pressed his phone to his ears just to have a conversation with particularly no one. There were no answers to the questions he asked; there were no giggles to the jokes he said; there were no thoughtful replies to any comments he made and there were no \u2018I love you too\u2019s to the \u2018i love you\u2019s he said. There was particularly nothing. Not even a deep breath; not even a sigh; not even a sign that someone, maybe someone in this whole entire world was listening to him. It was just a void nothing else. A cold - bitter void. But, that is what he deserved, didn\u2019t he? <i>Cold and the feeling of emptiness.\r</i></p><p>It wasn\u2019t the freezing weather that made him feel cold. Nor was it the big yet empty house he was living in made him feel empty. No it was her. <i>It was her along</i>. Not having her in the house made him feel empty; not having her by her side made him feel empty; not having her things in his house made him feel empty; not having the feeling of her walking around in the house made him feel empty; <i>not having her</i> made him feel empty. And not having her body, her warmth made him feel cold; not having her giggles and warm smiles made him feel cold; not having her warm kisses made him feel cold and <i>not having her</i> made him feel cold. <i>It was her all along.\r</i></p><p>But it was because of him that she wasn\u2019t around and it was because of him that he was in that position; that <i>they</i> were in that position.\r</p><p>Harry knew he ruined it all, he ruined the most beautiful thing he had.\r</p><p>Harry yet quite didn\u2019t know why he had done it. It was- it was just a feeling maybe- it was just a thought of not loving her anymore. He didn\u2019t know where it came from. He didn\u2019t know why it came. It just came and he still regret for even believing that mere thought. And he regret more for not talking it out with her. And he regret it more that he went outside to find love when his love was there at home.\r</p><p>There was no other thing that he regret more than that.\r</p><p><i>\u201cI hope you\u2019re doing great, hope you\u2019re taking care of yourself.\u201d\r</i></p><p>There was a ring resting on his palm. It wasn\u2019t his though - too small for him but perfect for her. He still remember how he had measured her finger when she was soundly sleeping (which he later realized that he didn\u2019t have to do, rather he could easily take one of her rings for measurement); he still remember how he went to this famous jeweler to custom make it and he still remember the day he had put it through her finger. He had never been that happy- but then he had to ruin it all.\r</p><p>He had sent the ring to her when her brother had come over to take her things. But, two days later it was sent back to him wrapped in a small brown box with a note that it didn\u2019t belong to her and he knew exactly what she meant.\r</p><p>He still remembered vividly the day she left. And still remembered the words she spoke before leaving - <i>\u201cWhy not give it to your new humming bird?\u201d\r</i></p><p>It had been replaying in his mind since then, haunting him every moment of his life since then. He didn\u2019t know why he called anyone but her humming bird, hell he didn\u2019t know why he even went to anyone other than her for love. He knew nothing. But the only thing he knew that he regret it so damn much.\r</p><p>He could never find a new humming bird. Nothing and none could replace her.\r</p><p><i>\u201cI saw your picture the other day -with him. You look happy.\u201d\r</i></p><p>She did. Her smile was bright  and wide. There were crinkles next her eyes. No sign of tiredness or gloominess like that night or any other pictures she posted afterwards.\r</p><p>If Harry was honest it did hurt him. Seeing her that happy with someone other than him, hurt him. But, seeing her happy - after almost a year made him feel some what good. <i>At least,</i> she wasn\u2019t still hurting for what he did.\r</p><p>But, deep down he still did want her to think about him and all the good times they had together. And, maybe just maybe he\u2019d be able to win her back.\r</p><p>But, it was too late. She had moved on leaving him in a dark pit that he didn\u2019t know how to get out of.\r</p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, why I\u2019m calling you again, hell I don\u2019t even know if you are getting them- but just wanted to say I still love you.\u201d\r</i></p><p>This was the first time that his voice broke and that tears finally ran down his cheeks. \r</p><p>He still loved her. And he knew he\u2019d be loving her until he died. There was no denying to that. But only if, only if he hadn\u2019t done what he had done then maybe he\u2019d have her with him until he died.\r</p><p>He really did dream of having a family with her; have children together; bring them up together; growing old together. <i>Together</i>.\r</p><p>That is what he wanted. <i>To be together.\r</i></p><p>But, it wasn\u2019t possible, not anymore. Harry didn\u2019t know how many times he wished to go back to the time when he first met Lana, the girl he thought he was in love with. He just wanted smack himself in the head before telling her to go back to Y/N, tell him that she wouldn\u2019t put up with his shit and that she\u2019d leave him.

There were no answers to the questions he asked; there were no giggles to the jokes he said; there were no thoughtful replies to any comments he made and there were no \u2018I love you too\u2019s to the \u2018i love you\u2019s he said. There was particularly nothing. Not even a deep breath; not even a sigh; not even a sign that someone, maybe someone in this whole entire world was listening to him. It was just a void nothing else. A cold - bitter void. But, that is what he deserved, didn\u2019t he? <i>Cold and the feeling of emptiness.\r</i></p><p>It wasn\u2019t the freezing weather that made him feel cold. Nor was it the big yet empty house he was living in made him feel empty. No it was her. <i>It was her along</i>. Not having her in the house made him feel empty; not having her by her side made him feel empty; not having her things in his house made him feel empty; not having the feeling of her walking around in the house made him feel empty; <i>not having her</i> made him feel empty. And not having her body, her warmth made him feel cold; not having her giggles and warm smiles made him feel cold; not having her warm kisses made him feel cold and <i>not having her</i> made him feel cold. <i>It was her all along.\r</i></p><p>But it was because of him that she wasn\u2019t around and it was because of him that he was in that position; that <i>they</i> were in that position.\r</p><p>Harry knew he ruined it all, he ruined the most beautiful thing he had.\r</p><p>Harry yet quite didn\u2019t know why he had done it. It was- it was just a feeling maybe- it was just a thought of not loving her anymore. He didn\u2019t know where it came from. He didn\u2019t know why it came. It just came and he still regret for even believing that mere thought. And he regret more for not talking it out with her. And he regret it more that he went outside to find love when his love was there at home.\r</p><p>There was no other thing that he regret more than that.\r</p><p><i>\u201cI hope you\u2019re doing great, hope you\u2019re taking care of yourself.\u201d\r</i></p><p>There was a ring resting on his palm. It wasn\u2019t his though - too small for him but perfect for her. He still remember how he had measured her finger when she was soundly sleeping (which he later realized that he didn\u2019t have to do, rather he could easily take one of her rings for measurement); he still remember how he went to this famous jeweler to custom make it and he still remember the day he had put it through her finger. He had never been that happy- but then he had to ruin it all.\r</p><p>He had sent the ring to her when her brother had come over to take her things. But, two days later it was sent back to him wrapped in a small brown box with a note that it didn\u2019t belong to her and he knew exactly what she meant.\r</p><p>He still remembered vividly the day she left. And still remembered the words she spoke before leaving - <i>\u201cWhy not give it to your new humming bird?\u201d\r</i></p><p>It had been replaying in his mind since then, haunting him every moment of his life since then. He didn\u2019t know why he called anyone but her humming bird, hell he didn\u2019t know why he even went to anyone other than her for love. He knew nothing. But the only thing he knew that he regret it so damn much.\r</p><p>He could never find a new humming bird. Nothing and none could replace her.\r</p><p><i>\u201cI saw your picture the other day -with him. You look happy.\u201d\r</i></p><p>She did. Her smile was bright  and wide. There were crinkles next her eyes. No sign of tiredness or gloominess like that night or any other pictures she posted afterwards.\r</p><p>If Harry was honest it did hurt him. Seeing her that happy with someone other than him, hurt him. But, seeing her happy - after almost a year made him feel some what good. <i>At least,</i> she wasn\u2019t still hurting for what he did.\r</p><p>But, deep down he still did want her to think about him and all the good times they had together. And, maybe just maybe he\u2019d be able to win her back.\r</p><p>But, it was too late. She had moved on leaving him in a dark pit that he didn\u2019t know how to get out of.\r</p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, why I\u2019m calling you again, hell I don\u2019t even know if you are getting them- but just wanted to say I still love you.\u201d\r</i></p><p>This was the first time that his voice broke and that tears finally ran down his cheeks. \r</p><p>He still loved her.

But only if, only if he hadn\u2019t done what he had done then maybe he\u2019d have her with him until he died.\r</p><p>He really did dream of having a family with her; have children together; bring them up together; growing old together. <i>Together</i>.\r</p><p>That is what he wanted. <i>To be together.\r</i></p><p>But, it wasn\u2019t possible, not anymore. Harry didn\u2019t know how many times he wished to go back to the time when he first met Lana, the girl he thought he was in love with.

He wanted to tell himself that no one could love him like Y/N did and he couldn&rsquo;t love anyone like he loved her.\r</p><p><i>&ldquo;It hurts to see you with someone else. But, I&rsquo;m happy that you are happy. I missed that smile of yours.&rdquo;\r</i></p><p>Harry let out a shaky breath. He really hoped that she got all his voice mails; that she listened to everything he had to say; that she listened to all of his cries as he begged for her forgiveness; that she realized how pathetic and broken he was; that she realized he truly regret what he had done.\r</p><p>Now after a year Harry didn&rsquo;t expect her to come back to him, even though he prayed almost every night that she&rsquo;d find a way to forgive him and come back to him. But he knew that won&rsquo;t happen. Y/N would never come back to someone who treated her like that; she knew what she was worth and he was proud of her for that. But still, he hoped and prayed maybe she&rsquo;d give him another chance, just one other.\r</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hope he makes you happy.&rdquo;\r</i></p><p>Another tear ran down his face as he looked up at the ceiling, clasping the ring tight in his hand.\r</p><p><i>&ldquo;I really hope he makes you happy.&rdquo;\r</i></p><p>He let out a sniffle. His voice breaking, eyes getting red.\r</p><p><i>&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t hurt you like I did. But I&rsquo;m just so fucking sorry.&rdquo;\r</i></p><p>Harry completely broke down then. Tears uncontrollably rolling down his cheeks and falling on the floor.\r</p><p><i>&ldquo;So fucking sorry for what I did. I know you won&rsquo;t ever comeback to me. But just want you to know I&rsquo;m sorry and I love you so fucking much.&rdquo;\r</i></p><p>He was looking at her ring again. Remembering all the happy times. All of those memories almost looked like old tapes playing; tapes he had played so many times; tapes he&rsquo;d be playing for the rest of his life. But, won&rsquo;t be able to live them ever again. \r</p><p><i>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ever stop loving you.&rdquo;</i></p>",

Instead, she drove him to the nearest hotel and even helped him to his room. She felt as if she were losing her mind. Never had she gone to such great lengths to help out any of her customers before.</p><p>&lsquo;What could have been so different about this man?&rsquo; She wondered, as she helped him through his hotel door.</p><p>Harry was almost completely out of it, by the time his head hit the pillow. Shaking her head, she removed his shoes and covered him up. After much consideration, she decided to leave him a note explaining things.</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Harry,</i></p><p><i>You were rather out of it, when I finally got you to your hotel room.</i></p><p><i>I didn&rsquo;t think you would remember so I just wanted to let you know that your keys are with the valet. I also made a request on your behalf to room service.</i></p><p><i>Someone should be along in the morning with some orange juice and Advil for the hangover you&rsquo;re sure to have.</i></p><p><i>Felicity</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>After another moment of deliberation, she added- bartender at Hope&rsquo;s Bar by her name. Harry had been so completely out of it that she doubted he would remember anything that had happened that night much less her name.</p><p>Looking at his sleeping form one last time, she sighed. He looked rather peaceful in this state of mind. You could hardly tell he was the same heartbroken mess she had spent the better part of her night with.</p><p>She fought the urge to reach out and swipe the hair away that had fallen into his eyes. Instead, she took a deep breath and turned around. Her emotions had been all over the place, and she couldn&rsquo;t explain why.</p><p>She made her way out of the hotel and into the cool night sky. Looking at her phone, she noticed it was already almost 3 in the morning. She was beyond exhausted and couldn&rsquo;t wait to get home. She was in desperate need of a hot shower.</p><p>She walked the two long blocks to her small apartment complex. Her neighborhood wasn&rsquo;t the grandest nor was it the safest. Hurriedly, she opened her door and rushed in. Quickly, she shut the door back and made sure all four locks were secured.</p><p>Setting all her things down, she let out a long breath. Her muscles were aching and her body felt heavy. Starting the shower, she got her clothes ready. She felt relieved as soon as the hot cascading water hit her aching body. Spending more time than usual under the steaming flow she began to relax.</p><p>After much time, she reluctantly turned off the stream and got out. Tiredly she slowly dried off and put her clean pajamas on. She was way to exhausted to worry about making herself something to eat. Instead, she climbed into her big comfy bed and relaxed under the covers. She was fast asleep, as soon as her head hit the pillows.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>*******************************************</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Harry&rsquo;s POV</b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Harry awoke with a massive headache. Looking around, he took in the room. He wasn\u2019t quite sure on where he was or how he had gotten there. His head was fuzzy and he felt sick to his stomach. He had definitely drunk to much last night.<br/><br/>He could vaguely remember being at the bar and talking with one of the bartenders. Bits and pieces of their conversation started to come back to him.<br/><br/>He could feel his phone buzzing in his pocket. Fumbling for it, he was finally able to retrieve it. Squinting, he took a look at the bright screen.<br/><br/>Courtney\u2019s picture flashed across the screen and Harry groaned. \u201cWonderful,\u201d he said out loud.<br/><br/>Hitting decline, he switched his phone off. Looking around the small hotel room he noticed a note on the nightstand. Sitting up slowly, he grabbed it. He read over it carefully.<br/><br/>\u2018Felicity,\u2019 he thought. The name sounded oddly familiar. A flash of her face came flooding into his mind.<br/><br/>His could remember his first thought of her, as he watched her behind the bar. He thought she was rather beautiful, even in her understated attire. He could remember watching her for a while, not entirely sure as to why. She seemed to take his mind off of Courtney and her betrayal, if only for a minute.<br/><br/>He read over her note once more. Her thoughtfulness made him smile. Not many people would take time out of their day to care for a stranger the way that she had done.<br/><br/>He took a look at the clock on the table, it was just past 9 in the morning. A knock on hotel room door brought him back to reality.<br/><br/>Groaning, he slowly got out of bed. Looking down, he noticed he was still in the same clothes he was wearing the day before. They were wrinkled and smelled of pure alcohol. He turned his nose up in disgust, as he stumbled to the door.<br/><br/>He opened the door to a man in formal attire. He was holding a tray in front of him and had a big smile on his face.<br/><br/>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said cheerfully. He held out the tray he was holding for Harry to take.<br/><br/>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told the man politely.<br/><br/>\u201cHave a good one!\u201d He called out, turning around and heading down the hall.<br/><br/>Harry took the tray inside his room and shut the door back. Taking a look, he saw a cup of orange juice. Along with the juice was a plate of food and two pills on the side.<br/><br/>Harry shook his head and smiled slightly to himself. He still could not believe how thoughtful and caring Felicity was. He was in utter awe.<br/><br/>Downing the pills, he chugged the juice. He was feeling a bit better already. Although his stomach was still turning, he forced himself to eat some of the eggs and toast on his plate.<br/><br/>Laying back in the bed, he contemplated his life and what had happened in the last 24 hours.<br/><br/>As hard as he tried, he could not get the imagine of Courtney and Mark together out of his head. It seemed to be on a never ending loop, playing in his brain. He wanted to rid himself of the torturous imagine, but he was not sure of how to do it.<br/><br/>He had thought that drowning himself in alcohol would have been the trick, however, it didn\u2019t seem to help all to much. Although, it did seem to numb him enough to where he didn\u2019t feel the pain quite as bad.<br/><br/>Giving it some though, he decided to send some flowers to the bar. It was the least he could do to thank Felicity for the kindness she had shown him.<br/><br/>Reluctantly he gathered his few belongings and headed out of the hotel. The sun was extremely bright and hurt his already pounding head even more.<br/><br/>He waited for the valet to bring his car around and tipped him once he did. Harry knee what he had to do, although every bone in his body opposed the idea.<br/><br/>He headed back to his home. Up until yesterday, he had always been rather fond of this house. Now, he couldn\u2019t stand to even look at it.<br/><br/>Quickly, he enter the house in his and raced to his room. Without so much as a glance at his bed, he headed to his closet. Grabbing a duffel bag, he pack him some extra clothes in it.<br/><br/>Although he hated being in this house any longer than he had to, he decided to take a quick shower and put on fresh clothing. He had never been one to be able to go without bathing. He couldn\u2019t stand being dirty nor did he enjoy reeking.<br/><br/>He was in and out of the house in record time. He had spent less than an hour getting together his essential ideas and taking a fast shower.<br/><br/>Taking one final look at the house, he thought of a plan. Although the idea might seem insane to others, he decided he would put this house up for sale. He knew that he would never be able to sleep in that bed again. Nor would he ever be able to enter the house without picturing his ex and her lover naked.<br/><br/>As he got back into his car, he grabbed his phone and called his realtor. He explained his situation in a rush and informed the man of what he wanted.<br/><br/>Larry has been more than eager to help. He could smell a quick and rather expensive sale headed his way. Thanking him, Harry had to make one more call.<br/><br/>Calling a local locksmith, he made arrangements to have his locks to the house replace. He informed the man that he would have his assistant drop buy with the keys. He wanted this done as soon as possible, in order to keep Courtney out of the house entirely.<br/><br/>Feeling a little better now that he had things squared away, Harry switched his phone back off. He knew that Courtney would continue to harass him, and he would rather not deal with her. She had never been one to give up, when it came to something she wanted. It was something that he had once admired her for.<br/><br/>Putting his car into drive he headed in the direction of the bar. It was only a little past 1 now, but he didn\u2019t care. He needed a drink to numb the pain. He still felt like his heart had been ripped from his chest.<br/><br/>Pulling up outside of Hope\u2019s, he took in a deep breath. He wondered if Felicity would be working today, part of him really hoped that she was.<br/><br/>Walking into the dimly lit bar, he took a look around. To his utter disappointment, she was no where in site. Sighing he walked to the back of the room and took a seat in the corner booth.<br/><br/>Ordering his drink of choice, whiskey, he leaned back in the booth and closed his eyes.<br/><br/>\u201cFelicity!! Thank God!!\u201d He heard, causing his head to snap up.<br/><br/>Walking through the glass doors, she smiled brightly at the girl behind the counter. Through sober eyes, she looked even more radiate then Harry could remember.<br/><br/>She was wearing tight blue skinny jeans that showed off her curvy legs. She was also wearing a navy blue blouse and had her dark hair up in a high ponytail. As far as he could tell, she wasn\u2019t wearing any makeup. He loved that. He had always preferred natural beauty, and she was most definitely a looker.</p><p><br/>Harry watched from his booth in the corner, as she made her way to the bar.<br/><br/>\u201cYou are a life saver! I\u2019m dying to go to this party!\u201d<br/><br/>Felicity rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what you say about every party!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell I heard that Todd would be there tonight, and I want to show him what he&rsquo;s missing out on. That guy, Kenny, from last night is going to go with me. You remember? He\u2019s so hot!\u201d She gushed.<br/><br/>\u201cJenna, you say that about every guy you meet!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh whatever! You know I\u2019m right! You saw him!!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWhatever you say my dear.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYou\u2019re such a buzz kill! We have got to get you a man! You can\u2019t stay pinning over that scumbag forever!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a party to go to?\u201d Felicity asked changing the subject.<br/><br/>\u201cRight!! Thank you again! I owe you big time!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYou still owe me big time from the party last week!\u201d She yelled at the girls retreating figure.<br/><br/>\u201cLove you!\u201d She said laughing, as she rushed out of the bar.<br/><br/>Shaking her head, Felicity walked around the counter. She set about pouring drinks for customers and cleaning up.<br/><br/>Harry watched her for a moment longer. He wasn\u2019t quite sure if he should approach her right away or not. His answer was chosen for him, when she glanced up and caught his eyes on her. She gave him a shy smile, and he could have sworn he saw her blushing.</p><p>Slowly rising from his seat, he made his way over to the bar and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;ll good evening, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Turning towards him, she smiled once more. \u201cI honestly didn&rsquo;t think you would remember who I was today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I ever forget you?\u201d He teased.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHere to kill your liver some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a whiskey, I better start light.\u201d Hearing the door to the bar opening, Harry instinctively turned towards it. His smile fell instantly. \u201cBetter make that a double.\u201d He mumbled turning back to Felicity.</p><p>She looked at him in confusion, but poured his drink anyway. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d She asked with a look of concern.</p><p>\u201cIt was, up until about 5 seconds ago.\u201d He raised his hand, when she went to ask him why. \u201cYou&rsquo;ll see in about two seconds,\u201d he informed.</p><p>Sure enough, a women came bonding up to him. \u201cThere you are!\u201d Looking relieved.</p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d Harry said refusing to look at her and downing his drink. He didn&rsquo;t even have to ask, Felicity refilled his drink eyeing the pair. She could sense his sudden mood change, along with his fury.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been? I&rsquo;ve been calling you nonstop and looking for you everywhere!\u201d She asked placing her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sure you have,\u201d he said with a smirk. \u201cSorry to say that I wasn&rsquo;t under Mark. That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ve been looking right?\u201d</p><p>A look of realization flashed crossed Felicity&rsquo;s face, as she realized who this mystery women was. Courtney looked at Harry. She was not amused. </p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re hilarious, you know that? Are you going to stop this ridiculousness and come home now?\u201d</p><p>Harry finally turned to her, new anger flaring through his veins. \u201cYou&rsquo;re joking right? Do you honestly think I would take you back after your betrayal? I thought you were a little smarter than that.. I guess not.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he could see Felicity trying hard not to laugh. This oddly brightened his mood.</p><p>\u201cWhere&rsquo;s your man?\u201d Harry asked raising his brow. \u201cDid he get tired of your bullshit as well?\u201d</p><p>Courtney&rsquo;s face actually turned red. She wasn&rsquo;t used to not having the upper hand in situation&rsquo;s. It was usually her that did her best to embarrass people who she thought of as lower than her.</p><p>As if on cue, the glass door to the bar opened once more. In walked Mark, looking embarrassed for once.</p><p>\u201cOh look it&rsquo;s the happy couple!\u201d Harry shouted bitterly.</p><p>Turning back to his drink, he noticed Felicity go pale. She was frozen in place staring at Mark. Harry could have sworn he saw a flash of anger in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFelicity? Are you alright?\u201d He whispered so that only she could hear. She remained silent, frozen in place.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>******************************</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Felicity had found herself caught in quite an awkward situation. She was stuck between Harry and his ex. She wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what she was suppose to do. She would feel terrible, if she left him to fend for himself. However, she felt out of place listening to their conversation. Instead, she made sure to keep Harry&rsquo;s cup filled. She knew better than anyone that he would be needing the alcohol.</p><p>She had been lost in a daze watching the pair, when she heard the audible ding. The ding signaled a new customer entering the bar. She looked up instantly and froze in place.</p><p>Standing in the entrance, was someone she had once known very well. He had let his dirty blonde hair grow out a bit, and he had quite a bit of stumble on his chin. She use to hate the patchy beard he had always been trying to grow. He stood as tall as ever, with his broad shoulders and was dressed formally. He must have just come from work.</p><p>Felicity saw red, as soon as his face came into view. A face that she had once loved, she now hated with every fiber of her being. She had wasted four and a half years on him. Years that she could not get back as much as she wanted to.</p><p>He had ended things with her suddenly. He told her that he couldn&rsquo;t force himself to be around her any longer. He also informed her that he had fallen in love with a girl he worked with. All he told her of the other women was that she was a model that he had been representing. Taking a look at Courtney&rsquo;s perfect blonde hair and model&rsquo;s figure, Felicity put two and two together.</p><p>Mark Anderson stood in the entrance for a moment longer. Looking around he spotted who he had come for. He didn&rsquo;t seem to notice Felicity behind the counter.</p><p>Without giving it much thought, she came from behind the counter in record timing. She could sense Harry watching her, and she knew she would look insane to every onlooker. She, however, did not care at the moment. This was the man that had ruined her life and made her afraid to ever love again.</p><p>He froze in his spot, when he saw her come marching towards him. \u201cUmm.. Felicity.. Hi.. I didn&rsquo;t know you still worked here.\u201d He stuttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the fuck do you think you&rsquo;re doing here Mark? You know you aren&rsquo;t allowed on this property ever again. What part of no trespassing do you not understand?\u201d She yelled.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly want to do this now?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly want me to call the cops?\u201d She asked folding her arms. Standing her ground.</p><p>He deliberated for only a moment, before he took a step towards her. He leaned in towards her so that their faces were only inches apart. </p><p>\u201cDo you think I&rsquo;m scared of you?\u201d He hissed.</p><p>\u201cI think you should back the fuck up.\u201d Harry sounded from behind her. His voice was low but filled with malice.</p><p>She could have sworn she saw fear in Mark&rsquo;s eyes at Harry&rsquo;s threat. Standing up straight, he stared them both down.</p><p>\u201cSo you&rsquo;re with him now?\u201d Mark asked pointing between the two of them. Felicity remained silent, her expression remaining neutral. Mark laughed, thinking the thought was extremely hilarious.</p><p>\u201cHonestly I could date anyone, and they would be a million times better than you could ever be. But I&rsquo;m so glad you came by here today so that I can see who you left me for. You couldn&rsquo;t have picked someone more perfect for you. You&rsquo;re both liars and cheaters. Not to mention she&rsquo;s a slut and you&rsquo;re a douche. What a match made in heaven.\u201d</p><p>She could hear Harry chuckling from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know who the hell you think you are to call me a slut.\u201d Courtney said coming from behind them to join Mark.</p><p>\u201cWell if the shoe fits,\u201d Harry shrugged.</p><p>Turning around, Felicity gave him a smile. \u201cNow if you both do not get out of this bar in.. ohhh.. I&rsquo;d say.. about one point two seconds, I will have you escorted off the property in handcuffs. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Turning around, she headed back to the counter. Grabbing the phone off the wall, she held it up for the couple to see. They were both fuming, but decided not to test their fate.</p><p>\u201cCome on Mark.. This place is a dump anyway.\u201d Courtney said turning her nose up. Grabbing his arm, she started towards the exit.</p><p>\u201cAnd stop fucking call me you bitch! I don&rsquo;t know how many times I have to tell you, but we are NEVER getting back together!\u201d Harry yelled after her, already buzzed.</p><p>The pair left the bar, without another word. Felicity let out a deep steadying breath. Placing her arms on the counter, she buried her head into them.</p><p>There was a few moments of silence, before she could sense Harry in front of her once more. Sighing, she lifted her head to face him.</p><p>\u201cWell that was interesting.\u201d He commented.</p><p>His comment took her of guard, causing her to laugh. He smiled brightly at her, enjoying the sound.</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s the understatement of the century,\u201d she told him finally.</p><p>\u201cSooo.. You and Mark huh?\u201d He asked finally.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t ask. That was the biggest mistake and worst four years of my life. I guess it&rsquo;s nice to finally find out who he left me for though. I&rsquo;ll admit, it makes me feel better that she&rsquo;s a whore. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She is a whore.\u201d He said agreeing.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s rather odd though,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s that?\u201d He asked downing another shot.</p><p>\u201cHow your ex turned out to be with my ex. I guess it&rsquo;s a small world after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means we were just destined to meet,\u201d he said in wonder making her blush slightly.</p><p>\u201cThis is highly against rules so please don&rsquo;t tell my boss, but after what just happened I really need a drink.\u201d She told him grabbing a glass and pouring them both a shot.</p><p>\u201cHey who am I to judge?\u201d He teased. \u201cTo the shity exs who brought us together!\u201d Harry said raising his glass.</p><p>Giggling, she mimicked his actions. \u201cCheers!\u201d They said in unison touching their glasses together. </p>",

Instead, she drove him to the nearest hotel and even helped him to his room. She felt as if she were losing her mind. Never had she gone to such great lengths to help out any of her customers before.</p><p>\u2018What could have been so different about this man?\u2019 She wondered, as she helped him through his hotel door.</p><p>Harry was almost completely out of it, by the time his head hit the pillow. Shaking her head, she removed his shoes and covered him up. After much consideration, she decided to leave him a note explaining things.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Harry,</i></p><p><i>You were rather out of it, when I finally got you to your hotel room.</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t think you would remember so I just wanted to let you know that your keys are with the valet. I also made a request on your behalf to room service.</i></p><p><i>Someone should be along in the morning with some orange juice and Advil for the hangover you\u2019re sure to have.</i></p><p><i>Felicity</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>After another moment of deliberation, she added- bartender at Hope\u2019s Bar by her name. Harry had been so completely out of it that she doubted he would remember anything that had happened that night much less her name.</p><p>Looking at his sleeping form one last time, she sighed. He looked rather peaceful in this state of mind. You could hardly tell he was the same heartbroken mess she had spent the better part of her night with.</p><p>She fought the urge to reach out and swipe the hair away that had fallen into his eyes. Instead, she took a deep breath and turned around. Her emotions had been all over the place, and she couldn\u2019t explain why.</p><p>She made her way out of the hotel and into the cool night sky. Looking at her phone, she noticed it was already almost 3 in the morning. She was beyond exhausted and couldn\u2019t wait to get home. She was in desperate need of a hot shower.</p><p>She walked the two long blocks to her small apartment complex. Her neighborhood wasn\u2019t the grandest nor was it the safest. Hurriedly, she opened her door and rushed in. Quickly, she shut the door back and made sure all four locks were secured.</p><p>Setting all her things down, she let out a long breath. Her muscles were aching and her body felt heavy. Starting the shower, she got her clothes ready. She felt relieved as soon as the hot cascading water hit her aching body. Spending more time than usual under the steaming flow she began to relax.</p><p>After much time, she reluctantly turned off the stream and got out. Tiredly she slowly dried off and put her clean pajamas on. She was way to exhausted to worry about making herself something to eat. Instead, she climbed into her big comfy bed and relaxed under the covers. She was fast asleep, as soon as her head hit the pillows.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>*******************************************</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Harry\u2019s POV</b></h2><p><br></p><p>Harry awoke with a massive headache. Looking around, he took in the room. He wasn\u2019t quite sure on where he was or how he had gotten there. His head was fuzzy and he felt sick to his stomach. He had definitely drunk to much last night.<br><br>He could vaguely remember being at the bar and talking with one of the bartenders. Bits and pieces of their conversation started to come back to him.<br><br>He could feel his phone buzzing in his pocket. Fumbling for it, he was finally able to retrieve it. Squinting, he took a look at the bright screen.<br><br>Courtney\u2019s picture flashed across the screen and Harry groaned. \u201cWonderful,\u201d he said out loud.<br><br>Hitting decline, he switched his phone off. Looking around the small hotel room he noticed a note on the nightstand. Sitting up slowly, he grabbed it. He read over it carefully.<br><br>\u2018Felicity,\u2019 he thought. The name sounded oddly familiar. A flash of her face came flooding into his mind.<br><br>His could remember his first thought of her, as he watched her behind the bar. He thought she was rather beautiful, even in her understated attire. He could remember watching her for a while, not entirely sure as to why. She seemed to take his mind off of Courtney and her betrayal, if only for a minute.<br><br>He read over her note once more. Her thoughtfulness made him smile. Not many people would take time out of their day to care for a stranger the way that she had done.<br><br>He took a look at the clock on the table, it was just past 9 in the morning. A knock on hotel room door brought him back to reality.<br><br>Groaning, he slowly got out of bed. Looking down, he noticed he was still in the same clothes he was wearing the day before. They were wrinkled and smelled of pure alcohol. He turned his nose up in disgust, as he stumbled to the door.<br><br>He opened the door to a man in formal attire. He was holding a tray in front of him and had a big smile on his face.<br><br>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said cheerfully. He held out the tray he was holding for Harry to take.<br><br>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told the man politely.<br><br>\u201cHave a good one!\u201d He called out, turning around and heading down the hall.<br><br>Harry took the tray inside his room and shut the door back. Taking a look, he saw a cup of orange juice. Along with the juice was a plate of food and two pills on the side.<br><br>Harry shook his head and smiled slightly to himself. He still could not believe how thoughtful and caring Felicity was. He was in utter awe.<br><br>Downing the pills, he chugged the juice. He was feeling a bit better already. Although his stomach was still turning, he forced himself to eat some of the eggs and toast on his plate.<br><br>Laying back in the bed, he contemplated his life and what had happened in the last 24 hours.<br><br>As hard as he tried, he could not get the imagine of Courtney and Mark together out of his head.

She gave him a shy smile, and he could have sworn he saw her blushing.</p><p>Slowly rising from his seat, he made his way over to the bar and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll good evening, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Turning towards him, she smiled once more. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think you would remember who I was today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I ever forget you?\u201d He teased.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHere to kill your liver some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a whiskey, I better start light.\u201d Hearing the door to the bar opening, Harry instinctively turned towards it. His smile fell instantly. \u201cBetter make that a double.\u201d He mumbled turning back to Felicity.</p><p>She looked at him in confusion, but poured his drink anyway. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d She asked with a look of concern.</p><p>\u201cIt was, up until about 5 seconds ago.\u201d He raised his hand, when she went to ask him why. \u201cYou\u2019ll see in about two seconds,\u201d he informed.</p><p>Sure enough, a women came bonding up to him. \u201cThere you are!\u201d Looking relieved.</p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d Harry said refusing to look at her and downing his drink. He didn\u2019t even have to ask, Felicity refilled his drink eyeing the pair. She could sense his sudden mood change, along with his fury.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been? I\u2019ve been calling you nonstop and looking for you everywhere!\u201d She asked placing her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have,\u201d he said with a smirk. \u201cSorry to say that I wasn\u2019t under Mark. That\u2019s where you\u2019ve been looking right?\u201d</p><p>A look of realization flashed crossed Felicity\u2019s face, as she realized who this mystery women was. Courtney looked at Harry. She was not amused. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious, you know that? Are you going to stop this ridiculousness and come home now?\u201d</p><p>Harry finally turned to her, new anger flaring through his veins. \u201cYou\u2019re joking right? Do you honestly think I would take you back after your betrayal? I thought you were a little smarter than that.. I guess not.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he could see Felicity trying hard not to laugh. This oddly brightened his mood.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your man?\u201d Harry asked raising his brow. \u201cDid he get tired of your bullshit as well?\u201d</p><p>Courtney\u2019s face actually turned red. She wasn\u2019t used to not having the upper hand in situation\u2019s. It was usually her that did her best to embarrass people who she thought of as lower than her.</p><p>As if on cue, the glass door to the bar opened once more. In walked Mark, looking embarrassed for once.</p><p>\u201cOh look it\u2019s the happy couple!\u201d Harry shouted bitterly.</p><p>Turning back to his drink, he noticed Felicity go pale. She was frozen in place staring at Mark. Harry could have sworn he saw a flash of anger in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFelicity? Are you alright?\u201d He whispered so that only she could hear. She remained silent, frozen in place.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>******************************</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Felicity had found herself caught in quite an awkward situation. She was stuck between Harry and his ex. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what she was suppose to do. She would feel terrible, if she left him to fend for himself. However, she felt out of place listening to their conversation. Instead, she made sure to keep Harry\u2019s cup filled. She knew better than anyone that he would be needing the alcohol.</p><p>She had been lost in a daze watching the pair, when she heard the audible ding. The ding signaled a new customer entering the bar. She looked up instantly and froze in place.</p><p>Standing in the entrance, was someone she had once known very well. He had let his dirty blonde hair grow out a bit, and he had quite a bit of stumble on his chin. She use to hate the patchy beard he had always been trying to grow. He stood as tall as ever, with his broad shoulders and was dressed formally. He must have just come from work.</p><p>Felicity saw red, as soon as his face came into view. A face that she had once loved, she now hated with every fiber of her being. She had wasted four and a half years on him. Years that she could not get back as much as she wanted to.</p><p>He had ended things with her suddenly. He told her that he couldn\u2019t force himself to be around her any longer. He also informed her that he had fallen in love with a girl he worked with. All he told her of the other women was that she was a model that he had been representing. Taking a look at Courtney\u2019s perfect blonde hair and model\u2019s figure, Felicity put two and two together.</p><p>Mark Anderson stood in the entrance for a moment longer. Looking around he spotted who he had come for. He didn\u2019t seem to notice Felicity behind the counter.</p><p>Without giving it much thought, she came from behind the counter in record timing. She could sense Harry watching her, and she knew she would look insane to every onlooker. She, however, did not care at the moment. This was the man that had ruined her life and made her afraid to ever love again.</p><p>He froze in his spot, when he saw her come marching towards him. \u201cUmm.. Felicity.. Hi.. I didn\u2019t know you still worked here.\u201d He stuttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing here Mark? You know you aren\u2019t allowed on this property ever again. What part of no trespassing do you not understand?\u201d She yelled.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly want to do this now?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly want me to call the cops?\u201d She asked folding her arms. Standing her ground.</p><p>He deliberated for only a moment, before he took a step towards her. He leaned in towards her so that their faces were only inches apart. </p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m scared of you?\u201d He hissed.</p><p>\u201cI think you should back the fuck up.\u201d Harry sounded from behind her. His voice was low but filled with malice.</p><p>She could have sworn she saw fear in Mark\u2019s eyes at Harry\u2019s threat. Standing up straight, he stared them both down.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re with him now?\u201d Mark asked pointing between the two of them. Felicity remained silent, her expression remaining neutral. Mark laughed, thinking the thought was extremely hilarious.</p><p>\u201cHonestly I could date anyone, and they would be a million times better than you could ever be. But I\u2019m so glad you came by here today so that I can see who you left me for. You couldn\u2019t have picked someone more perfect for you. You\u2019re both liars and cheaters. Not to mention she\u2019s a slut and you\u2019re a douche. What a match made in heaven.\u201d</p><p>She could hear Harry chuckling from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who the hell you think you are to call me a slut.\u201d Courtney said coming from behind them to join Mark.</p><p>\u201cWell if the shoe fits,\u201d Harry shrugged.</p><p>Turning around, Felicity gave him a smile. \u201cNow if you both do not get out of this bar in.. ohhh.. I\u2019d say.. about one point two seconds, I will have you escorted off the property in handcuffs. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Turning around, she headed back to the counter. Grabbing the phone off the wall, she held it up for the couple to see. They were both fuming, but decided not to test their fate.</p><p>\u201cCome on Mark.. This place is a dump anyway.\u201d Courtney said turning her nose up. Grabbing his arm, she started towards the exit.</p><p>\u201cAnd stop fucking call me you bitch! I don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you, but we are NEVER getting back together!\u201d Harry yelled after her, already buzzed.</p><p>The pair left the bar, without another word. Felicity let out a deep steadying breath. Placing her arms on the counter, she buried her head into them.</p><p>There was a few moments of silence, before she could sense Harry in front of her once more. Sighing, she lifted her head to face him.</p><p>\u201cWell that was interesting.\u201d He commented.</p><p>His comment took her of guard, causing her to laugh. He smiled brightly at her, enjoying the sound.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the understatement of the century,\u201d she told him finally.</p><p>\u201cSooo.. You and Mark huh?\u201d He asked finally.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask. That was the biggest mistake and worst four years of my life. I guess it\u2019s nice to finally find out who he left me for though. I\u2019ll admit, it makes me feel better that she\u2019s a whore. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She is a whore.\u201d He said agreeing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather odd though,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He asked downing another shot.</p><p>\u201cHow your ex turned out to be with my ex. I guess it\u2019s a small world after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means we were just destined to meet,\u201d he said in wonder making her blush slightly.</p><p>\u201cThis is highly against rules so please don\u2019t tell my boss, but after what just happened I really need a drink.\u201d She told him grabbing a glass and pouring them both a shot.</p><p>\u201cHey who am I to judge?\u201d He teased. \u201cTo the shity exs who brought us together!\u201d Harry said raising his glass.</p><p>Giggling, she mimicked his actions. \u201cCheers!\u201d They said in unison touching their glasses together. </p></p>",

Instead, she drove him to the nearest hotel and even helped him to his room. She felt as if she were losing her mind. Never had she gone to such great lengths to help out any of her customers before.</p><p>\u2018What could have been so different about this man?\u2019 She wondered, as she helped him through his hotel door.</p><p>Harry was almost completely out of it, by the time his head hit the pillow. Shaking her head, she removed his shoes and covered him up. After much consideration, she decided to leave him a note explaining things.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Harry,</i></p><p><i>You were rather out of it, when I finally got you to your hotel room.</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t think you would remember so I just wanted to let you know that your keys are with the valet. I also made a request on your behalf to room service.</i></p><p><i>Someone should be along in the morning with some orange juice and Advil for the hangover you\u2019re sure to have.</i></p><p><i>Felicity</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>After another moment of deliberation, she added- bartender at Hope\u2019s Bar by her name. Harry had been so completely out of it that she doubted he would remember anything that had happened that night much less her name.</p><p>Looking at his sleeping form one last time, she sighed. He looked rather peaceful in this state of mind. You could hardly tell he was the same heartbroken mess she had spent the better part of her night with.</p><p>She fought the urge to reach out and swipe the hair away that had fallen into his eyes. Instead, she took a deep breath and turned around. Her emotions had been all over the place, and she couldn\u2019t explain why.</p><p>She made her way out of the hotel and into the cool night sky. Looking at her phone, she noticed it was already almost 3 in the morning. She was beyond exhausted and couldn\u2019t wait to get home. She was in desperate need of a hot shower.</p><p>She walked the two long blocks to her small apartment complex. Her neighborhood wasn\u2019t the grandest nor was it the safest. Hurriedly, she opened her door and rushed in. Quickly, she shut the door back and made sure all four locks were secured.</p><p>Setting all her things down, she let out a long breath. Her muscles were aching and her body felt heavy. Starting the shower, she got her clothes ready. She felt relieved as soon as the hot cascading water hit her aching body. Spending more time than usual under the steaming flow she began to relax.</p><p>After much time, she reluctantly turned off the stream and got out. Tiredly she slowly dried off and put her clean pajamas on. She was way to exhausted to worry about making herself something to eat. Instead, she climbed into her big comfy bed and relaxed under the covers. She was fast asleep, as soon as her head hit the pillows.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>*******************************************</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Harry\u2019s POV</b></h2><p><br></p><p>Harry awoke with a massive headache. Looking around, he took in the room. He wasn\u2019t quite sure on where he was or how he had gotten there. His head was fuzzy and he felt sick to his stomach. He had definitely drunk to much last night.<br><br>He could vaguely remember being at the bar and talking with one of the bartenders. Bits and pieces of their conversation started to come back to him.<br><br>He could feel his phone buzzing in his pocket. Fumbling for it, he was finally able to retrieve it. Squinting, he took a look at the bright screen.<br><br>Courtney\u2019s picture flashed across the screen and Harry groaned. \u201cWonderful,\u201d he said out loud.<br><br>Hitting decline, he switched his phone off. Looking around the small hotel room he noticed a note on the nightstand. Sitting up slowly, he grabbed it. He read over it carefully.<br><br>\u2018Felicity,\u2019 he thought. The name sounded oddly familiar. A flash of her face came flooding into his mind.<br><br>His could remember his first thought of her, as he watched her behind the bar. He thought she was rather beautiful, even in her understated attire. He could remember watching her for a while, not entirely sure as to why. She seemed to take his mind off of Courtney and her betrayal, if only for a minute.<br><br>He read over her note once more. Her thoughtfulness made him smile. Not many people would take time out of their day to care for a stranger the way that she had done.<br><br>He took a look at the clock on the table, it was just past 9 in the morning. A knock on hotel room door brought him back to reality.<br><br>Groaning, he slowly got out of bed. Looking down, he noticed he was still in the same clothes he was wearing the day before. They were wrinkled and smelled of pure alcohol. He turned his nose up in disgust, as he stumbled to the door.<br><br>He opened the door to a man in formal attire. He was holding a tray in front of him and had a big smile on his face.<br><br>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said cheerfully. He held out the tray he was holding for Harry to take.<br><br>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told the man politely.<br><br>\u201cHave a good one!\u201d He called out, turning around and heading down the hall.<br><br>Harry took the tray inside his room and shut the door back. Taking a look, he saw a cup of orange juice. Along with the juice was a plate of food and two pills on the side.<br><br>Harry shook his head and smiled slightly to himself. He still could not believe how thoughtful and caring Felicity was. He was in utter awe.<br><br>Downing the pills, he chugged the juice. He was feeling a bit better already. Although his stomach was still turning, he forced himself to eat some of the eggs and toast on his plate.<br><br>Laying back in the bed, he contemplated his life and what had happened in the last 24 hours.<br><br>As hard as he tried, he could not get the imagine of Courtney and Mark together out of his head. It seemed to be on a never ending loop, playing in his brain. He wanted to rid himself of the torturous imagine, but he was not sure of how to do it.<br><br>He had thought that drowning himself in alcohol would have been the trick, however, it didn\u2019t seem to help all to much. Although, it did seem to numb him enough to where he didn\u2019t feel the pain quite as bad.<br><br>Giving it some though, he decided to send some flowers to the bar. It was the least he could do to thank Felicity for the kindness she had shown him.<br><br>Reluctantly he gathered his few belongings and headed out of the hotel. The sun was extremely bright and hurt his already pounding head even more.<br><br>He waited for the valet to bring his car around and tipped him once he did. Harry knee what he had to do, although every bone in his body opposed the idea.<br><br>He headed back to his home. Up until yesterday, he had always been rather fond of this house. Now, he couldn\u2019t stand to even look at it.<br><br>Quickly, he enter the house in his and raced to his room. Without so much as a glance at his bed, he headed to his closet. Grabbing a duffel bag, he pack him some extra clothes in it.<br><br>Although he hated being in this house any longer than he had to, he decided to take a quick shower and put on fresh clothing. He had never been one to be able to go without bathing. He couldn\u2019t stand being dirty nor did he enjoy reeking.<br><br>He was in and out of the house in record time. He had spent less than an hour getting together his essential ideas and taking a fast shower.<br><br>Taking one final look at the house, he thought of a plan. Although the idea might seem insane to others, he decided he would put this house up for sale. He knew that he would never be able to sleep in that bed again. Nor would he ever be able to enter the house without picturing his ex and her lover naked.<br><br>As he got back into his car, he grabbed his phone and called his realtor. He explained his situation in a rush and informed the man of what he wanted.<br><br>Larry has been more than eager to help. He could smell a quick and rather expensive sale headed his way. Thanking him, Harry had to make one more call.<br><br>Calling a local locksmith, he made arrangements to have his locks to the house replace. He informed the man that he would have his assistant drop buy with the keys. He wanted this done as soon as possible, in order to keep Courtney out of the house entirely.<br><br>Feeling a little better now that he had things squared away, Harry switched his phone back off. He knew that Courtney would continue to harass him, and he would rather not deal with her. She had never been one to give up, when it came to something she wanted. It was something that he had once admired her for.<br><br>Putting his car into drive he headed in the direction of the bar. It was only a little past 1 now, but he didn\u2019t care. He needed a drink to numb the pain. He still felt like his heart had been ripped from his chest.<br><br>Pulling up outside of Hope\u2019s, he took in a deep breath. He wondered if Felicity would be working today, part of him really hoped that she was.<br><br>Walking into the dimly lit bar, he took a look around. To his utter disappointment, she was no where in site. Sighing he walked to the back of the room and took a seat in the corner booth.<br><br>Ordering his drink of choice, whiskey, he leaned back in the booth and closed his eyes.<br><br>\u201cFelicity!! Thank God!!\u201d He heard, causing his head to snap up.<br><br>Walking through the glass doors, she smiled brightly at the girl behind the counter. Through sober eyes, she looked even more radiate then Harry could remember.<br><br>She was wearing tight blue skinny jeans that showed off her curvy legs. She was also wearing a navy blue blouse and had her dark hair up in a high ponytail. As far as he could tell, she wasn\u2019t wearing any makeup. He loved that. He had always preferred natural beauty, and she was most definitely a looker.</p><p><br>Harry watched from his booth in the corner, as she made her way to the bar.<br><br>\u201cYou are a life saver! I\u2019m dying to go to this party!\u201d<br><br>Felicity rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what you say about every party!\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell I heard that Todd would be there tonight, and I want to show him what he\u2019s missing out on. That guy, Kenny, from last night is going to go with me. You remember? He\u2019s so hot!\u201d She gushed.<br><br>\u201cJenna, you say that about every guy you meet!\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh whatever! You know I\u2019m right! You saw him!!\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhatever you say my dear.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re such a buzz kill! We have got to get you a man! You can\u2019t stay pinning over that scumbag forever!\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a party to go to?\u201d Felicity asked changing the subject.<br><br>\u201cRight!! Thank you again! I owe you big time!\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou still owe me big time from the party last week!\u201d She yelled at the girls retreating figure.<br><br>\u201cLove you!\u201d She said laughing, as she rushed out of the bar.<br><br>Shaking her head, Felicity walked around the counter. She set about pouring drinks for customers and cleaning up.<br><br>Harry watched her for a moment longer. He wasn\u2019t quite sure if he should approach her right away or not. His answer was chosen for him, when she glanced up and caught his eyes on her. She gave him a shy smile, and he could have sworn he saw her blushing.</p><p>Slowly rising from his seat, he made his way over to the bar and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll good evening, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Turning towards him, she smiled once more. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think you would remember who I was today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I ever forget you?\u201d He teased.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHere to kill your liver some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a whiskey, I better start light.\u201d Hearing the door to the bar opening, Harry instinctively turned towards it. His smile fell instantly. \u201cBetter make that a double.\u201d He mumbled turning back to Felicity.</p><p>She looked at him in confusion, but poured his drink anyway. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d She asked with a look of concern.</p><p>\u201cIt was, up until about 5 seconds ago.\u201d He raised his hand, when she went to ask him why. \u201cYou\u2019ll see in about two seconds,\u201d he informed.</p><p>Sure enough, a women came bonding up to him. \u201cThere you are!\u201d Looking relieved.</p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d Harry said refusing to look at her and downing his drink. He didn\u2019t even have to ask, Felicity refilled his drink eyeing the pair. She could sense his sudden mood change, along with his fury.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been? I\u2019ve been calling you nonstop and looking for you everywhere!\u201d She asked placing her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have,\u201d he said with a smirk. \u201cSorry to say that I wasn\u2019t under Mark. That\u2019s where you\u2019ve been looking right?\u201d</p><p>A look of realization flashed crossed Felicity\u2019s face, as she realized who this mystery women was. Courtney looked at Harry. She was not amused. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious, you know that? Are you going to stop this ridiculousness and come home now?\u201d</p><p>Harry finally turned to her, new anger flaring through his veins. \u201cYou\u2019re joking right? Do you honestly think I would take you back after your betrayal? I thought you were a little smarter than that.. I guess not.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he could see Felicity trying hard not to laugh. This oddly brightened his mood.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your man?\u201d Harry asked raising his brow. \u201cDid he get tired of your bullshit as well?\u201d</p><p>Courtney\u2019s face actually turned red. She wasn\u2019t used to not having the upper hand in situation\u2019s. It was usually her that did her best to embarrass people who she thought of as lower than her.</p><p>As if on cue, the glass door to the bar opened once more. In walked Mark, looking embarrassed for once.</p><p>\u201cOh look it\u2019s the happy couple!\u201d Harry shouted bitterly.</p><p>Turning back to his drink, he noticed Felicity go pale. She was frozen in place staring at Mark. Harry could have sworn he saw a flash of anger in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFelicity? Are you alright?\u201d He whispered so that only she could hear. She remained silent, frozen in place.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>******************************</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Felicity had found herself caught in quite an awkward situation. She was stuck between Harry and his ex. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what she was suppose to do. She would feel terrible, if she left him to fend for himself. However, she felt out of place listening to their conversation. Instead, she made sure to keep Harry\u2019s cup filled. She knew better than anyone that he would be needing the alcohol.</p><p>She had been lost in a daze watching the pair, when she heard the audible ding. The ding signaled a new customer entering the bar. She looked up instantly and froze in place.</p><p>Standing in the entrance, was someone she had once known very well. He had let his dirty blonde hair grow out a bit, and he had quite a bit of stumble on his chin. She use to hate the patchy beard he had always been trying to grow. He stood as tall as ever, with his broad shoulders and was dressed formally. He must have just come from work.</p><p>Felicity saw red, as soon as his face came into view. A face that she had once loved, she now hated with every fiber of her being. She had wasted four and a half years on him. Years that she could not get back as much as she wanted to.</p><p>He had ended things with her suddenly. He told her that he couldn\u2019t force himself to be around her any longer. He also informed her that he had fallen in love with a girl he worked with. All he told her of the other women was that she was a model that he had been representing. Taking a look at Courtney\u2019s perfect blonde hair and model\u2019s figure, Felicity put two and two together.</p><p>Mark Anderson stood in the entrance for a moment longer. Looking around he spotted who he had come for. He didn\u2019t seem to notice Felicity behind the counter.</p><p>Without giving it much thought, she came from behind the counter in record timing. She could sense Harry watching her, and she knew she would look insane to every onlooker. She, however, did not care at the moment. This was the man that had ruined her life and made her afraid to ever love again.</p><p>He froze in his spot, when he saw her come marching towards him. \u201cUmm.. Felicity.. Hi.. I didn\u2019t know you still worked here.\u201d He stuttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing here Mark? You know you aren\u2019t allowed on this property ever again. What part of no trespassing do you not understand?\u201d She yelled.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly want to do this now?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly want me to call the cops?\u201d She asked folding her arms. Standing her ground.</p><p>He deliberated for only a moment, before he took a step towards her. He leaned in towards her so that their faces were only inches apart. </p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m scared of you?\u201d He hissed.</p><p>\u201cI think you should back the fuck up.\u201d Harry sounded from behind her. His voice was low but filled with malice.</p><p>She could have sworn she saw fear in Mark\u2019s eyes at Harry\u2019s threat. Standing up straight, he stared them both down.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re with him now?\u201d Mark asked pointing between the two of them. Felicity remained silent, her expression remaining neutral. Mark laughed, thinking the thought was extremely hilarious.</p><p>\u201cHonestly I could date anyone, and they would be a million times better than you could ever be. But I\u2019m so glad you came by here today so that I can see who you left me for. You couldn\u2019t have picked someone more perfect for you. You\u2019re both liars and cheaters. Not to mention she\u2019s a slut and you\u2019re a douche. What a match made in heaven.\u201d</p><p>She could hear Harry chuckling from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who the hell you think you are to call me a slut.\u201d Courtney said coming from behind them to join Mark.</p><p>\u201cWell if the shoe fits,\u201d Harry shrugged.</p><p>Turning around, Felicity gave him a smile. \u201cNow if you both do not get out of this bar in.. ohhh.. I\u2019d say.. about one point two seconds, I will have you escorted off the property in handcuffs. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Turning around, she headed back to the counter. Grabbing the phone off the wall, she held it up for the couple to see. They were both fuming, but decided not to test their fate.</p><p>\u201cCome on Mark.. This place is a dump anyway.\u201d Courtney said turning her nose up. Grabbing his arm, she started towards the exit.</p><p>\u201cAnd stop fucking call me you bitch! I don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you, but we are NEVER getting back together!\u201d Harry yelled after her, already buzzed.</p><p>The pair left the bar, without another word. Felicity let out a deep steadying breath. Placing her arms on the counter, she buried her head into them.</p><p>There was a few moments of silence, before she could sense Harry in front of her once more. Sighing, she lifted her head to face him.</p><p>\u201cWell that was interesting.\u201d He commented.</p><p>His comment took her of guard, causing her to laugh. He smiled brightly at her, enjoying the sound.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the understatement of the century,\u201d she told him finally.</p><p>\u201cSooo.. You and Mark huh?\u201d He asked finally.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask. That was the biggest mistake and worst four years of my life. I guess it\u2019s nice to finally find out who he left me for though. I\u2019ll admit, it makes me feel better that she\u2019s a whore. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She is a whore.\u201d He said agreeing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather odd though,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He asked downing another shot.</p><p>\u201cHow your ex turned out to be with my ex. I guess it\u2019s a small world after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means we were just destined to meet,\u201d he said in wonder making her blush slightly.</p><p>\u201cThis is highly against rules so please don\u2019t tell my boss, but after what just happened I really need a drink.\u201d She told him grabbing a glass and pouring them both a shot.</p><p>\u201cHey who am I to judge?\u201d He teased. \u201cTo the shity exs who brought us together!\u201d Harry said raising his glass.</p><p>Giggling, she mimicked his actions. \u201cCheers!\u201d They said in unison touching their glasses together. </p></p>",

Instead, she drove him to the nearest hotel and even helped him to his room. She felt as if she were losing her mind. Never had she gone to such great lengths to help out any of her customers before.</p><p>&lsquo;What could have been so different about this man?&rsquo; She wondered, as she helped him through his hotel door.</p><p>Harry was almost completely out of it, by the time his head hit the pillow. Shaking her head, she removed his shoes and covered him up. After much consideration, she decided to leave him a note explaining things.</p><p><br /></p><p><i>Harry,</i></p><p><i>You were rather out of it, when I finally got you to your hotel room.</i></p><p><i>I didn&rsquo;t think you would remember so I just wanted to let you know that your keys are with the valet. I also made a request on your behalf to room service.</i></p><p><i>Someone should be along in the morning with some orange juice and Advil for the hangover you&rsquo;re sure to have.</i></p><p><i>Felicity</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>After another moment of deliberation, she added- bartender at Hope&rsquo;s Bar by her name. Harry had been so completely out of it that she doubted he would remember anything that had happened that night much less her name.</p><p>Looking at his sleeping form one last time, she sighed. He looked rather peaceful in this state of mind. You could hardly tell he was the same heartbroken mess she had spent the better part of her night with.</p><p>She fought the urge to reach out and swipe the hair away that had fallen into his eyes. Instead, she took a deep breath and turned around. Her emotions had been all over the place, and she couldn&rsquo;t explain why.</p><p>She made her way out of the hotel and into the cool night sky. Looking at her phone, she noticed it was already almost 3 in the morning. She was beyond exhausted and couldn&rsquo;t wait to get home. She was in desperate need of a hot shower.</p><p>She walked the two long blocks to her small apartment complex. Her neighborhood wasn&rsquo;t the grandest nor was it the safest. Hurriedly, she opened her door and rushed in. Quickly, she shut the door back and made sure all four locks were secured.</p><p>Setting all her things down, she let out a long breath. Her muscles were aching and her body felt heavy. Starting the shower, she got her clothes ready. She felt relieved as soon as the hot cascading water hit her aching body. Spending more time than usual under the steaming flow she began to relax.</p><p>After much time, she reluctantly turned off the stream and got out. Tiredly she slowly dried off and put her clean pajamas on. She was way to exhausted to worry about making herself something to eat. Instead, she climbed into her big comfy bed and relaxed under the covers. She was fast asleep, as soon as her head hit the pillows.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>*******************************************</p><p><br /></p><h2><b>Harry&rsquo;s POV</b></h2><p><br /></p><p>Harry awoke with a massive headache. Looking around, he took in the room. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure on where he was or how he had gotten there. His head was fuzzy and he felt sick to his stomach. He had definitely drunk to much last night.<br /><br />He could vaguely remember being at the bar and talking with one of the bartenders. Bits and pieces of their conversation started to come back to him.<br /><br />He could feel his phone buzzing in his pocket. Fumbling for it, he was finally able to retrieve it. Squinting, he took a look at the bright screen.<br /><br />Courtney&rsquo;s picture flashed across the screen and Harry groaned. &ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; he said out loud.<br /><br />Hitting decline, he switched his phone off. Looking around the small hotel room he noticed a note on the nightstand. Sitting up slowly, he grabbed it. He read over it carefully.<br /><br />&lsquo;Felicity,&rsquo; he thought. The name sounded oddly familiar. A flash of her face came flooding into his mind.<br /><br />His could remember his first thought of her, as he watched her behind the bar. He thought she was rather beautiful, even in her understated attire. He could remember watching her for a while, not entirely sure as to why. She seemed to take his mind off of Courtney and her betrayal, if only for a minute.<br /><br />He read over her note once more. Her thoughtfulness made him smile. Not many people would take time out of their day to care for a stranger the way that she had done.<br /><br />He took a look at the clock on the table, it was just past 9 in the morning. A knock on hotel room door brought him back to reality.<br /><br />Groaning, he slowly got out of bed. Looking down, he noticed he was still in the same clothes he was wearing the day before. They were wrinkled and smelled of pure alcohol. He turned his nose up in disgust, as he stumbled to the door.<br /><br />He opened the door to a man in formal attire. He was holding a tray in front of him and had a big smile on his face.<br /><br />&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. He held out the tray he was holding for Harry to take.<br /><br />&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he told the man politely.<br /><br />&ldquo;Have a good one!&rdquo; He called out, turning around and heading down the hall.<br /><br />Harry took the tray inside his room and shut the door back. Taking a look, he saw a cup of orange juice. Along with the juice was a plate of food and two pills on the side.<br /><br />Harry shook his head and smiled slightly to himself. He still could not believe how thoughtful and caring Felicity was. He was in utter awe.<br /><br />Downing the pills, he chugged the juice. He was feeling a bit better already. Although his stomach was still turning, he forced himself to eat some of the eggs and toast on his plate.<br /><br />Laying back in the bed, he contemplated his life and what had happened in the last 24 hours.<br /><br />As hard as he tried, he could not get the imagine of Courtney and Mark together out of his head. It seemed to be on a never ending loop, playing in his brain. He wanted to rid himself of the torturous imagine, but he was not sure of how to do it.<br /><br />He had thought that drowning himself in alcohol would have been the trick, however, it didn&rsquo;t seem to help all to much. Although, it did seem to numb him enough to where he didn&rsquo;t feel the pain quite as bad.<br /><br />Giving it some though, he decided to send some flowers to the bar. It was the least he could do to thank Felicity for the kindness she had shown him.<br /><br />Reluctantly he gathered his few belongings and headed out of the hotel. The sun was extremely bright and hurt his already pounding head even more.<br /><br />He waited for the valet to bring his car around and tipped him once he did. Harry knee what he had to do, although every bone in his body opposed the idea.<br /><br />He headed back to his home. Up until yesterday, he had always been rather fond of this house. Now, he couldn&rsquo;t stand to even look at it.<br /><br />Quickly, he enter the house in his and raced to his room. Without so much as a glance at his bed, he headed to his closet. Grabbing a duffel bag, he pack him some extra clothes in it.<br /><br />Although he hated being in this house any longer than he had to, he decided to take a quick shower and put on fresh clothing. He had never been one to be able to go without bathing. He couldn&rsquo;t stand being dirty nor did he enjoy reeking.<br /><br />He was in and out of the house in record time. He had spent less than an hour getting together his essential ideas and taking a fast shower.<br /><br />Taking one final look at the house, he thought of a plan. Although the idea might seem insane to others, he decided he would put this house up for sale. He knew that he would never be able to sleep in that bed again. Nor would he ever be able to enter the house without picturing his ex and her lover naked.<br /><br />As he got back into his car, he grabbed his phone and called his realtor. He explained his situation in a rush and informed the man of what he wanted.<br /><br />Larry has been more than eager to help. He could smell a quick and rather expensive sale headed his way. Thanking him, Harry had to make one more call.<br /><br />Calling a local locksmith, he made arrangements to have his locks to the house replace. He informed the man that he would have his assistant drop buy with the keys. He wanted this done as soon as possible, in order to keep Courtney out of the house entirely.<br /><br />Feeling a little better now that he had things squared away, Harry switched his phone back off. He knew that Courtney would continue to harass him, and he would rather not deal with her. She had never been one to give up, when it came to something she wanted. It was something that he had once admired her for.<br /><br />Putting his car into drive he headed in the direction of the bar. It was only a little past 1 now, but he didn&rsquo;t care. He needed a drink to numb the pain. He still felt like his heart had been ripped from his chest.<br /><br />Pulling up outside of Hope&rsquo;s, he took in a deep breath. He wondered if Felicity would be working today, part of him really hoped that she was.<br /><br />Walking into the dimly lit bar, he took a look around. To his utter disappointment, she was no where in site. Sighing he walked to the back of the room and took a seat in the corner booth.<br /><br />Ordering his drink of choice, whiskey, he leaned back in the booth and closed his eyes.<br /><br />&ldquo;Felicity!! Thank God!!&rdquo; He heard, causing his head to snap up.<br /><br />Walking through the glass doors, she smiled brightly at the girl behind the counter. Through sober eyes, she looked even more radiate then Harry could remember.<br /><br />She was wearing tight blue skinny jeans that showed off her curvy legs. She was also wearing a navy blue blouse and had her dark hair up in a high ponytail. As far as he could tell, she wasn&rsquo;t wearing any makeup. He loved that. He had always preferred natural beauty, and she was most definitely a looker.</p><p><br />Harry watched from his booth in the corner, as she made her way to the bar.<br /><br />&ldquo;You are a life saver! I&rsquo;m dying to go to this party!&rdquo;<br /><br />Felicity rolled her eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you say about every party!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well I heard that Todd would be there tonight, and I want to show him what he&rsquo;s missing out on. That guy, Kenny, from last night is going to go with me. You remember? He&rsquo;s so hot!&rdquo; She gushed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Jenna, you say that about every guy you meet!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh whatever! You know I&rsquo;m right! You saw him!!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Whatever you say my dear.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a buzz kill! We have got to get you a man! You can&rsquo;t stay pinning over that scumbag forever!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a party to go to?&rdquo; Felicity asked changing the subject.<br /><br />&ldquo;Right!! Thank you again! I owe you big time!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You still owe me big time from the party last week!&rdquo; She yelled at the girls retreating figure.<br /><br />&ldquo;Love you!&rdquo; She said laughing, as she rushed out of the bar.<br /><br />Shaking her head, Felicity walked around the counter. She set about pouring drinks for customers and cleaning up.<br /><br />Harry watched her for a moment longer. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure if he should approach her right away or not. His answer was chosen for him, when she glanced up and caught his eyes on her. She gave him a shy smile, and he could have sworn he saw her blushing.</p><p>Slowly rising from his seat, he made his way over to the bar and sat down.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll good evening, my lady.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning towards him, she smiled once more. &ldquo;I honestly didn&rsquo;t think you would remember who I was today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could I ever forget you?&rdquo; He teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; she said with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Here to kill your liver some more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know me so well,&rdquo; he said with a chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I get for you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about a whiskey, I better start light.&rdquo; Hearing the door to the bar opening, Harry instinctively turned towards it. His smile fell instantly. &ldquo;Better make that a double.&rdquo; He mumbled turning back to Felicity.</p><p>She looked at him in confusion, but poured his drink anyway. &ldquo;Everything alright?&rdquo; She asked with a look of concern.</p><p>&ldquo;It was, up until about 5 seconds ago.&rdquo; He raised his hand, when she went to ask him why. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see in about two seconds,&rdquo; he informed.</p><p>Sure enough, a women came bonding up to him. &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; Looking relieved.</p><p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; Harry said refusing to look at her and downing his drink. He didn&rsquo;t even have to ask, Felicity refilled his drink eyeing the pair. She could sense his sudden mood change, along with his fury.</p><p>&ldquo;Where the hell have you been?

I&rsquo;d say.. about one point two seconds, I will have you escorted off the property in handcuffs. Your choice.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning around, she headed back to the counter. Grabbing the phone off the wall, she held it up for the couple to see. They were both fuming, but decided not to test their fate.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on Mark.. This place is a dump anyway.&rdquo; Courtney said turning her nose up. Grabbing his arm, she started towards the exit.</p><p>&ldquo;And stop fucking call me you bitch! I don&rsquo;t know how many times I have to tell you, but we are NEVER getting back together!&rdquo; Harry yelled after her, already buzzed.</p><p>The pair left the bar, without another word. Felicity let out a deep steadying breath. Placing her arms on the counter, she buried her head into them.</p><p>There was a few moments of silence, before she could sense Harry in front of her once more. Sighing, she lifted her head to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well that was interesting.&rdquo; He commented.</p><p>His comment took her of guard, causing her to laugh. He smiled brightly at her, enjoying the sound.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the understatement of the century,&rdquo; she told him finally.</p><p>&ldquo;Sooo.. You and Mark huh?&rdquo; He asked finally.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask. That was the biggest mistake and worst four years of my life. I guess it&rsquo;s nice to finally find out who he left me for though. I&rsquo;ll admit, it makes me feel better that she&rsquo;s a whore. No offense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? She is a whore.&rdquo; He said agreeing.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather odd though,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; He asked downing another shot.</p><p>&ldquo;How your ex turned out to be with my ex. I guess it&rsquo;s a small world after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess that means we were just destined to meet,&rdquo; he said in wonder making her blush slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;This is highly against rules so please don&rsquo;t tell my boss, but after what just happened I really need a drink.&rdquo; She told him grabbing a glass and pouring them both a shot.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey who am I to judge?&rdquo; He teased. &ldquo;To the shity exs who brought us together!&rdquo; Harry said raising his glass.</p><p>Giggling, she mimicked his actions. &ldquo;Cheers!&rdquo; They said in unison touching their glasses together. </p></p>",
