And also, the whole you're both Stark and Greyjoy you don't have to choose is in fact what he WILL have to do.  Unlike Theon who has strong ties to Greyjoys, his sister, Jon just doesn't have this.",
        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I do think this scene is very meaningful for Jon and the parentage reveal but what this could foreshadow exactly is less certain, I think.\u00a0</p><p>The fandom has discussed over and over again and made a very strong case for the fact that Theon is very much a foil for Jon. They\u2019re both outsiders within the Stark family and they both want to be Starks but the way they choose to express that desire is in opposite directions. Theon twists himself, becomes embittered, betrays his best friend and wrecks Winterfell. Jon dreams about becoming a Stark honorably, by proving his worth, honoring the legacy of his father and Robb and rebuilding Winterfell. This is why while Theon falls from grace, ends up in a situation where he is tortured and\u00a0\u201cremade\u201d, Jon beings getting closer and closer to his deep seethed desire. Because he chose the right way of doing it and because his love for his Stark family supersedes his ambitions.\u00a0</p><p>So it\u2019s no small wonder that at some point in the narrative, they would both be faced with the same dilemma: who am I? Am I a Stark or a Greyjoy? A Stark or a Targareyen? It\u2019s also no surprise that they have to choose, or seemingly choose, between being a Stark or a historical enemy of the Starks. But while I think Jon is poised to blend the two sides of his heritage, Theon is poised to be a Greyjoy but actually redefine what a Greyjoy is.\u00a0</p><p>The Greyjoys, as a family, are at a crossroads at this time. They can choose to stay in the past, as reavers and thugs or move on and become something else. And all of the Greyjoys that are left (we\u2019re talking strictly show here) are trying to do that in their own way. The reason why Euron won that election and became King is because he promised change. In his way, he is trying to push the Greyjoys and the Iron Islands forward. He is not content being stuck on the edge of the continent, pillaging villages for the rest of time. He wants to gain influence and power.\u00a0</p><p>Both Euron and Yara understand where the power of the Iron Islands truly lays: in their fleet. But Yara isn\u2019t really a visionary, in the same way Euron is. She wants to build a fleet and then continue to terrorize the continent, so essentially do what the Ironborn have been doing for centuries, just with a better navy. She eventually backtracks on that when she enters her alliance with D*ny but she does it because she has no choice and because she needs to kill her uncle.\u00a0</p><p>The fact that Euron is an unsavory character shouldn\u2019t blind people from the fact that what he wants to do is far more progressive and beneficial for the Ironborn than Yara\u2019s plan. Yara is very much a reminiscent of the past, Euron is paving the way to the future: a future that includes powerful alliances for the Greyjoys and that positions them for collaboration and true inclusion within the socio-economical sphere.\u00a0</p><p>However Euron is a villian. He\u2019s unstable and crazy and also violently cruel. So he will be brought down at some point in the future. The only person viable enough to actually bring that change to the Ironborn and do it in a positive way is Theon. Considering his strong alliance with House Stark, he is better positioned than Euron or Yara, to do this. And I think that\u2019s where he\u2019s heading. I think he will finish this series becoming either Lord of the Iron Islands or king. But the Iron Islands as a whole won\u2019t be the black sheep of Westeros anymore but rather House Stark\u2019s (the royal house, the Seven Pointed Star willing) strongest ally and their naval force. So where their fathers\u2019 generation failed in creating a strong alliance, Theon and Jon/Sansa will succeed in creating a lasting bond between these 2 factions.\u00a0</p><p>As for Jon, of course his words to Theon will come back into his own story. I do agree that unlike Theon, Jon doesn\u2019t have strong ties to his Targareyen family and because of who that family is now (namely D*ny), he will have to make a choice. He can\u2019t be both a Stark and a Targareyen because D*ny won\u2019t allow it. In order to save all that he cares about, he will have to go against D*ny and by doing so betray the legacy of the Targareyens. He has to reject the Fire and Blood policy of his family and their conquering ways. So, in doing so, he will become, for all those around him, a Stark.\u00a0</p><p>But here\u2019s the rub \u2026 in order to defeat D*ny, in order to bring lasting peace to the continent, he will also have to embrace his Targareyen heritage \u2026 Because it\u2019s the best way for him to actually be effective against her. I have speculated that Jon will ride a dragon and I\u2019m pretty much convinced that will happen. He will also need to assert his Targareyen heritage in order to ascend the throne of Westeros (which again I think will happen) because the Starks have no right to the throne of the 7 kingdoms but the Targareyens, historically, do. So he will need to do what Robert Baratheon did before him, assert his Targareyen heritage while actively trying to destroy it.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

They can choose to stay in the past, as reavers and thugs or move on and become something else. And all of the Greyjoys that are left (we\u2019re talking strictly show here) are trying to do that in their own way. The reason why Euron won that election and became King is because he promised change. In his way, he is trying to push the Greyjoys and the Iron Islands forward. He is not content being stuck on the edge of the continent, pillaging villages for the rest of time. He wants to gain influence and power.\u00a0</p><p>Both Euron and Yara understand where the power of the Iron Islands truly lays: in their fleet. But Yara isn\u2019t really a visionary, in the same way Euron is. She wants to build a fleet and then continue to terrorize the continent, so essentially do what the Ironborn have been doing for centuries, just with a better navy. She eventually backtracks on that when she enters her alliance with D*ny but she does it because she has no choice and because she needs to kill her uncle.\u00a0</p><p>The fact that Euron is an unsavory character shouldn\u2019t blind people from the fact that what he wants to do is far more progressive and beneficial for the Ironborn than Yara\u2019s plan. Yara is very much a reminiscent of the past, Euron is paving the way to the future: a future that includes powerful alliances for the Greyjoys and that positions them for collaboration and true inclusion within the socio-economical sphere.\u00a0</p><p>However Euron is a villian. He\u2019s unstable and crazy and also violently cruel. So he will be brought down at some point in the future. The only person viable enough to actually bring that change to the Ironborn and do it in a positive way is Theon. Considering his strong alliance with House Stark, he is better positioned than Euron or Yara, to do this. And I think that\u2019s where he\u2019s heading. I think he will finish this series becoming either Lord of the Iron Islands or king. But the Iron Islands as a whole won\u2019t be the black sheep of Westeros anymore but rather House Stark\u2019s (the royal house, the Seven Pointed Star willing) strongest ally and their naval force. So where their fathers\u2019 generation failed in creating a strong alliance, Theon and Jon/Sansa will succeed in creating a lasting bond between these 2 factions.\u00a0</p><p>As for Jon, of course his words to Theon will come back into his own story. I do agree that unlike Theon, Jon doesn\u2019t have strong ties to his Targareyen family and because of who that family is now (namely D*ny), he will have to make a choice. He can\u2019t be both a Stark and a Targareyen because D*ny won\u2019t allow it. In order to save all that he cares about, he will have to go against D*ny and by doing so betray the legacy of the Targareyens. He has to reject the Fire and Blood policy of his family and their conquering ways. So, in doing so, he will become, for all those around him, a Stark.\u00a0</p><p>But here\u2019s the rub \u2026 in order to defeat D*ny, in order to bring lasting peace to the continent, he will also have to embrace his Targareyen heritage \u2026 Because it\u2019s the best way for him to actually be effective against her. I have speculated that Jon will ride a dragon and I\u2019m pretty much convinced that will happen. He will also need to assert his Targareyen heritage in order to ascend the throne of Westeros (which again I think will happen) because the Starks have no right to the throne of the 7 kingdoms but the Targareyens, historically, do. So he will need to do what Robert Baratheon did before him, assert his Targareyen heritage while actively trying to destroy it.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",
                "content": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I do think this scene is very meaningful for Jon and the parentage reveal but what this could foreshadow exactly is less certain, I think.&nbsp;</p><p>The fandom has discussed over and over again and made a very strong case for the fact that Theon is very much a foil for Jon. They&rsquo;re both outsiders within the Stark family and they both want to be Starks but the way they choose to express that desire is in opposite directions. Theon twists himself, becomes embittered, betrays his best friend and wrecks Winterfell. Jon dreams about becoming a Stark honorably, by proving his worth, honoring the legacy of his father and Robb and rebuilding Winterfell. This is why while Theon falls from grace, ends up in a situation where he is tortured and&nbsp;&ldquo;remade&rdquo;, Jon beings getting closer and closer to his deep seethed desire. Because he chose the right way of doing it and because his love for his Stark family supersedes his ambitions.&nbsp;</p><p>So it&rsquo;s no small wonder that at some point in the narrative, they would both be faced with the same dilemma: who am I? Am I a Stark or a Greyjoy? A Stark or a Targareyen? It&rsquo;s also no surprise that they have to choose, or seemingly choose, between being a Stark or a historical enemy of the Starks.

Were she to find out about his title, it would cut deep.\u201d</p><p>At the end of the show\u2019s seventh season, it was finally revealed that Daenerys and Jon are related, while the latter character was also confirmed as the last surviving member of the Targaryen family, making him the true heir to the Iron Throne. </p><p>Discussing this major revelation, Harington reiterated his co-star\u2019s view, adding: \u201cJon is someone who plays by the book.

        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>At this point, I think there\u2019s a chance of anything in this show so I really don\u2019t know how to approach this, to be honest.\u00a0</p><p>My gut reaction is that no, Arya and Sansa don\u2019t know about Jon\u2019s parentage. Bran has known about this since the end of season 6, he\u2019s been in Winterfell for most of season 7 and has this to say:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Bran: He needs to know the truth \u2026 about himself. I\u2019m the only one who knows.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>So Bran understands the importance of this secret and he is actively withholding it from everyone, including Meera, his long suffering companion and his sisters. This does beg the question as to why he offers this information so readily to Sam, a guy he\u2019s met only once before. In terms of plot, it is necessary for Bran to talk to Sam about it because then Sam can connect the dots with what Gilly found. Although Sam doesn\u2019t seem to be paying attention to Gilly at all in that scene so it feels a bit too convenient that as he\u2019s talking to Bran he does recall exactly what she said \u2026 I guess he has a multitasking brain or something \u2026\u00a0</p><p>I keep thinking that there might be a reason why Bran doesn\u2019t tell Arya and, particularly, Sansa about Jon\u2019s parents. Sam is Jon\u2019s best friend and he mentioned just how devoted he is to Jon when he and Bran first met. So I think Bran trusts that Sam won\u2019t misjudge this information in the way that Sansa might \u2026 Also the parentage reveal doesn\u2019t affect Sam directly, whereas it does affect Sansa most of all.\u00a0</p><p>Now, hear me out \u2026 I know we\u2019re all dying for Sansa to find out that Jon is in fact not her brother so we can finally get all that Jonsa loving but there\u2019s a chance that initially the reveal might hit Sansa like a ton of bricks and not in a good way.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s put this into perspective \u2026 By the end of season 7, Jon has blindsided Sansa on 2 separate occasions. When he first got the scroll from Tyrion, Jon asked for Sansa\u2019s opinion and both she and Davos strongly advised against him going to meet D*ny. You can see in the scene where Jon talks to the Northern Lords how she\u2019s nodding along to Jon\u2019s speech because she thinks she knows how it ends. Then Jon, out of the blue, drops the bomb that in fact he has decided to ignore her advise and go to Dragonstone. Sansa is not only taken aback by this, she\u2019s shocked. Because he failed to talk to her about this in advance, which is one of the many frustrations of being around Jon Snow.

        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>This is a very interesting question and while I do not have a definitive answer, I am inclined to say that Benjen did in fact know the truth about Jon. There are two theories about how he found out. One is frankly quite boring and not all that interesting, while the other is much more emotional and meaningful. So I\u2019ll kind of lay out both and you can make up your mind on it yourself.\u00a0</p><p>The first scenario is that he found out once the children of the forest found him and healed him from the wounds inflicted by the White Walker in season 1. What we know about this incident is that the way Benjen was healed by the COF was similar to the creation of the Night King. Since all of this is just show canon at this point, things might be different in the books so keep that in mind.\u00a0</p><p>The story Benjen tells Bran and Meera is that the COF inserted a shard of dragonglass into his heart to stop the process of him dying and turning into a wight. Why the COF would have done that for him and not the rest of the party he was with, remains a mystery but we do know that the NK is imbued with greenseer abilities because he was able to spot Bran while he was warging and actually interact with him by touching him (which lead to the magic of BR\u2019s cave to be destroyed and them being attacked). It\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that Benjen, in his new hybrid state, has now gained access to the weirwood net and is able to have visions of the past, present and future just like Bran. In addition, Benjen is a Stark and we know that most of the Starks are magical in one way or another (although not as powerful as Bran, of course). These 2 things would go a long way in explaining how Benjen was able to pop up at the exact time when Bran and Jon needed rescuing when they were beyond the wall. So it Benjen does in fact have greenseer abilities, he would probably be able to see just how Ned came to find Jon and what lead him to bring him home from the Tower of Joy.\u00a0</p><p>The other theory, and the one I\u2019m most partial too, is that Benjen knew all along that Jon was Lyanna\u2019s son. Some people speculate that Ned told him after bringing Jon home as, unlike Cat, Benjen had a vested interest in protecting his sister\u2019s son. But I don\u2019t think Ned needed to tell Benjen for him to figure it out all on his own.\u00a0</p><p>One of the most interesting aspects about Benjen, and one the books highlight far more than the show, is his extremely close relationship with Lyanna. They were closer in age and Benjen was Lyanna\u2019s wingman, so to speak, all through their childhood and adolescence.\u00a0</p><p>I always found it fascinating that one of the visions Bran has the first time he accesses the weirwood net is of Lyanna and Benjen playing in the godswood. While there might be other narrative reasons for this vision that are, as of yet, unrevealed it does highlight just how close these two were.\u00a0</p><p>Also Benjen was present at the tournament where Rhaegar crowned Lyanna as the Queen of Love and Beauty and since he also helped Howland Reed after he was attacked, it\u2019s very possible that he was the only person to know that Lyanna was the Knight of the Laughing Tree and he helped her in this endeavor. Which would also make it possible that he was there the first time Rhaegar and Lyanna interacted when he tracked them down and revealed their shenanigans.\u00a0</p><p>All of this is speculation at this point, of course, but if everything above happened, it\u2019s also likely that Benjen knew Rhaegar kept in touch with Lyanna and chose to keep his sister\u2019s secret. Unlike his brothers, he might very well have known that Lyanna was not actually kidnapped and that she went with Rhaegar willingly. I doubt either Benjen or Lyanna realized just what a terrible mistake they made in engaging with Rahegar to that level or the consequences of what they might have seen as a innocent, romantic tryst would have.\u00a0</p><p>During the rebellion, Benjen was stuck being the Stark in Winterfell and was cut off from communicating with Ned which is why he probably never managed to tell Ned that Lyanna had ran off with Rhaegar of her own accord. Not that this would have stopped the rebellion per se but I imagine Benjen would have been riddled with guilt over his part in all of it, not to mention carry a trauma for aiding Lyanna in what would essentially be a huge tragedy for their family and also lead to her death. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that a few months after Ned returned home, Benjen went to the Wall. I think him joining the NW was his way of atoning for what he saw as his failure to protect his sister and their family. So, knowing all that he knew about Lyanna and Rhaegar, knowing Ned as he did and also seeing how stubborn he was in refusing to ever talk about the mother of his bastard son and seeing just how much Jon looked like Lyanna, I think Benjen figured out fairly quickly just who Jon was. Perhaps he confronted Ned with this and Ned confirmed it. Perhaps he kept it to himself and it was an unspoken thing between the two brothers but I think there\u2019s a very good chance that Benjen knew.\u00a0</p><p>I have to stop here and remark on the double standard that the fandom applies to characters in this series. Sansa is often dragged through the mud as a bully and an idiot for having a difficult relationship with Arya and because of her naivete when it comes to Cersei and Jofferey. Lyanna, however, is always spared such criticism. Although we know that by virtue of being the older sister, she did in fact dominate Benjen and made fun of him: in the vision that Bran has, Lyanna roughs him up and then scolds him for screaming because she\u2019s afraid someone will find out and at the tourney she pours a glass of wine over his head when he makes fun of her crying over Rhaegar playing the harp. And that\u2019s just the canon aspect of their relationship. If the theory above turns out to be true, Lyanna effectively made her little brother complicit in the event that shattered their family. Also, just for the record, while the brunt of the Rhaegar/Lyanna relationship must rest on Rhaegar\u2019s adult shoulders, it\u2019s also worth noting that Lyanna chose to run away with a married man and entertain his advances for months prior. She was most likely groomed and coerced into this but, at the same time, she had ample time to inform her father or older siblings of what Rhaegar was doing and she chose not to, probably because she saw it as a way of getting out of her betrothal to Robert. All of this doesn\u2019t make her an evil person or a monster but the responsibility of what happened is greater in her case then whatever role Sansa is supposed to have played in Ned\u2019s downfall (which is minimal if not, downright inexistent) or the tragedy that she falls victim to after her father\u2019s death. But because Lyanna is known to have swung a sword at some point, she\u2019s Jon\u2019s mother and also reminds fans of Arya, she get\u2019s a free pass. Sansa, on the other hand, must suffer for the rest of her life because she was an innocent little girl who was taught to trust the adults around her and did just that.\u00a0</p><p>Coming back to the topic at hand \u2026 It\u2019s also interesting that Benjen is at once willing to let Jon join the NW but at the same time tries to talk him out of it. He\u2019s conflicted about Jon\u2019s decision. He tells Jon this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Benjen: You don\u2019t understand what you might be giving up. None of us will ever father sons.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: I don\u2019t care about that.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Benjen: You might. If you knew what it meant.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Now, on the surface this feels like Benjen finding Jon\u2019s inexperience in matters of sex endearing. But \u2026 I always got the feeling that Benjen was referring to more than that. After all, why say none of them will have children and not point out that Jon might at least try to have sex before joining a celibate order for life? I think he was in fact unsure whether to take Jon to the Wall because by joining the NW Jon would be making a life altering decision without being in possession of all the facts concerning who he was and what his actual place in the world could be.\u00a0</p><p>This theory is supported, in my mind, by Ned and Jon\u2019s last conversation:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Jon: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I\u2019m going? Does she care?\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ned: The next time we see each other, we\u2019ll talk about your mother. I promise.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Firstly, please allow me to retreat in a dark corner and cry. Poor Jon! I get very defensive of him when people label him entitled or a bully because of his inability to understand the plight of Pyp and Grenn when he gets to the wall, because even though Pyp and Grenn go through hardships, Jon\u2019s life has not been a walk in the park. Living in a castle and having access to a sword master shouldn\u2019t blind people from the very real and painful traumas that have plagued Jon since the moment he was born.\u00a0</p><p>Now, going back to the quote \u2026\u00a0 Ned is a man of his word. I truly believe that he had every intention of telling Jon about Lyanna and his true parentage once they\u00a0\u201csaw each other\u201d again. The question is why now? Why keep a secret for so long and promise to tell Jon the truth? What changes?\u00a0</p><p>The only answer I can come up with is that by the time Ned and Jon would see each other again, Jon would have taken his NW oath which would not only mean that Jon was out of the reach of Robert but also that he would be now stuck there, unable to do anything with this new information. So Ned is biding his time until that happens so that Jon would have no choice but continue to be the Bastard of Winterfell. And Benjen is aiding him in this.\u00a0</p><p>This feels like the kind of thing GRRM would come up with since it adds to the bittersweet aspect of the Jon/Ned/Benjen relationship. Both these men protect and love Jon but they also fail him by keeping him in the dark about who he is and standing by while Jon condemns himself to a life of celibacy, in a place that will most likely kill him because he sees no other road open to him in life.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

I think he was in fact unsure whether to take Jon to the Wall because by joining the NW Jon would be making a life altering decision without being in possession of all the facts concerning who he was and what his actual place in the world could be.\u00a0</p><p>This theory is supported, in my mind, by Ned and Jon\u2019s last conversation:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Jon: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I\u2019m going? Does she care?\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ned: The next time we see each other, we\u2019ll talk about your mother. I promise.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Firstly, please allow me to retreat in a dark corner and cry. Poor Jon! I get very defensive of him when people label him entitled or a bully because of his inability to understand the plight of Pyp and Grenn when he gets to the wall, because even though Pyp and Grenn go through hardships, Jon\u2019s life has not been a walk in the park. Living in a castle and having access to a sword master shouldn\u2019t blind people from the very real and painful traumas that have plagued Jon since the moment he was born.\u00a0</p><p>Now, going back to the quote \u2026\u00a0 Ned is a man of his word. I truly believe that he had every intention of telling Jon about Lyanna and his true parentage once they\u00a0\u201csaw each other\u201d again. The question is why now? Why keep a secret for so long and promise to tell Jon the truth? What changes?\u00a0</p><p>The only answer I can come up with is that by the time Ned and Jon would see each other again, Jon would have taken his NW oath which would not only mean that Jon was out of the reach of Robert but also that he would be now stuck there, unable to do anything with this new information. So Ned is biding his time until that happens so that Jon would have no choice but continue to be the Bastard of Winterfell. And Benjen is aiding him in this.\u00a0</p><p>This feels like the kind of thing GRRM would come up with since it adds to the bittersweet aspect of the Jon/Ned/Benjen relationship. Both these men protect and love Jon but they also fail him by keeping him in the dark about who he is and standing by while Jon condemns himself to a life of celibacy, in a place that will most likely kill him because he sees no other road open to him in life.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>This is a very interesting question and while I do not have a definitive answer, I am inclined to say that Benjen did in fact know the truth about Jon. There are two theories about how he found out. One is frankly quite boring and not all that interesting, while the other is much more emotional and meaningful. So I\u2019ll kind of lay out both and you can make up your mind on it yourself.\u00a0</p><p>The first scenario is that he found out once the children of the forest found him and healed him from the wounds inflicted by the White Walker in season 1. What we know about this incident is that the way Benjen was healed by the COF was similar to the creation of the Night King. Since all of this is just show canon at this point, things might be different in the books so keep that in mind.\u00a0</p><p>The story Benjen tells Bran and Meera is that the COF inserted a shard of dragonglass into his heart to stop the process of him dying and turning into a wight. Why the COF would have done that for him and not the rest of the party he was with, remains a mystery but we do know that the NK is imbued with greenseer abilities because he was able to spot Bran while he was warging and actually interact with him by touching him (which lead to the magic of BR\u2019s cave to be destroyed and them being attacked). It\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that Benjen, in his new hybrid state, has now gained access to the weirwood net and is able to have visions of the past, present and future just like Bran. In addition, Benjen is a Stark and we know that most of the Starks are magical in one way or another (although not as powerful as Bran, of course). These 2 things would go a long way in explaining how Benjen was able to pop up at the exact time when Bran and Jon needed rescuing when they were beyond the wall. So it Benjen does in fact have greenseer abilities, he would probably be able to see just how Ned came to find Jon and what lead him to bring him home from the Tower of Joy.\u00a0</p><p>The other theory, and the one I\u2019m most partial too, is that Benjen knew all along that Jon was Lyanna\u2019s son. Some people speculate that Ned told him after bringing Jon home as, unlike Cat, Benjen had a vested interest in protecting his sister\u2019s son. But I don\u2019t think Ned needed to tell Benjen for him to figure it out all on his own.\u00a0</p><p>One of the most interesting aspects about Benjen, and one the books highlight far more than the show, is his extremely close relationship with Lyanna. They were closer in age and Benjen was Lyanna\u2019s wingman, so to speak, all through their childhood and adolescence.\u00a0</p><p>I always found it fascinating that one of the visions Bran has the first time he accesses the weirwood net is of Lyanna and Benjen playing in the godswood. While there might be other narrative reasons for this vision that are, as of yet, unrevealed it does highlight just how close these two were.\u00a0</p><p>Also Benjen was present at the tournament where Rhaegar crowned Lyanna as the Queen of Love and Beauty and since he also helped Howland Reed after he was attacked, it\u2019s very possible that he was the only person to know that Lyanna was the Knight of the Laughing Tree and he helped her in this endeavor. Which would also make it possible that he was there the first time Rhaegar and Lyanna interacted when he tracked them down and revealed their shenanigans.\u00a0</p><p>All of this is speculation at this point, of course, but if everything above happened, it\u2019s also likely that Benjen knew Rhaegar kept in touch with Lyanna and chose to keep his sister\u2019s secret. Unlike his brothers, he might very well have known that Lyanna was not actually kidnapped and that she went with Rhaegar willingly. I doubt either Benjen or Lyanna realized just what a terrible mistake they made in engaging with Rahegar to that level or the consequences of what they might have seen as a innocent, romantic tryst would have.\u00a0</p><p>During the rebellion, Benjen was stuck being the Stark in Winterfell and was cut off from communicating with Ned which is why he probably never managed to tell Ned that Lyanna had ran off with Rhaegar of her own accord. Not that this would have stopped the rebellion per se but I imagine Benjen would have been riddled with guilt over his part in all of it, not to mention carry a trauma for aiding Lyanna in what would essentially be a huge tragedy for their family and also lead to her death. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that a few months after Ned returned home, Benjen went to the Wall. I think him joining the NW was his way of atoning for what he saw as his failure to protect his sister and their family. So, knowing all that he knew about Lyanna and Rhaegar, knowing Ned as he did and also seeing how stubborn he was in refusing to ever talk about the mother of his bastard son and seeing just how much Jon looked like Lyanna, I think Benjen figured out fairly quickly just who Jon was. Perhaps he confronted Ned with this and Ned confirmed it. Perhaps he kept it to himself and it was an unspoken thing between the two brothers but I think there\u2019s a very good chance that Benjen knew.\u00a0</p><p>I have to stop here and remark on the double standard that the fandom applies to characters in this series. Sansa is often dragged through the mud as a bully and an idiot for having a difficult relationship with Arya and because of her naivete when it comes to Cersei and Jofferey. Lyanna, however, is always spared such criticism. Although we know that by virtue of being the older sister, she did in fact dominate Benjen and made fun of him: in the vision that Bran has, Lyanna roughs him up and then scolds him for screaming because she\u2019s afraid someone will find out and at the tourney she pours a glass of wine over his head when he makes fun of her crying over Rhaegar playing the harp. And that\u2019s just the canon aspect of their relationship. If the theory above turns out to be true, Lyanna effectively made her little brother complicit in the event that shattered their family. Also, just for the record, while the brunt of the Rhaegar/Lyanna relationship must rest on Rhaegar\u2019s adult shoulders, it\u2019s also worth noting that Lyanna chose to run away with a married man and entertain his advances for months prior. She was most likely groomed and coerced into this but, at the same time, she had ample time to inform her father or older siblings of what Rhaegar was doing and she chose not to, probably because she saw it as a way of getting out of her betrothal to Robert. All of this doesn\u2019t make her an evil person or a monster but the responsibility of what happened is greater in her case then whatever role Sansa is supposed to have played in Ned\u2019s downfall (which is minimal if not, downright inexistent) or the tragedy that she falls victim to after her father\u2019s death. But because Lyanna is known to have swung a sword at some point, she\u2019s Jon\u2019s mother and also reminds fans of Arya, she get\u2019s a free pass. Sansa, on the other hand, must suffer for the rest of her life because she was an innocent little girl who was taught to trust the adults around her and did just that.\u00a0</p><p>Coming back to the topic at hand \u2026 It\u2019s also interesting that Benjen is at once willing to let Jon join the NW but at the same time tries to talk him out of it. He\u2019s conflicted about Jon\u2019s decision. He tells Jon this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Benjen: You don\u2019t understand what you might be giving up. None of us will ever father sons.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: I don\u2019t care about that.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Benjen: You might. If you knew what it meant.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Now, on the surface this feels like Benjen finding Jon\u2019s inexperience in matters of sex endearing. But \u2026 I always got the feeling that Benjen was referring to more than that. After all, why say none of them will have children and not point out that Jon might at least try to have sex before joining a celibate order for life? I think he was in fact unsure whether to take Jon to the Wall because by joining the NW Jon would be making a life altering decision without being in possession of all the facts concerning who he was and what his actual place in the world could be.\u00a0</p><p>This theory is supported, in my mind, by Ned and Jon\u2019s last conversation:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Jon: Is my mother alive?
