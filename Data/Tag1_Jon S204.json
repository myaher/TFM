Maybe he would frown his eyes when he saw her, standing here in front of his door at this unholy time. Maybe he would send her away, politely as only Jon Snow could do, not knowing that by doing so he would break her barely healed heart.</p>\n<p>The door squeaked when he opened it, the long travel clearly hearable, and she looked up at Jon Snow, wearing nothing but his pants and a white shirt, all of a sudden not knowing what to say.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it seemed that words weren\u2019t need to tell him what she wanted. Their eyes met and reluctantly she curled a hand around his neck and leaned towards him. She gave him the time to pull back, to gently push her away, but he didn\u2019t do so.</p>\n<p>Instead he leaned in and his warm breath touched her nose before he gently kissed her slightly parted lips. His hands wandered over her back, lower and lower, pulling her dress up and up until his hands touched nothing but her naked skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She used her body to guide him towards his bed while her lips never lost touch with his. A burning heat spread through her veins and she opened her mouth to allow their tongues to meet and play. Her hands pulled his white shirt over his head and she fought the urge to do this quickly, to give in to the fire claiming her completely. She wanted to enjoy this. She wanted to do this slowly and tenderly and lovingly. And she wanted it to last. As long as possible, until their ship would reach White Harbor and then night after night again.</p>",

Will be the same for the show. The thing about Tyrion is starting to convince me that, no matter the turns they took with some characters vs their book counterparts, (or whitewashing out the darker shades of grey when it comes to some of these characters), the show versions are going to moved into their book counterparts positions (whatever they are supposed to be) for the endgame.</p><p><b>Possible S8 Spoilers Below!</b> Read at your own risk.</p><p>So yeah, I read the spoiler about Tyrion betraying the Starks, being put on trial and being executed for it. And while I&rsquo;m not sure on the <i>why</i> or <i>what</i> when it comes to the betrayal part of the spoiler, I think there will be one of some sort, and Tyrion will be executed for it.&nbsp;</p><p>GRRMs original notes said the love triangle will turn <i>deadly</i> between Jon and Tyrion.

Taking out some of Tyrion&rsquo;s darker moments from the book will likely make it a really bitter pill to swallow for a lot of people I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>I actually hope D&amp;D don&rsquo;t get too much blame for the&nbsp;&ldquo;Tyrion is in love with Dany&rdquo; thing the Vanity Fair article confirmed from the Season 6 and Season 7 scripts. Because I don&rsquo;t think that is their doing at all. I think that is straight up a George R. R. Martin thing full stop, and it&rsquo;s going to happen in the books too.</p>\n<p>GRRMs original outline for the series had Tyrion falling in love with Arya - and it being unrequited - leading to a Jon / Arya / Tyrion love triangle. It seems clear to me that GRRM changed it to now have Dany in Arya&rsquo;s place instead. (BTW, I don&rsquo;t think it was a late-change either. I think it was something he figured out and changed during the writing of the first book).</p>\n<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m becoming more and more convinced that, though some things got expanded and some things/characters got changed around a bit, the bigger, overall points from Martin&rsquo;s outline are still in play. The core five characters he mentioned in the original outline (Dany, Tyrion, Bran, Arya and Jon) are <i>still </i>the same core five characters in the book AND on the show. (Some of the more recent promos, especially the recap ones, have those five in them all the time, and sometimes in highlighted ways).</p>\n<p>And whatever Martin&rsquo;s endgame is for the books (if he ever finishes them)? Will be the same for the show. The thing about Tyrion is starting to convince me that, no matter the turns they took with some characters vs their book counterparts, (or whitewashing out the darker shades of grey when it comes to some of these characters), the show versions are going to moved into their book counterparts positions (whatever they are supposed to be) for the endgame.</p>\n<p><b>Possible S8 Spoilers Below!</b> Read at your own risk.</p>\n</p>",
