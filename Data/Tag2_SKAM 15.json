The way his head fell back as he laughed at something Idriss was saying. The way he absentmindedly ran his long fingers through his hair. </p><p>Holy fuck did he want Idriss and Yann and everyone else to leave so he could sink to his knees and worship Eliott\u2019s dick. </p><p>Eliott caught his eye just then and quirked his eyebrow at Lucas\u2019 expression. All Lucas could do was stare back, not so subtly sinking his teeth into his lower lip, letting Eliott know exactly what he was thinking about. </p><p>It took them all of 15 minutes to kick everyone out. 15 seconds for Lucas to push Eliott down on the couch. And another 20 seconds for Lucas to get Eliott\u2019s pants down so he could finally FINALLY lick his way down that deliciously musky dick. </p><p>So yeah.</p><p>Their first night living together was a lot of great sex. </p>",

Axel Auriant, we know each other, you already came.</p><p>Axel : Exactly.</p><p>J : Welcome back. Assa Sylla, welcome, and Philippine Stindel (he butchered her name a bit skdkdkdk), welcome. And, you&rsquo;re three of Skam&rsquo;s actors, David Hourregue you&rsquo;re the director of Skam, of the show airing on the platform France TV Slash, it&rsquo;s France TV&rsquo;s platform.</p><p>D : Exactly.</p><p>J : Is that it? Explain Skam to people who know nothing about it.</p><p>D : Skam tells the daily life of high schoolers. Of high schoolers in seconde (first year of high school) and premi\u00e8re (second year of high school) during seasons 3 and 4, and has the particularity of airing in real time.</p><p>J : How is it airing?</p><p>D : So, there&rsquo;s clearly the episode, if you want to binge watch it there&rsquo;s the episode at the end of the week</p><p>J : If you want to&hellip; ? (poor old dude is so lost)</p><p>D : Binge watch it. Hi sir.</p><p>J : No but for people who don&rsquo;t know, I know.</p><p>D : You know.</p><p>J : Some people don&rsquo;t</p><p>D : There&rsquo;s the full episode airing at the end of the week like a classical TV show, on fridays at 6pm on Slash, but you can also decide to live another experience, that is to say to live each clip, each part, airing at the hour where it&rsquo;s supposed to happen in the week. An example-</p><p>J : Yes, for example, if&hellip;. A lunch on thursday is going to be at 1pm on thursday.</p><p>D : At 1pm, if they plan to meet on friday for a, for a party or a date, we can be sure that at 7 or 8 pm, all of the audience is online, hoping the meeting will happen and when is it going to drop, what is gonna go down, and how we&rsquo;re gonna- (they know we&rsquo;re clowns they really do)</p><p>Other journalist : Are they short clips? How long are the clips?</p><p>D : It&rsquo;s variable. Actually a clip can last 50 seconds or 8 minutes for example.</p><p>OJ : So you have to follow</p><p>D : You have to follow, knowing that it&rsquo;s never announced. You don&rsquo;t have any notification to tell you &ldquo;it is now&rdquo;, you never know when it&rsquo;s gonna drop beforehand, and&hellip;</p><p>Third Journalist : And how is it going, how do you know?</p><p>J : On social media</p><p>D : Exactly</p><p>J : Makes us look young, to ask for this [laughs] . They all have their instagram accounts. They all have an account, the characters&rsquo; account, and so there are two issues. One, addiction (i won&rsquo;t be attacked like that sir), we say that some young people are completely drugged on skam, and two, teachers can&rsquo;t anymore, especially when an episode is supposed to happen at uh&hellip; two to eight.</p><p>D : We got messages from teachers. Asking us, &ldquo;please, next week there&rsquo;s an exam at x hour, try not to drop a clip at 7h56&rdquo;. So that&rsquo;s quite&hellip;</p><p>J : So you have your characters account, in fact. (he really is lost someone who has actually seen the show help him)</p><p>Assa : Exactly</p><p>J : But, are you the ones behing them? Or are there&hellip;</p><p>Axel : Not at all. No, no, there are community managers who are doing that way better than us, in my opinion. And especially, you have to be connected at the same time as the plot happens, at the same time as the episodes are airing, so sometimes you have to post at 11pm, etc, so we&rsquo;re not always on social media.</p><p>[they all laugh and i think they&rsquo;re teasing him cause 11pm is early for him?]</p><p>J : Are you gonna disspoint people or do the fans know? (dude we&rsquo;re not stupid) [Axel looking confused]</p><p>P : Ah no they know I think.</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>P : Well yeah</p><p>J : Who has the most followers?</p><p>Assa : Axel I think</p><p>P : Yeah Axel yeah</p><p>Axel : I think it is- No it&rsquo;s Lucas, I think.</p><p>J : Yeah you have to diff\u00e9renciate. What does Skam mean?</p><p>D : Shame, in norwegian.</p><p>J : Why norwegian? </p><p>D : Uh&hellip; Cause it&rsquo;s the remake of a norwegian TV show, who was a true triumph there. It started slowly, nicely, before completely exploding at the end of season 2. And, basically, there, I think 2/3 of norwegian people have seen the show, that&rsquo;s absolutely huge.</p><p>J : So what are the themes? I can remember sexuality, want to be cool, desire to be integrated, what else?</p><p>Assa : Religion, for season 4.</p><p>Axel : Bullying- actually what&rsquo;s very strong and allows a lot of young people to relate is that Skam uses the codes of today&rsquo;s youth in that society, and for every problem we can&hellip; Well, being a teenager is a very carnal/pivotal (the two words are similar in french and he mixed up both) moment, where&hellip;</p><p>J : Carnal</p><p>Axel : Yeah, carnal too, exactly, as we can see in the paint, but uh&hellip; That&rsquo;s the strenght of Skam, it&rsquo;s that in one plot you can find, for example in Lucas&rsquo; storyline - I&rsquo;m talking about my character - we can find the discovery of his sexuality, at least at that very moment of his life, bullying, every societal norm he suddenly faces, and that&rsquo;s the strength of Skam, it&rsquo;s to see a bunch of teens  revealing themselves and supporting each others during that carnal and pivotal period.</p><p>J : We have been talking about it for two minutes, but now we&rsquo;re gonna see an extract, with you [he points at Axel]</p><p>[it&rsquo;s the clip where Lucas leaves the church looking for Eliott with all the flashbacks]</p><p>J : So that&rsquo;s you Axel. Assa, your character, if you had to describe it in a few words?</p><p>Assa : So, Imane&rsquo;s character is a young woman - well young girl, black, Muslim, hijabi. She tries to live her youth while keeping her faith, her principles, her values. And she also embodies all possible forms of discrimination. Be it religious, physical discriminations&hellip; </p><p>P : About women</p><p>A : About women&hellip; And yeah.</p><p>J : We&rsquo;re watching an extract with you.</p><p>[last clip of s4 when she explains to Sofiane their relationship would be very difficult because religion is so important in her life, and her family, her muslim friends&hellip;]</p><p>J : Philippine that&rsquo;s your turn, your character?</p><p>P : We&rsquo;re gonna say&hellip; Uh, a bit wild. She enjoys a good time (literally &ldquo;une bonne vivante&rdquo; = &ldquo;a good liver&rdquo;)</p><p>J : Wild, enjoying a good time.</p><p>P : That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>J : That&rsquo;s it? Can we watch an extract?</p><p>P : Yeah</p><p>[it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;you look like a slut&rdquo; part at the party with Ingrid]</p><p>J : Am I wrong or, when you talk about it or even when you look at the images we feel that you feel a certain pride about embodying these characters?</p><p>Assa : So much. Really, I&rsquo;m so&hellip; I&rsquo;m very very proud, really, extremely proud to be a part of this project, to&hellip;</p><p>J : And are you part of the writing of the script? For example?</p><p>[David nods]</p><p>A : For season 4?</p><p>J : He [David] is saying yes. He&rsquo;s nodding</p><p>[laughs]</p><p>Assa : Well for season 4-</p><p>J : Who got involved in the script writing?</p><p>D : From the start, we don&rsquo;t build the script opposed to our actors&rsquo; energy.</p><p>J : Okay</p><p>D : Skam is of an appalling rhythm during the shooting, and I have to play a little with what they are. And the faster I&rsquo;m getting closer to what they are and feel, the faster we&rsquo;re impactful and close to the truth. I think that&rsquo;s what the audience feels.</p><p>J : And did you take part in the script, Axel and Philippine?</p><p>P : Well, more or less yeah, while talking with David and all that, yeah we might have sometimes given him ideas.</p><p>J : Axel?</p><p>Axel : Me too, there&rsquo;s a piano scene, it&rsquo;s true that&hellip; I had just bought a piano and i told David-</p><p>J : I wanna play piano</p><p>Axel : Exactly, and he integrated&hellip;</p><p>J : And no drums?</p><p>Axel : No. So&hellip; Why no drums David?</p><p>D : Too simple</p><p>J : David, apparently sometimes you felt a bit overwhelmed by the width of the phenomenon.</p><p>D : Of course, cause you never prepare a TV show imagining the phenomenon it&rsquo;s going to produce. All that we tried to do, and I&rsquo;m really including my cast in that, it&rsquo;s to answer it, not playing deaf about all of the messages that we received. It was, that was really impressive. We really felt from one day to another a sort of-</p><p>J : What are the fans telling you?</p><p>D : &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t feel alone anymore&rdquo;.</p><p>J : Do they tell you that too? [to the actors i guess]</p><p>Axel : That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s shattering/deeply moving, it&rsquo;s too see- Because when we&rsquo;re shooting, we&rsquo;re trying to live the closest we can to these characters, but it&rsquo;s to a fictional scale, and to see all of a sudden the impact that the story can have on people, it&rsquo;s true that we&rsquo;re very lucky. I counted 2800 letters at home, I&rsquo;m trying to read and answer everything (and that&rsquo;s the boy that&rsquo;s recently been bashed so bad he had to leave twitter&hellip;&hellip;.. go off i guess). But it&rsquo;s deeply moving to see how much this story can help people to accept themselves, to accept who they are at that point of their lives, and not necessarily - Lucas&rsquo; character for example discovers all of a sudden that he likes men, but it&rsquo;s beautiful to see friends that say &ldquo;yes actually, I&rsquo;m realizing that I may have judged my friend a bit fast, maybe I even throw insults at them&rdquo;, things you say to joke but hay can actually hurt and really do harm when you&rsquo;re trying to build yourself. So it&rsquo;s deeply moving for us and we- Well for me at least I&rsquo;m becoming way less stupid with Skam, because I understood a lot of things and I met young people, I was able to understand what they&rsquo;re living today, it&rsquo;s deeply moving. I&rsquo;m saying that as if I was 25, while I&rsquo;m-</p><p>J : Assa, what kind of letters, of words, did you receive?</p><p>Assa : I&rsquo;m getting a lot of messages from young girls thanking me. &ldquo;Thank you to finally represent us on tv&rdquo;, &ldquo;thank you cause I finally understand young muslim girls wearing the hijab&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s very beautiful, that&rsquo;s really beautiful to get messages like this, to see that well, it touches a huge amount of girls and even boys! Which surprised me a lot. Yeah. And, not only black or muslim girls, just simply young girls relating to Imane&rsquo;s character.</p><p>J : Were there already hijabi fictional characters? Main characters in a TV show?</p><p>D : Well we searched a lot. And sadly we didn&rsquo;t find any. In France, she&rsquo;s the first one.</p><p>J : You&rsquo;re the first one Assa.</p><p>D : We had to work a lot too so she would understand, that despite all of the inevitable symbolic aspect, we were telling Imane&rsquo;s story. Because very clearly, there&rsquo;s such a huge expectation, we&rsquo;re talking about a phenomenon. There are no more TV shows dedicated to young people, currently. We went through 10 or 15 years with a terrible shortage of shows dedicated to young people that really speak to them. And that&rsquo;s true that very very fast, we had to make Assa understand - she didn&rsquo;t really need it - the importance of that moment, which was going to be season 4, while telling her &ldquo;okay, you&rsquo;re telling the story of only one young woman. We can never make everyone happy, but let&rsquo;s tell it the closest of what you lived, and we should touch quite many hearts.&rdquo;</p><p>OJ : And, are there themes you refuse to deal with? Because we see religion, sexuality&hellip; There&rsquo;s everything but is there a theme where you told yourself &ldquo;no, we&rsquo;re not going there&rdquo;?</p><p>D : We&rsquo;re expected on this, and I&rsquo;m including my authors of course, lead by Niels Rahou, the head writer. Actually, there&rsquo;s real expectations from our audience that precisely, we don&rsquo;t keep ourselves away from a lot of things. Of course, everyone warned us when we were about to start season 4, saying &ldquo;are you really sure&rdquo;. I remember a talk in the bus in between Imane and Sofiane, where she talks about her love for Allah, about her religion and how it makes her feel like a better person, and she faces Lais, Sofiane played by Lais Salameh who&rsquo;s a believer in life, who explains her dogmes and everything, he thinks it breaks people apart, he doesn&rsquo;t believe in it, and i remember when we were filming that part, my perchman who was looking at this and telling me &ldquo;are we really&hellip; shooting this right now?&rdquo;. There was a fear, but there&rsquo;s such a need that we feel through the messages we receive.

            "comment": "<p><h1>assa, philippine, axel and david in the french show \u201cquotidien\u201d (13/06) even tho it\u2019s so long I don\u2019t even know if anyone\u2019s gonna read it </h1><p>Journalist : Good evening to the four of you, welcome. Axel Auriant, we know each other, you already came.</p><p>Axel : Exactly.</p><p>J : Welcome back. Assa Sylla, welcome, and Philippine Stindel (he butchered her name a bit skdkdkdk), welcome. And, you\u2019re three of Skam\u2019s actors, David Hourregue you\u2019re the director of Skam, of the show airing on the platform France TV Slash, it\u2019s France TV\u2019s platform.</p><p>D : Exactly.</p><p>J : Is that it? Explain Skam to people who know nothing about it.</p><p>D : Skam tells the daily life of high schoolers. Of high schoolers in seconde (first year of high school) and premi\u00e8re (second year of high school) during seasons 3 and 4, and has the particularity of airing in real time.</p><p>J : How is it airing?</p><p>D : So, there\u2019s clearly the episode, if you want to binge watch it there\u2019s the episode at the end of the week</p><p>J : If you want to\u2026 ? (poor old dude is so lost)</p><p>D : Binge watch it. Hi sir.</p><p>J : No but for people who don\u2019t know, I know.</p><p>D : You know.</p><p>J : Some people don\u2019t</p><p>D : There\u2019s the full episode airing at the end of the week like a classical TV show, on fridays at 6pm on Slash, but you can also decide to live another experience, that is to say to live each clip, each part, airing at the hour where it\u2019s supposed to happen in the week. An example-</p><p>J : Yes, for example, if\u2026. A lunch on thursday is going to be at 1pm on thursday.</p><p>D : At 1pm, if they plan to meet on friday for a, for a party or a date, we can be sure that at 7 or 8 pm, all of the audience is online, hoping the meeting will happen and when is it going to drop, what is gonna go down, and how we\u2019re gonna- (they know we\u2019re clowns they really do)</p><p>Other journalist : Are they short clips? How long are the clips?</p><p>D : It\u2019s variable. Actually a clip can last 50 seconds or 8 minutes for example.</p><p>OJ : So you have to follow</p><p>D : You have to follow, knowing that it\u2019s never announced. You don\u2019t have any notification to tell you \u201cit is now\u201d, you never know when it\u2019s gonna drop beforehand, and\u2026</p><p>Third Journalist : And how is it going, how do you know?</p><p>J : On social media</p><p>D : Exactly</p><p>J : Makes us look young, to ask for this [laughs] . They all have their instagram accounts. They all have an account, the characters\u2019 account, and so there are two issues. One, addiction (i won\u2019t be attacked like that sir), we say that some young people are completely drugged on skam, and two, teachers can\u2019t anymore, especially when an episode is supposed to happen at uh\u2026 two to eight.</p><p>D : We got messages from teachers. Asking us, \u201cplease, next week there\u2019s an exam at x hour, try not to drop a clip at 7h56\u201d. So that\u2019s quite\u2026</p><p>J : So you have your characters account, in fact. (he really is lost someone who has actually seen the show help him)</p><p>Assa : Exactly</p><p>J : But, are you the ones behing them? Or are there\u2026</p><p>Axel : Not at all. No, no, there are community managers who are doing that way better than us, in my opinion. And especially, you have to be connected at the same time as the plot happens, at the same time as the episodes are airing, so sometimes you have to post at 11pm, etc, so we\u2019re not always on social media.</p><p>[they all laugh and i think they\u2019re teasing him cause 11pm is early for him?]</p><p>J : Are you gonna disspoint people or do the fans know? (dude we\u2019re not stupid) [Axel looking confused]</p><p>P : Ah no they know I think.</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>P : Well yeah</p><p>J : Who has the most followers?</p><p>Assa : Axel I think</p><p>P : Yeah Axel yeah</p><p>Axel : I think it is- No it\u2019s Lucas, I think.</p><p>J : Yeah you have to diff\u00e9renciate. What does Skam mean?</p><p>D : Shame, in norwegian.</p><p>J : Why norwegian? </p><p>D : Uh\u2026 Cause it\u2019s the remake of a norwegian TV show, who was a true triumph there. It started slowly, nicely, before completely exploding at the end of season 2. And, basically, there, I think 2/3 of norwegian people have seen the show, that\u2019s absolutely huge.</p><p>J : So what are the themes? I can remember sexuality, want to be cool, desire to be integrated, what else?</p><p>Assa : Religion, for season 4.</p><p>Axel : Bullying- actually what\u2019s very strong and allows a lot of young people to relate is that Skam uses the codes of today\u2019s youth in that society, and for every problem we can\u2026 Well, being a teenager is a very carnal/pivotal (the two words are similar in french and he mixed up both) moment, where\u2026</p><p>J : Carnal</p><p>Axel : Yeah, carnal too, exactly, as we can see in the paint, but uh\u2026 That\u2019s the strenght of Skam, it\u2019s that in one plot you can find, for example in Lucas\u2019 storyline - I\u2019m talking about my character - we can find the discovery of his sexuality, at least at that very moment of his life, bullying, every societal norm he suddenly faces, and that\u2019s the strength of Skam, it\u2019s to see a bunch of teens  revealing themselves and supporting each others during that carnal and pivotal period.</p><p>J : We have been talking about it for two minutes, but now we\u2019re gonna see an extract, with you [he points at Axel]</p><p>[it\u2019s the clip where Lucas leaves the church looking for Eliott with all the flashbacks]</p><p>J : So that\u2019s you Axel. Assa, your character, if you had to describe it in a few words?</p><p>Assa : So, Imane\u2019s character is a young woman - well young girl, black, Muslim, hijabi. She tries to live her youth while keeping her faith, her principles, her values. And she also embodies all possible forms of discrimination. Be it religious, physical discriminations\u2026 </p><p>P : About women</p><p>A : About women\u2026 And yeah.</p><p>J : We\u2019re watching an extract with you.</p><p>[last clip of s4 when she explains to Sofiane their relationship would be very difficult because religion is so important in her life, and her family, her muslim friends\u2026]</p><p>J : Philippine that\u2019s your turn, your character?</p><p>P : We\u2019re gonna say\u2026 Uh, a bit wild. She enjoys a good time (literally \u201cune bonne vivante\u201d = \u201ca good liver\u201d)</p><p>J : Wild, enjoying a good time.</p><p>P : That\u2019s it.</p><p>J : That\u2019s it? Can we watch an extract?</p><p>P : Yeah</p><p>[it\u2019s the \u201cyou look like a slut\u201d part at the party with Ingrid]</p><p>J : Am I wrong or, when you talk about it or even when you look at the images we feel that you feel a certain pride about embodying these characters?</p><p>Assa : So much. Really, I\u2019m so\u2026 I\u2019m very very proud, really, extremely proud to be a part of this project, to\u2026</p><p>J : And are you part of the writing of the script? For example?</p><p>[David nods]</p><p>A : For season 4?</p><p>J : He [David] is saying yes. He\u2019s nodding</p><p>[laughs]</p><p>Assa : Well for season 4-</p><p>J : Who got involved in the script writing?</p><p>D : From the start, we don\u2019t build the script opposed to our actors\u2019 energy.</p><p>J : Okay</p><p>D : Skam is of an appalling rhythm during the shooting, and I have to play a little with what they are. And the faster I\u2019m getting closer to what they are and feel, the faster we\u2019re impactful and close to the truth. I think that\u2019s what the audience feels.</p><p>J : And did you take part in the script, Axel and Philippine?</p><p>P : Well, more or less yeah, while talking with David and all that, yeah we might have sometimes given him ideas.</p><p>J : Axel?</p><p>Axel : Me too, there\u2019s a piano scene, it\u2019s true that\u2026 I had just bought a piano and i told David-</p><p>J : I wanna play piano</p><p>Axel : Exactly, and he integrated\u2026</p><p>J : And no drums?</p><p>Axel : No. So\u2026 Why no drums David?</p><p>D : Too simple</p><p>J : David, apparently sometimes you felt a bit overwhelmed by the width of the phenomenon.</p><p>D : Of course, cause you never prepare a TV show imagining the phenomenon it\u2019s going to produce. All that we tried to do, and I\u2019m really including my cast in that, it\u2019s to answer it, not playing deaf about all of the messages that we received. It was, that was really impressive. We really felt from one day to another a sort of-</p><p>J : What are the fans telling you?</p><p>D : \u201cWe don\u2019t feel alone anymore\u201d.</p><p>J : Do they tell you that too? [to the actors i guess]</p><p>Axel : That\u2019s what\u2019s shattering/deeply moving, it\u2019s too see- Because when we\u2019re shooting, we\u2019re trying to live the closest we can to these characters, but it\u2019s to a fictional scale, and to see all of a sudden the impact that the story can have on people, it\u2019s true that we\u2019re very lucky. I counted 2800 letters at home, I\u2019m trying to read and answer everything (and that\u2019s the boy that\u2019s recently been bashed so bad he had to leave twitter\u2026\u2026.. go off i guess). But it\u2019s deeply moving to see how much this story can help people to accept themselves, to accept who they are at that point of their lives, and not necessarily - Lucas\u2019 character for example discovers all of a sudden that he likes men, but it\u2019s beautiful to see friends that say \u201cyes actually, I\u2019m realizing that I may have judged my friend a bit fast, maybe I even throw insults at them\u201d, things you say to joke but hay can actually hurt and really do harm when you\u2019re trying to build yourself. So it\u2019s deeply moving for us and we- Well for me at least I\u2019m becoming way less stupid with Skam, because I understood a lot of things and I met young people, I was able to understand what they\u2019re living today, it\u2019s deeply moving. I\u2019m saying that as if I was 25, while I\u2019m-</p><p>J : Assa, what kind of letters, of words, did you receive?</p><p>Assa : I\u2019m getting a lot of messages from young girls thanking me. \u201cThank you to finally represent us on tv\u201d, \u201cthank you cause I finally understand young muslim girls wearing the hijab\u201d, and that\u2019s very beautiful, that\u2019s really beautiful to get messages like this, to see that well, it touches a huge amount of girls and even boys! Which surprised me a lot. Yeah. And, not only black or muslim girls, just simply young girls relating to Imane\u2019s character.</p><p>J : Were there already hijabi fictional characters? Main characters in a TV show?</p><p>D : Well we searched a lot. And sadly we didn\u2019t find any. In France, she\u2019s the first one.</p><p>J : You\u2019re the first one Assa.</p><p>D : We had to work a lot too so she would understand, that despite all of the inevitable symbolic aspect, we were telling Imane\u2019s story. Because very clearly, there\u2019s such a huge expectation, we\u2019re talking about a phenomenon. There are no more TV shows dedicated to young people, currently. We went through 10 or 15 years with a terrible shortage of shows dedicated to young people that really speak to them. And that\u2019s true that very very fast, we had to make Assa understand - she didn\u2019t really need it - the importance of that moment, which was going to be season 4, while telling her \u201cokay, you\u2019re telling the story of only one young woman. We can never make everyone happy, but let\u2019s tell it the closest of what you lived, and we should touch quite many hearts.\u201d</p><p>OJ : And, are there themes you refuse to deal with? Because we see religion, sexuality\u2026 There\u2019s everything but is there a theme where you told yourself \u201cno, we\u2019re not going there\u201d?</p><p>D : We\u2019re expected on this, and I\u2019m including my authors of course, lead by Niels Rahou, the head writer. Actually, there\u2019s real expectations from our audience that precisely, we don\u2019t keep ourselves away from a lot of things. Of course, everyone warned us when we were about to start season 4, saying \u201care you really sure\u201d. I remember a talk in the bus in between Imane and Sofiane, where she talks about her love for Allah, about her religion and how it makes her feel like a better person, and she faces Lais, Sofiane played by Lais Salameh who\u2019s a believer in life, who explains her dogmes and everything, he thinks it breaks people apart, he doesn\u2019t believe in it, and i remember when we were filming that part, my perchman who was looking at this and telling me \u201care we really\u2026 shooting this right now?\u201d. There was a fear, but there\u2019s such a need that we feel through the messages we receive. If you knew the amount of messages, of topics that they hope we\u2019ll touch on through the show.</p><p>TJ : And what themes, precisely? What themes are coming back, are asked for?</p><p>D : Everything\u2026 Season 3 triggered a sort of earthquake, at least that\u2019s a bit how we lived it, of people who absolutely wanted us to talk about them and about their right not to know, at 17. We\u2019re at the time of Parcoursup (a french internet platform where you apply for uni after your last high school year), you\u2019re asked to know exactly what you want to do really fast. To say : \u201cI have the right not to know if I\u2019m straight, gay, bi, pan\u201d, well it\u2019s going everywhere, and it\u2019s true that now I face so many young people at screenings telling me \u201chere, I\u2019m trans, and I would love it if there was a trans character\u201d. And Skam only repeats a damned evidence that we had forgotten, it\u2019s the importance of representation. We\u2019re all very happy to see, me included, that 10 millions of people are watching girls play football, because we tell ourselves \u201cthat\u2019s it\u201d, now little girls are gonna tell themselves \u201cI have the right to mark a goal. I have the right to. I\u2019m gonna go for it.\u201d. We\u2019re maybe gonna see mixed plays in schools. The importance of representation in Skam, is exploding to out faces to each screening and each time a clip drops. They need it.</p><p>J : Did it change you? You personally. Philippine?</p><p>P : Oh la, uh\u2026 No?</p><p>J : No?</p><p>P : No not much no, I don\u2019t think so, but yeah it feels good to be part of a TV show like that, which yeah represents everyone first, and which allows- because it\u2019s true that teenage years are a period where you need to express yourself about a lot of things, you need to try a lot of things, and to see that well, even on tv there are people who try a lot of things that way, I think it feels good.

Axel Auriant, we know each other, you already came.</p><p>Axel : Exactly.</p><p>J : Welcome back. Assa Sylla, welcome, and Philippine Stindel (he butchered her name a bit skdkdkdk), welcome. And, you\u2019re three of Skam\u2019s actors, David Hourregue you\u2019re the director of Skam, of the show airing on the platform France TV Slash, it\u2019s France TV\u2019s platform.</p><p>D : Exactly.</p><p>J : Is that it? Explain Skam to people who know nothing about it.</p><p>D : Skam tells the daily life of high schoolers. Of high schoolers in seconde (first year of high school) and premi\u00e8re (second year of high school) during seasons 3 and 4, and has the particularity of airing in real time.</p><p>J : How is it airing?</p><p>D : So, there\u2019s clearly the episode, if you want to binge watch it there\u2019s the episode at the end of the week</p><p>J : If you want to\u2026 ? (poor old dude is so lost)</p><p>D : Binge watch it. Hi sir.</p><p>J : No but for people who don\u2019t know, I know.</p><p>D : You know.</p><p>J : Some people don\u2019t</p><p>D : There\u2019s the full episode airing at the end of the week like a classical TV show, on fridays at 6pm on Slash, but you can also decide to live another experience, that is to say to live each clip, each part, airing at the hour where it\u2019s supposed to happen in the week. An example-</p><p>J : Yes, for example, if\u2026. A lunch on thursday is going to be at 1pm on thursday.</p><p>D : At 1pm, if they plan to meet on friday for a, for a party or a date, we can be sure that at 7 or 8 pm, all of the audience is online, hoping the meeting will happen and when is it going to drop, what is gonna go down, and how we\u2019re gonna- (they know we\u2019re clowns they really do)</p><p>Other journalist : Are they short clips? How long are the clips?</p><p>D : It\u2019s variable. Actually a clip can last 50 seconds or 8 minutes for example.</p><p>OJ : So you have to follow</p><p>D : You have to follow, knowing that it\u2019s never announced. You don\u2019t have any notification to tell you \u201cit is now\u201d, you never know when it\u2019s gonna drop beforehand, and\u2026</p><p>Third Journalist : And how is it going, how do you know?</p><p>J : On social media</p><p>D : Exactly</p><p>J : Makes us look young, to ask for this [laughs] . They all have their instagram accounts. They all have an account, the characters\u2019 account, and so there are two issues. One, addiction (i won\u2019t be attacked like that sir), we say that some young people are completely drugged on skam, and two, teachers can\u2019t anymore, especially when an episode is supposed to happen at uh\u2026 two to eight.</p><p>D : We got messages from teachers. Asking us, \u201cplease, next week there\u2019s an exam at x hour, try not to drop a clip at 7h56\u201d. So that\u2019s quite\u2026</p><p>J : So you have your characters account, in fact. (he really is lost someone who has actually seen the show help him)</p><p>Assa : Exactly</p><p>J : But, are you the ones behing them? Or are there\u2026</p><p>Axel : Not at all. No, no, there are community managers who are doing that way better than us, in my opinion. And especially, you have to be connected at the same time as the plot happens, at the same time as the episodes are airing, so sometimes you have to post at 11pm, etc, so we\u2019re not always on social media.</p><p>[they all laugh and i think they\u2019re teasing him cause 11pm is early for him?]</p><p>J : Are you gonna disspoint people or do the fans know? (dude we\u2019re not stupid) [Axel looking confused]</p><p>P : Ah no they know I think.</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>P : Well yeah</p><p>J : Who has the most followers?</p><p>Assa : Axel I think</p><p>P : Yeah Axel yeah</p><p>Axel : I think it is- No it\u2019s Lucas, I think.</p><p>J : Yeah you have to diff\u00e9renciate. What does Skam mean?</p><p>D : Shame, in norwegian.</p><p>J : Why norwegian? </p><p>D : Uh\u2026 Cause it\u2019s the remake of a norwegian TV show, who was a true triumph there. It started slowly, nicely, before completely exploding at the end of season 2. And, basically, there, I think 2/3 of norwegian people have seen the show, that\u2019s absolutely huge.</p><p>J : So what are the themes? I can remember sexuality, want to be cool, desire to be integrated, what else?</p><p>Assa : Religion, for season 4.</p><p>Axel : Bullying- actually what\u2019s very strong and allows a lot of young people to relate is that Skam uses the codes of today\u2019s youth in that society, and for every problem we can\u2026 Well, being a teenager is a very carnal/pivotal (the two words are similar in french and he mixed up both) moment, where\u2026</p><p>J : Carnal</p><p>Axel : Yeah, carnal too, exactly, as we can see in the paint, but uh\u2026 That\u2019s the strenght of Skam, it\u2019s that in one plot you can find, for example in Lucas\u2019 storyline - I\u2019m talking about my character - we can find the discovery of his sexuality, at least at that very moment of his life, bullying, every societal norm he suddenly faces, and that\u2019s the strength of Skam, it\u2019s to see a bunch of teens  revealing themselves and supporting each others during that carnal and pivotal period.</p><p>J : We have been talking about it for two minutes, but now we\u2019re gonna see an extract, with you [he points at Axel]</p><p>[it\u2019s the clip where Lucas leaves the church looking for Eliott with all the flashbacks]</p><p>J : So that\u2019s you Axel. Assa, your character, if you had to describe it in a few words?</p><p>Assa : So, Imane\u2019s character is a young woman - well young girl, black, Muslim, hijabi. She tries to live her youth while keeping her faith, her principles, her values. And she also embodies all possible forms of discrimination. Be it religious, physical discriminations\u2026 </p><p>P : About women</p><p>A : About women\u2026 And yeah.</p><p>J : We\u2019re watching an extract with you.</p><p>[last clip of s4 when she explains to Sofiane their relationship would be very difficult because religion is so important in her life, and her family, her muslim friends\u2026]</p><p>J : Philippine that\u2019s your turn, your character?</p><p>P : We\u2019re gonna say\u2026 Uh, a bit wild. She enjoys a good time (literally \u201cune bonne vivante\u201d = \u201ca good liver\u201d)</p><p>J : Wild, enjoying a good time.</p><p>P : That\u2019s it.</p><p>J : That\u2019s it? Can we watch an extract?</p><p>P : Yeah</p><p>[it\u2019s the \u201cyou look like a slut\u201d part at the party with Ingrid]</p><p>J : Am I wrong or, when you talk about it or even when you look at the images we feel that you feel a certain pride about embodying these characters?</p><p>Assa : So much. Really, I\u2019m so\u2026 I\u2019m very very proud, really, extremely proud to be a part of this project, to\u2026</p><p>J : And are you part of the writing of the script? For example?</p><p>[David nods]</p><p>A : For season 4?</p><p>J : He [David] is saying yes. He\u2019s nodding</p><p>[laughs]</p><p>Assa : Well for season 4-</p><p>J : Who got involved in the script writing?</p><p>D : From the start, we don\u2019t build the script opposed to our actors\u2019 energy.</p><p>J : Okay</p><p>D : Skam is of an appalling rhythm during the shooting, and I have to play a little with what they are. And the faster I\u2019m getting closer to what they are and feel, the faster we\u2019re impactful and close to the truth. I think that\u2019s what the audience feels.</p><p>J : And did you take part in the script, Axel and Philippine?</p><p>P : Well, more or less yeah, while talking with David and all that, yeah we might have sometimes given him ideas.</p><p>J : Axel?</p><p>Axel : Me too, there\u2019s a piano scene, it\u2019s true that\u2026 I had just bought a piano and i told David-</p><p>J : I wanna play piano</p><p>Axel : Exactly, and he integrated\u2026</p><p>J : And no drums?</p><p>Axel : No. So\u2026 Why no drums David?</p><p>D : Too simple</p><p>J : David, apparently sometimes you felt a bit overwhelmed by the width of the phenomenon.</p><p>D : Of course, cause you never prepare a TV show imagining the phenomenon it\u2019s going to produce. All that we tried to do, and I\u2019m really including my cast in that, it\u2019s to answer it, not playing deaf about all of the messages that we received. It was, that was really impressive. We really felt from one day to another a sort of-</p><p>J : What are the fans telling you?</p><p>D : \u201cWe don\u2019t feel alone anymore\u201d.</p><p>J : Do they tell you that too? [to the actors i guess]</p><p>Axel : That\u2019s what\u2019s shattering/deeply moving, it\u2019s too see- Because when we\u2019re shooting, we\u2019re trying to live the closest we can to these characters, but it\u2019s to a fictional scale, and to see all of a sudden the impact that the story can have on people, it\u2019s true that we\u2019re very lucky. I counted 2800 letters at home, I\u2019m trying to read and answer everything (and that\u2019s the boy that\u2019s recently been bashed so bad he had to leave twitter\u2026\u2026.. go off i guess). But it\u2019s deeply moving to see how much this story can help people to accept themselves, to accept who they are at that point of their lives, and not necessarily - Lucas\u2019 character for example discovers all of a sudden that he likes men, but it\u2019s beautiful to see friends that say \u201cyes actually, I\u2019m realizing that I may have judged my friend a bit fast, maybe I even throw insults at them\u201d, things you say to joke but hay can actually hurt and really do harm when you\u2019re trying to build yourself. So it\u2019s deeply moving for us and we- Well for me at least I\u2019m becoming way less stupid with Skam, because I understood a lot of things and I met young people, I was able to understand what they\u2019re living today, it\u2019s deeply moving. I\u2019m saying that as if I was 25, while I\u2019m-</p><p>J : Assa, what kind of letters, of words, did you receive?</p><p>Assa : I\u2019m getting a lot of messages from young girls thanking me. \u201cThank you to finally represent us on tv\u201d, \u201cthank you cause I finally understand young muslim girls wearing the hijab\u201d, and that\u2019s very beautiful, that\u2019s really beautiful to get messages like this, to see that well, it touches a huge amount of girls and even boys! Which surprised me a lot. Yeah. And, not only black or muslim girls, just simply young girls relating to Imane\u2019s character.</p><p>J : Were there already hijabi fictional characters? Main characters in a TV show?</p><p>D : Well we searched a lot. And sadly we didn\u2019t find any. In France, she\u2019s the first one.</p><p>J : You\u2019re the first one Assa.</p><p>D : We had to work a lot too so she would understand, that despite all of the inevitable symbolic aspect, we were telling Imane\u2019s story. Because very clearly, there\u2019s such a huge expectation, we\u2019re talking about a phenomenon. There are no more TV shows dedicated to young people, currently. We went through 10 or 15 years with a terrible shortage of shows dedicated to young people that really speak to them. And that\u2019s true that very very fast, we had to make Assa understand - she didn\u2019t really need it - the importance of that moment, which was going to be season 4, while telling her \u201cokay, you\u2019re telling the story of only one young woman. We can never make everyone happy, but let\u2019s tell it the closest of what you lived, and we should touch quite many hearts.\u201d</p><p>OJ : And, are there themes you refuse to deal with? Because we see religion, sexuality\u2026 There\u2019s everything but is there a theme where you told yourself \u201cno, we\u2019re not going there\u201d?</p><p>D : We\u2019re expected on this, and I\u2019m including my authors of course, lead by Niels Rahou, the head writer. Actually, there\u2019s real expectations from our audience that precisely, we don\u2019t keep ourselves away from a lot of things. Of course, everyone warned us when we were about to start season 4, saying \u201care you really sure\u201d. I remember a talk in the bus in between Imane and Sofiane, where she talks about her love for Allah, about her religion and how it makes her feel like a better person, and she faces Lais, Sofiane played by Lais Salameh who\u2019s a believer in life, who explains her dogmes and everything, he thinks it breaks people apart, he doesn\u2019t believe in it, and i remember when we were filming that part, my perchman who was looking at this and telling me \u201care we really\u2026 shooting this right now?\u201d. There was a fear, but there\u2019s such a need that we feel through the messages we receive. If you knew the amount of messages, of topics that they hope we\u2019ll touch on through the show.</p><p>TJ : And what themes, precisely? What themes are coming back, are asked for?</p><p>D : Everything\u2026 Season 3 triggered a sort of earthquake, at least that\u2019s a bit how we lived it, of people who absolutely wanted us to talk about them and about their right not to know, at 17. We\u2019re at the time of Parcoursup (a french internet platform where you apply for uni after your last high school year), you\u2019re asked to know exactly what you want to do really fast. To say : \u201cI have the right not to know if I\u2019m straight, gay, bi, pan\u201d, well it\u2019s going everywhere, and it\u2019s true that now I face so many young people at screenings telling me \u201chere, I\u2019m trans, and I would love it if there was a trans character\u201d. And Skam only repeats a damned evidence that we had forgotten, it\u2019s the importance of representation. We\u2019re all very happy to see, me included, that 10 millions of people are watching girls play football, because we tell ourselves \u201cthat\u2019s it\u201d, now little girls are gonna tell themselves \u201cI have the right to mark a goal. I have the right to. I\u2019m gonna go for it.\u201d. We\u2019re maybe gonna see mixed plays in schools. The importance of representation in Skam, is exploding to out faces to each screening and each time a clip drops. They need it.</p><p>J : Did it change you? You personally. Philippine?</p><p>P : Oh la, uh\u2026 No?</p><p>J : No?</p><p>P : No not much no, I don\u2019t think so, but yeah it feels good to be part of a TV show like that, which yeah represents everyone first, and which allows- because it\u2019s true that teenage years are a period where you need to express yourself about a lot of things, you need to try a lot of things, and to see that well, even on tv there are people who try a lot of things that way, I think it feels good. For me at least, everyone I\u2019ve met told me \u201cwith that I made myself a lot of friends\u201d actually, cause that creates a lot of networks, and the fact it\u2019s on social media probably helps yeah.</p><p>J : So if you want to understand teens, or at least a small part of teenagers, watch Skam, and it\u2019s on the platform France TV Slash.</p><p><b>Game about their playlist :</b></p><p>J : So, what do I have\u2026 The most beautiful song of all history. Starting with you Assa. It\u2019s that.</p><p>[Nelly ft.

(dude we&rsquo;re not stupid) [Axel looking confused]</p><p>P : Ah no they know I think.</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>P : Well yeah</p><p>J : Who has the most followers?</p><p>Assa : Axel I think</p><p>P : Yeah Axel yeah</p><p>Axel : I think it is- No it&rsquo;s Lucas, I think.</p><p>J : Yeah you have to diff&eacute;renciate. What does Skam mean?</p><p>D : Shame, in norwegian.</p><p>J : Why norwegian? </p><p>D : Uh&hellip; Cause it&rsquo;s the remake of a norwegian TV show, who was a true triumph there. It started slowly, nicely, before completely exploding at the end of season 2. And, basically, there, I think 2/3 of norwegian people have seen the show, that&rsquo;s absolutely huge.</p><p>J : So what are the themes? I can remember sexuality, want to be cool, desire to be integrated, what else?</p><p>Assa : Religion, for season 4.</p><p>Axel : Bullying- actually what&rsquo;s very strong and allows a lot of young people to relate is that Skam uses the codes of today&rsquo;s youth in that society, and for every problem we can&hellip; Well, being a teenager is a very carnal/pivotal (the two words are similar in french and he mixed up both) moment, where&hellip;</p><p>J : Carnal</p><p>Axel : Yeah, carnal too, exactly, as we can see in the paint, but uh&hellip; That&rsquo;s the strenght of Skam, it&rsquo;s that in one plot you can find, for example in Lucas&rsquo; storyline - I&rsquo;m talking about my character - we can find the discovery of his sexuality, at least at that very moment of his life, bullying, every societal norm he suddenly faces, and that&rsquo;s the strength of Skam, it&rsquo;s to see a bunch of teens  revealing themselves and supporting each others during that carnal and pivotal period.</p><p>J : We have been talking about it for two minutes, but now we&rsquo;re gonna see an extract, with you [he points at Axel]</p><p>[it&rsquo;s the clip where Lucas leaves the church looking for Eliott with all the flashbacks]</p><p>J : So that&rsquo;s you Axel. Assa, your character, if you had to describe it in a few words?</p><p>Assa : So, Imane&rsquo;s character is a young woman - well young girl, black, Muslim, hijabi. She tries to live her youth while keeping her faith, her principles, her values. And she also embodies all possible forms of discrimination. Be it religious, physical discriminations&hellip; </p><p>P : About women</p><p>A : About women&hellip; And yeah.</p><p>J : We&rsquo;re watching an extract with you.</p><p>[last clip of s4 when she explains to Sofiane their relationship would be very difficult because religion is so important in her life, and her family, her muslim friends&hellip;]</p><p>J : Philippine that&rsquo;s your turn, your character?</p><p>P : We&rsquo;re gonna say&hellip; Uh, a bit wild. She enjoys a good time (literally &ldquo;une bonne vivante&rdquo; = &ldquo;a good liver&rdquo;)</p><p>J : Wild, enjoying a good time.</p><p>P : That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>J : That&rsquo;s it? Can we watch an extract?</p><p>P : Yeah</p><p>[it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;you look like a slut&rdquo; part at the party with Ingrid]</p><p>J : Am I wrong or, when you talk about it or even when you look at the images we feel that you feel a certain pride about embodying these characters?</p><p>Assa : So much. Really, I&rsquo;m so&hellip; I&rsquo;m very very proud, really, extremely proud to be a part of this project, to&hellip;</p><p>J : And are you part of the writing of the script? For example?</p><p>[David nods]</p><p>A : For season 4?</p><p>J : He [David] is saying yes. He&rsquo;s nodding</p><p>[laughs]</p><p>Assa : Well for season 4-</p><p>J : Who got involved in the script writing?</p><p>D : From the start, we don&rsquo;t build the script opposed to our actors&rsquo; energy.</p><p>J : Okay</p><p>D : Skam is of an appalling rhythm during the shooting, and I have to play a little with what they are. And the faster I&rsquo;m getting closer to what they are and feel, the faster we&rsquo;re impactful and close to the truth. I think that&rsquo;s what the audience feels.</p><p>J : And did you take part in the script, Axel and Philippine?</p><p>P : Well, more or less yeah, while talking with David and all that, yeah we might have sometimes given him ideas.</p><p>J : Axel?</p><p>Axel : Me too, there&rsquo;s a piano scene, it&rsquo;s true that&hellip; I had just bought a piano and i told David-</p><p>J : I wanna play piano</p><p>Axel : Exactly, and he integrated&hellip;</p><p>J : And no drums?</p><p>Axel : No. So&hellip; Why no drums David?</p><p>D : Too simple</p><p>J : David, apparently sometimes you felt a bit overwhelmed by the width of the phenomenon.</p><p>D : Of course, cause you never prepare a TV show imagining the phenomenon it&rsquo;s going to produce. All that we tried to do, and I&rsquo;m really including my cast in that, it&rsquo;s to answer it, not playing deaf about all of the messages that we received. It was, that was really impressive. We really felt from one day to another a sort of-</p><p>J : What are the fans telling you?</p><p>D : &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t feel alone anymore&rdquo;.</p><p>J : Do they tell you that too? [to the actors i guess]</p><p>Axel : That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s shattering/deeply moving, it&rsquo;s too see- Because when we&rsquo;re shooting, we&rsquo;re trying to live the closest we can to these characters, but it&rsquo;s to a fictional scale, and to see all of a sudden the impact that the story can have on people, it&rsquo;s true that we&rsquo;re very lucky. I counted 2800 letters at home, I&rsquo;m trying to read and answer everything (and that&rsquo;s the boy that&rsquo;s recently been bashed so bad he had to leave twitter&hellip;&hellip;.. go off i guess). But it&rsquo;s deeply moving to see how much this story can help people to accept themselves, to accept who they are at that point of their lives, and not necessarily - Lucas&rsquo; character for example discovers all of a sudden that he likes men, but it&rsquo;s beautiful to see friends that say &ldquo;yes actually, I&rsquo;m realizing that I may have judged my friend a bit fast, maybe I even throw insults at them&rdquo;, things you say to joke but hay can actually hurt and really do harm when you&rsquo;re trying to build yourself. So it&rsquo;s deeply moving for us and we- Well for me at least I&rsquo;m becoming way less stupid with Skam, because I understood a lot of things and I met young people, I was able to understand what they&rsquo;re living today, it&rsquo;s deeply moving. I&rsquo;m saying that as if I was 25, while I&rsquo;m-</p><p>J : Assa, what kind of letters, of words, did you receive?</p><p>Assa : I&rsquo;m getting a lot of messages from young girls thanking me. &ldquo;Thank you to finally represent us on tv&rdquo;, &ldquo;thank you cause I finally understand young muslim girls wearing the hijab&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s very beautiful, that&rsquo;s really beautiful to get messages like this, to see that well, it touches a huge amount of girls and even boys! Which surprised me a lot. Yeah. And, not only black or muslim girls, just simply young girls relating to Imane&rsquo;s character.</p><p>J : Were there already hijabi fictional characters? Main characters in a TV show?</p><p>D : Well we searched a lot. And sadly we didn&rsquo;t find any. In France, she&rsquo;s the first one.</p><p>J : You&rsquo;re the first one Assa.</p><p>D : We had to work a lot too so she would understand, that despite all of the inevitable symbolic aspect, we were telling Imane&rsquo;s story. Because very clearly, there&rsquo;s such a huge expectation, we&rsquo;re talking about a phenomenon. There are no more TV shows dedicated to young people, currently. We went through 10 or 15 years with a terrible shortage of shows dedicated to young people that really speak to them. And that&rsquo;s true that very very fast, we had to make Assa understand - she didn&rsquo;t really need it - the importance of that moment, which was going to be season 4, while telling her &ldquo;okay, you&rsquo;re telling the story of only one young woman. We can never make everyone happy, but let&rsquo;s tell it the closest of what you lived, and we should touch quite many hearts.&rdquo;</p><p>OJ : And, are there themes you refuse to deal with? Because we see religion, sexuality&hellip; There&rsquo;s everything but is there a theme where you told yourself &ldquo;no, we&rsquo;re not going there&rdquo;?</p><p>D : We&rsquo;re expected on this, and I&rsquo;m including my authors of course, lead by Niels Rahou, the head writer. Actually, there&rsquo;s real expectations from our audience that precisely, we don&rsquo;t keep ourselves away from a lot of things. Of course, everyone warned us when we were about to start season 4, saying &ldquo;are you really sure&rdquo;. I remember a talk in the bus in between Imane and Sofiane, where she talks about her love for Allah, about her religion and how it makes her feel like a better person, and she faces Lais, Sofiane played by Lais Salameh who&rsquo;s a believer in life, who explains her dogmes and everything, he thinks it breaks people apart, he doesn&rsquo;t believe in it, and i remember when we were filming that part, my perchman who was looking at this and telling me &ldquo;are we really&hellip; shooting this right now?&rdquo;. There was a fear, but there&rsquo;s such a need that we feel through the messages we receive. If you knew the amount of messages, of topics that they hope we&rsquo;ll touch on through the show.</p><p>TJ : And what themes, precisely? What themes are coming back, are asked for?</p><p>D : Everything&hellip; Season 3 triggered a sort of earthquake, at least that&rsquo;s a bit how we lived it, of people who absolutely wanted us to talk about them and about their right not to know, at 17. We&rsquo;re at the time of Parcoursup (a french internet platform where you apply for uni after your last high school year), you&rsquo;re asked to know exactly what you want to do really fast. To say : &ldquo;I have the right not to know if I&rsquo;m straight, gay, bi, pan&rdquo;, well it&rsquo;s going everywhere, and it&rsquo;s true that now I face so many young people at screenings telling me &ldquo;here, I&rsquo;m trans, and I would love it if there was a trans character&rdquo;. And Skam only repeats a damned evidence that we had forgotten, it&rsquo;s the importance of representation. We&rsquo;re all very happy to see, me included, that 10 millions of people are watching girls play football, because we tell ourselves &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it&rdquo;, now little girls are gonna tell themselves &ldquo;I have the right to mark a goal. I have the right to. I&rsquo;m gonna go for it.&rdquo;. We&rsquo;re maybe gonna see mixed plays in schools. The importance of representation in Skam, is exploding to out faces to each screening and each time a clip drops. They need it.</p><p>J : Did it change you? You personally. Philippine?</p><p>P : Oh la, uh&hellip; No?</p><p>J : No?</p><p>P : No not much no, I don&rsquo;t think so, but yeah it feels good to be part of a TV show like that, which yeah represents everyone first, and which allows- because it&rsquo;s true that teenage years are a period where you need to express yourself about a lot of things, you need to try a lot of things, and to see that well, even on tv there are people who try a lot of things that way, I think it feels good. For me at least, everyone I&rsquo;ve met told me &ldquo;with that I made myself a lot of friends&rdquo; actually, cause that creates a lot of networks, and the fact it&rsquo;s on social media probably helps yeah.</p><p>J : So if you want to understand teens, or at least a small part of teenagers, watch Skam, and it&rsquo;s on the platform France TV Slash.</p><p><b>Game about their playlist :</b></p><p>J : So, what do I have&hellip; The most beautiful song of all history.
