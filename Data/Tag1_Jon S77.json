He hadn\u2019t been transported to years and years and years ago.

All those courses. All those hours of going over names and dates and facts. It had all been for nothing.</p><p>Because it would not be Robb who would travel with Sansa to ancient times to complete this mission.</p><p>It would be Jon.</p><!-- more --><p>Jon, who\u2019s twenty-first birthday wasn\u2019t supposed to be until December. Jon, who had never shown any interest in the classical arts and knew nothing about the manners in the golden age.</p><p>\u201cTonight we\u2019re gonna be presented to the order. I won\u2019t let you ruin everything I\u2019ve worked for my entire life.\u201d Sansa stood up from her seat again and despite the pain she reached for his hands once more. \u201cBack from the start.\u201d</p><p>But no matter how long they practised, how often they started anew, how loud Sansa yelled at him, his skills were still hopeless when they entered the wonderful looking ballroom in the eighteenth century. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re a guy. But if anyone asks why you\u2019re not dancing, just tell them you have a sprained ankle or something.\u201d Sansa hissed between her teeth while she nodded at the strangers staring at them. She was wearing a golden dress that reached the floor and barely fitted through the door. She had tried to ask if she could at least wear sneakers, since no one would see her shoes anyway, but her mother had found it too much of a risk. </p><p>As if bringing Jon here, completely unprepared and without the proper knowledge, was any less of a risk. And yet, he did look good in his golden costume matching her dress. He had his back straight and his chin up and despite his sweating hands he didn\u2019t look like he was hopelessly out of place. It was quite admirable, considering the fact that up until a few weeks ago he had wanted nothing to do with the whole secret society thing she and Robb were involved in.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Sansa turned her face towards him and she swallowed when their eyes met. \u201cI know that this isn\u2019t easy for you. You\u2019re doing much better than I would have done if I were you.\u201d</p><p>Jon curled his lips up into a slight smile. \u201cI know how important this all is to you.\u201d He leaned a little towards her. \u201cI know that my best isn\u2019t good enough, but I\u2019ll really try to do this right.\u201d He squeezed her hand and instinctively Sansa smiled back. </p><p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d A young man with a bright grin on his face made his way through the crowd straight for them. \u201cMy honorary guests have finally arrived.\u201d He reached for Sansa\u2019s hand and pressed a soft kiss on her knuckles before he pulled her closer towards him. \u201cTales of your beauty have not been doing you any justice, lady Sansa Stark.\u201d He locked her hand in his tight grip and Sansa swallowed when she saw the hunger in his eyes when his glance rested on her exposed cleavage. </p><p>For years she had imagined what the famous Joffrey Baratheon, original founder of the order, looked like. In her dreams he had been a charming and handsome prince and secretly she had imagined how he would fall in love with her and how they would share an intense romance despite being centuries apart. But now she was standing in front of him all those dreams vanished.</p><p>\u201cI am looking forward to spending more time with you, but for tonight I hope you will simply enjoy this ball in your honour.\u201d He ignored Jon completely, as if Jon didn\u2019t even exist and Sansa pulled her hand back as soon as Joffrey gave her the chance to do so. \u201cIt is tradition for the guest of honour to dance the first dance of the night.\u201d He stretched out his hand, but before he could officially ask Sansa to dance with him, Jon cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa?\u201d He held out his hand too. \u201cWould you honour me with your first dance of the evening?\u201d </p><p>It went against all protocol, but a smile spread across Sansa\u2019s face anyway and she firmly placed her hand in his. \u201cIt would be my honour, Jon Snow.\u201d She bent her head slightly and she allowed Jon to guide her to the middle of the dance floor.</p><p>A little reluctantly Jon\u2019s arm circled around her waist and he furrowed his eyebrows when the music started.</p><p>\u201cJust let me lead.\u201d Sansa whispered and she placed a hand on his shoulder. She could feel Joffrey\u2019s eyes lingering on them and she pressed her body a little tighter to Jon\u2019s. \u201cThanks, by the way.\u201d She used her hips and chest to guide him and surprisingly enough Jon followed.</p><p>Jon tightened his grip on her. \u201cNo problem. I don&rsquo;t like how he looks at you.\u201d Jon\u2019s lips were close to her ear and Sansa smiled. \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI kinda like dancing with you.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Sansa\u2019s face brightened. \u201cIf you\u2019re not standing on my toes constantly, I kinda like dancing with you too.\u201d She let her head rest against his shoulder and she was quite surprised how great it felt to do so. </p><p>\u201cAre you still mad that it\u2019s me and not Robb who\u2019s stuck with that gene?\u201d Jon whispered and Sansa shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cOn the contrary, actually.\u201d</p>",
