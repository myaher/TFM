Shaggydog&rsquo;s were more savage.</i></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nfreedom they&rsquo;re calling for,&rdquo; declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and\nhad no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did. &ldquo;<b>They don&rsquo;t like being walled up, and who&rsquo;s\nto blame them? Wild things belong in the wild, not in a castle</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They\nwant to hunt,&rdquo; agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great\nkettle of stew. &ldquo;A wolf smells better'n any man.

See how\nbright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>When\nBran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. &ldquo;Your wolves have more wit\nthan your maester,&rdquo; the wildling woman said. &ldquo;They know truths the\ngrey man has forgotten.&rdquo; The way she said it made him shiver, and <b>when he asked what the comet meant, she\nanswered, &ldquo;Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran\nasked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some\nscrolls snatched from the library fire. &ldquo;It is the sword that slays the\nseason,&rdquo; he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown\nbringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.</i></p><p><i>Though\nOld Nan did not think so, and she&rsquo;d lived longer than any of them. &ldquo;<b>Dragons</b>,&rdquo; she said, lifting her\nhead and <b>sniffing.</b> She was near\nblind and <b>could not see the comet, yet\nshe claimed she could smell it</b>. &ldquo;It be dragons, boy,&rdquo; she\ninsisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.</i></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><i>And\nstill the direwolves howled. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in\nthe kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders\nshivered by their fire, and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights.\nOnly Bran did not mind.</i></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><i>It\nwas dark amongst the trees, but <b>the\ncomet lit his way, and his feet were sure</b>. He was moving on four good legs,\nstrong and swift, and he could feel the ground underfoot, the soft crackling of\nfallen leaves, thick roots and hard stones, the deep layers of humus. <b>It was a good feeling</b>.</i></p><p>Summer\u2019s howls are described as <i>long and sad, full of grief and longing</i>.\nWe see different animals (and humans) react differently to the comet: the\nhounds with fury, the horses with agitation, the Walders with fear. But the direwolves?\nWith sadness, grief and longing \u2013 it doesn\u2019t exactly point to a visceral\nanimosity towards dragons. We\u2019re told that they\u2019re restless, that they want to\nleave the castle, and Bran\u2019s wolf dream inside Summer gives us even more\nperspective, since it looks like Summer\u2019s following the comet, all the while\nbeing simply <i>content </i>at doing so. Surely,\nhe knows what he\u2019s following. If Old Nan can \u201csniff\u201d dragons, direwolves can\ntoo. </p><p><b>2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>But\nwhat about <i>that </i>time when Summer growled\nat the winged serpent atop Winterfell?</b></p><p><i>Men,\nmany men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire. No smell was more dangerous, not\neven the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin. The\nsmoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky <b>he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared\nhis teeth,</b> but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were\neating up the stars. </i></p><p>First, we should be reminded that\nSummer and Shaggydog bare their teeth a <i>lot</i>:\ntoward each other when they fight for food, toward Jojen Reed for questioning Bran\ntoo insistently, toward little Walders for pushing Rickon in the water (even\nthough they were just playing), etc. In ACOK, we mostly see them being\naggressive when Bran and Rickon are either 1) angered, or 2) in perceived\ndanger/threatened by something/someone, so Summer\u2019s reaction at witnessing a \u201cbeast\u201d\nburning down Bran\u2019s home isn\u2019t surprising. Of course, one could wonder why the\nwinged snake had to be put there in the first place if it meant nothing. To\nwhich I\u2019d argue that it <i>does </i>indeed\nmean something\u2026 else. So, we know that Bran&amp;Co were hiding in the crypts the\nnight Winterfell burned. Then, the following morning: </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor\nHODOR!&rdquo; From above came a dull rumble. Then suddenly the door jerked\nupward and a shaft of daylight fell across Bran&rsquo;s face, blinding him for a\nmoment. Another shove brought the sound of shifting stone, and then the way was\nopen.</i></b><i> Osha poked her spear through and\nslid out after it, and Rickon squirmed through Meera&rsquo;s legs to follow. Hodor\nshoved the door open all the way and stepped to the surface. The Reeds had to\ncarry Bran up the last few steps.</i></p><p><i>The\nsky was a pale grey, and <b>smoke eddied\nall around them</b>. They stood in the shadow of the First Keep, or what\nremained of it. One whole side of the building had torn loose and fallen away. <b>Stone and shattered gargoyles lay strewn\nacross the yard. They fell just where I did, Bran thought when he saw them.\nSome of the gargoyles had broken into so many pieces it made him wonder how he\nwas alive at all. Nearby some crows were pecking at a body crushed beneath the\ntumbled stone, but he lay facedown and Bran could not say who he was.</b></i></p><p><i>The\nFirst Keep had not been used for many hundreds of years, but now it was more of\na shell than ever. The floors had burned inside it, and all the beams. Where\nthe wall had fallen away, they could see right into the rooms, even into the\nprivy. Yet behind, the broken tower still stood, no more burned than before.\nJojen Reed was coughing from the smoke. &ldquo;Take me home!&rdquo; Rickon demanded.\n&ldquo;I want to be home!&rdquo; Hodor stomped in a circle. &ldquo;Hodor,&rdquo; he\nwhimpered in a small voice. <b>They stood\nhuddled together with ruin and death all around them.</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;We made noise enough to wake\na dragon,&rdquo; Osha said,</i></b><i> &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no one come. The\ncastle&rsquo;s dead and burned, just as Bran dreamed, but we had best - &rdquo; She\nbroke off suddenly at a noise behind them, and whirled with her spear at the\nready.</i></p><p>It\u2019s interesting that Osha joke\nabout \u201cmaking enough noise to wake a dragon\u201d when they\u2019re surrounded by dead (who\ncouldn\u2019t be woken up no matter what), tumbled stones and broken gargoyles (is\nthis a hint to the prophetic <b>awakening\nof dragons from stones</b>?) It\u2019s even more interesting that the party just\nemerged from the Winterfell\u2019s crypts, and clearly not from a regular exit\neither (Hodor\u2019s efforts at pushing open the door have some Lazarus undertones),\nso if we take the scene as a metaphor, Osha, Bran, Rickon, Hodor, Meera and\nJojen are the ones being awoken from the dead \u2013 even carrying the dead\u2019s\nweapons:</p><p><i>Osha\ncarried her long oaken spear in one hand and the torch in the other. <b>A naked sword hung down her back, one of\nthe last to bear Mikken&rsquo;s mark. He had forged it for Lord Eddard&rsquo;s tomb, to\nkeep his ghost at rest. But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the\narmory, good steel had been hard to resist, even if it meant grave-robbing.\nMeera had claimed Lord Rickard&rsquo;s blade, though she complained that it was too\nheavy. Brandon took his namesake&rsquo;s, the sword made for the uncle he had never\nknown. </b>He knew he would not be much use in a fight, but even so the blade\nfelt good in his hand. </i></p><p>To get back to the \u201cwinged snake\u201d,\nI think it was put there to draw a parallel between the dragons woken from\nstones and Bran&amp;Co themselves being \u201cwoken\u201d from stones (remember the\ntumbling of stones when Hodor finally managed to open that door). Both events were\nlinked with the return of magic: Dany birthing dragons and Bran learning to \u201csee\u201d\nwith his third eye in the crypt: </p><p><i>Here\nin the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened.</i></p><p>I\u2019ll finish with another passage\nbetween <strike>Jon, Daenerys and Ghost</strike> Bran, Meera and Summer:</p><p><i>Laughing,\nthe Reed girl threw her arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both.\nSummer gave a piteous whine, his legs kicking against the cords that bound\nthem. Meera knelt, undid a twist, pulled at a corner, tugged deftly here and\nthere, and suddenly the direwolf was bounding free.</i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>Meera\nshook her head. &ldquo;Does he never grow angry?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Not\nwith me.&rdquo; Bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and Summer snapped at him\nfiercely, but it was all in play. &ldquo;Sometimes he tears my garb but he&rsquo;s\nnever drawn blood.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Your\nblood, you mean. If he&rsquo;d gotten past my net &hellip; &rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you. He\nknows I like you.&rdquo;</i></b></p>",

But the direwolves?\nWith sadness, grief and longing \u2013 it doesn\u2019t exactly point to a visceral\nanimosity towards dragons. We\u2019re told that they\u2019re restless, that they want to\nleave the castle, and Bran\u2019s wolf dream inside Summer gives us even more\nperspective, since it looks like Summer\u2019s following the comet, all the while\nbeing simply <i>content </i>at doing so. Surely,\nhe knows what he\u2019s following. If Old Nan can \u201csniff\u201d dragons, direwolves can\ntoo. </p><p><b>2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>But\nwhat about <i>that </i>time when Summer growled\nat the winged serpent atop Winterfell?</b></p><p><i>Men,\nmany men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire.

The\nsmoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky <b>he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared\nhis teeth,</b> but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were\neating up the stars. </i></p><p>First, we should be reminded that\nSummer and Shaggydog bare their teeth a <i>lot</i>:\ntoward each other when they fight for food, toward Jojen Reed for questioning Bran\ntoo insistently, toward little Walders for pushing Rickon in the water (even\nthough they were just playing), etc. In ACOK, we mostly see them being\naggressive when Bran and Rickon are either 1) angered, or 2) in perceived\ndanger/threatened by something/someone, so Summer\u2019s reaction at witnessing a \u201cbeast\u201d\nburning down Bran\u2019s home isn\u2019t surprising. Of course, one could wonder why the\nwinged snake had to be put there in the first place if it meant nothing. To\nwhich I\u2019d argue that it <i>does </i>indeed\nmean something\u2026 else. So, we know that Bran&amp;Co were hiding in the crypts the\nnight Winterfell burned. Then, the following morning: </p><p><b><i>\u201cHodor hodor hodor hodor hodor\nHODOR!\u201d From above came a dull rumble.

Another shove brought the sound of shifting stone, and then the way was\nopen.</i></b><i> Osha poked her spear through and\nslid out after it, and Rickon squirmed through Meera\u2019s legs to follow. Hodor\nshoved the door open all the way and stepped to the surface. The Reeds had to\ncarry Bran up the last few steps.</i></p><p><i>The\nsky was a pale grey, and <b>smoke eddied\nall around them</b>. They stood in the shadow of the First Keep, or what\nremained of it. One whole side of the building had torn loose and fallen away. <b>Stone and shattered gargoyles lay strewn\nacross the yard. They fell just where I did, Bran thought when he saw them.\nSome of the gargoyles had broken into so many pieces it made him wonder how he\nwas alive at all. Nearby some crows were pecking at a body crushed beneath the\ntumbled stone, but he lay facedown and Bran could not say who he was.</b></i></p><p><i>The\nFirst Keep had not been used for many hundreds of years, but now it was more of\na shell than ever. The floors had burned inside it, and all the beams. Where\nthe wall had fallen away, they could see right into the rooms, even into the\nprivy. Yet behind, the broken tower still stood, no more burned than before.\nJojen Reed was coughing from the smoke. \u201cTake me home!\u201d Rickon demanded.\n\u201cI want to be home!\u201d Hodor stomped in a circle. \u201cHodor,\u201d he\nwhimpered in a small voice. <b>They stood\nhuddled together with ruin and death all around them.</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWe made noise enough to wake\na dragon,\u201d Osha said,</i></b><i> \u201cbut there\u2019s no one come.

It\u2019s even more interesting that the party just\nemerged from the Winterfell\u2019s crypts, and clearly not from a regular exit\neither (Hodor\u2019s efforts at pushing open the door have some Lazarus undertones),\nso if we take the scene as a metaphor, Osha, Bran, Rickon, Hodor, Meera and\nJojen are the ones being awoken from the dead \u2013 even carrying the dead\u2019s\nweapons:</p><p><i>Osha\ncarried her long oaken spear in one hand and the torch in the other. <b>A naked sword hung down her back, one of\nthe last to bear Mikken\u2019s mark.

But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the\narmory, good steel had been hard to resist, even if it meant grave-robbing.\nMeera had claimed Lord Rickard\u2019s blade, though she complained that it was too\nheavy. Brandon took his namesake\u2019s, the sword made for the uncle he had never\nknown. </b>He knew he would not be much use in a fight, but even so the blade\nfelt good in his hand. </i></p><p>To get back to the \u201cwinged snake\u201d,\nI think it was put there to draw a parallel between the dragons woken from\nstones and Bran&amp;Co themselves being \u201cwoken\u201d from stones (remember the\ntumbling of stones when Hodor finally managed to open that door). Both events were\nlinked with the return of magic: Dany birthing dragons and Bran learning to \u201csee\u201d\nwith his third eye in the crypt: </p><p><i>Here\nin the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened.</i></p><p>I\u2019ll finish with another passage\nbetween <strike>Jon, Daenerys and Ghost</strike> Bran, Meera and Summer:</p><p><i>Laughing,\nthe Reed girl threw her arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both.\nSummer gave a piteous whine, his legs kicking against the cords that bound\nthem.
