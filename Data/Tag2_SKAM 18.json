And the humor it shows, the vivid inner life, those little touches made Imane into such an interesting character.

I love how this is really the first time we get to see a whole new side of her - she\u2019s playful, a little competitive, a little flirty in an innocent way. She eats cookies and throws balls at stacks of tin cans and lets herself picture their future children and we can see that she\u2019s just letting herself live the dream at that moment.

All of Imane dancing moments are my favorite but this one in particular - she looks so graceful and fluid and joyful as she dances, it\u2019s like for one brief moment all the weight on her shoulders has been lifted, she\u2019s been given a space to express herself freely and she needs it so badly and it\u2019s so beautiful.

She\u2019s standing up for herself and opening her heart and talking about her deepest wounds and fears all at once, and the way Assa\u2019s voice breaks is just so&hellip;ugh darling.\u00a0</p>",

And well, now he\u2018s standing in the living room, literally covered in different pride flags, ready to punch every homophobe he sees and Eliott just stands there, his little pan-flag pin on his jacket, smiling at his beautiful and stupid idiot boyfriend while he\u2018s falling in love with him all over again. They\u2018re walking hand in hand in a pride parade, celebrating their love loud and clearly while Lucas just smiles brighter than the sun, introducing his mec to everyone who would like to know about Eliott and to everyone else who doesn\u2018t give a fuck too. When they come across some homophobes, Eliott has to hold back his little grumpy hedgehog from doing things he\u2018ll definitely regret later. </p><p>The whole month, Lucas and Eliott show solidarity to every kind of sexuality and every kind of gender. And Lucas tells Eliott even more often how much he loves him and how happy he is that he came into his life. Oh, and they\u2018re still taking it minute by minute, celebrating every second like a big event. </p>",

The eyebrow wiggle in Vendredi 17h12</b>\u00a0\u201cEt moi tu me dessinerais comment.\u201d It\u2019s such a small thing but it made me giggle out of happiness when I first saw it. It\u2019s such an Even thing to do, and Lucas in this clip is so bold and charming - it anchors the reciprocity and playfulness of their relationship, and this clip is the one where I started falling for their version of the story. Right there he\u2019s like\u00a0\u2018okay, bring it on, do your worst\u2019 to Eliott, it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s daring him, and bold Lucas is one of my favorite things ever.\u00a0</p><p><b>2. Lucas\u2019s face just before the kiss in Vendredi 20h27</b>\u00a0\u201cLe premier.\u201d These are quite possibly my favorite few seconds of the entire season. He\u2019s stepped out of the dark and as he raises his hands, he\u2019s letting Eliott know<i> I see you, I know your story, I know who you are</i>. And we believe, in that moment, that he is <i>not afraid</i>, wholeheartedly. There\u2019s almost a hint of cockiness, in that moment, too, a hint of\u00a0\u2018gotcha\u2019, he\u2019s probably happy with himself for having figured it out too. But mostly this is the first time he\u2019s telling Eliott you are not alone, and he feels so certain and sure about it. And he\u2019s so effing thrilled at being part of it all. He\u2019s making a choice, he\u2019s stepping into his own life, his own story. He knows what\u2019s coming and he wants it and he\u2019s letting Eliott know !!!!!!!!!!!!!! god it\u2019s all coming together so perfectly in that moment.\u00a0</p><p><b>3. Gate punching</b> because I like to suffer I guess. Method acting, wow. But in the whole clip, there is something just so intense and overpowering about Lucas\u2019 rage and despair. We are just so there with him, I almost remember how my hand hurt after I watched the clip. I mean I don\u2019t think actors should have to hurt themselves to show their commitment to the role but watching the clip i can totally understand why he did it - he just seems posessed by the role in the whole thing and Lucas\u2019 descent into anger then despair, powerlessness and numbness and so he punches that gate because he has no other way to let the emotions out. Wow.\u00a0</p><p><b>4. Intervention.</b> The whole clip just&hellip;everytime I see it, I cry like a little baby. I am in awe of how Axel just went there so fully without witholding anything. The little waver in his voice as he says how the couch is his room actually, the lip wobble and ugly tears, the sheer raw despair as it all bursts out&hellip;it\u2019s so painful and yet so cathartic as he finally lets it all out, everything that has been building up, and we live every single second with him.\u00a0</p><p><b>5. Lucas\u2019s tearful smile </b>at the end of Jeudi 17:32\u00a0\u201cC\u2019est pas des adieux\u201d. That smile just says so, so much. The weight of all he\u2019s been through, the joy of it, the relief, the pride, the exhaustion, the longing, the sheer happiness. It\u2019s in that moment where it seems he\u2019s realizing the journey he\u2019s just been on and how worth it it has been. He\u2019s finally found someone he loves and that loves him just as much, he\u2019s come out and accepted himself, and even though there was pain and fear and he\u2019s basically having withdrawal symptoms over Eliott leaving, he knows he will get him back. And he\u2019s letting himself bask in those emotions, after so long repressing them. He\u2019s crying in the street and he doesn\u2019t give a shit. It\u2019s so powerful. It\u2019s basically a reward for the hell they\u2019ve put us through all season and just wow. If only for that smile, it was worth it.\u00a0</p><p>I could go on forever, he\u2019s incredible in basically each scene he is in but yeah, those are my personal favorites.\u00a0</p>",
