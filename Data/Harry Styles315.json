They had known each other for ages\u2014 they weren\u2019t best friends or anything, but they did see each other on occasion. Both his family and hers constantly bugged him about when he was going to propose; he just shrugged and laughed it off. \u201cWhen you know, you know.\u201d He said. </p><p>That made Y/N start to question their entire relationship. </p><p><i>When you know, you know? Seriously?

Harry\u2019s neck snapped toward her, his eyes swimming with confusion. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, love?\u201d He asked, grabbing her hand to pull her close, but Y/N stood her ground as she got off the couch to look down at him. </p><p>\u201cI mean, what are we, Harry? We\u2019ve been together over 4 years and it\u2019s like you\u2019ve not even thought about marriage! Every time one of our family members jokes or asks about where our relationship is going, you just shrug or say \u201cwhen it happens, it happens\u201d it\u2019s bullshit! Are you having second thoughts? Do you not want me anymore?\u201d Y/N cried. </p><p>H was horrified by her outburst and quickly stood to comfort her. </p><p>\u201cHey, hey, love. Listen to me,\u201d he said, pulling her in for a hug. \u201cYou are the love of my life. There\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather spend the rest of my life with. To see you walking down the aisle toward me in the most perfect white dress, to see your tummy full of our babies, to travel more of the world with you than I already have, is my dream!\u201d Harry assured her. </p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you asked me to marry you?!\u201d She asked, still crying. Not tears of sadness as they once were, but happiness and love and confusion from his statement. </p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m dumb, love. I just think that I was waiting for too many things to be perfect. You never hinted at any rings when we went to Tiffany or Cartier or Bvgari. I just didn\u2019t think you were ready. I\u2019m all in. Forever.\u201d He smiled, kissing Y/N\u2019s forehead, tears pricking at his eyes as he wiped away hers. </p><p>\u201cSo then marry me, H. I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m done school in a month. I\u2019m meeting you in Australia right after. We\u2019ll travel and see the world. We\u2019ll just be engaged instead of dating. I love you, Harry Styles. I have for over 4 incredibly adventurous and interesting years. I would love nothing more than to provide you with the life and babies you deserve. So, Harry Edward Styles, would you do me the honour of becoming my husband?\u201d Y/N asked, getting down on one knee. She had a ring ready. She had planned to give it to him when he finished his solo tour, as a gift, not as an engagement ring, but it would do. </p><p>\u201cYes, Y/N Y/M/N L/N. I will gladly marry you.\u201d He responded, pulling her off of her knees and kissing her fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m still going to get you a ring though, love. We can both wear them.\u201d He smiled. </p><p>Y/N laughed and jumped up into Harry\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your mom and Gem and I have had one picked out for months.\u201d Y/N giggled. </p><p>\u201cOh, is that so? Then I guess dress shopping won\u2019t be an issue. God, I\u2019m so clueless!\u201d He joked. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I still love you.\u201d She replied, pecking his nose. </p>",

We\u2019ve been together over 4 years and it\u2019s like you\u2019ve not even thought about marriage! Every time one of our family members jokes or asks about where our relationship is going, you just shrug or say \u201cwhen it happens, it happens\u201d it\u2019s bullshit! Are you having second thoughts? Do you not want me anymore?\u201d Y/N cried. </p><p>H was horrified by her outburst and quickly stood to comfort her. </p><p>\u201cHey, hey, love. Listen to me,\u201d he said, pulling her in for a hug. \u201cYou are the love of my life. There\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather spend the rest of my life with. To see you walking down the aisle toward me in the most perfect white dress, to see your tummy full of our babies, to travel more of the world with you than I already have, is my dream!\u201d Harry assured her. </p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you asked me to marry you?!\u201d She asked, still crying. Not tears of sadness as they once were, but happiness and love and confusion from his statement. </p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m dumb, love. I just think that I was waiting for too many things to be perfect. You never hinted at any rings when we went to Tiffany or Cartier or Bvgari. I just didn\u2019t think you were ready. I\u2019m all in. Forever.\u201d He smiled, kissing Y/N\u2019s forehead, tears pricking at his eyes as he wiped away hers. </p><p>\u201cSo then marry me, H. I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m done school in a month. I\u2019m meeting you in Australia right after. We\u2019ll travel and see the world. We\u2019ll just be engaged instead of dating. I love you, Harry Styles. I have for over 4 incredibly adventurous and interesting years. I would love nothing more than to provide you with the life and babies you deserve. So, Harry Edward Styles, would you do me the honour of becoming my husband?\u201d Y/N asked, getting down on one knee. She had a ring ready. She had planned to give it to him when he finished his solo tour, as a gift, not as an engagement ring, but it would do. </p><p>\u201cYes, Y/N Y/M/N L/N. I will gladly marry you.\u201d He responded, pulling her off of her knees and kissing her fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m still going to get you a ring though, love. We can both wear them.\u201d He smiled. </p><p>Y/N laughed and jumped up into Harry\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your mom and Gem and I have had one picked out for months.\u201d Y/N giggled. </p><p>\u201cOh, is that so? Then I guess dress shopping won\u2019t be an issue. God, I\u2019m so clueless!\u201d He joked. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I still love you.\u201d She replied, pecking his nose. </p></p>",

Enjoy it! </p><p><b>Warnings</b>: PURE FLUFF, <i>slight</i> angst </p><p><b>Pairing</b>: Harry Styles x Y/N</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Y/N and Harry had been together over 4 years. They had known each other for ages&mdash; they weren&rsquo;t best friends or anything, but they did see each other on occasion. Both his family and hers constantly bugged him about when he was going to propose; he just shrugged and laughed it off. &ldquo;When you know, you know.&rdquo; He said. </p><p>That made Y/N start to question their entire relationship. </p><p><i>When you know, you know? Seriously? What kind of response is that?</i> She thought. </p><p>So one night she sat him down and decided to confront him about it. </p><p>&ldquo;H, what is this?&rdquo; Y/N asked one night as they were watching the telly. Harry&rsquo;s neck snapped toward her, his eyes swimming with confusion. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, love?&rdquo; He asked, grabbing her hand to pull her close, but Y/N stood her ground as she got off the couch to look down at him. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, what are we, Harry? We&rsquo;ve been together over 4 years and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve not even thought about marriage! Every time one of our family members jokes or asks about where our relationship is going, you just shrug or say &ldquo;when it happens, it happens&rdquo; it&rsquo;s bullshit!

So, can you really trust anybody?</small></p><p><small>When we enter into relationships, we have to realize that no matter how close we might be to another person, we cannot control anyone&rsquo;s behavior but our own, but if you can&acute;t trust a friend to keep your secret how do we expect others to do that as well? No one is safe, specially when false information is being leaked. You have no idea who it might of been, maybe a friend, maybe a enemy or maybe someone you hung out with for an hour. It is true what they say, keep your friends close and your enemies closer ,you never know who will stab you in the back.</small></p><blockquote><p><small>Unveiledhollywood is a celebrity group based on secrets with a little bit of a twist. Each member gets to choose an individual in their life that will expose their secret in the gossip blog. The secret being exposed might not even be true. It might not even be an individual your celeb have been knowing for a while or maybe even know at all, the list of possible exposers is endless. That is exactly what the roleplay is about. Look through our links and join as your favorite celebrity to see how long your secret will be kept. <b>We accept right away and are now looking for a co-admin.</b></small></p></blockquote><h2><b><a href=\"http://unveiledhollywoodrpg.tumblr.com/\">HOME </a>&diams; <a href=\"http://unveiledhollywoodrpg.tumblr.com/ask\">MESSAGE</a> &nbsp;&diams; <a href=\"http://unveiledhollywoodrpg.tumblr.com/taken\">CELEBRITIES </a>&diams; <a href=\"http://unveiledhollywoodrpg.tumblr.com/wanted\">WANTED </a>&diams; <a href=\"http://unveiledhollywoodrpg.tumblr.com/nav\">NAVI</a></b></h2></p>",
