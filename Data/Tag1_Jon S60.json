I just wish it was more of a team effort between Arya and Bran. I always thought that the first scene in ep 1 with bran missing every shot and arya hitting the bullseye was foreshadowing something important. Especially since he had a few visions holding a bow and arrow, I always thought that it would come full circle but instead he just sat there.",
        "answer": "<p>Oh yeah same they definitely dropped the ball with Bran lol no doubt about that. I\u2019m really disappointed with his character because honestly I expected him to be the one to stop the Night King in the end and they really just didn\u2019t do anything with his character. My original theory for the Night Kings ending was that Jamie and Bran would tag team the NK. The episode definitely had its issues and plot holes, but I went into this season with very low expectations for everyone especially Arya and to see that episode was amazing. I just have to separate the books and the show because I think the books are going to focus more on fufilling the prophecies and giving Bran a bigger arc. The show obviously needed to wrap up the NK and Brans story quick so they went with this and if I don\u2019t think too hard about I\u2019m happy with the episode overall. </p>",

He hasn\u2019t slept in about thirty hours and he imagines it\u2019s been longer for the King in the North. The air is thick with smoke and rot, and it\u2019s made almost everyone\u2019s eyes red-rimmed.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot the steel or the dragonglass that\u2019s going to be the problem.\u201d He pauses long enough to eye the pyre they\u2019re constructing for the mass funeral later. \u201cIt\u2019s the amount of hands we have to hold them.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s face always looks grim, but there\u2019s a distance to his gaze now that Gendry doesn\u2019t like. Perhaps for the first time, he\u2019s glad to be low-born.

Hesitantly, Gendry follows suit, rubbing the back of his neck and wondering how this is all going to go.</p><p>Arya\u2019s smile is for Jon, he\u2019s not stupid enough to think otherwise, but when her eyes meet his it turns into something more like a smirk. <i>That</i> makes him stupid.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d the Lady of Winterfell greets, her eyes flickering to him. \u201cAnd Ser\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Gendry.\u201d</p><p>Jon claps him on the shoulder, addressing his sisters. \u201cHe\u2019s the smith responsible for all the weapons. We met at the Wall.\u201d </p><p>Arya folds her hands behind her back, staring expectantly, and Gendry just knows she\u2019s going to watch him make a complete ass of himself and be happy about it.</p><p>\u201cWinterfell thanks you,\u201d the Lady says kindly.
