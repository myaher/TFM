The Youtube channel Talking Thrones <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA\">posted a video</a> that talks in a few of the same directions I write about here; and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1UHGTGlDDT-LfHGij5Xggg\">@oadara</a> and I discussed a lot of this between us over DM, so much of this comes out of that as well.</p><p>So there are two main prophecies most people focus on when it comes to ASOIAF/GOT, which are:\u00a0</p><p><b>- The prophecy that Maggy the Frog</b> gave to Cersei when she was a girl.\u00a0</p><p><b>- The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai prophecy</b> that talks of a coming hero who will save the world from the coming darkness.</p><p>First, let\u2019s look at <b>what George R. R. Martin himself says about prophecies</b>, particularly in fantasy fiction:</p><blockquote><p><i>Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it\u2019s tricky,\u201d Martin noted. \u201cYou want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way. You want to be unpredictable about it. Shakespeare is the ultimate example of that\u2014when the forest of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Castle, MacBeth will fall. Everybody laughs\u2014how can the forest come to the castle. [Malcolm] came camouflaged with branches and so on. Also, during the War of the Roses, one of the lords was prophesized that he would die at a certain castle. So he always took pains to avoid that castle. But then in the first The Battle of St Albans, he was wounded and died outside a pub that had that castle on its pub sign. <b>You have to look at prophecies carefully and look at the weasel-wording.</b></i>\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>(George R.

However, in a way, it is actually <i>unimportant</i>. Because with a self-fulfilling prophecy, <b>the YMBQ could have been <i>anyone</i>.</b> Or, at least, any girl who had a realistic chance of becoming Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <b>There was never one designated person it was destined to be</b>. Which means Sansa, Margaery, Daenerys and, adding in the books, you can probably place Arianne Martell in the group as well, each could have been the YMBQ. <b>The important part is/was how <i>Cersei reacted</i> to the threat of each of these women to BE the YMBQ</b>, NOT who the woman actually <i>was</i>. Because again, <i>it could have been any one of them.</i>\u00a0</p><p>For those who know Harry Potter, it is very much in line with Voldemort hearing that the person who can defeat him will be born \u201cas the seventh month dies.\u201d As HP book readers know, there were <i>two</i> boys born at the end of July - Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. It was Voldemort <i>himself</i> who picked Harry as the Chosen One when he went to kill him in Godric\u2019s Hollow on that Halloween night. However, it could have just as easily <i>not</i> been Harry if Voldemort had picked and gone to kill Neville instead. <i>Voldemort</i> chose his rival, not fate or destiny.</p><p><b>I think the YMBQ part of Cersei\u2019s prophecy is the same type of self-fulfilling\u00a0prophecy that we see in Harry Potter, where <i>Voldemort</i> <i>chose</i> his rival, but with a slight twist</b>.\u00a0With Sansa and Margaery both, Cersei <i>recognized</i> them as threats, as the potential YMBQ of the prophecy she got, and worked to neutralize them as such in any way she could think of. <b>However, the YMBQ has very likely become the person who Cersei <i>didn\u2019t</i> think of as a threat and work to stop from being one until it was actually too late: Daenerys.</b> (Though I do think Arianne Martell still might have chance to be this in the books in some way, even possibly jointly along with Daenerys, since we don\u2019t know the direction\u00a0Arianne\u2019s story will go in relation to Cersei in the books). <b>One of the underlying story threads of both the books and the show is how no one in Westeros is paying/paid all that much attention to Dany and the possible threat she poses</b>,<b> particularly to the Lannisters</b> &hellip; and possibly to Cersei herself. <b>Not until it\u2019s looking to be too late to really do anything about it.</b> Not until <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> at least, (as far as the books go), when it is now possibly too late to stop her from being one.\u00a0</p><p>Which makes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=101\">the scene in the show of <i>Joffrey</i> of all people recognizing the threat she is so early on drip with irony</a>. (Start at 1:42)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dtk5hKomP4MA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D101\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tk5hKomP4MA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p><b><i>Cersei</i> <i>chose</i> who the YMBQ was, by <i>not</i> choosing to see the threat one of the candidates presented to her.</b> Like Voldemort did, Cersei has/is choosing the instruments of her own destruction, and making the prophecy come true, especially by living her life actively engaging with her prophecy and trying to prevent it. </p><p>And from the little we know of him via the books and lore, this appears to have also been Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s downfall as well, actively engaging and living his life based on a prophecy. <b>However, in Rhaegar\u2019s case, the prophecy doesn\u2019t look to be self-fulfilling so much as being a <i>non-literal</i> prophecy.</b> Non-literal prophecies are way more tricky to engage in and with, and may actually <i>lead to</i> the event that the prophecy says is destined to be <i>stopped</i>. \u00a0</p><p>We see a version of this type of prophecy (awkwardly done) in the Star Wars prequels. \u201cAnakin Skywalker is destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to The Force.\u201d Which yes,\u00a0Anakin\u00a0<i>did</i> destroy the Sith; but only <i>after</i> he helped the Sith to destroy the Jedi and became a Sith Lord <i>himself</i>. (Which then brought balance to the force after he killed Palpatine and then he - as Vader - died as well because then the only one left was Jedi Luke, I guess? Again, I said it was <i>awkwardly</i> done, not perfectly done). So yes, if you look at that prophecy literally, Anakin Skywalker <i>did </i>destroy the Sith. It was just the nature of <i><b>why</b></i> and <i><b>how</b></i> this prophecy would come to be true and be fulfilled that was what was missing: that Anakin would help to wipe out the Jedi <i>first </i>BEFORE destroying the Sith.\u00a0</p><p>A better example of this, with the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique used that Martin mentions above, is another example from the Shakespeare play <i>Macbeth,</i>\u00a0and the character of Macduff. Macbeth is told by the three witches that\u00a0\u201cno man of woman born\u201d can kill him, so Macbeth goes though the play thinking that he can not be killed by any man. Turns out, however, that\u00a0Macduff was actually born via a medieval version of a c-section:</p><blockquote><p><i>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br/>Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb <br/>Untimely ripped\u00a0\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>So Macduff technically wasn\u2019t \u201cborn\u201d in the traditional sense as known of at that time. And so yes, Macduff is the one who ultimately kills Macbeth.</p><p>And I think <i>that</i> is that type of prophecy - <b>one of non-literal interpretation - is what we are looking at when it comes to the prophecy in ASOIAF/GOT about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai.</b>\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Let me start by pointing out: <i><b>there is no Night King in the books</b></i>. In the lore of the world there is a <i>Night\u2019s</i> King (possessive S), <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King\">who was this guy</a>:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af4ccfc39d1a4389fa35961de3fc3307/tumblr_inline_pmhek7SlTL1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p><b>The 13th Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch</b>. Bran mentions him in <i>A Storm of Swords,</i> and <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> talks about him as well. It is said that he was a Stark, possibly the brother of the then-current King of Winter. <b>In brief, his story was thus:</b> he saw a woman for atop the wall one night\u00a0&quot;with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.&ldquo; He fell in love with her even though\u00a0&quot;her skin was cold as ice&rdquo; and, when he gave her his seed, he gave her his soul as well. <b>With her, he claimed the Nightfort as his castle and declared himself as King and her his Queen. There, he ruled for 13 years until the King of Winter and the King-Beyond-The-Wall brought him down</b>.\u00a0</p><p>As far as we know so far, the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King has no relation or connection to <i>this</i> guy from the show, known as the <i>Night</i> King (no possessive S):</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7e66568595e90042da76e31f0b0f0/tumblr_inline_pmiqnj3dKZ1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure><p>Not least of which because <b>their backstories are compelty different.</b> The Night King of the show was created by the Children of the Forest for their war against the First Men, which clearly happened years - if not decades - before the end of the first Long Night (which, itself, lasted a generation), the construction of The Wall and the formation of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m bringing up the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King and <i>Night</i> King difference - and that the Night King is show-only - because of one particular story point with regards to the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King that I don\u2019t want anyone confusing with the <i>Night</i> King of the show. And that is: when the Night\u2019s King was finally brought down, it was discovered that he had been making sacrifices to The Others, aka the White Walkers. The lore never <i>directly</i> says what type of sacrifices he was making to them.<b> However, given what we\u2019ve seen presented in both the books and the show, there appears to only be one type of sacrifices The Others/White Walkers have ever appeared to take: human babies.</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in both the books and the show, Craster was somehow able to negotiate with The Others/White Walkers to make an agreement to sacrifice his own sons to them. So it doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a stretch to assume that the Night\u2019s King was able to make some similar type of deal to sacrifice any children he made with his Queen to them as well.\u00a0</p><p><b>So what do The Others/White Walkers want?<i>\u00a0We already know what they want. </i>The books, the lore and the show have all already told us, and even </b><i><b>shown</b></i><b> us, what\u00a0they want.</b> Twice now, they have made deals and taken human sacrifices - babies - and left the places south of the wall alone when they have received such things. There is no reason to believe that they would never do so again. <b>We just don\u2019t know <i>why</i> they want what they do, which is a different question than asking <i>what</i> they want.\u00a0</b></p><p>So, knowing this, how might this tie into the prophecy of\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First off, in the books, the wording of the prophecy falls very much into the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique that Martin himself talks about. Because the person who speaks the most about the prophecy, Melisandre, talks about the prophecy being about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised <i>and</i> Azor Ahai <i>interchangeably</i>. Her talking about the prophecy in this way gives the impression that\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai are one-in-the-same, and one is just another name for the other.</p><p><b>However, what if that is not the case.</b> Now, it\u2019s complicated because the show has never either mentioned nor referred to\u00a0Azor Ahai, (except for possibly as just an easter egg in a book Gilly is seen reading in S7), but has used the wording more associated with\u00a0Azor Ahai to talk about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised.\u00a0</p><p>Another problem is that there is no one-description of what the prophecy actually <i>is</i>. In <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Davos III</b>),\u00a0Melisandre says this:</p><blockquote><p><i>When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.</i>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Pretty straight forward. But again,<b> this talks about\u00a0Azor Ahai being reborn and how, <i>not </i>saying anything about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised, or them being the same person.</b>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>And then, of course, there is the gender pronoun confusion</b>, which is mentioned both in the books and the show,<b> both</b> <b>dealing with the mistranslation about The Prince Who Was Promised</b>. Maester Aemon in <i>A Feast For Crows</i>\u00a0(<b>Samwell IV</b>) says:</p><blockquote><p><i>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. <b>Dragons are neither male nor female,</b> Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy originally having been made using the word for <i>dragon</i> in High Valyrian, and dragons, by nature, have no fixed gender. (The lore giving various opinions of if dragons can continually change sex at will or not. The only real way to tell if a dragon is male or female is if it lays eggs or not).\u00a0</p><p>And in the show (<b>Episode 7x02</b>) Missandei says:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>That noun has no gender in High Valyrian.</b> The proper translation for that prophecy would be, \u2018the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.\u2019</i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>So what we have here is not only confusion as to whether or not Azor Ahai reborn is supposed to be the same person as The Prince Who Was Promised, but also <i>gender confusion</i> about <b>The Prince Who Was Promised\u00a0</b>because High Valyrian nouns are not gender specific.</b> On top of which, the show has only talked opening about The Prince Who Was Promised, but made no mention of Azor Ahai and him possibly being reborn <i>as</i> the prince who was promised or not.</p><p>Then of course, also from the books, <b>we have the knowledge that a song was composed for The Prince Who Was Promised</b>, which is called/known as\u00a0\u201cthe song of ice and fire\u201d which Daenerys learns of in her vision in the House of the Undying. (<i>ACOK</i>, <b>Daenerys IV</b>)\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>I\u2019m not the first person to suggest that The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai reborn are two different people</b> and that, between the mistranslations and gender confusion, the two things got mixed up together. But to make it clear, I\u2019d say <b>Azor Ahai is the one who will be reborn via salt and smoke who will wake dragons from stone</b>, and that <b>The Prince Who Was Promised is a separate prophecy, and person, and is the one who \u201cwill bring the dawn.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>So what does this have to do with The Others/White Walkers? Well, this is where more of that that <i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique Martin calls it comes in. In that what if The Prince Who Was Promised was actually promised <i>to</i> something - or someone. Namely, The Others/White Walkers. And what if it was a promise Azor Ahai <i>himself </i>made to them? It would go a ways to explain why the two are always connected to each other</p><p>If you look at the actual history of the First Long Night,\u00a0<b>Azor Ahai never actually\u00a0</b><i><b>defeated</b></i><b> The Others/White Walkers. He and the members of the first Night\u2019s Watch were able to drive them back, and had them flee into the Lands of Always Winter, but they were never defeated completely.</b> Which is why The Wall was built in the first place and The Night\u2019s Watch established - to guard <i>against</i> The Others/White Walkers coming back south and taking over the realms of Men as they did during the First Long Night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be496d497142e862a19df7c6a121b16c/tumblr_inline_pobg04Kybu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\"/></figure><p><b>So what if it was Azor Ahai himself who promised this\u00a0\u201cprince\u201d to The Others/White Walker as a way to keep them from trying to invade the realms of Men another time?</b> Again, via both the 13th LC of the NW and Craster, we know making pacts/deals with The Others/White Walkers is possible in some way. <b>So, who is this\u00a0\u201cprince who was promised\u201d? Yeah, I could just say Jon Snow, (because that\u2019s what it likely looks like I\u2019m about to say), but actually no, what if it\u2019s <i>not</i> him? Or, more specifically, what if it was <i>supposed</i> to be him but, once again, the prophecy got slightly misinterpted?</b></p><p>Put a pin in this. We\u2019ll come back to it. For now, let&rsquo;s go back to the 13th LC and Craster.</p><p>According to Old Nan, the 13th LC was a Stark, meaning he contained the blood of the First Men. <b>The blood of the First Men is thought to carry some magical properties, particularly within the Stark family bloodline, which contain warging and greenseer abilities.</b> And the Stark Kings of old were known as the Kings of Winter. So by the 13th LC likely sacrificing children of his blood that he made with his Night\u2019s Queen, he was providing The Others/White Walkers children that carried a strong magical element in their blood.</p><p><b>Throughout the story and the lore, the Stark are also associated with Ice. Even their Great Valyrian Sword is called simply\u00a0\u201cIce.\u201d\u00a0</b><br/></p><p><b>With Craster</b>, <b>things are less certain there wrt the magical elements. </b>Wildlings, which his mother was said to be, are also of the Blood of the First men, but it is not clear if the magical element is a strong among the Wildings as it is with the Starks. <b>The main point, however, is that The Others/White Walkers accepted Craster\u2019s sons as offerings, just as they did from the Night&rsquo;s King/13th LC. So they were clearly deemed as acceptable in that regard.</b>\u00a0Because, at the very least, they carried the blood of the First Men in them, from Craster\u2019s Wildling mother.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>[<b>Side Note:</b> <b>There is probably going to be a plot-hole in the show wrt Craster\u2019s kids - Gilly\u2019s baby Little Sam specifically. Because, in the books, there is a baby-switching plot going on with Gilly\u2019s baby</b>, (he isn\u2019t named Little Sam in the books, he\u2019s just referred to as\u00a0<i>Monster</i> instead), <b>and Mance Rayder\u2019s baby son.</b> (Yes, Mance has a baby son in the books). Jon more or less forced Gilly to switch her son with Mance\u2019s baby son to try and protect Mance\u2019s son from possibly being killed/burned to death. So that is the fate that might actually befall Gilly\u2019s baby son in the books while Jon is still currently dead, leaving NONE of Craster\u2019s sons alive after that.]\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>So what we have here are two instances of sacrifices to The Others being made and accepted by the Others/White Walkers. And again, the only thing we\u2019ve seen The Others/White Walkers take as a sacrifice are babies.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s go back and look at The Prince Who Was Promised and, more specifically, the thing Rhaegar says about the song composed for him, specifically called\u00a0\u201cThe Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d As we all know, that is the actual title of Martin\u2019s book series that the tv show <i>Game of Thrones</i> is based on. And, of course, <b>Jon being the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark have many thinking he is \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised\u201d and the\u00a0\u201csong of ice and fire\u201d because of his blood combination.</b> <b>However, there is another thing in the lore with the title Ice and Fire in it that is being overlooked here </b>that I think is very significant, particularly wrt The Others/White Walkers.</p><p>And that is,<b>\u00a0<i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i></b>.\u00a0</p><p><i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> was a pact forged between House Stark and House Targaryen, (more specifically the black faction of House Targaryen during the Dance of Dragons). <b>As it is described in <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i>, it was an agreement between the two houses that a Stark male would wed a Targaryen Princess.</b> (The recent book<i> Fire and Blood</i> gives more of an account and specifics of <i>who </i>the Princess would be &hellip; or, at least, who her <i>father</i> was supposed to be). The pact, however, was never fulfilled after The Dance ended.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What is the significant part of this is what House Stark was specifically asking for, which was a Targaryen <i>princess</i>. Cregan Stark specifically wanted a young Targaryen\u00a0<i>girl</i> to wed into the Stark family.\u00a0</p><p>As explained above, via both the books/lore and the show, <b>the Starks have a connection to the happenings with The Others/White Walkers.</b>\u00a0We have the story of the 13 Lord Commander/Night\u2019s King. We know about Bran the Builder who, with the help of the Children of the Forest (and giants) helped raise the wall to guard against them invading again.<b> I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to believe that the Kings of Winter of ages past, as the Stark Kings were first called, not only <i>knew</i> about \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised,\u201d but likely also what the true meaning of what this prince/princess\u00a0<i>being</i> promised was all about.</b> That whomever this prince/princess was, when born, they would be given to the The Others, who had been promised to them by\u00a0Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>So what might this have to do with the <i>Pact of Ice and Fire</i> and requesting a Targaryen princess to marry into House Stark? I think a clue comes from Book 2, <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, and Daenerys\u2019 encounter with The Undying in the House of the Undying.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f51c4054946c4c1a6b8cd02f3f7bd89c/tumblr_inline_pobikwIDyK1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p>In ACOK, the Undying Ones are described in a way that has them seeming to be a representation of The Others/White Walkers; with them being described as\u00a0\u201cblue and cold.\u201d And then there is this passage, where they try to consume Daenerys (<b>Daenerys IV, ACOK</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>They wanted her, needed her<b>, the fire, the life, </b>and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them \u2026</i></p><p><i>But then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the <b>indigo air</b>, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany\u2019s gasp turned to horror. <b>The Undying were all around her,</b> <b>blue and cold</b>, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their <b>dry cold hands</b>, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. <b>Even her heart had ceased to beat.</b> She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting \u2026</i></p><p><i><b><i>Then indigo</i></b><i> turned to <b>orange</b>, and whispers turned to screams. <b>Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone</b>, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. <b>Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and</b> <b>tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons</b>, and when his head snapped forward, <b>fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot</b>. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. \u201c</i><br/></i></p></blockquote><p>Here we have the Undying, who are described in terms of cold and death, linking them in many way to The Others/White Walkers, trying to consume the fire - which is linked to life - of Daenerys. (And they almost succeeded until Drogon saves her).\u00a0</p><p><b>There is indication that The Undying have been waiting for Daenerys for thousands of years before this moment.</b> <b>They want the lifeforce, <i>the fire</i> that she has, when she finally comes. </b>So what we have here are creatures associated with imagery of - and visually linked to - creatures of death, (The Others/White Walkers), trying to to consume a life,<b><i> the fire</i></b>, from someone of Valyrian descent. <b>Valyrian blood constantly linked to that of fire, and fire, throughout\u00a0the series, is linked to life.</b> House Targaryen\u2019s own words (a house motto they chose when Aegon the Conqueror first began his conquest and wanted his family to adopt more Westerosi culture BTW - they never had a House motto before that) is <i>Fire and Blood</i>, two images also associated with life.\u00a0</p><p><b>Just like The Undying, The Others/White Walkers also appear to be seeking life of some kind.</b> The taking of babies, and then using those babies to create more of their kind by turning them into Others/White Walkers I think ties into this.

In our joining there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast shadows.</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the show was being a bit more hard-hitting in the foreshadowing than the book by having Melisandre say these words while appearing to try and <i>seduce</i> Jon. <b>That there is power in the ability - in the <i>act</i> - of men and women coming together and creating life. </b>Unlike The Others/White Walkers, who can only create more of themselves by taking an already living creation - in this case, a child - and turning them into a being like them, a being of the cold.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, even with the power of men and women to do this, The Undying specifically were waiting for and sought out <i>Daenerys</i> for that life, <i>that fire</i>, that they needed. <b>And that may be because, while both male and female coming together can create life and light, it is the <i>female</i> who brings forth that light and life\u00a0<i>into</i> the world via childbirth.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>There is a running theme of motherhood, and what that means, throughout\u00a0Daenerys\u2019 story. She is called Mhysa by the people she liberated from slavery and metaphorically\u00a0giving\u00a0them new life as free\u00a0people. She birthed creatures that are considered to be fire made flesh via</b><i> <b>fire itself</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>I think <i>this</i> is why <i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> called for a Targaryen <i>princess</i> to wed into House Stark. <b>That the need for a joining of Ice and Fire had to specially be that the fruits of that joining, the life created from it, be <i>born</i> of fire; </b>born via a daughter - a female - who carried such fire within her, which those of Valyrian descent do.\u00a0</p><p>And this is where Rhaegar Targaryen made one of his many mistakes when it comes to the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. At some point I do think Rhaegar thought he needed a child who was - bloodline-wise - of\u00a0\u201cice and fire.\u201d <b>Rhaegar had already changed his life twice-over trying to fulfill the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. There is no reason to assume he wouldn\u2019t have done it again if he came into more info about it. </b>For all he did likley love Lyanna, I think it\u2019s probable that he also saw their child as the one who would make this prophecy he\u2019d been chasing most of his life come true &hellip; after first thinking it was about himself, and then thinking it would be about his three children he would (hopefully) have, and the idea that \u201cthe dragon has three heads.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>However, again, Rhaegar was incorrect, not just about what the whole idea of The Prince That Was Promised actually meant, but how the blood combination of Ice and Fire was supposed to be &hellip; or, more specifically, how the child had to be born. <b>Because Lyanna wasn\u2019t fire, or the blood of fire. She was of </b><i><b>ice</b>, </i><b>with the blood of the First Men within her, not the blood of Old Valyria. And the Prince Who Was Promised more than likely\u00a0had to be born of <i>fire</i>, via a female </b><i><b>with the blood of fire</b>.</i></p><p>From <i>A Game of Thrones</i> (<b>Daenerys X</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she wanted to shout to him, no my good knight, do not fear for me. <b>The fire is mine.</b> I am Daenerys Stormborn, <b>daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons</b>, don\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Blood of the Dragon</i> are what those of blood of Old Valyria are called. Dragons are fire made flesh. Those of the blood Old Valyria, the Targaryens, like dragons, are also likely fire made flesh. And <i>fire</i> is life and light.\u00a0</p><p><b>And the coming together of <i>that </i>fire with ice is symbolic of <i>balance.</i></b>\u00a0From <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (<b>Daenerys IV</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I have come for the gift of truth,&rdquo; Dany said. &ldquo;In the long hall, the things I saw &hellip; were they true visions, or lies?

Nobody knows who he was before \u2014 a soldier or part of [nobility]. He never wanted to be the Night King. I think he wants revenge. Everybody in this story has two sides \u2014 a bad side and a good side. The Night King only has one side, a bad side.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Thinking the Night King wants revenge isn\u2019t the same as that being what he definitely wants. <b>However, the idea that the Night King only has a bad side seems to fit with the view of what The Great Other is and represents in the books/lore, which is the god of darkness and death. </b>However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that cut and dry even via what The Great Other/Night King is. Because evil acts can be committed by those who fight for the light, such as good acts can likely be committed by those who fight for darkness/death. Melisandre\u2019s burning of Shireen Baratheon, which Martin has already confirmed will happen in the books as well, is proof enough of that. \u00a0</p><p>Also, from the recent interview, there is this:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What can we expect from him in the final season?</b></i></p><p><i>People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There\u2019s also that moment [in \u201cHardhome\u201d] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms \u2014 there\u2019s a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time.</i> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>I think it\u2019s pretty clear that that target <i>isn\u2019t </i>Jon Snow. He had more than one opportunity to kill Jon, but proceeded instead to mostly just taunt him.</b> I don\u2019t think the target is Daenerys either, or he could have easily killed Drogon and gotten her when she came beyond the wall in Episode 6 of Season 7.</p><p>The Three-eyed Raven/Crow being the target - with that now being Bran, is an option I admit, however &hellip; the original Three-Eyed Raven/Crow, who was Brynden Rivers aka Bloodraven, had been the Three-Eyed Raven/Crow for many years, and there is little to no indication that The Night King was actively trying to kill him during any of that time.</p><p><b>However, what if the killing of the target doesn\u2019t mean just \u201cto kill,\u201d so much in the sense of what we saw happen to the former Three-Eyed Raven in the show,</b> <b>but is more in the vein of what happened to Daenerys in the House of the Undying in the books, when the Undying tried to take her life-force from her.</b></p><p>And the person they want to do this with is actually the <i>child</i> Daenerys and Jon will/have created?</p><p><b>Because the foreshadowing that Jon and Daenerys will have a child in the coming season was pretty obvious, not to mention Daenerys whole underlying story theme and motif of motherhood. </b>Also, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CczKaabSRfU?t=76\">do not overlook this clip, which HBO chose to highlight before the start of Season 8,</a> where Viserys makes this comment about the child that Dany is set to have with Khal Drogo (<b>Episode 1x06</b>) (Start: 1:16):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCczKaabSRfU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D76\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CczKaabSRfU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><blockquote><p><i>He won\u2019t be a real Targaryen.

(In fact, I think Jon\u2019s going to learn a hard lesson about that when the baby switching plot he instigated wrt Gilly\u2019s baby in the books plays out to a tragic end for Gilly\u2019s baby). <b>If they can find a way to defeat The Others/White Walkers without having to make such a sacrifice and basically taking the easy way out to do so, they may also guarantee that this time, The Others/White Walkers will truly be destroyed and gone forever this time.</b> Instead of what Azor Ahai did, which only seemed to have the go into some kind of slumber and dormancy, and staying in the lands beyond the wall.</p><p><b>However, there may be some among Jon and Daenerys\u2019 army and/or advisors who would want to take the easy route and give the child over to end the conflict quickly</b>, which - while pushing off the problem again for another couple of thousands years - could prevent many people from dying and becoming a part of the Army of the Dead and overrunning Westeros as was what happened during the first Long Night. (Which didn\u2019t stay limited to only Westeros, but spread over almost all of Essos as well).</p><p>In the show, Daenerys\u2019 story has a theme about wanting to\u00a0\u201cbreak the wheel\u201d; the wheel being the nature of the political dynamics of Westeros that benefits the more Noble Classes that fight for power and dominance, symbolized by the Iron Throne, and those who do not benefit from that ongoing struggle, which are the lower classes and smallfolk of Westeros. They are the ones who are always crushed underneath this wheel, this circular nature of the political power fights and wars.\u00a0</p><p><b>However, this idea of\u00a0\u201cbreaking the wheel\u201d may also, in the end, extend to the fight against The Others/White Walkers.</b> As noted, this is not the first time they have invaded the realms of men. And, the last time they did, they were not defeated. The problem they are, the threat they pose, seems to have been pushed off to another generation to have to fight, combat and deal with. And at the center of that fight to do so might just rest with Ice and Fire coming together to create something new. <b>However, the prophecy that has dictated the lives of many people that has lead to this, has never dictated the lives of the two people who may have the most influence in The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy coming to fruition. </b>Neither Jon or Daenerys have lived their lives or made decisions in their lives sorley to fulfil a prophecy. <b>And given what was very likely the <i>weasel-wording</i> technique used for The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy, the fact that they did so may, in the end, be the deciding factor in the breaking of <i>another</i> wheel, another cycle of destruction.</b>\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7a30aee294fcf2ca367f6036e2f18/tumblr_inline_podb5g0cdu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\"/></figure>",

However, in a way, it is actually <i>unimportant</i>. Because with a self-fulfilling prophecy, <b>the YMBQ could have been <i>anyone</i>.</b> Or, at least, any girl who had a realistic chance of becoming Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <b>There was never one designated person it was destined to be</b>. Which means Sansa, Margaery, Daenerys and, adding in the books, you can probably place Arianne Martell in the group as well, each could have been the YMBQ. <b>The important part is/was how <i>Cersei reacted</i> to the threat of each of these women to BE the YMBQ</b>, NOT who the woman actually <i>was</i>. Because again, <i>it could have been any one of them.</i>\u00a0</p><p>For those who know Harry Potter, it is very much in line with Voldemort hearing that the person who can defeat him will be born \u201cas the seventh month dies.\u201d As HP book readers know, there were <i>two</i> boys born at the end of July - Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. It was Voldemort <i>himself</i> who picked Harry as the Chosen One when he went to kill him in Godric\u2019s Hollow on that Halloween night. However, it could have just as easily <i>not</i> been Harry if Voldemort had picked and gone to kill Neville instead. <i>Voldemort</i> chose his rival, not fate or destiny.</p><p><b>I think the YMBQ part of Cersei\u2019s prophecy is the same type of self-fulfilling\u00a0prophecy that we see in Harry Potter, where <i>Voldemort</i> <i>chose</i> his rival, but with a slight twist</b>.\u00a0With Sansa and Margaery both, Cersei <i>recognized</i> them as threats, as the potential YMBQ of the prophecy she got, and worked to neutralize them as such in any way she could think of. <b>However, the YMBQ has very likely become the person who Cersei <i>didn\u2019t</i> think of as a threat and work to stop from being one until it was actually too late: Daenerys.</b> (Though I do think Arianne Martell still might have chance to be this in the books in some way, even possibly jointly along with Daenerys, since we don\u2019t know the direction\u00a0Arianne\u2019s story will go in relation to Cersei in the books). <b>One of the underlying story threads of both the books and the show is how no one in Westeros is paying/paid all that much attention to Dany and the possible threat she poses</b>,<b> particularly to the Lannisters</b> \u2026 and possibly to Cersei herself. <b>Not until it\u2019s looking to be too late to really do anything about it.</b> Not until <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> at least, (as far as the books go), when it is now possibly too late to stop her from being one.\u00a0</p><p>Which makes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=101\">the scene in the show of <i>Joffrey</i> of all people recognizing the threat she is so early on drip with irony</a>.

(Which then brought balance to the force after he killed Palpatine and then he - as Vader - died as well because then the only one left was Jedi Luke, I guess? Again, I said it was <i>awkwardly</i> done, not perfectly done). So yes, if you look at that prophecy literally, Anakin Skywalker <i>did </i>destroy the Sith. It was just the nature of <i><b>why</b></i> and <i><b>how</b></i> this prophecy would come to be true and be fulfilled that was what was missing: that Anakin would help to wipe out the Jedi <i>first </i>BEFORE destroying the Sith.\u00a0</p><p>A better example of this, with the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique used that Martin mentions above, is another example from the Shakespeare play <i>Macbeth,</i>\u00a0and the character of Macduff. Macbeth is told by the three witches that\u00a0\u201cno man of woman born\u201d can kill him, so Macbeth goes though the play thinking that he can not be killed by any man. Turns out, however, that\u00a0Macduff was actually born via a medieval version of a c-section:</p><blockquote><p><i>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br>Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb <br>Untimely ripped\u00a0\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>So Macduff technically wasn\u2019t \u201cborn\u201d in the traditional sense as known of at that time. And so yes, Macduff is the one who ultimately kills Macbeth.</p><p>And I think <i>that</i> is that type of prophecy - <b>one of non-literal interpretation - is what we are looking at when it comes to the prophecy in ASOIAF/GOT about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai.</b>\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Let me start by pointing out: <i><b>there is no Night King in the books</b></i>. In the lore of the world there is a <i>Night\u2019s</i> King (possessive S), <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King\">who was this guy</a>:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af4ccfc39d1a4389fa35961de3fc3307/tumblr_inline_pmhek7SlTL1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p><b>The 13th Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch</b>. Bran mentions him in <i>A Storm of Swords,</i> and <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> talks about him as well. It is said that he was a Stark, possibly the brother of the then-current King of Winter. <b>In brief, his story was thus:</b> he saw a woman for atop the wall one night\u00a0\"with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.\u201c He fell in love with her even though\u00a0\"her skin was cold as ice\u201d and, when he gave her his seed, he gave her his soul as well. <b>With her, he claimed the Nightfort as his castle and declared himself as King and her his Queen. There, he ruled for 13 years until the King of Winter and the King-Beyond-The-Wall brought him down</b>.\u00a0</p><p>As far as we know so far, the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King has no relation or connection to <i>this</i> guy from the show, known as the <i>Night</i> King (no possessive S):</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7e66568595e90042da76e31f0b0f0/tumblr_inline_pmiqnj3dKZ1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"></figure><p>Not least of which because <b>their backstories are compelty different.</b> The Night King of the show was created by the Children of the Forest for their war against the First Men, which clearly happened years - if not decades - before the end of the first Long Night (which, itself, lasted a generation), the construction of The Wall and the formation of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m bringing up the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King and <i>Night</i> King difference - and that the Night King is show-only - because of one particular story point with regards to the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King that I don\u2019t want anyone confusing with the <i>Night</i> King of the show. And that is: when the Night\u2019s King was finally brought down, it was discovered that he had been making sacrifices to The Others, aka the White Walkers. The lore never <i>directly</i> says what type of sacrifices he was making to them.<b> However, given what we\u2019ve seen presented in both the books and the show, there appears to only be one type of sacrifices The Others/White Walkers have ever appeared to take: human babies.</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in both the books and the show, Craster was somehow able to negotiate with The Others/White Walkers to make an agreement to sacrifice his own sons to them. So it doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a stretch to assume that the Night\u2019s King was able to make some similar type of deal to sacrifice any children he made with his Queen to them as well.\u00a0</p><p><b>So what do The Others/White Walkers want?<i>\u00a0We already know what they want. </i>The books, the lore and the show have all already told us, and even </b><i><b>shown</b></i><b> us, what\u00a0they want.</b> Twice now, they have made deals and taken human sacrifices - babies - and left the places south of the wall alone when they have received such things. There is no reason to believe that they would never do so again. <b>We just don\u2019t know <i>why</i> they want what they do, which is a different question than asking <i>what</i> they want.\u00a0</b></p><p>So, knowing this, how might this tie into the prophecy of\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First off, in the books, the wording of the prophecy falls very much into the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique that Martin himself talks about. Because the person who speaks the most about the prophecy, Melisandre, talks about the prophecy being about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised <i>and</i> Azor Ahai <i>interchangeably</i>. Her talking about the prophecy in this way gives the impression that\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai are one-in-the-same, and one is just another name for the other.</p><p><b>However, what if that is not the case.</b> Now, it\u2019s complicated because the show has never either mentioned nor referred to\u00a0Azor Ahai, (except for possibly as just an easter egg in a book Gilly is seen reading in S7), but has used the wording more associated with\u00a0Azor Ahai to talk about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised.\u00a0</p><p>Another problem is that there is no one-description of what the prophecy actually <i>is</i>. In <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Davos III</b>),\u00a0Melisandre says this:</p><blockquote><p><i>When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.</i>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Pretty straight forward. But again,<b> this talks about\u00a0Azor Ahai being reborn and how, <i>not </i>saying anything about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised, or them being the same person.</b>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>And then, of course, there is the gender pronoun confusion</b>, which is mentioned both in the books and the show,<b> both</b> <b>dealing with the mistranslation about The Prince Who Was Promised</b>. Maester Aemon in <i>A Feast For Crows</i>\u00a0(<b>Samwell IV</b>) says:</p><blockquote><p><i>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. <b>Dragons are neither male nor female,</b> Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy originally having been made using the word for <i>dragon</i> in High Valyrian, and dragons, by nature, have no fixed gender. (The lore giving various opinions of if dragons can continually change sex at will or not. The only real way to tell if a dragon is male or female is if it lays eggs or not).\u00a0</p><p>And in the show (<b>Episode 7x02</b>) Missandei says:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>That noun has no gender in High Valyrian.</b> The proper translation for that prophecy would be, \u2018the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.\u2019</i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>So what we have here is not only confusion as to whether or not Azor Ahai reborn is supposed to be the same person as The Prince Who Was Promised, but also <i>gender confusion</i> about <b>The Prince Who Was Promised\u00a0</b>because High Valyrian nouns are not gender specific.</b> On top of which, the show has only talked opening about The Prince Who Was Promised, but made no mention of Azor Ahai and him possibly being reborn <i>as</i> the prince who was promised or not.</p><p>Then of course, also from the books, <b>we have the knowledge that a song was composed for The Prince Who Was Promised</b>, which is called/known as\u00a0\u201cthe song of ice and fire\u201d which Daenerys learns of in her vision in the House of the Undying. (<i>ACOK</i>, <b>Daenerys IV</b>)\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>I\u2019m not the first person to suggest that The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai reborn are two different people</b> and that, between the mistranslations and gender confusion, the two things got mixed up together. But to make it clear, I\u2019d say <b>Azor Ahai is the one who will be reborn via salt and smoke who will wake dragons from stone</b>, and that <b>The Prince Who Was Promised is a separate prophecy, and person, and is the one who \u201cwill bring the dawn.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>So what does this have to do with The Others/White Walkers? Well, this is where more of that that <i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique Martin calls it comes in. In that what if The Prince Who Was Promised was actually promised <i>to</i> something - or someone. Namely, The Others/White Walkers. And what if it was a promise Azor Ahai <i>himself </i>made to them? It would go a ways to explain why the two are always connected to each other</p><p>If you look at the actual history of the First Long Night,\u00a0<b>Azor Ahai never actually\u00a0</b><i><b>defeated</b></i><b> The Others/White Walkers. He and the members of the first Night\u2019s Watch were able to drive them back, and had them flee into the Lands of Always Winter, but they were never defeated completely.</b> Which is why The Wall was built in the first place and The Night\u2019s Watch established - to guard <i>against</i> The Others/White Walkers coming back south and taking over the realms of Men as they did during the First Long Night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be496d497142e862a19df7c6a121b16c/tumblr_inline_pobg04Kybu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\"></figure><p><b>So what if it was Azor Ahai himself who promised this\u00a0\u201cprince\u201d to The Others/White Walker as a way to keep them from trying to invade the realms of Men another time?</b> Again, via both the 13th LC of the NW and Craster, we know making pacts/deals with The Others/White Walkers is possible in some way. <b>So, who is this\u00a0\u201cprince who was promised\u201d? Yeah, I could just say Jon Snow, (because that\u2019s what it likely looks like I\u2019m about to say), but actually no, what if it\u2019s <i>not</i> him? Or, more specifically, what if it was <i>supposed</i> to be him but, once again, the prophecy got slightly misinterpted?</b></p><p>Put a pin in this. We\u2019ll come back to it. For now, let\u2019s go back to the 13th LC and Craster.</p><p>According to Old Nan, the 13th LC was a Stark, meaning he contained the blood of the First Men. <b>The blood of the First Men is thought to carry some magical properties, particularly within the Stark family bloodline, which contain warging and greenseer abilities.</b> And the Stark Kings of old were known as the Kings of Winter. So by the 13th LC likely sacrificing children of his blood that he made with his Night\u2019s Queen, he was providing The Others/White Walkers children that carried a strong magical element in their blood.</p><p><b>Throughout the story and the lore, the Stark are also associated with Ice. Even their Great Valyrian Sword is called simply\u00a0\u201cIce.\u201d\u00a0</b><br></p><p><b>With Craster</b>, <b>things are less certain there wrt the magical elements. </b>Wildlings, which his mother was said to be, are also of the Blood of the First men, but it is not clear if the magical element is a strong among the Wildings as it is with the Starks. <b>The main point, however, is that The Others/White Walkers accepted Craster\u2019s sons as offerings, just as they did from the Night\u2019s King/13th LC. So they were clearly deemed as acceptable in that regard.</b>\u00a0Because, at the very least, they carried the blood of the First Men in them, from Craster\u2019s Wildling mother.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>[<b>Side Note:</b> <b>There is probably going to be a plot-hole in the show wrt Craster\u2019s kids - Gilly\u2019s baby Little Sam specifically. Because, in the books, there is a baby-switching plot going on with Gilly\u2019s baby</b>, (he isn\u2019t named Little Sam in the books, he\u2019s just referred to as\u00a0<i>Monster</i> instead), <b>and Mance Rayder\u2019s baby son.</b> (Yes, Mance has a baby son in the books). Jon more or less forced Gilly to switch her son with Mance\u2019s baby son to try and protect Mance\u2019s son from possibly being killed/burned to death. So that is the fate that might actually befall Gilly\u2019s baby son in the books while Jon is still currently dead, leaving NONE of Craster\u2019s sons alive after that.]\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>So what we have here are two instances of sacrifices to The Others being made and accepted by the Others/White Walkers. And again, the only thing we\u2019ve seen The Others/White Walkers take as a sacrifice are babies.</p><p>Now let\u2019s go back and look at The Prince Who Was Promised and, more specifically, the thing Rhaegar says about the song composed for him, specifically called\u00a0\u201cThe Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d As we all know, that is the actual title of Martin\u2019s book series that the tv show <i>Game of Thrones</i> is based on. And, of course, <b>Jon being the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark have many thinking he is \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised\u201d and the\u00a0\u201csong of ice and fire\u201d because of his blood combination.</b> <b>However, there is another thing in the lore with the title Ice and Fire in it that is being overlooked here </b>that I think is very significant, particularly wrt The Others/White Walkers.</p><p>And that is,<b>\u00a0<i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i></b>.\u00a0</p><p><i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> was a pact forged between House Stark and House Targaryen, (more specifically the black faction of House Targaryen during the Dance of Dragons). <b>As it is described in <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i>, it was an agreement between the two houses that a Stark male would wed a Targaryen Princess.</b> (The recent book<i> Fire and Blood</i> gives more of an account and specifics of <i>who </i>the Princess would be \u2026 or, at least, who her <i>father</i> was supposed to be). The pact, however, was never fulfilled after The Dance ended.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What is the significant part of this is what House Stark was specifically asking for, which was a Targaryen <i>princess</i>. Cregan Stark specifically wanted a young Targaryen\u00a0<i>girl</i> to wed into the Stark family.\u00a0</p><p>As explained above, via both the books/lore and the show, <b>the Starks have a connection to the happenings with The Others/White Walkers.</b>\u00a0We have the story of the 13 Lord Commander/Night\u2019s King. We know about Bran the Builder who, with the help of the Children of the Forest (and giants) helped raise the wall to guard against them invading again.<b> I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to believe that the Kings of Winter of ages past, as the Stark Kings were first called, not only <i>knew</i> about \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised,\u201d but likely also what the true meaning of what this prince/princess\u00a0<i>being</i> promised was all about.</b> That whomever this prince/princess was, when born, they would be given to the The Others, who had been promised to them by\u00a0Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>So what might this have to do with the <i>Pact of Ice and Fire</i> and requesting a Targaryen princess to marry into House Stark? I think a clue comes from Book 2, <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, and Daenerys\u2019 encounter with The Undying in the House of the Undying.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f51c4054946c4c1a6b8cd02f3f7bd89c/tumblr_inline_pobikwIDyK1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p>In ACOK, the Undying Ones are described in a way that has them seeming to be a representation of The Others/White Walkers; with them being described as\u00a0\u201cblue and cold.\u201d And then there is this passage, where they try to consume Daenerys (<b>Daenerys IV, ACOK</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>They wanted her, needed her<b>, the fire, the life, </b>and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them \u2026</i></p><p><i>But then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the <b>indigo air</b>, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany\u2019s gasp turned to horror. <b>The Undying were all around her,</b> <b>blue and cold</b>, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their <b>dry cold hands</b>, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. <b>Even her heart had ceased to beat.</b> She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting \u2026</i></p><p><i><b><i>Then indigo</i></b><i> turned to <b>orange</b>, and whispers turned to screams. <b>Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone</b>, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. <b>Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and</b> <b>tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons</b>, and when his head snapped forward, <b>fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot</b>. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. \u201c</i><br></i></p></blockquote><p>Here we have the Undying, who are described in terms of cold and death, linking them in many way to The Others/White Walkers, trying to consume the fire - which is linked to life - of Daenerys. (And they almost succeeded until Drogon saves her).\u00a0</p><p><b>There is indication that The Undying have been waiting for Daenerys for thousands of years before this moment.</b> <b>They want the lifeforce, <i>the fire</i> that she has, when she finally comes. </b>So what we have here are creatures associated with imagery of - and visually linked to - creatures of death, (The Others/White Walkers), trying to to consume a life,<b><i> the fire</i></b>, from someone of Valyrian descent. <b>Valyrian blood constantly linked to that of fire, and fire, throughout\u00a0the series, is linked to life.</b> House Targaryen\u2019s own words (a house motto they chose when Aegon the Conqueror first began his conquest and wanted his family to adopt more Westerosi culture BTW - they never had a House motto before that) is <i>Fire and Blood</i>, two images also associated with life.\u00a0</p><p><b>Just like The Undying, The Others/White Walkers also appear to be seeking life of some kind.</b> The taking of babies, and then using those babies to create more of their kind by turning them into Others/White Walkers I think ties into this. However, they very well might be something missing from what they seek out of this. A life-force that contains what The Undying were trying to <i>take</i> from Daenerys - <i>a fire</i>.\u00a0</p><p>How is a new life <i>usually</i> created? Male and Female coming together. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nIbFw-brBvw?t=70\"><i>Melisandre alludes to the power of that ability - to create life - in the scene when she tries to seduce Jon in Season 5</i></a> (<b>Episode 5x04</b>) (Start at: 1:10)\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FnIbFw-brBvw%3Ft%3D70\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIbFw-brBvw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>And then of course, there is the quote from the book that she says in this seduction scene (which wasn\u2019t a seduction scene in the book btw), from <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> (<b>Jon VI</b>):\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>The Lord of Light in his wisdom made us male and female, two parts of a greater whole. In our joining there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast shadows.</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the show was being a bit more hard-hitting in the foreshadowing than the book by having Melisandre say these words while appearing to try and <i>seduce</i> Jon. <b>That there is power in the ability - in the <i>act</i> - of men and women coming together and creating life. </b>Unlike The Others/White Walkers, who can only create more of themselves by taking an already living creation - in this case, a child - and turning them into a being like them, a being of the cold.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, even with the power of men and women to do this, The Undying specifically were waiting for and sought out <i>Daenerys</i> for that life, <i>that fire</i>, that they needed. <b>And that may be because, while both male and female coming together can create life and light, it is the <i>female</i> who brings forth that light and life\u00a0<i>into</i> the world via childbirth.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>There is a running theme of motherhood, and what that means, throughout\u00a0Daenerys\u2019 story. She is called Mhysa by the people she liberated from slavery and metaphorically\u00a0giving\u00a0them new life as free\u00a0people. She birthed creatures that are considered to be fire made flesh via</b><i> <b>fire itself</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>I think <i>this</i> is why <i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> called for a Targaryen <i>princess</i> to wed into House Stark. <b>That the need for a joining of Ice and Fire had to specially be that the fruits of that joining, the life created from it, be <i>born</i> of fire; </b>born via a daughter - a female - who carried such fire within her, which those of Valyrian descent do.\u00a0</p><p>And this is where Rhaegar Targaryen made one of his many mistakes when it comes to the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. At some point I do think Rhaegar thought he needed a child who was - bloodline-wise - of\u00a0\u201cice and fire.\u201d <b>Rhaegar had already changed his life twice-over trying to fulfill the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. There is no reason to assume he wouldn\u2019t have done it again if he came into more info about it. </b>For all he did likley love Lyanna, I think it\u2019s probable that he also saw their child as the one who would make this prophecy he\u2019d been chasing most of his life come true \u2026 after first thinking it was about himself, and then thinking it would be about his three children he would (hopefully) have, and the idea that \u201cthe dragon has three heads.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>However, again, Rhaegar was incorrect, not just about what the whole idea of The Prince That Was Promised actually meant, but how the blood combination of Ice and Fire was supposed to be \u2026 or, more specifically, how the child had to be born. <b>Because Lyanna wasn\u2019t fire, or the blood of fire. She was of </b><i><b>ice</b>, </i><b>with the blood of the First Men within her, not the blood of Old Valyria. And the Prince Who Was Promised more than likely\u00a0had to be born of <i>fire</i>, via a female </b><i><b>with the blood of fire</b>.</i></p><p>From <i>A Game of Thrones</i> (<b>Daenerys X</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she wanted to shout to him, no my good knight, do not fear for me. <b>The fire is mine.</b> I am Daenerys Stormborn, <b>daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons</b>, don\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Blood of the Dragon</i> are what those of blood of Old Valyria are called. Dragons are fire made flesh. Those of the blood Old Valyria, the Targaryens, like dragons, are also likely fire made flesh. And <i>fire</i> is life and light.\u00a0</p><p><b>And the coming together of <i>that </i>fire with ice is symbolic of <i>balance.</i></b>\u00a0From <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (<b>Daenerys IV</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI have come for the gift of truth,\u201d Dany said. \u201cIn the long hall, the things I saw \u2026 were they true visions, or lies?

Melisandre\u2019s burning of Shireen Baratheon, which Martin has already confirmed will happen in the books as well, is proof enough of that. \u00a0</p><p>Also, from the recent interview, there is this:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What can we expect from him in the final season?</b></i></p><p><i>People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There\u2019s also that moment [in \u201cHardhome\u201d] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms \u2014 there\u2019s a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time.</i> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>I think it\u2019s pretty clear that that target <i>isn\u2019t </i>Jon Snow. He had more than one opportunity to kill Jon, but proceeded instead to mostly just taunt him.</b> I don\u2019t think the target is Daenerys either, or he could have easily killed Drogon and gotten her when she came beyond the wall in Episode 6 of Season 7.</p><p>The Three-eyed Raven/Crow being the target - with that now being Bran, is an option I admit, however \u2026 the original Three-Eyed Raven/Crow, who was Brynden Rivers aka Bloodraven, had been the Three-Eyed Raven/Crow for many years, and there is little to no indication that The Night King was actively trying to kill him during any of that time.</p><p><b>However, what if the killing of the target doesn\u2019t mean just \u201cto kill,\u201d so much in the sense of what we saw happen to the former Three-Eyed Raven in the show,</b> <b>but is more in the vein of what happened to Daenerys in the House of the Undying in the books, when the Undying tried to take her life-force from her.</b></p><p>And the person they want to do this with is actually the <i>child</i> Daenerys and Jon will/have created?</p><p><b>Because the foreshadowing that Jon and Daenerys will have a child in the coming season was pretty obvious, not to mention Daenerys whole underlying story theme and motif of motherhood. </b>Also, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CczKaabSRfU?t=76\">do not overlook this clip, which HBO chose to highlight before the start of Season 8,</a> where Viserys makes this comment about the child that Dany is set to have with Khal Drogo (<b>Episode 1x06</b>) (Start: 1:16):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCczKaabSRfU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D76\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CczKaabSRfU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><blockquote><p><i>He won\u2019t be a real Targaryen.

(In fact, I think Jon\u2019s going to learn a hard lesson about that when the baby switching plot he instigated wrt Gilly\u2019s baby in the books plays out to a tragic end for Gilly\u2019s baby). <b>If they can find a way to defeat The Others/White Walkers without having to make such a sacrifice and basically taking the easy way out to do so, they may also guarantee that this time, The Others/White Walkers will truly be destroyed and gone forever this time.</b> Instead of what Azor Ahai did, which only seemed to have the go into some kind of slumber and dormancy, and staying in the lands beyond the wall.</p><p><b>However, there may be some among Jon and Daenerys\u2019 army and/or advisors who would want to take the easy route and give the child over to end the conflict quickly</b>, which - while pushing off the problem again for another couple of thousands years - could prevent many people from dying and becoming a part of the Army of the Dead and overrunning Westeros as was what happened during the first Long Night. (Which didn\u2019t stay limited to only Westeros, but spread over almost all of Essos as well).</p><p>In the show, Daenerys\u2019 story has a theme about wanting to\u00a0\u201cbreak the wheel\u201d; the wheel being the nature of the political dynamics of Westeros that benefits the more Noble Classes that fight for power and dominance, symbolized by the Iron Throne, and those who do not benefit from that ongoing struggle, which are the lower classes and smallfolk of Westeros. They are the ones who are always crushed underneath this wheel, this circular nature of the political power fights and wars.\u00a0</p><p><b>However, this idea of\u00a0\u201cbreaking the wheel\u201d may also, in the end, extend to the fight against The Others/White Walkers.</b> As noted, this is not the first time they have invaded the realms of men. And, the last time they did, they were not defeated. The problem they are, the threat they pose, seems to have been pushed off to another generation to have to fight, combat and deal with. And at the center of that fight to do so might just rest with Ice and Fire coming together to create something new. <b>However, the prophecy that has dictated the lives of many people that has lead to this, has never dictated the lives of the two people who may have the most influence in The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy coming to fruition. </b>Neither Jon or Daenerys have lived their lives or made decisions in their lives sorley to fulfil a prophecy. <b>And given what was very likely the <i>weasel-wording</i> technique used for The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy, the fact that they did so may, in the end, be the deciding factor in the breaking of <i>another</i> wheel, another cycle of destruction.</b>\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7a30aee294fcf2ca367f6036e2f18/tumblr_inline_podb5g0cdu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\"></figure></p>",

The Youtube channel Talking Thrones <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA\">posted a video</a> that talks in a few of the same directions I write about here; and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1UHGTGlDDT-LfHGij5Xggg\">@oadara</a> and I discussed a lot of this between us over DM, so much of this comes out of that as well.</p><p>So there are two main prophecies most people focus on when it comes to ASOIAF/GOT, which are:\u00a0</p><p><b>- The prophecy that Maggy the Frog</b> gave to Cersei when she was a girl.\u00a0</p><p><b>- The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai prophecy</b> that talks of a coming hero who will save the world from the coming darkness.</p><p>First, let\u2019s look at <b>what George R. R. Martin himself says about prophecies</b>, particularly in fantasy fiction:</p><blockquote><p><i>Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it\u2019s tricky,\u201d Martin noted. \u201cYou want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way. You want to be unpredictable about it. Shakespeare is the ultimate example of that\u2014when the forest of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Castle, MacBeth will fall. Everybody laughs\u2014how can the forest come to the castle. [Malcolm] came camouflaged with branches and so on. Also, during the War of the Roses, one of the lords was prophesized that he would die at a certain castle. So he always took pains to avoid that castle. But then in the first The Battle of St Albans, he was wounded and died outside a pub that had that castle on its pub sign. <b>You have to look at prophecies carefully and look at the weasel-wording.</b></i>\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>(George R. R. Martin, <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2015/04/12/game-thrones-cersei-flashback/?asdf=&amp;hootPostID=7dbf8334a2e354db75463cc29a0cb5ca\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, 04/12/2015)</p><p>Martin is specifically talking about two types of prophecies here in the examples he gives: the <i><b>self-fulfilling prophecy</b></i> and the <i><b>non-literal prophecy</b></i>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>I think it has become more and more clear that <b>Cersei\u2019s prophecy that she received from Maggy the Frog is headed in the style of a <i>self-fulfilling</i> prophecy. </b>That Cersei, in actively trying to prevent the prophecy from happening, has inevitably caused it <i>to</i> happen.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"615\" data-orig-height=\"342\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0664a2e22a0cd4f01248222187309f56/tumblr_inline_pmhd50VLin1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"615\" data-orig-height=\"342\"></figure><p>Leaving aside the <i>Valonqar</i> part of the prophecy for now, (since the show left it out too), one point of it that people continue to argue over is who the <b>Younger, More Beautiful Queen</b> part of this prophecy refers to. However, in a way, it is actually <i>unimportant</i>. Because with a self-fulfilling prophecy, <b>the YMBQ could have been <i>anyone</i>.</b> Or, at least, any girl who had a realistic chance of becoming Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <b>There was never one designated person it was destined to be</b>. Which means Sansa, Margaery, Daenerys and, adding in the books, you can probably place Arianne Martell in the group as well, each could have been the YMBQ. <b>The important part is/was how <i>Cersei reacted</i> to the threat of each of these women to BE the YMBQ</b>, NOT who the woman actually <i>was</i>. Because again, <i>it could have been any one of them.</i>\u00a0</p><p>For those who know Harry Potter, it is very much in line with Voldemort hearing that the person who can defeat him will be born \u201cas the seventh month dies.\u201d As HP book readers know, there were <i>two</i> boys born at the end of July - Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. It was Voldemort <i>himself</i> who picked Harry as the Chosen One when he went to kill him in Godric\u2019s Hollow on that Halloween night. However, it could have just as easily <i>not</i> been Harry if Voldemort had picked and gone to kill Neville instead. <i>Voldemort</i> chose his rival, not fate or destiny.</p><p><b>I think the YMBQ part of Cersei\u2019s prophecy is the same type of self-fulfilling\u00a0prophecy that we see in Harry Potter, where <i>Voldemort</i> <i>chose</i> his rival, but with a slight twist</b>.\u00a0With Sansa and Margaery both, Cersei <i>recognized</i> them as threats, as the potential YMBQ of the prophecy she got, and worked to neutralize them as such in any way she could think of. <b>However, the YMBQ has very likely become the person who Cersei <i>didn\u2019t</i> think of as a threat and work to stop from being one until it was actually too late: Daenerys.</b> (Though I do think Arianne Martell still might have chance to be this in the books in some way, even possibly jointly along with Daenerys, since we don\u2019t know the direction\u00a0Arianne\u2019s story will go in relation to Cersei in the books). <b>One of the underlying story threads of both the books and the show is how no one in Westeros is paying/paid all that much attention to Dany and the possible threat she poses</b>,<b> particularly to the Lannisters</b> \u2026 and possibly to Cersei herself. <b>Not until it\u2019s looking to be too late to really do anything about it.</b> Not until <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> at least, (as far as the books go), when it is now possibly too late to stop her from being one.\u00a0</p><p>Which makes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=101\">the scene in the show of <i>Joffrey</i> of all people recognizing the threat she is so early on drip with irony</a>. (Start at 1:42)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dtk5hKomP4MA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D101\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tk5hKomP4MA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p><b><i>Cersei</i> <i>chose</i> who the YMBQ was, by <i>not</i> choosing to see the threat one of the candidates presented to her.</b> Like Voldemort did, Cersei has/is choosing the instruments of her own destruction, and making the prophecy come true, especially by living her life actively engaging with her prophecy and trying to prevent it. </p><p>And from the little we know of him via the books and lore, this appears to have also been Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s downfall as well, actively engaging and living his life based on a prophecy. <b>However, in Rhaegar\u2019s case, the prophecy doesn\u2019t look to be self-fulfilling so much as being a <i>non-literal</i> prophecy.</b> Non-literal prophecies are way more tricky to engage in and with, and may actually <i>lead to</i> the event that the prophecy says is destined to be <i>stopped</i>. \u00a0</p><p>We see a version of this type of prophecy (awkwardly done) in the Star Wars prequels. \u201cAnakin Skywalker is destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to The Force.\u201d Which yes,\u00a0Anakin\u00a0<i>did</i> destroy the Sith; but only <i>after</i> he helped the Sith to destroy the Jedi and became a Sith Lord <i>himself</i>. (Which then brought balance to the force after he killed Palpatine and then he - as Vader - died as well because then the only one left was Jedi Luke, I guess? Again, I said it was <i>awkwardly</i> done, not perfectly done). So yes, if you look at that prophecy literally, Anakin Skywalker <i>did </i>destroy the Sith. It was just the nature of <i><b>why</b></i> and <i><b>how</b></i> this prophecy would come to be true and be fulfilled that was what was missing: that Anakin would help to wipe out the Jedi <i>first </i>BEFORE destroying the Sith.\u00a0</p><p>A better example of this, with the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique used that Martin mentions above, is another example from the Shakespeare play <i>Macbeth,</i>\u00a0and the character of Macduff. Macbeth is told by the three witches that\u00a0\u201cno man of woman born\u201d can kill him, so Macbeth goes though the play thinking that he can not be killed by any man. Turns out, however, that\u00a0Macduff was actually born via a medieval version of a c-section:</p><blockquote><p><i>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br>Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb <br>Untimely ripped\u00a0\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>So Macduff technically wasn\u2019t \u201cborn\u201d in the traditional sense as known of at that time. And so yes, Macduff is the one who ultimately kills Macbeth.</p><p>And I think <i>that</i> is that type of prophecy - <b>one of non-literal interpretation - is what we are looking at when it comes to the prophecy in ASOIAF/GOT about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai.</b>\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Let me start by pointing out: <i><b>there is no Night King in the books</b></i>. In the lore of the world there is a <i>Night\u2019s</i> King (possessive S), <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King\">who was this guy</a>:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af4ccfc39d1a4389fa35961de3fc3307/tumblr_inline_pmhek7SlTL1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p><b>The 13th Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch</b>. Bran mentions him in <i>A Storm of Swords,</i> and <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> talks about him as well. It is said that he was a Stark, possibly the brother of the then-current King of Winter. <b>In brief, his story was thus:</b> he saw a woman for atop the wall one night\u00a0\"with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.\u201c He fell in love with her even though\u00a0\"her skin was cold as ice\u201d and, when he gave her his seed, he gave her his soul as well. <b>With her, he claimed the Nightfort as his castle and declared himself as King and her his Queen. There, he ruled for 13 years until the King of Winter and the King-Beyond-The-Wall brought him down</b>.\u00a0</p><p>As far as we know so far, the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King has no relation or connection to <i>this</i> guy from the show, known as the <i>Night</i> King (no possessive S):</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7e66568595e90042da76e31f0b0f0/tumblr_inline_pmiqnj3dKZ1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"></figure><p>Not least of which because <b>their backstories are compelty different.</b> The Night King of the show was created by the Children of the Forest for their war against the First Men, which clearly happened years - if not decades - before the end of the first Long Night (which, itself, lasted a generation), the construction of The Wall and the formation of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m bringing up the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King and <i>Night</i> King difference - and that the Night King is show-only - because of one particular story point with regards to the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King that I don\u2019t want anyone confusing with the <i>Night</i> King of the show. And that is: when the Night\u2019s King was finally brought down, it was discovered that he had been making sacrifices to The Others, aka the White Walkers. The lore never <i>directly</i> says what type of sacrifices he was making to them.<b> However, given what we\u2019ve seen presented in both the books and the show, there appears to only be one type of sacrifices The Others/White Walkers have ever appeared to take: human babies.</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in both the books and the show, Craster was somehow able to negotiate with The Others/White Walkers to make an agreement to sacrifice his own sons to them. So it doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a stretch to assume that the Night\u2019s King was able to make some similar type of deal to sacrifice any children he made with his Queen to them as well.\u00a0</p><p><b>So what do The Others/White Walkers want?<i>\u00a0We already know what they want. </i>The books, the lore and the show have all already told us, and even </b><i><b>shown</b></i><b> us, what\u00a0they want.</b> Twice now, they have made deals and taken human sacrifices - babies - and left the places south of the wall alone when they have received such things. There is no reason to believe that they would never do so again. <b>We just don\u2019t know <i>why</i> they want what they do, which is a different question than asking <i>what</i> they want.\u00a0</b></p><p>So, knowing this, how might this tie into the prophecy of\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First off, in the books, the wording of the prophecy falls very much into the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique that Martin himself talks about. Because the person who speaks the most about the prophecy, Melisandre, talks about the prophecy being about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised <i>and</i> Azor Ahai <i>interchangeably</i>. Her talking about the prophecy in this way gives the impression that\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai are one-in-the-same, and one is just another name for the other.</p><p><b>However, what if that is not the case.</b> Now, it\u2019s complicated because the show has never either mentioned nor referred to\u00a0Azor Ahai, (except for possibly as just an easter egg in a book Gilly is seen reading in S7), but has used the wording more associated with\u00a0Azor Ahai to talk about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised.\u00a0</p><p>Another problem is that there is no one-description of what the prophecy actually <i>is</i>. In <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Davos III</b>),\u00a0Melisandre says this:</p><blockquote><p><i>When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.</i>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Pretty straight forward. But again,<b> this talks about\u00a0Azor Ahai being reborn and how, <i>not </i>saying anything about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised, or them being the same person.</b>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>And then, of course, there is the gender pronoun confusion</b>, which is mentioned both in the books and the show,<b> both</b> <b>dealing with the mistranslation about The Prince Who Was Promised</b>. Maester Aemon in <i>A Feast For Crows</i>\u00a0(<b>Samwell IV</b>) says:</p><blockquote><p><i>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. <b>Dragons are neither male nor female,</b> Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy originally having been made using the word for <i>dragon</i> in High Valyrian, and dragons, by nature, have no fixed gender. (The lore giving various opinions of if dragons can continually change sex at will or not. The only real way to tell if a dragon is male or female is if it lays eggs or not).\u00a0</p><p>And in the show (<b>Episode 7x02</b>) Missandei says:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>That noun has no gender in High Valyrian.</b> The proper translation for that prophecy would be, \u2018the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.\u2019</i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>So what we have here is not only confusion as to whether or not Azor Ahai reborn is supposed to be the same person as The Prince Who Was Promised, but also <i>gender confusion</i> about <b>The Prince Who Was Promised\u00a0</b>because High Valyrian nouns are not gender specific.</b> On top of which, the show has only talked opening about The Prince Who Was Promised, but made no mention of Azor Ahai and him possibly being reborn <i>as</i> the prince who was promised or not.</p><p>Then of course, also from the books, <b>we have the knowledge that a song was composed for The Prince Who Was Promised</b>, which is called/known as\u00a0\u201cthe song of ice and fire\u201d which Daenerys learns of in her vision in the House of the Undying. (<i>ACOK</i>, <b>Daenerys IV</b>)\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>I\u2019m not the first person to suggest that The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai reborn are two different people</b> and that, between the mistranslations and gender confusion, the two things got mixed up together. But to make it clear, I\u2019d say <b>Azor Ahai is the one who will be reborn via salt and smoke who will wake dragons from stone</b>, and that <b>The Prince Who Was Promised is a separate prophecy, and person, and is the one who \u201cwill bring the dawn.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>So what does this have to do with The Others/White Walkers? Well, this is where more of that that <i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique Martin calls it comes in. In that what if The Prince Who Was Promised was actually promised <i>to</i> something - or someone. Namely, The Others/White Walkers. And what if it was a promise Azor Ahai <i>himself </i>made to them? It would go a ways to explain why the two are always connected to each other</p><p>If you look at the actual history of the First Long Night,\u00a0<b>Azor Ahai never actually\u00a0</b><i><b>defeated</b></i><b> The Others/White Walkers. He and the members of the first Night\u2019s Watch were able to drive them back, and had them flee into the Lands of Always Winter, but they were never defeated completely.</b> Which is why The Wall was built in the first place and The Night\u2019s Watch established - to guard <i>against</i> The Others/White Walkers coming back south and taking over the realms of Men as they did during the First Long Night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be496d497142e862a19df7c6a121b16c/tumblr_inline_pobg04Kybu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\"></figure><p><b>So what if it was Azor Ahai himself who promised this\u00a0\u201cprince\u201d to The Others/White Walker as a way to keep them from trying to invade the realms of Men another time?</b> Again, via both the 13th LC of the NW and Craster, we know making pacts/deals with The Others/White Walkers is possible in some way. <b>So, who is this\u00a0\u201cprince who was promised\u201d? Yeah, I could just say Jon Snow, (because that\u2019s what it likely looks like I\u2019m about to say), but actually no, what if it\u2019s <i>not</i> him? Or, more specifically, what if it was <i>supposed</i> to be him but, once again, the prophecy got slightly misinterpted?</b></p><p>Put a pin in this. We\u2019ll come back to it. For now, let\u2019s go back to the 13th LC and Craster.</p><p>According to Old Nan, the 13th LC was a Stark, meaning he contained the blood of the First Men. <b>The blood of the First Men is thought to carry some magical properties, particularly within the Stark family bloodline, which contain warging and greenseer abilities.</b> And the Stark Kings of old were known as the Kings of Winter. So by the 13th LC likely sacrificing children of his blood that he made with his Night\u2019s Queen, he was providing The Others/White Walkers children that carried a strong magical element in their blood.</p><p><b>Throughout the story and the lore, the Stark are also associated with Ice. Even their Great Valyrian Sword is called simply\u00a0\u201cIce.\u201d\u00a0</b><br></p><p><b>With Craster</b>, <b>things are less certain there wrt the magical elements. </b>Wildlings, which his mother was said to be, are also of the Blood of the First men, but it is not clear if the magical element is a strong among the Wildings as it is with the Starks. <b>The main point, however, is that The Others/White Walkers accepted Craster\u2019s sons as offerings, just as they did from the Night\u2019s King/13th LC. So they were clearly deemed as acceptable in that regard.</b>\u00a0Because, at the very least, they carried the blood of the First Men in them, from Craster\u2019s Wildling mother.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>[<b>Side Note:</b> <b>There is probably going to be a plot-hole in the show wrt Craster\u2019s kids - Gilly\u2019s baby Little Sam specifically. Because, in the books, there is a baby-switching plot going on with Gilly\u2019s baby</b>, (he isn\u2019t named Little Sam in the books, he\u2019s just referred to as\u00a0<i>Monster</i> instead), <b>and Mance Rayder\u2019s baby son.</b> (Yes, Mance has a baby son in the books). Jon more or less forced Gilly to switch her son with Mance\u2019s baby son to try and protect Mance\u2019s son from possibly being killed/burned to death. So that is the fate that might actually befall Gilly\u2019s baby son in the books while Jon is still currently dead, leaving NONE of Craster\u2019s sons alive after that.]\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>So what we have here are two instances of sacrifices to The Others being made and accepted by the Others/White Walkers. And again, the only thing we\u2019ve seen The Others/White Walkers take as a sacrifice are babies.</p><p>Now let\u2019s go back and look at The Prince Who Was Promised and, more specifically, the thing Rhaegar says about the song composed for him, specifically called\u00a0\u201cThe Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d As we all know, that is the actual title of Martin\u2019s book series that the tv show <i>Game of Thrones</i> is based on. And, of course, <b>Jon being the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark have many thinking he is \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised\u201d and the\u00a0\u201csong of ice and fire\u201d because of his blood combination.</b> <b>However, there is another thing in the lore with the title Ice and Fire in it that is being overlooked here </b>that I think is very significant, particularly wrt The Others/White Walkers.</p><p>And that is,<b>\u00a0<i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i></b>.\u00a0</p><p><i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> was a pact forged between House Stark and House Targaryen, (more specifically the black faction of House Targaryen during the Dance of Dragons). <b>As it is described in <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i>, it was an agreement between the two houses that a Stark male would wed a Targaryen Princess.</b> (The recent book<i> Fire and Blood</i> gives more of an account and specifics of <i>who </i>the Princess would be \u2026 or, at least, who her <i>father</i> was supposed to be). The pact, however, was never fulfilled after The Dance ended.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What is the significant part of this is what House Stark was specifically asking for, which was a Targaryen <i>princess</i>. Cregan Stark specifically wanted a young Targaryen\u00a0<i>girl</i> to wed into the Stark family.\u00a0</p><p>As explained above, via both the books/lore and the show, <b>the Starks have a connection to the happenings with The Others/White Walkers.</b>\u00a0We have the story of the 13 Lord Commander/Night\u2019s King. We know about Bran the Builder who, with the help of the Children of the Forest (and giants) helped raise the wall to guard against them invading again.<b> I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to believe that the Kings of Winter of ages past, as the Stark Kings were first called, not only <i>knew</i> about \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised,\u201d but likely also what the true meaning of what this prince/princess\u00a0<i>being</i> promised was all about.</b> That whomever this prince/princess was, when born, they would be given to the The Others, who had been promised to them by\u00a0Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>So what might this have to do with the <i>Pact of Ice and Fire</i> and requesting a Targaryen princess to marry into House Stark? I think a clue comes from Book 2, <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, and Daenerys\u2019 encounter with The Undying in the House of the Undying.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f51c4054946c4c1a6b8cd02f3f7bd89c/tumblr_inline_pobikwIDyK1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p>In ACOK, the Undying Ones are described in a way that has them seeming to be a representation of The Others/White Walkers; with them being described as\u00a0\u201cblue and cold.\u201d And then there is this passage, where they try to consume Daenerys (<b>Daenerys IV, ACOK</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>They wanted her, needed her<b>, the fire, the life, </b>and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them \u2026</i></p><p><i>But then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the <b>indigo air</b>, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany\u2019s gasp turned to horror. <b>The Undying were all around her,</b> <b>blue and cold</b>, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their <b>dry cold hands</b>, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. <b>Even her heart had ceased to beat.</b> She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting \u2026</i></p><p><i><b><i>Then indigo</i></b><i> turned to <b>orange</b>, and whispers turned to screams. <b>Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone</b>, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. <b>Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and</b> <b>tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons</b>, and when his head snapped forward, <b>fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot</b>. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. \u201c</i><br></i></p></blockquote><p>Here we have the Undying, who are described in terms of cold and death, linking them in many way to The Others/White Walkers, trying to consume the fire - which is linked to life - of Daenerys. (And they almost succeeded until Drogon saves her).\u00a0</p><p><b>There is indication that The Undying have been waiting for Daenerys for thousands of years before this moment.</b> <b>They want the lifeforce, <i>the fire</i> that she has, when she finally comes. </b>So what we have here are creatures associated with imagery of - and visually linked to - creatures of death, (The Others/White Walkers), trying to to consume a life,<b><i> the fire</i></b>, from someone of Valyrian descent. <b>Valyrian blood constantly linked to that of fire, and fire, throughout\u00a0the series, is linked to life.</b> House Targaryen\u2019s own words (a house motto they chose when Aegon the Conqueror first began his conquest and wanted his family to adopt more Westerosi culture BTW - they never had a House motto before that) is <i>Fire and Blood</i>, two images also associated with life.\u00a0</p><p><b>Just like The Undying, The Others/White Walkers also appear to be seeking life of some kind.</b> The taking of babies, and then using those babies to create more of their kind by turning them into Others/White Walkers I think ties into this. However, they very well might be something missing from what they seek out of this. A life-force that contains what The Undying were trying to <i>take</i> from Daenerys - <i>a fire</i>.\u00a0</p><p>How is a new life <i>usually</i> created? Male and Female coming together. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nIbFw-brBvw?t=70\"><i>Melisandre alludes to the power of that ability - to create life - in the scene when she tries to seduce Jon in Season 5</i></a> (<b>Episode 5x04</b>) (Start at: 1:10)\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FnIbFw-brBvw%3Ft%3D70\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIbFw-brBvw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>And then of course, there is the quote from the book that she says in this seduction scene (which wasn\u2019t a seduction scene in the book btw), from <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> (<b>Jon VI</b>):\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>The Lord of Light in his wisdom made us male and female, two parts of a greater whole. In our joining there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast shadows.</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the show was being a bit more hard-hitting in the foreshadowing than the book by having Melisandre say these words while appearing to try and <i>seduce</i> Jon. <b>That there is power in the ability - in the <i>act</i> - of men and women coming together and creating life. </b>Unlike The Others/White Walkers, who can only create more of themselves by taking an already living creation - in this case, a child - and turning them into a being like them, a being of the cold.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, even with the power of men and women to do this, The Undying specifically were waiting for and sought out <i>Daenerys</i> for that life, <i>that fire</i>, that they needed. <b>And that may be because, while both male and female coming together can create life and light, it is the <i>female</i> who brings forth that light and life\u00a0<i>into</i> the world via childbirth.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>There is a running theme of motherhood, and what that means, throughout\u00a0Daenerys\u2019 story. She is called Mhysa by the people she liberated from slavery and metaphorically\u00a0giving\u00a0them new life as free\u00a0people. She birthed creatures that are considered to be fire made flesh via</b><i> <b>fire itself</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>I think <i>this</i> is why <i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> called for a Targaryen <i>princess</i> to wed into House Stark. <b>That the need for a joining of Ice and Fire had to specially be that the fruits of that joining, the life created from it, be <i>born</i> of fire; </b>born via a daughter - a female - who carried such fire within her, which those of Valyrian descent do.\u00a0</p><p>And this is where Rhaegar Targaryen made one of his many mistakes when it comes to the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. At some point I do think Rhaegar thought he needed a child who was - bloodline-wise - of\u00a0\u201cice and fire.\u201d <b>Rhaegar had already changed his life twice-over trying to fulfill the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. There is no reason to assume he wouldn\u2019t have done it again if he came into more info about it. </b>For all he did likley love Lyanna, I think it\u2019s probable that he also saw their child as the one who would make this prophecy he\u2019d been chasing most of his life come true \u2026 after first thinking it was about himself, and then thinking it would be about his three children he would (hopefully) have, and the idea that \u201cthe dragon has three heads.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>However, again, Rhaegar was incorrect, not just about what the whole idea of The Prince That Was Promised actually meant, but how the blood combination of Ice and Fire was supposed to be \u2026 or, more specifically, how the child had to be born. <b>Because Lyanna wasn\u2019t fire, or the blood of fire. She was of </b><i><b>ice</b>, </i><b>with the blood of the First Men within her, not the blood of Old Valyria. And the Prince Who Was Promised more than likely\u00a0had to be born of <i>fire</i>, via a female </b><i><b>with the blood of fire</b>.</i></p><p>From <i>A Game of Thrones</i> (<b>Daenerys X</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she wanted to shout to him, no my good knight, do not fear for me. <b>The fire is mine.</b> I am Daenerys Stormborn, <b>daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons</b>, don\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Blood of the Dragon</i> are what those of blood of Old Valyria are called. Dragons are fire made flesh. Those of the blood Old Valyria, the Targaryens, like dragons, are also likely fire made flesh. And <i>fire</i> is life and light.\u00a0</p><p><b>And the coming together of <i>that </i>fire with ice is symbolic of <i>balance.</i></b>\u00a0From <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (<b>Daenerys IV</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI have come for the gift of truth,\u201d Dany said. \u201cIn the long hall, the things I saw \u2026 were they true visions, or lies?

Nobody knows who he was before \u2014 a soldier or part of [nobility]. He never wanted to be the Night King. I think he wants revenge. Everybody in this story has two sides \u2014 a bad side and a good side. The Night King only has one side, a bad side.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>Thinking the Night King wants revenge isn\u2019t the same as that being what he definitely wants. <b>However, the idea that the Night King only has a bad side seems to fit with the view of what The Great Other is and represents in the books/lore, which is the god of darkness and death. </b>However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that cut and dry even via what The Great Other/Night King is. Because evil acts can be committed by those who fight for the light, such as good acts can likely be committed by those who fight for darkness/death. Melisandre\u2019s burning of Shireen Baratheon, which Martin has already confirmed will happen in the books as well, is proof enough of that. \u00a0</p><p>Also, from the recent interview, there is this:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What can we expect from him in the final season?</b></i></p><p><i>People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There\u2019s also that moment [in \u201cHardhome\u201d] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms \u2014 there\u2019s a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time.</i> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>I think it\u2019s pretty clear that that target <i>isn\u2019t </i>Jon Snow.

(In fact, I think Jon\u2019s going to learn a hard lesson about that when the baby switching plot he instigated wrt Gilly\u2019s baby in the books plays out to a tragic end for Gilly\u2019s baby). <b>If they can find a way to defeat The Others/White Walkers without having to make such a sacrifice and basically taking the easy way out to do so, they may also guarantee that this time, The Others/White Walkers will truly be destroyed and gone forever this time.</b> Instead of what Azor Ahai did, which only seemed to have the go into some kind of slumber and dormancy, and staying in the lands beyond the wall.</p><p><b>However, there may be some among Jon and Daenerys\u2019 army and/or advisors who would want to take the easy route and give the child over to end the conflict quickly</b>, which - while pushing off the problem again for another couple of thousands years - could prevent many people from dying and becoming a part of the Army of the Dead and overrunning Westeros as was what happened during the first Long Night. (Which didn\u2019t stay limited to only Westeros, but spread over almost all of Essos as well).</p><p>In the show, Daenerys\u2019 story has a theme about wanting to\u00a0\u201cbreak the wheel\u201d; the wheel being the nature of the political dynamics of Westeros that benefits the more Noble Classes that fight for power and dominance, symbolized by the Iron Throne, and those who do not benefit from that ongoing struggle, which are the lower classes and smallfolk of Westeros.

And, the last time they did, they were not defeated. The problem they are, the threat they pose, seems to have been pushed off to another generation to have to fight, combat and deal with. And at the center of that fight to do so might just rest with Ice and Fire coming together to create something new. <b>However, the prophecy that has dictated the lives of many people that has lead to this, has never dictated the lives of the two people who may have the most influence in The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy coming to fruition. </b>Neither Jon or Daenerys have lived their lives or made decisions in their lives sorley to fulfil a prophecy. <b>And given what was very likely the <i>weasel-wording</i> technique used for The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy, the fact that they did so may, in the end, be the deciding factor in the breaking of <i>another</i> wheel, another cycle of destruction.</b>\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7a30aee294fcf2ca367f6036e2f18/tumblr_inline_podb5g0cdu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\"></figure></p>",

The Youtube channel Talking Thrones <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA\">posted a video</a> that talks in a few of the same directions I write about here; and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1UHGTGlDDT-LfHGij5Xggg\">@oadara</a> and I discussed a lot of this between us over DM, so much of this comes out of that as well.</p><p>So there are two main prophecies most people focus on when it comes to ASOIAF/GOT, which are:&nbsp;</p><p><b>- The prophecy that Maggy the Frog</b> gave to Cersei when she was a girl.&nbsp;</p><p><b>- The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai prophecy</b> that talks of a coming hero who will save the world from the coming darkness.</p><p>First, let&rsquo;s look at <b>what George R. R. Martin himself says about prophecies</b>, particularly in fantasy fiction:</p><blockquote><p><i>Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it&rsquo;s tricky,&rdquo; Martin noted. &ldquo;You want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way. You want to be unpredictable about it. Shakespeare is the ultimate example of that&mdash;when the forest of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Castle, MacBeth will fall. Everybody laughs&mdash;how can the forest come to the castle. [Malcolm] came camouflaged with branches and so on. Also, during the War of the Roses, one of the lords was prophesized that he would die at a certain castle. So he always took pains to avoid that castle. But then in the first The Battle of St Albans, he was wounded and died outside a pub that had that castle on its pub sign. <b>You have to look at prophecies carefully and look at the weasel-wording.</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>(George R. R. Martin, <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2015/04/12/game-thrones-cersei-flashback/?asdf=&amp;hootPostID=7dbf8334a2e354db75463cc29a0cb5ca\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, 04/12/2015)</p><p>Martin is specifically talking about two types of prophecies here in the examples he gives: the <i><b>self-fulfilling prophecy</b></i> and the <i><b>non-literal prophecy</b></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I think it has become more and more clear that <b>Cersei&rsquo;s prophecy that she received from Maggy the Frog is headed in the style of a <i>self-fulfilling</i> prophecy. </b>That Cersei, in actively trying to prevent the prophecy from happening, has inevitably caused it <i>to</i> happen.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0664a2e22a0cd4f01248222187309f56/tumblr_inline_pmhd50VLin1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Leaving aside the <i>Valonqar</i> part of the prophecy for now, (since the show left it out too), one point of it that people continue to argue over is who the <b>Younger, More Beautiful Queen</b> part of this prophecy refers to. However, in a way, it is actually <i>unimportant</i>. Because with a self-fulfilling prophecy, <b>the YMBQ could have been <i>anyone</i>.</b> Or, at least, any girl who had a realistic chance of becoming Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <b>There was never one designated person it was destined to be</b>. Which means Sansa, Margaery, Daenerys and, adding in the books, you can probably place Arianne Martell in the group as well, each could have been the YMBQ. <b>The important part is/was how <i>Cersei reacted</i> to the threat of each of these women to BE the YMBQ</b>, NOT who the woman actually <i>was</i>. Because again, <i>it could have been any one of them.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>For those who know Harry Potter, it is very much in line with Voldemort hearing that the person who can defeat him will be born &ldquo;as the seventh month dies.&rdquo; As HP book readers know, there were <i>two</i> boys born at the end of July - Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. It was Voldemort <i>himself</i> who picked Harry as the Chosen One when he went to kill him in Godric&rsquo;s Hollow on that Halloween night. However, it could have just as easily <i>not</i> been Harry if Voldemort had picked and gone to kill Neville instead. <i>Voldemort</i> chose his rival, not fate or destiny.</p><p><b>I think the YMBQ part of Cersei&rsquo;s prophecy is the same type of self-fulfilling&nbsp;prophecy that we see in Harry Potter, where <i>Voldemort</i> <i>chose</i> his rival, but with a slight twist</b>.&nbsp;With Sansa and Margaery both, Cersei <i>recognized</i> them as threats, as the potential YMBQ of the prophecy she got, and worked to neutralize them as such in any way she could think of. <b>However, the YMBQ has very likely become the person who Cersei <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> think of as a threat and work to stop from being one until it was actually too late: Daenerys.</b> (Though I do think Arianne Martell still might have chance to be this in the books in some way, even possibly jointly along with Daenerys, since we don&rsquo;t know the direction&nbsp;Arianne&rsquo;s story will go in relation to Cersei in the books). <b>One of the underlying story threads of both the books and the show is how no one in Westeros is paying/paid all that much attention to Dany and the possible threat she poses</b>,<b> particularly to the Lannisters</b> &hellip; and possibly to Cersei herself. <b>Not until it&rsquo;s looking to be too late to really do anything about it.</b> Not until <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> at least, (as far as the books go), when it is now possibly too late to stop her from being one.&nbsp;</p><p>Which makes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=101\">the scene in the show of <i>Joffrey</i> of all people recognizing the threat she is so early on drip with irony</a>. (Start at 1:42)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p><b><i>Cersei</i> <i>chose</i> who the YMBQ was, by <i>not</i> choosing to see the threat one of the candidates presented to her.</b> Like Voldemort did, Cersei has/is choosing the instruments of her own destruction, and making the prophecy come true, especially by living her life actively engaging with her prophecy and trying to prevent it. </p><p>And from the little we know of him via the books and lore, this appears to have also been Rhaegar Targaryen&rsquo;s downfall as well, actively engaging and living his life based on a prophecy. <b>However, in Rhaegar&rsquo;s case, the prophecy doesn&rsquo;t look to be self-fulfilling so much as being a <i>non-literal</i> prophecy.</b> Non-literal prophecies are way more tricky to engage in and with, and may actually <i>lead to</i> the event that the prophecy says is destined to be <i>stopped</i>. &nbsp;</p><p>We see a version of this type of prophecy (awkwardly done) in the Star Wars prequels. &ldquo;Anakin Skywalker is destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to The Force.&rdquo; Which yes,&nbsp;Anakin&nbsp;<i>did</i> destroy the Sith; but only <i>after</i> he helped the Sith to destroy the Jedi and became a Sith Lord <i>himself</i>. (Which then brought balance to the force after he killed Palpatine and then he - as Vader - died as well because then the only one left was Jedi Luke, I guess? Again, I said it was <i>awkwardly</i> done, not perfectly done). So yes, if you look at that prophecy literally, Anakin Skywalker <i>did </i>destroy the Sith. It was just the nature of <i><b>why</b></i> and <i><b>how</b></i> this prophecy would come to be true and be fulfilled that was what was missing: that Anakin would help to wipe out the Jedi <i>first </i>BEFORE destroying the Sith.&nbsp;</p><p>A better example of this, with the&nbsp;<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique used that Martin mentions above, is another example from the Shakespeare play <i>Macbeth,</i>&nbsp;and the character of Macduff. Macbeth is told by the three witches that&nbsp;&ldquo;no man of woman born&rdquo; can kill him, so Macbeth goes though the play thinking that he can not be killed by any man. Turns out, however, that&nbsp;Macduff was actually born via a medieval version of a c-section:</p><blockquote><p><i>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br />Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother&rsquo;s womb <br />Untimely ripped&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>So Macduff technically wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;born&rdquo; in the traditional sense as known of at that time. And so yes, Macduff is the one who ultimately kills Macbeth.</p><p>And I think <i>that</i> is that type of prophecy - <b>one of non-literal interpretation - is what we are looking at when it comes to the prophecy in ASOIAF/GOT about&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Let me start by pointing out: <i><b>there is no Night King in the books</b></i>. In the lore of the world there is a <i>Night&rsquo;s</i> King (possessive S), <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King\">who was this guy</a>:</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af4ccfc39d1a4389fa35961de3fc3307/tumblr_inline_pmhek7SlTL1qi5869_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>The 13th Lord Commander of the Night&rsquo;s Watch</b>. Bran mentions him in <i>A Storm of Swords,</i> and <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> talks about him as well. It is said that he was a Stark, possibly the brother of the then-current King of Winter. <b>In brief, his story was thus:</b> he saw a woman for atop the wall one night&nbsp;\"with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.&ldquo; He fell in love with her even though&nbsp;\"her skin was cold as ice&rdquo; and, when he gave her his seed, he gave her his soul as well. <b>With her, he claimed the Nightfort as his castle and declared himself as King and her his Queen. There, he ruled for 13 years until the King of Winter and the King-Beyond-The-Wall brought him down</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as we know so far, the <i>Night&rsquo;s</i> King has no relation or connection to <i>this</i> guy from the show, known as the <i>Night</i> King (no possessive S):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7e66568595e90042da76e31f0b0f0/tumblr_inline_pmiqnj3dKZ1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Not least of which because <b>their backstories are compelty different.</b> The Night King of the show was created by the Children of the Forest for their war against the First Men, which clearly happened years - if not decades - before the end of the first Long Night (which, itself, lasted a generation), the construction of The Wall and the formation of the Night&rsquo;s Watch.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m bringing up the <i>Night&rsquo;s</i> King and <i>Night</i> King difference - and that the Night King is show-only - because of one particular story point with regards to the <i>Night&rsquo;s</i> King that I don&rsquo;t want anyone confusing with the <i>Night</i> King of the show. And that is: when the Night&rsquo;s King was finally brought down, it was discovered that he had been making sacrifices to The Others, aka the White Walkers. The lore never <i>directly</i> says what type of sacrifices he was making to them.<b> However, given what we&rsquo;ve seen presented in both the books and the show, there appears to only be one type of sacrifices The Others/White Walkers have ever appeared to take: human babies.</b></p><p>As we&rsquo;ve seen in both the books and the show, Craster was somehow able to negotiate with The Others/White Walkers to make an agreement to sacrifice his own sons to them. So it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be much of a stretch to assume that the Night&rsquo;s King was able to make some similar type of deal to sacrifice any children he made with his Queen to them as well.&nbsp;</p><p><b>So what do The Others/White Walkers want?<i>&nbsp;We already know what they want. </i>The books, the lore and the show have all already told us, and even </b><i><b>shown</b></i><b> us, what&nbsp;they want.</b> Twice now, they have made deals and taken human sacrifices - babies - and left the places south of the wall alone when they have received such things. There is no reason to believe that they would never do so again. <b>We just don&rsquo;t know <i>why</i> they want what they do, which is a different question than asking <i>what</i> they want.&nbsp;</b></p><p>So, knowing this, how might this tie into the prophecy of&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First off, in the books, the wording of the prophecy falls very much into the&nbsp;<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique that Martin himself talks about. Because the person who speaks the most about the prophecy, Melisandre, talks about the prophecy being about&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised <i>and</i> Azor Ahai <i>interchangeably</i>. Her talking about the prophecy in this way gives the impression that&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai are one-in-the-same, and one is just another name for the other.</p><p><b>However, what if that is not the case.</b> Now, it&rsquo;s complicated because the show has never either mentioned nor referred to&nbsp;Azor Ahai, (except for possibly as just an easter egg in a book Gilly is seen reading in S7), but has used the wording more associated with&nbsp;Azor Ahai to talk about&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised.&nbsp;</p><p>Another problem is that there is no one-description of what the prophecy actually <i>is</i>. In <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Davos III</b>),&nbsp;Melisandre says this:</p><blockquote><p><i>When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.</i>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Pretty straight forward. But again,<b> this talks about&nbsp;Azor Ahai being reborn and how, <i>not </i>saying anything about&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised, or them being the same person.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>And then, of course, there is the gender pronoun confusion</b>, which is mentioned both in the books and the show,<b> both</b> <b>dealing with the mistranslation about The Prince Who Was Promised</b>. Maester Aemon in <i>A Feast For Crows</i>&nbsp;(<b>Samwell IV</b>) says:</p><blockquote><p><i>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. <b>Dragons are neither male nor female,</b> Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy originally having been made using the word for <i>dragon</i> in High Valyrian, and dragons, by nature, have no fixed gender. (The lore giving various opinions of if dragons can continually change sex at will or not. The only real way to tell if a dragon is male or female is if it lays eggs or not).&nbsp;</p><p>And in the show (<b>Episode 7x02</b>) Missandei says:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>That noun has no gender in High Valyrian.</b> The proper translation for that prophecy would be, &lsquo;the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><b>So what we have here is not only confusion as to whether or not Azor Ahai reborn is supposed to be the same person as The Prince Who Was Promised, but also <i>gender confusion</i> about <b>The Prince Who Was Promised&nbsp;</b>because High Valyrian nouns are not gender specific.</b> On top of which, the show has only talked opening about The Prince Who Was Promised, but made no mention of Azor Ahai and him possibly being reborn <i>as</i> the prince who was promised or not.</p><p>Then of course, also from the books, <b>we have the knowledge that a song was composed for The Prince Who Was Promised</b>, which is called/known as&nbsp;&ldquo;the song of ice and fire&rdquo; which Daenerys learns of in her vision in the House of the Undying. (<i>ACOK</i>, <b>Daenerys IV</b>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>I&rsquo;m not the first person to suggest that The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai reborn are two different people</b> and that, between the mistranslations and gender confusion, the two things got mixed up together. But to make it clear, I&rsquo;d say <b>Azor Ahai is the one who will be reborn via salt and smoke who will wake dragons from stone</b>, and that <b>The Prince Who Was Promised is a separate prophecy, and person, and is the one who &ldquo;will bring the dawn.&rdquo;&nbsp;</b></p><p>So what does this have to do with The Others/White Walkers? Well, this is where more of that that <i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique Martin calls it comes in. In that what if The Prince Who Was Promised was actually promised <i>to</i> something - or someone. Namely, The Others/White Walkers. And what if it was a promise Azor Ahai <i>himself </i>made to them? It would go a ways to explain why the two are always connected to each other</p><p>If you look at the actual history of the First Long Night,&nbsp;<b>Azor Ahai never actually&nbsp;</b><i><b>defeated</b></i><b> The Others/White Walkers. He and the members of the first Night&rsquo;s Watch were able to drive them back, and had them flee into the Lands of Always Winter, but they were never defeated completely.</b> Which is why The Wall was built in the first place and The Night&rsquo;s Watch established - to guard <i>against</i> The Others/White Walkers coming back south and taking over the realms of Men as they did during the First Long Night.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be496d497142e862a19df7c6a121b16c/tumblr_inline_pobg04Kybu1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>So what if it was Azor Ahai himself who promised this&nbsp;&ldquo;prince&rdquo; to The Others/White Walker as a way to keep them from trying to invade the realms of Men another time?</b> Again, via both the 13th LC of the NW and Craster, we know making pacts/deals with The Others/White Walkers is possible in some way. <b>So, who is this&nbsp;&ldquo;prince who was promised&rdquo;? Yeah, I could just say Jon Snow, (because that&rsquo;s what it likely looks like I&rsquo;m about to say), but actually no, what if it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> him? Or, more specifically, what if it was <i>supposed</i> to be him but, once again, the prophecy got slightly misinterpted?</b></p><p>Put a pin in this. We&rsquo;ll come back to it. For now, let&rsquo;s go back to the 13th LC and Craster.</p><p>According to Old Nan, the 13th LC was a Stark, meaning he contained the blood of the First Men. <b>The blood of the First Men is thought to carry some magical properties, particularly within the Stark family bloodline, which contain warging and greenseer abilities.</b> And the Stark Kings of old were known as the Kings of Winter. So by the 13th LC likely sacrificing children of his blood that he made with his Night&rsquo;s Queen, he was providing The Others/White Walkers children that carried a strong magical element in their blood.</p><p><b>Throughout the story and the lore, the Stark are also associated with Ice. Even their Great Valyrian Sword is called simply&nbsp;&ldquo;Ice.&rdquo;&nbsp;</b><br /></p><p><b>With Craster</b>, <b>things are less certain there wrt the magical elements. </b>Wildlings, which his mother was said to be, are also of the Blood of the First men, but it is not clear if the magical element is a strong among the Wildings as it is with the Starks. <b>The main point, however, is that The Others/White Walkers accepted Craster&rsquo;s sons as offerings, just as they did from the Night&rsquo;s King/13th LC. So they were clearly deemed as acceptable in that regard.</b>&nbsp;Because, at the very least, they carried the blood of the First Men in them, from Craster&rsquo;s Wildling mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>[<b>Side Note:</b> <b>There is probably going to be a plot-hole in the show wrt Craster&rsquo;s kids - Gilly&rsquo;s baby Little Sam specifically. Because, in the books, there is a baby-switching plot going on with Gilly&rsquo;s baby</b>, (he isn&rsquo;t named Little Sam in the books, he&rsquo;s just referred to as&nbsp;<i>Monster</i> instead), <b>and Mance Rayder&rsquo;s baby son.</b> (Yes, Mance has a baby son in the books). Jon more or less forced Gilly to switch her son with Mance&rsquo;s baby son to try and protect Mance&rsquo;s son from possibly being killed/burned to death. So that is the fate that might actually befall Gilly&rsquo;s baby son in the books while Jon is still currently dead, leaving NONE of Craster&rsquo;s sons alive after that.]&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>So what we have here are two instances of sacrifices to The Others being made and accepted by the Others/White Walkers. And again, the only thing we&rsquo;ve seen The Others/White Walkers take as a sacrifice are babies.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s go back and look at The Prince Who Was Promised and, more specifically, the thing Rhaegar says about the song composed for him, specifically called&nbsp;&ldquo;The Song of Ice and Fire.&rdquo; As we all know, that is the actual title of Martin&rsquo;s book series that the tv show <i>Game of Thrones</i> is based on. And, of course, <b>Jon being the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark have many thinking he is &ldquo;The Prince Who Was Promised&rdquo; and the&nbsp;&ldquo;song of ice and fire&rdquo; because of his blood combination.</b> <b>However, there is another thing in the lore with the title Ice and Fire in it that is being overlooked here </b>that I think is very significant, particularly wrt The Others/White Walkers.</p><p>And that is,<b>&nbsp;<i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i></b>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> was a pact forged between House Stark and House Targaryen, (more specifically the black faction of House Targaryen during the Dance of Dragons). <b>As it is described in <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i>, it was an agreement between the two houses that a Stark male would wed a Targaryen Princess.</b> (The recent book<i> Fire and Blood</i> gives more of an account and specifics of <i>who </i>the Princess would be &hellip; or, at least, who her <i>father</i> was supposed to be). The pact, however, was never fulfilled after The Dance ended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What is the significant part of this is what House Stark was specifically asking for, which was a Targaryen <i>princess</i>. Cregan Stark specifically wanted a young Targaryen&nbsp;<i>girl</i> to wed into the Stark family.&nbsp;</p><p>As explained above, via both the books/lore and the show, <b>the Starks have a connection to the happenings with The Others/White Walkers.</b>&nbsp;We have the story of the 13 Lord Commander/Night&rsquo;s King. We know about Bran the Builder who, with the help of the Children of the Forest (and giants) helped raise the wall to guard against them invading again.<b> I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a stretch to believe that the Kings of Winter of ages past, as the Stark Kings were first called, not only <i>knew</i> about &ldquo;The Prince Who Was Promised,&rdquo; but likely also what the true meaning of what this prince/princess&nbsp;<i>being</i> promised was all about.</b> That whomever this prince/princess was, when born, they would be given to the The Others, who had been promised to them by&nbsp;Azor Ahai.&nbsp;</p><p>So what might this have to do with the <i>Pact of Ice and Fire</i> and requesting a Targaryen princess to marry into House Stark? I think a clue comes from Book 2, <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, and Daenerys&rsquo; encounter with The Undying in the House of the Undying.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f51c4054946c4c1a6b8cd02f3f7bd89c/tumblr_inline_pobikwIDyK1qi5869_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In ACOK, the Undying Ones are described in a way that has them seeming to be a representation of The Others/White Walkers; with them being described as&nbsp;&ldquo;blue and cold.&rdquo; And then there is this passage, where they try to consume Daenerys (<b>Daenerys IV, ACOK</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>They wanted her, needed her<b>, the fire, the life, </b>and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them &hellip;</i></p><p><i>But then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the <b>indigo air</b>, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany&rsquo;s gasp turned to horror. <b>The Undying were all around her,</b> <b>blue and cold</b>, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their <b>dry cold hands</b>, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. <b>Even her heart had ceased to beat.</b> She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting &hellip;</i></p><p><i><b><i>Then indigo</i></b><i> turned to <b>orange</b>, and whispers turned to screams. <b>Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone</b>, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. <b>Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and</b> <b>tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons</b>, and when his head snapped forward, <b>fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot</b>. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. &ldquo;</i><br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Here we have the Undying, who are described in terms of cold and death, linking them in many way to The Others/White Walkers, trying to consume the fire - which is linked to life - of Daenerys. (And they almost succeeded until Drogon saves her).&nbsp;</p><p><b>There is indication that The Undying have been waiting for Daenerys for thousands of years before this moment.</b> <b>They want the lifeforce, <i>the fire</i> that she has, when she finally comes. </b>So what we have here are creatures associated with imagery of - and visually linked to - creatures of death, (The Others/White Walkers), trying to to consume a life,<b><i> the fire</i></b>, from someone of Valyrian descent. <b>Valyrian blood constantly linked to that of fire, and fire, throughout&nbsp;the series, is linked to life.</b> House Targaryen&rsquo;s own words (a house motto they chose when Aegon the Conqueror first began his conquest and wanted his family to adopt more Westerosi culture BTW - they never had a House motto before that) is <i>Fire and Blood</i>, two images also associated with life.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Just like The Undying, The Others/White Walkers also appear to be seeking life of some kind.</b> The taking of babies, and then using those babies to create more of their kind by turning them into Others/White Walkers I think ties into this. However, they very well might be something missing from what they seek out of this. A life-force that contains what The Undying were trying to <i>take</i> from Daenerys - <i>a fire</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>How is a new life <i>usually</i> created? Male and Female coming together. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nIbFw-brBvw?t=70\"><i>Melisandre alludes to the power of that ability - to create life - in the scene when she tries to seduce Jon in Season 5</i></a> (<b>Episode 5x04</b>) (Start at: 1:10)&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>And then of course, there is the quote from the book that she says in this seduction scene (which wasn&rsquo;t a seduction scene in the book btw), from <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> (<b>Jon VI</b>):&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>The Lord of Light in his wisdom made us male and female, two parts of a greater whole.

Power to cast shadows.</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the show was being a bit more hard-hitting in the foreshadowing than the book by having Melisandre say these words while appearing to try and <i>seduce</i> Jon. <b>That there is power in the ability - in the <i>act</i> - of men and women coming together and creating life. </b>Unlike The Others/White Walkers, who can only create more of themselves by taking an already living creation - in this case, a child - and turning them into a being like them, a being of the cold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, even with the power of men and women to do this, The Undying specifically were waiting for and sought out <i>Daenerys</i> for that life, <i>that fire</i>, that they needed. <b>And that may be because, while both male and female coming together can create life and light, it is the <i>female</i> who brings forth that light and life&nbsp;<i>into</i> the world via childbirth.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>There is a running theme of motherhood, and what that means, throughout&nbsp;Daenerys&rsquo; story. She is called Mhysa by the people she liberated from slavery and metaphorically&nbsp;giving&nbsp;them new life as free&nbsp;people. She birthed creatures that are considered to be fire made flesh via</b><i> <b>fire itself</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>I think <i>this</i> is why <i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> called for a Targaryen <i>princess</i> to wed into House Stark. <b>That the need for a joining of Ice and Fire had to specially be that the fruits of that joining, the life created from it, be <i>born</i> of fire; </b>born via a daughter - a female - who carried such fire within her, which those of Valyrian descent do.&nbsp;</p><p>And this is where Rhaegar Targaryen made one of his many mistakes when it comes to the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. At some point I do think Rhaegar thought he needed a child who was - bloodline-wise - of&nbsp;&ldquo;ice and fire.&rdquo; <b>Rhaegar had already changed his life twice-over trying to fulfill the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. There is no reason to assume he wouldn&rsquo;t have done it again if he came into more info about it. </b>For all he did likley love Lyanna, I think it&rsquo;s probable that he also saw their child as the one who would make this prophecy he&rsquo;d been chasing most of his life come true &hellip; after first thinking it was about himself, and then thinking it would be about his three children he would (hopefully) have, and the idea that &ldquo;the dragon has three heads.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>However, again, Rhaegar was incorrect, not just about what the whole idea of The Prince That Was Promised actually meant, but how the blood combination of Ice and Fire was supposed to be &hellip; or, more specifically, how the child had to be born. <b>Because Lyanna wasn&rsquo;t fire, or the blood of fire. She was of </b><i><b>ice</b>, </i><b>with the blood of the First Men within her, not the blood of Old Valyria. And the Prince Who Was Promised more than likely&nbsp;had to be born of <i>fire</i>, via a female </b><i><b>with the blood of fire</b>.</i></p><p>From <i>A Game of Thrones</i> (<b>Daenerys X</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she wanted to shout to him, no my good knight, do not fear for me. <b>The fire is mine.</b> I am Daenerys Stormborn, <b>daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons</b>, don&rsquo;t you see? Don&rsquo;t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Blood of the Dragon</i> are what those of blood of Old Valyria are called. Dragons are fire made flesh. Those of the blood Old Valyria, the Targaryens, like dragons, are also likely fire made flesh. And <i>fire</i> is life and light.&nbsp;</p><p><b>And the coming together of <i>that </i>fire with ice is symbolic of <i>balance.</i></b>&nbsp;From <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (<b>Daenerys IV</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I have come for the gift of truth,&rdquo; Dany said. &ldquo;In the long hall, the things I saw &hellip; were they true visions, or lies? Past things, or things to come? What did they mean?&rdquo;\n&hellip; the shape of shadows &hellip; morrows not yet made &hellip; <b>drink from the cup of ice</b> &hellip; <b>drink from the cup of fire</b> &hellip;\n&hellip; mother of dragons &hellip; child of three &hellip;</i></p></blockquote><p>And from <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Bran II</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Because they&rsquo;re different,&rdquo;</b> he insisted. &ldquo;Like night and day, <b>or ice and fire.</b>\"&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><b>\"If ice can burn,&rdquo;</b> said Jojen in his solemn voice, <b>&ldquo;then love and hate can mate &hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</b></i></p></blockquote><p><b>* * *</b><br /></p><p><b>A great video that talks about the idea of balance</b> between ice (Jon) and fire (Dany) <b>and visual&nbsp;symbols&nbsp;the show uses to convey this </b>connection to each other, along with The Others/White Walkers/Night King.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p><b>* * *</b></p><p><b>In the show, The Night King is likely a visual representation of a being known as The Great Other from the books/lore. </b>(Since, again, The Night King doesn&rsquo;t exist&nbsp;in the books).<b> The Great Other is said to be the god of cold, darkness and death,</b> and he has no physical appearance, likely being a more metaphysical entity given the little we know.<b> He is considered to be the enemy of the Lord of Light, known as R'hllor.</b> In the show, killing the Night King will likely be the equivalent of defeating The Great Other in the books.</p><p>The actor who plays the Night King <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/03/07/night-king-game-of-thrones-interview/\">gave a recent interview</a> which seems to support the idea that part of his character is likely based on The Great Other from the books:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What does the Night King want, anyway?</b></i></p><p><i>Somebody made him the Night King. Nobody knows who he was before &mdash; a soldier or part of [nobility]. He never wanted to be the Night King. I think he wants revenge. Everybody in this story has two sides &mdash; a bad side and a good side. The Night King only has one side, a bad side.</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>Thinking the Night King wants revenge isn&rsquo;t the same as that being what he definitely wants. <b>However, the idea that the Night King only has a bad side seems to fit with the view of what The Great Other is and represents in the books/lore, which is the god of darkness and death. </b>However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s all that cut and dry even via what The Great Other/Night King is. Because evil acts can be committed by those who fight for the light, such as good acts can likely be committed by those who fight for darkness/death. Melisandre&rsquo;s burning of Shireen Baratheon, which Martin has already confirmed will happen in the books as well, is proof enough of that. &nbsp;</p><p>Also, from the recent interview, there is this:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What can we expect from him in the final season?</b></i></p><p><i>People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There&rsquo;s also that moment [in &ldquo;Hardhome&rdquo;] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms &mdash; there&rsquo;s a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time.</i> &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><b>I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that that target <i>isn&rsquo;t </i>Jon Snow. He had more than one opportunity to kill Jon, but proceeded instead to mostly just taunt him.</b> I don&rsquo;t think the target is Daenerys either, or he could have easily killed Drogon and gotten her when she came beyond the wall in Episode 6 of Season 7.</p><p>The Three-eyed Raven/Crow being the target - with that now being Bran, is an option I admit, however &hellip; the original Three-Eyed Raven/Crow, who was Brynden Rivers aka Bloodraven, had been the Three-Eyed Raven/Crow for many years, and there is little to no indication that The Night King was actively trying to kill him during any of that time.</p><p><b>However, what if the killing of the target doesn&rsquo;t mean just &ldquo;to kill,&rdquo; so much in the sense of what we saw happen to the former Three-Eyed Raven in the show,</b> <b>but is more in the vein of what happened to Daenerys in the House of the Undying in the books, when the Undying tried to take her life-force from her.</b></p><p>And the person they want to do this with is actually the <i>child</i> Daenerys and Jon will/have created?</p><p><b>Because the foreshadowing that Jon and Daenerys will have a child in the coming season was pretty obvious, not to mention Daenerys whole underlying story theme and motif of motherhood. </b>Also, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CczKaabSRfU?t=76\">do not overlook this clip, which HBO chose to highlight before the start of Season 8,</a> where Viserys makes this comment about the child that Dany is set to have with Khal Drogo (<b>Episode 1x06</b>) (Start: 1:16):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><blockquote><p><i>He won&rsquo;t be a real Targaryen. He won&rsquo;t be a true dragon.</i></p></blockquote><p><b>Jon and Daenerys&rsquo; child however, who <i>will</i> be a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Targaryen via both its parents, as well as a child that will also carry the blood of the First Men, the <i>ice</i>, via his/her father,</b> might very well be the actual target, given what we&rsquo;ve already seen of The Others/White Walkers taking of babies who were sacrificed to them. &ldquo;<b>The Prince Who Was Promised will bring the dawn&rdquo; might not mean that the Prince Who Was Promised will somehow fight and defeat The Others/White Walkers, but that in sacrificing&nbsp;this prince/princess who was &ldquo;promised&rdquo; to the them, <b>promised&nbsp;</b>to The Others/White Walkers, promised to them by Azor Ahai all those thousands of years ago, that</b><i> <b>tha</b>t </i><b>will cause The Others/White Walkers to once again leave the realms of men alone,</b> retreat back into the Lands of Always Winter, and bring back the Dawn for another 8000 years or so. <b>Until the cycle will likely start again.</b></p><p><b>And this would, quite frankly, be where much internal conflict and drama would arise.</b> Because neither Jon nor Daenerys &nbsp;would be up for sacrificing their baby, even for some greater good, in the view of either Craster or the 13th Lord Commander. (In fact, I think Jon&rsquo;s going to learn a hard lesson about that when the baby switching plot he instigated wrt Gilly&rsquo;s baby in the books plays out to a tragic end for Gilly&rsquo;s baby). <b>If they can find a way to defeat The Others/White Walkers without having to make such a sacrifice and basically taking the easy way out to do so, they may also guarantee that this time, The Others/White Walkers will truly be destroyed and gone forever this time.</b> Instead of what Azor Ahai did, which only seemed to have the go into some kind of slumber and dormancy, and staying in the lands beyond the wall.</p><p><b>However, there may be some among Jon and Daenerys&rsquo; army and/or advisors who would want to take the easy route and give the child over to end the conflict quickly</b>, which - while pushing off the problem again for another couple of thousands years - could prevent many people from dying and becoming a part of the Army of the Dead and overrunning Westeros as was what happened during the first Long Night. (Which didn&rsquo;t stay limited to only Westeros, but spread over almost all of Essos as well).</p><p>In the show, Daenerys&rsquo; story has a theme about wanting to&nbsp;&ldquo;break the wheel&rdquo;; the wheel being the nature of the political dynamics of Westeros that benefits the more Noble Classes that fight for power and dominance, symbolized by the Iron Throne, and those who do not benefit from that ongoing struggle, which are the lower classes and smallfolk of Westeros. They are the ones who are always crushed underneath this wheel, this circular nature of the political power fights and wars.&nbsp;</p><p><b>However, this idea of&nbsp;&ldquo;breaking the wheel&rdquo; may also, in the end, extend to the fight against The Others/White Walkers.</b> As noted, this is not the first time they have invaded the realms of men. And, the last time they did, they were not defeated. The problem they are, the threat they pose, seems to have been pushed off to another generation to have to fight, combat and deal with. And at the center of that fight to do so might just rest with Ice and Fire coming together to create something new. <b>However, the prophecy that has dictated the lives of many people that has lead to this, has never dictated the lives of the two people who may have the most influence in The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy coming to fruition. </b>Neither Jon or Daenerys have lived their lives or made decisions in their lives sorley to fulfil a prophecy. <b>And given what was very likely the <i>weasel-wording</i> technique used for The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy, the fact that they did so may, in the end, be the deciding factor in the breaking of <i>another</i> wheel, another cycle of destruction.</b>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7a30aee294fcf2ca367f6036e2f18/tumblr_inline_podb5g0cdu1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",

The Youtube channel Talking Thrones <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA\">posted a video</a> that talks in a few of the same directions I write about here; and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1UHGTGlDDT-LfHGij5Xggg\">@oadara</a> and I discussed a lot of this between us over DM, so much of this comes out of that as well.</p>\n<p>So there are two main prophecies most people focus on when it comes to ASOIAF/GOT, which are:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>- The prophecy that Maggy the Frog</b> gave to Cersei when she was a girl.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>- The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai prophecy</b> that talks of a coming hero who will save the world from the coming darkness.</p>\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at <b>what George R. R. Martin himself says about prophecies</b>, particularly in fantasy fiction:</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it&rsquo;s tricky,&rdquo; Martin noted. &ldquo;You want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way. You want to be unpredictable about it. Shakespeare is the ultimate example of that&mdash;when the forest of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Castle, MacBeth will fall. Everybody laughs&mdash;how can the forest come to the castle. [Malcolm] came camouflaged with branches and so on. Also, during the War of the Roses, one of the lords was prophesized that he would die at a certain castle. So he always took pains to avoid that castle. But then in the first The Battle of St Albans, he was wounded and died outside a pub that had that castle on its pub sign. <b>You have to look at prophecies carefully and look at the weasel-wording.</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n<p>(George R. R. Martin, <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2015/04/12/game-thrones-cersei-flashback/?asdf=&amp;hootPostID=7dbf8334a2e354db75463cc29a0cb5ca\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, 04/12/2015)</p>\n<p>Martin is specifically talking about two types of prophecies here in the examples he gives: the <i><b>self-fulfilling prophecy</b></i> and the <i><b>non-literal prophecy</b></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

Mainly because it fits this idea that I already had planned for future use hehehe. But thank you so much mama, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUHtk2uATgDxM6Ewo_QiyKA\">@adecila</a> for suggesting this, for making me start on actually developing this plot bunny hehe! I hope you like it! This little fic of mild angst with a lovely ending ^3^</p><p>PS: this plot will come up sometime in the future yes.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>For so long those three words had hovered at the back of his throat. He never dared say them aloud, not even to himself, so afraid that uttering them would tarnish its beauty. It meant more if they were kept inside, tucked away in a space within his heart. That way, he could feel the emotions those words carry much more acutely if they lived right by his now thundering organ within his chest. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear anything over the roar of blood rushing to his head as he froze, watching his best friend\u2019s eyes as they grew infinitesimally wider and wider. He watched as a slender pale hand rose to touch her plump lips, fingers gingerly tracing the imprint left from his own.\u00a0</p><p>He could always read her. Dany\u2019s eyes told him everything he needs to know about her. How she felt, what she was thinking, what she wanted to do. But now? He couldn\u2019t see pass the impassive shroud over the windows of her soul.</p><p>Those three little words had the power to cause irreversible damage, he knew that too. The only good thing remaining since the news of her engagement broke out was her promise to him that they would always be the best of friends. Had he squandered everything they had? Was he about to lose the only link he had with the love of his life? A sharp jolt of panic shot through his chest.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>So ashamed of how he felt, so embarrassed by his unfortunate boldness, Jon ducked his head. His chin digging into his chest as his unruly bangs fell forwards over his eyes. A blessing it was for he couldn\u2019t face the woman who held his heart from the very moment he had met her as that little girl with her pile of books, under her lemon tree. This woman with a heart that was not his to covert. It would never be his now.</p><p>The soft touch of her fingers to his cheeks had his flinching. He wished that she would just tell him that she was sorry and that she was already in love with someone else. He didn\u2019t need her to pity him. Scrunching his eyes shut, he curled his fingers inwards. The sting from his nails forced him to stay still, to not let the burn in his heart and the tears in his eyes to slip out.</p><p>To his utter astonishment, Dany stepped closer to him, right up to him until their fronts were pressed seamlessly together. Ensconced between the tree behind his back and the solid weight of the woman in front of him with her arms around him, he had no place to escape to. His traitorous heart pounded away within his chest, longing so badly to reach for hers. She was so close now that he couldn\u2019t evade her gaze anymore. Slowly, he brought his gaze up to meet hers.

Another jolt of surprise zinged through him, he could practicality feel her lips morph into a smile. She seemed glad that he was kissing her back.\u00a0</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know what was happening but boy did he kiss her back. He could no longer hold back his desire for this woman in his arms.

Both of them were more occupied with new friendships and for her, her studies and for him, his family\u2019s farm.

Another jolt of surprise zinged through him, he could practicality feel her lips morph into a smile. She seemed glad that he was kissing her back.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon didn&rsquo;t know what was happening but boy did he kiss her back. He could no longer hold back his desire for this woman in his arms. She knew how he felt and yet she hadn&rsquo;t fled for the hills! Those fingers clenched so hard to his sides loosened and before he knew it, one of his hands had meandered up her side and into her wavy silver curls while the other was pressed to the small of her back, pushing her closer to him.</p><p>Tilting his head for a better angle, he flicked his tongue across her bottom lip. A silent request for her to grant him entrance. A request to taste her for the very first time. A request she granted with a quiet sigh. Like a man parched, he dove in. He took his time to savour her, every happy moan of hers was a song to his ears and a melody for his heart to dance to. </p><p>What Jon was oblivious to when it came to Dany was that she felt the same way for him. Have since the age of fourteen when Jon&rsquo;s body started filling out his brother&rsquo;s hand me downs and his voice started to deepen. The weird flush to her cheeks and the staccato beating of her heart told her that he was different to when they were little, something had changed. Chalking it up to teenage hormones, her rational mind forced her to push all those feelings away, in time they would pass and she would be back to tumbling with her best friend down the grassy hill behind her house again. </p><p>Unfortunately, the days of rough play and rolling around never came back. Both of them were more occupied with new friendships and for her, her studies and for him, his family&rsquo;s farm. They drifted apart when she went to college in the big city but she always, always kept her weekends free for him. She drove back home to visit, she wrote letters and called him whenever she could and he did the same.</p><p>That strange feeling she felt when he was near never lessened with time. So much so, that she had learned to live with it. She associated them with her Jon. Her best friend, her confidant, the boy and the man who always came to her. With a simple &ldquo;I need you&rdquo; spoken over the phone, he would be there as soon as he could to hold her, to lend her a shoulder or a listening ear. </p><p>She never knew how to define the strange sensation that came over when she was in his presence. Not until she found herself in a relationship with a co-worker from work. Sure, he was sweet and nice enough but every time they held hands or swapped kisses, there was never a spark or a flutter in her belly.&nbsp;</p><p>Something was missing.&nbsp;</p><p>In the nights when Jim was asleep and there was nothing to occupy her mind, her thoughts would always drift to her Jon and those strange sensations he aroused in her when they were together. She missed him so much. When she started working, he hardly ever came to visit anymore what with the family farm now his to run entirely after his father&rsquo;s death. It was on one of those nights that she had an epiphany. What if the thing missing in her relationship with Jim wasn&rsquo;t missing, she just had the wrong man!</p><p>But by then, Jim had already asked for her hand. Jim was a safer choice and she could tell how hard he was working at loving her, so she stayed. Maybe she could learn to love him back. She couldn&rsquo;t ditch her future in the department for a slight chance that an old friend might love her back. What if Jon was already happily married to someone back home?</p><p>Oh how silly she was! Who knew all it would take was her coming back to the place she grew up for a visit to her family and break the news of her engagement for the tides to turn?</p><p>Both of them yearned for their kisses to last but sadly, they were only mortals who required oxygen to live. Pulling back from him, she smiled an indulgent smile at his adorable glassy eyed expression. Now, in her Jon&rsquo;s arms, she never felt happier as her heart thudded away and her cheeks were no doubt a rosy pink. She knew now that this was where she truly belonged. </p><p>Brushing a curl away from his face, still enclosed in his loose embrace, all she said to him was, &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>",
