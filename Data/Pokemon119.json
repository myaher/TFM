Sure, there was an attack that could dish out 100 for 3 Energy, but it couldn\u2019t be used 2 turns in a row. Why bother with that? Well, Virizion was a Grass-type, and while that wasn\u2019t the most common Weakness out there, there was one very specific Pokemon that was very common in the HGSS-On format and had a strategy revolving around tanking hits and dishing them out better than an opponent could. Maybe being able to smash through a dangerous Pokemon like that in one hit was enough to consider Virizion after all.</p><p>100 HP was really nice for a Basic Pokemon. To be fair, there were plenty that hit higher totals with all of the other legends in the Black &amp; White era, but it was a high enough number to take a hit from the likes of Terrakion, which was really what you were using this for. The Fire Weakness didn\u2019t mean much. Reshiram might have been able to save on Energy discards if weakened a bit and Ho-Oh EX had an easier time but that was about it. The -20 Water Resistance helped out against Vanilluxe, Empoleon, and even Keldeo EX if you were using this in later formats. Needing only an Energy to retreat was good for a Pokemon that needed to switch out rather often.</p><p>Giga Drain wasn\u2019t too good. 30 damage for 2 Energy wasn\u2019t going to cut it even if Virizion was healed by the same amount of damage done to the Defending Pokemon. It was simply too weak.</p><p>Sacred Sword was powerful but came with a catch. It was hard to ignore an attack that could do 100 for 2 Grass and a Colorless Energy. That was impressive. The problem was that Sacred Sword couldn\u2019t be used during your next turn, so Virizion couldn\u2019t be a main attacker. It found its role by being an occasional backup in CMT decks, using Celebi Prime to get Grass Energy. Virizion wasn\u2019t used all that often even in that deck, since its job was to screw over Terrakion decks and CMT was still solid against those, but if you expected a lot of Terrakion where you were, Virizion could be a very nice choice.</p><p>Virizion had a very small spot in the game. Being a backup attacker for a good deck was a nice spot, at least. It was best in the HGSS-On format, and the more popular Lightning- and Darkness-types were in an area the better Virizion would be. Lightning- and Darkness-types tended to be followed by a surge in Terrakion decks that Virizion feasted on. If those weren\u2019t popular, Virizion was left on the sidelines. It was an interesting situation and guessing right about what decks would be most popular was key to using this card well.<br/></p>",

Sure, there was an attack that could dish out 100 for 3 Energy, but it couldn\u2019t be used 2 turns in a row. Why bother with that? Well, Virizion was a Grass-type, and while that wasn\u2019t the most common Weakness out there, there was one very specific Pokemon that was very common in the HGSS-On format and had a strategy revolving around tanking hits and dishing them out better than an opponent could. Maybe being able to smash through a dangerous Pokemon like that in one hit was enough to consider Virizion after all.</p><p>100 HP was really nice for a Basic Pokemon. To be fair, there were plenty that hit higher totals with all of the other legends in the Black &amp; White era, but it was a high enough number to take a hit from the likes of Terrakion, which was really what you were using this for. The Fire Weakness didn\u2019t mean much. Reshiram might have been able to save on Energy discards if weakened a bit and Ho-Oh EX had an easier time but that was about it. The -20 Water Resistance helped out against Vanilluxe, Empoleon, and even Keldeo EX if you were using this in later formats. Needing only an Energy to retreat was good for a Pokemon that needed to switch out rather often.</p><p>Giga Drain wasn\u2019t too good. 30 damage for 2 Energy wasn\u2019t going to cut it even if Virizion was healed by the same amount of damage done to the Defending Pokemon. It was simply too weak.</p><p>Sacred Sword was powerful but came with a catch. It was hard to ignore an attack that could do 100 for 2 Grass and a Colorless Energy. That was impressive. The problem was that Sacred Sword couldn\u2019t be used during your next turn, so Virizion couldn\u2019t be a main attacker. It found its role by being an occasional backup in CMT decks, using Celebi Prime to get Grass Energy. Virizion wasn\u2019t used all that often even in that deck, since its job was to screw over Terrakion decks and CMT was still solid against those, but if you expected a lot of Terrakion where you were, Virizion could be a very nice choice.</p><p>Virizion had a very small spot in the game. Being a backup attacker for a good deck was a nice spot, at least. It was best in the HGSS-On format, and the more popular Lightning- and Darkness-types were in an area the better Virizion would be. Lightning- and Darkness-types tended to be followed by a surge in Terrakion decks that Virizion feasted on. If those weren\u2019t popular, Virizion was left on the sidelines. It was an interesting situation and guessing right about what decks would be most popular was key to using this card well.<br></p></p>",
