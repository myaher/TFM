She becomes close with some of the most powerful houses of Westeros like the Lannisters and the Tyrells. Later she is taken to the Vale by Littlefinger who will personally educate her on the game of politics. Sansa is learning on how to be a political player using diplomacy and dialogue, avoinding this way more wars and conflicts. There are several foreshadows of Sansa as Queen in the books</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, <b>\u201cwill marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.\u201d</b> Arya screwed up her face. <b>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Sansa.&rdquo;</b></p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>Arya, AGoT</p><p><br/></p><p>&gt;&ldquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen an aurochs,&rsquo; Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table.

Her muscles burned and every breath felt like a battle. Her heart hammered against her ribs and she swallowed a few times to prevent herself from getting rid of her late lunch. </p><p>When Jon fought it looked so easy. It almost seemed as if he was dancing instead of fighting. It was beautiful and gracious. It was a form of art. </p><p>She knew it was unfair to compare herself to him. After all, he had been fighting his entire life and she had just started her first lessons, but still. She felt clumsy and stupid. Her muscles were too weak to balance the sword properly and therefore she constantly lost her balance. She needed all her concentration to not accidentally hurt herself, while she actually had to focus on her opponent instead.</p><p>It was nice of him to say that she was getting better, but he was obviously just trying to keep her motivated. And it was not really working.</p><p>\u201cYou just say that because you love me.\u201d Sansa rolled her eyes. \u201cI still feel like a stupid damsel in distress who needs a man to fight her battles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just started your training. It\u2019s not something you can miraculously learn overnight.\u201d Jon grinned. \u201cI&rsquo;ve been holding a sword since birth. Robb got one even before he was born. You never got one from your father.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI could have asked for one.\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cArya did. She can defend herself in battle, while I\u2019m defenseless against anyone who wants to harm me.\u201d </p><p>Jon placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and shook her. \u201cCan you please just stop that?\u201d He looked straight into her eyes and Sansa felt a shiver rolling down her spine. \u201cYou&rsquo;re not defenseless in battle. You\u2019re not a bad fighter. And you\u2019re not a damsel in distress.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYes, Arya knows how to use a sword and you don\u2019t, but without you I\u2019d be dead by now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Sansa raised her eyebrows. \u201cI asked Littlefinger for help where you didn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s literally all I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was the difference between winning and losing.\u201d Jon pressed the palm of his hand to her cheek. His hand sweated a little, but it was comforting and warm and Sansa closed her eyes to enjoy his touch for a short moment. \u201cYou knew Ramsay and the tricks he played and you tried to warn me. And I didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWhat are you suggesting now? That I\u2019m intelligent and smart? That I know how to read people? And how is that gonna help me when some brute with a sword comes for me?\u201d</p><p>Jon curled his lips up into a smile. \u201cFighting is not just about brute force.\u201d Jon stepped back again and reached for his sword. \u201cIf it was just about brute force, I\u2019d be dead by now too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled back at him. \u201cAre you now joking about your own height?\u201d</p><p>When he had left Winterfell to go to the wall, she had had to look up at him. Now she was a few inches taller, even on her bare feet. </p><p>So much had changed ever since then, when the world had still been beautiful and innocent and safe, but luckily not everything had changed for the worst. </p><p>Because at that time, she had never thought that Jon Snow would turn out to be exactly the prince charming her father had promised her. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m telling you that your intelligence will give you an advantage in battle.\u201d Jon nodded and Sansa kneeled down to get her sword again. </p><p>The cold iron became heavier and heavier with each second that passed, mostly because her muscles grew more and more tired. But she bit her lip and gathered all her courage and strength to focus one more time.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t lean on your force or power.\u201d Jon started moving his sword, almost too fast for her eyes to register. \u201cYou don\u2019t need force or power to wound him.\u201d He slowed down a little and with her tongue between her slightly parted lips Sansa tried to block all his attempts at cutting her. \u201cYou just have to make it through his defenses.\u201d He narrowed his eyes and slowly he started to go faster and faster again. \u201cRead me. Read my body language, my arms, my legs.\u201d He gave Sansa the time to let her glance wander over him before he moved his sword again. \u201cDon&rsquo;t look at the sword, but at me. I\u2019ve gotta prepare my movements. If you catch me preparing, you can block me and surprise me.\u201d</p><p>Sansa blocked a few more swings and concentrated on his muscles. She saw his arm tense, she saw how he shifted his weight from one foot to the other and after a while she started to recognize the patterns. And even though she could barely hold her sword anymore, she blocked him faster now, earlier. </p><p>His sword didn\u2019t come as close to her head anymore, to her skin, to her arms, to her legs. He could move faster and faster and still she could block him.</p><p>\u201cAnd now the next step.\u201d Jon whispered, slightly out of breath. He had never been out of breath during a sword fight training with her before. \u201cSurprise me and break through my defenses.\u201d He nodded at her and Sansa gathered all her willpower and concentrated even more.</p><p>She blocked his swings and combined the patterns in her head. Left, right, left, left, right, fight, low, high, left, right. She smiled when she realized she knew what his next move was gonna be and before he could start his movement she circled around him, seeing that he was balancing on his wrong foot to catch her in time. </p><p>The next second she held the tip of her sword to his throat. \u201cAnd dead.\u201d She screamed and she dropped her sword on the ground at her feet. \u201cI did it!\u201d She fell down in the sand, her muscles and body too tired to carry her any longer. \u201cI beat you!\u201d</p><p>Jon placed his sword next to him and then he kneeled down in front of her. His hand grabbed her chin and with a proud smile he locked his glance with hers. \u201cSee?\u201d He spoke softly and moved a little closer towards her. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not about being strong. It\u2019s about being smarter than your opponent. You can do and be that. You are that. You\u2019re smarter than almost everyone you will encounter, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Sansa nodded and she closed her eyes while she leaned in. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready yet to go to war with you.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cI&rsquo;m already exhausted after beating one opponent. Let alone ten. Or hundred.\u201d</p><p>Jon wrapped his arms around her and she felt a soft kiss on her forehead. \u201cThat&rsquo;s something we can work on.\u201d He tightened his grip. \u201cYou&rsquo;re gonna be the nightmare of every soldier, Sansa Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe.\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cWe&rsquo;re gonna be the nightmare of everyone who dares to cross us.&ldquo;</p>",

She can defend herself in battle, while I\u2019m defenseless against anyone who wants to harm me.\u201d </p><p>Jon placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and shook her. \u201cCan you please just stop that?\u201d He looked straight into her eyes and Sansa felt a shiver rolling down her spine. \u201cYou\u2019re not defenseless in battle. You\u2019re not a bad fighter. And you\u2019re not a damsel in distress.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYes, Arya knows how to use a sword and you don\u2019t, but without you I\u2019d be dead by now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Sansa raised her eyebrows. \u201cI asked Littlefinger for help where you didn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s literally all I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was the difference between winning and losing.\u201d Jon pressed the palm of his hand to her cheek. His hand sweated a little, but it was comforting and warm and Sansa closed her eyes to enjoy his touch for a short moment. \u201cYou knew Ramsay and the tricks he played and you tried to warn me. And I didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWhat are you suggesting now? That I\u2019m intelligent and smart? That I know how to read people? And how is that gonna help me when some brute with a sword comes for me?\u201d</p><p>Jon curled his lips up into a smile. \u201cFighting is not just about brute force.\u201d Jon stepped back again and reached for his sword. \u201cIf it was just about brute force, I\u2019d be dead by now too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled back at him. \u201cAre you now joking about your own height?\u201d</p><p>When he had left Winterfell to go to the wall, she had had to look up at him. Now she was a few inches taller, even on her bare feet. </p><p>So much had changed ever since then, when the world had still been beautiful and innocent and safe, but luckily not everything had changed for the worst. </p><p>Because at that time, she had never thought that Jon Snow would turn out to be exactly the prince charming her father had promised her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you that your intelligence will give you an advantage in battle.\u201d Jon nodded and Sansa kneeled down to get her sword again. </p><p>The cold iron became heavier and heavier with each second that passed, mostly because her muscles grew more and more tired. But she bit her lip and gathered all her courage and strength to focus one more time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lean on your force or power.\u201d Jon started moving his sword, almost too fast for her eyes to register. \u201cYou don\u2019t need force or power to wound him.\u201d He slowed down a little and with her tongue between her slightly parted lips Sansa tried to block all his attempts at cutting her. \u201cYou just have to make it through his defenses.\u201d He narrowed his eyes and slowly he started to go faster and faster again. \u201cRead me. Read my body language, my arms, my legs.\u201d He gave Sansa the time to let her glance wander over him before he moved his sword again. \u201cDon\u2019t look at the sword, but at me. I\u2019ve gotta prepare my movements. If you catch me preparing, you can block me and surprise me.\u201d</p><p>Sansa blocked a few more swings and concentrated on his muscles. She saw his arm tense, she saw how he shifted his weight from one foot to the other and after a while she started to recognize the patterns. And even though she could barely hold her sword anymore, she blocked him faster now, earlier. </p><p>His sword didn\u2019t come as close to her head anymore, to her skin, to her arms, to her legs. He could move faster and faster and still she could block him.</p><p>\u201cAnd now the next step.\u201d Jon whispered, slightly out of breath. He had never been out of breath during a sword fight training with her before. \u201cSurprise me and break through my defenses.\u201d He nodded at her and Sansa gathered all her willpower and concentrated even more.</p><p>She blocked his swings and combined the patterns in her head. Left, right, left, left, right, fight, low, high, left, right. She smiled when she realized she knew what his next move was gonna be and before he could start his movement she circled around him, seeing that he was balancing on his wrong foot to catch her in time. </p><p>The next second she held the tip of her sword to his throat. \u201cAnd dead.\u201d She screamed and she dropped her sword on the ground at her feet. \u201cI did it!\u201d She fell down in the sand, her muscles and body too tired to carry her any longer. \u201cI beat you!\u201d</p><p>Jon placed his sword next to him and then he kneeled down in front of her. His hand grabbed her chin and with a proud smile he locked his glance with hers. \u201cSee?\u201d He spoke softly and moved a little closer towards her. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being strong. It\u2019s about being smarter than your opponent. You can do and be that. You are that. You\u2019re smarter than almost everyone you will encounter, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Sansa nodded and she closed her eyes while she leaned in. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready yet to go to war with you.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m already exhausted after beating one opponent. Let alone ten. Or hundred.\u201d</p><p>Jon wrapped his arms around her and she felt a soft kiss on her forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s something we can work on.\u201d He tightened his grip. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be the nightmare of every soldier, Sansa Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe.\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be the nightmare of everyone who dares to cross us.\u201c</p></p>",
