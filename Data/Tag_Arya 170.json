There was no place to hide, no tricks to\u00a0play, no way to be safe.</p><p>For most of the Asoiaf series, Arya had managed to escape several sticky situations bc of her courage, her intelligence and her ability to act quickly. But imagine how much of a strong possibility there was for the Mountain to pick her for questioning. I mean out of her &ldquo;pack&rdquo; she was the one who had a sword and who had tried to fight back and even  bite one of his men. It makes me shudder to even think about it. After all there really were no tricks to play and in Arya&rsquo;s own words, she felt more like a lamb than anything else.  There was a time when she was so mentally exhausted that she even began to think that bravery really didn&rsquo;t matter. </p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>What good did it do you to be brave? One of the women picked for questioning had tried to be brave, but she had died screaming like all the rest.\u00a0There were no brave people on that march, only scared and hungry ones.</p><p>Arya Stark had always been brave. At the Trident, at that time when she knew that she had to let Nymeria go, before the queen, during her escape from the Red Keep, during her father&rsquo;s execution, when she finally left KL and during her time on the road with Yoren. And thus it really hurts to see the kind of hopelessness she was forcibly pushed to by these men. She even had to learn to hold her tongue. The soldiers saw to that.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Their captors permitted no chatter. A broken lip taught Arya to hold her tongue. Others never learned at all. One boy of three would not stop calling for his father, so they smashed his face in with a spiked mace. Then the boy&rsquo;s mother started screaming and Raff the Sweetling killed her as well.</p><p>It is purely my own opinion but I think during this time Arya might have developed certain suicidal tendencies. After all she was not only made to witness the merciless torture and death of her fellow companions but she also had to see how the women were raped by the soldiers. And yes I am using the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; bc I am pretty sure that none of the women out there truly wanted to be physically intimate with those men.  One of them eventually did lash out by hitting a soldier with a rock. She was of course publicly and brutally executed by the Mountain. It was during this time that Arya thought that it was good that Polliver had taken away Needle, otherwise she would have tried to run it through Sir Gregor.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Arya glanced sidelong at Needle, sheathed at the hip of a black-bearded, balding man-at-arms called Polliver. It&rsquo;s good that they took it away, she thought. Otherwise she would have tried to stab Ser Gregor, and he would have cut her right in half, and the wolves would eat her too.</p><p>What gives me a pause here is the last few lines. Yes it&rsquo;s true that Arya had always been one to abhor cruelty and protested against it. But in the last line, it seems like Arya knew that she was no match for the Mountain and that he could easily apprehend her and kill her. So it just feels very morbid that she would    consider doing so even when she knew the harm it would cause her. </p><p>All in all, I just want to say that Arya Stark  suffered a lot and yet somehow, despite everything she held on. She was strong, intelligent, cautious and very adaptive to her situations. I am just very happy that she was able to escape the Mountain and his men. </p>",

You\u2019re doing great.</p><p>All you who are reading theories by people you disagree with because you think its important to take in other views?

If you love Daenerys and hate seeing hate against her? Block the tags, scroll past the posts etc. If you love Sansa and hate seeing hate against her? Same thing. If you hate a theory? Just keep scrolling. Don\u2019t make yourself angry. Its not worth it.</p><p>If you\u2019re part of the ship war, you don\u2019t have to wage a battle on every post that disagrees with you.

And the woman who smelled of iron and flame was no longer what she once was either, if the rumors were to be believed.</p><p>Still, as she watched the reunion below, her worn heart gave a dangerous thump. He looked so much like Father.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s cool courtesies were pleasant, if expected. Jon had bent the knee. She was no longer an extant princess, just another Lady of Winterfell, preparing the castle and the North for the wars to come. She had done an admirable job, but now Jon had returned with the Dragon Queen firmly in tow.</p><p>He looked tired, the stern creases around his mouth and eyes much more pronounced than when he had been a boy&ndash; a boy that called her <i>little sister</i>&nbsp;and tousled her hair. And yet&hellip; He looked content, his eyes warm and calm, his stride sure and determined, but when he reached out to the Dragon Queen&rsquo;s hand, Arya sputtered in surprise. She had never even seen him touch another woman outside of family, and yet here he was, tucking the Queen&rsquo;s petite hand into the crook of his arm with a grace and ease that would have befuddled anyone who had known him before.</p><p>The Wall had made a man out of the boy she had known. The Wall, or else&hellip;</p><p>Her eyes settled on the Queen. She was as beautiful as they said, moonglow hair, violet eyes, royal bearing&ndash; no dragons that had been spotted yet, but Arya knew they couldn&rsquo;t be far. A thrill lit through her blood at the thought.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Dragons.</i></p><p>She would live to see dragons! Magic that had vanished from the world now mysteriously present once more, all thanks to the tiny woman below.</p><p>Sansa stepped aside and Jon swept toward the keep, his eyes automatically looking up to the balcony on which she hid, his gaze searching and finally lighting on her. She should have known she would never be able to hide from him, that their souls would recognize each other, at long last their wolf&rsquo;s blood would call to the other.</p><p>A smile broke across his face, a true smile, one that he seemed to save only for her, and before she knew it, her feet were flying unbidden toward the stairs, pounding down the snow covered planks until even that distance was too great and she threw herself over the railing and into his waiting arms.</p><p>It took a moment for her to realize that the sound she was hearing was laughter&ndash; his and hers mingling together in perfect harmony. The toes of her boots barely scraped the snow below her, Jon&rsquo;s arms wrapped around her as she burrowed her face into the furs at his neck, breathing in the particular scent of him&ndash; snow and sweat and something just so wholly <i>Jon</i>&nbsp;that it was difficult to pull away.</p><p>All too soon she heard Sansa clearing her throat behind her, the shuffling of feet as the rest of the procession had come to an abrupt halt, and Jon ruefully set her back on her feet, his gloved hands cupping her cheeks as he stared down at her in wonder.</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d see you again,&rdquo; his gruff voice sounded in her ear as he crushed her to him again.<br /></p><p>The lump in her throat wouldn&rsquo;t allow her to answer, so instead she clung to him, her fingers scrabbling in his cloak.</p><p>A girl was Arya Stark of Winterfell, and now&ndash; she was truly home.&nbsp;</p><p>All to soon he released her and stepped back, his hand reaching out to the Dragon Queen who took it with all the grace she could muster, the small smile upon her lips much more natural and at ease than she had been with Sansa just moments before.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya, may I present Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Arya offered a slight bow, the Queen&rsquo;s lips quirking slightly as she nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Daenerys,&rdquo; his familiarity did not go unnoticed, and Arya raised an eyebrow in response,&nbsp;&ldquo;this is my youngest sister, Arya Stark.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Daenerys </i>had the decency to blush as Jon pulled her closer to his side, his hands lingering a moment too long. Her violet eyes searched hers before she spoke. &ldquo;I have heard much about you, Lady Arya. I look forward to knowing you better, and through my own experiences, rather than that of a beloved brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; Arya replied, her shrewd gaze snapping between Jon and the Queen.&nbsp;&ldquo;I look forward to that too.&rdquo;<br /></p><hr /><p>First time writing an Arya POV&ndash; hopefully I did her justice! Thanks for the prompt JW! heart</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",
