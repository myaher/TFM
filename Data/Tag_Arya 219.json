Perhaps the grumkins had stolen \nher real sister. But Mother had only laughed and said no, Arya was her \ndaughter and Sansa\u2019s trueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa could \nnot think why Mother would want to lie about it, so she supposed it had \nto be true. \u00a0 (Sansa, AGoT) </i></p><p><i>At first she thought she hated\n him for what they\u2019d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes \ndry,<b> she told herself that it had not been Joffrey\u2019s doing, </b>not truly. \nThe queen had done it; she was the one to hate, <b>her and Arya</b>. <b>Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya</b>.
