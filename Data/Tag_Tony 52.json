But even after that movie\u2019s done, it\u2019s highly unlikely we\u2019ll have seen the last of him playing Spider-Man. Think about it: <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-next-spider-man-film-will-be-the-civil-war-of-marve-1796402155\">Feige &amp; co deliberately chose him as <i>the </i>character to guide audiences from the end of phase 3 into phase 4</a>. That sets him up to be one of the key characters of the \u201cnew\u201d generation of MCU heroes (as opposed to the OG Avengers 6). <br/></p><p><b>Why would they jeopardize the audience\u2019s attachment they themselves have nurtured for Peter as Spider-Man in the past 4 movies just to have a new Iron Man, mere months after RDJ\u2019s last appearance in his iconic role? It makes absolutely no sense, and would satisfy exactly 0 people.</b> Say what you want about the decisions the different MCU writers and directors have made about the characters, their goal is to keep the fanbase loyal while also attracting new fans. Turning Peter Parker from his beloved role as Spider-Man into Iron Man Jr. (or whatever) would not be a very smart business decision. Plus, there\u2019s plenty of other characters they can introduce to grow into that role (like Riri Williams).<br/></p><p><b>But OK, let\u2019s put real-world considerations aside, and consider the movies themselves. The following is speculation on my part </b>since Far From Home isn\u2019t out yet, but I\u2019ll attempt to explain the reasoning behind my spec as best as I can. <br/></p><p>It\u2019s obvious that a big part of the emotional arc of Peter in FFH will be him coping with the loss of Tony, who was a father-figure to him. He\u2019s going to be thinking about what he can and should do to carry on Tony\u2019s legacy as Iron Man, to make him proud. We know that, just like Tony, he has a strong affinity for science and tech, and likes to build things (we\u2019ve seen that in Homecoming and it\u2019s alluded to again in the trailer). <b>In a chaotic world still reeling from the loss and sudden return of 50% of the population, Peter will be constantly confronted with the fact that Tony\u2019s death left a big hole behind, not just for him but for everyone who looked up to him both as Tony Stark, tech genius and owner of Stark Industries, and Iron Man, the hero that saved the world several times over.</b></p><p>He\u2019s going to think if he should somehow become the next Iron Man, if he owes it to Tony and all his loved ones to take on the mantle. The fact that he does share certain characteristics with Tony (e.g. the affinity for tech/science) make him pretty qualified for the job. <br/></p><p>But&hellip;he isn\u2019t Tony. He\u2019s Peter Parker. He\u2019s Spider-Man. And Tony believed in him (when no-one else did, to quote Homecoming) <i>as </i>Spider-Man. As part of Peter\u2019s emotional story arc to come to terms with Tony\u2019s loss, he will also come to terms with the fact that he doesn\u2019t have to be next Iron Man, or some kind of Spider-Iron hybrid, to honour Tony\u2019s legacy. <b>He\u2019s going to realize that he should just try and become the best version of himself, and Spider-Man is part of his identity in a way that Iron Man cannot and should never be. </b>He will realize that the best way to make Tony proud is to continue the path Tony encouraged him to stay on in the first place: as a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man learning to take on bigger and harder challenges as he matures from a teenager into a young man.</p><p><b>That\u2019s not to say that after FFH, Peter will completely abandon any kind of connection with Tony/Iron Man. </b>He\u2019s probably always going to have some kind of connection to the OG Avengers, to Stark Industries (and, I hope, to Morgan Stark as an older brother but that remains to be seen), to Tony\u2019s tech and of course to Tony himself. Maybe he\u2019ll pick up some of Tony\u2019s mannerisms or habits. Maybe he\u2019ll start working to improve Karen (together with Ned) just like Tony kept working to improve Jarvis and Friday. <b>Whatever it is, it\u2019s going to be in the details, always there in the background but never intrusive, because this is Peter\u2019s story, not Tony\u2019s. </b><br/></p><p>So yeah, Peter won\u2019t be the next Iron Man. He\u2019s going to continue to grow into his identity as Spider-Man, and be the hero Tony always believed he could be.</p><hr><p><b>Coda - what\u2019s in story for MCU Peter after graduation?</b><br/></p><p>It\u2019s been hinted that since there\u2019s 1 more solo movie to go in his current contract, and FFH takes place during Peter\u2019s Junior year in high school, that his last solo movie will finish up his high school years. If Tom Holland signs on for more movies after that, they\u2019ll probably take place in university and right after graduation. <br/></p><p>This is total speculation based on nothing but my thoughts about where they\u2019re going with this character, but I believe that we\u2019ll see Tony go to a uni like MIT and study something scientific, and then at some point going to work for Otto Octavius. It would fit the character Marvel has set up far better (imo) than having Peter go and work for the Daily Bugle as a photographer. MCU Peter is still working class, but he also has connections (Happy, Pepper, Fury,&hellip;) who know he\u2019s Spider-Man and would not just leave him to struggle financially. They\u2019d want to help him because they like him, but also to honour Tony\u2019s wishes, as they all knew how fond he was of Peter and how he supported Peter\u2019s education and future career. We also have not seen Peter express any interest in becoming a photographer or journalist. <br/></p><p>I don\u2019t see a reason why he would then have to start working for a newspaper just to pay the bills. I don\u2019t know much about the comics, but I remember from the Sam Raimi movies that one of the reasons he did the Daily Bugle gig was because he couldn\u2019t hold down a better-paying job in a science field because his secret identity as Spider-Man required him to disappear at odd hours, which no employer is going to be happy with. However, MCU Peter can go work for a number of businesses (like SI, or maybe with Bruce) where he would have the support of people who know his identity as Spider-Man and would vouch for him and make allowances for him.</p><p> But again, this is just my spec - I\u2019m sure if Marvel wanted to have Peter working for the Daily Bugle, they can make up plenty of reasons why it would make sense. Hell, maybe a side job in college? It could happen. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be his main career.<br/></p>",

As part of Peter\u2019s emotional story arc to come to terms with Tony\u2019s loss, he will also come to terms with the fact that he doesn\u2019t have to be next Iron Man, or some kind of Spider-Iron hybrid, to honour Tony\u2019s legacy. <b>He\u2019s going to realize that he should just try and become the best version of himself, and Spider-Man is part of his identity in a way that Iron Man cannot and should never be. </b>He will realize that the best way to make Tony proud is to continue the path Tony encouraged him to stay on in the first place: as a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man learning to take on bigger and harder challenges as he matures from a teenager into a young man.</p><p><b>That\u2019s not to say that after FFH, Peter will completely abandon any kind of connection with Tony/Iron Man. </b>He\u2019s probably always going to have some kind of connection to the OG Avengers, to Stark Industries (and, I hope, to Morgan Stark as an older brother but that remains to be seen), to Tony\u2019s tech and of course to Tony himself.

It would fit the character Marvel has set up far better (imo) than having Peter go and work for the Daily Bugle as a photographer. MCU Peter is still working class, but he also has connections (Happy, Pepper, Fury,\u2026) who know he\u2019s Spider-Man and would not just leave him to struggle financially. They\u2019d want to help him because they like him, but also to honour Tony\u2019s wishes, as they all knew how fond he was of Peter and how he supported Peter\u2019s education and future career.

I don\u2019t know much about the comics, but I remember from the Sam Raimi movies that one of the reasons he did the Daily Bugle gig was because he couldn\u2019t hold down a better-paying job in a science field because his secret identity as Spider-Man required him to disappear at odd hours, which no employer is going to be happy with. However, MCU Peter can go work for a number of businesses (like SI, or maybe with Bruce) where he would have the support of people who know his identity as Spider-Man and would vouch for him and make allowances for him.</p><p> But again, this is just my spec - I\u2019m sure if Marvel wanted to have Peter working for the Daily Bugle, they can make up plenty of reasons why it would make sense. Hell, maybe a side job in college? It could happen. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be his main career.<br></p></p>",

I don&rsquo;t know much about the comics, but I remember from the Sam Raimi movies that one of the reasons he did the Daily Bugle gig was because he couldn&rsquo;t hold down a better-paying job in a science field because his secret identity as Spider-Man required him to disappear at odd hours, which no employer is going to be happy with. However, MCU Peter can go work for a number of businesses (like SI, or maybe with Bruce) where he would have the support of people who know his identity as Spider-Man and would vouch for him and make allowances for him.</p><p> But again, this is just my spec - I&rsquo;m sure if Marvel wanted to have Peter working for the Daily Bugle, they can make up plenty of reasons why it would make sense. Hell, maybe a side job in college? It could happen. I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be his main career.<br /></p></p>",
