This is a fic rec blog for drarry fics, not only for big writers but especially for new ones. | |\nSo if you're new to the fandom, or simply unrecognised, and need a place to get started, feel free to send me a link to your fic and I'll read it and rec it for you! | |\n2. Support and love for new writers is more than welcome! If you don't like what you read, click back\u2014that's why we have the button\u2014and start another one. | |\n3. Ship and let ship. Your kink isn't my kink and that's okay. | |\n4. Stay out of the forbidden forest, every student who comes out of it alive will be sent straight back home! No exceptions! | |\n(If there are too many fics sent our way it's possible we won't find the time to read them all. We are humans with a family, job and life outside the fandom so please keep that in mind.)||\nArt by @llap115\nhttp://llap115.tumblr.com",
