Right now I am just waiting for meaningless posts to flood Arya&rsquo;s tag because I can guarantee you that even after this article, there are people out there who will surely try to attribute all the negativity onto Arya. I mean just think about all the hate that Arya got during s7. The tags were a mess and people called her a mean psychopath who was &ldquo;threatening her innocent sister&rdquo; in her own home. They  basically turned a blind eye to everything Sansa did. From her sending Brienne away to her going to Bran for the final  confirmation about Arya&rsquo;s &ldquo;treasons&rdquo;. Like Sansa would have killed Arya! But of course no one likes to talked about that. Why would they? It will mar the perfect image they have of their favourite.</p>",

If it doesn\u2019t, well, the Arya/Gendry talk is at about the 16:00 mark. I also transcribed it (as best I could) if you can\u2019t watch the video. The questions are really hard to hear because they didn\u2019t give the audience a microphone. This question was roughly asking Joe about a reunion between Gendry and Arya and she did mention something about the drastic changes in Arya since he\u2019d last seen her.</p><blockquote><p> <i>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know. I think it would&ndash;like, I know there&rsquo;s an understandable sort of desire for the two characters to meet again. I think it would be really nice for them to&ndash;given all that&rsquo;s happened in the meantime, uhm, particularly for her. I think it&rsquo;d be great for them to reconnect in some way. Obviously so much, as I said, so much has changed in both of them. Particularly for Arya cuz not only we got to witness her journey through the seasons since, but also<i>, uhm,</i>\n\n in terms of how old, you know, thirt&ndash;incredibly formative years. She&rsquo;s grown from a little girl to a young woman. So, I mean, in terms of, yeah, how it will pan out. Who knows I think, I understand everyone&rsquo;s sort of natural desires to see the two characters reunite somewhere.</i></p></blockquote><p>The whole video is enjoyable, and for Joe fans, DAYUM, he looks good!!!!! <br/></p><p>As for Gendrya, I thought this was pretty positive. There was no going back to the uncomfortable references from before. I also thought it was interesting how he started to say \u201cthirteen\u201d when mentioning her age when she first roughly started on this journey (if that is what he said, it sounded like it to me) and then cut himself off. Make of that what you will. If he did say that, I wonder if it\u2019s because they (being him, GOT\u2019s in general) want to stay away from definitive age counts and such when talking about when we first/last saw Arya and Gendry together.<br/></p><p>Also, he casually said that Arya is now a young woman (key word on <b>woman</b>!) Of all word choices to talk about getting that people want to see Arya and Gendry reunite he chose \u201c<b>desire</b>\u201d not once, but twice to begin and end his answer. And he began and ended his statement with the idea that <b>that desire was understandable and natural</b>.</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019m taking this one as a win!!! Go Team!Gendrya!! WOOHOO!<br/></p>",
