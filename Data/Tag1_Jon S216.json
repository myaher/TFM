He had risen from the dead, she transformed into a dragon. He wasn\u2019t just another bastard anymore, he was the prince who was promised. She was no longer an outlaw, she was the princess of the forest. When the two finally cross paths they become forever tangled in the lives of one another. History, however, reveals that the prince and the princess\u2019s fates have always been connected to each other.</p><!-- more --><p><i>&ldquo;But what is your birth name?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Princess of the Forest.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Ems\u2026 Did you hear us?&rdquo;</p><p>Standing on the rock balcony a woman in forest green stares out to the dragons soaring in the air. She hears people talking behind her but not the words they are saying. The only words she hears are the ones in her head. But what is your birth name? Only a few months ago did Daenerys Targaryen speak those words to her. Everyone believed her to be dead in the sea or just some story, they thought they saw the last of the Savages after the war. Now the world knows she&rsquo;s very much alive and back in her homeland, Westeros, at Dragonstone. Breathing in the old yet familiar air Emilia Savage smiles in raw joy. She never thought she see the day, hell, she never thought she live to see the day. After a moment Daenerys moves to stand beside Emilia before whispering.</p><p>&ldquo;You know\u2026 Conversating in these discussions would be very helpful for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need my input, Danny.&rdquo; Emilia says as she watches the waves crash onto the shore, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just another outlaw in Westeros.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Lady Savage.&rdquo; Tyrion Lannister speaks up from behind them, &ldquo;We all know you&rsquo;re much, much more than another outlaw. What do the Dothraki call you again? Queen\u2026 Princess something&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Goddess of the forest.&rdquo; Emilia answers with a knowing smile, she can just feel the shit eating grin Tyrion is wearing as she points out, &ldquo;The Dothraki aren&rsquo;t the most civilized people though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess not\u2026&rdquo; He sighs dramatically before saying cockily, &ldquo;But as I recall before you were exiled from Westeros you were known a Princess of the Forest.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s true she&rsquo;s been named a lot of things on the line of Princess of the forest, that was her purest one. For a good minute, she was known as an outlaw and trader to the seven kingdoms. Her mother after spent all her time-saving nature and animals, when she was born they named her a princess of the forest. Her father was a friend and counseled the Targaryen family. Everyone loved her parents and herself, everyone said their name (Savage) fit their character in the best yet worst ways. Just before war broke the Baratheon and Lannister made the people believe they were more demonic than gifted. Once war hit her parents were killed and she was exiled, Robert Baratheon offered good money for her head once king. Rumor spread that she died on her way to Essos but no one could find a body. Baratheon then made their family out to seem like a make-believe story. When she made it to Essos she fought for her freedom for a long time until someone was finally able to chain her in a cave without being able to escape no matter what shape. That was until Danny became Khaleesi for the second time.</p><p>&ldquo;All Tyrion is trying to say is\u2026&rdquo; Daenerys speaks up in a warm tone besides the woman in forest green, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no longer exiled or an outlaw. You are the Princess of the Forest, embarrass it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running half my life, I&rsquo;ve been in a cage the other half,&rdquo; Emilia lets out a shaky breath as a dragon soars right past her, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take a few more speeches from you and Tyrion to make me embarrass what got me exiled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were exiled by people who fear your family.&rdquo; Lord Varys speaks up, &ldquo;Not of who you are.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;My brother, Visery, told me a story when I was young. About the Kingdom of Savages.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh? So you&rsquo;ve heard that bedtime story.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Remembering the first conversation Emilia had with Daenerys she turns around and looks at everyone in the room. The room was truly filled with misfits, everyone in the room was here from being exiled, banished, or formerly enslaved. Everyone surrounds the table shape map as they stare at Daenerys and Emilia at the balcony. Tyrion stands next to Lord Varys as they wait for the women to speak. Missandei and Grey Worm stand beside one another across the table. Melisandre paces around the table in her red cloak. So many important people who have been pushed aside are here looking to Daenerys and yet Emilia. They were all here for the last Targaryen but Emilia has somehow gained their respect in this past few months. Leaning on a post Emilia speaks up for all to hear.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not royalty anymore, my kingdom is gone, nor am I the titles people have given me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course Lady Savage\u2026&rdquo; Moving to stand beside Tyrion while looking at the map Daenerys waves a hand and points out, &ldquo;But your family has counseled mine for centuries. So it&rsquo;s only fair I ask for your advice in these critical times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Advice on what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On Jon Snow.&rdquo; Daenerys answers while looking at the woman by the balcony, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s King of the North now. He&rsquo;s Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard, was a Commander of the Knight Watch too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ned Stark?&rdquo; She repeats the name under her breath in disbelief, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t- Who is he to the Seven Kingdoms?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was the Warden of the North, an ally of Robert Baratheon during the rebellion, was also his second hand later on.&rdquo; Lord Varys answers confused on why she&rsquo;s asking, &ldquo;Well, before Robert&rsquo;s son executed him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was beloved by many.&rdquo; Tyrion then adds when seeing the wheels turn in Emilia&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;One of the most honorable, respected, and righteous men I&rsquo;ve known. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I..&rdquo; A million memories flash in her mind before saying with an unreadable expression, &ldquo;I thought you were talking about someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I still need advice on this Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the man\u2026 This is the first I&rsquo;ve heard of him.&rdquo; Emilia walks down to where everyone is standing, &ldquo;But I know a bastard does not become a Commander and a King so easily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say we invite him here.&rdquo; Tyrion speaks up while looking at the women, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an old friend of mine, I trust him. He&rsquo;s one of the most honorable men I&rsquo;ve met. Let&rsquo;s see if he&rsquo;ll bend the knee and become an ally of ours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t bend the knee.&rdquo; The Forest Princess says instantly while looking to the ocean again, &ldquo;Have you ever met a King or Queen bend the knee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did.&rdquo; Melisandre points out while looking around, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m correct.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bend the knee.&rdquo; Emilia spits out while putting on a humorless smile as she stares at the woman in red, &ldquo;I made a deal with Daenerys. Even if I did bend the knee I was no kingdom to call myself a Queen or Princess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean no kingdom?&rdquo; Lord Varys asks very intrigued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the rumors about the Kingdom of Savages. If it&rsquo;s a real Kingdom it just doesn&rsquo;t disappear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When my family died and I vanished there was no one to rule my kingdom.&rdquo; Emilia starts walking toward the bald man, &ldquo;There was no one to find safety for them, no one to help them find food. So they dispersed from one another. My Kingdom was built to help them stay safe from humans and other animals. Without my family the Kingdom is nothing, we held the Kingdom together by being the Kingdom. Animals now look after themselves and only themselves because of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here now.&rdquo; He points out while looking down at the table, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you form our Kingdom once more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not bring a kingdom from the ashes just to have it fall again.&rdquo; Emilia declares while slamming her hands on the table, &ldquo;I will not make them go through that again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They would for you, though.&rdquo; Melisandre speaks up once more knowingly, &ldquo;They sense your presence here already, I can tell. More birds, deer, snakes have crossed my path since I&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know they want to. They&rsquo;ve told me.&rdquo; Emilia sighs while looking at her tiredly, &ldquo;But I do not plan to become a Queen of any kind for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your birthright-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; Daenerys announces while looking at Emilia sympathetically, &ldquo;What she decides to do with her fallen Kingdom is her choice and her choice alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But her family-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would want her to make the decision on her own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a princess. Only in stories. Let&rsquo;s keep it that way.&rdquo;</p><hr><p><i>&ldquo;The Savage Family is in here! Ready your weapons!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Run! Emilia, Run!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, Papa! I won&rsquo;t leave you!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Elizabeth! Get her out of here!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Noooo, Papa!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you my little forest princess.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sobbing Emilia, not a day over 7, gets pulled by her mother toward a servant door in the Castle at King&rsquo;s Landing. She trying to get out of Elizabeth&rsquo;s, her mother&rsquo;s, grasps while yelling for her father. Her mother holds her tightly as she pulls her to the door and slams it open with her back. Pulling her daughter in they see their father and husband, Thomas Savage, smile at them in fear before looking back at the grand doors in front of them and shape into a large size bear. He roars as the guards coming rushing in with swords and spears. Her mother holds her mouth from screaming loudly as they attack her father. He begins chopping their heads clean off and swinging his claws but more and more come. He keeps fighting as they stabbing him until he&rsquo;s laying on the floor in his own blood. Elizabeth quietly shuts the door before running down the narrow hall with her daughter crying in her arms. Today was the first day of Robert Baratheon&rsquo;s rebellion.</i></p><p><i>For weeks now the Savage family knew the lies Baratheon and Lannister were feeding the public. It was only a matter of time until they came for their heads. They only wished they had got their daughter out of the Capital before it happened but here they are. Running and fighting to save Emilia&rsquo;s life, the only life that mattered to them. The Targaryens were also fighting to escape the Capital, they had no clue where they were but they know they&rsquo;re in the same boat as them. Emilia had no clue what was going on, she still thought the people liked her family. Her parents didn&rsquo;t tell her about the rumor and plots against them. She was only now starting to shape into animals and they didn&rsquo;t want her to think it&rsquo;s bad to have that gift. Running down the hall Emilia&rsquo;s mother whispers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be okay. You&rsquo;ll be safe, I promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They killed Pa-pa.&rdquo; She cries into her mother&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;Why? Mother, how could they?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;People do unspeakable things when in fear.&rdquo; She answers in quick breaths, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my princess, I won&rsquo;t let them do anything to you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Her mother turns right and sees a soldier looking around the hall making her run straight. The next door she sees she pulls Emilia in with her. It&rsquo;s a small room for of cleaning mops and brooms. Going to the corner Elizabeth sits down and covers her daughter with her body. Her mother motions for them to stay quiet with her finger before looking at the door they came from. The two of them watch is without making a sound as guards run by. As they listen they hear the soldiers talking to one another.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Robert wants everyone in the Targaryen and Savage family dead.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Viserys and Daenerys already escaped from King&rsquo;s Landing we have a search party for them right now.&rdquo; One of them speaks up tiredly, &ldquo;Everyone else is dead in their family.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And the Savage family?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;All of them but Elizabeth and Emilia.&rdquo; Another answers, &ldquo;But they are still in the castle.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Make sure they don&rsquo;t leave then. Robert wants their heads.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The conversation dies down and the girls hear footsteps walking away. Elizabeth&rsquo;s head lifts up as she listens, her ears turn into wolf ears as she sees if anyone is still out there. Standing up and pulling her daughter hands for her to follow she goes to the door. Listening one last time her ears turn back into her own and looks to Emilia. Mouthing to stay quiet she slowly opens the door and looks around before running to the hall on the left and down to the end. At the end is a wooden door, Elizabeth looks between the cracks and sees a man under as hood. Knowing who it is she opens the door and runs to him with Emilia. Sighing in relief she hugs him tightly before whispering.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thank you, Ned. My family is in your debt.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No need to thank me.&rdquo; He smiles before taking off the hood to show longish ginger hair, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right thing to do, your grace.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Emilia, honey.&rdquo; Kneeling down to her daughter Elizabeth says frantically, &ldquo;This young man is going to help you cross the seas to Essos.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What about you, mother?&rdquo; Emilia asks while looking at her then to the boy, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take to long if we both go right now.&rdquo; She explains while looking around for guards, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you in Essos after everything is said and done.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to leave without you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ned will take good care of you. He&rsquo;s an honorable man.&rdquo; She says while tugging her to his horse, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re on the fastest ship to Essos. He&rsquo;s the only one you can trust, okay? No you know can be trusted besides me and him. Listen to me, don&rsquo;t let anyone know who you are until we&rsquo;re together again.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why does he have the Rebellion&rsquo;s uniform on then?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; She snaps while pulling her onto the horse before Ned does too, &ldquo;What matters is you&rsquo;re going to be Princess that was promised is going to be safe.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you mean the Princess that was promised!&rdquo; Emilia cries wanting to go back into her mother&rsquo;s arms, &ldquo;Mother! What&rsquo;s going on? Come with me! Please!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you everything once we&rsquo;re in Essos. Together.&rdquo; Her mother then starts spilling tears from her own eyes, &ldquo;I love you. Whatever happens, Emilia, don&rsquo;t you forget, you&rsquo;re the Princess of the Forest. No one can take your birthright away from you. Now you have to go-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; A guard shouts from the door they came out of, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re under arrest.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Go! Now! Ned, keep her safe!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I will, I promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Turning toward the soldiers running toward them Elizabeth breaths fire out of her own mouth and burns the first three to ashes. Ned puts on his hood again and rides off, Emilia hold onto him while screaming for her mother. As they reach the edge of the forest Emilia looks back and sees her mother start to shape into a dragon. Before she could completely form a hand full of guards stab her causing her to fall onto the ground. She lays there unmoving, half of her is a human and the other a dragon. Emilia watches as they cut off her head before running toward them into the forest. Shouting to the stranger she&rsquo;s riding with she points to the soldiers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re following us!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose them in the forest, don&rsquo;t worry, Princess.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What if they don&rsquo;t? Can you survive in a forest?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Stark, Princess. Once you&rsquo;ve lived in the North you can live anywhere.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Stark of Winterfell?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes. Eddard Stark at your service, but you may call me Ned.&rdquo;</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Danny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come in, your grace.&rdquo;</p><p>She immediately announces when realizing its the rightful era to the throne. Daenerys comes in with her white silky hair in braids, her outfit was shades of black. She looks so different to Emilia from when they were in Essos, then again they both looked different. Emilia wasn&rsquo;t wearing peasant rages anymore, instead, she was dressed in a forest green color dress that clung to her body. Her hair has grown since their first meeting and is now long thick curls that reach her hips. Standing in Emilia&rsquo;s chamber Daenerys look around to find a large blue snake in the center of the bed before announcing.</p><p>&ldquo;A raven has arrived. Tyrion Lannister was right, Jon Snow will be joining us in a few days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hear from the forest that he isn&rsquo;t coming to bend the knee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why would he come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My friends aren&rsquo;t explaining his reasoning clearly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see\u2026 Nonetheless, we will try to convince him to.&rdquo; She nods before turning back to the door and offering, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all having supper in the dining hall if you care to join us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, your grace.&rdquo; Emilia nods with a small smile before adding, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll have to pass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; She opens the door before saying one last thing, &ldquo;I just want to say if you wanted to unite your Kingdom once again\u2026 I fully support it. You would be on my council, I would see your people as one of my own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I appreciate that.&rdquo; The Forest Princess smiles sadly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not built for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ems.&rdquo; Danny laughs lightly as look at her in pure honestly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like me. We were born for it.&rdquo;</p><p>With that said she leaves as fast as she came making Emilia continue to pace in front of her bed. The snake watches the scene in front of it without moving, its tongue then makes a sound that causes Emilia to send an annoyed look it&rsquo;s way. Stopping the sound the snake moves to snuggle closer to itself. It&rsquo;s a long large snake that&rsquo;s dark blue, a very rare species. Emilia&rsquo;s always been able to communicate with animals, all the language seems to be one in her mind but she knows that&rsquo;s because of her blood. All sounds animals make sounds like words to her, however, it was hard understanding them when they don&rsquo;t know all the words possible to say. Standing in front of the rare blue snake she says out loud to it.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t none of you tell me about who Ned really was?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask, your Grace.&rdquo; The Snake speaks up in a smooth light tone accent, &ldquo;We thought you knew he was a Commander of the Rebellion. You&rsquo;re mother did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t tell me that. How could she at the time? She only told me to trust him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was right to.&rdquo; The snake agrees while adding, &ldquo;He only does what is best and most honorable. That&rsquo;s all he knows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They why betray his king for us, for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he knew the real Rebellions intentions. The war was built on a lie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Queen that was Promised. That&rsquo;s why they burnt your kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make sense!&rdquo; She yells while throwing a chair to the wall, &ldquo;Everyone has told me I was the Princess that was Promised! But what the Hell was I Promised?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were promised the lands you stand on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you but that doesn&rsquo;t clear anything up for me.&rdquo; Emilia sighs while falling against the wall to sit down, &ldquo;That still doesn&rsquo;t explain why Ned, the second hand of Baratheon, spared my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will see in time.&rdquo;</p><hr><p><i>&ldquo;This ship will take you across the sea to Essos. You&rsquo;ll be safer over there.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving me?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, I&rsquo;ve been gone for too long.&rdquo; Ned kneels does in front of the Forest Princess, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving you with enough gold to last you a year, Princess.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Ned Stark and Emilia Savage were on a dock in the middle of the night. They both wore hoods to cover their identities. The ship was being boarded with the crew and food as they spoke. The two have been traveling from months to get her here. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, both of them had to hide who they were completely making their trip last longer than it should. Taking out a knife Ned, a young soldier, has it to the little girl before hugging her and whispering.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;When the war is said and done I&rsquo;ll go to Essos to check up on you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; She puts the knife away and hugs him tightly, &ldquo;Thank you. For everything. I won&rsquo;t forget. The Forest won&rsquo;t forget what you have done for my family.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are the Princess that was Promised.&rdquo; He pulls away and tucks in some hair of hers that was falling out, &ldquo;We will meet again\u2026 Now listen, I trust this crew. They promised to keep you safe till you&rsquo;re in Essos. They gave me their word, they&rsquo;re allies of your family.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Will I return to Westeros?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; He smiles while standing up, &ldquo;Your kingdom will need you to return after all.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;To war\u2026 Then to find my sister.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I hope you find her. Best of luck to you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And to you, your Grace.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The part ways on the dock, she heads to the ship and him to his horse. The Captain greets her by kneeling and she nods for him to stand up. Before she goes onto the ship she looks back to Ned Stark who quickly heads to his horse. They&rsquo;ve spent so much time with one another to get here. They&rsquo;ve spoken vaguely about one another&rsquo;s lives and what the future holds for them but it seems like she knows him so well. He did after betraying Robert for her family, reasons no one has told her. She&rsquo;s still internally grateful but thinking about what has happened one last time she runs to him. He turns when hearing her little feet running and sees her jump to hug him one last time. He hugs her back as he hears her asks in a whimpering whisper.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you can\u2026 Can you properly barry my parents?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Princess.&rdquo; He whispers before saying one last thing, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget what they stood for, don&rsquo;t forget who you are.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, Ned. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to arrive, my King.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Davos.&rdquo; Jon stares down at his desk, &ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That Daenerys Targaryen found the lost Princess of the Forest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After what we&rsquo;ve seen nothing is truly impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon Snow thinks while looking over a map below the ship. He&rsquo;s in his chambers by his desk as he looks at the map. Davos Seaworth was by the door watching him with his hands behind his back. The set out a week ago to meet with this so-called Queen. They have no plans to bend the knee. Only to get fire glass for the war beyond the wall. They know why the Targaryen girl invited them here but it is not why they are coming. His sister was very displeased with him leaving Winterfell but without fire glass, they have no chance. Ever since she came back to Westeros people have begun saying she didn&rsquo;t only bring back three dragons and the Dothraki but a legend back to life. Emilia Savage. Jon would never tell anyone but the moment he heard these rumors he opened every book he could find about the story his father use to tell. Wondering if it was true, wondering if his father knew that the made-up story he&rsquo;s always told them was real. Turning to Davos the King of the North asks with an honest expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you believe it? The stories, the legends, what people are saying now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; He says while coming into the room more, &ldquo;I remember my crew members talking about a ship sinking from Robert&rsquo;s soldiers many years ago during the war. They said there was a Princess on the ship and her body never left it. It was only a story though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read every history date in every book in Winterfell.&rdquo; Jon says as he starts taking out books from his shelves, &ldquo;None of the books talk or even mention The Kingdom of Savages or House Savage. Or even the Princess you talk of. If it isn&rsquo;t just a bedtime story why isn&rsquo;t there any proof of them existing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\u2026 I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He sighs while sitting down tiredly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard many stories and most of them I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re real or not. The whole point of a story is to believe in it even if it isn&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But listen to me, Davos. If what everyone saying is true\u2026&rdquo; Jon finds the book he&rsquo;s looking for and opens it while heading over to the man, &ldquo;Then Robert killed her family so he could be King instead of her family and instead of admitting that, he lied to the world saying this family, this girl.&rdquo; He lifts up a child&rsquo;s book with a picture of a girl turning into a lion it, &ldquo;Is just a scary bedtime story parents tell. Do you realize how cruel that is? To wipe out an inter family&rsquo;s history just to be named the real King. The only thing you can read about them is in children&rsquo;s books and they all are a little different.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, which one is the true story?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I plan to ask.&rdquo; Jon sits down next to Davos while flipping through the book and explaining, &ldquo;I never knew how my father could tell her story so true, it felt like the story about her was real. And it was this whole time. He knew this whole time she was real, that her gift was real. The worst part about all this\u2026 is that it was real but that woman had to pretend her family, her kingdom, her magic wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all we know, the stories could have been more than what it actually was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My father words are never less than what they are.&rdquo; Jon shuts the book and reads the title while mumbling, &ldquo;I know he told that story as true as he could.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.&rdquo;</p>",

He had risen from the dead, she transformed into a dragon. He wasn\u2019t just another bastard anymore, he was the prince who was promised. She was no longer an outlaw, she was the princess of the forest. When the two finally cross paths they become forever tangled in the lives of one another. History, however, reveals that the prince and the princess\u2019s fates have always been connected to each other.</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>\u201cBut what is your birth name?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPrincess of the Forest.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cEms\u2026 Did you hear us?\u201d</p><p>Standing on the rock balcony a woman in forest green stares out to the dragons soaring in the air. She hears people talking behind her but not the words they are saying. The only words she hears are the ones in her head. But what is your birth name? Only a few months ago did Daenerys Targaryen speak those words to her. Everyone believed her to be dead in the sea or just some story, they thought they saw the last of the Savages after the war. Now the world knows she\u2019s very much alive and back in her homeland, Westeros, at Dragonstone. Breathing in the old yet familiar air Emilia Savage smiles in raw joy. She never thought she see the day, hell, she never thought she live to see the day. After a moment Daenerys moves to stand beside Emilia before whispering.</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2026 Conversating in these discussions would be very helpful for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need my input, Danny.\u201d Emilia says as she watches the waves crash onto the shore, \u201cI\u2019m just another outlaw in Westeros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come now, Lady Savage.\u201d Tyrion Lannister speaks up from behind them, \u201cWe all know you\u2019re much, much more than another outlaw. What do the Dothraki call you again? Queen\u2026 Princess something\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Goddess of the forest.\u201d Emilia answers with a knowing smile, she can just feel the shit eating grin Tyrion is wearing as she points out, \u201cThe Dothraki aren\u2019t the most civilized people though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess not\u2026\u201d He sighs dramatically before saying cockily, \u201cBut as I recall before you were exiled from Westeros you were known a Princess of the Forest.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true she\u2019s been named a lot of things on the line of Princess of the forest, that was her purest one. For a good minute, she was known as an outlaw and trader to the seven kingdoms. Her mother after spent all her time-saving nature and animals, when she was born they named her a princess of the forest. Her father was a friend and counseled the Targaryen family. Everyone loved her parents and herself, everyone said their name (Savage) fit their character in the best yet worst ways. Just before war broke the Baratheon and Lannister made the people believe they were more demonic than gifted. Once war hit her parents were killed and she was exiled, Robert Baratheon offered good money for her head once king. Rumor spread that she died on her way to Essos but no one could find a body. Baratheon then made their family out to seem like a make-believe story. When she made it to Essos she fought for her freedom for a long time until someone was finally able to chain her in a cave without being able to escape no matter what shape. That was until Danny became Khaleesi for the second time.</p><p>\u201cAll Tyrion is trying to say is\u2026\u201d Daenerys speaks up in a warm tone besides the woman in forest green, \u201cYou\u2019re no longer exiled or an outlaw. You are the Princess of the Forest, embarrass it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been running half my life, I\u2019ve been in a cage the other half,\u201d Emilia lets out a shaky breath as a dragon soars right past her, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a few more speeches from you and Tyrion to make me embarrass what got me exiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were exiled by people who fear your family.\u201d Lord Varys speaks up, \u201cNot of who you are.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cMy brother, Visery, told me a story when I was young. About the Kingdom of Savages.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh? So you\u2019ve heard that bedtime story.\u201d</i></p><p>Remembering the first conversation Emilia had with Daenerys she turns around and looks at everyone in the room. The room was truly filled with misfits, everyone in the room was here from being exiled, banished, or formerly enslaved. Everyone surrounds the table shape map as they stare at Daenerys and Emilia at the balcony. Tyrion stands next to Lord Varys as they wait for the women to speak. Missandei and Grey Worm stand beside one another across the table. Melisandre paces around the table in her red cloak. So many important people who have been pushed aside are here looking to Daenerys and yet Emilia. They were all here for the last Targaryen but Emilia has somehow gained their respect in this past few months. Leaning on a post Emilia speaks up for all to hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not royalty anymore, my kingdom is gone, nor am I the titles people have given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Lady Savage\u2026\u201d Moving to stand beside Tyrion while looking at the map Daenerys waves a hand and points out, \u201cBut your family has counseled mine for centuries. So it\u2019s only fair I ask for your advice in these critical times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Jon Snow.\u201d Daenerys answers while looking at the woman by the balcony, \u201cHe\u2019s King of the North now. He\u2019s Ned Stark\u2019s bastard, was a Commander of the Knight Watch too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed Stark?\u201d She repeats the name under her breath in disbelief, \u201cI can\u2019t- Who is he to the Seven Kingdoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the Warden of the North, an ally of Robert Baratheon during the rebellion, was also his second hand later on.\u201d Lord Varys answers confused on why she\u2019s asking, \u201cWell, before Robert\u2019s son executed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was beloved by many.\u201d Tyrion then adds when seeing the wheels turn in Emilia\u2019s head, \u201cOne of the most honorable, respected, and righteous men I\u2019ve known. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI..\u201d A million memories flash in her mind before saying with an unreadable expression, \u201cI thought you were talking about someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still need advice on this Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the man\u2026 This is the first I\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d Emilia walks down to where everyone is standing, \u201cBut I know a bastard does not become a Commander and a King so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we invite him here.\u201d Tyrion speaks up while looking at the women, \u201cHe\u2019s an old friend of mine, I trust him. He\u2019s one of the most honorable men I\u2019ve met. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll bend the knee and become an ally of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t bend the knee.\u201d The Forest Princess says instantly while looking to the ocean again, \u201cHave you ever met a King or Queen bend the knee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Melisandre points out while looking around, \u201cIf I\u2019m correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bend the knee.\u201d Emilia spits out while putting on a humorless smile as she stares at the woman in red, \u201cI made a deal with Daenerys. Even if I did bend the knee I was no kingdom to call myself a Queen or Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean no kingdom?\u201d Lord Varys asks very intrigued, \u201cI\u2019ve heard the rumors about the Kingdom of Savages. If it\u2019s a real Kingdom it just doesn\u2019t disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my family died and I vanished there was no one to rule my kingdom.\u201d Emilia starts walking toward the bald man, \u201cThere was no one to find safety for them, no one to help them find food. So they dispersed from one another. My Kingdom was built to help them stay safe from humans and other animals. Without my family the Kingdom is nothing, we held the Kingdom together by being the Kingdom. Animals now look after themselves and only themselves because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now.\u201d He points out while looking down at the table, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you form our Kingdom once more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not bring a kingdom from the ashes just to have it fall again.\u201d Emilia declares while slamming her hands on the table, \u201cI will not make them go through that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would for you, though.\u201d Melisandre speaks up once more knowingly, \u201cThey sense your presence here already, I can tell. More birds, deer, snakes have crossed my path since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they want to. They\u2019ve told me.\u201d Emilia sighs while looking at her tiredly, \u201cBut I do not plan to become a Queen of any kind for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthright-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Daenerys announces while looking at Emilia sympathetically, \u201cWhat she decides to do with her fallen Kingdom is her choice and her choice alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut her family-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould want her to make the decision on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a princess. Only in stories. Let\u2019s keep it that way.\u201d</p><hr><p><i>\u201cThe Savage Family is in here! Ready your weapons!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRun! Emilia, Run!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, Papa! I won\u2019t leave you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cElizabeth! Get her out of here!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNoooo, Papa!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you my little forest princess.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sobbing Emilia, not a day over 7, gets pulled by her mother toward a servant door in the Castle at King\u2019s Landing. She trying to get out of Elizabeth\u2019s, her mother\u2019s, grasps while yelling for her father. Her mother holds her tightly as she pulls her to the door and slams it open with her back. Pulling her daughter in they see their father and husband, Thomas Savage, smile at them in fear before looking back at the grand doors in front of them and shape into a large size bear. He roars as the guards coming rushing in with swords and spears. Her mother holds her mouth from screaming loudly as they attack her father. He begins chopping their heads clean off and swinging his claws but more and more come. He keeps fighting as they stabbing him until he\u2019s laying on the floor in his own blood. Elizabeth quietly shuts the door before running down the narrow hall with her daughter crying in her arms. Today was the first day of Robert Baratheon\u2019s rebellion.</i></p><p><i>For weeks now the Savage family knew the lies Baratheon and Lannister were feeding the public. It was only a matter of time until they came for their heads. They only wished they had got their daughter out of the Capital before it happened but here they are. Running and fighting to save Emilia\u2019s life, the only life that mattered to them. The Targaryens were also fighting to escape the Capital, they had no clue where they were but they know they\u2019re in the same boat as them. Emilia had no clue what was going on, she still thought the people liked her family. Her parents didn\u2019t tell her about the rumor and plots against them. She was only now starting to shape into animals and they didn\u2019t want her to think it\u2019s bad to have that gift. Running down the hall Emilia\u2019s mother whispers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay. You\u2019ll be safe, I promise.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey killed Pa-pa.\u201d She cries into her mother\u2019s shoulder, \u201cWhy? Mother, how could they?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPeople do unspeakable things when in fear.\u201d She answers in quick breaths, \u201cYou\u2019re my princess, I won\u2019t let them do anything to you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her mother turns right and sees a soldier looking around the hall making her run straight. The next door she sees she pulls Emilia in with her. It\u2019s a small room for of cleaning mops and brooms. Going to the corner Elizabeth sits down and covers her daughter with her body. Her mother motions for them to stay quiet with her finger before looking at the door they came from. The two of them watch is without making a sound as guards run by. As they listen they hear the soldiers talking to one another.</i></p><p><i>\u201cRobert wants everyone in the Targaryen and Savage family dead.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cViserys and Daenerys already escaped from King\u2019s Landing we have a search party for them right now.\u201d One of them speaks up tiredly, \u201cEveryone else is dead in their family.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the Savage family?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAll of them but Elizabeth and Emilia.\u201d Another answers, \u201cBut they are still in the castle.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMake sure they don\u2019t leave then. Robert wants their heads.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The conversation dies down and the girls hear footsteps walking away. Elizabeth\u2019s head lifts up as she listens, her ears turn into wolf ears as she sees if anyone is still out there. Standing up and pulling her daughter hands for her to follow she goes to the door. Listening one last time her ears turn back into her own and looks to Emilia. Mouthing to stay quiet she slowly opens the door and looks around before running to the hall on the left and down to the end. At the end is a wooden door, Elizabeth looks between the cracks and sees a man under as hood. Knowing who it is she opens the door and runs to him with Emilia. Sighing in relief she hugs him tightly before whispering.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, Ned. My family is in your debt.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d He smiles before taking off the hood to show longish ginger hair, \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, your grace.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cEmilia, honey.\u201d Kneeling down to her daughter Elizabeth says frantically, \u201cThis young man is going to help you cross the seas to Essos.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat about you, mother?\u201d Emilia asks while looking at her then to the boy, \u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019ll take to long if we both go right now.\u201d She explains while looking around for guards, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in Essos after everything is said and done.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave without you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNed will take good care of you. He\u2019s an honorable man.\u201d She says while tugging her to his horse, \u201cHe\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re on the fastest ship to Essos. He\u2019s the only one you can trust, okay? No you know can be trusted besides me and him. Listen to me, don\u2019t let anyone know who you are until we\u2019re together again.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy does he have the Rebellion\u2019s uniform on then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She snaps while pulling her onto the horse before Ned does too, \u201cWhat matters is you\u2019re going to be Princess that was promised is going to be safe.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean the Princess that was promised!\u201d Emilia cries wanting to go back into her mother\u2019s arms, \u201cMother! What\u2019s going on? Come with me! Please!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything once we\u2019re in Essos. Together.\u201d Her mother then starts spilling tears from her own eyes, \u201cI love you. Whatever happens, Emilia, don\u2019t you forget, you\u2019re the Princess of the Forest. No one can take your birthright away from you. Now you have to go-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere she is!\u201d A guard shouts from the door they came out of, \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGo! Now! Ned, keep her safe!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI will, I promise.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Turning toward the soldiers running toward them Elizabeth breaths fire out of her own mouth and burns the first three to ashes. Ned puts on his hood again and rides off, Emilia hold onto him while screaming for her mother. As they reach the edge of the forest Emilia looks back and sees her mother start to shape into a dragon. Before she could completely form a hand full of guards stab her causing her to fall onto the ground. She lays there unmoving, half of her is a human and the other a dragon. Emilia watches as they cut off her head before running toward them into the forest. Shouting to the stranger she\u2019s riding with she points to the soldiers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey\u2019re following us!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019ll lose them in the forest, don\u2019t worry, Princess.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t? Can you survive in a forest?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m a Stark, Princess. Once you\u2019ve lived in the North you can live anywhere.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re a Stark of Winterfell?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes. Eddard Stark at your service, but you may call me Ned.\u201d</i></p><hr><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, your grace.\u201d</p><p>She immediately announces when realizing its the rightful era to the throne. Daenerys comes in with her white silky hair in braids, her outfit was shades of black. She looks so different to Emilia from when they were in Essos, then again they both looked different. Emilia wasn\u2019t wearing peasant rages anymore, instead, she was dressed in a forest green color dress that clung to her body. Her hair has grown since their first meeting and is now long thick curls that reach her hips. Standing in Emilia\u2019s chamber Daenerys look around to find a large blue snake in the center of the bed before announcing.</p><p>\u201cA raven has arrived. Tyrion Lannister was right, Jon Snow will be joining us in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear from the forest that he isn\u2019t coming to bend the knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would he come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends aren\u2019t explaining his reasoning clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Nonetheless, we will try to convince him to.\u201d She nods before turning back to the door and offering, \u201cWe\u2019re all having supper in the dining hall if you care to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, your grace.\u201d Emilia nods with a small smile before adding, \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She opens the door before saying one last thing, \u201cI just want to say if you wanted to unite your Kingdom once again\u2026 I fully support it. You would be on my council, I would see your people as one of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d The Forest Princess smiles sadly, \u201cI\u2019m just not built for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEms.\u201d Danny laughs lightly as look at her in pure honestly, \u201cYou\u2019re like me. We were born for it.\u201d</p><p>With that said she leaves as fast as she came making Emilia continue to pace in front of her bed. The snake watches the scene in front of it without moving, its tongue then makes a sound that causes Emilia to send an annoyed look it\u2019s way. Stopping the sound the snake moves to snuggle closer to itself. It\u2019s a long large snake that\u2019s dark blue, a very rare species. Emilia\u2019s always been able to communicate with animals, all the language seems to be one in her mind but she knows that\u2019s because of her blood. All sounds animals make sounds like words to her, however, it was hard understanding them when they don\u2019t know all the words possible to say. Standing in front of the rare blue snake she says out loud to it.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t none of you tell me about who Ned really was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask, your Grace.\u201d The Snake speaks up in a smooth light tone accent, \u201cWe thought you knew he was a Commander of the Rebellion. You\u2019re mother did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me that. How could she at the time? She only told me to trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was right to.\u201d The snake agrees while adding, \u201cHe only does what is best and most honorable. That\u2019s all he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey why betray his king for us, for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he knew the real Rebellions intentions. The war was built on a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Queen that was Promised. That\u2019s why they burnt your kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d She yells while throwing a chair to the wall, \u201cEveryone has told me I was the Princess that was Promised! But what the Hell was I Promised?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were promised the lands you stand on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you but that doesn\u2019t clear anything up for me.\u201d Emilia sighs while falling against the wall to sit down, \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why Ned, the second hand of Baratheon, spared my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will see in time.\u201d</p><hr><p><i>\u201cThis ship will take you across the sea to Essos. You\u2019ll be safer over there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, I\u2019ve been gone for too long.\u201d Ned kneels does in front of the Forest Princess, \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with enough gold to last you a year, Princess.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ned Stark and Emilia Savage were on a dock in the middle of the night. They both wore hoods to cover their identities. The ship was being boarded with the crew and food as they spoke. The two have been traveling from months to get her here. It wasn\u2019t easy, both of them had to hide who they were completely making their trip last longer than it should. Taking out a knife Ned, a young soldier, has it to the little girl before hugging her and whispering.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen the war is said and done I\u2019ll go to Essos to check up on you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cReally?\u201d She puts the knife away and hugs him tightly, \u201cThank you. For everything. I won\u2019t forget. The Forest won\u2019t forget what you have done for my family.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are the Princess that was Promised.\u201d He pulls away and tucks in some hair of hers that was falling out, \u201cWe will meet again\u2026 Now listen, I trust this crew.

The Captain greets her by kneeling and she nods for him to stand up. Before she goes onto the ship she looks back to Ned Stark who quickly heads to his horse. They\u2019ve spent so much time with one another to get here. They\u2019ve spoken vaguely about one another\u2019s lives and what the future holds for them but it seems like she knows him so well. He did after betraying Robert for her family, reasons no one has told her. She\u2019s still internally grateful but thinking about what has happened one last time she runs to him. He turns when hearing her little feet running and sees her jump to hug him one last time.

I won\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><hr><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to arrive, my King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Davos.\u201d Jon stares down at his desk, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Daenerys Targaryen found the lost Princess of the Forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what we\u2019ve seen nothing is truly impossible.\u201d</p><p>Jon Snow thinks while looking over a map below the ship. He\u2019s in his chambers by his desk as he looks at the map. Davos Seaworth was by the door watching him with his hands behind his back. The set out a week ago to meet with this so-called Queen. They have no plans to bend the knee. Only to get fire glass for the war beyond the wall. They know why the Targaryen girl invited them here but it is not why they are coming. His sister was very displeased with him leaving Winterfell but without fire glass, they have no chance. Ever since she came back to Westeros people have begun saying she didn\u2019t only bring back three dragons and the Dothraki but a legend back to life. Emilia Savage. Jon would never tell anyone but the moment he heard these rumors he opened every book he could find about the story his father use to tell. Wondering if it was true, wondering if his father knew that the made-up story he\u2019s always told them was real. Turning to Davos the King of the North asks with an honest expression.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe it? The stories, the legends, what people are saying now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He says while coming into the room more, \u201cI remember my crew members talking about a ship sinking from Robert\u2019s soldiers many years ago during the war. They said there was a Princess on the ship and her body never left it. It was only a story though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read every history date in every book in Winterfell.\u201d Jon says as he starts taking out books from his shelves, \u201cNone of the books talk or even mention The Kingdom of Savages or House Savage. Or even the Princess you talk of. If it isn\u2019t just a bedtime story why isn\u2019t there any proof of them existing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d He sighs while sitting down tiredly, \u201cI\u2019ve heard many stories and most of them I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re real or not. The whole point of a story is to believe in it even if it isn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut listen to me, Davos. If what everyone saying is true\u2026\u201d Jon finds the book he\u2019s looking for and opens it while heading over to the man, \u201cThen Robert killed her family so he could be King instead of her family and instead of admitting that, he lied to the world saying this family, this girl.\u201d He lifts up a child\u2019s book with a picture of a girl turning into a lion it, \u201cIs just a scary bedtime story parents tell. Do you realize how cruel that is? To wipe out an inter family\u2019s history just to be named the real King. The only thing you can read about them is in children\u2019s books and they all are a little different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, which one is the true story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I plan to ask.\u201d Jon sits down next to Davos while flipping through the book and explaining, \u201cI never knew how my father could tell her story so true, it felt like the story about her was real. And it was this whole time. He knew this whole time she was real, that her gift was real. The worst part about all this\u2026 is that it was real but that woman had to pretend her family, her kingdom, her magic wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all we know, the stories could have been more than what it actually was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father words are never less than what they are.\u201d Jon shuts the book and reads the title while mumbling, \u201cI know he told that story as true as he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p></p>",

He had risen from the dead, she transformed into a dragon. He wasn\u2019t just another bastard anymore, he was the prince who was promised. She was no longer an outlaw, she was the princess of the forest. When the two finally cross paths they become forever tangled in the lives of one another. History, however, reveals that the prince and the princess\u2019s fates have always been connected to each other.</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>\u201cBut what is your birth name?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPrincess of the Forest.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cEms\u2026 Did you hear us?\u201d</p><p>Standing on the rock balcony a woman in forest green stares out to the dragons soaring in the air. She hears people talking behind her but not the words they are saying. The only words she hears are the ones in her head. But what is your birth name? Only a few months ago did Daenerys Targaryen speak those words to her. Everyone believed her to be dead in the sea or just some story, they thought they saw the last of the Savages after the war. Now the world knows she\u2019s very much alive and back in her homeland, Westeros, at Dragonstone. Breathing in the old yet familiar air Emilia Savage smiles in raw joy. She never thought she see the day, hell, she never thought she live to see the day. After a moment Daenerys moves to stand beside Emilia before whispering.</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2026 Conversating in these discussions would be very helpful for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need my input, Danny.\u201d Emilia says as she watches the waves crash onto the shore, \u201cI\u2019m just another outlaw in Westeros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come now, Lady Savage.\u201d Tyrion Lannister speaks up from behind them, \u201cWe all know you\u2019re much, much more than another outlaw. What do the Dothraki call you again? Queen\u2026 Princess something\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Goddess of the forest.\u201d Emilia answers with a knowing smile, she can just feel the shit eating grin Tyrion is wearing as she points out, \u201cThe Dothraki aren\u2019t the most civilized people though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess not\u2026\u201d He sighs dramatically before saying cockily, \u201cBut as I recall before you were exiled from Westeros you were known a Princess of the Forest.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true she\u2019s been named a lot of things on the line of Princess of the forest, that was her purest one. For a good minute, she was known as an outlaw and trader to the seven kingdoms. Her mother after spent all her time-saving nature and animals, when she was born they named her a princess of the forest. Her father was a friend and counseled the Targaryen family. Everyone loved her parents and herself, everyone said their name (Savage) fit their character in the best yet worst ways. Just before war broke the Baratheon and Lannister made the people believe they were more demonic than gifted. Once war hit her parents were killed and she was exiled, Robert Baratheon offered good money for her head once king. Rumor spread that she died on her way to Essos but no one could find a body. Baratheon then made their family out to seem like a make-believe story. When she made it to Essos she fought for her freedom for a long time until someone was finally able to chain her in a cave without being able to escape no matter what shape. That was until Danny became Khaleesi for the second time.</p><p>\u201cAll Tyrion is trying to say is\u2026\u201d Daenerys speaks up in a warm tone besides the woman in forest green, \u201cYou\u2019re no longer exiled or an outlaw. You are the Princess of the Forest, embarrass it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been running half my life, I\u2019ve been in a cage the other half,\u201d Emilia lets out a shaky breath as a dragon soars right past her, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a few more speeches from you and Tyrion to make me embarrass what got me exiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were exiled by people who fear your family.\u201d Lord Varys speaks up, \u201cNot of who you are.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cMy brother, Visery, told me a story when I was young. About the Kingdom of Savages.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh? So you\u2019ve heard that bedtime story.\u201d</i></p><p>Remembering the first conversation Emilia had with Daenerys she turns around and looks at everyone in the room. The room was truly filled with misfits, everyone in the room was here from being exiled, banished, or formerly enslaved. Everyone surrounds the table shape map as they stare at Daenerys and Emilia at the balcony. Tyrion stands next to Lord Varys as they wait for the women to speak. Missandei and Grey Worm stand beside one another across the table. Melisandre paces around the table in her red cloak. So many important people who have been pushed aside are here looking to Daenerys and yet Emilia. They were all here for the last Targaryen but Emilia has somehow gained their respect in this past few months. Leaning on a post Emilia speaks up for all to hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not royalty anymore, my kingdom is gone, nor am I the titles people have given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Lady Savage\u2026\u201d Moving to stand beside Tyrion while looking at the map Daenerys waves a hand and points out, \u201cBut your family has counseled mine for centuries. So it\u2019s only fair I ask for your advice in these critical times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Jon Snow.\u201d Daenerys answers while looking at the woman by the balcony, \u201cHe\u2019s King of the North now. He\u2019s Ned Stark\u2019s bastard, was a Commander of the Knight Watch too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed Stark?\u201d She repeats the name under her breath in disbelief, \u201cI can\u2019t- Who is he to the Seven Kingdoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the Warden of the North, an ally of Robert Baratheon during the rebellion, was also his second hand later on.\u201d Lord Varys answers confused on why she\u2019s asking, \u201cWell, before Robert\u2019s son executed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was beloved by many.\u201d Tyrion then adds when seeing the wheels turn in Emilia\u2019s head, \u201cOne of the most honorable, respected, and righteous men I\u2019ve known. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI..\u201d A million memories flash in her mind before saying with an unreadable expression, \u201cI thought you were talking about someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still need advice on this Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the man\u2026 This is the first I\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d Emilia walks down to where everyone is standing, \u201cBut I know a bastard does not become a Commander and a King so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we invite him here.\u201d Tyrion speaks up while looking at the women, \u201cHe\u2019s an old friend of mine, I trust him. He\u2019s one of the most honorable men I\u2019ve met. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll bend the knee and become an ally of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t bend the knee.\u201d The Forest Princess says instantly while looking to the ocean again, \u201cHave you ever met a King or Queen bend the knee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Melisandre points out while looking around, \u201cIf I\u2019m correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bend the knee.\u201d Emilia spits out while putting on a humorless smile as she stares at the woman in red, \u201cI made a deal with Daenerys. Even if I did bend the knee I was no kingdom to call myself a Queen or Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean no kingdom?\u201d Lord Varys asks very intrigued, \u201cI\u2019ve heard the rumors about the Kingdom of Savages. If it\u2019s a real Kingdom it just doesn\u2019t disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my family died and I vanished there was no one to rule my kingdom.\u201d Emilia starts walking toward the bald man, \u201cThere was no one to find safety for them, no one to help them find food. So they dispersed from one another. My Kingdom was built to help them stay safe from humans and other animals. Without my family the Kingdom is nothing, we held the Kingdom together by being the Kingdom. Animals now look after themselves and only themselves because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now.\u201d He points out while looking down at the table, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you form our Kingdom once more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not bring a kingdom from the ashes just to have it fall again.\u201d Emilia declares while slamming her hands on the table, \u201cI will not make them go through that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would for you, though.\u201d Melisandre speaks up once more knowingly, \u201cThey sense your presence here already, I can tell. More birds, deer, snakes have crossed my path since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they want to. They\u2019ve told me.\u201d Emilia sighs while looking at her tiredly, \u201cBut I do not plan to become a Queen of any kind for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthright-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Daenerys announces while looking at Emilia sympathetically, \u201cWhat she decides to do with her fallen Kingdom is her choice and her choice alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut her family-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould want her to make the decision on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a princess. Only in stories. Let\u2019s keep it that way.\u201d</p><hr><p><i>\u201cThe Savage Family is in here! Ready your weapons!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRun! Emilia, Run!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, Papa! I won\u2019t leave you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cElizabeth! Get her out of here!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNoooo, Papa!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you my little forest princess.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sobbing Emilia, not a day over 7, gets pulled by her mother toward a servant door in the Castle at King\u2019s Landing. She trying to get out of Elizabeth\u2019s, her mother\u2019s, grasps while yelling for her father. Her mother holds her tightly as she pulls her to the door and slams it open with her back. Pulling her daughter in they see their father and husband, Thomas Savage, smile at them in fear before looking back at the grand doors in front of them and shape into a large size bear. He roars as the guards coming rushing in with swords and spears. Her mother holds her mouth from screaming loudly as they attack her father. He begins chopping their heads clean off and swinging his claws but more and more come. He keeps fighting as they stabbing him until he\u2019s laying on the floor in his own blood. Elizabeth quietly shuts the door before running down the narrow hall with her daughter crying in her arms. Today was the first day of Robert Baratheon\u2019s rebellion.</i></p><p><i>For weeks now the Savage family knew the lies Baratheon and Lannister were feeding the public. It was only a matter of time until they came for their heads. They only wished they had got their daughter out of the Capital before it happened but here they are. Running and fighting to save Emilia\u2019s life, the only life that mattered to them. The Targaryens were also fighting to escape the Capital, they had no clue where they were but they know they\u2019re in the same boat as them. Emilia had no clue what was going on, she still thought the people liked her family. Her parents didn\u2019t tell her about the rumor and plots against them. She was only now starting to shape into animals and they didn\u2019t want her to think it\u2019s bad to have that gift. Running down the hall Emilia\u2019s mother whispers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay. You\u2019ll be safe, I promise.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey killed Pa-pa.\u201d She cries into her mother\u2019s shoulder, \u201cWhy? Mother, how could they?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPeople do unspeakable things when in fear.\u201d She answers in quick breaths, \u201cYou\u2019re my princess, I won\u2019t let them do anything to you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her mother turns right and sees a soldier looking around the hall making her run straight. The next door she sees she pulls Emilia in with her. It\u2019s a small room for of cleaning mops and brooms. Going to the corner Elizabeth sits down and covers her daughter with her body. Her mother motions for them to stay quiet with her finger before looking at the door they came from. The two of them watch is without making a sound as guards run by. As they listen they hear the soldiers talking to one another.</i></p><p><i>\u201cRobert wants everyone in the Targaryen and Savage family dead.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cViserys and Daenerys already escaped from King\u2019s Landing we have a search party for them right now.\u201d One of them speaks up tiredly, \u201cEveryone else is dead in their family.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the Savage family?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAll of them but Elizabeth and Emilia.\u201d Another answers, \u201cBut they are still in the castle.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMake sure they don\u2019t leave then. Robert wants their heads.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The conversation dies down and the girls hear footsteps walking away. Elizabeth\u2019s head lifts up as she listens, her ears turn into wolf ears as she sees if anyone is still out there. Standing up and pulling her daughter hands for her to follow she goes to the door. Listening one last time her ears turn back into her own and looks to Emilia. Mouthing to stay quiet she slowly opens the door and looks around before running to the hall on the left and down to the end. At the end is a wooden door, Elizabeth looks between the cracks and sees a man under as hood. Knowing who it is she opens the door and runs to him with Emilia. Sighing in relief she hugs him tightly before whispering.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, Ned. My family is in your debt.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d He smiles before taking off the hood to show longish ginger hair, \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, your grace.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cEmilia, honey.\u201d Kneeling down to her daughter Elizabeth says frantically, \u201cThis young man is going to help you cross the seas to Essos.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat about you, mother?\u201d Emilia asks while looking at her then to the boy, \u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019ll take to long if we both go right now.\u201d She explains while looking around for guards, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in Essos after everything is said and done.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave without you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNed will take good care of you. He\u2019s an honorable man.\u201d She says while tugging her to his horse, \u201cHe\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re on the fastest ship to Essos. He\u2019s the only one you can trust, okay? No you know can be trusted besides me and him. Listen to me, don\u2019t let anyone know who you are until we\u2019re together again.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy does he have the Rebellion\u2019s uniform on then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She snaps while pulling her onto the horse before Ned does too, \u201cWhat matters is you\u2019re going to be Princess that was promised is going to be safe.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean the Princess that was promised!\u201d Emilia cries wanting to go back into her mother\u2019s arms, \u201cMother! What\u2019s going on? Come with me! Please!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything once we\u2019re in Essos. Together.\u201d Her mother then starts spilling tears from her own eyes, \u201cI love you. Whatever happens, Emilia, don\u2019t you forget, you\u2019re the Princess of the Forest. No one can take your birthright away from you. Now you have to go-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere she is!\u201d A guard shouts from the door they came out of, \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGo! Now! Ned, keep her safe!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI will, I promise.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Turning toward the soldiers running toward them Elizabeth breaths fire out of her own mouth and burns the first three to ashes. Ned puts on his hood again and rides off, Emilia hold onto him while screaming for her mother. As they reach the edge of the forest Emilia looks back and sees her mother start to shape into a dragon. Before she could completely form a hand full of guards stab her causing her to fall onto the ground. She lays there unmoving, half of her is a human and the other a dragon. Emilia watches as they cut off her head before running toward them into the forest. Shouting to the stranger she\u2019s riding with she points to the soldiers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey\u2019re following us!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019ll lose them in the forest, don\u2019t worry, Princess.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t? Can you survive in a forest?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m a Stark, Princess. Once you\u2019ve lived in the North you can live anywhere.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re a Stark of Winterfell?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes. Eddard Stark at your service, but you may call me Ned.\u201d</i></p><hr><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, your grace.\u201d</p><p>She immediately announces when realizing its the rightful era to the throne. Daenerys comes in with her white silky hair in braids, her outfit was shades of black. She looks so different to Emilia from when they were in Essos, then again they both looked different. Emilia wasn\u2019t wearing peasant rages anymore, instead, she was dressed in a forest green color dress that clung to her body. Her hair has grown since their first meeting and is now long thick curls that reach her hips. Standing in Emilia\u2019s chamber Daenerys look around to find a large blue snake in the center of the bed before announcing.</p><p>\u201cA raven has arrived. Tyrion Lannister was right, Jon Snow will be joining us in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear from the forest that he isn\u2019t coming to bend the knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would he come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends aren\u2019t explaining his reasoning clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Nonetheless, we will try to convince him to.\u201d She nods before turning back to the door and offering, \u201cWe\u2019re all having supper in the dining hall if you care to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, your grace.\u201d Emilia nods with a small smile before adding, \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She opens the door before saying one last thing, \u201cI just want to say if you wanted to unite your Kingdom once again\u2026 I fully support it. You would be on my council, I would see your people as one of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d The Forest Princess smiles sadly, \u201cI\u2019m just not built for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEms.\u201d Danny laughs lightly as look at her in pure honestly, \u201cYou\u2019re like me. We were born for it.\u201d</p><p>With that said she leaves as fast as she came making Emilia continue to pace in front of her bed. The snake watches the scene in front of it without moving, its tongue then makes a sound that causes Emilia to send an annoyed look it\u2019s way. Stopping the sound the snake moves to snuggle closer to itself. It\u2019s a long large snake that\u2019s dark blue, a very rare species. Emilia\u2019s always been able to communicate with animals, all the language seems to be one in her mind but she knows that\u2019s because of her blood. All sounds animals make sounds like words to her, however, it was hard understanding them when they don\u2019t know all the words possible to say. Standing in front of the rare blue snake she says out loud to it.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t none of you tell me about who Ned really was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask, your Grace.\u201d The Snake speaks up in a smooth light tone accent, \u201cWe thought you knew he was a Commander of the Rebellion. You\u2019re mother did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me that. How could she at the time? She only told me to trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was right to.\u201d The snake agrees while adding, \u201cHe only does what is best and most honorable. That\u2019s all he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey why betray his king for us, for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he knew the real Rebellions intentions. The war was built on a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Queen that was Promised. That\u2019s why they burnt your kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d She yells while throwing a chair to the wall, \u201cEveryone has told me I was the Princess that was Promised! But what the Hell was I Promised?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were promised the lands you stand on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you but that doesn\u2019t clear anything up for me.\u201d Emilia sighs while falling against the wall to sit down, \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why Ned, the second hand of Baratheon, spared my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will see in time.\u201d</p><hr><p><i>\u201cThis ship will take you across the sea to Essos. You\u2019ll be safer over there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, I\u2019ve been gone for too long.\u201d Ned kneels does in front of the Forest Princess, \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with enough gold to last you a year, Princess.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ned Stark and Emilia Savage were on a dock in the middle of the night. They both wore hoods to cover their identities. The ship was being boarded with the crew and food as they spoke. The two have been traveling from months to get her here. It wasn\u2019t easy, both of them had to hide who they were completely making their trip last longer than it should. Taking out a knife Ned, a young soldier, has it to the little girl before hugging her and whispering.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen the war is said and done I\u2019ll go to Essos to check up on you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cReally?\u201d She puts the knife away and hugs him tightly, \u201cThank you. For everything. I won\u2019t forget. The Forest won\u2019t forget what you have done for my family.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are the Princess that was Promised.\u201d He pulls away and tucks in some hair of hers that was falling out, \u201cWe will meet again\u2026 Now listen, I trust this crew. They promised to keep you safe till you\u2019re in Essos. They gave me their word, they\u2019re allies of your family.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWill I return to Westeros?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI hope so.\u201d He smiles while standing up, \u201cYour kingdom will need you to return after all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTo war\u2026 Then to find my sister.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI hope you find her. Best of luck to you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd to you, your Grace.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The part ways on the dock, she heads to the ship and him to his horse. The Captain greets her by kneeling and she nods for him to stand up. Before she goes onto the ship she looks back to Ned Stark who quickly heads to his horse. They\u2019ve spent so much time with one another to get here. They\u2019ve spoken vaguely about one another\u2019s lives and what the future holds for them but it seems like she knows him so well. He did after betraying Robert for her family, reasons no one has told her. She\u2019s still internally grateful but thinking about what has happened one last time she runs to him. He turns when hearing her little feet running and sees her jump to hug him one last time. He hugs her back as he hears her asks in a whimpering whisper.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you can\u2026 Can you properly barry my parents?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll try, Princess.\u201d He whispers before saying one last thing, \u201cDon\u2019t forget what they stood for, don\u2019t forget who you are.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI won\u2019t, Ned. I won\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><hr><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to arrive, my King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Davos.\u201d Jon stares down at his desk, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Daenerys Targaryen found the lost Princess of the Forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what we\u2019ve seen nothing is truly impossible.\u201d</p><p>Jon Snow thinks while looking over a map below the ship. He\u2019s in his chambers by his desk as he looks at the map. Davos Seaworth was by the door watching him with his hands behind his back. The set out a week ago to meet with this so-called Queen. They have no plans to bend the knee. Only to get fire glass for the war beyond the wall. They know why the Targaryen girl invited them here but it is not why they are coming. His sister was very displeased with him leaving Winterfell but without fire glass, they have no chance. Ever since she came back to Westeros people have begun saying she didn\u2019t only bring back three dragons and the Dothraki but a legend back to life. Emilia Savage. Jon would never tell anyone but the moment he heard these rumors he opened every book he could find about the story his father use to tell. Wondering if it was true, wondering if his father knew that the made-up story he\u2019s always told them was real. Turning to Davos the King of the North asks with an honest expression.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe it? The stories, the legends, what people are saying now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He says while coming into the room more, \u201cI remember my crew members talking about a ship sinking from Robert\u2019s soldiers many years ago during the war. They said there was a Princess on the ship and her body never left it. It was only a story though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read every history date in every book in Winterfell.\u201d Jon says as he starts taking out books from his shelves, \u201cNone of the books talk or even mention The Kingdom of Savages or House Savage. Or even the Princess you talk of. If it isn\u2019t just a bedtime story why isn\u2019t there any proof of them existing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d He sighs while sitting down tiredly, \u201cI\u2019ve heard many stories and most of them I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re real or not. The whole point of a story is to believe in it even if it isn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut listen to me, Davos. If what everyone saying is true\u2026\u201d Jon finds the book he\u2019s looking for and opens it while heading over to the man, \u201cThen Robert killed her family so he could be King instead of her family and instead of admitting that, he lied to the world saying this family, this girl.\u201d He lifts up a child\u2019s book with a picture of a girl turning into a lion it, \u201cIs just a scary bedtime story parents tell. Do you realize how cruel that is? To wipe out an inter family\u2019s history just to be named the real King. The only thing you can read about them is in children\u2019s books and they all are a little different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, which one is the true story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I plan to ask.\u201d Jon sits down next to Davos while flipping through the book and explaining, \u201cI never knew how my father could tell her story so true, it felt like the story about her was real. And it was this whole time. He knew this whole time she was real, that her gift was real. The worst part about all this\u2026 is that it was real but that woman had to pretend her family, her kingdom, her magic wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all we know, the stories could have been more than what it actually was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father words are never less than what they are.\u201d Jon shuts the book and reads the title while mumbling, \u201cI know he told that story as true as he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p></p>",

He had risen from the dead, she transformed into a dragon. He wasn&rsquo;t just another bastard anymore, he was the prince who was promised. She was no longer an outlaw, she was the princess of the forest. When the two finally cross paths they become forever tangled in the lives of one another. History, however, reveals that the prince and the princess&rsquo;s fates have always been connected to each other.</p><p><i>&ldquo;But what is your birth name?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Princess of the Forest.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Ems&hellip; Did you hear us?&rdquo;</p><p>Standing on the rock balcony a woman in forest green stares out to the dragons soaring in the air. She hears people talking behind her but not the words they are saying. The only words she hears are the ones in her head. But what is your birth name? Only a few months ago did Daenerys Targaryen speak those words to her. Everyone believed her to be dead in the sea or just some story, they thought they saw the last of the Savages after the war. Now the world knows she&rsquo;s very much alive and back in her homeland, Westeros, at Dragonstone. Breathing in the old yet familiar air Emilia Savage smiles in raw joy. She never thought she see the day, hell, she never thought she live to see the day. After a moment Daenerys moves to stand beside Emilia before whispering.</p><p>&ldquo;You know&hellip; Conversating in these discussions would be very helpful for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need my input, Danny.&rdquo; Emilia says as she watches the waves crash onto the shore, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just another outlaw in Westeros.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Lady Savage.&rdquo; Tyrion Lannister speaks up from behind them, &ldquo;We all know you&rsquo;re much, much more than another outlaw. What do the Dothraki call you again? Queen&hellip; Princess something&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Goddess of the forest.&rdquo; Emilia answers with a knowing smile, she can just feel the shit eating grin Tyrion is wearing as she points out, &ldquo;The Dothraki aren&rsquo;t the most civilized people though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess not&hellip;&rdquo; He sighs dramatically before saying cockily, &ldquo;But as I recall before you were exiled from Westeros you were known a Princess of the Forest.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s true she&rsquo;s been named a lot of things on the line of Princess of the forest, that was her purest one. For a good minute, she was known as an outlaw and trader to the seven kingdoms. Her mother after spent all her time-saving nature and animals, when she was born they named her a princess of the forest. Her father was a friend and counseled the Targaryen family. Everyone loved her parents and herself, everyone said their name (Savage) fit their character in the best yet worst ways. Just before war broke the Baratheon and Lannister made the people believe they were more demonic than gifted. Once war hit her parents were killed and she was exiled, Robert Baratheon offered good money for her head once king. Rumor spread that she died on her way to Essos but no one could find a body. Baratheon then made their family out to seem like a make-believe story. When she made it to Essos she fought for her freedom for a long time until someone was finally able to chain her in a cave without being able to escape no matter what shape. That was until Danny became Khaleesi for the second time.</p><p>&ldquo;All Tyrion is trying to say is&hellip;&rdquo; Daenerys speaks up in a warm tone besides the woman in forest green, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no longer exiled or an outlaw. You are the Princess of the Forest, embarrass it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running half my life, I&rsquo;ve been in a cage the other half,&rdquo; Emilia lets out a shaky breath as a dragon soars right past her, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take a few more speeches from you and Tyrion to make me embarrass what got me exiled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were exiled by people who fear your family.&rdquo; Lord Varys speaks up, &ldquo;Not of who you are.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;My brother, Visery, told me a story when I was young. About the Kingdom of Savages.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh? So you&rsquo;ve heard that bedtime story.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Remembering the first conversation Emilia had with Daenerys she turns around and looks at everyone in the room. The room was truly filled with misfits, everyone in the room was here from being exiled, banished, or formerly enslaved. Everyone surrounds the table shape map as they stare at Daenerys and Emilia at the balcony. Tyrion stands next to Lord Varys as they wait for the women to speak. Missandei and Grey Worm stand beside one another across the table. Melisandre paces around the table in her red cloak. So many important people who have been pushed aside are here looking to Daenerys and yet Emilia. They were all here for the last Targaryen but Emilia has somehow gained their respect in this past few months. Leaning on a post Emilia speaks up for all to hear.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not royalty anymore, my kingdom is gone, nor am I the titles people have given me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course Lady Savage&hellip;&rdquo; Moving to stand beside Tyrion while looking at the map Daenerys waves a hand and points out, &ldquo;But your family has counseled mine for centuries. So it&rsquo;s only fair I ask for your advice in these critical times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Advice on what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On Jon Snow.&rdquo; Daenerys answers while looking at the woman by the balcony, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s King of the North now. He&rsquo;s Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard, was a Commander of the Knight Watch too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ned Stark?&rdquo; She repeats the name under her breath in disbelief, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t- Who is he to the Seven Kingdoms?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was the Warden of the North, an ally of Robert Baratheon during the rebellion, was also his second hand later on.&rdquo; Lord Varys answers confused on why she&rsquo;s asking, &ldquo;Well, before Robert&rsquo;s son executed him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was beloved by many.&rdquo; Tyrion then adds when seeing the wheels turn in Emilia&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;One of the most honorable, respected, and righteous men I&rsquo;ve known. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I..&rdquo; A million memories flash in her mind before saying with an unreadable expression, &ldquo;I thought you were talking about someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I still need advice on this Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the man&hellip; This is the first I&rsquo;ve heard of him.&rdquo; Emilia walks down to where everyone is standing, &ldquo;But I know a bastard does not become a Commander and a King so easily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say we invite him here.&rdquo; Tyrion speaks up while looking at the women, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an old friend of mine, I trust him. He&rsquo;s one of the most honorable men I&rsquo;ve met. Let&rsquo;s see if he&rsquo;ll bend the knee and become an ally of ours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t bend the knee.&rdquo; The Forest Princess says instantly while looking to the ocean again, &ldquo;Have you ever met a King or Queen bend the knee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did.&rdquo; Melisandre points out while looking around, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m correct.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bend the knee.&rdquo; Emilia spits out while putting on a humorless smile as she stares at the woman in red, &ldquo;I made a deal with Daenerys. Even if I did bend the knee I was no kingdom to call myself a Queen or Princess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean no kingdom?&rdquo; Lord Varys asks very intrigued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the rumors about the Kingdom of Savages. If it&rsquo;s a real Kingdom it just doesn&rsquo;t disappear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When my family died and I vanished there was no one to rule my kingdom.&rdquo; Emilia starts walking toward the bald man, &ldquo;There was no one to find safety for them, no one to help them find food. So they dispersed from one another. My Kingdom was built to help them stay safe from humans and other animals. Without my family the Kingdom is nothing, we held the Kingdom together by being the Kingdom. Animals now look after themselves and only themselves because of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here now.&rdquo; He points out while looking down at the table, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you form our Kingdom once more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not bring a kingdom from the ashes just to have it fall again.&rdquo; Emilia declares while slamming her hands on the table, &ldquo;I will not make them go through that again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They would for you, though.&rdquo; Melisandre speaks up once more knowingly, &ldquo;They sense your presence here already, I can tell. More birds, deer, snakes have crossed my path since I&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know they want to. They&rsquo;ve told me.&rdquo; Emilia sighs while looking at her tiredly, &ldquo;But I do not plan to become a Queen of any kind for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your birthright-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; Daenerys announces while looking at Emilia sympathetically, &ldquo;What she decides to do with her fallen Kingdom is her choice and her choice alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But her family-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would want her to make the decision on her own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a princess. Only in stories. Let&rsquo;s keep it that way.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><i>&ldquo;The Savage Family is in here! Ready your weapons!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Run! Emilia, Run!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, Papa! I won&rsquo;t leave you!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Elizabeth! Get her out of here!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Noooo, Papa!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you my little forest princess.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sobbing Emilia, not a day over 7, gets pulled by her mother toward a servant door in the Castle at King&rsquo;s Landing. She trying to get out of Elizabeth&rsquo;s, her mother&rsquo;s, grasps while yelling for her father. Her mother holds her tightly as she pulls her to the door and slams it open with her back. Pulling her daughter in they see their father and husband, Thomas Savage, smile at them in fear before looking back at the grand doors in front of them and shape into a large size bear. He roars as the guards coming rushing in with swords and spears. Her mother holds her mouth from screaming loudly as they attack her father. He begins chopping their heads clean off and swinging his claws but more and more come. He keeps fighting as they stabbing him until he&rsquo;s laying on the floor in his own blood. Elizabeth quietly shuts the door before running down the narrow hall with her daughter crying in her arms. Today was the first day of Robert Baratheon&rsquo;s rebellion.</i></p><p><i>For weeks now the Savage family knew the lies Baratheon and Lannister were feeding the public. It was only a matter of time until they came for their heads. They only wished they had got their daughter out of the Capital before it happened but here they are. Running and fighting to save Emilia&rsquo;s life, the only life that mattered to them. The Targaryens were also fighting to escape the Capital, they had no clue where they were but they know they&rsquo;re in the same boat as them. Emilia had no clue what was going on, she still thought the people liked her family. Her parents didn&rsquo;t tell her about the rumor and plots against them. She was only now starting to shape into animals and they didn&rsquo;t want her to think it&rsquo;s bad to have that gift. Running down the hall Emilia&rsquo;s mother whispers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be okay. You&rsquo;ll be safe, I promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They killed Pa-pa.&rdquo; She cries into her mother&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;Why? Mother, how could they?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;People do unspeakable things when in fear.&rdquo; She answers in quick breaths, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my princess, I won&rsquo;t let them do anything to you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Her mother turns right and sees a soldier looking around the hall making her run straight. The next door she sees she pulls Emilia in with her. It&rsquo;s a small room for of cleaning mops and brooms. Going to the corner Elizabeth sits down and covers her daughter with her body. Her mother motions for them to stay quiet with her finger before looking at the door they came from. The two of them watch is without making a sound as guards run by. As they listen they hear the soldiers talking to one another.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Robert wants everyone in the Targaryen and Savage family dead.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Viserys and Daenerys already escaped from King&rsquo;s Landing we have a search party for them right now.&rdquo; One of them speaks up tiredly, &ldquo;Everyone else is dead in their family.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And the Savage family?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;All of them but Elizabeth and Emilia.&rdquo; Another answers, &ldquo;But they are still in the castle.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Make sure they don&rsquo;t leave then. Robert wants their heads.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The conversation dies down and the girls hear footsteps walking away. Elizabeth&rsquo;s head lifts up as she listens, her ears turn into wolf ears as she sees if anyone is still out there. Standing up and pulling her daughter hands for her to follow she goes to the door. Listening one last time her ears turn back into her own and looks to Emilia. Mouthing to stay quiet she slowly opens the door and looks around before running to the hall on the left and down to the end. At the end is a wooden door, Elizabeth looks between the cracks and sees a man under as hood. Knowing who it is she opens the door and runs to him with Emilia. Sighing in relief she hugs him tightly before whispering.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thank you, Ned. My family is in your debt.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No need to thank me.&rdquo; He smiles before taking off the hood to show longish ginger hair, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right thing to do, your grace.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Emilia, honey.&rdquo; Kneeling down to her daughter Elizabeth says frantically, &ldquo;This young man is going to help you cross the seas to Essos.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What about you, mother?&rdquo; Emilia asks while looking at her then to the boy, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take to long if we both go right now.&rdquo; She explains while looking around for guards, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you in Essos after everything is said and done.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to leave without you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ned will take good care of you. He&rsquo;s an honorable man.&rdquo; She says while tugging her to his horse, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re on the fastest ship to Essos. He&rsquo;s the only one you can trust, okay? No you know can be trusted besides me and him. Listen to me, don&rsquo;t let anyone know who you are until we&rsquo;re together again.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why does he have the Rebellion&rsquo;s uniform on then?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; She snaps while pulling her onto the horse before Ned does too, &ldquo;What matters is you&rsquo;re going to be Princess that was promised is going to be safe.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you mean the Princess that was promised!&rdquo; Emilia cries wanting to go back into her mother&rsquo;s arms, &ldquo;Mother! What&rsquo;s going on? Come with me! Please!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you everything once we&rsquo;re in Essos. Together.&rdquo; Her mother then starts spilling tears from her own eyes, &ldquo;I love you. Whatever happens, Emilia, don&rsquo;t you forget, you&rsquo;re the Princess of the Forest. No one can take your birthright away from you. Now you have to go-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; A guard shouts from the door they came out of, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re under arrest.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Go! Now! Ned, keep her safe!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I will, I promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Turning toward the soldiers running toward them Elizabeth breaths fire out of her own mouth and burns the first three to ashes. Ned puts on his hood again and rides off, Emilia hold onto him while screaming for her mother. As they reach the edge of the forest Emilia looks back and sees her mother start to shape into a dragon. Before she could completely form a hand full of guards stab her causing her to fall onto the ground. She lays there unmoving, half of her is a human and the other a dragon. Emilia watches as they cut off her head before running toward them into the forest. Shouting to the stranger she&rsquo;s riding with she points to the soldiers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re following us!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose them in the forest, don&rsquo;t worry, Princess.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What if they don&rsquo;t? Can you survive in a forest?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Stark, Princess. Once you&rsquo;ve lived in the North you can live anywhere.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Stark of Winterfell?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes. Eddard Stark at your service, but you may call me Ned.&rdquo;</i></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Danny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come in, your grace.&rdquo;</p><p>She immediately announces when realizing its the rightful era to the throne. Daenerys comes in with her white silky hair in braids, her outfit was shades of black. She looks so different to Emilia from when they were in Essos, then again they both looked different. Emilia wasn&rsquo;t wearing peasant rages anymore, instead, she was dressed in a forest green color dress that clung to her body. Her hair has grown since their first meeting and is now long thick curls that reach her hips. Standing in Emilia&rsquo;s chamber Daenerys look around to find a large blue snake in the center of the bed before announcing.</p><p>&ldquo;A raven has arrived. Tyrion Lannister was right, Jon Snow will be joining us in a few days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hear from the forest that he isn&rsquo;t coming to bend the knee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why would he come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My friends aren&rsquo;t explaining his reasoning clearly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see&hellip; Nonetheless, we will try to convince him to.&rdquo; She nods before turning back to the door and offering, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all having supper in the dining hall if you care to join us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, your grace.&rdquo; Emilia nods with a small smile before adding, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll have to pass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; She opens the door before saying one last thing, &ldquo;I just want to say if you wanted to unite your Kingdom once again&hellip; I fully support it. You would be on my council, I would see your people as one of my own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I appreciate that.&rdquo; The Forest Princess smiles sadly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not built for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ems.&rdquo; Danny laughs lightly as look at her in pure honestly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like me. We were born for it.&rdquo;</p><p>With that said she leaves as fast as she came making Emilia continue to pace in front of her bed. The snake watches the scene in front of it without moving, its tongue then makes a sound that causes Emilia to send an annoyed look it&rsquo;s way. Stopping the sound the snake moves to snuggle closer to itself. It&rsquo;s a long large snake that&rsquo;s dark blue, a very rare species. Emilia&rsquo;s always been able to communicate with animals, all the language seems to be one in her mind but she knows that&rsquo;s because of her blood. All sounds animals make sounds like words to her, however, it was hard understanding them when they don&rsquo;t know all the words possible to say. Standing in front of the rare blue snake she says out loud to it.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t none of you tell me about who Ned really was?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask, your Grace.&rdquo; The Snake speaks up in a smooth light tone accent, &ldquo;We thought you knew he was a Commander of the Rebellion. You&rsquo;re mother did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t tell me that. How could she at the time? She only told me to trust him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was right to.&rdquo; The snake agrees while adding, &ldquo;He only does what is best and most honorable. That&rsquo;s all he knows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They why betray his king for us, for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he knew the real Rebellions intentions. The war was built on a lie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Queen that was Promised. That&rsquo;s why they burnt your kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make sense!&rdquo; She yells while throwing a chair to the wall, &ldquo;Everyone has told me I was the Princess that was Promised! But what the Hell was I Promised?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were promised the lands you stand on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you but that doesn&rsquo;t clear anything up for me.&rdquo; Emilia sighs while falling against the wall to sit down, &ldquo;That still doesn&rsquo;t explain why Ned, the second hand of Baratheon, spared my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will see in time.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><i>&ldquo;This ship will take you across the sea to Essos. You&rsquo;ll be safer over there.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving me?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, I&rsquo;ve been gone for too long.&rdquo; Ned kneels does in front of the Forest Princess, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving you with enough gold to last you a year, Princess.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Ned Stark and Emilia Savage were on a dock in the middle of the night. They both wore hoods to cover their identities. The ship was being boarded with the crew and food as they spoke. The two have been traveling from months to get her here. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, both of them had to hide who they were completely making their trip last longer than it should. Taking out a knife Ned, a young soldier, has it to the little girl before hugging her and whispering.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;When the war is said and done I&rsquo;ll go to Essos to check up on you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; She puts the knife away and hugs him tightly, &ldquo;Thank you. For everything. I won&rsquo;t forget. The Forest won&rsquo;t forget what you have done for my family.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are the Princess that was Promised.&rdquo; He pulls away and tucks in some hair of hers that was falling out, &ldquo;We will meet again&hellip; Now listen, I trust this crew. They promised to keep you safe till you&rsquo;re in Essos. They gave me their word, they&rsquo;re allies of your family.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Will I return to Westeros?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; He smiles while standing up, &ldquo;Your kingdom will need you to return after all.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;To war&hellip; Then to find my sister.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I hope you find her. Best of luck to you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And to you, your Grace.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The part ways on the dock, she heads to the ship and him to his horse. The Captain greets her by kneeling and she nods for him to stand up. Before she goes onto the ship she looks back to Ned Stark who quickly heads to his horse. They&rsquo;ve spent so much time with one another to get here. They&rsquo;ve spoken vaguely about one another&rsquo;s lives and what the future holds for them but it seems like she knows him so well. He did after betraying Robert for her family, reasons no one has told her. She&rsquo;s still internally grateful but thinking about what has happened one last time she runs to him. He turns when hearing her little feet running and sees her jump to hug him one last time. He hugs her back as he hears her asks in a whimpering whisper.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you can&hellip; Can you properly barry my parents?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Princess.&rdquo; He whispers before saying one last thing, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget what they stood for, don&rsquo;t forget who you are.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, Ned. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</i></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to arrive, my King.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Davos.&rdquo; Jon stares down at his desk, &ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That Daenerys Targaryen found the lost Princess of the Forest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After what we&rsquo;ve seen nothing is truly impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon Snow thinks while looking over a map below the ship. He&rsquo;s in his chambers by his desk as he looks at the map. Davos Seaworth was by the door watching him with his hands behind his back. The set out a week ago to meet with this so-called Queen. They have no plans to bend the knee. Only to get fire glass for the war beyond the wall. They know why the Targaryen girl invited them here but it is not why they are coming. His sister was very displeased with him leaving Winterfell but without fire glass, they have no chance. Ever since she came back to Westeros people have begun saying she didn&rsquo;t only bring back three dragons and the Dothraki but a legend back to life. Emilia Savage. Jon would never tell anyone but the moment he heard these rumors he opened every book he could find about the story his father use to tell. Wondering if it was true, wondering if his father knew that the made-up story he&rsquo;s always told them was real. Turning to Davos the King of the North asks with an honest expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you believe it? The stories, the legends, what people are saying now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; He says while coming into the room more, &ldquo;I remember my crew members talking about a ship sinking from Robert&rsquo;s soldiers many years ago during the war. They said there was a Princess on the ship and her body never left it. It was only a story though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read every history date in every book in Winterfell.&rdquo; Jon says as he starts taking out books from his shelves, &ldquo;None of the books talk or even mention The Kingdom of Savages or House Savage. Or even the Princess you talk of. If it isn&rsquo;t just a bedtime story why isn&rsquo;t there any proof of them existing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He sighs while sitting down tiredly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard many stories and most of them I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re real or not. The whole point of a story is to believe in it even if it isn&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But listen to me, Davos. If what everyone saying is true&hellip;&rdquo; Jon finds the book he&rsquo;s looking for and opens it while heading over to the man, &ldquo;Then Robert killed her family so he could be King instead of her family and instead of admitting that, he lied to the world saying this family, this girl.&rdquo; He lifts up a child&rsquo;s book with a picture of a girl turning into a lion it, &ldquo;Is just a scary bedtime story parents tell. Do you realize how cruel that is? To wipe out an inter family&rsquo;s history just to be named the real King. The only thing you can read about them is in children&rsquo;s books and they all are a little different.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, which one is the true story?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I plan to ask.&rdquo; Jon sits down next to Davos while flipping through the book and explaining, &ldquo;I never knew how my father could tell her story so true, it felt like the story about her was real. And it was this whole time. He knew this whole time she was real, that her gift was real. The worst part about all this&hellip; is that it was real but that woman had to pretend her family, her kingdom, her magic wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all we know, the stories could have been more than what it actually was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My father words are never less than what they are.&rdquo; Jon shuts the book and reads the title while mumbling, &ldquo;I know he told that story as true as he could.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.&rdquo;</p></p>",
