If she really would value him as a person she would not tell him to just risk his life. <br/>\nAnd it became only worse. She ignored what RLJ meant to him, making it only about her, showing more abusive behaviour by trying to distance him from friends and family, threatening his family. I think that many people don&rsquo;t see it because of the gender reversed situation, and because people have not processed DarkDany yet.

Therefore the imbalance and the abuse is there but they don&rsquo;t rub it into our face. We have to get it on our own. <br/>\nThis didn&rsquo;t work. People didn&rsquo;t get it on their own. Good story telling means that you have to take the reader and show them - at least occasionally.<br/>\nI can understand that you are immensely frustrated with this. I am as well and I&rsquo;ll never forgive D&amp;D for passing the opportunity to let us really root for the Starks. They underused Kit&rsquo;s acting skill and this is a shame. His microexpressions are so on point, it is painful to watch. Just imagine if we had gotten the opportunity to really see as Jon suffers! I think that they did not further the DarkDany plot in episode 3 was a huge mistake. <br/>\nI really, really hope that we will get Jon&rsquo;s POV in episode 6, finally after 10 (!) episodes with only glimpses&hellip;. I have some hope, especially because I think episode 5 had some really good scenes.

She ignored what RLJ meant to him, making it only about her, showing more abusive behaviour by trying to distance him from friends and family, threatening his family. I think that many people don\u2019t see it because of the gender reversed situation, and because people have not processed DarkDany yet.

She was already strong or she couldn\u2019t have survived Ramsay. This is infuriating, even though there can be no doubt that they did write Sansa /Joffrey and Sansa /Ramsay as abusive. We saw Sansa\u2019s suffering from her POV. <br>\nNevertheless I do think that Jonerys relationship is written like that on purpose and they trusted that the audience would not catch it and only understand in hindsight: They didn\u2019t give us Jon\u2019s POV or only hints of it (while we saw how Sansa suffered from Joffrey and Ramsay), they trust that the audience would not get the abusive vibes as fast as in a gender swapped imbalanced relationship and they trusted that we would so accustomed to see Dany as hero that we simply would not suspect her treating Jon that way.<br>\nI think they wanted DarkDany as a rug pull where you realise some things only in hindsight and they sacrificed everything for this plot twist, most prominently Jon\u2019s POV. Therefore the imbalance and the abuse is there but they don\u2019t rub it into our face. We have to get it on our own. <br>\nThis didn\u2019t work. People didn\u2019t get it on their own. Good story telling means that you have to take the reader and show them - at least occasionally.<br>\nI can understand that you are immensely frustrated with this. I am as well and I\u2019ll never forgive D&amp;D for passing the opportunity to let us really root for the Starks. They underused Kit\u2019s acting skill and this is a shame. His microexpressions are so on point, it is painful to watch. Just imagine if we had gotten the opportunity to really see as Jon suffers! I think that they did not further the DarkDany plot in episode 3 was a huge mistake. <br>\nI really, really hope that we will get Jon\u2019s POV in episode 6, finally after 10 (!) episodes with only glimpses\u2026. I have some hope, especially because I think episode 5 had some really good scenes. The Anti- war statement was surprisingly strong for a fantasy show. <br>\nSo, fingers crossed for tomorrow!<br>\nThanks for the ask!\n<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>(2) \nSansa shamed in the past for trying to survive abusive after abusive \nsituation. The writers saying this season (again) that her abuse and \nrape are what made her stronger. Jon shamed this last couple of episodes\n for trying to survive and abusive relationship? Does he too need to be \nraped? What the hell is wrong with the writers? What the hell is wrong \nwith the audience? Sorry but these past two weeks of GoT have been a \nride in Space Mountain whithout stoping. <br /></p><p>(3) \nIn the span of only two episodes we have seen a Jon Snow trully happy in\n the victory celebration to the defeated man of KL burning.But heis \ndumb, he knows nothing, he is a cunt, he is a whiny broken record.

        "body": "<p>tl;dr: daenerys&rsquo; tale could have also been used to say fuck white supremacy and fuck the patriarchy in the same way it is used to say fuck slavery, but instead we prioritsed jon&rsquo;s narrative as a tragic hero who paves the way for others and responds to threats when they arise without actually allowing him to engage in the world he had a hand in forging. daenerys, who does have a hand in it, has her sanity and rational mind taken from her so that she is incapable of ushering in any semblance of change. this is done to her specifically in the aftermath of as much pain as she could really possibly have given to her, with the loss of children, close friends, advisors, and a lover..instead of letting her grieve she&rsquo;s bonkers. it&rsquo;s&hellip;boring.</p>\n\n<p><br/>\nSo Daenerys&rsquo; &ldquo;I have no love here&rdquo;&hellip; Yeah. Pretty true by her accounts. To daenerys, she is used to people seeing her wonder, this mother who brought back mystical, magical life back into being&hellip;her children are young, sweet, you see the majesty of her cute little baby dragons. That she goes on a narrative of being a white saviour as her means of growing power is troubling enough (white male writer thinks this is a way to build character..) yet exists in tandem with what could have been a great story to tell.</p>\n\n<p>This woman&rsquo;s forces are foreigners by definition but also the &ldquo;foreigner&rdquo; of being a brown person to the white people of king&rsquo;s landing and westeros as a whole&hellip; These westerosi people also are the people who only see her children in their grown forms, as inherently terrifying. We see her children return to her as a mother and protect her and even comfort her, we hear the companionable but lamenting chirp for a mother in mourning and a heavy cry for the loss of  a brother, but these ppl just hear a warcry in kl and Winterfell it&rsquo;s just as existing (also just like reminder the northerners are hella racist, and while Robb&rsquo;s decision was stupid his wife\u2019s (talia? Can\u2019t remember lol) also treated with such vitriolic distaste..hm&hellip;. like they just hate brown ppl poor dothraki unsullied missandei..god). Her dragons are so frightening to someone who doesn&rsquo;t see them as having personhood ..but they are her children truly. </p>\n\n<p>So say daenerys does all she does up until .. The Bell.. And then she just perches. She settles down. She can enter the damn keep herself, with her dragon allowing her to guide his actions (she&rsquo;s first of all a badass!! I&rsquo;m cheated! She commands power so let\u2019s recognise that!) and the ppl see this. He is visually frightening to them and yet entirely harmless in this moment cause he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;what I&rsquo;m fighting for my mom like&hellip;I ain&rsquo;t gonna ruin her day cause she taught me better than that !!&rdquo; not to say that dragon = brown person (if im giving that impression im failing terribly), but that dragon = soldier with a brain also, and being capable of fighting =/= monster. There are white westerosi soldiers on this battlefield as well as dany\u2019s forces and context is what drives ppl\u2019s opinions of them. </p>\n\n<p>Like the ppl are whack and you could&rsquo;ve had a cool DRAGON CONSCIOUSNESS SUBPLOT CAUSE DRAGON and also been willing to say these people are fucking racist dude, not cause of the dragons obviously but because daenerys controls the forces under her first of all but primarily that uhhhh they don&rsquo;t fucking act that way to begin with?? but like nah&hellip; Instead we see &ldquo;the extinction of the dothraki people basically&rdquo; but then suddenly it&rsquo;s&hellip;half? so they come back from the dead just to mob king\u2019s landing\u2026prove the racist and xenophobic westerosi right\u2026\u2026\u2026..cool. what could begin the peoples&rsquo; change of opinions regarding the barbarism of the dothraki, unsullied, and dragons is a ceasing of hostilities upon assured victory&hellip;but instead&hellip;we have&hellip;FiRe AnD bLoOd</p>\n\n<p>(When honest she didn&rsquo;t need a single one of them ANYWAY?! fleet? Her, scorpions? Her&hellip; At this point she wins because literally no foot soldier can kill a DRAGON LITERAL DRAGON ..the gate then, her again, coming into play as she can literally hang out, wait for Jon to back her up w his forces cause sometimes a story where heroes are triumphant and get to feel it are good ones&hellip;) </p>\n\n<p>Anyway this is to say that her narrative could have been taken in a direction that showed her to be a true revolutionary in a world full of bigots and you could have directly said these people&rsquo;s xenophobia and colourism and racism and, for that matter misogyny, is as was to the slavers she previously conquered and destroyed. You could have allowed this to be told in your story first off but with a woman to boot but nah the better story is saying fuck that it&rsquo;s unfair to let Jon not be the undisputed hero (and I love him) but cooler for him to kill that woman who actually goes crazy (cause SHE&rsquo;S just like her father, but while Jon suffers the same treatment he is conveniently spared having to choose because in the end they&rsquo;re both so Noble and honourable of men) and defies and defiles everything she has ever stood for in just moments because she cannot be trusted with this raw power (she who CAGED this power and who this power respects) while in the AFTERMATH of losing virtually everything she has in this life barring her chase for the security of the throne (as there has to be a reason for what&rsquo;s happened to her people there&rsquo;s no going back) you don&rsquo;t let her receive comfort from her partner, at this point just flat out one of the last people left ALIVE that cares for her which is what is understandably getting to her, that those she loves are all dying and NOT about Jon and him rejecting her love eye roll! </p>\n\n<p>But so you don&rsquo;t let him comfort her, though his heroism is justified by his care for people and his desire for tenderness&hellip;him&hellip;this guy, THE &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; (no one says mad about that ten year old he hanged!) isn&rsquo;t gonna comfort the woman he loves????? And how&rsquo;s that better&hellip;. This narrative of &ldquo;in the end the woman we propped up, we just did it to make it a real point that her power didn&rsquo;t matter when it came head to head with a man&rsquo;s rejection&hellip; She&rsquo;ll lose every time! Ha ha she&rsquo;s crazy for losing everything we made her lose in the most absurd of fashions!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>&gt;&gt;(A WIGHT hunt? For CERSEI?? her odds were always going to be best by NOT participating because&hellip;Dany&hellip;has.. DRAGONS! then daenerys KIND OF FORGOT?! And couldn&rsquo;t SEE? And couldn&rsquo;t expect an ambush to her left behind ancestral home DIRECTLY after SHE did it to CERSEI <i>LANNISTER</i> even though it ended up or perhaps specifically BECAUSE it was a tactical blunder in the end, SHE DOESN&rsquo;T EXPECT THIS FROM CERSEI?! ( aside from like..it being OBVIOUS ANYWAY?) not like Jon JUST WON HIS BACK ALSO AND THEY&rsquo;RE STANDING IN IT when they talk about THAT FLEET SHE FORGOT???!?!?!!  I&rsquo;m heated at the stupidity lol I&rsquo;m sorry but anyway WHAT. </p>\n\n<p>She loses both her dragons for an absurd reason, which coincidentally both happen to be rooted in trusting Cersei, or accepting Tyrion&rsquo;s interpretation of her&hellip; He&rsquo;s convinced she cares about casterly rock first of all doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d go for high garden second of all after damn well knowing not only was the crown in debt (MASTER OF COIN? HAND?) but also knowing the Lannisters weren&rsquo;t in the position to fund two regimes at this point in comparison to the potential tyrells, and he also doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d consider taking their shit?? wouldn&rsquo;t tywin, and then the obvious like&hellip; Really thinking she&rsquo;d be convinced by the wight? Why would cersei care? It would take all of them for it, the long night, to get to her&hellip; She knows these fucking dragons mean business which you do show with all the scorpions but you don&rsquo;t allow her the political fore thought to be like yeah I can&rsquo;t take that already so either these guys win and hopefully suffer losses or they lose and we lose anyways&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Tyrion is like yeah but haha she&rsquo;ll care about the lives and stuff then like dude are you out of touch, if he&rsquo;d had eyes on that Shame walk he&rsquo;d know that just isn&rsquo;t it (also why does no one literally no one talk about her blowing up the sept)&hellip;it&rsquo;s her power not who gives her the power (which is why Dany is the one who should win because for her it is the opposite but then&hellip; You made it be about the power. Fuck being mhysa, all that matters is what happens when a woman LOSES that child (both these women are plagued by this) and also women can&rsquo;t actually rule bye) so because Cersei doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck about anything but her position in the red keep, which I would accept as her only location much better if you at least gave her a story here, so she will of course stay there and keep her forces there and fuck these people anyway, the best way for me to win is to let the other side die as much as possible (and this is especially true after Jon says publicly that he supports daenerys so it&rsquo;s DONE like at that moment it&rsquo;s sealed regardless because to her it is now fair game to be political and for her she&rsquo;s right) <br/>\n&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Tangent aside. So Daenerys can have a satisfying end in multiple ways here, and both can recognise the fuckery of the ppl of westeros (which you can ofc also say of how the ww threat is about us killing one another as told with climate change beside it) either she can actually say fuck it I&rsquo;m going back to essos with my people where we will build our ideal together in a world that doesn&rsquo;t hate us and we thrive or she can just as well stick around and demand these people bend to the world she will usher forth IDEOLOGICALLY (though they assume force and are proven wrong) but she doesn&rsquo;t demand her people turn to westerosi culture but says hey westerosi culture is shit if this is what you are saying you&rsquo;re all about so it can make room for more and I will defend it (as well as all good loving people, as she is fucking mother to all like come on this is actually a form of the story I&rsquo;ll take when it&rsquo;s about motherhood?!?!)&hellip;<br/><br/>\nHer power remains in tact, earned through her empathy (even explicitly her motherhood and she loves it!!) as well as her wit and her tact&hellip;. She has played a different game than Sansa but a game nonetheless, one of motherhood and not daughterhood, but goddamn it she did it and she CRUSHED IT and she&rsquo;s the MOTHER OF DRAGONS and you REALLY won&rsquo;t reward her?! You instead think really it&rsquo;s better to say &quot;fuck your power, that exists as a celebration of your femininity that you have been able to weaponise for yourself when needed and celebrate without shame otherwise, that you have managed to back up with tangible physical demonstrations of your power via armies and dragons..first you lose your children, but they&rsquo;re also the literal foundation of your power militarily speaking, so fuck the motherhood drive, you lose the man you love (because we&rsquo;ve decided now is the time to have a character injected with this morality, to spite her..) and in a way that has him not just exerting his power over her but him like leeching hers away by just virtue of existing in her space, you take away her armies as well and reduce them from dedicated followers of a woman that inspires them (like oh idk how Jon&rsquo;s men follow him&hellip;) and turn them into foreign brown screaming pillaging invaders.. </p>\n\n<p>Fuck your power as a woman, you&rsquo;re going to lose it to a man, because you feel grief and anger simultaneously and have been moved to hysterics, he will have the audacity to not even want this power so freely given to him, he will love you until it is your lowest moment after your greatest show of your power in its rawest and most heroic moment, that moment will somehow belong to him in this world where he gets to exist in the mere presence of your power and be thanked for it&hellip; And just as an extra fuck you, your power is going to be stripped from you by the act of love and in trusting men, because we are nothing but the pain you give us&hellip; (Little birds no longer for the grace of our abusers, we fall in love with them and trust them and in the end we are actually most right about our abusers when we justify their actions give them weight in our lives act like they had something to do with our growth and that it&rsquo;s made us who we are it can&rsquo;t be all that bad..)&rdquo; Like. What the fuck?</p>\n\n<p>You give us a story where in the end the woman loses her sense of Justice &ndash; she takes it too far when she had so much raw power because SHE is hysterical, meanwhile men (Jon) are rewarded for not wanting the power&hellip; By giving them power.. God forbid she have ambition though she&rsquo;s proven herself capable and worthy of it while Jon is a Commander, a leader of soldiers not a ruler, and didn&rsquo;t Varys have shit to say about that with Robert?! But he sees a grieving woman and suddenly she&rsquo;s mad&hellip;. She&rsquo;s isolating herself because of course she is, one she&rsquo;s a queen two she now ACTUALLY has a right to worry those closest to her are plotting against her yet again to take her power or her life or both (and they are), and then when the one person who is able to comfort her has for some reason decided now he suddenly cannot do so, she crumbles into dust. She goes berserk with her power&hellip;so she is no longer worthy of it&hellip; So the man, her love and partner, and the noblest bestest warrior in the continent, must put her down for it&hellip; Which makes him worthy or her power, which is acceptably his for the taking because conveniently he&rsquo;s actually the true heir&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>A much better story involves Jon accepting her power, respecting her for it as is one of the justifications for his love for her, and oh idk&hellip; Being cool with being second in command? Like as a ruler?? Cause he&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t a ruler and doesn&rsquo;t want it so of course he would be okay with this? And having to destroy her will destroy him and it&rsquo;ll be told as some reasonable response for why this thus far incredible hero of ours, who we have to be okay with killing our heroine over, who we have all clamoured to have on the throne himself accepting this power he&rsquo;s &ldquo;earned&rdquo; by being born (but only with the right paperwork) because he had demonstrated to us he is worthy of it because he is so heroic&hellip; Why he just leaves it behind, because he can&rsquo;t be true to himself as a sensitive man who didn&rsquo;t want any of this (responsibility) in the first place, if he sits in the throne after killing the woman he loves, who he knows was right for it&hellip; </p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;ll kill her that we&rsquo;re like damn I guess I have to feel bad so he can&rsquo;t use this power of his, but then WHY DID DAENERYS DIE? Why when there is no hero left, no cause for change? Sansa IS the system. Bran is outside of the system. Arya rejects the system, but that\u2019s her story, of internal harmony, not being a revolutionary but of guiding others to internal harmony too&hellip; What&rsquo;s the fucking point like&hellip; &ldquo;Dude ends up sad after saying, man I really didn&rsquo;t want that power/privilege ANYWAY so WHY did I have to kill the love of my life who wanted that power, had earned that power, and who I trusted to wield that power, just to prove it to you!!&rdquo;?? &ldquo;Woman no longer has principals after a man she loves isn&rsquo;t there for her in her time of need, inevitably you will become your terrible father your abuse is justified you could have grown from it (embraced it like Sansa) but you wanted to rise above it and destroy those who would try again so you&rsquo;re the one with the unhappy ending fuck you&rdquo; a plot device in her own story, a motivation for Jon&rsquo;s pain and suffering (cause ya know, he&rsquo;s the victim and that&rsquo;s true victimhood)&hellip;. pointless. </p>\n\n<p>at least this bs inspired me and motivated my true desire yet again&hellip;to shit on male media. it&rsquo;s so bad. you have such a desire for &ldquo;being subversive/unexpected&rdquo; and y'all think that grimdark fits that bill great like it&rsquo;s subversive so pair up all this garbage into really shit stories where pain is all there is and it makes you strong or some shit but for women that&rsquo;s only true if it&rsquo;s in the form of being raped, or being rejected by a man in some way, or not having a father figure, because it is all about goddamn dudes and Ugh y'all so boring!!!

I sure am glad that the author is dead and once you&rsquo;ve monetised your worlds and characters they\u2019re ours to mold and take in the RIGHT directions. Because that&rsquo;s stupid and I&rsquo;m sick of getting it with every new &ldquo;innovative, ground breaking, fucking insane incredible and super big balls impressive&rdquo; story a white guy comes up with</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m just saying y'all out her acting like the true evil is Daenerys caring that she lost people and has no support system, that she was pushed to the edge and considers crossing a line, that she can&rsquo;t let go in the immediate aftermath of trauma, instead of that the system is twofold disgusting and vile, top to bottom xenophobia and misogyny are rampant, and the top exploit the bottom (so of course their recourse is to support the conflict of all their &ldquo;lowers&rdquo; by right of existing as different people)&hellip;.you&rsquo;re saying the important takeaway is, women in power are dangerous because they&rsquo;re emotional&hellip;not that their emotions empower them&hellip;boring. </p>\n\n<p>I long for the days of a massively scaled world experience of entertainment like this series has become, ubiquitous in people&rsquo;s lives as a part of culture, that actually tells the right stories. That prioritises a narrative of change but faith to its characters instead of &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; leading to the ultimate gotcha: women don&rsquo;t matter. Like snooze fest 3000. Don&rsquo;t need the social change angle in every story I consume but I sure need you to justify why a series predicated on it, that roots its heroes&rsquo; ultimate heroism strength and power through their ability to enact social change, if this is idealistic and driven by a desire for change or through force of will and proving ability, why does this series abandon the tale and destroy the big pillar of change for &ldquo;shock&rdquo; (manpain) &hellip;.women hating really is a way of life for some people huh. can&rsquo;t relate</p>",
        "reblog": {
            "comment": "<p>tl;dr: daenerys\u2019 tale could have also been used to say fuck white supremacy and fuck the patriarchy in the same way it is used to say fuck slavery, but instead we prioritsed jon\u2019s narrative as a tragic hero who paves the way for others and responds to threats when they arise without actually allowing him to engage in the world he had a hand in forging. daenerys, who does have a hand in it, has her sanity and rational mind taken from her so that she is incapable of ushering in any semblance of change. this is done to her specifically in the aftermath of as much pain as she could really possibly have given to her, with the loss of children, close friends, advisors, and a lover..instead of letting her grieve she\u2019s bonkers. it\u2019s\u2026boring.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nSo Daenerys\u2019 \u201cI have no love here\u201d\u2026 Yeah. Pretty true by her accounts. To daenerys, she is used to people seeing her wonder, this mother who brought back mystical, magical life back into being\u2026her children are young, sweet, you see the majesty of her cute little baby dragons. That she goes on a narrative of being a white saviour as her means of growing power is troubling enough (white male writer thinks this is a way to build character..) yet exists in tandem with what could have been a great story to tell.</p>\n\n<p>This woman\u2019s forces are foreigners by definition but also the \u201cforeigner\u201d of being a brown person to the white people of king\u2019s landing and westeros as a whole\u2026 These westerosi people also are the people who only see her children in their grown forms, as inherently terrifying. We see her children return to her as a mother and protect her and even comfort her, we hear the companionable but lamenting chirp for a mother in mourning and a heavy cry for the loss of  a brother, but these ppl just hear a warcry in kl and Winterfell it\u2019s just as existing (also just like reminder the northerners are hella racist, and while Robb\u2019s decision was stupid his wife\u2019s (talia? Can\u2019t remember lol) also treated with such vitriolic distaste..hm\u2026. like they just hate brown ppl poor dothraki unsullied missandei..god). Her dragons are so frightening to someone who doesn\u2019t see them as having personhood ..but they are her children truly. </p>\n\n<p>So say daenerys does all she does up until .. The Bell.. And then she just perches. She settles down. She can enter the damn keep herself, with her dragon allowing her to guide his actions (she\u2019s first of all a badass!! I\u2019m cheated! She commands power so let\u2019s recognise that!) and the ppl see this. He is visually frightening to them and yet entirely harmless in this moment cause he\u2019s like \u201cwhat I\u2019m fighting for my mom like\u2026I ain\u2019t gonna ruin her day cause she taught me better than that !!\u201d not to say that dragon = brown person (if im giving that impression im failing terribly), but that dragon = soldier with a brain also, and being capable of fighting =/= monster. There are white westerosi soldiers on this battlefield as well as dany\u2019s forces and context is what drives ppl\u2019s opinions of them. </p>\n\n<p>Like the ppl are whack and you could\u2019ve had a cool DRAGON CONSCIOUSNESS SUBPLOT CAUSE DRAGON and also been willing to say these people are fucking racist dude, not cause of the dragons obviously but because daenerys controls the forces under her first of all but primarily that uhhhh they don\u2019t fucking act that way to begin with?? but like nah\u2026 Instead we see \u201cthe extinction of the dothraki people basically\u201d but then suddenly it\u2019s\u2026half? so they come back from the dead just to mob king\u2019s landing\u2026prove the racist and xenophobic westerosi right\u2026\u2026\u2026..cool. what could begin the peoples\u2019 change of opinions regarding the barbarism of the dothraki, unsullied, and dragons is a ceasing of hostilities upon assured victory\u2026but instead\u2026we have\u2026FiRe AnD bLoOd</p>\n\n<p>(When honest she didn\u2019t need a single one of them ANYWAY?! fleet? Her, scorpions? Her\u2026 At this point she wins because literally no foot soldier can kill a DRAGON LITERAL DRAGON ..the gate then, her again, coming into play as she can literally hang out, wait for Jon to back her up w his forces cause sometimes a story where heroes are triumphant and get to feel it are good ones\u2026) </p>\n\n<p>Anyway this is to say that her narrative could have been taken in a direction that showed her to be a true revolutionary in a world full of bigots and you could have directly said these people\u2019s xenophobia and colourism and racism and, for that matter misogyny, is as was to the slavers she previously conquered and destroyed. You could have allowed this to be told in your story first off but with a woman to boot but nah the better story is saying fuck that it\u2019s unfair to let Jon not be the undisputed hero (and I love him) but cooler for him to kill that woman who actually goes crazy (cause SHE\u2019S just like her father, but while Jon suffers the same treatment he is conveniently spared having to choose because in the end they\u2019re both so Noble and honourable of men) and defies and defiles everything she has ever stood for in just moments because she cannot be trusted with this raw power (she who CAGED this power and who this power respects) while in the AFTERMATH of losing virtually everything she has in this life barring her chase for the security of the throne (as there has to be a reason for what\u2019s happened to her people there\u2019s no going back) you don\u2019t let her receive comfort from her partner, at this point just flat out one of the last people left ALIVE that cares for her which is what is understandably getting to her, that those she loves are all dying and NOT about Jon and him rejecting her love eye roll! </p>\n\n<p>But so you don\u2019t let him comfort her, though his heroism is justified by his care for people and his desire for tenderness\u2026him\u2026this guy, THE \u201cgood guy\u201d (no one says mad about that ten year old he hanged!) isn\u2019t gonna comfort the woman he loves????? And how\u2019s that better\u2026. This narrative of \u201cin the end the woman we propped up, we just did it to make it a real point that her power didn\u2019t matter when it came head to head with a man\u2019s rejection\u2026 She\u2019ll lose every time! Ha ha she\u2019s crazy for losing everything we made her lose in the most absurd of fashions!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>&gt;&gt;(A WIGHT hunt? For CERSEI?? her odds were always going to be best by NOT participating because\u2026Dany\u2026has.. DRAGONS! then daenerys KIND OF FORGOT?! And couldn\u2019t SEE? And couldn\u2019t expect an ambush to her left behind ancestral home DIRECTLY after SHE did it to CERSEI <i>LANNISTER</i> even though it ended up or perhaps specifically BECAUSE it was a tactical blunder in the end, SHE DOESN\u2019T EXPECT THIS FROM CERSEI?! ( aside from like..it being OBVIOUS ANYWAY?) not like Jon JUST WON HIS BACK ALSO AND THEY\u2019RE STANDING IN IT when they talk about THAT FLEET SHE FORGOT???!?!?!!  I\u2019m heated at the stupidity lol I\u2019m sorry but anyway WHAT. </p>\n\n<p>She loses both her dragons for an absurd reason, which coincidentally both happen to be rooted in trusting Cersei, or accepting Tyrion\u2019s interpretation of her\u2026 He\u2019s convinced she cares about casterly rock first of all doesn\u2019t think she\u2019d go for high garden second of all after damn well knowing not only was the crown in debt (MASTER OF COIN? HAND?) but also knowing the Lannisters weren\u2019t in the position to fund two regimes at this point in comparison to the potential tyrells, and he also doesn\u2019t think she\u2019d consider taking their shit?? wouldn\u2019t tywin, and then the obvious like\u2026 Really thinking she\u2019d be convinced by the wight? Why would cersei care? It would take all of them for it, the long night, to get to her\u2026 She knows these fucking dragons mean business which you do show with all the scorpions but you don\u2019t allow her the political fore thought to be like yeah I can\u2019t take that already so either these guys win and hopefully suffer losses or they lose and we lose anyways\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Tyrion is like yeah but haha she\u2019ll care about the lives and stuff then like dude are you out of touch, if he\u2019d had eyes on that Shame walk he\u2019d know that just isn\u2019t it (also why does no one literally no one talk about her blowing up the sept)\u2026it\u2019s her power not who gives her the power (which is why Dany is the one who should win because for her it is the opposite but then\u2026 You made it be about the power. Fuck being mhysa, all that matters is what happens when a woman LOSES that child (both these women are plagued by this) and also women can\u2019t actually rule bye) so because Cersei doesn\u2019t give a fuck about anything but her position in the red keep, which I would accept as her only location much better if you at least gave her a story here, so she will of course stay there and keep her forces there and fuck these people anyway, the best way for me to win is to let the other side die as much as possible (and this is especially true after Jon says publicly that he supports daenerys so it\u2019s DONE like at that moment it\u2019s sealed regardless because to her it is now fair game to be political and for her she\u2019s right) <br>\n&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Tangent aside. So Daenerys can have a satisfying end in multiple ways here, and both can recognise the fuckery of the ppl of westeros (which you can ofc also say of how the ww threat is about us killing one another as told with climate change beside it) either she can actually say fuck it I\u2019m going back to essos with my people where we will build our ideal together in a world that doesn\u2019t hate us and we thrive or she can just as well stick around and demand these people bend to the world she will usher forth IDEOLOGICALLY (though they assume force and are proven wrong) but she doesn\u2019t demand her people turn to westerosi culture but says hey westerosi culture is shit if this is what you are saying you\u2019re all about so it can make room for more and I will defend it (as well as all good loving people, as she is fucking mother to all like come on this is actually a form of the story I\u2019ll take when it\u2019s about motherhood?!?!)\u2026<br><br>\nHer power remains in tact, earned through her empathy (even explicitly her motherhood and she loves it!!) as well as her wit and her tact\u2026. She has played a different game than Sansa but a game nonetheless, one of motherhood and not daughterhood, but goddamn it she did it and she CRUSHED IT and she\u2019s the MOTHER OF DRAGONS and you REALLY won\u2019t reward her?! You instead think really it\u2019s better to say \"fuck your power, that exists as a celebration of your femininity that you have been able to weaponise for yourself when needed and celebrate without shame otherwise, that you have managed to back up with tangible physical demonstrations of your power via armies and dragons..first you lose your children, but they\u2019re also the literal foundation of your power militarily speaking, so fuck the motherhood drive, you lose the man you love (because we\u2019ve decided now is the time to have a character injected with this morality, to spite her..) and in a way that has him not just exerting his power over her but him like leeching hers away by just virtue of existing in her space, you take away her armies as well and reduce them from dedicated followers of a woman that inspires them (like oh idk how Jon\u2019s men follow him\u2026) and turn them into foreign brown screaming pillaging invaders.. </p>\n\n<p>Fuck your power as a woman, you\u2019re going to lose it to a man, because you feel grief and anger simultaneously and have been moved to hysterics, he will have the audacity to not even want this power so freely given to him, he will love you until it is your lowest moment after your greatest show of your power in its rawest and most heroic moment, that moment will somehow belong to him in this world where he gets to exist in the mere presence of your power and be thanked for it\u2026 And just as an extra fuck you, your power is going to be stripped from you by the act of love and in trusting men, because we are nothing but the pain you give us\u2026 (Little birds no longer for the grace of our abusers, we fall in love with them and trust them and in the end we are actually most right about our abusers when we justify their actions give them weight in our lives act like they had something to do with our growth and that it\u2019s made us who we are it can\u2019t be all that bad..)\u201d Like. What the fuck?</p>\n\n<p>You give us a story where in the end the woman loses her sense of Justice \u2013 she takes it too far when she had so much raw power because SHE is hysterical, meanwhile men (Jon) are rewarded for not wanting the power\u2026 By giving them power.. God forbid she have ambition though she\u2019s proven herself capable and worthy of it while Jon is a Commander, a leader of soldiers not a ruler, and didn\u2019t Varys have shit to say about that with Robert?! But he sees a grieving woman and suddenly she\u2019s mad\u2026. She\u2019s isolating herself because of course she is, one she\u2019s a queen two she now ACTUALLY has a right to worry those closest to her are plotting against her yet again to take her power or her life or both (and they are), and then when the one person who is able to comfort her has for some reason decided now he suddenly cannot do so, she crumbles into dust.

Pretty true by her accounts. To daenerys, she is used to people seeing her wonder, this mother who brought back mystical, magical life back into being\u2026her children are young, sweet, you see the majesty of her cute little baby dragons. That she goes on a narrative of being a white saviour as her means of growing power is troubling enough (white male writer thinks this is a way to build character..) yet exists in tandem with what could have been a great story to tell.</p>\n\n<p>This woman\u2019s forces are foreigners by definition but also the \u201cforeigner\u201d of being a brown person to the white people of king\u2019s landing and westeros as a whole\u2026 These westerosi people also are the people who only see her children in their grown forms, as inherently terrifying. We see her children return to her as a mother and protect her and even comfort her, we hear the companionable but lamenting chirp for a mother in mourning and a heavy cry for the loss of  a brother, but these ppl just hear a warcry in kl and Winterfell it\u2019s just as existing (also just like reminder the northerners are hella racist, and while Robb\u2019s decision was stupid his wife\u2019s (talia? Can\u2019t remember lol) also treated with such vitriolic distaste..hm\u2026. like they just hate brown ppl poor dothraki unsullied missandei..god). Her dragons are so frightening to someone who doesn\u2019t see them as having personhood ..but they are her children truly. </p>\n\n<p>So say daenerys does all she does up until .. The Bell.. And then she just perches. She settles down. She can enter the damn keep herself, with her dragon allowing her to guide his actions (she\u2019s first of all a badass!! I\u2019m cheated! She commands power so let\u2019s recognise that!) and the ppl see this. He is visually frightening to them and yet entirely harmless in this moment cause he\u2019s like \u201cwhat I\u2019m fighting for my mom like\u2026I ain\u2019t gonna ruin her day cause she taught me better than that !!\u201d not to say that dragon = brown person (if im giving that impression im failing terribly), but that dragon = soldier with a brain also, and being capable of fighting =/= monster. There are white westerosi soldiers on this battlefield as well as dany\u2019s forces and context is what drives ppl\u2019s opinions of them. </p>\n\n<p>Like the ppl are whack and you could\u2019ve had a cool DRAGON CONSCIOUSNESS SUBPLOT CAUSE DRAGON and also been willing to say these people are fucking racist dude, not cause of the dragons obviously but because daenerys controls the forces under her first of all but primarily that uhhhh they don\u2019t fucking act that way to begin with?? but like nah\u2026 Instead we see \u201cthe extinction of the dothraki people basically\u201d but then suddenly it\u2019s\u2026half? so they come back from the dead just to mob king\u2019s landing\u2026prove the racist and xenophobic westerosi right\u2026\u2026\u2026..cool. what could begin the peoples\u2019 change of opinions regarding the barbarism of the dothraki, unsullied, and dragons is a ceasing of hostilities upon assured victory\u2026but instead\u2026we have\u2026FiRe AnD bLoOd</p>\n\n<p>(When honest she didn\u2019t need a single one of them ANYWAY?! fleet? Her, scorpions? Her\u2026 At this point she wins because literally no foot soldier can kill a DRAGON LITERAL DRAGON ..the gate then, her again, coming into play as she can literally hang out, wait for Jon to back her up w his forces cause sometimes a story where heroes are triumphant and get to feel it are good ones\u2026) </p>\n\n<p>Anyway this is to say that her narrative could have been taken in a direction that showed her to be a true revolutionary in a world full of bigots and you could have directly said these people\u2019s xenophobia and colourism and racism and, for that matter misogyny, is as was to the slavers she previously conquered and destroyed. You could have allowed this to be told in your story first off but with a woman to boot but nah the better story is saying fuck that it\u2019s unfair to let Jon not be the undisputed hero (and I love him) but cooler for him to kill that woman who actually goes crazy (cause SHE\u2019S just like her father, but while Jon suffers the same treatment he is conveniently spared having to choose because in the end they\u2019re both so Noble and honourable of men) and defies and defiles everything she has ever stood for in just moments because she cannot be trusted with this raw power (she who CAGED this power and who this power respects) while in the AFTERMATH of losing virtually everything she has in this life barring her chase for the security of the throne (as there has to be a reason for what\u2019s happened to her people there\u2019s no going back) you don\u2019t let her receive comfort from her partner, at this point just flat out one of the last people left ALIVE that cares for her which is what is understandably getting to her, that those she loves are all dying and NOT about Jon and him rejecting her love eye roll! </p>\n\n<p>But so you don\u2019t let him comfort her, though his heroism is justified by his care for people and his desire for tenderness\u2026him\u2026this guy, THE \u201cgood guy\u201d (no one says mad about that ten year old he hanged!) isn\u2019t gonna comfort the woman he loves????? And how\u2019s that better\u2026. This narrative of \u201cin the end the woman we propped up, we just did it to make it a real point that her power didn\u2019t matter when it came head to head with a man\u2019s rejection\u2026 She\u2019ll lose every time! Ha ha she\u2019s crazy for losing everything we made her lose in the most absurd of fashions!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>&gt;&gt;(A WIGHT hunt? For CERSEI?? her odds were always going to be best by NOT participating because\u2026Dany\u2026has.. DRAGONS! then daenerys KIND OF FORGOT?! And couldn\u2019t SEE? And couldn\u2019t expect an ambush to her left behind ancestral home DIRECTLY after SHE did it to CERSEI <i>LANNISTER</i> even though it ended up or perhaps specifically BECAUSE it was a tactical blunder in the end, SHE DOESN\u2019T EXPECT THIS FROM CERSEI?! ( aside from like..it being OBVIOUS ANYWAY?) not like Jon JUST WON HIS BACK ALSO AND THEY\u2019RE STANDING IN IT when they talk about THAT FLEET SHE FORGOT???!?!?!!  I\u2019m heated at the stupidity lol I\u2019m sorry but anyway WHAT. </p>\n\n<p>She loses both her dragons for an absurd reason, which coincidentally both happen to be rooted in trusting Cersei, or accepting Tyrion\u2019s interpretation of her\u2026 He\u2019s convinced she cares about casterly rock first of all doesn\u2019t think she\u2019d go for high garden second of all after damn well knowing not only was the crown in debt (MASTER OF COIN? HAND?) but also knowing the Lannisters weren\u2019t in the position to fund two regimes at this point in comparison to the potential tyrells, and he also doesn\u2019t think she\u2019d consider taking their shit?? wouldn\u2019t tywin, and then the obvious like\u2026 Really thinking she\u2019d be convinced by the wight? Why would cersei care? It would take all of them for it, the long night, to get to her\u2026 She knows these fucking dragons mean business which you do show with all the scorpions but you don\u2019t allow her the political fore thought to be like yeah I can\u2019t take that already so either these guys win and hopefully suffer losses or they lose and we lose anyways\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Tyrion is like yeah but haha she\u2019ll care about the lives and stuff then like dude are you out of touch, if he\u2019d had eyes on that Shame walk he\u2019d know that just isn\u2019t it (also why does no one literally no one talk about her blowing up the sept)\u2026it\u2019s her power not who gives her the power (which is why Dany is the one who should win because for her it is the opposite but then\u2026 You made it be about the power. Fuck being mhysa, all that matters is what happens when a woman LOSES that child (both these women are plagued by this) and also women can\u2019t actually rule bye) so because Cersei doesn\u2019t give a fuck about anything but her position in the red keep, which I would accept as her only location much better if you at least gave her a story here, so she will of course stay there and keep her forces there and fuck these people anyway, the best way for me to win is to let the other side die as much as possible (and this is especially true after Jon says publicly that he supports daenerys so it\u2019s DONE like at that moment it\u2019s sealed regardless because to her it is now fair game to be political and for her she\u2019s right) <br>\n&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Tangent aside. So Daenerys can have a satisfying end in multiple ways here, and both can recognise the fuckery of the ppl of westeros (which you can ofc also say of how the ww threat is about us killing one another as told with climate change beside it) either she can actually say fuck it I\u2019m going back to essos with my people where we will build our ideal together in a world that doesn\u2019t hate us and we thrive or she can just as well stick around and demand these people bend to the world she will usher forth IDEOLOGICALLY (though they assume force and are proven wrong) but she doesn\u2019t demand her people turn to westerosi culture but says hey westerosi culture is shit if this is what you are saying you\u2019re all about so it can make room for more and I will defend it (as well as all good loving people, as she is fucking mother to all like come on this is actually a form of the story I\u2019ll take when it\u2019s about motherhood?!?!)\u2026<br><br>\nHer power remains in tact, earned through her empathy (even explicitly her motherhood and she loves it!!) as well as her wit and her tact\u2026. She has played a different game than Sansa but a game nonetheless, one of motherhood and not daughterhood, but goddamn it she did it and she CRUSHED IT and she\u2019s the MOTHER OF DRAGONS and you REALLY won\u2019t reward her?! You instead think really it\u2019s better to say \"fuck your power, that exists as a celebration of your femininity that you have been able to weaponise for yourself when needed and celebrate without shame otherwise, that you have managed to back up with tangible physical demonstrations of your power via armies and dragons..first you lose your children, but they\u2019re also the literal foundation of your power militarily speaking, so fuck the motherhood drive, you lose the man you love (because we\u2019ve decided now is the time to have a character injected with this morality, to spite her..) and in a way that has him not just exerting his power over her but him like leeching hers away by just virtue of existing in her space, you take away her armies as well and reduce them from dedicated followers of a woman that inspires them (like oh idk how Jon\u2019s men follow him\u2026) and turn them into foreign brown screaming pillaging invaders.. </p>\n\n<p>Fuck your power as a woman, you\u2019re going to lose it to a man, because you feel grief and anger simultaneously and have been moved to hysterics, he will have the audacity to not even want this power so freely given to him, he will love you until it is your lowest moment after your greatest show of your power in its rawest and most heroic moment, that moment will somehow belong to him in this world where he gets to exist in the mere presence of your power and be thanked for it\u2026 And just as an extra fuck you, your power is going to be stripped from you by the act of love and in trusting men, because we are nothing but the pain you give us\u2026 (Little birds no longer for the grace of our abusers, we fall in love with them and trust them and in the end we are actually most right about our abusers when we justify their actions give them weight in our lives act like they had something to do with our growth and that it\u2019s made us who we are it can\u2019t be all that bad..)\u201d Like. What the fuck?</p>\n\n<p>You give us a story where in the end the woman loses her sense of Justice \u2013 she takes it too far when she had so much raw power because SHE is hysterical, meanwhile men (Jon) are rewarded for not wanting the power\u2026 By giving them power.. God forbid she have ambition though she\u2019s proven herself capable and worthy of it while Jon is a Commander, a leader of soldiers not a ruler, and didn\u2019t Varys have shit to say about that with Robert?! But he sees a grieving woman and suddenly she\u2019s mad\u2026. She\u2019s isolating herself because of course she is, one she\u2019s a queen two she now ACTUALLY has a right to worry those closest to her are plotting against her yet again to take her power or her life or both (and they are), and then when the one person who is able to comfort her has for some reason decided now he suddenly cannot do so, she crumbles into dust. She goes berserk with her power\u2026so she is no longer worthy of it\u2026 So the man, her love and partner, and the noblest bestest warrior in the continent, must put her down for it\u2026 Which makes him worthy or her power, which is acceptably his for the taking because conveniently he\u2019s actually the true heir\u2026</p>\n\n<p>A much better story involves Jon accepting her power, respecting her for it as is one of the justifications for his love for her, and oh idk\u2026 Being cool with being second in command? Like as a ruler?? Cause he\u2026 Isn\u2019t a ruler and doesn\u2019t want it so of course he would be okay with this? And having to destroy her will destroy him and it\u2019ll be told as some reasonable response for why this thus far incredible hero of ours, who we have to be okay with killing our heroine over, who we have all clamoured to have on the throne himself accepting this power he\u2019s \u201cearned\u201d by being born (but only with the right paperwork) because he had demonstrated to us he is worthy of it because he is so heroic\u2026 Why he just leaves it behind, because he can\u2019t be true to himself as a sensitive man who didn\u2019t want any of this (responsibility) in the first place, if he sits in the throne after killing the woman he loves, who he knows was right for it\u2026 </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s because he\u2019ll kill her that we\u2019re like damn I guess I have to feel bad so he can\u2019t use this power of his, but then WHY DID DAENERYS DIE? Why when there is no hero left, no cause for change? Sansa IS the system. Bran is outside of the system. Arya rejects the system, but that\u2019s her story, of internal harmony, not being a revolutionary but of guiding others to internal harmony too\u2026 What\u2019s the fucking point like\u2026 \u201cDude ends up sad after saying, man I really didn\u2019t want that power/privilege ANYWAY so WHY did I have to kill the love of my life who wanted that power, had earned that power, and who I trusted to wield that power, just to prove it to you!!\u201d?? \u201cWoman no longer has principals after a man she loves isn\u2019t there for her in her time of need, inevitably you will become your terrible father your abuse is justified you could have grown from it (embraced it like Sansa) but you wanted to rise above it and destroy those who would try again so you\u2019re the one with the unhappy ending fuck you\u201d a plot device in her own story, a motivation for Jon\u2019s pain and suffering (cause ya know, he\u2019s the victim and that\u2019s true victimhood)\u2026. pointless. </p>\n\n<p>at least this bs inspired me and motivated my true desire yet again\u2026to shit on male media. it\u2019s so bad. you have such a desire for \u201cbeing subversive/unexpected\u201d and y'all think that grimdark fits that bill great like it\u2019s subversive so pair up all this garbage into really shit stories where pain is all there is and it makes you strong or some shit but for women that\u2019s only true if it\u2019s in the form of being raped, or being rejected by a man in some way, or not having a father figure, because it is all about goddamn dudes and Ugh y'all so boring!!! Y'all SO boring!! </p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll give up the opportunity to make nuanced stories about political change and a shifting of worldviews in lieu of telling yet more tales of \u201cwomen are bad at being in power but also most especially at failing when their femininity is dead like definitely their reasons for living which are their children and the dicks in their lives and also always make sure to remember it\u2019s only compelling when that woman loses this power to a man but more importantly through the act of loving a man (cause that\u2019s also what women are for but also this is their most painful life experience obviously..)\u201d\u2026 that men would and could do a better job\u2026</p>\n\n<p>have the \u201cbest\u201d candidate you demanded, who couldn\u2019t possibly be by her side willingly and enthusiastically and proud of her power (???? y tho) say in the end though, yeah, that was a bad process of trying to get there even though I had no need to do anything to get it so I am going to say nah\u2026not interested\u2026 No real world change yet the shit ppl who treated not just danys ppl wrong but honestly the system has worked against jon his whole life as well..those shit ppl are all still just fine and who cares\u2026 </p>\n\n<p>In the end why not (1) allow him to radicalise, allow him to drive social change as leaders do\u2026 (2) have him support proudly the one willing to drive change if he is not interested in such. Why \u201che don\u2019t need it no more he sad\u201d as if that\u2019s\u2026. better\u2026.than confronting the system\u2026\u2026. killing a woman for manpain\u2026is apparently\u2026a better\u2026 story..than confronting\u2026. oppression and oppressors\u2026.of accepting and loving a woman in power\u2026.wow\u2026.damn..dang\u2026.

Can&rsquo;t remember lol) also treated with such vitriolic distaste..hm&hellip;. like they just hate brown ppl poor dothraki unsullied missandei..god). Her dragons are so frightening to someone who doesn&rsquo;t see them as having personhood ..but they are her children truly. </p>\n\n<p>So say daenerys does all she does up until .. The Bell.. And then she just perches. She settles down. She can enter the damn keep herself, with her dragon allowing her to guide his actions (she&rsquo;s first of all a badass!! I&rsquo;m cheated! She commands power so let&rsquo;s recognise that!) and the ppl see this. He is visually frightening to them and yet entirely harmless in this moment cause he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;what I&rsquo;m fighting for my mom like&hellip;I ain&rsquo;t gonna ruin her day cause she taught me better than that !!&rdquo; not to say that dragon = brown person (if im giving that impression im failing terribly), but that dragon = soldier with a brain also, and being capable of fighting =/= monster. There are white westerosi soldiers on this battlefield as well as dany&rsquo;s forces and context is what drives ppl&rsquo;s opinions of them. </p>\n\n<p>Like the ppl are whack and you could&rsquo;ve had a cool DRAGON CONSCIOUSNESS SUBPLOT CAUSE DRAGON and also been willing to say these people are fucking racist dude, not cause of the dragons obviously but because daenerys controls the forces under her first of all but primarily that uhhhh they don&rsquo;t fucking act that way to begin with?? but like nah&hellip; Instead we see &ldquo;the extinction of the dothraki people basically&rdquo; but then suddenly it&rsquo;s&hellip;half? so they come back from the dead just to mob king&rsquo;s landing&hellip;prove the racist and xenophobic westerosi right&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..cool. what could begin the peoples&rsquo; change of opinions regarding the barbarism of the dothraki, unsullied, and dragons is a ceasing of hostilities upon assured victory&hellip;but instead&hellip;we have&hellip;FiRe AnD bLoOd</p>\n\n<p>(When honest she didn&rsquo;t need a single one of them ANYWAY?! fleet? Her, scorpions? Her&hellip; At this point she wins because literally no foot soldier can kill a DRAGON LITERAL DRAGON ..the gate then, her again, coming into play as she can literally hang out, wait for Jon to back her up w his forces cause sometimes a story where heroes are triumphant and get to feel it are good ones&hellip;) </p>\n\n<p>Anyway this is to say that her narrative could have been taken in a direction that showed her to be a true revolutionary in a world full of bigots and you could have directly said these people&rsquo;s xenophobia and colourism and racism and, for that matter misogyny, is as was to the slavers she previously conquered and destroyed. You could have allowed this to be told in your story first off but with a woman to boot but nah the better story is saying fuck that it&rsquo;s unfair to let Jon not be the undisputed hero (and I love him) but cooler for him to kill that woman who actually goes crazy (cause SHE&rsquo;S just like her father, but while Jon suffers the same treatment he is conveniently spared having to choose because in the end they&rsquo;re both so Noble and honourable of men) and defies and defiles everything she has ever stood for in just moments because she cannot be trusted with this raw power (she who CAGED this power and who this power respects) while in the AFTERMATH of losing virtually everything she has in this life barring her chase for the security of the throne (as there has to be a reason for what&rsquo;s happened to her people there&rsquo;s no going back) you don&rsquo;t let her receive comfort from her partner, at this point just flat out one of the last people left ALIVE that cares for her which is what is understandably getting to her, that those she loves are all dying and NOT about Jon and him rejecting her love eye roll! </p>\n\n<p>But so you don&rsquo;t let him comfort her, though his heroism is justified by his care for people and his desire for tenderness&hellip;him&hellip;this guy, THE &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; (no one says mad about that ten year old he hanged!) isn&rsquo;t gonna comfort the woman he loves????? And how&rsquo;s that better&hellip;. This narrative of &ldquo;in the end the woman we propped up, we just did it to make it a real point that her power didn&rsquo;t matter when it came head to head with a man&rsquo;s rejection&hellip; She&rsquo;ll lose every time! Ha ha she&rsquo;s crazy for losing everything we made her lose in the most absurd of fashions!&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&gt;&gt;(A WIGHT hunt? For CERSEI?? her odds were always going to be best by NOT participating because&hellip;Dany&hellip;has.. DRAGONS! then daenerys KIND OF FORGOT?! And couldn&rsquo;t SEE? And couldn&rsquo;t expect an ambush to her left behind ancestral home DIRECTLY after SHE did it to CERSEI <i>LANNISTER</i> even though it ended up or perhaps specifically BECAUSE it was a tactical blunder in the end, SHE DOESN&rsquo;T EXPECT THIS FROM CERSEI?! ( aside from like..it being OBVIOUS ANYWAY?) not like Jon JUST WON HIS BACK ALSO AND THEY&rsquo;RE STANDING IN IT when they talk about THAT FLEET SHE FORGOT???!?!?!!  I&rsquo;m heated at the stupidity lol I&rsquo;m sorry but anyway WHAT. </p>\n\n<p>She loses both her dragons for an absurd reason, which coincidentally both happen to be rooted in trusting Cersei, or accepting Tyrion&rsquo;s interpretation of her&hellip; He&rsquo;s convinced she cares about casterly rock first of all doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d go for high garden second of all after damn well knowing not only was the crown in debt (MASTER OF COIN? HAND?) but also knowing the Lannisters weren&rsquo;t in the position to fund two regimes at this point in comparison to the potential tyrells, and he also doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d consider taking their shit?? wouldn&rsquo;t tywin, and then the obvious like&hellip; Really thinking she&rsquo;d be convinced by the wight? Why would cersei care? It would take all of them for it, the long night, to get to her&hellip; She knows these fucking dragons mean business which you do show with all the scorpions but you don&rsquo;t allow her the political fore thought to be like yeah I can&rsquo;t take that already so either these guys win and hopefully suffer losses or they lose and we lose anyways&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Tyrion is like yeah but haha she&rsquo;ll care about the lives and stuff then like dude are you out of touch, if he&rsquo;d had eyes on that Shame walk he&rsquo;d know that just isn&rsquo;t it (also why does no one literally no one talk about her blowing up the sept)&hellip;it&rsquo;s her power not who gives her the power (which is why Dany is the one who should win because for her it is the opposite but then&hellip; You made it be about the power. Fuck being mhysa, all that matters is what happens when a woman LOSES that child (both these women are plagued by this) and also women can&rsquo;t actually rule bye) so because Cersei doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck about anything but her position in the red keep, which I would accept as her only location much better if you at least gave her a story here, so she will of course stay there and keep her forces there and fuck these people anyway, the best way for me to win is to let the other side die as much as possible (and this is especially true after Jon says publicly that he supports daenerys so it&rsquo;s DONE like at that moment it&rsquo;s sealed regardless because to her it is now fair game to be political and for her she&rsquo;s right) <br />\n&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Tangent aside. So Daenerys can have a satisfying end in multiple ways here, and both can recognise the fuckery of the ppl of westeros (which you can ofc also say of how the ww threat is about us killing one another as told with climate change beside it) either she can actually say fuck it I&rsquo;m going back to essos with my people where we will build our ideal together in a world that doesn&rsquo;t hate us and we thrive or she can just as well stick around and demand these people bend to the world she will usher forth IDEOLOGICALLY (though they assume force and are proven wrong) but she doesn&rsquo;t demand her people turn to westerosi culture but says hey westerosi culture is shit if this is what you are saying you&rsquo;re all about so it can make room for more and I will defend it (as well as all good loving people, as she is fucking mother to all like come on this is actually a form of the story I&rsquo;ll take when it&rsquo;s about motherhood?!?!)&hellip;<br /><br />\nHer power remains in tact, earned through her empathy (even explicitly her motherhood and she loves it!!) as well as her wit and her tact&hellip;. She has played a different game than Sansa but a game nonetheless, one of motherhood and not daughterhood, but goddamn it she did it and she CRUSHED IT and she&rsquo;s the MOTHER OF DRAGONS and you REALLY won&rsquo;t reward her?! You instead think really it&rsquo;s better to say \"fuck your power, that exists as a celebration of your femininity that you have been able to weaponise for yourself when needed and celebrate without shame otherwise, that you have managed to back up with tangible physical demonstrations of your power via armies and dragons..first you lose your children, but they&rsquo;re also the literal foundation of your power militarily speaking, so fuck the motherhood drive, you lose the man you love (because we&rsquo;ve decided now is the time to have a character injected with this morality, to spite her..) and in a way that has him not just exerting his power over her but him like leeching hers away by just virtue of existing in her space, you take away her armies as well and reduce them from dedicated followers of a woman that inspires them (like oh idk how Jon&rsquo;s men follow him&hellip;) and turn them into foreign brown screaming pillaging invaders.. </p>\n\n<p>Fuck your power as a woman, you&rsquo;re going to lose it to a man, because you feel grief and anger simultaneously and have been moved to hysterics, he will have the audacity to not even want this power so freely given to him, he will love you until it is your lowest moment after your greatest show of your power in its rawest and most heroic moment, that moment will somehow belong to him in this world where he gets to exist in the mere presence of your power and be thanked for it&hellip; And just as an extra fuck you, your power is going to be stripped from you by the act of love and in trusting men, because we are nothing but the pain you give us&hellip; (Little birds no longer for the grace of our abusers, we fall in love with them and trust them and in the end we are actually most right about our abusers when we justify their actions give them weight in our lives act like they had something to do with our growth and that it&rsquo;s made us who we are it can&rsquo;t be all that bad..)&rdquo; Like. What the fuck?</p>\n\n<p>You give us a story where in the end the woman loses her sense of Justice &ndash; she takes it too far when she had so much raw power because SHE is hysterical, meanwhile men (Jon) are rewarded for not wanting the power&hellip; By giving them power.. God forbid she have ambition though she&rsquo;s proven herself capable and worthy of it while Jon is a Commander, a leader of soldiers not a ruler, and didn&rsquo;t Varys have shit to say about that with Robert?! But he sees a grieving woman and suddenly she&rsquo;s mad&hellip;. She&rsquo;s isolating herself because of course she is, one she&rsquo;s a queen two she now ACTUALLY has a right to worry those closest to her are plotting against her yet again to take her power or her life or both (and they are), and then when the one person who is able to comfort her has for some reason decided now he suddenly cannot do so, she crumbles into dust. She goes berserk with her power&hellip;so she is no longer worthy of it&hellip; So the man, her love and partner, and the noblest bestest warrior in the continent, must put her down for it&hellip; Which makes him worthy or her power, which is acceptably his for the taking because conveniently he&rsquo;s actually the true heir&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>A much better story involves Jon accepting her power, respecting her for it as is one of the justifications for his love for her, and oh idk&hellip; Being cool with being second in command? Like as a ruler?? Cause he&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t a ruler and doesn&rsquo;t want it so of course he would be okay with this? And having to destroy her will destroy him and it&rsquo;ll be told as some reasonable response for why this thus far incredible hero of ours, who we have to be okay with killing our heroine over, who we have all clamoured to have on the throne himself accepting this power he&rsquo;s &ldquo;earned&rdquo; by being born (but only with the right paperwork) because he had demonstrated to us he is worthy of it because he is so heroic&hellip; Why he just leaves it behind, because he can&rsquo;t be true to himself as a sensitive man who didn&rsquo;t want any of this (responsibility) in the first place, if he sits in the throne after killing the woman he loves, who he knows was right for it&hellip; </p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;ll kill her that we&rsquo;re like damn I guess I have to feel bad so he can&rsquo;t use this power of his, but then WHY DID DAENERYS DIE? Why when there is no hero left, no cause for change? Sansa IS the system. Bran is outside of the system. Arya rejects the system, but that&rsquo;s her story, of internal harmony, not being a revolutionary but of guiding others to internal harmony too&hellip; What&rsquo;s the fucking point like&hellip; &ldquo;Dude ends up sad after saying, man I really didn&rsquo;t want that power/privilege ANYWAY so WHY did I have to kill the love of my life who wanted that power, had earned that power, and who I trusted to wield that power, just to prove it to you!!&rdquo;?? &ldquo;Woman no longer has principals after a man she loves isn&rsquo;t there for her in her time of need, inevitably you will become your terrible father your abuse is justified you could have grown from it (embraced it like Sansa) but you wanted to rise above it and destroy those who would try again so you&rsquo;re the one with the unhappy ending fuck you&rdquo; a plot device in her own story, a motivation for Jon&rsquo;s pain and suffering (cause ya know, he&rsquo;s the victim and that&rsquo;s true victimhood)&hellip;. pointless. </p>\n\n<p>at least this bs inspired me and motivated my true desire yet again&hellip;to shit on male media. it&rsquo;s so bad. you have such a desire for &ldquo;being subversive/unexpected&rdquo; and y'all think that grimdark fits that bill great like it&rsquo;s subversive so pair up all this garbage into really shit stories where pain is all there is and it makes you strong or some shit but for women that&rsquo;s only true if it&rsquo;s in the form of being raped, or being rejected by a man in some way, or not having a father figure, because it is all about goddamn dudes and Ugh y'all so boring!!! Y'all SO boring!! </p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll give up the opportunity to make nuanced stories about political change and a shifting of worldviews in lieu of telling yet more tales of &ldquo;women are bad at being in power but also most especially at failing when their femininity is dead like definitely their reasons for living which are their children and the dicks in their lives and also always make sure to remember it&rsquo;s only compelling when that woman loses this power to a man but more importantly through the act of loving a man (cause that&rsquo;s also what women are for but also this is their most painful life experience obviously..)&rdquo;&hellip; that men would and could do a better job&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>have the &ldquo;best&rdquo; candidate you demanded, who couldn&rsquo;t possibly be by her side willingly and enthusiastically and proud of her power (???? y tho) say in the end though, yeah, that was a bad process of trying to get there even though I had no need to do anything to get it so I am going to say nah&hellip;not interested&hellip; No real world change yet the shit ppl who treated not just danys ppl wrong but honestly the system has worked against jon his whole life as well..those shit ppl are all still just fine and who cares&hellip; </p>\n\n<p>In the end why not (1) allow him to radicalise, allow him to drive social change as leaders do&hellip; (2) have him support proudly the one willing to drive change if he is not interested in such. Why &ldquo;he don&rsquo;t need it no more he sad&rdquo; as if that&rsquo;s&hellip;. better&hellip;.than confronting the system&hellip;&hellip;. killing a woman for manpain&hellip;is apparently&hellip;a better&hellip; story..than confronting&hellip;. oppression and oppressors&hellip;.of accepting and loving a woman in power&hellip;.wow&hellip;.damn..dang&hellip;. I sure am glad that the author is dead and once you&rsquo;ve monetised your worlds and characters they&rsquo;re ours to mold and take in the RIGHT directions. Because that&rsquo;s stupid and I&rsquo;m sick of getting it with every new &ldquo;innovative, ground breaking, fucking insane incredible and super big balls impressive&rdquo; story a white guy comes up with</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m just saying y'all out her acting like the true evil is Daenerys caring that she lost people and has no support system, that she was pushed to the edge and considers crossing a line, that she can&rsquo;t let go in the immediate aftermath of trauma, instead of that the system is twofold disgusting and vile, top to bottom xenophobia and misogyny are rampant, and the top exploit the bottom (so of course their recourse is to support the conflict of all their &ldquo;lowers&rdquo; by right of existing as different people)&hellip;.you&rsquo;re saying the important takeaway is, women in power are dangerous because they&rsquo;re emotional&hellip;not that their emotions empower them&hellip;boring. </p>\n\n<p>I long for the days of a massively scaled world experience of entertainment like this series has become, ubiquitous in people&rsquo;s lives as a part of culture, that actually tells the right stories. That prioritises a narrative of change but faith to its characters instead of &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; leading to the ultimate gotcha: women don&rsquo;t matter. Like snooze fest 3000. Don&rsquo;t need the social change angle in every story I consume but I sure need you to justify why a series predicated on it, that roots its heroes&rsquo; ultimate heroism strength and power through their ability to enact social change, if this is idealistic and driven by a desire for change or through force of will and proving ability, why does this series abandon the tale and destroy the big pillar of change for &ldquo;shock&rdquo; (manpain) &hellip;.women hating really is a way of life for some people huh. can&rsquo;t relate</p>",
