He treated everything like it was life or death, even dates. I let out a sigh of relief when I saw him get out of the cab across the street. He waved as he ran across the street, dodging cars as he went.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHi. Sorry I\u2019m late. Got caught up with something.\u201d John said as he kissed my cheek and took his seat across from me.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay John. Was it a possession?\u201d I asked. John shook his head and gave me a small smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHospital.\u201d he said flatly. I nodded. John knew I didn\u2019t like hospitals and didn\u2019t talk about them or what he did there when I was around.\u00a0\u201cHow was your day?\u201d He asked. I shrugged.<br/></p><p>\u201cI was okay. This is the best thing that\u2019s happened all day.\u201d I admitted. John frowned.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I gave John a look that said I didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u00a0\u201cSeriously. I wanna hear all about your shit day.\u201d John reached across the table and slide his hand under mine. For the next half hour, I told John all about the people I had to deal with that made my day terrible. He rubbed his thumb against the back of my hand in a calming gesture throughout my rant, even when our food came.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay. Enough sad stuff. Aside from the hospital, what else did you do today?\u201d I asked as I squeezed John\u2019s hand. He shrugged.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI pulled a demon from a little girl. Other than that, not much happened to me today.\u201d John said without a glance at me.<br/></p><p>\u201cSounds eventful. Wait what was a demon doing possessing a girl? I thought only half-breeds&hellip;\u201d I started. John nodded.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThe veil is lifting.\u201d He muttered. I shivered at the thought. He noticed.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d he stood up and offered me his hand. I stood up and took his hand. John led me to a park. I could tell something was wrong but I also knew John Constantine well enough to know not to push him. He would tell me when he was ready to tell me. John played with my hand he was holding.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), I know that you don\u2019t like to talk about the hospital and what happens there, but this is important and you need to know.\u201d John started as he pulled me to sit on a bench. I furrowed my brow.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean John?\u201d I asked, concern filling my voice. John looked at me but it seemed like he was looking through me, trying to find the right words. He shook his head and took a deep breath. His eyes focused on me and for the first time since I\u2019d known him, John Constantine was scared.\u00a0\u201cJohn, you\u2019re scaring me. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d I pushed. John stood up and started walking away. I followed when he turned around to look at me again. He took my hand again and I held onto his arm. We walked back to his apartment in silence. When we got there, John poured himself a drink.\u00a0\u201cJohn are you going to tell me what\u2019s wrong or not?\u201d I asked him. John took a drag of his cigarette and shook his head.\u00a0\u201cFine. Then I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d I stormed away.<br/></p><p>I fell asleep but barely. I could hear John moving around the apartment and moved closer to him when I felt him get in bed. It was a couple hours later when I heard him coughing. I sat up as he ran to the bathroom. I followed and saw the blood in the sink before he could wash it down the drain. He watched me in the mirror to see my reaction.\u00a0\u201cJOHN! Why are you coughing up blood?!\u201d I yelled. John moved past me and started to pull on his shirt and tie.\u00a0\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d I screamed. John lit a cigarette.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to tell you yesterday but I didn\u2019t have the courage to tell you.\u201d John said as he took a drag.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTell me now John.\u201d I begged as I knelt down in front of him. He got up to pour himself a drink. I followed and leaned on the table. He sighed.<br/></p><p>\u201cI have cancer.\u201d He said bluntly. My eyes widened.<br/></p><p>\u201cJohn&hellip;\u201d I started.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said as he took another drag.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cStop smoking dammit!\u201d I yelled. John gave me a look.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s causing the cancer isn\u2019t it?\u201d He nodded.\u00a0\u201cThen stop you idiot!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c(Y/N)&hellip;\u201d He started.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head.\u00a0\u201cJohn you need to stop. I\u2019ve been through this once. I don\u2019t want to go through it with you. Not you.\u201d I said as tears pricked my eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cThen go.\u201d John said as he pointed to the door. I shook my head again. He looked at me, eyes full of confusion and love.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go through this again but I\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d I said through tears.\u00a0\u201cthere has to be something we can do. Or even Gabriel&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI already saw Gabriel. Bastard half-breed wouldn\u2019t do anything. Not even see if there was anything to do about the sentence.\u201d John threw back the drink. I sighed and moved to sit in his lap. John raised his eyebrow at me as I settled in his lap.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go see him. Half-breed won\u2019t know what hit him.\u201d I said as I wrapped my arms around John\u2019s neck. He smiled and shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve been helping Chas study and I think I\u2019ve picked somethings up from you watching you do this for how long now? I\u2019ll be ok.\u201d John kissed my cheek.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d John chuckled and started to kiss down to my neck. He stilled there and held me close to him.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go making any deals (Y/N). I won\u2019t allow it. You aren\u2019t going down if I can help it.\u201d John promised.\u00a0\u201cI love you too much.\u201d I smiled as I pulled John\u2019s head back up.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d I said as I pressed my lips to his.\u00a0<br/></p>",

He treated everything like it was life or death, even dates. I let out a sigh of relief when I saw him get out of the cab across the street. He waved as he ran across the street, dodging cars as he went.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHi. Sorry I\u2019m late. Got caught up with something.\u201d John said as he kissed my cheek and took his seat across from me.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay John. Was it a possession?\u201d I asked. John shook his head and gave me a small smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHospital.\u201d he said flatly. I nodded. John knew I didn\u2019t like hospitals and didn\u2019t talk about them or what he did there when I was around.\u00a0\u201cHow was your day?\u201d He asked. I shrugged.<br></p><p>\u201cI was okay. This is the best thing that\u2019s happened all day.\u201d I admitted. John frowned.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I gave John a look that said I didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u00a0\u201cSeriously. I wanna hear all about your shit day.\u201d John reached across the table and slide his hand under mine. For the next half hour, I told John all about the people I had to deal with that made my day terrible. He rubbed his thumb against the back of my hand in a calming gesture throughout my rant, even when our food came.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay. Enough sad stuff. Aside from the hospital, what else did you do today?\u201d I asked as I squeezed John\u2019s hand. He shrugged.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI pulled a demon from a little girl. Other than that, not much happened to me today.\u201d John said without a glance at me.<br></p><p>\u201cSounds eventful. Wait what was a demon doing possessing a girl? I thought only half-breeds\u2026\u201d I started. John nodded.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThe veil is lifting.\u201d He muttered. I shivered at the thought. He noticed.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d he stood up and offered me his hand. I stood up and took his hand. John led me to a park. I could tell something was wrong but I also knew John Constantine well enough to know not to push him. He would tell me when he was ready to tell me. John played with my hand he was holding.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), I know that you don\u2019t like to talk about the hospital and what happens there, but this is important and you need to know.\u201d John started as he pulled me to sit on a bench. I furrowed my brow.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean John?\u201d I asked, concern filling my voice. John looked at me but it seemed like he was looking through me, trying to find the right words. He shook his head and took a deep breath. His eyes focused on me and for the first time since I\u2019d known him, John Constantine was scared.\u00a0\u201cJohn, you\u2019re scaring me. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d I pushed. John stood up and started walking away. I followed when he turned around to look at me again. He took my hand again and I held onto his arm. We walked back to his apartment in silence. When we got there, John poured himself a drink.\u00a0\u201cJohn are you going to tell me what\u2019s wrong or not?\u201d I asked him. John took a drag of his cigarette and shook his head.\u00a0\u201cFine. Then I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d I stormed away.<br></p><p>I fell asleep but barely. I could hear John moving around the apartment and moved closer to him when I felt him get in bed. It was a couple hours later when I heard him coughing. I sat up as he ran to the bathroom. I followed and saw the blood in the sink before he could wash it down the drain. He watched me in the mirror to see my reaction.\u00a0\u201cJOHN! Why are you coughing up blood?!\u201d I yelled. John moved past me and started to pull on his shirt and tie.\u00a0\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d I screamed. John lit a cigarette.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to tell you yesterday but I didn\u2019t have the courage to tell you.\u201d John said as he took a drag.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTell me now John.\u201d I begged as I knelt down in front of him. He got up to pour himself a drink. I followed and leaned on the table. He sighed.<br></p><p>\u201cI have cancer.\u201d He said bluntly. My eyes widened.<br></p><p>\u201cJohn\u2026\u201d I started.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said as he took another drag.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStop smoking dammit!\u201d I yelled. John gave me a look.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s causing the cancer isn\u2019t it?\u201d He nodded.\u00a0\u201cThen stop you idiot!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026\u201d He started.<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head.\u00a0\u201cJohn you need to stop. I\u2019ve been through this once. I don\u2019t want to go through it with you. Not you.\u201d I said as tears pricked my eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cThen go.\u201d John said as he pointed to the door. I shook my head again. He looked at me, eyes full of confusion and love.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go through this again but I\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d I said through tears.\u00a0\u201cthere has to be something we can do. Or even Gabriel\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI already saw Gabriel. Bastard half-breed wouldn\u2019t do anything. Not even see if there was anything to do about the sentence.\u201d John threw back the drink. I sighed and moved to sit in his lap. John raised his eyebrow at me as I settled in his lap.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go see him. Half-breed won\u2019t know what hit him.\u201d I said as I wrapped my arms around John\u2019s neck. He smiled and shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve been helping Chas study and I think I\u2019ve picked somethings up from you watching you do this for how long now? I\u2019ll be ok.\u201d John kissed my cheek.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d John chuckled and started to kiss down to my neck. He stilled there and held me close to him.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go making any deals (Y/N). I won\u2019t allow it. You aren\u2019t going down if I can help it.\u201d John promised.\u00a0\u201cI love you too much.\u201d I smiled as I pulled John\u2019s head back up.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d I said as I pressed my lips to his.\u00a0<br></p>",

            "description": "In addition to the pain and the exhaustion, he recalled how waiting on the cross between takes became tedious. To fight the boredom, he listened to music on headphones. One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",
