From the moment they walked in Alexia and Daphn\u00e9 had been gawking at and giggling about the person behind the register. He was tall and slim with wild hair and stormy blue eyes, when they had ordered he flashed them a bright smile and you could hear the swooning sighs they had let out. Lucas was the last to order and he gave the barista a smile before heading off to the table the girls were at.</p><p>\u201cGirl, you <i>have</i> to get his number. Do you see him? If not, I\u2019m going in.\u201d Alexia reached over the table to lightly slap the other girl on the arm. Manon bat her hand away with a light flush on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cReally? I mean he\u2019s cute, but should I really do it?\u201d She glanced over at the worker and snapped her eyes away when she caught his eyes. She placed her hand on Lucas beside her and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t, you <i>just</i> had a bad date last week.\u201d Lucas shrugged and glanced at all the girls who had a confused look on their faces.</p><p>\u201cBut that means that now she can get over that. Come on Lucas he\u2019s <i>gorgeous</i>, this is what Manon <i>needs</i>.\u201d Emma squinted as the boy huffed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m just <i>saying, </i>maybe she doesn\u2019t want a date.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201c</i>Are you kidding me Lucas?

What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>The boy tucked the tray under his arm as he finished setting everything down. \u201cOh, I usually work nights before closing and early mornings. I\u2019m Eliott.\u201d He flashed his smile and glanced at Manon\u2019s side of the table, his smile growing impossibly wider. Emma, Daphn\u00e9, and Alexia practically had hearts in their eyes, Imane raised her eyebrows and chuckled at how ridiculous the girls were being, and Lucas was just quietly scowling at all of them, keeping his eyes away from Eliott. </p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Eliott, say, our girl Manon over here has just been discussing about how no one seems to want to date her, can you tell her how utter bullshit that is? I mean, look at her, who wouldn\u2019t wanna kiss this beautiful face?\u201d Emma reached out to squish Manon\u2019s cheeks but was quickly slapped away by her blushing friend, mumbling, <i>Jesus, don\u2019t make me sound so<b> desperate</b></i><b>.</b> All the girls looked to Eliott for his answer while Lucas sat there and burned holes into the boy\u2019s head with his glare.</p><p>Eliott glanced at Lucas and something flashed in his eyes before turning to Manon with a crinkly-eyed smile. \u201cYeah. Really beautiful. Don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t have a boyfriend yet.\u201d Everyone heard Lucas scoff but chose to ignore it in favor of watching Manon and Eliott. The girl quickly looked down at her lap and started fidgeting with her napkin before looking back at Eliott with a smile.</p><p>\u201cShe really is, how about going on a date with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaphn\u00e9!\u201d Manon practically shrieked at the blonde\u2019s blunt question. Imane and Emma started laughing at the look on Eliott\u2019s face while Lucas gave a surprised squeak with his mouth agape. </p><p>Eliott stood there shocked for a second before chuckling and gazing at Manon. \u201cI\u2019m really flattered, truly. You seem great, but I\u2019m in a relationship at the moment.\u201d He gave an apologetic smile as his eyes flitted past the girl for second before looking back to her. \u201cI should really get back to work, it was nice meeting all of you, thank you for the entertainment.\u201d He gave a parting wave and spun on his heel, going back to behind the counter and beginning to clean some utensils.</p><p>Imane sighed and began to eat. \u201cDaph that was way too forward, you scared him.\u201d The blonde blushed, picking up her fork and moving her food around the plate. \u201cSorry Manon, I really thought this would work out.\u201d</p><p>Manon gave Daphn\u00e9 a pat on the arm, \u201cIt\u2019s fine babe, I\u2019ll find a good one soon.\u201d As she said this she turned to Lucas and gave him a smirk. \u201cSpeaking of, our little boy here has someone but refuses to tell anyone about it.\u201d Manon pushed her bottom lip out in a pout.</p><p>Emma clutched at her heart and gasped \u201cLucas! You\u2019re getting some dick and haven\u2019t <i>told</i> us? The <i>audacity</i>.\u201d</p><p>Lucas turned bright red and shushed her \u201cShut the fuck <i>up</i>, you\u2019re so <i>loud</i>.\u201d He glanced at the register for a quick second before rubbing a hand over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s new, we only became \u2018official\u2019 two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 squealed and started bouncing in her seat, \u201cOh my GOD! What\u2019s his name? What does he do? How old is he? How tall is he? Is he pretty?\u201d</p><p>Lucas grimaced and shook his head, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon I promise.\u201d He picked up his sandwich and began to eat while the girls kept pestering him with questions.</p><p>\u201cDo you really wanna meet him that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>!\u201d All the girls shrieked and Lucas rolled his eyes at them.</p><p>\u201cFine, okay you can meet him. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, when?\u201d Lucas glanced past Manon, a bright smile taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cIn a bit.\u201d Lucas said as he continued eating. The girls shrugged and slipped into silence as they all picked up their food.</p><p>After a little while everyone was done eating and they just sat there talking. \u201cYou got an ETA on lover boy Lucas?\u201d</p><p>Lucas lifted his head and looked towards the front of the cafe before nodding, \u201cYeah, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong time no see.\u201d A voice behind Manon spoke up and heads whipped to see Eliott standing in casual clothes instead of his apron. All the girls sat there confused until realization slowly hit them.</p><p>Lucas stood up and walked over to the taller boy, smiling up at him. Eliott placed his hands on both of Lucas\u2019 cheeks, giving him a gentle kiss. \u201cHi baby, how was your day?\u201d</p><p>Lucas hummed and shrugged his shoulders \u201cIt was good, spent it with the girls. Didn\u2019t do much else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you led them to <i>my</i> cafe just so you can see me? Babe, you\u2019re so <i>cute</i>!\u201d Lucas scowl and pulled away from Eliott\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m breaking up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, nooooooo.\u201d Elliot made grabby hands for his boyfriend but they were dodged.</p><p>The girls just started at them with wide eyes because what the <i>fuck</i>. This was the guy they were just trying to set up with Manon, who was practically Lucas\u2019 <i>sister</i>.</p><p>Imane cleared her throat for attention, raising her eyebrows when Lucas gave her a sheepish look. \u201cSo, uh. This is my boyfriend, Eliott. Thank you so very much for trying to pawn him off on Manon, much appreciated.\u201d</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 at least had the decency to look embarrassed, Alexia licked her lips and smirked. \u201cWell <i>that\u2019s</i> a threesome I wouldn\u2019t mind being in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my fucking <i>god</i>, you\u2019re a fucking <i>heathen</i>. We\u2019re <i>leaving</i>.\u201d Lucas started tugging at Eliott\u2019s hand while the boy waved. laughing out a <i>nice to meet you </i>over his shoulder before his boyfriend ripped the door open and sprinted outside.</p><p>The girls all looked at each other and doubled over in laughter. \u201cWell, at least he\u2019ll be less grumpy now that he\u2019s getting dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Emma!</b></i>\u201d</p>",

Really beautiful. Don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t have a boyfriend yet.\u201d Everyone heard Lucas scoff but chose to ignore it in favor of watching Manon and Eliott. The girl quickly looked down at her lap and started fidgeting with her napkin before looking back at Eliott with a smile.</p><p>\u201cShe really is, how about going on a date with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaphn\u00e9!\u201d Manon practically shrieked at the blonde\u2019s blunt question. Imane and Emma started laughing at the look on Eliott\u2019s face while Lucas gave a surprised squeak with his mouth agape. </p><p>Eliott stood there shocked for a second before chuckling and gazing at Manon. \u201cI\u2019m really flattered, truly. You seem great, but I\u2019m in a relationship at the moment.\u201d He gave an apologetic smile as his eyes flitted past the girl for second before looking back to her. \u201cI should really get back to work, it was nice meeting all of you, thank you for the entertainment.\u201d He gave a parting wave and spun on his heel, going back to behind the counter and beginning to clean some utensils.</p><p>Imane sighed and began to eat. \u201cDaph that was way too forward, you scared him.\u201d The blonde blushed, picking up her fork and moving her food around the plate. \u201cSorry Manon, I really thought this would work out.\u201d</p><p>Manon gave Daphn\u00e9 a pat on the arm, \u201cIt\u2019s fine babe, I\u2019ll find a good one soon.\u201d As she said this she turned to Lucas and gave him a smirk. \u201cSpeaking of, our little boy here has someone but refuses to tell anyone about it.\u201d Manon pushed her bottom lip out in a pout.</p><p>Emma clutched at her heart and gasped \u201cLucas! You\u2019re getting some dick and haven\u2019t <i>told</i> us?

Is he pretty?\u201d</p><p>Lucas grimaced and shook his head, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon I promise.\u201d He picked up his sandwich and began to eat while the girls kept pestering him with questions.</p><p>\u201cDo you really wanna meet him that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>!\u201d All the girls shrieked and Lucas rolled his eyes at them.</p><p>\u201cFine, okay you can meet him. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, when?\u201d Lucas glanced past Manon, a bright smile taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cIn a bit.\u201d Lucas said as he continued eating. The girls shrugged and slipped into silence as they all picked up their food.</p><p>After a little while everyone was done eating and they just sat there talking. \u201cYou got an ETA on lover boy Lucas?\u201d</p><p>Lucas lifted his head and looked towards the front of the cafe before nodding, \u201cYeah, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong time no see.\u201d A voice behind Manon spoke up and heads whipped to see Eliott standing in casual clothes instead of his apron. All the girls sat there confused until realization slowly hit them.</p><p>Lucas stood up and walked over to the taller boy, smiling up at him. Eliott placed his hands on both of Lucas\u2019 cheeks, giving him a gentle kiss. \u201cHi baby, how was your day?\u201d</p><p>Lucas hummed and shrugged his shoulders \u201cIt was good, spent it with the girls. Didn\u2019t do much else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you led them to <i>my</i> cafe just so you can see me? Babe, you\u2019re so <i>cute</i>!\u201d Lucas scowl and pulled away from Eliott\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m breaking up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, nooooooo.\u201d Elliot made grabby hands for his boyfriend but they were dodged.</p><p>The girls just started at them with wide eyes because what the <i>fuck</i>. This was the guy they were just trying to set up with Manon, who was practically Lucas\u2019 <i>sister</i>.</p><p>Imane cleared her throat for attention, raising her eyebrows when Lucas gave her a sheepish look. \u201cSo, uh. This is my boyfriend, Eliott. Thank you so very much for trying to pawn him off on Manon, much appreciated.\u201d</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 at least had the decency to look embarrassed, Alexia licked her lips and smirked. \u201cWell <i>that\u2019s</i> a threesome I wouldn\u2019t mind being in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my fucking <i>god</i>, you\u2019re a fucking <i>heathen</i>. We\u2019re <i>leaving</i>.\u201d Lucas started tugging at Eliott\u2019s hand while the boy waved. laughing out a <i>nice to meet you </i>over his shoulder before his boyfriend ripped the door open and sprinted outside.</p><p>The girls all looked at each other and doubled over in laughter. \u201cWell, at least he\u2019ll be less grumpy now that he\u2019s getting dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Emma!</b></i>\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>The girls are just trying to set Manon up with the cute barista behind the counter, but Lucas isn&rsquo;t having any of it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Manon he&rsquo;s <i>definitely</i> staring at you.&rdquo; The girls and Lucas had decided to get something to eat on a sunny Saturday at a local cafe. From the moment they walked in Alexia and Daphn&eacute; had been gawking at and giggling about the person behind the register. He was tall and slim with wild hair and stormy blue eyes, when they had ordered he flashed them a bright smile and you could hear the swooning sighs they had let out. Lucas was the last to order and he gave the barista a smile before heading off to the table the girls were at.</p><p>&ldquo;Girl, you <i>have</i> to get his number. Do you see him? If not, I&rsquo;m going in.&rdquo; Alexia reached over the table to lightly slap the other girl on the arm. Manon bat her hand away with a light flush on her cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? I mean he&rsquo;s cute, but should I really do it?&rdquo; She glanced over at the worker and snapped her eyes away when she caught his eyes. She placed her hand on Lucas beside her and squeezed.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t, you <i>just</i> had a bad date last week.&rdquo; Lucas shrugged and glanced at all the girls who had a confused look on their faces.</p><p>&ldquo;But that means that now she can get over that. Come on Lucas he&rsquo;s <i>gorgeous</i>, this is what Manon <i>needs</i>.&rdquo; Emma squinted as the boy huffed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just <i>saying, </i>maybe she doesn&rsquo;t want a date.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;</i>Are you kidding me Lucas? She&rsquo;s been whining about getting a boyfriend for a month now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; not him, okay?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why not, he&rsquo;s perfect for her!&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i>&ldquo;He <i>is, </i>Lucas. And we needa get this girl a man!&rdquo; Someone beside their table cleared their throat and everyone whipped their head up to see the gorgeous boy standing there with food.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, here&rsquo;s everything for you guys!&rdquo; The worker began setting the stuff on the table when Daphn&eacute; spoke up. &ldquo;We come here all the time, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever seen you? What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>The boy tucked the tray under his arm as he finished setting everything down. &ldquo;Oh, I usually work nights before closing and early mornings. I&rsquo;m Eliott.&rdquo; He flashed his smile and glanced at Manon&rsquo;s side of the table, his smile growing impossibly wider. Emma, Daphn&eacute;, and Alexia practically had hearts in their eyes, Imane raised her eyebrows and chuckled at how ridiculous the girls were being, and Lucas was just quietly scowling at all of them, keeping his eyes away from Eliott. </p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you Eliott, say, our girl Manon over here has just been discussing about how no one seems to want to date her, can you tell her how utter bullshit that is?

Yann said they were from the night before (he\u2019s right), saying that they don\u2019t look too dark yet.

Lucas opens one of them thinking that he\u2019s just being cute and silly, telling Lucas how much he misses him, how good he looked wearing his gym clothes but no.\u00a0</p><p>Lucas closes the picture as soon as he opens it. He tries to quietly look around. Arthur, Basile, and Yann are sitting in front of him, also on their phones, whispering between them, probably still making fun of Lucas now that they can see his whole torso. Lucas just rolls his eyes, giving them one last look and so he looks back at his phone, opening the picture.\u00a0</p><p>The grey t-shirt his boyfriend was using earlier didn\u2019t make Eliott any justice. He looks like perfection, with his shorts way too low, almost\u00a0showing too much, no shirt on, showing his perfect abs, his freckles. Why is he wearing his gym shorts? He should have worn one that was longer so Lucas wouldn\u2019t be able to see his thighs.\u00a0</p><p>Everything, every muscle on Eliott\u2019s body is perfect. He\u2019s definitely\u00a0Lucas\u2019 type. Not too big, not too muscular. He\u2019s long, just the right amount of lean, looking like a Greek god if you ask Lucas.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even work out, he doesn\u2019t need to and Lucas works his ass off at the gym. Or he used to before they started dating.\u00a0</p><p>He only has time to close the photo before Yann snatches the phone from his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYann! Putain, give it back!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sexting, Lulu!\u201d Arthur looks at him, his mouth making a big O.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not! Yann!\u201d His best friend finally gives the phone back and Lucas takes it instantly, putting it inside his bag.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI cannot believe it. You\u2019re such a grown man now. you were a baby just weeks ago and-\u201d<br/></p><p>Lucas rolls his eyes to Yann, everyone is laughing at his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought you had lives to live, girls to make out with, but no, you\u2019ll never get over the fact that I got the hottest guy in town.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I have to agree with you after these pictures.\u201d Lucas knows they wouldn\u2019t open the pictures without permission, but he\u2019s sure they saw at least the previews.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s taken. And I\u2019m his first pick as well, so, too bad for you guys.\u201d<br/></p><p>His friends frown, exchanging a look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?
