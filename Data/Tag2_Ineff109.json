It was odd for Miles to have run off without a word, given he\u2019d spent the past several hours leading Crowley around by the necktie that he let him borrow. A part of Crowley had sort of enjoyed it; thus, he found himself fidgeting with the tie in question as he thought about it, tipping his head back against the wall.

But you\u2019ve got to <i>go</i>, my dear, quickly up the stairs before anyone sees us because I have absolutely <i>no</i> desire to share.\u201d</small></p><p><small>He wasn\u2019t just talking about the wine - or the cake for that matter. It was Crowley who he didn\u2019t particularly feel like sharing with anyone else. Taking the hint, Crowley hurried up the stairs with Miles at his heels, allowing himself to be led down the darkened second-floor gallery and through a corridor, and then another corridor, until they finally found themselves in the library. There was a fire lit, as per the Dowager\u2019s instructions to the few servants who had stayed to keep the house in order while she was in Scotland; she had a terrible fear that, if her books were kept in the cold, the entire library would begin to smell of dampness and mildew. It simply wasn\u2019t a risk she was willing to take.</small></p><p><i><small>All the better for Miles and Crowley.</small></i></p><p><small>Nudging the door shut behind them with the heel of his blue boot, which looked like it belonged on a seventeenth-century French dauphin rather than a rich boy in the 1920s, Miles ventured over to the settee which sat before the fire, setting the plates of cake down before he busied himself with opening the vintage bottle currently in his arms. It was older than both of them put together and then multiplied by two. Making a victorious little sound when he succeeded, he proceeded to pout when he came to a terrible realization.</small></p><p><small>\u201cThe glasses! I\u2019ve gone and forgot the <i>glasses</i>,\u201d he groaned, dropping himself down onto the settee, and Crowley chuckled as he crossed the room to join him. Taking a seat on the floor, giving himself more room to stretch his legs, he took the bottle from Miles\u2019 hands.</small></p><p><small>\u201cNo bother,\u201d he assured him, smirking before putting it to his lips and drinking it straight.</small></p><p><small>His eyes sparkling at the sight, Miles giddily muttered, &ldquo;That<i> is </i>naughty. <i>Terribly </i>naughty. Granny Runcible would have my neck if she saw that.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cGranny Runcible\u2019s not here, is she?\u201d Crowley asked, handing the bottle back to Miles. \u201cBesides, it <i>is</i> your birthday, is it not? Live a little.\u201d</small></p><p><small>Having somebody tell <i>him</i>, the infamous \u201cMiles Malpractice\u201d, to \u201clive a little\u201d was so deliciously rare. Crowley didn\u2019t see him as the raunchy, half-mad party animal that Chatterbox painted him to be; he just saw him as\u2026 a <i>person</i>. A person who played the piano; a person who he wanted to go to the Opera with. Moving to lounge back on the settee, his head pillowed just below the armrest (causing his tiara to tilt precariously) and at the perfect vantage point to face Crowley, who had his back leaned against the sofa, Miles offered him a smile \u2013 not a grin, or a smirk, but a real, <i>proper </i>smile.</small></p><p><small>\u201cOh, I <i>do </i>like you,\u201d he breathed, his eyes shining, and Crowley turned his head to look at Miles; both of their faces were shadowed by the fire\u2019s glow.</small></p><blockquote><p><i><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18050798/chapters/42726467#workskin\" target=\"_blank\"><small>Read the full chapter on AO3</small></a></b></i></p></blockquote>",

Sure, there the seats on the inside are wooden, but they&rsquo;re never able to make it burn that much.</p><p>Aziraphale tuts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that you came to me, though,&rdquo; the angel says. &ldquo;Your back looks really messed up, but I can heal it. I just have to remove all the shards.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>The people had been screaming. Some had run off to fetch some water, but most of them stayed. Among the people standing and watching, was a young woman. Ash was smeared on her face, and her dress was more black than anything. Seemingly headless she was running from person to person, asking if they had seen her daughter.</p><p>Crowley had closed his eyes and concentrated. He hadn&rsquo;t seen the daughter, but he knew where she was. Without a second thought, he went into the burning building. It was just fire, after all.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve removed them all,&rdquo; Aziraphale says. &ldquo;Please take off your shirt, my dear.&rdquo;</p><p>While Crowley struggles to remove the bloody linen, Aziraphale washes his hands and takes a wet cloth.</p><p>Carefully, he starts to wash off the worst of the blood on Crowley&rsquo;s back, constantly checking for forgotten shards.</p><p><br /></p><p>The girl had been in the corner farthest from the door, arms over her head and crying. She couldn&rsquo;t be older than four. &ldquo;Hello, little lady,&rdquo; Crowley said softly and kneeled down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to rescue you.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl looked up at him. &ldquo;Are you &lsquo;n angel?&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley made a face. &ldquo;In a way. I&rsquo;m here to bring you to your mother.&rdquo; Carefully, he took her into his arms and stood up again.</p><p>The girl, realizing that the presence of an &lsquo;angel&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t make the fire go away, buried her face in Crowley&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he soothed her as he walked towards the door, trying to avoid all fires. &ldquo;Just close your eyes. It&rsquo;s all over soon and you&rsquo;ll be with your mother again.&rdquo;</p><p>He hurried up. Despite the fire, this was still a church, and every step hurt his feet. But for the sake of the girl, he tried to walk normally.</p><p><br /></p><p>Aziraphale puts his hands over Crowley&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Oh Lord, heal this-&rdquo; he hesitates. &ldquo;Oh Lord, heal this lost sheep.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley laughs and winces. His wounds closing hurts, or maybe it&rsquo;s the divine power that hurts. Either way, it&rsquo;s still better than being left with an open back.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you so much!&rdquo; The woman cried as she took the girl out of Crowley&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; Crowley waved it off. He was a demon, after all.</p><p>&ldquo;We will include you in our prayers today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; Crowley said. &ldquo;Just&hellip; feed some ducks in my name, that&rsquo;s sufficient.&rdquo;</p><p>Letting the surprised woman stand where she was, and letting her take care of her child, Crowley walked away from the church.</p><p>That was when the glass window exploded, and the shards found their way into Crowley&rsquo;s back.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Aziraphale,&rdquo; Crowley says as Aziraphale washes away the last blood from Crowley&rsquo;s freshly healed back.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mention it, my dear. I&rsquo;m an angel, after all, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re made for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re made for,&rdquo; Crowley repeats and smiles.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>aww, thank you so much &lt;3<br /></p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take off your shirt.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t have set the fire,&rdquo; Aziraphale scolds him as he carefully removes the pieces of glass from Crowley&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought you so stupid to stand that close to a burning building, especially near a window. You could have been discorporated!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Crowley grunts in reply and says nothing. Aziraphale is wrong. He didn&rsquo;t start the fire, he was just passing by. He hadn&rsquo;t even planned to watch or get close to the building. It had been a church, after all. A demon wasn&rsquo;t made for being close to churches.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why, Crowley?&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

The Reign of Terror. Was that one of yours, or one of ours?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it yours?&rdquo; <br/>\n&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t recall. It was quite a good restaurant, though.&rdquo; <br/>\nAs they drove past an astonished traffic warden his notebook spontaneously combusted, to Crowley&rsquo;s amazement. <br/>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty certain I didn&rsquo;t mean to do that,&rdquo; he said.<br/>\n Aziraphale blushed. &ldquo;That was me,&rdquo; he said. <br/>\n&ldquo;I had always thought that your people invented them.&rdquo; <br/>\n&ldquo;Did you? We thought they were yours.&rdquo; Crowley stared at the smoke in the rearview mirror. <br/>\n&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do the Ritz.&rdquo; Crowley had not bothered to book. In his world, table reservations were things that happened to other people.",
