We\u2019re here.\u201d </p><p>Steve stepped out of the car, making his way to the area that Tony had booked. Bucky just sighed following his best friend. He doubted anyone would even show up in his line. Him being there was useless. People will always see him as the winter soldier, that\u2019s just how it will be.</p><p>Once they got to the large open space Bucky took note of which Avengers attended this event. First was Sam Wilson, he had a pile of photos of him in his Falcon suit. Bucky tolled his eyes. \u201cYou looking for a modeling gig?\u201d Bucky smirked, teasing Sam. Sam laughed, a slight glare in his eyes. \u201cMore like a girlfriend!\u201d </p><p>Natsaha hit his shoulder as she sat in her seat next to him. \u201cYou wish!\u201d They started to banter but Bucky left them to it. Next to Nat was Wanda. \u201cHey, Bucky! We\u2019re glad you\u2019re here!\u201d Wanda gave him a thumbs in. Bucky smiled shyily. Then it was Steve\u2019s seat, and of course at the end of the table was Bucky\u2019s seat. </p><p>Steve stood up. \u201cAlright they\u2019re about to come in everyone! Let\u2019s make the best impression!\u201d Then right as he sat back down they filtered in like crazy. Steve got a lot of young girls and little boys in his line. Nat seemed to get a decent amount of teenage boys and girls. Sam got mostly what seemed like the teenagers parents, a few girls, and some little boys. Bucky laughed when Wilson made eye contact with him. Sam made a face of \u2018I will kill you Bucky Barnes\u2019. Wanda got a good mix of everybody. </p><p>Bucky just sat there and sighed, no line for him at all. He told Steve it would be useless. It seemed like two hours had passed and still not a single showed for Bucky showed up. \u201cOnly one hour left.\u201d He mumbled to himself. A mantra he had been chanting to himself for the past hour. </p><p>Bucky has his feet up on the table and his eyes closed when Steve roughed pushed his shoulder. Bucky opened his eyes to punch him back but his eyes went straight to you. Coming up his empty line bounced a smiling girl. Bucky guessed you couldn\u2019t of been older than 25. </p><p>Steve smirked at the look on his best friends face. Once you got close enough to the table to talk to Bucky, your happy going exterior dropped. \u201cHi.\u201d You said in a small voice. Bucky could not believe it. Someone was in his line. They seemed excited to see him. </p><p>Bucky realized he was staring, shaking his head out of it. \u201cOh, H-Hello.\u201d Bucky wanted to face palm himself. You smiled sweetly at him. \u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d You stuck your hand out for him to shake. You hoped he wouldn\u2019t notice how badly it was shaking. Looking down at your hand for a few minutes too long, Steve elbowed Bucky snapping him back into reality. </p><p>He slowly wrapped his large calloused hand around your small one. He could tell just by looking at you, if the wind blew too hard you would get swept away. For some reason he wanted to protect you. Bucky was spacing out while staring at you again. That would be the second time since you got here.</p><p>You tried to pull your hand away but he had a good grip. Your whole face turned red. \u201cJames?\u201d Your voice sounded distant to Bucky but he answered. \u201cCall me Bucky.\u201d His voice deep and gravelly as he pulled his hand back. How can someone\u2019s voice be so&hellip;sexy? You blushed even harder at your thoughts. </p><p>\u201cSo Y/N, is there anything you want to talk about, or want?\u201d Bucky knew that with that adorably pink face he wanted to just leave kisses all over it. \u201cOh, um.\u201d You stopped talking to reach into your purse. Bucky blinked a few times, surprised at what you pulled out. I\u2019m your hands was one of his T-shirts that Tony sells. It was white with an outline of him on it. </p><p>\u201cC-Could you sign this?\u201d You shakily handed it over. Bucky blushed slightly. You smiled at this. He quickly signed it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know people bought this stuff.\u201d Bucky chuckled, handing it back. Your face lit up at this. \u201cReally? I love this stuff!\u201d Bucky smiled. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s so cool that you guys go out and save the world. I could never do anything like that. Not to mention, all the stuff you went through and you still have hope to help people. You are pretty handsome too.\u201d You didn\u2019t realize you were ranting until the handsome part slipped out. Your face turned beat red.</p><p>Bucky had slight pink cheeks. Steve looked out of the corner of his eye and chuckled. Bucky slapped his leg underneath the table. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty cute.\u201d Bucky chuckled, not realizing where all this confidence came from. That statement alone made you a stuttering mess. </p><p>\u201cOh, t-thank y-you.\u201d Bucky couldn\u2019t help but notice how beautiful your eyes were. They seemed to shine in the light. Bucky was still feeling confident and he wanted to ride this confidence. \u201cHow about we get some coffee tomorrow morning?\u201d </p><p>\u201cR-Really?\u201d Bucky laughed. It was wonderful to hear. \u201cYeah, just let me give you my number.\u201d You nodded pulling out your phone, and handing it to him. He walked around the table handing it to you. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow at 8?\u201d You smiled the biggest smile ever. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow!\u201d \u201cBucky it\u2019s time to go.\u201d Steve interrupted. Only then did you notice everyone else was gone. \u201cAlright, Cap.\u201d Bucky turned to you, leaning down giving you a peck on the cheek. \u201cText me.\u201d Bucky smiled. As he left you stood there holding your cheek. You have a date with the Bucky Barnes. </p><p>Today couldn\u2019t of been better. </p>",

You smiled sweetly at him. \u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d You stuck your hand out for him to shake. You hoped he wouldn\u2019t notice how badly it was shaking. Looking down at your hand for a few minutes too long, Steve elbowed Bucky snapping him back into reality. </p><p>He slowly wrapped his large calloused hand around your small one. He could tell just by looking at you, if the wind blew too hard you would get swept away. For some reason he wanted to protect you. Bucky was spacing out while staring at you again. That would be the second time since you got here.</p><p>You tried to pull your hand away but he had a good grip. Your whole face turned red. \u201cJames?\u201d Your voice sounded distant to Bucky but he answered. \u201cCall me Bucky.\u201d His voice deep and gravelly as he pulled his hand back. How can someone\u2019s voice be so\u2026sexy? You blushed even harder at your thoughts. </p><p>\u201cSo Y/N, is there anything you want to talk about, or want?\u201d Bucky knew that with that adorably pink face he wanted to just leave kisses all over it. \u201cOh, um.\u201d You stopped talking to reach into your purse. Bucky blinked a few times, surprised at what you pulled out. I\u2019m your hands was one of his T-shirts that Tony sells. It was white with an outline of him on it. </p><p>\u201cC-Could you sign this?\u201d You shakily handed it over. Bucky blushed slightly. You smiled at this. He quickly signed it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know people bought this stuff.\u201d Bucky chuckled, handing it back. Your face lit up at this. \u201cReally? I love this stuff!\u201d Bucky smiled. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s so cool that you guys go out and save the world. I could never do anything like that. Not to mention, all the stuff you went through and you still have hope to help people. You are pretty handsome too.\u201d You didn\u2019t realize you were ranting until the handsome part slipped out. Your face turned beat red.</p><p>Bucky had slight pink cheeks. Steve looked out of the corner of his eye and chuckled. Bucky slapped his leg underneath the table. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty cute.\u201d Bucky chuckled, not realizing where all this confidence came from. That statement alone made you a stuttering mess. </p><p>\u201cOh, t-thank y-you.\u201d Bucky couldn\u2019t help but notice how beautiful your eyes were. They seemed to shine in the light. Bucky was still feeling confident and he wanted to ride this confidence. \u201cHow about we get some coffee tomorrow morning?\u201d </p><p>\u201cR-Really?\u201d Bucky laughed. It was wonderful to hear. \u201cYeah, just let me give you my number.\u201d You nodded pulling out your phone, and handing it to him. He walked around the table handing it to you. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow at 8?\u201d You smiled the biggest smile ever. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow!\u201d \u201cBucky it\u2019s time to go.\u201d Steve interrupted. Only then did you notice everyone else was gone. \u201cAlright, Cap.\u201d Bucky turned to you, leaning down giving you a peck on the cheek. \u201cText me.\u201d Bucky smiled. As he left you stood there holding your cheek. You have a date with the Bucky Barnes. </p><p>Today couldn\u2019t of been better. </p>",
