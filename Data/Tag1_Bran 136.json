So instead of the WW being a representation of climate change per se, GRRM\u2019s commentary is based on the characters\u2019 dismissal of their existence in the same way factions in our own society try to dismiss climate change as an actual, life-threatening problem.\u00a0</p><p>But yes, I agree, the dragons and the WWs are both representatives of extremes and are equally destructive just that in opposite ways (WW with ice; Dragons with fire).

        "question": "I enjoyed your Prophecies ask.  Any thought to Jaime being valonqar via Bran warging into him?  Both would meet the younger brother aspect of her or YMBQ's. I see Cersei's death as very personal.  Bran getting retribution for Broken Tower on having Jaime kill Cersei seems very fitting both for Jaime (making him live with doing this because I'm not sure if he could do it on his own) and obv Cersei. Two birds.  He's one of the only main characters who has not gotten to slay his own demons.",
        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>Thank you. :)</p><p>I know that Bran being the valonqar through warging is a theory that has recently began circulating. The first meta I read on the subject is from <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and she makes some interesting points. So I would definitely not dismiss it outright.\u00a0</p><p>However, I don\u2019t particularly ascribe to this theory and less so to Bran warging Jaime specifically. In a narrative sense, I think it would be a cop out to simultaneously have Jaime kill Cersei but not really because it\u2019s actually Bran doing it. I think with the idea of Jaime as the valonqar, the only way to make it effective, personal and for it to have the tragic narrative impact that I believe such a plot twist would have is to fully commit to it and have Jaime kill her for his own reasons, reasons that should not, by the way, be connected to Brienne in any way.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know if you are familiar with Pascal Bruckner\u2019s\u00a0\u201cLunes de fiel\u201d. In essence that book is about a couple involved in the most extreme version of a toxic relationship you can imagine and the ending of it finds both of them crippled and disfigured at each other\u2019s hands. In a way that\u2019s how I see the Jaime/Cersei relationship. There is love there but they also hurt and use each other in abhorrent ways so the Jaime as the valonqar theory feels like the satisfying end to their relationship. It\u2019s personal, it\u2019s painful, it\u2019s the toxic end to a relationship that has harmed and twisted both of them.

                "content": "<p>\n\nSecond picture in a long term ASOIAF fan art project. This illustration is based on the following passage from Bran VI in A Game of Thrones, by George R. R. Martin (1996) -<br /><br />&ldquo;Summer lapped at the water and settled down at Bran&rsquo;s side. He rubbed the wolf under the jaw, and for a moment boy and beast both felt at peace. Bran had always liked the godswood, even before, but of late he found himself drawn to it more and more. Even the heart tree no longer scared him the way it used to. The deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him, yet somehow he took comfort from that now. The gods were looking over him, he told himself; the old gods, gods of the Starks and the First Men and the children of the forest, his father&rsquo;s gods. He felt safe in their sight, and the deep silence of the trees helped him think. Bran had been thinking a lot since his fall; thinking, and dreaming, and talking with the gods.&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p>",
