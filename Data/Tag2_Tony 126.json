Tony is a man who is willing to sacrifice himself to save humanity. This gave him PTSD and anxiety. Tony nearly lost his girlfriend in an attack on his house by a terrorist, and later, in a fire. Tony lost the boy he saw as a son. He practically died in Tony\u2019s arms.</p><p>You think Tony is an arrogant asshole ? His laughs and sarcasm are his mask and his way of dealing with emotions.</p><p>Steve Rogers: Steve lost his parents, had a countless number of diseases, had to fight everyday to survive. Steve lost his best friend when he fell from a train, when he became a Hydra soldier, and when he turned to ashes. Steve never got his dance with Peggy. When he woke up, she was an old wowan, who died soon after. Steve had to fight against his friend Tony to protect his friend Bucky.</p><p>You think Steve is a jerk for fighting Tony ? He was trying to protect the ONLY thing connected to his previous life, his best friend. Everything he did, he did it for Bucky.</p><p>Thor: Thor&hellip; Thor lost his brother so many times&hellip; He lost his mother, he lost his father, his planet was destroyed. He lost his sister. You might think he won\u2019t miss her, but she was part of his familly, and family ALWAYS matters. And finally, when he thought everything was going to be alright&hellip; A mad Titan killed all of the Asgardians, including Thor\u2019s brother and his best friend.</p><p>You think Thor is the goofy Avenger who does nothing but swing his hammer ? Maybe he was thaat guy. But look at him now, and tell me if you feel the same way.</p><p>Bruce Banner: Bruce has sometimes absolutely no control on what is going on. Hulk takes his place and he is forced to stand behind and watch what the monster is doing. Bruce tried to kill himself. He was so done with his life that he decided to end it. But he can\u2019t. He HAS to live. Every day is a struggle against the Hulk. He is more famous for being the Hulk than for being a professor with MULTIPLE PhDs.</p><p>You think Bruce is shy, clumsy and weak ? Tony didn\u2019t name him the strongest Avenger because they are science bros. He truly considers him as the strongest Avenger.</p><p>Natasha Romanov: Natasha&hellip; Natasha was raised as a killer, as an assassin, as a murderer. She says she has red on her ledger, that she wants to wipe it out, but she knows all that blood can\u2019t just get away. She thought she had finally found a family with the Avengers, but then, her lover left and the team got torn apart and she had to choose her side. She had to fight her best friend, her mentor, the man who saved her from her previous life. But she couldn\u2019t do that. So she chose her own side and helped Steve and Bucky so they could get away.</p><p>You think Natasha is a cold, manipulative liar ? She was brainwashed to be this way when she was a child. And now she is using that for fighting against people like the ones who trained her and turned her, according to her opinion, into a monster. She is fighting to be a good person.</p><p>Clint Barton: Clint is seen by many people as the weakest member of the Avengers. He fights with only a bow and arrows. He got mind-controlled by Loki. He killed DOZENS of people under his control, probably friends, at least colleagues. He even fought his best friend, and he fought to KILL her. Clint is only alive because a kid sacrificed himself for him, right in front of his eyes. He probably wasn\u2019t able to protect his family from the Decimation. Because he didn\u2019t go on the battlefield. And he hates himself for it.</p><p>You think Clint is useless ? This guy nearly managed to bring down a whole freaking helicarrier, using only TWO arrows, and it didn\u2019t crash only because two of the most liked characters (aka Steve and Tony) found a way to fix one of the engines. This archer wass supposed to watch over the Tesseract. And guess what he did ? He did what a whole bunch of scientists couldn\u2019t do: he figured out that the cube was a door that could be opened from both sides. He is the only Avenger who ever manage to get a life stable enough to get a wife and KIDS. When he heard that Wanda was locked up, he dropped EVERYTHING to get her out. Because this wasn\u2019t fair. He recruited a master assassin he was supposed to kill, a super powerful witch, and a tiny guy who might be the answer against Thanos. And finally, when was the only battle the Avengers lost ? Oh right, the one where Clint wasn\u2019t&hellip;</p>",
