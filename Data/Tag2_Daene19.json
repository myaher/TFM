Behind a silver horse the bloody corpse of a naked man bounced and dragged. <b>A white lion ran through grass taller than a man.</b> Beneath the Mother of Mountains, a line of naked crones crept from a great lake and knelt shivering before her, their grey heads bowed. Ten thousand slaves lifted bloodstained hands as she raced by on her silver, riding like the wind. \u201cMother!\u201d they cried. \u201cMother, mother!\u201d (Daenerys IV, <i>ACOK</i>)</p></blockquote><p>These are all out of order moments in Daenerys\u2019 life, but they\u2019re significant mostly to her character and her growth. The warning Quaithe gives her is different:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The glass candles are burning.

Beware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d (Daenerys II, <i>ADWD</i>)</p></blockquote><p>The lion in this instance is Tyrion, just as Jon Connington is the griffin and Victarion the kraken (though Euron could also be considered for the role).</p><p>I would say the warning not to trust any of these figures stems from the fact that, for all of them, Daenerys is a means to an end. We know Quentyn, the\u00a0\u201csun\u2019s son\u201d, is a decent person, but he himself acknowledges that he doesn\u2019t love or even really <i>want</i> Dany. He\u2019s there for fire and blood, just like the others.</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s goals are similar. He wants Daenerys to bring fire and blood to Westeros, to his family, to the people who put him on trial and cheered for his death. He\u2019s not in a good place in <i>ADWD</i>, or in his <i>TWOW</i> sample chapter, and that is very likely to influence the advice he gives Daenerys.</p><p>Beyond that, it\u2019s difficult to say why Quaithe tells Dany any of this. Previously, it seemed GRRM was trying to get her to Asshai, but ultimately the books didn\u2019t take that direction.

After the war against Cersei is done she is crowned queen of the five kingdoms (-the north and the iron islands) and marries Jon. In their last scene together a bump is visible on her belly indicating that she is pregnant with their first child. Rheagal never dies. </p><p>Jon:  Kills the Night King. Accepts his identity as both a Targaryen and a Stark and rules in KL with his wife. Ghost dislikes the warm weather but after a good shave and a personal swimming pool he\u2019s fine. </p><p>Sansa: QITN! QITN! QITN! </p><p>Arya: Sails west but eventually returns to Westeros. Settles down at Storm\u2019s End and marries Gendry. Visits her remaining family regularly. Alternatively traveling the world with Gendry.</p><p>Bran: Becomes a higher power or a tree or something Idk. The writers fucked him up. Perhaps it would be nice if he married Meera and reclaimed his humanity somehow. Or stayed in WF with Sansa. </p><p>Cersei: Strangled by Jaime after she wants to burn down KL with wildfire. </p><p>Jaime: Sleeps with Brienne after the Battle of Winterfell but leaves for KL after he hears about his sister\u2019s plans. He promises Brienne to come back to her afterwards and admits that he loves her. She accepts but eventually changes her mind and decides to go after him. After Cersei is killed he gets stabbed by Euron but manages to stay alive long enough for Brienne to find him. He dies in her arms.</p><p>Tyrion: The writers have done him dirty since season 4. They completely messed up his character by putting him in the background. In later seasons the only things he does is crack stupid jokes and fuck up Dany\u2019s plans. And since he has proven to be such a shitty hand (remember the <i>seven</i> years, anyone??) It would\u2019ve left a bitter taste in my mouth seeing him continue to serve the queen. I guess it would\u2019ve been kind of nice seeing him make his own wine in some distant corner of the world but I would\u2019ve been just as fine with him dying too. </p><p>Sam: Grand Maester and happily married to Gilly.</p><p>Missandei &amp; Greyworm: Alive and still part of Dany\u2019s squad. Going on occasional vacations to Naarth. </p><p>Jorah: Serves as Dany\u2019s new hand.</p><p>Theon: Sansa\u2019s Hand and not so secret lover. She wants to marry him but he doesn\u2019t want to be king. Perhaps he will agree to it one day. Hero of Winterfell. Forgiven by everyone. Forms a close friendship with Pod. If anyone deserved a happy ending it was Theon. (And Sansa) </p><p>Brienne: After Jaime, she returns to the north to serve as Sansa\u2019s Queen\u2019s Guard. Perhaps she maybe possibly probably starts to like Tormund after some time has gone by. Just a bit.</p><p>Podrick: Becomes ser Podrick Payne. Stays with Brienne and Sansa. Hangs out with Theon.</p><p>Davos: Master of Ships. Jon\u2019s most trusted adviser.</p><p>Bronn: Gets his damn castle I suppose. I couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Qyburn: Killed by the Mountain. I loved Qyburn\u2019s death. His experiment was too bold in the end indeed. </p><p>Yara: Queen of the Iron Islands. Visits Theon regularly in Winterfell. Mainly to tease him about Sansa. </p><p>Sandor: Dies fighting and killing the Mountain.</p><p>Euron: killed by Jaime or Yara/Theon.</p><p>Melisandre: Dies during the battle of Winterfell.</p>",
