He\u2019d promised to have his mum around for ages, and when she finally insisted he panicked a little. Phil seemed much calmer, he looked over and offered a smile brightly as he wiped his hand on a towel. \u201cHello Mrs Howell, it\u2019s lovely to see you again.\u201d He smiled charmingly and hugged her. \u201cI\u2019m making chicken casserole, I hope that\u2019s alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello again Philip, that sounds lovely, smells lovely too!\u201d She smiled at the man warmly, seeing his eyes flick up to Dan for just a moment before turning back to food. Curious.</p><p>Dan began to set the table, \u201cWhat would you like to drink Mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat wine do you boys have stashed away?\u201d She asked cheekily. Dan smiled, \u201cThree glasses coming right up.\u201d He slid past Phil reaching for the glasses.</p><p>Phil smiled and grabbed one of their nicer bottles from cupboard beside Dan, and a bottle opener from the drawer, moving around him.</p><p>They moved easily around the kitchen together, and it didn\u2019t slip past Dan\u2019s Mum. She watched them, eyes fixing on Phil and taking note, he was a handsome man, and sweet too. She\u2019d had her suspicions about Dan for a while now, regarding his sexuality. She\u2019d always assumed he\u2019d tell her when he was ready.</p><p>Phil thanked him with a smile when Dan passed him his glass, taking a sip and Dan placed the other two glasses on the table, taking a seat beside his mum. \u201cSo what do you think of the apartment?\u201d</p><p>She hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s lovely how you two have decorated, made the place your own.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he put the lid on the pot and left it to simmer, taking a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s your jobs going boys? Still as successful as ever?\u201d She couldn\u2019t always keep up with the projects they had on at any one time, but she supported her son, he needed that from her.</p><p>Phil smiled warmly, \u201cThey\u2019re going well. We just finished touring a couple of months back, and we\u2019ve got some projects lined up into the new year.\u201d</p><p>She smiled widely, \u201cOh yes Daniel, you told me about that! So what have you got coming up?\u201d</p><p>Phil happily rhymed off a list of projects they&rsquo;d be doing soon, a proud smile on his lips. Dan chimed in every moment or so with comments about a project excitedly. They bounced off each other as they talked to her about work so easily, both shining with excitement. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen Dan as comfortable talking to someone as he was right now.</p><p>Phil stood to check on the food when the timer on his phone when off, stirring it and tasting it as he went. It seems almost second nature when Dan stood up and set out some plates ready for Phil to dish up, \u201cWant some help?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he looked over, \u201cYeah, that would be great.\u201d He turned off the gas, giving the casserole a final stir.</p><p>Dan and Phil flitted around each other until three hot plates of fantastic smelling casserole sat on the table and they took their seats. Mrs Howell watched them, a small smile on her face. \u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked when he caught her looking, she just shook her head.</p><p>Phil gave her a warm smile but said nothing, taking his seat. \u201cHopefully you like it Mrs Howell, Dan said it was a favourite of yours.\u201d She smiled brightly at that, \u201cIt smells wonderful Philip, thank you.\u201d Dan just grinned, proudly.</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d Phil smiled happily, before tucking into his plate.</p><hr><p>They ate in silence for a moment, aside from low groans of appreciation. Eventually Mrs Howell addressed Phil curiously, \u201cSo how\u2019d you take my boy as a roommate, he was always a little hopeless at home.\u201d Dan scowled, \u201cMuuuum.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled softly, \u201cHe\u2019s actually pretty good around here. It took a little trial and error but we make it work. I usually cook and deal with stuff like bills, and he usually makes the place look nice and organised. We take turns with the laundry as we both hate the task equally.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Dan flushed at his mum looked at him impressed. \u201cHmm, I could never make my Daniel do anything, what\u2019s your secret?\u201d Dan blushed scarlet, looking stubbornly at his food.</p><p>Phil kept his cool, smiling at her across the table. \u201cI think we just bounce really well off each other, we both want to live in a nice, clean place so we both pitch in. Keeps everything friendly, no silly fights!\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although Dan\u2019s discomfort made her feel as if that wasn\u2019t the whole truth. Dan looked at Phil sheepishly, apology in his eyes. But Phil simply gave him a reaffirming smile, he knew a parent wiggling for information when he saw one.</p><p>\u201cDan tells me you love dogs, does your contract allow pets? You two would be so good looking after a dog.\u201d She smiled softly. Dan shook his head, \u201cNo pets here sadly.\u201d</p><p>Phil gave a playfully pout, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, I would love a dog.\u201d Dan smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll get one in future, a corgi-shibe cross remember?\u201d \u00a0Phil smiled brightly, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name ready?\u201d Mrs Howell asked with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve went back and forth, Loki is one we likes lot.\u201d Phil smiled as Dan nodded, \u201cWe argued plenty over that one.\u201d He finished off his meal sitting back with a satisfied sigh. \u201cHmm thanks Phil, that was amazing.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, \u201cLoki is a great name for a dog!\u201d He chuckled as he stood, and cleared the three (now completely empty) plates. \u201cThey don\u2019t call me AmazingPhil for nothing.\u201d He quipped.</p><p>Dan snorted and his mum laughed softly, \u201cOne more glass and I should be heading home.\u201d She offered, so Dan poured her one, \u201cYes of course, it was lovely to have you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you boys got planned for tonight then?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he put the dishes in the sink, before returning to his seat and taking a sip from his glass. \u201cProbably cleaning up the dishes, then watch a movie or play Mario Kart.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThe usual.\u201d Dan smiled at Phil.</p><p>\u201cVery domestic.\u201d She commented cheekily.</p><p>Phil chuckled softly, but said nothing in protest as it would only confirm her suspicions.</p><hr><p>They finished their drinks and Dan stood to walk his mum to her car, \u201cBe back soon Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It was lovely to see you again Mrs Howell!\u201d Phil waved goodbye.</p><p>The moment they were out of earshot of Phil Mrs Howell struck. \u201cHe\u2019s a very handsome boy.\u201d</p><p>Dan glanced at her suspiciously, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nothing, just wondering you know.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, \u201cMum no, we\u2019re roommates and that\u2019s all.\u201d His Mum watched him for a moment. \u201cI think I left something in the sitting room I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes but let her go. She was smiling when she returned. \u201cAll ready!\u201d He shook his head, \u201cCome on then.\u201d</p><p>They walked out to the car and she pulled him into a tight hug. \u201cHave a good night honey, I\u2019ll see you again soon I\u2019m sure!\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Inside, Phil busied himself cleaning, unaware of Mrs Howell\u2019s questions of her son but inwardly pleased with how smoothly the evening had gone.</p><p>Dan watched her drive away and sighed with relief. He wondered back inside and into the warm kitchen, wrapping his arms around Phil\u2019s waist and dropping his head onto his shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s too damn perceptive sometimes.\u201d He muttered tiredly.</p><p>Phil hummed and leaned his head onto Dan\u2019s, \u201cDid she try and question you again?\u201d Dan nodded, \u201cWanna kiss.\u201d He whined miserably, \u201cHaven\u2019t all day.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled fondly and wrapped his arms around Dan, \u201cC\u2019mere you.\u201d He pulled him in softly and kissed him.</p><p>Dan hummed happily, they kissed lazily for a moment before Dan tucked his head into Phil\u2019s neck. \u201cLove you, thanks for today.\u201d</p><p>Phil rubbed his back softly, \u201cLove you too. Anything for you baby.\u201d</p><p>Dan kissed his neck, \u201cLet me help you finish up the dishes.\u201d Phil hummed, and squeezed his waist. \u201cI\u2019ve got these, you go relax, you look tired.\u201d</p><p>Dan pouted, \u201cBut you did all the cooking!\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled softly and caved, letting Dan help by drying the dishes as he washed them, then together they put everything away.</p><p>Once done Dan immediately snuggled into Phil again, \u201cMovie then bed?\u201d He suggested with a yawn.</p><p>Phil nodded and snuggled him in. \u201cMovie in bed?\u201d He counter offered sweetly.</p><p>Dan smiled, \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><hr><p>It was a week later when Phil spoke up about something he\u2019d notice. He\u2019d searched the kitchen top to bottom, and it was nowhere to be seen. \u201cHey baby? Have you seen our silver serving platter? I haven\u2019t seen it since last week.\u201d He asked, as he looked across at Dan.</p><p>Dan looked up from the book he\u2019d been reading, \u201cHuh? No, have you searched the kitchen? Or it might be in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve searched the kitchen, and in the dining room. Your mum wouldn\u2019t have&hellip; borrowed it, would she?\u201d Phil knew she wouldn\u2019t intentionally take it, maybe Dan had leant it to her and forgot.</p><p>Dan frowned, \u201cWhy would she have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! It\u2019s just weird, I\u2019ll check again,\u201d He pecked Dan\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Dan watched him go, then pulled out his phone and sent a message to him Mum.</p><p>\u2018Hey Mum, you didn\u2019t accidentally take our silver platter did you? We can\u2019t find it.\u2019</p><p>A few moments later, Dan got a response.</p><p>\u2018Hello Daniel. Now I\u2019m not saying that you do sleep with Philip, and I\u2019m not saying that you don\u2019t, but you know I love you and couldn\u2019t care less either way. But nonetheless, if Philip was sleeping in his own bed, he would have found the platter under his pillow. When are the two of you coming for dinner?\u2019</p><p>Dan\u2019s jaw dropped, his expression comical as Phil came back into the room, saying something about it definitely not being there. Phil tilted his head, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d His voice was amused.</p><p>Dan looked up, \u201cShe- oh my god, Phil she hid it under your pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did not! Really?\u201d Phil jogged upstairs and sure enough, he found the platter tucked under one of the pillows of his bed in the filming room. He brought it back downstairs, and shook his head. \u201cWell, at least we know where your quick wit comes from.\u201d</p><p>Dan stared at it, \u201cShe- she wants to know when we\u2019re going around for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? We us, or we Dan and Phil?\u201d He asked curiously, sitting beside him. \u201cWe us.\u201d Dan wasn\u2019t really sure what to think right now.</p><p>Phil smiled softly and pulled Dan carefully into his lap, wrapping his arms affectionately around him. \u201cWe\u2019re free this weekend.\u201d He pecked Dan\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Dan pressed his head into Phil\u2019s neck. \u201cI just came out to my Mum- oh my god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cAnd clearly your mum loves You regardless.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up, he was right. He shuffled a little, \u201cYou said we\u2019re free this weekend?\u201d Phil nodded, \u201cWe could do Saturday?\u201d He offered with a content hum.</p><p>Dan nodded, settling into his lap with a sigh. \u201cYeah, yeah okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed his head, letting him relax and process.</p><p>That had been easier than expected, and it looked like things were going to be just fine.<br/></p>",

He\u2019d promised to have his mum around for ages, and when she finally insisted he panicked a little. Phil seemed much calmer, he looked over and offered a smile brightly as he wiped his hand on a towel. \u201cHello Mrs Howell, it\u2019s lovely to see you again.\u201d He smiled charmingly and hugged her. \u201cI\u2019m making chicken casserole, I hope that\u2019s alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello again Philip, that sounds lovely, smells lovely too!\u201d She smiled at the man warmly, seeing his eyes flick up to Dan for just a moment before turning back to food. Curious.</p><p>Dan began to set the table, \u201cWhat would you like to drink Mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat wine do you boys have stashed away?\u201d She asked cheekily. Dan smiled, \u201cThree glasses coming right up.\u201d He slid past Phil reaching for the glasses.</p><p>Phil smiled and grabbed one of their nicer bottles from cupboard beside Dan, and a bottle opener from the drawer, moving around him.</p><p>They moved easily around the kitchen together, and it didn\u2019t slip past Dan\u2019s Mum. She watched them, eyes fixing on Phil and taking note, he was a handsome man, and sweet too. She\u2019d had her suspicions about Dan for a while now, regarding his sexuality. She\u2019d always assumed he\u2019d tell her when he was ready.</p><p>Phil thanked him with a smile when Dan passed him his glass, taking a sip and Dan placed the other two glasses on the table, taking a seat beside his mum. \u201cSo what do you think of the apartment?\u201d</p><p>She hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s lovely how you two have decorated, made the place your own.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he put the lid on the pot and left it to simmer, taking a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s your jobs going boys? Still as successful as ever?\u201d She couldn\u2019t always keep up with the projects they had on at any one time, but she supported her son, he needed that from her.</p><p>Phil smiled warmly, \u201cThey\u2019re going well. We just finished touring a couple of months back, and we\u2019ve got some projects lined up into the new year.\u201d</p><p>She smiled widely, \u201cOh yes Daniel, you told me about that! So what have you got coming up?\u201d</p><p>Phil happily rhymed off a list of projects they\u2019d be doing soon, a proud smile on his lips. Dan chimed in every moment or so with comments about a project excitedly. They bounced off each other as they talked to her about work so easily, both shining with excitement. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen Dan as comfortable talking to someone as he was right now.</p><p>Phil stood to check on the food when the timer on his phone when off, stirring it and tasting it as he went. It seems almost second nature when Dan stood up and set out some plates ready for Phil to dish up, \u201cWant some help?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he looked over, \u201cYeah, that would be great.\u201d He turned off the gas, giving the casserole a final stir.</p><p>Dan and Phil flitted around each other until three hot plates of fantastic smelling casserole sat on the table and they took their seats. Mrs Howell watched them, a small smile on her face. \u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked when he caught her looking, she just shook her head.</p><p>Phil gave her a warm smile but said nothing, taking his seat. \u201cHopefully you like it Mrs Howell, Dan said it was a favourite of yours.\u201d She smiled brightly at that, \u201cIt smells wonderful Philip, thank you.\u201d Dan just grinned, proudly.</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d Phil smiled happily, before tucking into his plate.</p><hr><p>They ate in silence for a moment, aside from low groans of appreciation. Eventually Mrs Howell addressed Phil curiously, \u201cSo how\u2019d you take my boy as a roommate, he was always a little hopeless at home.\u201d Dan scowled, \u201cMuuuum.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled softly, \u201cHe\u2019s actually pretty good around here. It took a little trial and error but we make it work. I usually cook and deal with stuff like bills, and he usually makes the place look nice and organised. We take turns with the laundry as we both hate the task equally.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Dan flushed at his mum looked at him impressed. \u201cHmm, I could never make my Daniel do anything, what\u2019s your secret?\u201d Dan blushed scarlet, looking stubbornly at his food.</p><p>Phil kept his cool, smiling at her across the table. \u201cI think we just bounce really well off each other, we both want to live in a nice, clean place so we both pitch in. Keeps everything friendly, no silly fights!\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although Dan\u2019s discomfort made her feel as if that wasn\u2019t the whole truth. Dan looked at Phil sheepishly, apology in his eyes. But Phil simply gave him a reaffirming smile, he knew a parent wiggling for information when he saw one.</p><p>\u201cDan tells me you love dogs, does your contract allow pets? You two would be so good looking after a dog.\u201d She smiled softly. Dan shook his head, \u201cNo pets here sadly.\u201d</p><p>Phil gave a playfully pout, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, I would love a dog.\u201d Dan smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll get one in future, a corgi-shibe cross remember?\u201d \u00a0Phil smiled brightly, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name ready?\u201d Mrs Howell asked with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve went back and forth, Loki is one we likes lot.\u201d Phil smiled as Dan nodded, \u201cWe argued plenty over that one.\u201d He finished off his meal sitting back with a satisfied sigh. \u201cHmm thanks Phil, that was amazing.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, \u201cLoki is a great name for a dog!\u201d He chuckled as he stood, and cleared the three (now completely empty) plates. \u201cThey don\u2019t call me AmazingPhil for nothing.\u201d He quipped.</p><p>Dan snorted and his mum laughed softly, \u201cOne more glass and I should be heading home.\u201d She offered, so Dan poured her one, \u201cYes of course, it was lovely to have you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you boys got planned for tonight then?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he put the dishes in the sink, before returning to his seat and taking a sip from his glass. \u201cProbably cleaning up the dishes, then watch a movie or play Mario Kart.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThe usual.\u201d Dan smiled at Phil.</p><p>\u201cVery domestic.\u201d She commented cheekily.</p><p>Phil chuckled softly, but said nothing in protest as it would only confirm her suspicions.</p><hr><p>They finished their drinks and Dan stood to walk his mum to her car, \u201cBe back soon Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.

He\u2019d promised to have his mum around for ages, and when she finally insisted he panicked a little. Phil seemed much calmer, he looked over and offered a smile brightly as he wiped his hand on a towel. \u201cHello Mrs Howell, it\u2019s lovely to see you again.\u201d He smiled charmingly and hugged her. \u201cI\u2019m making chicken casserole, I hope that\u2019s alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello again Philip, that sounds lovely, smells lovely too!\u201d She smiled at the man warmly, seeing his eyes flick up to Dan for just a moment before turning back to food. Curious.</p><p>Dan began to set the table, \u201cWhat would you like to drink Mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat wine do you boys have stashed away?\u201d She asked cheekily. Dan smiled, \u201cThree glasses coming right up.\u201d He slid past Phil reaching for the glasses.</p><p>Phil smiled and grabbed one of their nicer bottles from cupboard beside Dan, and a bottle opener from the drawer, moving around him.</p><p>They moved easily around the kitchen together, and it didn\u2019t slip past Dan\u2019s Mum. She watched them, eyes fixing on Phil and taking note, he was a handsome man, and sweet too. She\u2019d had her suspicions about Dan for a while now, regarding his sexuality. She\u2019d always assumed he\u2019d tell her when he was ready.</p><p>Phil thanked him with a smile when Dan passed him his glass, taking a sip and Dan placed the other two glasses on the table, taking a seat beside his mum. \u201cSo what do you think of the apartment?\u201d</p><p>She hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s lovely how you two have decorated, made the place your own.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he put the lid on the pot and left it to simmer, taking a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s your jobs going boys? Still as successful as ever?\u201d She couldn\u2019t always keep up with the projects they had on at any one time, but she supported her son, he needed that from her.</p><p>Phil smiled warmly, \u201cThey\u2019re going well. We just finished touring a couple of months back, and we\u2019ve got some projects lined up into the new year.\u201d</p><p>She smiled widely, \u201cOh yes Daniel, you told me about that! So what have you got coming up?\u201d</p><p>Phil happily rhymed off a list of projects they\u2019d be doing soon, a proud smile on his lips. Dan chimed in every moment or so with comments about a project excitedly. They bounced off each other as they talked to her about work so easily, both shining with excitement. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen Dan as comfortable talking to someone as he was right now.</p><p>Phil stood to check on the food when the timer on his phone when off, stirring it and tasting it as he went. It seems almost second nature when Dan stood up and set out some plates ready for Phil to dish up, \u201cWant some help?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he looked over, \u201cYeah, that would be great.\u201d He turned off the gas, giving the casserole a final stir.</p><p>Dan and Phil flitted around each other until three hot plates of fantastic smelling casserole sat on the table and they took their seats. Mrs Howell watched them, a small smile on her face. \u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked when he caught her looking, she just shook her head.</p><p>Phil gave her a warm smile but said nothing, taking his seat. \u201cHopefully you like it Mrs Howell, Dan said it was a favourite of yours.\u201d She smiled brightly at that, \u201cIt smells wonderful Philip, thank you.\u201d Dan just grinned, proudly.</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d Phil smiled happily, before tucking into his plate.</p><hr><p>They ate in silence for a moment, aside from low groans of appreciation. Eventually Mrs Howell addressed Phil curiously, \u201cSo how\u2019d you take my boy as a roommate, he was always a little hopeless at home.\u201d Dan scowled, \u201cMuuuum.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled softly, \u201cHe\u2019s actually pretty good around here. It took a little trial and error but we make it work. I usually cook and deal with stuff like bills, and he usually makes the place look nice and organised. We take turns with the laundry as we both hate the task equally.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Dan flushed at his mum looked at him impressed. \u201cHmm, I could never make my Daniel do anything, what\u2019s your secret?\u201d Dan blushed scarlet, looking stubbornly at his food.</p><p>Phil kept his cool, smiling at her across the table. \u201cI think we just bounce really well off each other, we both want to live in a nice, clean place so we both pitch in. Keeps everything friendly, no silly fights!\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although Dan\u2019s discomfort made her feel as if that wasn\u2019t the whole truth. Dan looked at Phil sheepishly, apology in his eyes. But Phil simply gave him a reaffirming smile, he knew a parent wiggling for information when he saw one.</p><p>\u201cDan tells me you love dogs, does your contract allow pets? You two would be so good looking after a dog.\u201d She smiled softly. Dan shook his head, \u201cNo pets here sadly.\u201d</p><p>Phil gave a playfully pout, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, I would love a dog.\u201d Dan smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll get one in future, a corgi-shibe cross remember?\u201d \u00a0Phil smiled brightly, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name ready?\u201d Mrs Howell asked with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve went back and forth, Loki is one we likes lot.\u201d Phil smiled as Dan nodded, \u201cWe argued plenty over that one.\u201d He finished off his meal sitting back with a satisfied sigh. \u201cHmm thanks Phil, that was amazing.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, \u201cLoki is a great name for a dog!\u201d He chuckled as he stood, and cleared the three (now completely empty) plates. \u201cThey don\u2019t call me AmazingPhil for nothing.\u201d He quipped.</p><p>Dan snorted and his mum laughed softly, \u201cOne more glass and I should be heading home.\u201d She offered, so Dan poured her one, \u201cYes of course, it was lovely to have you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you boys got planned for tonight then?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled as he put the dishes in the sink, before returning to his seat and taking a sip from his glass. \u201cProbably cleaning up the dishes, then watch a movie or play Mario Kart.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThe usual.\u201d Dan smiled at Phil.</p><p>\u201cVery domestic.\u201d She commented cheekily.</p><p>Phil chuckled softly, but said nothing in protest as it would only confirm her suspicions.</p><hr><p>They finished their drinks and Dan stood to walk his mum to her car, \u201cBe back soon Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It was lovely to see you again Mrs Howell!\u201d Phil waved goodbye.</p><p>The moment they were out of earshot of Phil Mrs Howell struck. \u201cHe\u2019s a very handsome boy.\u201d</p><p>Dan glanced at her suspiciously, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nothing, just wondering you know.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, \u201cMum no, we\u2019re roommates and that\u2019s all.\u201d His Mum watched him for a moment. \u201cI think I left something in the sitting room I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes but let her go. She was smiling when she returned. \u201cAll ready!\u201d He shook his head, \u201cCome on then.\u201d</p><p>They walked out to the car and she pulled him into a tight hug. \u201cHave a good night honey, I\u2019ll see you again soon I\u2019m sure!\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Inside, Phil busied himself cleaning, unaware of Mrs Howell\u2019s questions of her son but inwardly pleased with how smoothly the evening had gone.</p><p>Dan watched her drive away and sighed with relief. He wondered back inside and into the warm kitchen, wrapping his arms around Phil\u2019s waist and dropping his head onto his shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s too damn perceptive sometimes.\u201d He muttered tiredly.</p><p>Phil hummed and leaned his head onto Dan\u2019s, \u201cDid she try and question you again?\u201d Dan nodded, \u201cWanna kiss.\u201d He whined miserably, \u201cHaven\u2019t all day.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled fondly and wrapped his arms around Dan, \u201cC\u2019mere you.\u201d He pulled him in softly and kissed him.</p><p>Dan hummed happily, they kissed lazily for a moment before Dan tucked his head into Phil\u2019s neck. \u201cLove you, thanks for today.\u201d</p><p>Phil rubbed his back softly, \u201cLove you too. Anything for you baby.\u201d</p><p>Dan kissed his neck, \u201cLet me help you finish up the dishes.\u201d Phil hummed, and squeezed his waist. \u201cI\u2019ve got these, you go relax, you look tired.\u201d</p><p>Dan pouted, \u201cBut you did all the cooking!\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled softly and caved, letting Dan help by drying the dishes as he washed them, then together they put everything away.</p><p>Once done Dan immediately snuggled into Phil again, \u201cMovie then bed?\u201d He suggested with a yawn.</p><p>Phil nodded and snuggled him in. \u201cMovie in bed?\u201d He counter offered sweetly.</p><p>Dan smiled, \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><hr><p>It was a week later when Phil spoke up about something he\u2019d notice. He\u2019d searched the kitchen top to bottom, and it was nowhere to be seen. \u201cHey baby? Have you seen our silver serving platter? I haven\u2019t seen it since last week.\u201d He asked, as he looked across at Dan.</p><p>Dan looked up from the book he\u2019d been reading, \u201cHuh? No, have you searched the kitchen? Or it might be in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve searched the kitchen, and in the dining room. Your mum wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 borrowed it, would she?\u201d Phil knew she wouldn\u2019t intentionally take it, maybe Dan had leant it to her and forgot.</p><p>Dan frowned, \u201cWhy would she have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! It\u2019s just weird, I\u2019ll check again,\u201d He pecked Dan\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Dan watched him go, then pulled out his phone and sent a message to him Mum.</p><p>\u2018Hey Mum, you didn\u2019t accidentally take our silver platter did you? We can\u2019t find it.\u2019</p><p>A few moments later, Dan got a response.</p><p>\u2018Hello Daniel. Now I\u2019m not saying that you do sleep with Philip, and I\u2019m not saying that you don\u2019t, but you know I love you and couldn\u2019t care less either way. But nonetheless, if Philip was sleeping in his own bed, he would have found the platter under his pillow. When are the two of you coming for dinner?\u2019</p><p>Dan\u2019s jaw dropped, his expression comical as Phil came back into the room, saying something about it definitely not being there. Phil tilted his head, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d His voice was amused.</p><p>Dan looked up, \u201cShe- oh my god, Phil she hid it under your pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did not! Really?\u201d Phil jogged upstairs and sure enough, he found the platter tucked under one of the pillows of his bed in the filming room. He brought it back downstairs, and shook his head. \u201cWell, at least we know where your quick wit comes from.\u201d</p><p>Dan stared at it, \u201cShe- she wants to know when we\u2019re going around for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? We us, or we Dan and Phil?\u201d He asked curiously, sitting beside him. \u201cWe us.\u201d Dan wasn\u2019t really sure what to think right now.</p><p>Phil smiled softly and pulled Dan carefully into his lap, wrapping his arms affectionately around him. \u201cWe\u2019re free this weekend.\u201d He pecked Dan\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Dan pressed his head into Phil\u2019s neck. \u201cI just came out to my Mum- oh my god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cAnd clearly your mum loves You regardless.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up, he was right. He shuffled a little, \u201cYou said we\u2019re free this weekend?\u201d Phil nodded, \u201cWe could do Saturday?\u201d He offered with a content hum.</p><p>Dan nodded, settling into his lap with a sigh. \u201cYeah, yeah okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed his head, letting him relax and process.</p><p>That had been easier than expected, and it looked like things were going to be just fine.<br></p>",

Phil tilted his head, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you?&rdquo; His voice was amused.</p><p>Dan looked up, &ldquo;She- oh my god, Phil she hid it under your pillow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She did not! Really?&rdquo; Phil jogged upstairs and sure enough, he found the platter tucked under one of the pillows of his bed in the filming room. He brought it back downstairs, and shook his head. &ldquo;Well, at least we know where your quick wit comes from.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stared at it, &ldquo;She- she wants to know when we&rsquo;re going around for dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We? We us, or we Dan and Phil?&rdquo; He asked curiously, sitting beside him. &ldquo;We us.&rdquo; Dan wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to think right now.</p><p>Phil smiled softly and pulled Dan carefully into his lap, wrapping his arms affectionately around him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re free this weekend.&rdquo; He pecked Dan&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p>Dan pressed his head into Phil&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;I just came out to my Mum- oh my god.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you,&rdquo; Phil smiled, &ldquo;And clearly your mum loves You regardless.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looked up, he was right. He shuffled a little, &ldquo;You said we&rsquo;re free this weekend?&rdquo; Phil nodded, &ldquo;We could do Saturday?&rdquo; He offered with a content hum.</p><p>Dan nodded, settling into his lap with a sigh. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil kissed his head, letting him relax and process.</p><p>That had been easier than expected, and it looked like things were going to be just fine.<br /></p>",

Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br/></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 2.6k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and sexual themes </p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/43098152\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://my.w.tt/wRz3waENjV\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><!-- more --><p>\t\u201cI need a week off from work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tLouise looks up from her desk where she is sat in front of Phil, who was currently stood with his hands in his jacket pocket. He didn\u2019t know why he was even doing this. She wasn\u2019t going to give him the time off and this was stupid\u2026he was being stupid.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat for?\u201d She asks, folding her hands on her desk and staring at him with intent.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI would like to take a holiday for myself and I\u2019d like a week to do that.\u201d Phil can feel his voice shaking but he\u2019s trying to remain as calm and confident as he can in hopes of landing this week off.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd where are you going that\u2019s going to require you to take a week off?\u201d Louise presses.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI would like to go to Los Angeles.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ve already looked into tickets and I would like to book them today if possible. This is why I need this week off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd what on Earth are you going to be doing in LA?\u201d Louise asks.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m visiitng Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel Howell?\u201d Louise questions. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his cheeks heat up. \u201cI would like the time off so I can go and visit him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd when are you expecting to have this time off?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt himself tense. He genuinely didn\u2019t know. He hadn\u2019t thought that he\u2019d get this far ahead. When would he do this? Would he even had time to find plane tickets?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, Lester,\u201d Louise says with a smirk. \u201cWe can allow you time off for next week if you really want it. But I have one request.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at her puzzled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBring me back a souvenir from Hollywood, please? My daughters would love something from the United States.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughed and smiled at her, nodding his head because he\u2019ll try and remember to do that. He\u2019s met her daughters Darcy and Pearl before at bring your child to work day and he\u2019s adored them.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quietly left the room after the made sure everything was in fact okay for him to take the time off and he headed back to his desk, eager to message Dan and let him know he was gonna try and find plane tickets even though he\u2015in the back of his head\u2015feared the worst. It was going to be way too sudden to buy them and every thought in his head was telling him that he\u2019s not gonna find anything.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tried not to let that deter him though. He got to his desk and sat down, opening up his laptop and temporarily ignoring the Illustrator file he had started for the new logo he was doing for the BBC Radio 1 advertisements.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opened his messages and quickly typed one out to Dan. He explained how he did get the time off but he hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead about actually finding plane tickets and now he\u2019s feeling a bit lost. He hoped Dan wouldn\u2019t get mad or even think otherwise of him for that one and being a bit of a mess.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he\u2019s done, he closes that window and opens up Illustrator again, ready to dive back into his work when a tap resonates on the wood of his desk. He looks up, following the noise, and sees PJ, having wheeled over to his desk.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat were you talking to Louise about?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI needed to try and get some time off.\u201d Phil says, sitting back in his desk chair and crossing his left leg over the other.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh? Where are you heading?\u201d PJ asks, his glasses falling slightly to the bridge of his nose.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m hoping to go to Los Angeles.\u201d Phil says, his voice wavering. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I can even find tickets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you going to be doing in LA?\u201d PJ questioned. \u201cIs it one of those YouTuber conventions? I heard that was happening but I don\u2019t know the dates.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m actually visiting Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy are you going to LA to visit Dan?\u201d PJ pressed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe wants me to go to LA.\u201d Phil says. \u201cHe wants to show me around and he wants to just spend time with him. But he has filming around LA still for the next two weeks and so he can\u2019t leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit\u2026daft to go all the way to LA just to meet up with Dan?\u201d PJ asks. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not judging by any means but this is a big step and a lot of money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t care about the money.\u201d Phil finds himself saying, which isn\u2019t entirely true. He didn\u2019t really have a lot of extra money to spare between paying bills, paying his rent, and buying his and Spike\u2019s food and other necessities. But he\u2019d take a trip to LA to see Dan no matter the cost.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bites his lip. \u201cI kind of don\u2019t have plane tickets yet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ\u2019s eyes widened and his mouth opened slightly. \u201cYou\u2026Phil, what do you mean you don\u2019t have tickets yet? They\u2019re plane tickets. You can\u2019t just get them whenever you want, they do become sold out.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, PJ!\u201d Phil countered. \u201cDan and I just were talking the other night and he sounded like he really wanted me to come and see him and I really want to see him too. We never really thought of the logistics of it but..\u201d Phil paused. \u201cI really miss him, PJ.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know,\u201d PJ says, his lips curling up in a smile. \u201cI only hear you talk about him every day that you\u2019re here. You have a fondness for him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his cheeks heat up as he gets ready to retort against what PJ said. He opens his mouth, about to say something when his computer lets out a beep and he turns and sees the bubble for one new message.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens it and reads it.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Oh thats not a problem ill just send my jet to pick you up</p><p>\t\u201cDan has a private jet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not all that shocking.\u201d PJ says with a light chuckle. \u201cI imagine with the money he\u2019s taking in that he probably can afford a fleet of them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut he\u2019s sending his private jet for me to come to LA on.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTrue love.\u201d PJ says with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not love, PJ.\u201d Phil says. \u201cWe\u2019re not dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot for long, you\u2019re not. Maybe he\u2019s flying you to LA to plan some big extravagant way to ask you to get into bed with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have to try too hard for that one, mate. Kind of already breached that line.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ looked at Phil, his green eyes going a bit bigger again in surprise. \u201cDo spill!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like we slept together.\u201d Phil begins, not being able to have a filter now that he\u2019s speaking directly with PJ, someone who he considers to be his best friend. \u201cBut we did kind of get each other off? But it was over Skype. Not like directly us with each other.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd how did it feel?\u201d PJ asked.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his brows furrow. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018how did it feel?\u2019. It felt bloody incredible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d PJ began to clarify. \u201cBut being with Dan intimately, even if it was over a screen, how did that make you feel?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sat back in his chair again and thought to the way Dan looked over Skype.

And maybe Phil is overthinking it just a tad, because he does tend to do that, but it is bothering him that he doesn\u2019t really know if Dan was having second thoughts or not. Sure, he could say something to Dan. But wouldn\u2019t it be awkward to open up a conversation by saying \u201chey, are you okay with the way we got off while on Skype?\u201d</p><p>\tHe should talk to Dan. He knows that he should but he can\u2019t seem to bridge that awkwardness to do so. What if he had been reading these signs all wrong? What if Dan really was looking for just someone to quickly sleep with to get his mind off from everything else? But Dan wouldn\u2019t do that? Phil wouldn\u2019t let his mind believe that.\u00a0</p><p>\tFuck.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know what to think. He doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis phone suddenly goes off and the loud sound of the vibrations against the counter throw him off his balance and he jumps into the air with a gasp.

If Dan replies back with a flirty text, clearly what happened over Skype will be fine and all will move on. If he doesn\u2019t\u2026Phil bites his lip. He really doesn\u2019t want to think of that outcome if he\u2019s being honest.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>im not pretty your prettier\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil can forgive all of the grammar and spelling mistake in Dan\u2019s text through the feeling of the flutters in his heart. Okay, Phil feels a bit better about this now.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil</b>: I can\u2019t wait to see you on Sunday. I really miss you.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>i miss you too\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>why aren\u2019t you in bed with me\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>im sleepy and i wanna cuddle\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his heart melt out of his chest. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t be feeling this lovestruck over something that he\u2019s not even sure of yet, but he can\u2019t help it. He can\u2019t help it when he\u2019s texting someone as beautiful and stunning as Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s never wanted someone as beautiful and stunning as Dan. In just a few short weeks\u2026barely two months\u2026Phil has done something that he hasn\u2019t been able to do in a very long time.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s fallen in love.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s fallen in love with the Skype calls. The pictures. The texts. The calls. Dan\u2019s voice, his eyes, and his smile.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s fallen hard for Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd all he can do is pray to whatever God is up there that Dan feels the same way.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil continues to text Dan for a while until his eyes get tired and he has to force himself to end the conversation. But before he goes, he sends Dan a voice message saying goodnight and then he gets out his suitcase.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe may still have a week before he leaves, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t pack for what is about to be the most amazing time of his life.\u00a0</p>",

He didn\u2019t know why he was even doing this. She wasn\u2019t going to give him the time off and this was stupid\u2026he was being stupid.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat for?\u201d She asks, folding her hands on her desk and staring at him with intent.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI would like to take a holiday for myself and I\u2019d like a week to do that.\u201d Phil can feel his voice shaking but he\u2019s trying to remain as calm and confident as he can in hopes of landing this week off.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd where are you going that\u2019s going to require you to take a week off?\u201d Louise presses.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI would like to go to Los Angeles.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ve already looked into tickets and I would like to book them today if possible. This is why I need this week off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd what on Earth are you going to be doing in LA?\u201d Louise asks.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m visiitng Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel Howell?\u201d Louise questions. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his cheeks heat up. \u201cI would like the time off so I can go and visit him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd when are you expecting to have this time off?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt himself tense. He genuinely didn\u2019t know. He hadn\u2019t thought that he\u2019d get this far ahead. When would he do this? Would he even had time to find plane tickets?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, Lester,\u201d Louise says with a smirk. \u201cWe can allow you time off for next week if you really want it. But I have one request.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at her puzzled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBring me back a souvenir from Hollywood, please? My daughters would love something from the United States.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughed and smiled at her, nodding his head because he\u2019ll try and remember to do that. He\u2019s met her daughters Darcy and Pearl before at bring your child to work day and he\u2019s adored them.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quietly left the room after the made sure everything was in fact okay for him to take the time off and he headed back to his desk, eager to message Dan and let him know he was gonna try and find plane tickets even though he\u2015in the back of his head\u2015feared the worst. It was going to be way too sudden to buy them and every thought in his head was telling him that he\u2019s not gonna find anything.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tried not to let that deter him though. He got to his desk and sat down, opening up his laptop and temporarily ignoring the Illustrator file he had started for the new logo he was doing for the BBC Radio 1 advertisements.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opened his messages and quickly typed one out to Dan. He explained how he did get the time off but he hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead about actually finding plane tickets and now he\u2019s feeling a bit lost. He hoped Dan wouldn\u2019t get mad or even think otherwise of him for that one and being a bit of a mess.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he\u2019s done, he closes that window and opens up Illustrator again, ready to dive back into his work when a tap resonates on the wood of his desk. He looks up, following the noise, and sees PJ, having wheeled over to his desk.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat were you talking to Louise about?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI needed to try and get some time off.\u201d Phil says, sitting back in his desk chair and crossing his left leg over the other.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh? Where are you heading?\u201d PJ asks, his glasses falling slightly to the bridge of his nose.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m hoping to go to Los Angeles.\u201d Phil says, his voice wavering. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I can even find tickets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you going to be doing in LA?\u201d PJ questioned. \u201cIs it one of those YouTuber conventions? I heard that was happening but I don\u2019t know the dates.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m actually visiting Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy are you going to LA to visit Dan?\u201d PJ pressed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe wants me to go to LA.\u201d Phil says. \u201cHe wants to show me around and he wants to just spend time with him. But he has filming around LA still for the next two weeks and so he can\u2019t leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit\u2026daft to go all the way to LA just to meet up with Dan?\u201d PJ asks. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not judging by any means but this is a big step and a lot of money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t care about the money.\u201d Phil finds himself saying, which isn\u2019t entirely true. He didn\u2019t really have a lot of extra money to spare between paying bills, paying his rent, and buying his and Spike\u2019s food and other necessities. But he\u2019d take a trip to LA to see Dan no matter the cost.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bites his lip. \u201cI kind of don\u2019t have plane tickets yet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ\u2019s eyes widened and his mouth opened slightly. \u201cYou\u2026Phil, what do you mean you don\u2019t have tickets yet? They\u2019re plane tickets. You can\u2019t just get them whenever you want, they do become sold out.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, PJ!\u201d Phil countered. \u201cDan and I just were talking the other night and he sounded like he really wanted me to come and see him and I really want to see him too. We never really thought of the logistics of it but..\u201d Phil paused. \u201cI really miss him, PJ.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know,\u201d PJ says, his lips curling up in a smile. \u201cI only hear you talk about him every day that you\u2019re here. You have a fondness for him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his cheeks heat up as he gets ready to retort against what PJ said. He opens his mouth, about to say something when his computer lets out a beep and he turns and sees the bubble for one new message.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens it and reads it.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Oh thats not a problem ill just send my jet to pick you up</p><p>\t\u201cDan has a private jet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not all that shocking.\u201d PJ says with a light chuckle. \u201cI imagine with the money he\u2019s taking in that he probably can afford a fleet of them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut he\u2019s sending his private jet for me to come to LA on.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTrue love.\u201d PJ says with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not love, PJ.\u201d Phil says. \u201cWe\u2019re not dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot for long, you\u2019re not. Maybe he\u2019s flying you to LA to plan some big extravagant way to ask you to get into bed with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have to try too hard for that one, mate. Kind of already breached that line.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ looked at Phil, his green eyes going a bit bigger again in surprise. \u201cDo spill!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like we slept together.\u201d Phil begins, not being able to have a filter now that he\u2019s speaking directly with PJ, someone who he considers to be his best friend. \u201cBut we did kind of get each other off? But it was over Skype. Not like directly us with each other.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd how did it feel?\u201d PJ asked.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his brows furrow. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018how did it feel?\u2019. It felt bloody incredible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d PJ began to clarify. \u201cBut being with Dan intimately, even if it was over a screen, how did that make you feel?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sat back in his chair again and thought to the way Dan looked over Skype. Dan was gorgeous anyway. He didn\u2019t need any help to showcase his natural beauty. From his hair to his eyes to his skin to his smile, he was stunning. And Phil very much was in awe every time he thought of how he\u2019d managed to snag the attention of such a well know heartthrob.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really like him.\u201d Phil says, not answering the question directly. \u201cYou know, maybe I\u2019ll ask him out when I\u2019m in LA.\u201d Phil continues, biting his lip. \u201cI think I\u2019m ready now to move past this line and see where it gets us.\u201d</p><p>\tPJ flashed him a smile. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you. And I can\u2019t wait to hear of the new \u2018IT\u2019 couple that comes out of Hollywood when it gets out that you guys are dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really don\u2019t want to think about that.\u201d Phil said with a nervous chuckle. \u201cBut right now, I kind of just want to focus on finally admitting my feelings regarding Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ leaned over the desk and pat his arm affectionately. Phil flashed him a smile back and then they went back to work. Phil sent Dan back a message and a then he went back to finishing his logo. When it was time for them to both leave, they hopped on the same Tube train and went to a pub that they both liked for dinner and a few drinks.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cHey guys! Phil here\u2026no, that\u2019s rubbish isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaned back on his couch and rubbed his hands stubbornly over his face. He was never going to the introduction right for his video. They all sounded so forced and rubbish and he was beginning to seriously doubt that he\u2019d be able to do this.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sat back up and looked at the camera on the tripod again and took a deep breath. He let it back out, forced a smile, and tried again. \u201cHey guys! It\u2019s Phil here! And today, I\u2019m going to be answering your questions. I received a lot of them from everyone and I\u2019m really eager to answer them so let\u2019s jump right in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe smiled at himself. That would work! He reckoned he sounded pretty good right then and there. He got out his laptop and pulled up the list of questions he had chosen and sceenshotted and began again.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFirst question is from Nicki underscore Rivera nineteen who asks \u2018didn\u2019t you used to make YouTube videos a while ago?

He just had ten more to get through but he could do it!\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil went through each question one by one and answered each one as honestly as he could without leaking too much of his private information. He saw so many of the questions asking for him to clarify his relationship with Dan or other prying for pictures of him and Dan. Frankly, Phil didn\u2019t ever want to just speak so openly at him and Dan to people he knew as strangers.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe finished up the last question and then said his goodbyes to the camera and reached over, hitting the record button again to shut it off. He slowly took off the camera from the tripod and put it into his lap as he looked at the footage the best he could on the small view finder.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil turned off the camera and pulled out the SD card before taking his laptop with him to the breakfast bar and setting up a mini office there so he could begin to edit the video.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike had been sleeping the entire time in his bed in the corner which Phil was grateful for.

He genuinely didn\u2019t know. He hadn\u2019t thought that he\u2019d get this far ahead. When would he do this? Would he even had time to find plane tickets?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, Lester,\u201d Louise says with a smirk. \u201cWe can allow you time off for next week if you really want it. But I have one request.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at her puzzled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBring me back a souvenir from Hollywood, please? My daughters would love something from the United States.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughed and smiled at her, nodding his head because he\u2019ll try and remember to do that. He\u2019s met her daughters Darcy and Pearl before at bring your child to work day and he\u2019s adored them.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quietly left the room after the made sure everything was in fact okay for him to take the time off and he headed back to his desk, eager to message Dan and let him know he was gonna try and find plane tickets even though he\u2015in the back of his head\u2015feared the worst. It was going to be way too sudden to buy them and every thought in his head was telling him that he\u2019s not gonna find anything.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tried not to let that deter him though. He got to his desk and sat down, opening up his laptop and temporarily ignoring the Illustrator file he had started for the new logo he was doing for the BBC Radio 1 advertisements.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opened his messages and quickly typed one out to Dan. He explained how he did get the time off but he hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead about actually finding plane tickets and now he\u2019s feeling a bit lost. He hoped Dan wouldn\u2019t get mad or even think otherwise of him for that one and being a bit of a mess.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he\u2019s done, he closes that window and opens up Illustrator again, ready to dive back into his work when a tap resonates on the wood of his desk. He looks up, following the noise, and sees PJ, having wheeled over to his desk.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat were you talking to Louise about?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI needed to try and get some time off.\u201d Phil says, sitting back in his desk chair and crossing his left leg over the other.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh? Where are you heading?\u201d PJ asks, his glasses falling slightly to the bridge of his nose.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m hoping to go to Los Angeles.\u201d Phil says, his voice wavering. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I can even find tickets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you going to be doing in LA?\u201d PJ questioned. \u201cIs it one of those YouTuber conventions? I heard that was happening but I don\u2019t know the dates.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m actually visiting Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy are you going to LA to visit Dan?\u201d PJ pressed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe wants me to go to LA.\u201d Phil says. \u201cHe wants to show me around and he wants to just spend time with him. But he has filming around LA still for the next two weeks and so he can\u2019t leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit\u2026daft to go all the way to LA just to meet up with Dan?\u201d PJ asks. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not judging by any means but this is a big step and a lot of money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t care about the money.\u201d Phil finds himself saying, which isn\u2019t entirely true. He didn\u2019t really have a lot of extra money to spare between paying bills, paying his rent, and buying his and Spike\u2019s food and other necessities. But he\u2019d take a trip to LA to see Dan no matter the cost.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bites his lip. \u201cI kind of don\u2019t have plane tickets yet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ\u2019s eyes widened and his mouth opened slightly. \u201cYou\u2026Phil, what do you mean you don\u2019t have tickets yet? They\u2019re plane tickets. You can\u2019t just get them whenever you want, they do become sold out.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, PJ!\u201d Phil countered. \u201cDan and I just were talking the other night and he sounded like he really wanted me to come and see him and I really want to see him too. We never really thought of the logistics of it but..\u201d Phil paused. \u201cI really miss him, PJ.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know,\u201d PJ says, his lips curling up in a smile. \u201cI only hear you talk about him every day that you\u2019re here. You have a fondness for him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his cheeks heat up as he gets ready to retort against what PJ said. He opens his mouth, about to say something when his computer lets out a beep and he turns and sees the bubble for one new message.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens it and reads it.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Oh thats not a problem ill just send my jet to pick you up</p><p>\t\u201cDan has a private jet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not all that shocking.\u201d PJ says with a light chuckle. \u201cI imagine with the money he\u2019s taking in that he probably can afford a fleet of them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut he\u2019s sending his private jet for me to come to LA on.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTrue love.\u201d PJ says with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not love, PJ.\u201d Phil says. \u201cWe\u2019re not dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot for long, you\u2019re not. Maybe he\u2019s flying you to LA to plan some big extravagant way to ask you to get into bed with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have to try too hard for that one, mate. Kind of already breached that line.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ looked at Phil, his green eyes going a bit bigger again in surprise. \u201cDo spill!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like we slept together.\u201d Phil begins, not being able to have a filter now that he\u2019s speaking directly with PJ, someone who he considers to be his best friend. \u201cBut we did kind of get each other off? But it was over Skype. Not like directly us with each other.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd how did it feel?\u201d PJ asked.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his brows furrow. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018how did it feel?\u2019. It felt bloody incredible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d PJ began to clarify. \u201cBut being with Dan intimately, even if it was over a screen, how did that make you feel?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sat back in his chair again and thought to the way Dan looked over Skype. Dan was gorgeous anyway. He didn\u2019t need any help to showcase his natural beauty. From his hair to his eyes to his skin to his smile, he was stunning. And Phil very much was in awe every time he thought of how he\u2019d managed to snag the attention of such a well know heartthrob.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really like him.\u201d Phil says, not answering the question directly. \u201cYou know, maybe I\u2019ll ask him out when I\u2019m in LA.\u201d Phil continues, biting his lip. \u201cI think I\u2019m ready now to move past this line and see where it gets us.\u201d</p><p>\tPJ flashed him a smile. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you. And I can\u2019t wait to hear of the new \u2018IT\u2019 couple that comes out of Hollywood when it gets out that you guys are dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really don\u2019t want to think about that.\u201d Phil said with a nervous chuckle. \u201cBut right now, I kind of just want to focus on finally admitting my feelings regarding Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ leaned over the desk and pat his arm affectionately. Phil flashed him a smile back and then they went back to work. Phil sent Dan back a message and a then he went back to finishing his logo. When it was time for them to both leave, they hopped on the same Tube train and went to a pub that they both liked for dinner and a few drinks.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cHey guys! Phil here\u2026no, that\u2019s rubbish isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaned back on his couch and rubbed his hands stubbornly over his face. He was never going to the introduction right for his video. They all sounded so forced and rubbish and he was beginning to seriously doubt that he\u2019d be able to do this.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sat back up and looked at the camera on the tripod again and took a deep breath. He let it back out, forced a smile, and tried again. \u201cHey guys! It\u2019s Phil here! And today, I\u2019m going to be answering your questions. I received a lot of them from everyone and I\u2019m really eager to answer them so let\u2019s jump right in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe smiled at himself. That would work! He reckoned he sounded pretty good right then and there. He got out his laptop and pulled up the list of questions he had chosen and sceenshotted and began again.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFirst question is from Nicki underscore Rivera nineteen who asks \u2018didn\u2019t you used to make YouTube videos a while ago? What happened?\u2019 Well Nicki, I did used to make videos back in\u20262009? Yeah, I think that\u2019s correct. But then I got busy with life and being an adult and I kind of lost touch in something I enjoyed so much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he was done, he mentally applauded himself for getting through the first question. He just had ten more to get through but he could do it!\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil went through each question one by one and answered each one as honestly as he could without leaking too much of his private information. He saw so many of the questions asking for him to clarify his relationship with Dan or other prying for pictures of him and Dan. Frankly, Phil didn\u2019t ever want to just speak so openly at him and Dan to people he knew as strangers.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe finished up the last question and then said his goodbyes to the camera and reached over, hitting the record button again to shut it off. He slowly took off the camera from the tripod and put it into his lap as he looked at the footage the best he could on the small view finder.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil turned off the camera and pulled out the SD card before taking his laptop with him to the breakfast bar and setting up a mini office there so he could begin to edit the video.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike had been sleeping the entire time in his bed in the corner which Phil was grateful for. He didn\u2019t need his little fur baby jumping into the shot every few seconds because he wanted a treat or a belly rub. Although, Phil will probably give him a treat later for being such a good boy while he filmed.\u00a0</p><p>\tBefore Phil had sat down and begun to film, he\u2019d briefly talked to Dan over the phone. It was surreal, really, to talk to Dan as he was waking up and Phil was just getting home from being with PJ. The time differences were still something he wasn\u2019t quite able to get used to but pretty soon, he\u2019d be with Dan for a short while in the same timezone.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe thing though was that they haven\u2019t discussed what happened over Skype that one night. And maybe Phil is overthinking it just a tad, because he does tend to do that, but it is bothering him that he doesn\u2019t really know if Dan was having second thoughts or not. Sure, he could say something to Dan. But wouldn\u2019t it be awkward to open up a conversation by saying \u201chey, are you okay with the way we got off while on Skype?\u201d</p><p>\tHe should talk to Dan. He knows that he should but he can\u2019t seem to bridge that awkwardness to do so. What if he had been reading these signs all wrong? What if Dan really was looking for just someone to quickly sleep with to get his mind off from everything else? But Dan wouldn\u2019t do that? Phil wouldn\u2019t let his mind believe that.\u00a0</p><p>\tFuck.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know what to think. He doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis phone suddenly goes off and the loud sound of the vibrations against the counter throw him off his balance and he jumps into the air with a gasp. He quickly picks up his phone and looks at it.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>have to attend a party tonight with the cast but id rather be on Skype with you :(\u00a0</p><p>\tAttached with the text is a picture of Dan half awake in his bed, his eyes hardly open and his curly hair falling over his face. Phil feels himself coo a little bit. Dan looks adorable. He looks so peaceful and dreamy and Phil can\u2019t wait to experience what it\u2019s like to wake up and see Dan like that, just looking at him.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>stop being so pretty :(\u00a0</p><p>\tThis was testing the waters. If Dan replies back with a flirty text, clearly what happened over Skype will be fine and all will move on. If he doesn\u2019t\u2026Phil bites his lip. He really doesn\u2019t want to think of that outcome if he\u2019s being honest.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>im not pretty your prettier\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil can forgive all of the grammar and spelling mistake in Dan\u2019s text through the feeling of the flutters in his heart. Okay, Phil feels a bit better about this now.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil</b>: I can\u2019t wait to see you on Sunday. I really miss you.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>i miss you too\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>why aren\u2019t you in bed with me\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>im sleepy and i wanna cuddle\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his heart melt out of his chest. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t be feeling this lovestruck over something that he\u2019s not even sure of yet, but he can\u2019t help it. He can\u2019t help it when he\u2019s texting someone as beautiful and stunning as Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s never wanted someone as beautiful and stunning as Dan. In just a few short weeks\u2026barely two months\u2026Phil has done something that he hasn\u2019t been able to do in a very long time.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s fallen in love.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s fallen in love with the Skype calls. The pictures. The texts. The calls. Dan\u2019s voice, his eyes, and his smile.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s fallen hard for Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd all he can do is pray to whatever God is up there that Dan feels the same way.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil continues to text Dan for a while until his eyes get tired and he has to force himself to end the conversation. But before he goes, he sends Dan a voice message saying goodnight and then he gets out his suitcase.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe may still have a week before he leaves, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t pack for what is about to be the most amazing time of his life.\u00a0</p>",

However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br /></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 2.6k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and sexual themes </p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/43098152\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://my.w.tt/wRz3waENjV\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><p>\t&ldquo;I need a week off from work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tLouise looks up from her desk where she is sat in front of Phil, who was currently stood with his hands in his jacket pocket. He didn&rsquo;t know why he was even doing this. She wasn&rsquo;t going to give him the time off and this was stupid&hellip;he was being stupid.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; She asks, folding her hands on her desk and staring at him with intent.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I would like to take a holiday for myself and I&rsquo;d like a week to do that.&rdquo; Phil can feel his voice shaking but he&rsquo;s trying to remain as calm and confident as he can in hopes of landing this week off.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And where are you going that&rsquo;s going to require you to take a week off?&rdquo; Louise presses.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I would like to go to Los Angeles.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already looked into tickets and I would like to book them today if possible. This is why I need this week off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And what on Earth are you going to be doing in LA?&rdquo; Louise asks.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m visiitng Dan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Daniel Howell?&rdquo; Louise questions. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels his cheeks heat up. &ldquo;I would like the time off so I can go and visit him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And when are you expecting to have this time off?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt himself tense. He genuinely didn&rsquo;t know. He hadn&rsquo;t thought that he&rsquo;d get this far ahead. When would he do this? Would he even had time to find plane tickets?&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, Lester,&rdquo; Louise says with a smirk. &ldquo;We can allow you time off for next week if you really want it. But I have one request.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looked at her puzzled. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Bring me back a souvenir from Hollywood, please? My daughters would love something from the United States.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil laughed and smiled at her, nodding his head because he&rsquo;ll try and remember to do that. He&rsquo;s met her daughters Darcy and Pearl before at bring your child to work day and he&rsquo;s adored them.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe quietly left the room after the made sure everything was in fact okay for him to take the time off and he headed back to his desk, eager to message Dan and let him know he was gonna try and find plane tickets even though he&#8213;in the back of his head&#8213;feared the worst. It was going to be way too sudden to buy them and every thought in his head was telling him that he&rsquo;s not gonna find anything.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe tried not to let that deter him though. He got to his desk and sat down, opening up his laptop and temporarily ignoring the Illustrator file he had started for the new logo he was doing for the BBC Radio 1 advertisements.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil opened his messages and quickly typed one out to Dan. He explained how he did get the time off but he hadn&rsquo;t thought that far ahead about actually finding plane tickets and now he&rsquo;s feeling a bit lost. He hoped Dan wouldn&rsquo;t get mad or even think otherwise of him for that one and being a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen he&rsquo;s done, he closes that window and opens up Illustrator again, ready to dive back into his work when a tap resonates on the wood of his desk. He looks up, following the noise, and sees PJ, having wheeled over to his desk.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What were you talking to Louise about?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I needed to try and get some time off.&rdquo; Phil says, sitting back in his desk chair and crossing his left leg over the other.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh? Where are you heading?&rdquo; PJ asks, his glasses falling slightly to the bridge of his nose.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping to go to Los Angeles.&rdquo; Phil says, his voice wavering. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sure I can even find tickets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What are you going to be doing in LA?&rdquo; PJ questioned. &ldquo;Is it one of those YouTuber conventions? I heard that was happening but I don&rsquo;t know the dates.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m actually visiting Dan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nodded.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why are you going to LA to visit Dan?&rdquo; PJ pressed.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He wants me to go to LA.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;He wants to show me around and he wants to just spend time with him. But he has filming around LA still for the next two weeks and so he can&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a bit&hellip;daft to go all the way to LA just to meet up with Dan?&rdquo; PJ asks. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m not judging by any means but this is a big step and a lot of money.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about the money.&rdquo; Phil finds himself saying, which isn&rsquo;t entirely true. He didn&rsquo;t really have a lot of extra money to spare between paying bills, paying his rent, and buying his and Spike&rsquo;s food and other necessities. But he&rsquo;d take a trip to LA to see Dan no matter the cost.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;When do you leave?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil bites his lip. &ldquo;I kind of don&rsquo;t have plane tickets yet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ&rsquo;s eyes widened and his mouth opened slightly. &ldquo;You&hellip;Phil, what do you mean you don&rsquo;t have tickets yet? They&rsquo;re plane tickets. You can&rsquo;t just get them whenever you want, they do become sold out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know, PJ!&rdquo; Phil countered. &ldquo;Dan and I just were talking the other night and he sounded like he really wanted me to come and see him and I really want to see him too. We never really thought of the logistics of it but..&rdquo; Phil paused. &ldquo;I really miss him, PJ.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; PJ says, his lips curling up in a smile. &ldquo;I only hear you talk about him every day that you&rsquo;re here. You have a fondness for him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels his cheeks heat up as he gets ready to retort against what PJ said. He opens his mouth, about to say something when his computer lets out a beep and he turns and sees the bubble for one new message.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe opens it and reads it.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Oh thats not a problem ill just send my jet to pick you up</p><p>\t&ldquo;Dan has a private jet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all that shocking.&rdquo; PJ says with a light chuckle. &ldquo;I imagine with the money he&rsquo;s taking in that he probably can afford a fleet of them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s sending his private jet for me to come to LA on.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;True love.&rdquo; PJ says with a smile.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not love, PJ.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not dating.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not for long, you&rsquo;re not. Maybe he&rsquo;s flying you to LA to plan some big extravagant way to ask you to get into bed with him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil blushed. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have to try too hard for that one, mate. Kind of already breached that line.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ looked at Phil, his green eyes going a bit bigger again in surprise. &ldquo;Do spill!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we slept together.&rdquo; Phil begins, not being able to have a filter now that he&rsquo;s speaking directly with PJ, someone who he considers to be his best friend. &ldquo;But we did kind of get each other off? But it was over Skype. Not like directly us with each other.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And how did it feel?&rdquo; PJ asked.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his brows furrow. &ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;how did it feel?&rsquo;. It felt bloody incredible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant.&rdquo; PJ began to clarify. &ldquo;But being with Dan intimately, even if it was over a screen, how did that make you feel?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil sat back in his chair again and thought to the way Dan looked over Skype. Dan was gorgeous anyway. He didn&rsquo;t need any help to showcase his natural beauty. From his hair to his eyes to his skin to his smile, he was stunning. And Phil very much was in awe every time he thought of how he&rsquo;d managed to snag the attention of such a well know heartthrob.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I really like him.&rdquo; Phil says, not answering the question directly. &ldquo;You know, maybe I&rsquo;ll ask him out when I&rsquo;m in LA.&rdquo; Phil continues, biting his lip. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m ready now to move past this line and see where it gets us.&rdquo;</p><p>\tPJ flashed him a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really proud of you. And I can&rsquo;t wait to hear of the new &lsquo;IT&rsquo; couple that comes out of Hollywood when it gets out that you guys are dating.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to think about that.&rdquo; Phil said with a nervous chuckle. &ldquo;But right now, I kind of just want to focus on finally admitting my feelings regarding Dan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ leaned over the desk and pat his arm affectionately. Phil flashed him a smile back and then they went back to work. Phil sent Dan back a message and a then he went back to finishing his logo. When it was time for them to both leave, they hopped on the same Tube train and went to a pub that they both liked for dinner and a few drinks.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey guys! Phil here&hellip;no, that&rsquo;s rubbish isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil leaned back on his couch and rubbed his hands stubbornly over his face. He was never going to the introduction right for his video. They all sounded so forced and rubbish and he was beginning to seriously doubt that he&rsquo;d be able to do this.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe sat back up and looked at the camera on the tripod again and took a deep breath. He let it back out, forced a smile, and tried again. &ldquo;Hey guys! It&rsquo;s Phil here! And today, I&rsquo;m going to be answering your questions. I received a lot of them from everyone and I&rsquo;m really eager to answer them so let&rsquo;s jump right in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe smiled at himself. That would work! He reckoned he sounded pretty good right then and there. He got out his laptop and pulled up the list of questions he had chosen and sceenshotted and began again.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;First question is from Nicki underscore Rivera nineteen who asks &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t you used to make YouTube videos a while ago? What happened?&rsquo; Well Nicki, I did used to make videos back in&hellip;2009? Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s correct. But then I got busy with life and being an adult and I kind of lost touch in something I enjoyed so much.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen he was done, he mentally applauded himself for getting through the first question. He just had ten more to get through but he could do it!&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil went through each question one by one and answered each one as honestly as he could without leaking too much of his private information. He saw so many of the questions asking for him to clarify his relationship with Dan or other prying for pictures of him and Dan. Frankly, Phil didn&rsquo;t ever want to just speak so openly at him and Dan to people he knew as strangers.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe finished up the last question and then said his goodbyes to the camera and reached over, hitting the record button again to shut it off. He slowly took off the camera from the tripod and put it into his lap as he looked at the footage the best he could on the small view finder.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil turned off the camera and pulled out the SD card before taking his laptop with him to the breakfast bar and setting up a mini office there so he could begin to edit the video.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSpike had been sleeping the entire time in his bed in the corner which Phil was grateful for. He didn&rsquo;t need his little fur baby jumping into the shot every few seconds because he wanted a treat or a belly rub. Although, Phil will probably give him a treat later for being such a good boy while he filmed.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBefore Phil had sat down and begun to film, he&rsquo;d briefly talked to Dan over the phone. It was surreal, really, to talk to Dan as he was waking up and Phil was just getting home from being with PJ. The time differences were still something he wasn&rsquo;t quite able to get used to but pretty soon, he&rsquo;d be with Dan for a short while in the same timezone.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe thing though was that they haven&rsquo;t discussed what happened over Skype that one night. And maybe Phil is overthinking it just a tad, because he does tend to do that, but it is bothering him that he doesn&rsquo;t really know if Dan was having second thoughts or not. Sure, he could say something to Dan. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be awkward to open up a conversation by saying &ldquo;hey, are you okay with the way we got off while on Skype?&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe should talk to Dan. He knows that he should but he can&rsquo;t seem to bridge that awkwardness to do so. What if he had been reading these signs all wrong? What if Dan really was looking for just someone to quickly sleep with to get his mind off from everything else? But Dan wouldn&rsquo;t do that? Phil wouldn&rsquo;t let his mind believe that.&nbsp;</p><p>\tFuck.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil doesn&rsquo;t know what to think. He doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis phone suddenly goes off and the loud sound of the vibrations against the counter throw him off his balance and he jumps into the air with a gasp. He quickly picks up his phone and looks at it.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>have to attend a party tonight with the cast but id rather be on Skype with you :(&nbsp;</p><p>\tAttached with the text is a picture of Dan half awake in his bed, his eyes hardly open and his curly hair falling over his face. Phil feels himself coo a little bit. Dan looks adorable. He looks so peaceful and dreamy and Phil can&rsquo;t wait to experience what it&rsquo;s like to wake up and see Dan like that, just looking at him.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>stop being so pretty :(&nbsp;</p><p>\tThis was testing the waters. If Dan replies back with a flirty text, clearly what happened over Skype will be fine and all will move on. If he doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;Phil bites his lip. He really doesn&rsquo;t want to think of that outcome if he&rsquo;s being honest.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>im not pretty your prettier&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil can forgive all of the grammar and spelling mistake in Dan&rsquo;s text through the feeling of the flutters in his heart. Okay, Phil feels a bit better about this now.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Phil</b>: I can&rsquo;t wait to see you on Sunday. I really miss you.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>i miss you too&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>why aren&rsquo;t you in bed with me&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>im sleepy and i wanna cuddle&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels his heart melt out of his chest. Maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling this lovestruck over something that he&rsquo;s not even sure of yet, but he can&rsquo;t help it. He can&rsquo;t help it when he&rsquo;s texting someone as beautiful and stunning as Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s never wanted someone as beautiful and stunning as Dan. In just a few short weeks&hellip;barely two months&hellip;Phil has done something that he hasn&rsquo;t been able to do in a very long time.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s fallen in love.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s fallen in love with the Skype calls. The pictures. The texts. The calls. Dan&rsquo;s voice, his eyes, and his smile.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil&rsquo;s fallen hard for Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnd all he can do is pray to whatever God is up there that Dan feels the same way.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil continues to text Dan for a while until his eyes get tired and he has to force himself to end the conversation. But before he goes, he sends Dan a voice message saying goodnight and then he gets out his suitcase.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe may still have a week before he leaves, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he can&rsquo;t pack for what is about to be the most amazing time of his life.&nbsp;</p>",
