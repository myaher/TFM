Ready to talk to Karen for hours as he pushed himself to the limit.\nHe should\u2019ve done more. He should\u2019ve helped you. Every single time he tried to\nsleep he couldn\u2019t help but see your lifeless body as he tried his best to keep\nyou here.</p><p>So as Peter was ready for the automatic doors to open to the\ntraining room, he was surprised to\nfind it shut.

Anyone?\u201d Peter shouted out into the building,\nbut nothing came of it. As he headed up to the main quarters, he saw a little\nnote left upon the table. As Peter approached the table, a pang in his heart\nwas forever present as he picked up the note. It had your address on it.</p><p><i>\u2018Y/N wouldn\u2019t want you\nto cry over her kid. We all love you. Take a visit. \u2013 The Avengers\u2019</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes began to sting with tears as he looked at the table\nagain. There were your keys; familiar keychains strung upon it, including a\nSpider-man one and another with your superhero trademark upon it also. This was\nit, Peter stared at those keys for what felt like hours but was most likely\nabout 10 minutes. Until he finally decided to bite the bullet. He grabbed them and\npulled his mask over his face.</p><p>Peter swung through the streets, having KAREN help him with\nthe navigation. When he arrived at your apartment door, Peter couldn\u2019t help but\njust stare again.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Why aren\u2019t you heading in?\u201d KAREN asked him as she\ntoo could only stare at your door. Your last name in metallic letters beneath\nthe door number.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know Karen. It-It\u2019s like I can\u2019t move.\u201d Peter\nclenched his jaw as he tried to not cry with his mask on, but it was true. He felt\nlike his entire body was frozen in this one spot and would be forever.</p><p>\u201cI can help you with that Peter if you-\u201c KAREN starts to use\nher technology to move Peter\u2019s hand to the lock, but Peter tries with all his\nmight to fight back.</p><p>\u201cKaren <i>don\u2019t.</i>\u201d\nPeter warned, a ferocity he hadn\u2019t shown to anyone but the punching bags in the\nAvengers compound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Peter. I overstepped my mark.\u201d KAREN replies, but\nas she does; Peter mumbles an \u2018it\u2019s okay\u2019 and begins to unlock the door.</p><p>When the door opens he can\u2019t help being overwhelmed by the\nsmell of you. He lets his mask flutter away and as the smell fully hits his\nface, he shuts the door and just cries. Cries that he didn\u2019t do more, cries that\nhe wished that he was never dusted, cries that Mr. Stark wasn\u2019t here to help\nhim cope. </p><p>When Peter finally looked around the living room it broke\nhis heart. Back at the Avengers compound you\u2019d always have tons of plants; on\nevery desk in every room. But due to recent neglect they weren\u2019t looking in\ngood shape. To start Peter\u2019s journey, he thought the best thing to ease him\ninto it was to grab the small watering can you had beside one of your bigger\nplants, fill it up and begin to water them. The small maintenance still made\nhim cry as it made him remember you effortlessly doing it with your powers, but\nhe had to salvage what life there was left of you. </p><p>Peter\u2019s last stop was arguably the hardest. Your bedroom.\nAnd even though he thought he was finished crying; when he saw the familiar\nshape of how you slept still there in your bedsheets and your phone still charging\non the bedside table; he felt himself tensing up. As he pressed the home button\non your phone it was flooded with notifications of regular things. But the most\nrecent ones were of Peter texting you; wishing that you were there.</p><p>He gives a small gulp and reaches into his spidey suit for\nhis phone, calling your number. He smiled at the dorky photo of him you used as\nhis contact photo, letting it fully ring out before a familiar message played.</p><p><i>\u2018Hi! It\u2019s Y/N, sorry I\ndidn\u2019t pick up but leave a message after the beep, BEEEEP!\u201d</i></p><p>Peter choked out a small sob at hearing your voice before\npromptly hanging up, as if you\u2019d pick it up and hear his voicemail and he\u2019d be\nembarrassed by it. Yet that would never happen.</p><p>\u201cPeter, there seems to be something on her desk.\u201d KAREN\npoints out, allowing Peter to be distracted from the sombre situation he had\nput himself in. A blue hologram light pours out the suit and to a large open\nbook. There were others similar looking stacked beside it, and as Peter moved\nthe pen away; he realised it was a diary.</p><p><i>\u2018Day 1,835</i></p><p><i>Today\u2019s the day we\u2019re\ngoing to try and pull off this \u2018Time Heist\u2019 thing, and I can\u2019t express how much\nI hope it\u2019ll work. God I miss my friends\u2026 but I God I miss my dumb idiot Peter\nParker\u2019</i></p><p>Peter smiles as he sees his name, wiping away his tears as to\nnot smudge the ink of his pen.</p><p><i>\u2018If Peter comes back,\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do with him. I\u2019ll probably never let him go. I\u2019ll never\nlet him see the diaries I\u2019ve kept for 5 years. I\u2019ll name my saga \u20185 years\ncrying over Peter Parker\u2019. I would never want Peter to do that over me.\u2019</i></p><p>Peter squeezed his eyes shut. Knowing exactly that was what\nhe was doing now.</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m so proud of\neveryone, we\u2019ve done so much and we\u2019re going to do so much. I don\u2019t want to get\nmy hopes up too much, but I can\u2019t wait to see Peter.</i></p><p><i>Goodnight Peter\nParker, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.</i></p><p><i>Y/N\u2019</i></p><p>At your final closing statement, Peter uses his gloved hand\nto stop a sob escaping.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d KAREN\u2019s voice is soft.</p><p>\u201cYes- K-Karen?\u201d He sniffs, trying to compose himself; even\nif it\u2019s just an AI</p><p>\u201cYou should listen to her.\u201d She starts, letting Peter\nprocess the information. \u201cBut I think you should also take her plants back to\nyours and Aunt May\u2019s apartment. Bring a little of Y/N\u2019s life to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Karen.\u201d Peter closes the book and places it on\ntop of the 4 others that were neatly stacked beside it. \u201cI think so too.\u201d<br/></p>",

This was\nit, Peter stared at those keys for what felt like hours but was most likely\nabout 10 minutes. Until he finally decided to bite the bullet. He grabbed them and\npulled his mask over his face.</p><p>Peter swung through the streets, having KAREN help him with\nthe navigation. When he arrived at your apartment door, Peter couldn\u2019t help but\njust stare again.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Why aren\u2019t you heading in?\u201d KAREN asked him as she\ntoo could only stare at your door. Your last name in metallic letters beneath\nthe door number.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know Karen. It-It\u2019s like I can\u2019t move.\u201d Peter\nclenched his jaw as he tried to not cry with his mask on, but it was true. He felt\nlike his entire body was frozen in this one spot and would be forever.</p><p>\u201cI can help you with that Peter if you-\u201c KAREN starts to use\nher technology to move Peter\u2019s hand to the lock, but Peter tries with all his\nmight to fight back.</p><p>\u201cKaren <i>don\u2019t.</i>\u201d\nPeter warned, a ferocity he hadn\u2019t shown to anyone but the punching bags in the\nAvengers compound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Peter. I overstepped my mark.\u201d KAREN replies, but\nas she does; Peter mumbles an \u2018it\u2019s okay\u2019 and begins to unlock the door.</p><p>When the door opens he can\u2019t help being overwhelmed by the\nsmell of you. He lets his mask flutter away and as the smell fully hits his\nface, he shuts the door and just cries. Cries that he didn\u2019t do more, cries that\nhe wished that he was never dusted, cries that Mr. Stark wasn\u2019t here to help\nhim cope. </p><p>When Peter finally looked around the living room it broke\nhis heart. Back at the Avengers compound you\u2019d always have tons of plants; on\nevery desk in every room. But due to recent neglect they weren\u2019t looking in\ngood shape. To start Peter\u2019s journey, he thought the best thing to ease him\ninto it was to grab the small watering can you had beside one of your bigger\nplants, fill it up and begin to water them. The small maintenance still made\nhim cry as it made him remember you effortlessly doing it with your powers, but\nhe had to salvage what life there was left of you. </p><p>Peter\u2019s last stop was arguably the hardest. Your bedroom.\nAnd even though he thought he was finished crying; when he saw the familiar\nshape of how you slept still there in your bedsheets and your phone still charging\non the bedside table; he felt himself tensing up. As he pressed the home button\non your phone it was flooded with notifications of regular things. But the most\nrecent ones were of Peter texting you; wishing that you were there.</p><p>He gives a small gulp and reaches into his spidey suit for\nhis phone, calling your number. He smiled at the dorky photo of him you used as\nhis contact photo, letting it fully ring out before a familiar message played.</p><p><i>\u2018Hi! It\u2019s Y/N, sorry I\ndidn\u2019t pick up but leave a message after the beep, BEEEEP!\u201d</i></p><p>Peter choked out a small sob at hearing your voice before\npromptly hanging up, as if you\u2019d pick it up and hear his voicemail and he\u2019d be\nembarrassed by it. Yet that would never happen.</p><p>\u201cPeter, there seems to be something on her desk.\u201d KAREN\npoints out, allowing Peter to be distracted from the sombre situation he had\nput himself in. A blue hologram light pours out the suit and to a large open\nbook. There were others similar looking stacked beside it, and as Peter moved\nthe pen away; he realised it was a diary.</p><p><i>\u2018Day 1,835</i></p><p><i>Today\u2019s the day we\u2019re\ngoing to try and pull off this \u2018Time Heist\u2019 thing, and I can\u2019t express how much\nI hope it\u2019ll work. God I miss my friends\u2026 but I God I miss my dumb idiot Peter\nParker\u2019</i></p><p>Peter smiles as he sees his name, wiping away his tears as to\nnot smudge the ink of his pen.</p><p><i>\u2018If Peter comes back,\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do with him. I\u2019ll probably never let him go. I\u2019ll never\nlet him see the diaries I\u2019ve kept for 5 years. I\u2019ll name my saga \u20185 years\ncrying over Peter Parker\u2019. I would never want Peter to do that over me.\u2019</i></p><p>Peter squeezed his eyes shut. Knowing exactly that was what\nhe was doing now.</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m so proud of\neveryone, we\u2019ve done so much and we\u2019re going to do so much. I don\u2019t want to get\nmy hopes up too much, but I can\u2019t wait to see Peter.</i></p><p><i>Goodnight Peter\nParker, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.</i></p><p><i>Y/N\u2019</i></p><p>At your final closing statement, Peter uses his gloved hand\nto stop a sob escaping.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d KAREN\u2019s voice is soft.</p><p>\u201cYes- K-Karen?\u201d He sniffs, trying to compose himself; even\nif it\u2019s just an AI</p><p>\u201cYou should listen to her.\u201d She starts, letting Peter\nprocess the information. \u201cBut I think you should also take her plants back to\nyours and Aunt May\u2019s apartment. Bring a little of Y/N\u2019s life to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Karen.\u201d Peter closes the book and places it on\ntop of the 4 others that were neatly stacked beside it. \u201cI think so too.\u201d<br></p>",

One entire month Peter had not only\nlost his 3<sup>rd</sup> father figure, but also the love of his life. It hurt\nhim to look anywhere as despite the Avengers compound having been completely wrecked\ndue to the battle, the bits where you had spruced up greenery or grown trees or\nmade small ponds around the surrounding area had completely disappeared.</p><p>After the avengers were rehabilitated to another minor compound,\nPeter would come there to train for hours and hours. Happy would have to tell\nPeter to stop and go home because he would have school the next day and it was\n4am. Your presence had affected everyone significantly and now without you, the\nworld did seem a little darker.</p><p>One late Friday night, Peter&rsquo;s tired eyes made their way to\nthe compound. Ready to talk to Karen for hours as he pushed himself to the limit.\nHe should&rsquo;ve done more. He should&rsquo;ve helped you. Every single time he tried to\nsleep he couldn&rsquo;t help but see your lifeless body as he tried his best to keep\nyou here.</p><p>So as Peter was ready for the automatic doors to open to the\ntraining room, he was surprised to\nfind it shut. This minor inconvenience not playing to how he wanted his night\nto go. He decided to head upstairs to hopefully unlocking it.</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce, Bucky? Anyone?&rdquo; Peter shouted out into the building,\nbut nothing came of it. As he headed up to the main quarters, he saw a little\nnote left upon the table. As Peter approached the table, a pang in his heart\nwas forever present as he picked up the note. It had your address on it.</p><p><i>&lsquo;Y/N wouldn&rsquo;t want you\nto cry over her kid.
