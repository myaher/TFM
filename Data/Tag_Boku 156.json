Here are my thoughts:</p><p>1. <b>Dad for One Theory</b>. I just reblogged this one! There is a lot of evidence for it, a lot of good evidence, but like I said, I hope it\u2019s not true. I just hope that Horikoshi is showing how similar the heroes and the villains really are in order to make the villains more sympathetic, maybe, or even Deku<i> less</i> sympathetic? I would applaud Hori much harder of this was the case. It just feels too predictable, too trite, and too much like other shounen. MHA is already so unique with the way it plays with tropes&ndash; I really hope that it subverts our expectations with this one, too.</p><p>2. <b>All Might will Die Protecting Someone Else Despite Not Having One for All. </b>Listen, I can get behind this one. I have a strong feeling All Might isn\u2019t going to live to see the end of the series. Which&hellip; :( But it\u2019s true! And I also could totally seeing it being Bakugo or Endeavor. I totally caught the similarities between Deku/Bakugo and All Might/Endeavor! And since Endeavor is becoming a bigger face in the series now, I could imagine that it would be him. And that is such a good point about the next generation needing to become better people than the last, something I hope to explore in my fics here soon. Personally, I\u2019m not sure how I would want something like this to play out, there are strong arguments for either, but I really like this theory!\u00a0\u201cEndeavor is what Bakugo would\u2019ve become if he\u2019d stayed on the same path&ndash;\u201d Absolutely.</p><p><b>3. Bakugo will have some interaction with Endeavor. </b>This theory uses lots of info from the above one, all of which I totally agree with. I would love for Kacchan to have a moment of self reflection, thinking. \u201cOh, God. That could have been <i>me.\u201d</i></p><p>4. <b>References to Greek and Buddhist legends. </b>This is the kind of thing I love, love, love seeing in stories! Particularly, the parallels to how you explained Buddhism are <i>strong</i>. This is something I didn\u2019t know about, so thank you for sharing this one with me! Shiozaki potentially being Christian is also a very strong one. This was very enlightening, thanks!</p><p>5. <b>Deku will be suspected to be the traitor</b>. Remember that text post about Izuku accidentally losing his Quirk books and the League finding them and everyone wondering why they suddenly know all their strategies? Lol. This one would be so <i>angsty,</i> good lord. Nedzu losing his position makes me think there will be an Umbridge type who replaces him, if that\u2019s the direction Hori goes. (Which. <i>Yikers.</i>) I\u2019m actually kind of surprised that no one is suspicious about Deku already, maybe not in a malicious way, but definitely in a\u00a0\u201call this crap is happening and you\u2019re still acting shady are you ok?\u201d kind of way. The more evidence you went through, the worse it looks for him. This would be a very interesting subplot, maybe even with some of his friends doubting him? I think only his very close friends such as Tenya, Ochako, Kacchan, and Shoto would have 100% no reason to doubt him, since at least one of them was there during all the potential damning occasions. I like this one, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing it at all!</p><p>6. <b>Endeavor will lose his Quirk.</b> I\u2019m kind of shaky on this one, since Hori has said he\u2019s never head of Avatar and the parallels were unintentional lol. All Might already lost his, very publicly, so repeating such a thing will lose its impact, I think! Unless Endeavor isn\u2019t the only one to lose his Quirk, and several other top heroes do as well. Then, it becomes terrifying.</p><p>7. <b>All Might won\u2019t save Shigaraki but Endeavor will save Dabi</b>. This would be such a sweet thing to see. I agree with pretty much everything <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muc6fJZTj2HAOeLolOYsX9Q\">@hamliet</a> said. All Might and Shigaraki was foreshadowed to be a very big deal in the coming arcs, especially with his connection to Nana. I would really like to see something happen between these two, and it seems like too big of a plot thread that Shigaraki left dangling&ndash; just like he left Stain\u2019s arc unresolved, and I believe we\u2019ll see him again. Will this play into my feelings that All Might won\u2019t survive the series? Maybe. I have a hard time determining whether Hori will put All Might\u2019s focus on one or both of them, or leave Izuku to it! I could see it happening, though. And I don\u2019t think Endeavor will save Dabi, either. I think it\u2019ll be Shoto. That would leave nice parallels between them and Izuku/Shigaraki, because I do think Deku will try to save him. I really don\u2019t know if it&rsquo;ll be permanently, though.</p><p>But oh my god guys. Nana\u2019s alive inside of Deku. Does she know her grandson\u2019s fate? What will happen when she finds out?</p><p><i>And what will happen to Deku because of it?</i></p>",

Here are my thoughts:</p><p>1. <b>Dad for One Theory</b>. I just reblogged this one! There is a lot of evidence for it, a lot of good evidence, but like I said, I hope it\u2019s not true. I just hope that Horikoshi is showing how similar the heroes and the villains really are in order to make the villains more sympathetic, maybe, or even Deku<i> less</i> sympathetic? I would applaud Hori much harder of this was the case. It just feels too predictable, too trite, and too much like other shounen. MHA is already so unique with the way it plays with tropes\u2013 I really hope that it subverts our expectations with this one, too.</p><p>2. <b>All Might will Die Protecting Someone Else Despite Not Having One for All. </b>Listen, I can get behind this one. I have a strong feeling All Might isn\u2019t going to live to see the end of the series. Which\u2026 :( But it\u2019s true! And I also could totally seeing it being Bakugo or Endeavor. I totally caught the similarities between Deku/Bakugo and All Might/Endeavor! And since Endeavor is becoming a bigger face in the series now, I could imagine that it would be him. And that is such a good point about the next generation needing to become better people than the last, something I hope to explore in my fics here soon. Personally, I\u2019m not sure how I would want something like this to play out, there are strong arguments for either, but I really like this theory!\u00a0\u201cEndeavor is what Bakugo would\u2019ve become if he\u2019d stayed on the same path\u2013\u201d Absolutely.</p><p><b>3. Bakugo will have some interaction with Endeavor. </b>This theory uses lots of info from the above one, all of which I totally agree with. I would love for Kacchan to have a moment of self reflection, thinking. \u201cOh, God. That could have been <i>me.\u201d</i></p><p>4. <b>References to Greek and Buddhist legends. </b>This is the kind of thing I love, love, love seeing in stories! Particularly, the parallels to how you explained Buddhism are <i>strong</i>. This is something I didn\u2019t know about, so thank you for sharing this one with me! Shiozaki potentially being Christian is also a very strong one. This was very enlightening, thanks!</p><p>5. <b>Deku will be suspected to be the traitor</b>. Remember that text post about Izuku accidentally losing his Quirk books and the League finding them and everyone wondering why they suddenly know all their strategies? Lol. This one would be so <i>angsty,</i> good lord. Nedzu losing his position makes me think there will be an Umbridge type who replaces him, if that\u2019s the direction Hori goes. (Which. <i>Yikers.</i>) I\u2019m actually kind of surprised that no one is suspicious about Deku already, maybe not in a malicious way, but definitely in a\u00a0\u201call this crap is happening and you\u2019re still acting shady are you ok?\u201d kind of way. The more evidence you went through, the worse it looks for him. This would be a very interesting subplot, maybe even with some of his friends doubting him? I think only his very close friends such as Tenya, Ochako, Kacchan, and Shoto would have 100% no reason to doubt him, since at least one of them was there during all the potential damning occasions. I like this one, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing it at all!</p><p>6. <b>Endeavor will lose his Quirk.</b> I\u2019m kind of shaky on this one, since Hori has said he\u2019s never head of Avatar and the parallels were unintentional lol. All Might already lost his, very publicly, so repeating such a thing will lose its impact, I think! Unless Endeavor isn\u2019t the only one to lose his Quirk, and several other top heroes do as well. Then, it becomes terrifying.</p><p>7. <b>All Might won\u2019t save Shigaraki but Endeavor will save Dabi</b>. This would be such a sweet thing to see. I agree with pretty much everything <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muc6fJZTj2HAOeLolOYsX9Q\">@hamliet</a> said. All Might and Shigaraki was foreshadowed to be a very big deal in the coming arcs, especially with his connection to Nana. I would really like to see something happen between these two, and it seems like too big of a plot thread that Shigaraki left dangling\u2013 just like he left Stain\u2019s arc unresolved, and I believe we\u2019ll see him again. Will this play into my feelings that All Might won\u2019t survive the series? Maybe. I have a hard time determining whether Hori will put All Might\u2019s focus on one or both of them, or leave Izuku to it! I could see it happening, though. And I don\u2019t think Endeavor will save Dabi, either. I think it\u2019ll be Shoto. That would leave nice parallels between them and Izuku/Shigaraki, because I do think Deku will try to save him. I really don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be permanently, though.</p><p>But oh my god guys. Nana\u2019s alive inside of Deku. Does she know her grandson\u2019s fate? What will happen when she finds out?</p><p><i>And what will happen to Deku because of it?</i></p></p>",
