        "body": "<p>Theres a story of how humans were originally connected to the one who they would spend life with, platonic or romantic. But the gods decided the human connection like that was too powerful and separated each pair. Some were lucky and found each other again. Others decided it was time to find a new match. The way you find your match is by hugging them. The indication is you swap eye color.\u00a0</p><ul><li>Enter Andi and Amber. The skeptic and the believer. Andi who\u2019ll read stories of people discovering their soulmate and grinning when she sees her parents eyes reflect each other.<br/></li><li>Amber who wishes these stupid stories would stop because not all soulmate stories turn out like that, look at her parents unhappily sticking together because of a story.\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Then Jonah happens and she thinks this is proof that even if you aren\u2019t soulmates you can be happy with someone else! Hes sweet, funny and likes listening to her. She almost wishes after their first hug that her eyes would change to that deep green.\u00a0</li><li>But Andi Mack appears and Jonah is obviously liking the girl, the look back, how he taught her frisbee and the bracelet. She becomes resigned to the fact that no matter what her relationships won\u2019t work.</li><li>Jonah and Andi break up and Libby comes along, she and Jonah click like puzzle pieces and give each other a hug. Its no surprise when their eyes switch colors almost immediately.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>Andi Mack reaches out though and becomes her friend. Who would have thought that both of Jonahs exes would become best friends! Andi is funny and way too invested in soulmates but she also laughs at Ambers jokes and gives her a second chance after the Ferris Wheel and visits her at the Spoon to ta- oh no.</li><li>She and Jonah are great exes so she calls him immediately\u00a0</li><li><b>Amber: </b>JONAH TELL ME THE TRUTH IS ANDI CUTE?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b>Jonah: </b>Amber&hellip;are you okay?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b>Amber:</b> I am having a crush disaster please h e l p</li><li>Andi is cautious about her hugs if shes going to be honest. She doesn\u2019t want to miss the one where her eyes begin to change. Amber isn\u2019t comfortable with hugs but sometimes she\u2019ll grab her hand and they\u2019ll smile at each other. It makes her feel happy like when Walker made her the shoes.\u00a0</li><li>They go the Andi Shack one day and Amber is in awe. Theres so many things to create and a CD lamp??? She is totally on board and they spend the day creating bracelets and laughing at each others funky doodles or necklaces.\u00a0</li><li>Amber notices various paper cranes around and asks about them. Andi picks one up\u00a0\u201cWell Cece was going to sell the house so I tried to make a thousand of these to get a wish, I reached 998 before they decided they weren\u2019t going to sell so it worked!\u201d\u00a0</li><li>Amber is like !!! Can I make the last two and one of us can make a wish?\u00a0</li><li>Andi shows her how to make a crane and while the first one is lopsided it works. She helps her make one more and then Andi smiles\u00a0\u201cHow about you get the wish?\u201d she shrugs and writes her wish on the last crane, hoping it might come true.\u00a0</li><li>The crane goes home with Amber so she can check if the wish comes true sometime. It doesn\u2019t that night. But even if she doesn\u2019t know it the wish will come true very soon.\u00a0</li><li>Fast forward to summer, they are canoeing in the lake. Andi has gotten a little bit better at staying in the boat but still they\u2019ve flipped a few times. They agree to try one more time to get across the lake\u00a0</li><li>Spoiler: They flip</li><li>But something happens when Andi\u2019s life jacket slips off, Amber immediately swims over and loops her arm around her so they can grab the lifejacket.</li><li>After they reach shore they head into the bathroom to dry off and change. Amber is still breaks into giggles when thinking about Andis shocked face when they fell again.\u00a0</li><li>She walks into the bathroom to find Andi staring at the mirror.\u00a0</li><li>\u201cBambi? I know we got wet but its nothing we can\u2019t fix\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo no its not that, come over here\u201d</li><li>Amber comes over, worried that shes hurt and stops. Oh my god. Andis eyes are turning bluish-green. And hers are turning brown.\u00a0</li><li>Needless to say there is a lot of freaking out. Yeah we thought each other was very cute but this???\u00a0</li><li>Its Andis dream and Ambers nightmare.\u00a0</li><li><b>Andi (internally): </b>OH MY GOD YES ITS AMBER I AM SO HAPPY</li><li><b>Amber (internally):</b> YAY ITS ANDI BUT HOLY HECK THIS IS BAD</li><li>Andi realizes she is freaking out a bit and gets her to sit down, remembering how Ambers parents have turned out as soulmates.\u00a0</li><li>After breathing for a few minutes Amber feels like she can talk without crying or screaming</li><li>They sit by the lake and braid flower crowns while talking. (Ambers is purple lilac and Andis is ambrosia)</li><li>After talking through it a bit Amber admits she already had a crush on Andi and was having fun hanging out, soulmates or not. Andi was hesitant to say anything because of the ferris wheel making her doubt it and she wasn\u2019t sure if they were soulmates or not.</li><li>Nothing happens then but they both go home, oddly satisfied and very happy</li><li>The fair is coming back into town and Amber decides its a now or never shot\u00a0\u201cHey Bambi?

Andi was hesitant to say anything because of the ferris wheel making her doubt it and she wasn&rsquo;t sure if they were soulmates or not.</li><li>Nothing happens then but they both go home, oddly satisfied and very happy</li><li>The fair is coming back into town and Amber decides its a now or never shot&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey Bambi? Would you want to go to the fair with me? As in a date?&rdquo;&nbsp;</li><li>She says yes immediately!!</li><li>In the end both of them have a great time and are really happy with each other. And if they kiss on top of the ferris wheel well then good for them &lt;3&nbsp;</li><li>Bonus: Amber starts to deconstruct what soulmates are and realizes while her parents didn&rsquo;t work out, she and Andi will.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This is dedicated to (sorry if this is weird):&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3EOu5JFaQ22e0aezi7yabw\">@bambikippen</a>.
