In this part, we will examine how she has done actual ruling.\u00a0I will present this part mostly with pictures, and I can\u2019t wait to see Sansa proving herself as a true leader in season 8.</p><p>Before glancing through her term as the Regent in the North while Jon was away on his mission, I\u2019d also like to highlight an event in season 6 that proved her potential as a leader.</p><h2><b>She has a strategic mind</b></h2><p>Sansa didn\u2019t have any knowledge about battle, but she has common sense.

So Jon would have had no choice but to lay siege to the castle, which made it even harder to defeat Ramsay, since the weather was becoming more severe.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in any case, it was smart of Sansa to ask for reinforcement.</p><hr /><h2><b>An excellent administrator</b></h2><p>Now we briefly revisit her term as the Lady of Winterfell.

While Jon and his troop were camping to prepare for the battle against Ramsay, Sansa noticed that the Northern men and the wildings didn&rsquo;t get along with each other.

She understood that with a disorganized, un-united, and indisciplined forced like that, they stood no chance against the Boltons, who were larger in number and more disciplined.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a040ecff492fd1123d3617df484de50/tumblr_inline_p16steY3WX1v86ltz_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure>\n</p>",

Also in the latter portion of this meta, I will be introducing the possibility that a specific character has been tortured and sexually assaulted since season seven. \u00a0</i></p><p>Within a story\u2019s framework, mirrors can draw connections amongst characters and events and can convey conscious/subconscious thoughts, truth vs lies, etc. \u00a0<b>In a reference to the practice of hydromancy, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> contains a basin of water, Galadriel\u2019s mirror, that provides visions of the past, present, and possible future</b>.

Inspired by Tolkien\u2019s device, GRRM uses mirrors not only in an allegorical manner in his series A Song of Ice and Fire (e.g. Sansa Stark as the positive mirror image to Cersei Lannister) but also to <i><b>consistently foreshadow major events with water as well as to allude to previous scenes that haven\u2019t yet been revealed to the reader</b></i> (this will later compare to Melisandre\u2019s pyromancy). <br></p><h2><b>Of particular note, both Arya Stark\u2019s confrontation with Joffrey Lannister alongside the waters of the Trident and D\u00e6ny\u2019s clash with her brother Viserys in the midst of the \u201cDothraki Sea\u201d serve to FORESHADOW THE CLIMAX OF THE ENTIRE SERIES. <br></b></h2><p>GRRM successfully misdirects his readers and builds suspense though by also utilizing inversions, parallels, and <i>consistently and purposefully leaving out scenes</i>. Just as GRRM emulates and references multiple primary sources in his narrative, the show writers have looked at the most successful adaptations of the material that inspired him in their creation of the television show. \u00a0<i><b>In fact, this upcoming season will be tying together narrative threads in a major plot point that was seemingly inspired by Peter Jackson\u2019s adaptation of LoTR. <br></b></i></p><h2>Examining GRRM\u2019s narrative techniques within the text itself and to his literary/historical sources reveals a great deal about Game of Thrones Season Eight, such as <b>\u201cThe Kidnapping Plot\u201d, \u201cThe Parentage Reveal\u201d, \u201cWill D\u00e6ny get her house with the red door?\u201d<br></b></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><b>MIRRORS:</b></h2><h2><b>1.

Also in the latter portion of this meta, I will be introducing the possibility that a specific character has been tortured and sexually assaulted since season seven. &nbsp;</i></p><p>Within a story&rsquo;s framework, mirrors can draw connections amongst characters and events and can convey conscious/subconscious thoughts, truth vs lies, etc. &nbsp;<b>In a reference to the practice of hydromancy, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> contains a basin of water, Galadriel&rsquo;s mirror, that provides visions of the past, present, and possible future</b>. Inspired by Tolkien&rsquo;s device, GRRM uses mirrors not only in an allegorical manner in his series A Song of Ice and Fire (e.g. Sansa Stark as the positive mirror image to Cersei Lannister) but also to <i><b>consistently foreshadow major events with water as well as to allude to previous scenes that haven&rsquo;t yet been revealed to the reader</b></i> (this will later compare to Melisandre&rsquo;s pyromancy). <br /></p><h2><b>Of particular note, both Arya Stark&rsquo;s confrontation with Joffrey Lannister alongside the waters of the Trident and D&aelig;ny&rsquo;s clash with her brother Viserys in the midst of the &ldquo;Dothraki Sea&rdquo; serve to FORESHADOW THE CLIMAX OF THE ENTIRE SERIES. <br /></b></h2><p>GRRM successfully misdirects his readers and builds suspense though by also utilizing inversions, parallels, and <i>consistently and purposefully leaving out scenes</i>. Just as GRRM emulates and references multiple primary sources in his narrative, the show writers have looked at the most successful adaptations of the material that inspired him in their creation of the television show. &nbsp;<i><b>In fact, this upcoming season will be tying together narrative threads in a major plot point that was seemingly inspired by Peter Jackson&rsquo;s adaptation of LoTR. <br /></b></i></p><h2>Examining GRRM&rsquo;s narrative techniques within the text itself and to his literary/historical sources reveals a great deal about Game of Thrones Season Eight, such as <b>&ldquo;The Kidnapping Plot&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Parentage Reveal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Will D&aelig;ny get her house with the red door?&rdquo;<br /></b></h2><h2><br /></h2><h2><b>MIRRORS:</b></h2><h2><b>1.

On stage, Bianca&rsquo;s feelings and murderous plans for Lady Crane foreshadow Cersei&rsquo;s targeting of Sansa. When the action moves back-stage as the actors remove costumes and wigs in front of mirrors, most of the doubles change but <b>Lady Crane remains the stand-in for Sansa (e.g. the other actors&rsquo; comments that the crowd loves Lady Crane references book!Sansa&rsquo;s pledge in A Clash of Kings: &ldquo;&hellip; IF I AM EVER A QUEEN, I WILL MAKE THEM LOVE ME&rdquo;)</b>.&nbsp; <br /></p><h2>The writers make this point irrefutable when they both acknowledge the criticism levied against them <b>(Lady Crane: &ldquo;The writing&rsquo;s no good&rdquo;)</b> at the same time as they <b>foreshadow how they plan on elevating the series from everything else that has come before it with Arya&rsquo;s response: &ldquo;(<i>this story</i>) would all just be (<i>more of the same</i>) without (<i>Sansa the subversive heroine</i>).&rdquo;</b><br /></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/35e55be0abf6bd52ce791d5a9b521e03/tumblr_inline_ppyisjFcIJ1vt7896_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2>Just as the threats to Lady Crane shifts, Sansa/the Starks will be targeted by a different force mid-way through the season when <b>ALL of the Stark siblings/cousins will be involved in a violent stand-off, which will center on the FATE OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF STARKS</b>.<b><br /></b></h2><h2><b>2.

Coincidentally, as D&aelig;ny is the inverse of the main male character, Jon Snow is the positive mirror of one of the main supporting characters in the same play.

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",
