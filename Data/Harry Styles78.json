Harry had left shortly after dinner, indicating that he should probably look for Dani. It was an eventful two days, to say the least, but Y/N felt a little better sharing some of her internal hardships to people that will comfort and support her.</p><p>She was on her way to class when the sighting of a familiar man made her slow her pace down in order to watch his interaction with Dani. Niall and her sister were talking to each other animatedly, and she would\u2019ve loved to stay and watch but she really had to get going. <i>He should too,</i> Y/N thought, since they were in the same class after all.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Y/N. How was your weekend?</i>\u201d Niall greeted her cheerily, taking a seat on the chair beside her. She looked at him for a few seconds, debating if she had the right to ask what she wanted to question.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Why were you talking to Daniela?\u201d </b>Sh</i>e interrogated, hands playing with each other as a nervous habit.</p><p>\u201c<i>Ah, thought I saw you walk past, didn\u2019t even say hi to me,\u201d </i>Niall bore a grin towards her, avoiding the extent of her question. </p><p>Y/N knew that Harry felt more comfortable keeping their relationships to themselves, not because he was embarrassed by her; but because he wanted to make sure that the person that he was with currently would be there for a long time. He explained to her some time ago and she understood since she was also quite iffy of Harry meeting her sister. So, she really didn\u2019t know many of Harry\u2019s friends, not aware that Niall was one of them. </p><p>\u201c<i><b>Sorry, had to get to class</b></i>,\u201d She shrugged her shoulders, pulling out a pen and notebook. \u201c<b><i>Are you gonna answer me?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cWoah, slow down tiger,</i>\u201d Niall widened his eyes at her intrusive question. \u201c<i>Well, just came to talk to her cause there\u2019s been some rumors going around,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N turned her shoulders to face him, interested in what he had to say and if she could do anything to help her sister out&ndash; after all, they were still relatives. \u201c<i>What kind of rumors?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Heard she stole her own sister\u2019 boyfriend,</i>\u201d Niall whispered, looking around as if he didn&rsquo;t want anybody else to know. \u201c<i>What a bitch! And that boyfriend\u2019s a fucking asshole,\u201d</i></p><p>She was alert, back extended to her full height as she let the next words fall out of her mouth, \u201c<b><i>Do you know t-their names?\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>Hmm well, I think her sister\u2019s name is Y/N? Not you though,</i>\u201d He tilted his chin to gesture at her. \u201c<i>And I dunno the boyfriend, but she\u2019s dating a new guy now,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOh really?</i></b>\u201d \u201c<i>Yeah, he\u2019s my best mate,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYour best mate?</i></b>\u201d Y/N stuttered out, feeling her heart start to pound. From the corner of her eye, she could see the professor walk down the angled slope towards the front of the lecture hall. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah. Harry Styles? Do you know him?\u201d</i> Niall asked, completely oblivious. \u201c<i>He was a dating a Y/N too,\u201d</i></p><p>She only gulped at him, \u201c<i>Funny, isn\u2019t it?</i>\u201d He continued, trailing off when the puzzle pieces fit with each other, <i>\u201cWait, d-did you&ndash; are you..?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N blinked, facing the front. She could feel Niall\u2019s blue eyes lingering on the side of her face, watching her with caution and what she\u2019s been used to recently&ndash;<i>empathy</i>. But, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Harry was over at Dani\u2019s apartment for the day. It was the first time that they\u2019ve met up since the disastrous dinner at her parents\u2019 house. Harry ducked down from the flying shoe that speedily whizzed past his head.</p><p>\u201c<i>That\u2019s funny, I thought boyfriends were supposed to support their girlfriend!</i>\u201d Dan\u2019s voice bellowed from the distance where she threw the shoe. </p><p>For the time that he was alone, Harry had confirmed to himself that he did&ndash;indeed&ndash; \u00a0still loves Y/N. He figured the feelings were pulling at his heart, but his talk with Carlos further exemplified the things he was feeling. Not only that, but the newfound knowledge about Dani\u2019s evil-doings had kicked him in the gut. </p><p><i>\u201cNot when you hurt people, Dani\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Now you care about Y/N?</i>\u201d She scoffed, rolling her eyes at him and Harry swore that that was all she did nowadays. </p><p><i>\u201cI always cared for her,\u201d </i></p><p>\u201c<i>Even when you fucked me in your bed while you were still together?</i>\u201d A ringing appeared near Harry\u2019s ears as if it was information that was hard to swallow. \u201c<i>You\u2019re lying to yourself,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou manipulated me,\u201d</i> Harry said, running a hand through his hair. <i>\u201cYou used me to hurt her and I let you,\u201d</i></p><p>Dani responded, &ldquo;<i>So what if I did? All my life the attention has been on her. Everybody prefers her and I can&rsquo;t stand it so I did what I had to do to make her feel like she deserves</i>,\u201d She crossed her arms across her chest, <i>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you left her,\u201d</i></p><p>&rdquo;<i>You\u2019re so jealous of her that you&rsquo;ve gone insane,</i>\u201d Harry twirled his finger against his temple, striding his long leg towards Dani, \u201c<i>We\u2019re over.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAm I supposed to be hurt by that?&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you truly loved me, it should.</i>&rdquo; It was a loose thread that Harry was pulling at. Through the short months of being with Dani, he couldn\u2019t help but develop fundamental feelings for her&ndash;he was only human after all, and being in a relationship can boggle with his mind. </p><p>\u201c<i>But I didn&rsquo;t</i>,\u201d And Harry really shouldn\u2019t have cared by that statement because he expected it. However, his desire to find a mate kicks in and he is met with the realization that he had neither a partner or a sentimental value of love. It\u2019s not like Y/N would take him back either. </p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like I just kicked a puppy,</i>\u201d Dani interrupts his train of thought. \u201c<i>You&rsquo;ll get over it quickly,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry was gobsmacked with the intensity of it all. He just found out that his own girlfriend lied to him about her childhood, and he realized his feelings for Y/N but now, he can\u2019t even do anything about it. What are the chances of her letting him talk to her, let alone <i>be</i> in the <i>same</i> room as her?</p><p>Daniela was a&ndash;very&ndash;cold woman to be able to do the thing she did. She could\u2019ve simply talked Y/N about how she felt; Harry was sure that Y/N would\u2019ve listened to her worries. But no, she was a bulldozer that attacked the moment she got the chance and Y/N was blinded by the idea of blood being thicker than water that she let herself get trampled by her own sister. </p><p>As for Harry, he found himself in a mindset the picked on everything he did wrong. Y/N was such a strong woman for handling things the way she did. When she answered the door for them, she greeted them in a civilized way&ndash;with a smile even. And when Dani insulted her right in front of their family, Y/N was dignified and didn\u2019t let it bother her but before she went upstairs again, Harry could see the pain in her eyes. She was crumbling and he could clearly identify that she was screaming for help; but not from him. Even if he was the last man on earth, and she was drowning; she\u2019d rather let herself fall freely than come back to him. </p><p>She had all the right to be hateful, but she didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t in her nature to cut people off and it came with its pros and cons. The good thing is, he could still walk up to her and have a conversation. The bad thing was that it probably wouldn\u2019t be very pleasant for both of them. Y/N would probably fight through wanting to punch his stupid face while Harry scoured his mind for something interesting to say. </p><p>Y/N deserved so much love&ndash;<i>love</i> that he didn\u2019t give her before because he was blinded by what he thought was love for Daniela. He thought that Y/N and he were a dead end and he flew before he could get hurt; not taking into account that he was hurting instead. <i>He was a selfish man,</i> he concurs. But he\u2019s changed, he could feel something different spiking through within him. He was more prepared this time, more knowledgeable and Harry promised himself that he wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice. </p><p>He had a plethora building up within him&ndash;<i>for Y/N</i>&ndash; but he wasn\u2019t allowed to give it to her no matter how much he wanted to. She won\u2019t accept. Frankly, he doesn\u2019t blame her. What he did was cruel&ndash;<i>too cruel</i>. In fact, he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll find a way to get back on his feet if Y/N did something similar to him; much less doing it on his own like Y/N was at the moment. He betrayed and abandoned her for her <i>own</i> sister. That\u2019s twofold the pain that one would go through a cheating partner.</p><p>Speaking of, he hasn\u2019t actually <i>talked</i> to her since, well, since they \u2018<i>broke up</i>.\u2019 If he felt bad before everything spilled, his feeling exacerbated when he saw her looking thinly and like she didn\u2019t get enough sleep. There was no use trying to conjure up reasons as to <i>why</i> her appearance changed because Harry knew deep inside that he was the reason why she wasn\u2019t taking care of herself. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>While Harry was mourning over a loss of great love, Y/N was being lifted off of her sorrows by the one and only Niall. Despite knowing each other for only a few weeks&ndash;close to a month&ndash; Y/N somehow found it in herself to let Niall in through her high walls and thick skin. She let him see that parts of her that she was afraid of because she felt like she could trust him. And so far, he made no action to disprove her conclusion. He was different, but she was still wary. </p><p>Niall and Y/N were getting close and closer each day. They started hanging out outside of class time. They started talking about other topics and not only about the project they\u2019d been assigned. Niall saw more of Y/N coming out of her shell, and she watched as the usually bubbly boy became vulnerable in the confines of her apartment walls.</p><p>\u201c<i>Chocolate is better than vanilla!</i>\u201d Niall exclaimed at her, spoon digging inside his pudding cup. \u201c<i>Change my mind,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N made a muffled sound with closed lips. Her mouth is filled by vanilla pudding. She shook her head in disagreement,<b><i> \u201cNuh uh,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah huh,\u201d</i> He responded as he outstretched his hand out to hers, indirectly asking for her pudding cup so that he could throw it in the bin. She was almost done with it. </p><p><b><i>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Chocolate pudding is kind of bitter,\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cBut vanilla pudding is too sweet!\u201d </i>He grabbed her cup, heading to the attached kitchen to rinse out the remains before tossing it in the recycling bin. </p><p>As Y/N watched him being so domestic&ndash;being so caring for her&ndash; she realized that this was exactly how Harry acted in the early stage of their relationship. It seemed that she kept comparing Niall and Harry\u2019s actions, and she would always make herself sadder by the thought. Whatever Niall did, Harry would find a way to disclose the happy moment by reminding Y/N of what used to be and made her cautious of what could happen <i>again</i> if she let Niall come too close.</p><p>Y/N mumbled to herself quietly, trying to shut off the thoughts about how Niall will only hurt her. </p><p><i>\u201cWhat was that, Y/N?\u201d</i> He asked, plopping his bum down on the couch beside her. </p><p><b><i>\u201cI think you should leave</i></b>,\u201d She said so softly that Niall only got whisps of her sentence. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hmm? You wanna watch something else?</i>\u201d He grabbed the remote from the table in front of them. \u201c<i>I know you like rom-coms so maybe we\u2019ll watch that,\u201d</i></p><p>The TV flicked to the main menu. He browsed through the categories, briefly glancing at her. \u201c<i>Oi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI think you should leave,\u201d</i></b> Y/N said more sternly. Guilt was eating up her inside. Somehow, it felt wrong to have Niall over while she was still thinking of her ex-boyfriend. It wasn\u2019t fair to him either.</p><p>Her statement made him drop the remote on his lap. He winced a little but his eyes widened in surprise. His mouth opened and close, not knowing what to say when someone asks you to leave. \u201c<i>Oh, d-did I do something wrong?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head \u2018<i>no</i>\u2019. \u201c<b><i>I just&mdash; I have stuff to do and I won\u2019t be able to focus,\u201d</i></b></p><p>Niall nodded understandingly, but he was still discombobulated by the sudden request to exit the building. He stood up, grabbing his phone on the table before wrapping his arms in his coat that he had hung by the door. His hand grasped the doorknob, looking at her for a final time before he left. \u201c<i>Y/N,\u201d</i></p><p>She looked up to him from her position on the couch, the tears she\u2019d tried to dry out spilling a little over her waterline, \u201c<i>Yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d</i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Niall was worried for Y/N. Since the day she had asked him to leave, he hasn\u2019t seen much of her on campus. It was like she was avoiding him. Actually, he was certain that she <i>was</i> avoiding him because she recently switched seats to the other side of the room. She wouldn\u2019t even look on his direction, much less spare him a subtle wave or glance. He tried calling out her name one day after class, but he got no response from her. He could only watch as her head of hair disappeared among the mass crowd that hid her from him. </p><p>Y/N was disappointed in herself. She was aware of what she was doing this time. She was isolating herself and her pride wouldn\u2019t let her overcome the loop she\u2019d put herself in. Niall was getting closer to her faster than she had anticipated and it sent her into a frenzy. <i>Was she ready?</i> She didn\u2019t know if she was prepared to let somebody in again&ndash;even though Niall had squeezed himself in&ndash;she was scared.</p><p>She was shaking in her boots, teeth nipping on her fingernails as her eyes shifted from one corner of the room to the other because her mind couldn\u2019t stay quiet in the late hours of the night. Y/N was under the covers, hiding from the harsh reality of the world. <i>Would it be so wrong to let Niall in?</i> She so badly wanted to but there was a pull in her heart that warned her. She didn\u2019t know if she was being paranoid or there was something suspicious about Niall. </p><p>Nonetheless, Niall was very persistent in being in her life. He reached out to her in any way he knew how.; chased her after class, but she ignored it. He left voice messages on her phone when she failed to answer his calls. He spammed her with texts despite always being left on read. He was trying so hard and she was rejecting him with the same energy&ndash;pushing him away, yet he pushed back and with it, he polished off the ball that is Y/N\u2019s fear of abandonment, making it more real than she thought possible.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p><i>\u201cHey H</i>,\u201d Niall greeted as Harry opened the door to his apartment. He was over for the day to hang out and chill. The two boys haven\u2019t done so in a while, especially with exams and assignments running at full speed. </p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man?</i>\u201d Harry responded, leaning in for a hug.</p><p>Niall walked into the small living room&ndash;as Harry had instructed&ndash;while he gathered up some snacks and drinks to keep them filled while they caught up with each others\u2019 lives. Minutes later, Harry and his bowl filled arms came into view. </p><p>\u201c<i>How\u2019s you and Dani?</i>\u201d Niall questioned. He remembered how Y/N\u2019s face looked when they talked about the topic before, and he was antsy to confirm the truth. </p><p><i>\u201cWe broke up,</i>\u201d It was a solemn confession from him, but Harry was relieved.</p><p><i> \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>We just&ndash; we didn&rsquo;t work out</i>,\u201d Harry stuttered out an excuse. \u201c<i>How about you? Found anybody you like?\u201d</i></p><p>Niall cleared his throat, blinking rapidly as he was caught off guard of how quickly the question was directed to him. \u201c<i>Uh, yeah actually. Got my eye on someone,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cInnit?</i>\u201d Harry punched Niall\u2019s knee in a teasing manner, \u201c<i>What\u2019s her name? Do I know her?\u201d</i> He took a gulp from canned ice tea, filling his cheeks with the slightly chilled beverage. </p><p>\u201c<i>Her name\u2019s Y/N,</i>\u201d Niall watched carefully as Harry\u2019s eyes widened, fighting himself from spilling the liquid out of his mouth. <i>\u201cNot sure if it\u2019s *your Y/N, though,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry asked him what <i>that</i> Y/N looked like and from the way Niall as eyeing him cautiously, he knew that both of them were tiptoeing on a topic that was bound to make them face the truth. And when Niall described Y/N\u2019s appearance first, Harry couldn\u2019t help but envision a perfect image of her in his mind\u2014having not forgotten such a beautiful face. However, once Niall rambled in about her <i>\u2018perfect personality</i>\u2019; how she was nice and sweet, but humble and gentle\u2014Harry felt his heart hurting because that totally sounded like <i>his </i>Y/N.</p><p><i>\u201cDoes that sound like your Y/N?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry nodded, unable to deny something that was so undeniably true. It was quiet for minutes, neither of them saying a word to each other.</p><p>\u201c<i>Harry</i>,\u201d Niall began. <i>\u201cWere you\u2014did you leave Y/N for her sister?\u201d</i></p><p>He nodded hesitantly but nonetheless witnessed as hope vanished from Niall\u2019s baby blue eyes. He was praying that Harry wouldn\u2019t do such a thing, but he was proven wrong. \u201c<i>I did, yeah, I-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 not very nice,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that already?\u201d</i> Harry gassed, squinting his eyes. His nostrils were flaring from hearing the way Niall talked to him as if he didn\u2019t know that what he did was terrible. </p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t get angry at me! I\u2019m just saying</i>,\u201d Niall raised his hands up in the air. <i>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucked up man,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>I thought we were drifting. I had to get out before it got worse,</i>\u201d He gulped, trying to explain himself. \u201c<i>I didn\u2019t think I was gonna fall for Dani,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should\u2019ve talked to Y/N first?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Yes but sh-she,</i>\u201d Harry stuttered over his words. The simplest thing he could\u2019ve done to avoid this whole mess was to <i>talk</i> to Y/N, but it somehow managed to slip his mind. If he communicated with her, maybe they would\u2019ve fixed this and gone over the bump. <i>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m going to talk\u2014,\u201d</i></p><p>Niall phone buzzed loudly on the glass surface of the coffee table. He reached out to grab the device. \u201c<i>It\u2019s Y/N, I have to go,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry watched as Niall got up on his feet, waiting for him to do the same so he could bid him goodbye properly. The blonde patted the others\u2019 shoulder firmly as if to reprimand him of his wrongdoing. </p><p><i>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d </i></p><p>Niall looked over his shoulder, shrugging on his coat by the door. \u201c<i>Her place,\u201d </i></p><p>It was all Niall said before he unlocked the door and swung it open. Harry was left with his wandering thoughts that imagined filthy things going on between Y/N and his friend. He shook his head to get rid of them. </p><p>He sat on his love seat chair, legs spread widely as he covers his face with the expanse of his palm. He glanced up towards the ceiling, silently praying to a God that would be able to help him figure hot to cure the ache in his heart know that Y/N was progressing from him and slowly replacing him. He had no right to be angry but he couldn\u2019t help but want to burst into her place and blame her for moving on too fast; for not even trying to fix them before she let the fire between them simmer. But Harry knew that she was doing the best thing that she can for herself, and as much as he didn\u2019t want her to\u2014he was a selfish man and Harry wanted Y/N all to himself. </p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p><b><i>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done!</i></b>\u201d Y/N exclaimed excitedly from across Niall. They were in her bedroom, sat on her bed with papers surrounding both of them. Her laptop jostled over from her lap when she bounced from the knowledge that their efforts would soon dwindle when they finish this assignment. </p><p><i>\u201cOi, calm down Y/N. I have to focus,</i>\u201d Niall replied as he but his lip. Fingers typing on the keyboard to finish the last bits of information needed on the \u2018<i>reference</i>\u2019 page. </p><p>Y/N pouted at being reprimanded but she let her eyes dance on her own laptop screen as the pink line moved on the Google Doc that they were sharing. \u201c<i><b>Sorry, I\u2019m excited to relax,\u201d</b></i></p><p>It was true. Since Niall arrived, they\u2019ve hit it straight to the ballpark. They\u2019ve not had a break since hours ago and her stomach was rumbling with need. </p><p><i>\u201cAnd done!</i>\u201d Niall accentuated his words with a final tap to his keyboard\u2014submitting an assignment had never felt better than it did right at this moment. </p><p>Y/N gathered the papers in a neat pile before placing them in a blue folder. Niall shut down his computer, preparing to pack for his departure for the night. <i><b>\u201cWhere are you going, Ni?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He paused, halfway to zipping his bag when she asked him that. \u201c<i>Uh, my place?</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBut it\u2019s</b>,</i>\u201d Y/N glanced at her alarm clock. <i>\u201c<b>Eleven-thirty in the evening!\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u201c<i>So</i>?\u201d Niall raises his brows in confusion.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSo? You can\u2019t go out that late,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThen where am I supposed to sleep tonight,</i>\u201d He replied. Y/N thought the idea over her head and concluded that it wouldn\u2019t be too big of a deal to let Niall stay the night. </p><p><b><i>\u201cHere, of course,\u201d </i></b>She places her school materials on her desk, clearing her bed of any clutter. </p><p><i>\u201cYou want me,\u201d</i> He pointed at his chest. \u201c<i>To sleep here tonight?</i>\u201d Y/N nodded enthusiastically. </p><p>Y/N squealed as Niall landed on the spot beside her, body flopping against the mattress. He released a slight groan, \u201c<i>Ooo, your bed is comfy,\u201d </i></p><p>She giggled when he spread out his limbs purposely, shoving her off the bed eventually. \u201c<b><i>What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201c\u2018M a big guy, I need all the space I can get,\u201d</i> Y/N puffed air out from her tightly closed lips, mocking his words. </p><p><i><b>\u201cYou\u2019re not that big,\u201d </b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSize doesn\u2019t matter,</i>\u201d He mumbled the best he could with his cheek being squished against the soft pillows. </p><p>Y/N slapped his shoulder for his innuendo, instructing him to get up so that they could head to the kitchen and fix themselves some very late dinner. </p><p>Niall watched from his spot on her kitchen table as Y/N seemed to dance around from spot to spot, collecting ingredients and mixing them in the pot on the stove. His mouth watering with the delicious aroma wafting the air around him despite the exhaust fan above being turned on. </p><p><i>\u201cY/N, I have a question,\u201d</i> She hummed in response. \u201c<i>Did Harry leave you for Dani?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N paused her movements, arm stuck frozen from its stirring position. He couldn\u2019t see her face and she was glad because she was sure that it must\u2019ve morphed into a crumpled expression. </p><p><i>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t have to answer that,</i>\u201d Niall cleared his throat. \u201c<i>He was a jerk to do that. Harry, I mean,\u201d</i></p><p>He continued when Y/N didn\u2019t respond verbally. \u201c<i>I apologize for him. He\u2019s my friend and I\u2019m having a hard time comprehending that he could do something so vile,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I want you to know that he doesn\u2019t deserve you,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N felt the warmth of his body against the expanse her back and she was rendered frozen once again. <b><i>\u201cI know,\u201d </i></b></p><p>She could hear him chuckle breathily and for a moment, she smiled too.<i> \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get over him, you know,</b></i>\u201d She sighed, finally turning around, only to be met with his broad chest. She stared at the white shirt that covered his skin, thinking through her next words. <i><b>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cBut being with you,\u201d</i></b> Y/N lifted a hand up to his chest, letting a finger trace lightly. Niall\u2019s heart quickened its pace, she could tell from the increasingly deeper breaths he took. She swore she could feel his heartbeat pounding through the barriers. </p><p>His hands touched her lower back gently just after he switched the stove knob off. He was afraid to take her by surprise when he felt her body tense, but it soon relaxed against his touch. Niall was looking at the top of her head because of his height advantage, and he so badly wanted to tilt her chin up and bore his eyes into her pretty ones. </p><p><i><b>\u201cBut with you, it gets easier.\u201d </b></i></p><p>And maybe it was stupid of Harry to impulsively visit Y/N at the slither of dusk, and even stupider when he put his key&ndash;that he never gave back to her&ndash;in the keyhole because she wasn\u2019t answering the door. His mind was fuzzy and he wasn\u2019t thinking clearly; maybe his knocks were too light against the wood of the door. He thought Y/N was ignoring him because he can clearly see a crack of light from underneath in front of his feet. It was the stupidest thing to enter her apartment, ready to softly call out her name. He can smell the food she\u2019d always especially make for him&mdash;it wasn\u2019t just his mouth-watering, but his eyes as well because the root of the intoxicating scent was centered on the stove. He couldn\u2019t see the appliance because of two bodies blocking the way.\u00a0</p><p>He really wished that he\u2019d just waited behind the closed door and not witness the sight in front of him.</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>okay so I said I was recurringly posting part 4 with pt3 but im late sO O WELL.

Harry had left shortly after dinner, indicating that he should probably look for Dani. It was an eventful two days, to say the least, but Y/N felt a little better sharing some of her internal hardships to people that will comfort and support her.</p><p>She was on her way to class when the sighting of a familiar man made her slow her pace down in order to watch his interaction with Dani. Niall and her sister were talking to each other animatedly, and she would\u2019ve loved to stay and watch but she really had to get going. <i>He should too,</i> Y/N thought, since they were in the same class after all.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Y/N. How was your weekend?</i>\u201d Niall greeted her cheerily, taking a seat on the chair beside her. She looked at him for a few seconds, debating if she had the right to ask what she wanted to question.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Why were you talking to Daniela?\u201d </b>Sh</i>e interrogated, hands playing with each other as a nervous habit.</p><p>\u201c<i>Ah, thought I saw you walk past, didn\u2019t even say hi to me,\u201d </i>Niall bore a grin towards her, avoiding the extent of her question. </p><p>Y/N knew that Harry felt more comfortable keeping their relationships to themselves, not because he was embarrassed by her; but because he wanted to make sure that the person that he was with currently would be there for a long time. He explained to her some time ago and she understood since she was also quite iffy of Harry meeting her sister. So, she really didn\u2019t know many of Harry\u2019s friends, not aware that Niall was one of them. </p><p>\u201c<i><b>Sorry, had to get to class</b></i>,\u201d She shrugged her shoulders, pulling out a pen and notebook. \u201c<b><i>Are you gonna answer me?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cWoah, slow down tiger,</i>\u201d Niall widened his eyes at her intrusive question. \u201c<i>Well, just came to talk to her cause there\u2019s been some rumors going around,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N turned her shoulders to face him, interested in what he had to say and if she could do anything to help her sister out\u2013 after all, they were still relatives. \u201c<i>What kind of rumors?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Heard she stole her own sister\u2019 boyfriend,</i>\u201d Niall whispered, looking around as if he didn\u2019t want anybody else to know. \u201c<i>What a bitch! And that boyfriend\u2019s a fucking asshole,\u201d</i></p><p>She was alert, back extended to her full height as she let the next words fall out of her mouth, \u201c<b><i>Do you know t-their names?\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>Hmm well, I think her sister\u2019s name is Y/N? Not you though,</i>\u201d He tilted his chin to gesture at her. \u201c<i>And I dunno the boyfriend, but she\u2019s dating a new guy now,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOh really?</i></b>\u201d \u201c<i>Yeah, he\u2019s my best mate,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYour best mate?</i></b>\u201d Y/N stuttered out, feeling her heart start to pound. From the corner of her eye, she could see the professor walk down the angled slope towards the front of the lecture hall. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah. Harry Styles? Do you know him?\u201d</i> Niall asked, completely oblivious. \u201c<i>He was a dating a Y/N too,\u201d</i></p><p>She only gulped at him, \u201c<i>Funny, isn\u2019t it?</i>\u201d He continued, trailing off when the puzzle pieces fit with each other, <i>\u201cWait, d-did you\u2013 are you..?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N blinked, facing the front. She could feel Niall\u2019s blue eyes lingering on the side of her face, watching her with caution and what she\u2019s been used to recently\u2013<i>empathy</i>. But, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Harry was over at Dani\u2019s apartment for the day. It was the first time that they\u2019ve met up since the disastrous dinner at her parents\u2019 house. Harry ducked down from the flying shoe that speedily whizzed past his head.</p><p>\u201c<i>That\u2019s funny, I thought boyfriends were supposed to support their girlfriend!</i>\u201d Dan\u2019s voice bellowed from the distance where she threw the shoe. </p><p>For the time that he was alone, Harry had confirmed to himself that he did\u2013indeed\u2013 \u00a0still loves Y/N. He figured the feelings were pulling at his heart, but his talk with Carlos further exemplified the things he was feeling. Not only that, but the newfound knowledge about Dani\u2019s evil-doings had kicked him in the gut. </p><p><i>\u201cNot when you hurt people, Dani\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Now you care about Y/N?</i>\u201d She scoffed, rolling her eyes at him and Harry swore that that was all she did nowadays. </p><p><i>\u201cI always cared for her,\u201d </i></p><p>\u201c<i>Even when you fucked me in your bed while you were still together?</i>\u201d A ringing appeared near Harry\u2019s ears as if it was information that was hard to swallow. \u201c<i>You\u2019re lying to yourself,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou manipulated me,\u201d</i> Harry said, running a hand through his hair. <i>\u201cYou used me to hurt her and I let you,\u201d</i></p><p>Dani responded, \u201c<i>So what if I did? All my life the attention has been on her. Everybody prefers her and I can\u2019t stand it so I did what I had to do to make her feel like she deserves</i>,\u201d She crossed her arms across her chest, <i>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you left her,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201d<i>You\u2019re so jealous of her that you\u2019ve gone insane,</i>\u201d Harry twirled his finger against his temple, striding his long leg towards Dani, \u201c<i>We\u2019re over.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAm I supposed to be hurt by that?\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you truly loved me, it should.</i>\u201d It was a loose thread that Harry was pulling at. Through the short months of being with Dani, he couldn\u2019t help but develop fundamental feelings for her\u2013he was only human after all, and being in a relationship can boggle with his mind. </p><p>\u201c<i>But I didn\u2019t</i>,\u201d And Harry really shouldn\u2019t have cared by that statement because he expected it. However, his desire to find a mate kicks in and he is met with the realization that he had neither a partner or a sentimental value of love. It\u2019s not like Y/N would take him back either. </p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like I just kicked a puppy,</i>\u201d Dani interrupts his train of thought. \u201c<i>You\u2019ll get over it quickly,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry was gobsmacked with the intensity of it all. He just found out that his own girlfriend lied to him about her childhood, and he realized his feelings for Y/N but now, he can\u2019t even do anything about it. What are the chances of her letting him talk to her, let alone <i>be</i> in the <i>same</i> room as her?</p><p>Daniela was a\u2013very\u2013cold woman to be able to do the thing she did. She could\u2019ve simply talked Y/N about how she felt; Harry was sure that Y/N would\u2019ve listened to her worries. But no, she was a bulldozer that attacked the moment she got the chance and Y/N was blinded by the idea of blood being thicker than water that she let herself get trampled by her own sister. </p><p>As for Harry, he found himself in a mindset the picked on everything he did wrong. Y/N was such a strong woman for handling things the way she did. When she answered the door for them, she greeted them in a civilized way\u2013with a smile even. And when Dani insulted her right in front of their family, Y/N was dignified and didn\u2019t let it bother her but before she went upstairs again, Harry could see the pain in her eyes. She was crumbling and he could clearly identify that she was screaming for help; but not from him. Even if he was the last man on earth, and she was drowning; she\u2019d rather let herself fall freely than come back to him. </p><p>She had all the right to be hateful, but she didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t in her nature to cut people off and it came with its pros and cons. The good thing is, he could still walk up to her and have a conversation. The bad thing was that it probably wouldn\u2019t be very pleasant for both of them. Y/N would probably fight through wanting to punch his stupid face while Harry scoured his mind for something interesting to say. </p><p>Y/N deserved so much love\u2013<i>love</i> that he didn\u2019t give her before because he was blinded by what he thought was love for Daniela. He thought that Y/N and he were a dead end and he flew before he could get hurt; not taking into account that he was hurting instead. <i>He was a selfish man,</i> he concurs. But he\u2019s changed, he could feel something different spiking through within him. He was more prepared this time, more knowledgeable and Harry promised himself that he wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice. </p><p>He had a plethora building up within him\u2013<i>for Y/N</i>\u2013 but he wasn\u2019t allowed to give it to her no matter how much he wanted to. She won\u2019t accept. Frankly, he doesn\u2019t blame her. What he did was cruel\u2013<i>too cruel</i>. In fact, he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll find a way to get back on his feet if Y/N did something similar to him; much less doing it on his own like Y/N was at the moment. He betrayed and abandoned her for her <i>own</i> sister. That\u2019s twofold the pain that one would go through a cheating partner.</p><p>Speaking of, he hasn\u2019t actually <i>talked</i> to her since, well, since they \u2018<i>broke up</i>.\u2019 If he felt bad before everything spilled, his feeling exacerbated when he saw her looking thinly and like she didn\u2019t get enough sleep. There was no use trying to conjure up reasons as to <i>why</i> her appearance changed because Harry knew deep inside that he was the reason why she wasn\u2019t taking care of herself. </p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>While Harry was mourning over a loss of great love, Y/N was being lifted off of her sorrows by the one and only Niall. Despite knowing each other for only a few weeks\u2013close to a month\u2013 Y/N somehow found it in herself to let Niall in through her high walls and thick skin. She let him see that parts of her that she was afraid of because she felt like she could trust him. And so far, he made no action to disprove her conclusion. He was different, but she was still wary. </p><p>Niall and Y/N were getting close and closer each day. They started hanging out outside of class time. They started talking about other topics and not only about the project they\u2019d been assigned. Niall saw more of Y/N coming out of her shell, and she watched as the usually bubbly boy became vulnerable in the confines of her apartment walls.</p><p>\u201c<i>Chocolate is better than vanilla!</i>\u201d Niall exclaimed at her, spoon digging inside his pudding cup. \u201c<i>Change my mind,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N made a muffled sound with closed lips. Her mouth is filled by vanilla pudding. She shook her head in disagreement,<b><i> \u201cNuh uh,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah huh,\u201d</i> He responded as he outstretched his hand out to hers, indirectly asking for her pudding cup so that he could throw it in the bin. She was almost done with it. </p><p><b><i>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Chocolate pudding is kind of bitter,\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cBut vanilla pudding is too sweet!\u201d </i>He grabbed her cup, heading to the attached kitchen to rinse out the remains before tossing it in the recycling bin. </p><p>As Y/N watched him being so domestic\u2013being so caring for her\u2013 she realized that this was exactly how Harry acted in the early stage of their relationship. It seemed that she kept comparing Niall and Harry\u2019s actions, and she would always make herself sadder by the thought. Whatever Niall did, Harry would find a way to disclose the happy moment by reminding Y/N of what used to be and made her cautious of what could happen <i>again</i> if she let Niall come too close.</p><p>Y/N mumbled to herself quietly, trying to shut off the thoughts about how Niall will only hurt her. </p><p><i>\u201cWhat was that, Y/N?\u201d</i> He asked, plopping his bum down on the couch beside her. </p><p><b><i>\u201cI think you should leave</i></b>,\u201d She said so softly that Niall only got whisps of her sentence. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hmm? You wanna watch something else?</i>\u201d He grabbed the remote from the table in front of them. \u201c<i>I know you like rom-coms so maybe we\u2019ll watch that,\u201d</i></p><p>The TV flicked to the main menu. He browsed through the categories, briefly glancing at her. \u201c<i>Oi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI think you should leave,\u201d</i></b> Y/N said more sternly. Guilt was eating up her inside. Somehow, it felt wrong to have Niall over while she was still thinking of her ex-boyfriend. It wasn\u2019t fair to him either.</p><p>Her statement made him drop the remote on his lap. He winced a little but his eyes widened in surprise. His mouth opened and close, not knowing what to say when someone asks you to leave. \u201c<i>Oh, d-did I do something wrong?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head \u2018<i>no</i>\u2019. \u201c<b><i>I just\u2014 I have stuff to do and I won\u2019t be able to focus,\u201d</i></b></p><p>Niall nodded understandingly, but he was still discombobulated by the sudden request to exit the building. He stood up, grabbing his phone on the table before wrapping his arms in his coat that he had hung by the door. His hand grasped the doorknob, looking at her for a final time before he left. \u201c<i>Y/N,\u201d</i></p><p>She looked up to him from her position on the couch, the tears she\u2019d tried to dry out spilling a little over her waterline, \u201c<i>Yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Niall was worried for Y/N. Since the day she had asked him to leave, he hasn\u2019t seen much of her on campus. It was like she was avoiding him. Actually, he was certain that she <i>was</i> avoiding him because she recently switched seats to the other side of the room. She wouldn\u2019t even look on his direction, much less spare him a subtle wave or glance. He tried calling out her name one day after class, but he got no response from her. He could only watch as her head of hair disappeared among the mass crowd that hid her from him. </p><p>Y/N was disappointed in herself. She was aware of what she was doing this time. She was isolating herself and her pride wouldn\u2019t let her overcome the loop she\u2019d put herself in. Niall was getting closer to her faster than she had anticipated and it sent her into a frenzy. <i>Was she ready?</i> She didn\u2019t know if she was prepared to let somebody in again\u2013even though Niall had squeezed himself in\u2013she was scared.</p><p>She was shaking in her boots, teeth nipping on her fingernails as her eyes shifted from one corner of the room to the other because her mind couldn\u2019t stay quiet in the late hours of the night. Y/N was under the covers, hiding from the harsh reality of the world. <i>Would it be so wrong to let Niall in?</i> She so badly wanted to but there was a pull in her heart that warned her. She didn\u2019t know if she was being paranoid or there was something suspicious about Niall. </p><p>Nonetheless, Niall was very persistent in being in her life. He reached out to her in any way he knew how.; chased her after class, but she ignored it. He left voice messages on her phone when she failed to answer his calls. He spammed her with texts despite always being left on read. He was trying so hard and she was rejecting him with the same energy\u2013pushing him away, yet he pushed back and with it, he polished off the ball that is Y/N\u2019s fear of abandonment, making it more real than she thought possible.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cHey H</i>,\u201d Niall greeted as Harry opened the door to his apartment. He was over for the day to hang out and chill. The two boys haven\u2019t done so in a while, especially with exams and assignments running at full speed. </p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man?</i>\u201d Harry responded, leaning in for a hug.</p><p>Niall walked into the small living room\u2013as Harry had instructed\u2013while he gathered up some snacks and drinks to keep them filled while they caught up with each others\u2019 lives. Minutes later, Harry and his bowl filled arms came into view. </p><p>\u201c<i>How\u2019s you and Dani?</i>\u201d Niall questioned. He remembered how Y/N\u2019s face looked when they talked about the topic before, and he was antsy to confirm the truth. </p><p><i>\u201cWe broke up,</i>\u201d It was a solemn confession from him, but Harry was relieved.</p><p><i> \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>We just\u2013 we didn\u2019t work out</i>,\u201d Harry stuttered out an excuse. \u201c<i>How about you? Found anybody you like?\u201d</i></p><p>Niall cleared his throat, blinking rapidly as he was caught off guard of how quickly the question was directed to him. \u201c<i>Uh, yeah actually. Got my eye on someone,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cInnit?</i>\u201d Harry punched Niall\u2019s knee in a teasing manner, \u201c<i>What\u2019s her name? Do I know her?\u201d</i> He took a gulp from canned ice tea, filling his cheeks with the slightly chilled beverage. </p><p>\u201c<i>Her name\u2019s Y/N,</i>\u201d Niall watched carefully as Harry\u2019s eyes widened, fighting himself from spilling the liquid out of his mouth. <i>\u201cNot sure if it\u2019s *your Y/N, though,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry asked him what <i>that</i> Y/N looked like and from the way Niall as eyeing him cautiously, he knew that both of them were tiptoeing on a topic that was bound to make them face the truth. And when Niall described Y/N\u2019s appearance first, Harry couldn\u2019t help but envision a perfect image of her in his mind\u2014having not forgotten such a beautiful face. However, once Niall rambled in about her <i>\u2018perfect personality</i>\u2019; how she was nice and sweet, but humble and gentle\u2014Harry felt his heart hurting because that totally sounded like <i>his </i>Y/N.</p><p><i>\u201cDoes that sound like your Y/N?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry nodded, unable to deny something that was so undeniably true. It was quiet for minutes, neither of them saying a word to each other.</p><p>\u201c<i>Harry</i>,\u201d Niall began. <i>\u201cWere you\u2014did you leave Y/N for her sister?\u201d</i></p><p>He nodded hesitantly but nonetheless witnessed as hope vanished from Niall\u2019s baby blue eyes. He was praying that Harry wouldn\u2019t do such a thing, but he was proven wrong. \u201c<i>I did, yeah, I-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 not very nice,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that already?\u201d</i> Harry gassed, squinting his eyes. His nostrils were flaring from hearing the way Niall talked to him as if he didn\u2019t know that what he did was terrible. </p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t get angry at me! I\u2019m just saying</i>,\u201d Niall raised his hands up in the air. <i>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucked up man,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>I thought we were drifting. I had to get out before it got worse,</i>\u201d He gulped, trying to explain himself. \u201c<i>I didn\u2019t think I was gonna fall for Dani,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should\u2019ve talked to Y/N first?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Yes but sh-she,</i>\u201d Harry stuttered over his words. The simplest thing he could\u2019ve done to avoid this whole mess was to <i>talk</i> to Y/N, but it somehow managed to slip his mind. If he communicated with her, maybe they would\u2019ve fixed this and gone over the bump. <i>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m going to talk\u2014,\u201d</i></p><p>Niall phone buzzed loudly on the glass surface of the coffee table. He reached out to grab the device. \u201c<i>It\u2019s Y/N, I have to go,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry watched as Niall got up on his feet, waiting for him to do the same so he could bid him goodbye properly. The blonde patted the others\u2019 shoulder firmly as if to reprimand him of his wrongdoing. </p><p><i>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d </i></p><p>Niall looked over his shoulder, shrugging on his coat by the door. \u201c<i>Her place,\u201d </i></p><p>It was all Niall said before he unlocked the door and swung it open. Harry was left with his wandering thoughts that imagined filthy things going on between Y/N and his friend. He shook his head to get rid of them. </p><p>He sat on his love seat chair, legs spread widely as he covers his face with the expanse of his palm. He glanced up towards the ceiling, silently praying to a God that would be able to help him figure hot to cure the ache in his heart know that Y/N was progressing from him and slowly replacing him. He had no right to be angry but he couldn\u2019t help but want to burst into her place and blame her for moving on too fast; for not even trying to fix them before she let the fire between them simmer. But Harry knew that she was doing the best thing that she can for herself, and as much as he didn\u2019t want her to\u2014he was a selfish man and Harry wanted Y/N all to himself. </p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p><b><i>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done!</i></b>\u201d Y/N exclaimed excitedly from across Niall. They were in her bedroom, sat on her bed with papers surrounding both of them. Her laptop jostled over from her lap when she bounced from the knowledge that their efforts would soon dwindle when they finish this assignment. </p><p><i>\u201cOi, calm down Y/N. I have to focus,</i>\u201d Niall replied as he but his lip. Fingers typing on the keyboard to finish the last bits of information needed on the \u2018<i>reference</i>\u2019 page. </p><p>Y/N pouted at being reprimanded but she let her eyes dance on her own laptop screen as the pink line moved on the Google Doc that they were sharing. \u201c<i><b>Sorry, I\u2019m excited to relax,\u201d</b></i></p><p>It was true. Since Niall arrived, they\u2019ve hit it straight to the ballpark. They\u2019ve not had a break since hours ago and her stomach was rumbling with need. </p><p><i>\u201cAnd done!</i>\u201d Niall accentuated his words with a final tap to his keyboard\u2014submitting an assignment had never felt better than it did right at this moment. </p><p>Y/N gathered the papers in a neat pile before placing them in a blue folder. Niall shut down his computer, preparing to pack for his departure for the night. <i><b>\u201cWhere are you going, Ni?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He paused, halfway to zipping his bag when she asked him that. \u201c<i>Uh, my place?</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBut it\u2019s</b>,</i>\u201d Y/N glanced at her alarm clock. <i>\u201c<b>Eleven-thirty in the evening!\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u201c<i>So</i>?\u201d Niall raises his brows in confusion.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSo? You can\u2019t go out that late,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThen where am I supposed to sleep tonight,</i>\u201d He replied. Y/N thought the idea over her head and concluded that it wouldn\u2019t be too big of a deal to let Niall stay the night. </p><p><b><i>\u201cHere, of course,\u201d </i></b>She places her school materials on her desk, clearing her bed of any clutter. </p><p><i>\u201cYou want me,\u201d</i> He pointed at his chest. \u201c<i>To sleep here tonight?</i>\u201d Y/N nodded enthusiastically. </p><p>Y/N squealed as Niall landed on the spot beside her, body flopping against the mattress. He released a slight groan, \u201c<i>Ooo, your bed is comfy,\u201d </i></p><p>She giggled when he spread out his limbs purposely, shoving her off the bed eventually. \u201c<b><i>What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201c\u2018M a big guy, I need all the space I can get,\u201d</i> Y/N puffed air out from her tightly closed lips, mocking his words. </p><p><i><b>\u201cYou\u2019re not that big,\u201d </b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSize doesn\u2019t matter,</i>\u201d He mumbled the best he could with his cheek being squished against the soft pillows. </p><p>Y/N slapped his shoulder for his innuendo, instructing him to get up so that they could head to the kitchen and fix themselves some very late dinner. </p><p>Niall watched from his spot on her kitchen table as Y/N seemed to dance around from spot to spot, collecting ingredients and mixing them in the pot on the stove. His mouth watering with the delicious aroma wafting the air around him despite the exhaust fan above being turned on. </p><p><i>\u201cY/N, I have a question,\u201d</i> She hummed in response. \u201c<i>Did Harry leave you for Dani?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N paused her movements, arm stuck frozen from its stirring position. He couldn\u2019t see her face and she was glad because she was sure that it must\u2019ve morphed into a crumpled expression. </p><p><i>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t have to answer that,</i>\u201d Niall cleared his throat. \u201c<i>He was a jerk to do that. Harry, I mean,\u201d</i></p><p>He continued when Y/N didn\u2019t respond verbally. \u201c<i>I apologize for him. He\u2019s my friend and I\u2019m having a hard time comprehending that he could do something so vile,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I want you to know that he doesn\u2019t deserve you,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N felt the warmth of his body against the expanse her back and she was rendered frozen once again. <b><i>\u201cI know,\u201d </i></b></p><p>She could hear him chuckle breathily and for a moment, she smiled too.<i> \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get over him, you know,</b></i>\u201d She sighed, finally turning around, only to be met with his broad chest. She stared at the white shirt that covered his skin, thinking through her next words. <i><b>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cBut being with you,\u201d</i></b> Y/N lifted a hand up to his chest, letting a finger trace lightly. Niall\u2019s heart quickened its pace, she could tell from the increasingly deeper breaths he took. She swore she could feel his heartbeat pounding through the barriers. </p><p>His hands touched her lower back gently just after he switched the stove knob off. He was afraid to take her by surprise when he felt her body tense, but it soon relaxed against his touch. Niall was looking at the top of her head because of his height advantage, and he so badly wanted to tilt her chin up and bore his eyes into her pretty ones. </p><p><i><b>\u201cBut with you, it gets easier.\u201d </b></i></p><p>And maybe it was stupid of Harry to impulsively visit Y/N at the slither of dusk, and even stupider when he put his key\u2013that he never gave back to her\u2013in the keyhole because she wasn\u2019t answering the door. His mind was fuzzy and he wasn\u2019t thinking clearly; maybe his knocks were too light against the wood of the door. He thought Y/N was ignoring him because he can clearly see a crack of light from underneath in front of his feet. It was the stupidest thing to enter her apartment, ready to softly call out her name. He can smell the food she\u2019d always especially make for him\u2014it wasn\u2019t just his mouth-watering, but his eyes as well because the root of the intoxicating scent was centered on the stove. He couldn\u2019t see the appliance because of two bodies blocking the way.\u00a0</p><p>He really wished that he\u2019d just waited behind the closed door and not witness the sight in front of him.</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>okay so I said I was recurringly posting part 4 with pt3 but im late sO O WELL.

Harry had left shortly after dinner, indicating that he should probably look for Dani. It was an eventful two days, to say the least, but Y/N felt a little better sharing some of her internal hardships to people that will comfort and support her.</p><p>She was on her way to class when the sighting of a familiar man made her slow her pace down in order to watch his interaction with Dani. Niall and her sister were talking to each other animatedly, and she would\u2019ve loved to stay and watch but she really had to get going. <i>He should too,</i> Y/N thought, since they were in the same class after all.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Y/N. How was your weekend?</i>\u201d Niall greeted her cheerily, taking a seat on the chair beside her. She looked at him for a few seconds, debating if she had the right to ask what she wanted to question.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Why were you talking to Daniela?\u201d </b>Sh</i>e interrogated, hands playing with each other as a nervous habit.</p><p>\u201c<i>Ah, thought I saw you walk past, didn\u2019t even say hi to me,\u201d </i>Niall bore a grin towards her, avoiding the extent of her question. </p><p>Y/N knew that Harry felt more comfortable keeping their relationships to themselves, not because he was embarrassed by her; but because he wanted to make sure that the person that he was with currently would be there for a long time. He explained to her some time ago and she understood since she was also quite iffy of Harry meeting her sister. So, she really didn\u2019t know many of Harry\u2019s friends, not aware that Niall was one of them. </p><p>\u201c<i><b>Sorry, had to get to class</b></i>,\u201d She shrugged her shoulders, pulling out a pen and notebook. \u201c<b><i>Are you gonna answer me?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cWoah, slow down tiger,</i>\u201d Niall widened his eyes at her intrusive question. \u201c<i>Well, just came to talk to her cause there\u2019s been some rumors going around,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N turned her shoulders to face him, interested in what he had to say and if she could do anything to help her sister out\u2013 after all, they were still relatives. \u201c<i>What kind of rumors?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Heard she stole her own sister\u2019 boyfriend,</i>\u201d Niall whispered, looking around as if he didn\u2019t want anybody else to know. \u201c<i>What a bitch! And that boyfriend\u2019s a fucking asshole,\u201d</i></p><p>She was alert, back extended to her full height as she let the next words fall out of her mouth, \u201c<b><i>Do you know t-their names?\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>Hmm well, I think her sister\u2019s name is Y/N? Not you though,</i>\u201d He tilted his chin to gesture at her. \u201c<i>And I dunno the boyfriend, but she\u2019s dating a new guy now,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOh really?</i></b>\u201d \u201c<i>Yeah, he\u2019s my best mate,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYour best mate?</i></b>\u201d Y/N stuttered out, feeling her heart start to pound. From the corner of her eye, she could see the professor walk down the angled slope towards the front of the lecture hall. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah. Harry Styles? Do you know him?\u201d</i> Niall asked, completely oblivious. \u201c<i>He was a dating a Y/N too,\u201d</i></p><p>She only gulped at him, \u201c<i>Funny, isn\u2019t it?</i>\u201d He continued, trailing off when the puzzle pieces fit with each other, <i>\u201cWait, d-did you\u2013 are you..?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N blinked, facing the front. She could feel Niall\u2019s blue eyes lingering on the side of her face, watching her with caution and what she\u2019s been used to recently\u2013<i>empathy</i>. But, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Harry was over at Dani\u2019s apartment for the day. It was the first time that they\u2019ve met up since the disastrous dinner at her parents\u2019 house. Harry ducked down from the flying shoe that speedily whizzed past his head.</p><p>\u201c<i>That\u2019s funny, I thought boyfriends were supposed to support their girlfriend!</i>\u201d Dan\u2019s voice bellowed from the distance where she threw the shoe. </p><p>For the time that he was alone, Harry had confirmed to himself that he did\u2013indeed\u2013 \u00a0still loves Y/N. He figured the feelings were pulling at his heart, but his talk with Carlos further exemplified the things he was feeling. Not only that, but the newfound knowledge about Dani\u2019s evil-doings had kicked him in the gut. </p><p><i>\u201cNot when you hurt people, Dani\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Now you care about Y/N?</i>\u201d She scoffed, rolling her eyes at him and Harry swore that that was all she did nowadays. </p><p><i>\u201cI always cared for her,\u201d </i></p><p>\u201c<i>Even when you fucked me in your bed while you were still together?</i>\u201d A ringing appeared near Harry\u2019s ears as if it was information that was hard to swallow. \u201c<i>You\u2019re lying to yourself,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou manipulated me,\u201d</i> Harry said, running a hand through his hair. <i>\u201cYou used me to hurt her and I let you,\u201d</i></p><p>Dani responded, \u201c<i>So what if I did? All my life the attention has been on her. Everybody prefers her and I can\u2019t stand it so I did what I had to do to make her feel like she deserves</i>,\u201d She crossed her arms across her chest, <i>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you left her,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201d<i>You\u2019re so jealous of her that you\u2019ve gone insane,</i>\u201d Harry twirled his finger against his temple, striding his long leg towards Dani, \u201c<i>We\u2019re over.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAm I supposed to be hurt by that?\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you truly loved me, it should.</i>\u201d It was a loose thread that Harry was pulling at. Through the short months of being with Dani, he couldn\u2019t help but develop fundamental feelings for her\u2013he was only human after all, and being in a relationship can boggle with his mind. </p><p>\u201c<i>But I didn\u2019t</i>,\u201d And Harry really shouldn\u2019t have cared by that statement because he expected it. However, his desire to find a mate kicks in and he is met with the realization that he had neither a partner or a sentimental value of love. It\u2019s not like Y/N would take him back either. </p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like I just kicked a puppy,</i>\u201d Dani interrupts his train of thought. \u201c<i>You\u2019ll get over it quickly,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry was gobsmacked with the intensity of it all. He just found out that his own girlfriend lied to him about her childhood, and he realized his feelings for Y/N but now, he can\u2019t even do anything about it. What are the chances of her letting him talk to her, let alone <i>be</i> in the <i>same</i> room as her?</p><p>Daniela was a\u2013very\u2013cold woman to be able to do the thing she did. She could\u2019ve simply talked Y/N about how she felt; Harry was sure that Y/N would\u2019ve listened to her worries. But no, she was a bulldozer that attacked the moment she got the chance and Y/N was blinded by the idea of blood being thicker than water that she let herself get trampled by her own sister. </p><p>As for Harry, he found himself in a mindset the picked on everything he did wrong. Y/N was such a strong woman for handling things the way she did. When she answered the door for them, she greeted them in a civilized way\u2013with a smile even. And when Dani insulted her right in front of their family, Y/N was dignified and didn\u2019t let it bother her but before she went upstairs again, Harry could see the pain in her eyes. She was crumbling and he could clearly identify that she was screaming for help; but not from him. Even if he was the last man on earth, and she was drowning; she\u2019d rather let herself fall freely than come back to him. </p><p>She had all the right to be hateful, but she didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t in her nature to cut people off and it came with its pros and cons. The good thing is, he could still walk up to her and have a conversation. The bad thing was that it probably wouldn\u2019t be very pleasant for both of them. Y/N would probably fight through wanting to punch his stupid face while Harry scoured his mind for something interesting to say. </p><p>Y/N deserved so much love\u2013<i>love</i> that he didn\u2019t give her before because he was blinded by what he thought was love for Daniela. He thought that Y/N and he were a dead end and he flew before he could get hurt; not taking into account that he was hurting instead. <i>He was a selfish man,</i> he concurs. But he\u2019s changed, he could feel something different spiking through within him. He was more prepared this time, more knowledgeable and Harry promised himself that he wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice. </p><p>He had a plethora building up within him\u2013<i>for Y/N</i>\u2013 but he wasn\u2019t allowed to give it to her no matter how much he wanted to. She won\u2019t accept. Frankly, he doesn\u2019t blame her. What he did was cruel\u2013<i>too cruel</i>. In fact, he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll find a way to get back on his feet if Y/N did something similar to him; much less doing it on his own like Y/N was at the moment. He betrayed and abandoned her for her <i>own</i> sister. That\u2019s twofold the pain that one would go through a cheating partner.</p><p>Speaking of, he hasn\u2019t actually <i>talked</i> to her since, well, since they \u2018<i>broke up</i>.\u2019 If he felt bad before everything spilled, his feeling exacerbated when he saw her looking thinly and like she didn\u2019t get enough sleep. There was no use trying to conjure up reasons as to <i>why</i> her appearance changed because Harry knew deep inside that he was the reason why she wasn\u2019t taking care of herself. </p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>While Harry was mourning over a loss of great love, Y/N was being lifted off of her sorrows by the one and only Niall. Despite knowing each other for only a few weeks\u2013close to a month\u2013 Y/N somehow found it in herself to let Niall in through her high walls and thick skin. She let him see that parts of her that she was afraid of because she felt like she could trust him. And so far, he made no action to disprove her conclusion. He was different, but she was still wary. </p><p>Niall and Y/N were getting close and closer each day. They started hanging out outside of class time. They started talking about other topics and not only about the project they\u2019d been assigned. Niall saw more of Y/N coming out of her shell, and she watched as the usually bubbly boy became vulnerable in the confines of her apartment walls.</p><p>\u201c<i>Chocolate is better than vanilla!</i>\u201d Niall exclaimed at her, spoon digging inside his pudding cup. \u201c<i>Change my mind,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N made a muffled sound with closed lips. Her mouth is filled by vanilla pudding. She shook her head in disagreement,<b><i> \u201cNuh uh,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah huh,\u201d</i> He responded as he outstretched his hand out to hers, indirectly asking for her pudding cup so that he could throw it in the bin. She was almost done with it. </p><p><b><i>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Chocolate pudding is kind of bitter,\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cBut vanilla pudding is too sweet!\u201d </i>He grabbed her cup, heading to the attached kitchen to rinse out the remains before tossing it in the recycling bin. </p><p>As Y/N watched him being so domestic\u2013being so caring for her\u2013 she realized that this was exactly how Harry acted in the early stage of their relationship. It seemed that she kept comparing Niall and Harry\u2019s actions, and she would always make herself sadder by the thought. Whatever Niall did, Harry would find a way to disclose the happy moment by reminding Y/N of what used to be and made her cautious of what could happen <i>again</i> if she let Niall come too close.</p><p>Y/N mumbled to herself quietly, trying to shut off the thoughts about how Niall will only hurt her. </p><p><i>\u201cWhat was that, Y/N?\u201d</i> He asked, plopping his bum down on the couch beside her. </p><p><b><i>\u201cI think you should leave</i></b>,\u201d She said so softly that Niall only got whisps of her sentence. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hmm? You wanna watch something else?</i>\u201d He grabbed the remote from the table in front of them. \u201c<i>I know you like rom-coms so maybe we\u2019ll watch that,\u201d</i></p><p>The TV flicked to the main menu. He browsed through the categories, briefly glancing at her. \u201c<i>Oi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI think you should leave,\u201d</i></b> Y/N said more sternly. Guilt was eating up her inside. Somehow, it felt wrong to have Niall over while she was still thinking of her ex-boyfriend. It wasn\u2019t fair to him either.</p><p>Her statement made him drop the remote on his lap. He winced a little but his eyes widened in surprise. His mouth opened and close, not knowing what to say when someone asks you to leave. \u201c<i>Oh, d-did I do something wrong?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head \u2018<i>no</i>\u2019. \u201c<b><i>I just\u2014 I have stuff to do and I won\u2019t be able to focus,\u201d</i></b></p><p>Niall nodded understandingly, but he was still discombobulated by the sudden request to exit the building. He stood up, grabbing his phone on the table before wrapping his arms in his coat that he had hung by the door. His hand grasped the doorknob, looking at her for a final time before he left. \u201c<i>Y/N,\u201d</i></p><p>She looked up to him from her position on the couch, the tears she\u2019d tried to dry out spilling a little over her waterline, \u201c<i>Yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Niall was worried for Y/N. Since the day she had asked him to leave, he hasn\u2019t seen much of her on campus. It was like she was avoiding him. Actually, he was certain that she <i>was</i> avoiding him because she recently switched seats to the other side of the room. She wouldn\u2019t even look on his direction, much less spare him a subtle wave or glance. He tried calling out her name one day after class, but he got no response from her. He could only watch as her head of hair disappeared among the mass crowd that hid her from him. </p><p>Y/N was disappointed in herself. She was aware of what she was doing this time. She was isolating herself and her pride wouldn\u2019t let her overcome the loop she\u2019d put herself in. Niall was getting closer to her faster than she had anticipated and it sent her into a frenzy. <i>Was she ready?</i> She didn\u2019t know if she was prepared to let somebody in again\u2013even though Niall had squeezed himself in\u2013she was scared.</p><p>She was shaking in her boots, teeth nipping on her fingernails as her eyes shifted from one corner of the room to the other because her mind couldn\u2019t stay quiet in the late hours of the night. Y/N was under the covers, hiding from the harsh reality of the world. <i>Would it be so wrong to let Niall in?</i> She so badly wanted to but there was a pull in her heart that warned her. She didn\u2019t know if she was being paranoid or there was something suspicious about Niall. </p><p>Nonetheless, Niall was very persistent in being in her life. He reached out to her in any way he knew how.; chased her after class, but she ignored it. He left voice messages on her phone when she failed to answer his calls. He spammed her with texts despite always being left on read. He was trying so hard and she was rejecting him with the same energy\u2013pushing him away, yet he pushed back and with it, he polished off the ball that is Y/N\u2019s fear of abandonment, making it more real than she thought possible.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cHey H</i>,\u201d Niall greeted as Harry opened the door to his apartment. He was over for the day to hang out and chill. The two boys haven\u2019t done so in a while, especially with exams and assignments running at full speed. </p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man?</i>\u201d Harry responded, leaning in for a hug.</p><p>Niall walked into the small living room\u2013as Harry had instructed\u2013while he gathered up some snacks and drinks to keep them filled while they caught up with each others\u2019 lives. Minutes later, Harry and his bowl filled arms came into view. </p><p>\u201c<i>How\u2019s you and Dani?</i>\u201d Niall questioned. He remembered how Y/N\u2019s face looked when they talked about the topic before, and he was antsy to confirm the truth. </p><p><i>\u201cWe broke up,</i>\u201d It was a solemn confession from him, but Harry was relieved.</p><p><i> \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>We just\u2013 we didn\u2019t work out</i>,\u201d Harry stuttered out an excuse. \u201c<i>How about you? Found anybody you like?\u201d</i></p><p>Niall cleared his throat, blinking rapidly as he was caught off guard of how quickly the question was directed to him. \u201c<i>Uh, yeah actually. Got my eye on someone,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cInnit?</i>\u201d Harry punched Niall\u2019s knee in a teasing manner, \u201c<i>What\u2019s her name? Do I know her?\u201d</i> He took a gulp from canned ice tea, filling his cheeks with the slightly chilled beverage. </p><p>\u201c<i>Her name\u2019s Y/N,</i>\u201d Niall watched carefully as Harry\u2019s eyes widened, fighting himself from spilling the liquid out of his mouth. <i>\u201cNot sure if it\u2019s *your Y/N, though,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry asked him what <i>that</i> Y/N looked like and from the way Niall as eyeing him cautiously, he knew that both of them were tiptoeing on a topic that was bound to make them face the truth. And when Niall described Y/N\u2019s appearance first, Harry couldn\u2019t help but envision a perfect image of her in his mind\u2014having not forgotten such a beautiful face. However, once Niall rambled in about her <i>\u2018perfect personality</i>\u2019; how she was nice and sweet, but humble and gentle\u2014Harry felt his heart hurting because that totally sounded like <i>his </i>Y/N.</p><p><i>\u201cDoes that sound like your Y/N?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry nodded, unable to deny something that was so undeniably true. It was quiet for minutes, neither of them saying a word to each other.</p><p>\u201c<i>Harry</i>,\u201d Niall began. <i>\u201cWere you\u2014did you leave Y/N for her sister?\u201d</i></p><p>He nodded hesitantly but nonetheless witnessed as hope vanished from Niall\u2019s baby blue eyes. He was praying that Harry wouldn\u2019t do such a thing, but he was proven wrong. \u201c<i>I did, yeah, I-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 not very nice,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that already?\u201d</i> Harry gassed, squinting his eyes. His nostrils were flaring from hearing the way Niall talked to him as if he didn\u2019t know that what he did was terrible. </p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t get angry at me! I\u2019m just saying</i>,\u201d Niall raised his hands up in the air. <i>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucked up man,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>I thought we were drifting. I had to get out before it got worse,</i>\u201d He gulped, trying to explain himself. \u201c<i>I didn\u2019t think I was gonna fall for Dani,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should\u2019ve talked to Y/N first?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Yes but sh-she,</i>\u201d Harry stuttered over his words. The simplest thing he could\u2019ve done to avoid this whole mess was to <i>talk</i> to Y/N, but it somehow managed to slip his mind. If he communicated with her, maybe they would\u2019ve fixed this and gone over the bump. <i>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m going to talk\u2014,\u201d</i></p><p>Niall phone buzzed loudly on the glass surface of the coffee table. He reached out to grab the device. \u201c<i>It\u2019s Y/N, I have to go,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry watched as Niall got up on his feet, waiting for him to do the same so he could bid him goodbye properly. The blonde patted the others\u2019 shoulder firmly as if to reprimand him of his wrongdoing. </p><p><i>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d </i></p><p>Niall looked over his shoulder, shrugging on his coat by the door. \u201c<i>Her place,\u201d </i></p><p>It was all Niall said before he unlocked the door and swung it open. Harry was left with his wandering thoughts that imagined filthy things going on between Y/N and his friend. He shook his head to get rid of them. </p><p>He sat on his love seat chair, legs spread widely as he covers his face with the expanse of his palm. He glanced up towards the ceiling, silently praying to a God that would be able to help him figure hot to cure the ache in his heart know that Y/N was progressing from him and slowly replacing him. He had no right to be angry but he couldn\u2019t help but want to burst into her place and blame her for moving on too fast; for not even trying to fix them before she let the fire between them simmer. But Harry knew that she was doing the best thing that she can for herself, and as much as he didn\u2019t want her to\u2014he was a selfish man and Harry wanted Y/N all to himself. </p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p><b><i>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done!</i></b>\u201d Y/N exclaimed excitedly from across Niall. They were in her bedroom, sat on her bed with papers surrounding both of them. Her laptop jostled over from her lap when she bounced from the knowledge that their efforts would soon dwindle when they finish this assignment. </p><p><i>\u201cOi, calm down Y/N. I have to focus,</i>\u201d Niall replied as he but his lip. Fingers typing on the keyboard to finish the last bits of information needed on the \u2018<i>reference</i>\u2019 page. </p><p>Y/N pouted at being reprimanded but she let her eyes dance on her own laptop screen as the pink line moved on the Google Doc that they were sharing. \u201c<i><b>Sorry, I\u2019m excited to relax,\u201d</b></i></p><p>It was true. Since Niall arrived, they\u2019ve hit it straight to the ballpark. They\u2019ve not had a break since hours ago and her stomach was rumbling with need. </p><p><i>\u201cAnd done!</i>\u201d Niall accentuated his words with a final tap to his keyboard\u2014submitting an assignment had never felt better than it did right at this moment. </p><p>Y/N gathered the papers in a neat pile before placing them in a blue folder. Niall shut down his computer, preparing to pack for his departure for the night. <i><b>\u201cWhere are you going, Ni?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He paused, halfway to zipping his bag when she asked him that. \u201c<i>Uh, my place?</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBut it\u2019s</b>,</i>\u201d Y/N glanced at her alarm clock. <i>\u201c<b>Eleven-thirty in the evening!\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u201c<i>So</i>?\u201d Niall raises his brows in confusion.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSo? You can\u2019t go out that late,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThen where am I supposed to sleep tonight,</i>\u201d He replied. Y/N thought the idea over her head and concluded that it wouldn\u2019t be too big of a deal to let Niall stay the night. </p><p><b><i>\u201cHere, of course,\u201d </i></b>She places her school materials on her desk, clearing her bed of any clutter. </p><p><i>\u201cYou want me,\u201d</i> He pointed at his chest. \u201c<i>To sleep here tonight?</i>\u201d Y/N nodded enthusiastically. </p><p>Y/N squealed as Niall landed on the spot beside her, body flopping against the mattress. He released a slight groan, \u201c<i>Ooo, your bed is comfy,\u201d </i></p><p>She giggled when he spread out his limbs purposely, shoving her off the bed eventually. \u201c<b><i>What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201c\u2018M a big guy, I need all the space I can get,\u201d</i> Y/N puffed air out from her tightly closed lips, mocking his words. </p><p><i><b>\u201cYou\u2019re not that big,\u201d </b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSize doesn\u2019t matter,</i>\u201d He mumbled the best he could with his cheek being squished against the soft pillows. </p><p>Y/N slapped his shoulder for his innuendo, instructing him to get up so that they could head to the kitchen and fix themselves some very late dinner. </p><p>Niall watched from his spot on her kitchen table as Y/N seemed to dance around from spot to spot, collecting ingredients and mixing them in the pot on the stove. His mouth watering with the delicious aroma wafting the air around him despite the exhaust fan above being turned on. </p><p><i>\u201cY/N, I have a question,\u201d</i> She hummed in response. \u201c<i>Did Harry leave you for Dani?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N paused her movements, arm stuck frozen from its stirring position. He couldn\u2019t see her face and she was glad because she was sure that it must\u2019ve morphed into a crumpled expression. </p><p><i>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t have to answer that,</i>\u201d Niall cleared his throat. \u201c<i>He was a jerk to do that. Harry, I mean,\u201d</i></p><p>He continued when Y/N didn\u2019t respond verbally. \u201c<i>I apologize for him. He\u2019s my friend and I\u2019m having a hard time comprehending that he could do something so vile,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I want you to know that he doesn\u2019t deserve you,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N felt the warmth of his body against the expanse her back and she was rendered frozen once again. <b><i>\u201cI know,\u201d </i></b></p><p>She could hear him chuckle breathily and for a moment, she smiled too.<i> \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get over him, you know,</b></i>\u201d She sighed, finally turning around, only to be met with his broad chest. She stared at the white shirt that covered his skin, thinking through her next words. <i><b>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cBut being with you,\u201d</i></b> Y/N lifted a hand up to his chest, letting a finger trace lightly. Niall\u2019s heart quickened its pace, she could tell from the increasingly deeper breaths he took. She swore she could feel his heartbeat pounding through the barriers. </p><p>His hands touched her lower back gently just after he switched the stove knob off. He was afraid to take her by surprise when he felt her body tense, but it soon relaxed against his touch. Niall was looking at the top of her head because of his height advantage, and he so badly wanted to tilt her chin up and bore his eyes into her pretty ones. </p><p><i><b>\u201cBut with you, it gets easier.\u201d </b></i></p><p>And maybe it was stupid of Harry to impulsively visit Y/N at the slither of dusk, and even stupider when he put his key\u2013that he never gave back to her\u2013in the keyhole because she wasn\u2019t answering the door. His mind was fuzzy and he wasn\u2019t thinking clearly; maybe his knocks were too light against the wood of the door. He thought Y/N was ignoring him because he can clearly see a crack of light from underneath in front of his feet. It was the stupidest thing to enter her apartment, ready to softly call out her name. He can smell the food she\u2019d always especially make for him\u2014it wasn\u2019t just his mouth-watering, but his eyes as well because the root of the intoxicating scent was centered on the stove. He couldn\u2019t see the appliance because of two bodies blocking the way.\u00a0</p><p>He really wished that he\u2019d just waited behind the closed door and not witness the sight in front of him.</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>okay so I said I was recurringly posting part 4 with pt3 but im late sO O WELL.

                "content": "<p><b><i>Summary: Harry falls out of love</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings: angst and a lil fluff&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b><i>Word Count: 4.4k</i></b></p><h2><b><i>[THIS IS UNEDITED]</i></b></h2><p>The weekend getaway was over&nbsp;and Y/N was back to reality. Harry had left shortly after dinner, indicating that he should probably look for Dani. It was an eventful two days, to say the least, but Y/N felt a little better sharing some of her internal hardships to people that will comfort and support her.</p><p>She was on her way to class when the sighting of a familiar man made her slow her pace down in order to watch his interaction with Dani. Niall and her sister were talking to each other animatedly, and she would&rsquo;ve loved to stay and watch but she really had to get going. <i>He should too,</i> Y/N thought, since they were in the same class after all.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, Y/N. How was your weekend?</i>&rdquo; Niall greeted her cheerily, taking a seat on the chair beside her. She looked at him for a few seconds, debating if she had the right to ask what she wanted to question.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Why were you talking to Daniela?&rdquo; </b>Sh</i>e interrogated, hands playing with each other as a nervous habit.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Ah, thought I saw you walk past, didn&rsquo;t even say hi to me,&rdquo; </i>Niall bore a grin towards her, avoiding the extent of her question. </p><p>Y/N knew that Harry felt more comfortable keeping their relationships to themselves, not because he was embarrassed by her; but because he wanted to make sure that the person that he was with currently would be there for a long time. He explained to her some time ago and she understood since she was also quite iffy of Harry meeting her sister. So, she really didn&rsquo;t know many of Harry&rsquo;s friends, not aware that Niall was one of them. </p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Sorry, had to get to class</b></i>,&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders, pulling out a pen and notebook. &ldquo;<b><i>Are you gonna answer me?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Woah, slow down tiger,</i>&rdquo; Niall widened his eyes at her intrusive question. &ldquo;<i>Well, just came to talk to her cause there&rsquo;s been some rumors going around,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N turned her shoulders to face him, interested in what he had to say and if she could do anything to help her sister out&ndash; after all, they were still relatives. &ldquo;<i>What kind of rumors?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Heard she stole her own sister&rsquo; boyfriend,</i>&rdquo; Niall whispered, looking around as if he didn&rsquo;t want anybody else to know. &ldquo;<i>What a bitch! And that boyfriend&rsquo;s a fucking asshole,&rdquo;</i></p><p>She was alert, back extended to her full height as she let the next words fall out of her mouth, &ldquo;<b><i>Do you know t-their names?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hmm well, I think her sister&rsquo;s name is Y/N? Not you though,</i>&rdquo; He tilted his chin to gesture at her. &ldquo;<i>And I dunno the boyfriend, but she&rsquo;s dating a new guy now,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Oh really?</i></b>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Yeah, he&rsquo;s my best mate,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Your best mate?</i></b>&rdquo; Y/N stuttered out, feeling her heart start to pound. From the corner of her eye, she could see the professor walk down the angled slope towards the front of the lecture hall. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yeah. Harry Styles? Do you know him?&rdquo;</i> Niall asked, completely oblivious. &ldquo;<i>He was a dating a Y/N too,&rdquo;</i></p><p>She only gulped at him, &ldquo;<i>Funny, isn&rsquo;t it?</i>&rdquo; He continued, trailing off when the puzzle pieces fit with each other, <i>&ldquo;Wait, d-did you&ndash; are you..?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N blinked, facing the front. She could feel Niall&rsquo;s blue eyes lingering on the side of her face, watching her with caution and what she&rsquo;s been used to recently&ndash;<i>empathy</i>. But, he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Harry was over at Dani&rsquo;s apartment for the day. It was the first time that they&rsquo;ve met up since the disastrous dinner at her parents&rsquo; house. Harry ducked down from the flying shoe that speedily whizzed past his head.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s funny, I thought boyfriends were supposed to support their girlfriend!</i>&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice bellowed from the distance where she threw the shoe. </p><p>For the time that he was alone, Harry had confirmed to himself that he did&ndash;indeed&ndash; &nbsp;still loves Y/N. He figured the feelings were pulling at his heart, but his talk with Carlos further exemplified the things he was feeling. Not only that, but the newfound knowledge about Dani&rsquo;s evil-doings had kicked him in the gut. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Not when you hurt people, Dani&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Now you care about Y/N?</i>&rdquo; She scoffed, rolling her eyes at him and Harry swore that that was all she did nowadays. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I always cared for her,&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Even when you fucked me in your bed while you were still together?</i>&rdquo; A ringing appeared near Harry&rsquo;s ears as if it was information that was hard to swallow. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re lying to yourself,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You manipulated me,&rdquo;</i> Harry said, running a hand through his hair. <i>&ldquo;You used me to hurt her and I let you,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Dani responded, &ldquo;<i>So what if I did? All my life the attention has been on her. Everybody prefers her and I can&rsquo;t stand it so I did what I had to do to make her feel like she deserves</i>,&rdquo; She crossed her arms across her chest, <i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault you left her,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&rdquo;<i>You&rsquo;re so jealous of her that you&rsquo;ve gone insane,</i>&rdquo; Harry twirled his finger against his temple, striding his long leg towards Dani, &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re over.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Am I supposed to be hurt by that?&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you truly loved me, it should.</i>&rdquo; It was a loose thread that Harry was pulling at. Through the short months of being with Dani, he couldn&rsquo;t help but develop fundamental feelings for her&ndash;he was only human after all, and being in a relationship can boggle with his mind. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>But I didn&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; And Harry really shouldn&rsquo;t have cared by that statement because he expected it. However, his desire to find a mate kicks in and he is met with the realization that he had neither a partner or a sentimental value of love. It&rsquo;s not like Y/N would take him back either. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like I just kicked a puppy,</i>&rdquo; Dani interrupts his train of thought. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll get over it quickly,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry was gobsmacked with the intensity of it all. He just found out that his own girlfriend lied to him about her childhood, and he realized his feelings for Y/N but now, he can&rsquo;t even do anything about it. What are the chances of her letting him talk to her, let alone <i>be</i> in the <i>same</i> room as her?</p><p>Daniela was a&ndash;very&ndash;cold woman to be able to do the thing she did. She could&rsquo;ve simply talked Y/N about how she felt; Harry was sure that Y/N would&rsquo;ve listened to her worries. But no, she was a bulldozer that attacked the moment she got the chance and Y/N was blinded by the idea of blood being thicker than water that she let herself get trampled by her own sister. </p><p>As for Harry, he found himself in a mindset the picked on everything he did wrong. Y/N was such a strong woman for handling things the way she did. When she answered the door for them, she greeted them in a civilized way&ndash;with a smile even. And when Dani insulted her right in front of their family, Y/N was dignified and didn&rsquo;t let it bother her but before she went upstairs again, Harry could see the pain in her eyes. She was crumbling and he could clearly identify that she was screaming for help; but not from him. Even if he was the last man on earth, and she was drowning; she&rsquo;d rather let herself fall freely than come back to him. </p><p>She had all the right to be hateful, but she didn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t in her nature to cut people off and it came with its pros and cons. The good thing is, he could still walk up to her and have a conversation. The bad thing was that it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be very pleasant for both of them. Y/N would probably fight through wanting to punch his stupid face while Harry scoured his mind for something interesting to say. </p><p>Y/N deserved so much love&ndash;<i>love</i> that he didn&rsquo;t give her before because he was blinded by what he thought was love for Daniela. He thought that Y/N and he were a dead end and he flew before he could get hurt; not taking into account that he was hurting instead. <i>He was a selfish man,</i> he concurs. But he&rsquo;s changed, he could feel something different spiking through within him. He was more prepared this time, more knowledgeable and Harry promised himself that he wouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistake twice. </p><p>He had a plethora building up within him&ndash;<i>for Y/N</i>&ndash; but he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to give it to her no matter how much he wanted to. She won&rsquo;t accept. Frankly, he doesn&rsquo;t blame her. What he did was cruel&ndash;<i>too cruel</i>. In fact, he doesn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;ll find a way to get back on his feet if Y/N did something similar to him; much less doing it on his own like Y/N was at the moment. He betrayed and abandoned her for her <i>own</i> sister. That&rsquo;s twofold the pain that one would go through a cheating partner.</p><p>Speaking of, he hasn&rsquo;t actually <i>talked</i> to her since, well, since they &lsquo;<i>broke up</i>.&rsquo; If he felt bad before everything spilled, his feeling exacerbated when he saw her looking thinly and like she didn&rsquo;t get enough sleep. There was no use trying to conjure up reasons as to <i>why</i> her appearance changed because Harry knew deep inside that he was the reason why she wasn&rsquo;t taking care of herself. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>While Harry was mourning over a loss of great love, Y/N was being lifted off of her sorrows by the one and only Niall. Despite knowing each other for only a few weeks&ndash;close to a month&ndash; Y/N somehow found it in herself to let Niall in through her high walls and thick skin. She let him see that parts of her that she was afraid of because she felt like she could trust him. And so far, he made no action to disprove her conclusion. He was different, but she was still wary. </p><p>Niall and Y/N were getting close and closer each day. They started hanging out outside of class time. They started talking about other topics and not only about the project they&rsquo;d been assigned. Niall saw more of Y/N coming out of her shell, and she watched as the usually bubbly boy became vulnerable in the confines of her apartment walls.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Chocolate is better than vanilla!</i>&rdquo; Niall exclaimed at her, spoon digging inside his pudding cup. &ldquo;<i>Change my mind,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N made a muffled sound with closed lips. Her mouth is filled by vanilla pudding. She shook her head in disagreement,<b><i> &ldquo;Nuh uh,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yeah huh,&rdquo;</i> He responded as he outstretched his hand out to hers, indirectly asking for her pudding cup so that he could throw it in the bin. She was almost done with it. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Chocolate pudding is kind of bitter,&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;But vanilla pudding is too sweet!&rdquo; </i>He grabbed her cup, heading to the attached kitchen to rinse out the remains before tossing it in the recycling bin. </p><p>As Y/N watched him being so domestic&ndash;being so caring for her&ndash; she realized that this was exactly how Harry acted in the early stage of their relationship. It seemed that she kept comparing Niall and Harry&rsquo;s actions, and she would always make herself sadder by the thought. Whatever Niall did, Harry would find a way to disclose the happy moment by reminding Y/N of what used to be and made her cautious of what could happen <i>again</i> if she let Niall come too close.</p><p>Y/N mumbled to herself quietly, trying to shut off the thoughts about how Niall will only hurt her. </p><p><i>&ldquo;What was that, Y/N?&rdquo;</i> He asked, plopping his bum down on the couch beside her. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I think you should leave</i></b>,&rdquo; She said so softly that Niall only got whisps of her sentence. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hmm? You wanna watch something else?</i>&rdquo; He grabbed the remote from the table in front of them. &ldquo;<i>I know you like rom-coms so maybe we&rsquo;ll watch that,&rdquo;</i></p><p>The TV flicked to the main menu. He browsed through the categories, briefly glancing at her. &ldquo;<i>Oi, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I think you should leave,&rdquo;</i></b> Y/N said more sternly. Guilt was eating up her inside. Somehow, it felt wrong to have Niall over while she was still thinking of her ex-boyfriend. It wasn&rsquo;t fair to him either.</p><p>Her statement made him drop the remote on his lap. He winced a little but his eyes widened in surprise. His mouth opened and close, not knowing what to say when someone asks you to leave. &ldquo;<i>Oh, d-did I do something wrong?&rdquo;</i></p><p>She shook her head &lsquo;<i>no</i>&rsquo;. &ldquo;<b><i>I just&mdash; I have stuff to do and I won&rsquo;t be able to focus,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Niall nodded understandingly, but he was still discombobulated by the sudden request to exit the building. He stood up, grabbing his phone on the table before wrapping his arms in his coat that he had hung by the door. His hand grasped the doorknob, looking at her for a final time before he left. &ldquo;<i>Y/N,&rdquo;</i></p><p>She looked up to him from her position on the couch, the tears she&rsquo;d tried to dry out spilling a little over her waterline, &ldquo;<i>Yeah?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for you,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Niall was worried for Y/N. Since the day she had asked him to leave, he hasn&rsquo;t seen much of her on campus. It was like she was avoiding him. Actually, he was certain that she <i>was</i> avoiding him because she recently switched seats to the other side of the room. She wouldn&rsquo;t even look on his direction, much less spare him a subtle wave or glance. He tried calling out her name one day after class, but he got no response from her. He could only watch as her head of hair disappeared among the mass crowd that hid her from him. </p><p>Y/N was disappointed in herself. She was aware of what she was doing this time. She was isolating herself and her pride wouldn&rsquo;t let her overcome the loop she&rsquo;d put herself in. Niall was getting closer to her faster than she had anticipated and it sent her into a frenzy. <i>Was she ready?</i> She didn&rsquo;t know if she was prepared to let somebody in again&ndash;even though Niall had squeezed himself in&ndash;she was scared.</p><p>She was shaking in her boots, teeth nipping on her fingernails as her eyes shifted from one corner of the room to the other because her mind couldn&rsquo;t stay quiet in the late hours of the night. Y/N was under the covers, hiding from the harsh reality of the world. <i>Would it be so wrong to let Niall in?</i> She so badly wanted to but there was a pull in her heart that warned her. She didn&rsquo;t know if she was being paranoid or there was something suspicious about Niall. </p><p>Nonetheless, Niall was very persistent in being in her life. He reached out to her in any way he knew how.; chased her after class, but she ignored it. He left voice messages on her phone when she failed to answer his calls. He spammed her with texts despite always being left on read. He was trying so hard and she was rejecting him with the same energy&ndash;pushing him away, yet he pushed back and with it, he polished off the ball that is Y/N&rsquo;s fear of abandonment, making it more real than she thought possible.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey H</i>,&rdquo; Niall greeted as Harry opened the door to his apartment. He was over for the day to hang out and chill. The two boys haven&rsquo;t done so in a while, especially with exams and assignments running at full speed. </p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, man?</i>&rdquo; Harry responded, leaning in for a hug.</p><p>Niall walked into the small living room&ndash;as Harry had instructed&ndash;while he gathered up some snacks and drinks to keep them filled while they caught up with each others&rsquo; lives. Minutes later, Harry and his bowl filled arms came into view. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>How&rsquo;s you and Dani?</i>&rdquo; Niall questioned. He remembered how Y/N&rsquo;s face looked when they talked about the topic before, and he was antsy to confirm the truth. </p><p><i>&ldquo;We broke up,</i>&rdquo; It was a solemn confession from him, but Harry was relieved.</p><p><i> &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>We just&ndash; we didn&rsquo;t work out</i>,&rdquo; Harry stuttered out an excuse. &ldquo;<i>How about you? Found anybody you like?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Niall cleared his throat, blinking rapidly as he was caught off guard of how quickly the question was directed to him. &ldquo;<i>Uh, yeah actually. Got my eye on someone,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Innit?</i>&rdquo; Harry punched Niall&rsquo;s knee in a teasing manner, &ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s her name? Do I know her?&rdquo;</i> He took a gulp from canned ice tea, filling his cheeks with the slightly chilled beverage. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Her name&rsquo;s Y/N,</i>&rdquo; Niall watched carefully as Harry&rsquo;s eyes widened, fighting himself from spilling the liquid out of his mouth. <i>&ldquo;Not sure if it&rsquo;s *your Y/N, though,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry asked him what <i>that</i> Y/N looked like and from the way Niall as eyeing him cautiously, he knew that both of them were tiptoeing on a topic that was bound to make them face the truth. And when Niall described Y/N&rsquo;s appearance first, Harry couldn&rsquo;t help but envision a perfect image of her in his mind&mdash;having not forgotten such a beautiful face. However, once Niall rambled in about her <i>&lsquo;perfect personality</i>&rsquo;; how she was nice and sweet, but humble and gentle&mdash;Harry felt his heart hurting because that totally sounded like <i>his </i>Y/N.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Does that sound like your Y/N?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry nodded, unable to deny something that was so undeniably true. It was quiet for minutes, neither of them saying a word to each other.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Harry</i>,&rdquo; Niall began. <i>&ldquo;Were you&mdash;did you leave Y/N for her sister?&rdquo;</i></p><p>He nodded hesitantly but nonetheless witnessed as hope vanished from Niall&rsquo;s baby blue eyes. He was praying that Harry wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing, but he was proven wrong. &ldquo;<i>I did, yeah, I-,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &hellip; not very nice,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I know that already?&rdquo;</i> Harry gassed, squinting his eyes. His nostrils were flaring from hearing the way Niall talked to him as if he didn&rsquo;t know that what he did was terrible. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get angry at me! I&rsquo;m just saying</i>,&rdquo; Niall raised his hands up in the air. <i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty fucked up man,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>I thought we were drifting. I had to get out before it got worse,</i>&rdquo; He gulped, trying to explain himself. &ldquo;<i>I didn&rsquo;t think I was gonna fall for Dani,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you should&rsquo;ve talked to Y/N first?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yes but sh-she,</i>&rdquo; Harry stuttered over his words. The simplest thing he could&rsquo;ve done to avoid this whole mess was to <i>talk</i> to Y/N, but it somehow managed to slip his mind. If he communicated with her, maybe they would&rsquo;ve fixed this and gone over the bump. <i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m going to talk&mdash;,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Niall phone buzzed loudly on the glass surface of the coffee table. He reached out to grab the device. &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s Y/N, I have to go,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry watched as Niall got up on his feet, waiting for him to do the same so he could bid him goodbye properly. The blonde patted the others&rsquo; shoulder firmly as if to reprimand him of his wrongdoing. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; </i></p><p>Niall looked over his shoulder, shrugging on his coat by the door. &ldquo;<i>Her place,&rdquo; </i></p><p>It was all Niall said before he unlocked the door and swung it open. Harry was left with his wandering thoughts that imagined filthy things going on between Y/N and his friend. He shook his head to get rid of them. </p><p>He sat on his love seat chair, legs spread widely as he covers his face with the expanse of his palm. He glanced up towards the ceiling, silently praying to a God that would be able to help him figure hot to cure the ache in his heart know that Y/N was progressing from him and slowly replacing him. He had no right to be angry but he couldn&rsquo;t help but want to burst into her place and blame her for moving on too fast; for not even trying to fix them before she let the fire between them simmer. But Harry knew that she was doing the best thing that she can for herself, and as much as he didn&rsquo;t want her to&mdash;he was a selfish man and Harry wanted Y/N all to himself. </p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost done!</i></b>&rdquo; Y/N exclaimed excitedly from across Niall. They were in her bedroom, sat on her bed with papers surrounding both of them. Her laptop jostled over from her lap when she bounced from the knowledge that their efforts would soon dwindle when they finish this assignment. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Oi, calm down Y/N. I have to focus,</i>&rdquo; Niall replied as he but his lip. Fingers typing on the keyboard to finish the last bits of information needed on the &lsquo;<i>reference</i>&rsquo; page. </p><p>Y/N pouted at being reprimanded but she let her eyes dance on her own laptop screen as the pink line moved on the Google Doc that they were sharing. &ldquo;<i><b>Sorry, I&rsquo;m excited to relax,&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>It was true. Since Niall arrived, they&rsquo;ve hit it straight to the ballpark. They&rsquo;ve not had a break since hours ago and her stomach was rumbling with need. </p><p><i>&ldquo;And done!</i>&rdquo; Niall accentuated his words with a final tap to his keyboard&mdash;submitting an assignment had never felt better than it did right at this moment. </p><p>Y/N gathered the papers in a neat pile before placing them in a blue folder. Niall shut down his computer, preparing to pack for his departure for the night. <i><b>&ldquo;Where are you going, Ni?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He paused, halfway to zipping his bag when she asked him that. &ldquo;<i>Uh, my place?</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s</b>,</i>&rdquo; Y/N glanced at her alarm clock. <i>&ldquo;<b>Eleven-thirty in the evening!&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>So</i>?&rdquo; Niall raises his brows in confusion.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;So? You can&rsquo;t go out that late,&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then where am I supposed to sleep tonight,</i>&rdquo; He replied. Y/N thought the idea over her head and concluded that it wouldn&rsquo;t be too big of a deal to let Niall stay the night. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Here, of course,&rdquo; </i></b>She places her school materials on her desk, clearing her bed of any clutter. </p><p><i>&ldquo;You want me,&rdquo;</i> He pointed at his chest. &ldquo;<i>To sleep here tonight?</i>&rdquo; Y/N nodded enthusiastically. </p><p>Y/N squealed as Niall landed on the spot beside her, body flopping against the mattress. He released a slight groan, &ldquo;<i>Ooo, your bed is comfy,&rdquo; </i></p><p>She giggled when he spread out his limbs purposely, shoving her off the bed eventually. &ldquo;<b><i>What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;&lsquo;M a big guy, I need all the space I can get,&rdquo;</i> Y/N puffed air out from her tightly closed lips, mocking his words. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not that big,&rdquo; </b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Size doesn&rsquo;t matter,</i>&rdquo; He mumbled the best he could with his cheek being squished against the soft pillows. </p><p>Y/N slapped his shoulder for his innuendo, instructing him to get up so that they could head to the kitchen and fix themselves some very late dinner. </p><p>Niall watched from his spot on her kitchen table as Y/N seemed to dance around from spot to spot, collecting ingredients and mixing them in the pot on the stove. His mouth watering with the delicious aroma wafting the air around him despite the exhaust fan above being turned on. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, I have a question,&rdquo;</i> She hummed in response. &ldquo;<i>Did Harry leave you for Dani?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N paused her movements, arm stuck frozen from its stirring position. He couldn&rsquo;t see her face and she was glad because she was sure that it must&rsquo;ve morphed into a crumpled expression. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Actually, you don&rsquo;t have to answer that,</i>&rdquo; Niall cleared his throat. &ldquo;<i>He was a jerk to do that. Harry, I mean,&rdquo;</i></p><p>He continued when Y/N didn&rsquo;t respond verbally. &ldquo;<i>I apologize for him. He&rsquo;s my friend and I&rsquo;m having a hard time comprehending that he could do something so vile,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But I want you to know that he doesn&rsquo;t deserve you,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N felt the warmth of his body against the expanse her back and she was rendered frozen once again. <b><i>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; </i></b></p><p>She could hear him chuckle breathily and for a moment, she smiled too.<i> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get over him, you know,</b></i>&rdquo; She sighed, finally turning around, only to be met with his broad chest. She stared at the white shirt that covered his skin, thinking through her next words. <i><b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard,&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;But being with you,&rdquo;</i></b> Y/N lifted a hand up to his chest, letting a finger trace lightly. Niall&rsquo;s heart quickened its pace, she could tell from the increasingly deeper breaths he took. She swore she could feel his heartbeat pounding through the barriers. </p><p>His hands touched her lower back gently just after he switched the stove knob off. He was afraid to take her by surprise when he felt her body tense, but it soon relaxed against his touch. Niall was looking at the top of her head because of his height advantage, and he so badly wanted to tilt her chin up and bore his eyes into her pretty ones. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;But with you, it gets easier.&rdquo; </b></i></p><p>And maybe it was stupid of Harry to impulsively visit Y/N at the slither of dusk, and even stupider when he put his key&ndash;that he never gave back to her&ndash;in the keyhole because she wasn&rsquo;t answering the door. His mind was fuzzy and he wasn&rsquo;t thinking clearly; maybe his knocks were too light against the wood of the door. He thought Y/N was ignoring him because he can clearly see a crack of light from underneath in front of his feet. It was the stupidest thing to enter her apartment, ready to softly call out her name. He can smell the food she&rsquo;d always especially make for him&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t just his mouth-watering, but his eyes as well because the root of the intoxicating scent was centered on the stove. He couldn&rsquo;t see the appliance because of two bodies blocking the way.&nbsp;</p><p>He really wished that he&rsquo;d just waited behind the closed door and not witness the sight in front of him.</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>okay so I said I was recurringly posting part 4 with pt3 but im late sO O WELL.

You said things in it that were not in the script.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEver heard\u00a0of improv? You went to school for it didn\u2019t you?\u201d He asked with a raised brow.<br/></p><p>\u201cCut the shit, Harry! You\u2019ve been acting weird all day and on top of that, you did that with the scene. Thomas may not have caught on but I have. I don\u2019t know what stuck up your ass to die but I\u2019m not having it. We have a job here, we gotta be convincing and if we\u2019re not convincing and be weird toward each other it\u2019s going to show!\u201d<br/></p><p>He looked at you for a while, as if he was thinking. Finally, he huffed, taking your hand and pulling you to his trailer.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know my problem?\u201d He started.\u00a0\u201cWhat happened last night at the bar that\u2019s my problem, and the many times before that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it\u2026what happened?\u201d You ask clearly confused.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhen I made the suggestion of you possibly falling in love with me during this.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re going need to narrow it down a bit. We always tease like that,\u201d you were so confused. What brought this all on? You two always made shameless comments all the time how could this bother him now?</p><p>\u201cYeah at first, but\u2026fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Harry muttered running his fingers through his hair again. \u201cWhen I said I actually could see myself with you I meant it. And you just\u2026laughed about it like it was some joke.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI thought you <i>were</i> joking Harry,\u201d you cross your arms.\u00a0\u201cAnd please do forgive me if I didn\u2019t catch on if you were serious or not since I\u2019ve seen you with half the Victoria\u2019s Secret Catalog.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Don\u2019t</i></b>,\u201d his tone got dangerous, a flash of pure anger across his usually gentle features.\u00a0\u201cI can deal with that with everyone else but <b><i>not</i></b> you. You know me, you know me for who I really am and\u2026we\u2019ve spent so much time together. I\u2026I\u2019ve always had feelings for you Y/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>He took a breath, as relieved that he was finally saying something.\u00a0\u201cIf I\u2019m honest I fell for you the second I saw you. And the more we hung out the more I felt for you. When you broke up with that Evan guy, and you called me crying\u2026when I came to your place and we just spent time together. That was one of my best moments with you\u2026when we were alone and I did everything just to get you to smile again. Because I want to be the one that makes you smile. I want to just\u2026hold your hand and kiss you. The way you laugh at my stupid jokes\u2026I love that. I don\u2019t get that\u2026certainly not with a\u00a0\u2018Catalog\u2019\u201d</p><p>You stood there eyes widen in shock. He\u2026he said <b><i>nothing</i></b> about that! He never flat out said,\u00a0\u201cHey I kinda dig you wanna go out?\u201d You shook your head, trying to process everything that went down.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2026Why didn\u2019t you say anything?!\u201d You asked voiced raised.</p><p>\u201cI did\u2026\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo! No, the hell you did not! You made hints, but you never flat out said it. I\u2019m not a god damn mind reader Harry!\u201d You could feel your anger building, he on the other hand still stood there very calm.<br/></p><p>\u201cWould you have said yes if I did say it? Would you have actually been with me if I said it before? Because that Victoria\u2019s Secret comment confirms otherwise.\u201d<br/></p><p>That caught you, he was right\u2026you were pissed but he was right. You hated it the second you said it. You knew he was more then what the media was putting on. You knew yourself how it worked but he always had the worse end of it. You felt a wave of guilt, eyes cast down in shame. Maybe he didn\u2019t need you as a friend if you still kept judging him without actually saying it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d you spoke, gulping a lump in your throat.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right I\u2026I\u2019ve been a shitty friend to you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d he commented.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2026I always liked you, Harry. I admit\u2026there had been moments when I thought myself I could see myself with you but\u2026I never thought you would find me that way.\u201d<br/></p><p>He took a breath, walking to you. You felt him hold your hands in his but you refused to look at him. You didn\u2019t deserve it if you were honest.<br/></p><p>\u201cI found that way for the longest time if I\u2019m to be fair\u2026I was with them to try and get my mind off you. But I couldn\u2019t. And this came and I just\u2026I was finally in your world. But Y/N\u2026I can\u2019t keep being your friend if all it\u2019s going to do is hurt me. I want to be with you\u2026so badly.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI do too,\u201d you spoke softly. You see one of his hands let go of your\u2019s, touching your chin to make you look at him.<br/></p><p>\u201cThen be with me. We have different lives but\u2026I\u2019m willing to make it work if you do too.\u201d<br/></p><p>You look at him, actually, look at him for the first time. No more teasing, no more jokes. He meant what he said. You could see the passion in his eyes. Finally, in a struck of nerves you nod to tell him yes. And finally, you got that goofy smile back from him. But this time? He leaned to kiss you, not as his character\u2026but as himself.</p><p>The reality was much better than fiction.</p>",

You went to school for it didn\u2019t you?\u201d He asked with a raised brow.<br></p><p>\u201cCut the shit, Harry! You\u2019ve been acting weird all day and on top of that, you did that with the scene. Thomas may not have caught on but I have. I don\u2019t know what stuck up your ass to die but I\u2019m not having it. We have a job here, we gotta be convincing and if we\u2019re not convincing and be weird toward each other it\u2019s going to show!\u201d<br></p><p>He looked at you for a while, as if he was thinking. Finally, he huffed, taking your hand and pulling you to his trailer.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know my problem?\u201d He started.\u00a0\u201cWhat happened last night at the bar that\u2019s my problem, and the many times before that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it\u2026what happened?\u201d You ask clearly confused.<br></p><p>\u201cWhen I made the suggestion of you possibly falling in love with me during this.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re going need to narrow it down a bit.

You two always made shameless comments all the time how could this bother him now?</p><p>\u201cYeah at first, but\u2026fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Harry muttered running his fingers through his hair again. \u201cWhen I said I actually could see myself with you I meant it. And you just\u2026laughed about it like it was some joke.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI thought you <i>were</i> joking Harry,\u201d you cross your arms.\u00a0\u201cAnd please do forgive me if I didn\u2019t catch on if you were serious or not since I\u2019ve seen you with half the Victoria\u2019s Secret Catalog.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Don\u2019t</i></b>,\u201d his tone got dangerous, a flash of pure anger across his usually gentle features.\u00a0\u201cI can deal with that with everyone else but <b><i>not</i></b> you.

And the more we hung out the more I felt for you. When you broke up with that Evan guy, and you called me crying\u2026when I came to your place and we just spent time together. That was one of my best moments with you\u2026when we were alone and I did everything just to get you to smile again. Because I want to be the one that makes you smile. I want to just\u2026hold your hand and kiss you. The way you laugh at my stupid jokes\u2026I love that. I don\u2019t get that\u2026certainly not with a\u00a0\u2018Catalog\u2019\u201d</p><p>You stood there eyes widen in shock. He\u2026he said <b><i>nothing</i></b> about that!

Because that Victoria\u2019s Secret comment confirms otherwise.\u201d<br></p><p>That caught you, he was right\u2026you were pissed but he was right. You hated it the second you said it. You knew he was more then what the media was putting on. You knew yourself how it worked but he always had the worse end of it. You felt a wave of guilt, eyes cast down in shame. Maybe he didn\u2019t need you as a friend if you still kept judging him without actually saying it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d you spoke, gulping a lump in your throat.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right I\u2026I\u2019ve been a shitty friend to you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d he commented.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026I always liked you, Harry.
