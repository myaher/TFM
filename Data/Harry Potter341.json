Her sweet giggles were contagious. She lights up the whole room just\nsitting there and looking pretty. From the moment she was born, her parents\nknew they didn\u2019t have to worry about their daughter\u2019s future. She would make a\nfine, well-bred pure-blood girl.</p><p>She thought she had everything\u2014her parents\u2019\nattention, the people\u2019s love\u2014until Astoria was born. Then they<i> </i>doted on <i>her</i>. Of course, she would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t jealous\nthe moment her parents stopped paying attention to her. At least the people\nstill loved her. From beyond family, she knew they could never abandon\nbeautiful Daphne over the wise Astoria.</p><p>But as she grew up in the spotlight of things, she\nsaw her baby sister struggle socially. Astoria would look up at Daphne in\nwonder, play with her golden gossamer hair happily and tell her how pretty she\nwas. It swelled her ego, but it deflated her heart to see her sister be snubbed\nfrom conversations with her friends, or children\u2019s games Astoria could easily\nplay. From that moment on, she would use her pretty face for advantageous\nthings. From then, she would use it to help her sister gain some friends.</p><p>At first, it was merely for the sake of advantages\nfor her sister. She would sweet talk her way into Theodore Nott\u2019s heart and bat\nher lashes at Draco Malfoy just so Astoria could come along. But eventually,\nshe began using it for herself. She found that being pretty could get you <i>anything</i>; men would fall on their knees,\nwomen would envy her and want to be her. It gave her the kind of power she had\ncraved, because <i>finally</i>, she had\nsomething for herself.</p><p>Daphne was known for\nher beauty. Astoria was known for her brains.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Seductive</i></b></p><p>Daphne found she was not smart, but she was\npretty\u2014and she used that to her needs.</p><p>A sharp gasp escaped her lips as Theo nipped harsh,\nbiting kisses against the length of her neck. They were pressed heatedly\ntogether against the wall just near Theo\u2019s dorm. She heard him murmur her name,\nover and over, like a prayer. She let him touch her everywhere; her neck, her\nbreasts, her ass\u2014everywhere any man could ever dream of touching her. Her lips\ncurled eerily. He was trapped in her spell.</p><p>The next day, Theodore Nott came to Potions class\nwithout his foot of parchment on Wiggenwald Potion. When Daphne tried to pass\nhers, Theo snatched her work and snapped.</p><p>\u201cThis is <i>my </i>work!\nWhat have you done to mine?\u201d Theo asked accusingly. \u201cDaphne, you copied my\nhomework!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Daphne\nsaid innocently, lips puckered out into a pout as Professor Snape took her work\nfrom Theo.</p><p>\u201cHow is this to be your work, Mr. Nott, if it is in\nthe delicate handwriting of Miss Greengrass?\u201d Professor Snape drawled out\nlazily.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c Theo protested angrily.</p><p>Theodore Nott got detention for challenging the\nprofessor.</p><p>Daphne still saw the\nashes of Theodore Nott\u2019s homework in the fireplace when she ambled back into\nthe common room.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe \u201cLoved\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201cOh, Daphne, it looks so pretty!\u201d Astoria gasped,\nbeaming at the bouquet of roses her sister received from her suitors. </p><p>Daphne scrunched up her nose. She <i>hated </i>roses. Anyone who thought sending\nher roses to earn her favor as a partner to the Malfoy Winter Ball was\ndelusional. For whoever truly knew her, they must know that carnations were her\nfavorite. They were delicate, soft, and the color of innocence\u2014which was the\nsheer irony she enjoyed in favoring it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky,\u201d Her little sister sighed as she\nplopped herself on Daphne\u2019s bed. \u201cYou\u2019re bound to find the love of your life\nsoon enough with all these pretty flowers you\u2019re getting from boys.\u201d</p><p>A tired sigh escaped Daphne\u2019s lips. Sometimes, her\nsister\u2019s naivety can be just as damning as hers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as love, Astoria.\u201d Daphne\ndrawled out lazily as she started chucking rose petals away from her vanity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Astoria giggled as she rolled her body on the bed to\nface her sister. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It only takes finding the right person is all.\u201d</p><p>Then, the young Greengrass\u2019s face sagged. \u201cI wish\nboys would send me flowers like they do with you. But I seem to make them run\nthe other way. Apparently, I have <i>strong\nopinions </i>that are unladylike for a pure-blood girl such as me. I fear that\nI\u2019m too boring for others.\u201d</p><p>This time, Daphne frowned before she whirled to meet\nher sister\u2019s gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>not </i>boring.\nYou\u2019ve got to stop saying that, or people will believe you.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Daphne didn\u2019t understand her smart sister.\nShe was pretty too, if she was being honest. And had brains she didn\u2019t have. Or\nperhaps she didn\u2019t understand men who simply look at Daphne because she was the\nprettiest. It\u2019s all she has to herself, anyway. The only ammunition she had to\ngetting to where she wanted\u2014though she didn\u2019t know just quite where that is\nyet. </p><p>Her sister, on the other hand, had many on her\narsenal. </p><p>Some women fear the fire. Some women simply become\nit. Like her sister.</p><p>Like her.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe New</i></b></p><p>Slowly, Daphne realized that people only loved her\nbecause she was pretty. Not because she was funny, or that she knew how to\nperform Charms even though her parents keep saying she doesn\u2019t need to excel as\nwell as Astoria, but because she was\u2026 <i>pretty.\n</i>The idea weighed a ton, enveloping the person she has become throughout the\nyears.</p><p>She found that she did not like how that was when\nBlaise Zabini told her he loved her one night, and was kissing a pretty\nRavenclaw girl the next day. Her whole life had been so focused on taking\nadvantage for her own needs that she didn\u2019t realize people took advantage of\nher for <i>their </i>needs as well. </p><p>It made her feel disgusted with herself. </p><p>So she tried to change. She tried to study harder,\ngetting help from Astoria on occasions. She tried to join extracurricular that\nhad nothing to do with her vanity. She even tried to join the Dueling club just\nso she\u2019d have some sort of variety\u2014<i>anything\n</i>that is far from the usual Daphne Greengrass norm.</p><p>But she found her attempts futile.</p><p>Her parents began to find out about the sudden turn\nin her life, and reprimanded her. They said she needs to stop doing what she\ndid, otherwise her beauty will peel at the edges. Otherwise, no rich pure-blood\nman would want her.</p><p>She had glared at her parents then. \u201cPansy is\nwell-involved academically, but a rich, pure-blood man like Draco Malfoy wants\nher.\u201d</p><p>They said her friend didn\u2019t count. Daphne wailed in\nfrustration.</p><p>How could she be\nsomeone new if her parents expected otherwise? </p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Seen</i></b></p><p>After her altercation with her parents, she started\nto wear the skin of the girl she used to be again. But deep down, she wanted to\nbe something else entirely. She wanted to be different, dynamic, and smart.\nMerlin, she wanted to <i>be </i>like her\nsister\u2014but, you know, <i>prettier</i>.</p><p>Daphne wore her cream-colored gown with the pride\nand confidence she held within herself. People stared at her golden hair that\nswished about as she moved, the elegant way she danced with the men in the\nball, and the way her face lights up every time she found something\nentertaining. Yes, people stared\u2014but they only stared at the surface, and not\nwhat was underneath.</p><p>Still, she carried herself with the confidence her\nmother taught her. But it was tiring, trying to look this way all at once as\nher resolve cracked from within.</p><p>\u201cDaphne, you look so beautiful in that dress,\u201d\nAstoria beamed at her brightly as she sported a lovely red gown. Her green eyes\nshifted towards a French boy eyeing her. \u201cOh, look. Florian seems to like it\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>A tired sigh escaped Daphne\u2019s lips as she smoothed\nher cream gown. \u201cI don\u2019t dress like this to impress men. I dress like this\nbecause I want to.\u201d</p><p>Astoria blushed, looking embarrassed. \u201cRight, of\ncourse! I just meant that he\u2019s been eyeing you all night. He seems desperate to\nspeak with you, but haven\u2019t done anything to do so.\u201d</p><p>Daphne pursed her lips, feeling her chest constrict.\n\u201cAstoria, can I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Her sister blinked at her in confusion, but bobbed\nher head eagerly. It made her heart sing. Her sister was an angel.</p><p>They spent the entire night in her room, still clad\nin their dresses, stomach-flat on the cream-colored rug of her bedroom, eating through\ntheir stomachs sick with Astoria\u2019s stash of sweets. Daphne told her sister\neverything. From the first moment she tried to charm the kids into playing with\nAstoria, to her using her looks into getting her homework \u201cdone\u201d, to attempting\nto be more than just a pretty face.</p><p>Astoria had been silent throughout her entire\ntirade, but she looked up at her and nodded at all the right moments. </p><p>When Daphne had finally bared her soul, the sisters\nwere silent. </p><p>\u201cI hate how people look at me,\u201d Daphne broke the\nsilence, turning a sugar quill between her fingers. \u201cAll they see on the\noutside. They see me as an\u2026 <i>object</i>.\nThey see me as nothing more than the pretty Greengrass girl waiting to be\nmarried off as a docile wife to some pure-blood boy. I need\u2026 no, <i>want </i>to be more than that. I want to be\nlike you.\u201d</p><p>Astoria smiled at her sister sadly. \u201cYou are better\nat so many things than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true.\u201d Daphne shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re more persuasive. Have you ever thought\nabout that?\u201d Astoria contradicted as she popped a chocoball in her mouth.\n\u201cPersuasive not because you\u2019re pretty, persuasive because you know how to worm\nyour way through an argument. You know how to undermine someone, and still make\na valid point of doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just speaking gibberish.\u201d Daphne laughed\nthis time, unable to believe the convoluted words her sister was producing. But\nshe did make some sense. After all, if Pansy ever needed to convince Draco of\nanything, she sends Daphne to do that dirty work. Most of the time, it works.</p><p>Another short silence befell them before Astoria\nspoke again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than just\na pretty face, Daphne.\u201d Astoria confirmed with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister. You\nare brave, loving and fierce and would never let anything bad happen to me. If\npeople don\u2019t see that, I suggest they get new eyes or shan\u2019t bother at all.\u201d</p><p>Daphne\u2019s heart swelled.\nHer sister truly was an angel.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Daphne</i></b></p><p>Daphne; golden-haired, plump lips, delicate tones.\nAfter the war, her pretty looks didn\u2019t matter much\u2026 for now. People were still\ngrieving, and had little time to appreciate the curve of her lips or the\nelegant sway of her hips. Granted, she missed the way they looked at her\u2014how\nthey appreciated her. But she had to remember the severity of what has\nhappened.</p><p>And as always, she used that to her advantage. But\nthis time, <i>for good</i>.</p><p>Her father, being a wizarding lawyer, had <i>plenty </i>of cases to take care of. But\nperhaps the biggest case that he simply found difficult to solve was Draco Malfoy\u2019s\ndefect in the war. He had failed to save Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban, and was\ndesperate to prove that he could do better with Lucius\u2019s son. </p><p>It tore her to see her father often tired, coming\nhome with Astoria, who had joined the family firm to intern for the summer and\nhelp their father with his cases. When she saw her father collapse tiredly on\nthe couch, she watched Astoria sit across the man, looking spent. Daphne\nentered the living room, knocking on the arch\u2019s frame.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d Daphne asked gently. \u201cTea?\nCoffee? Hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>Astoria\u2019s face lit up at the sight of her. \u201cHot\nchocolate would be lovely, please.\u201d</p><p>The moment Daphne came back with a tray full of mugs\nof hot chocolate, her father was still dozing off on the couch, but Astoria had\ntaken out the depositions and paper works. Papers were scattered in a\nsemi-circle before Astoria, the dark-haired girl looking through each of them\nwith precision.</p><p>Daphne skimmed through the pages as she placed the\ntray on the coffee table. She was almost too afraid to ask, but she built up\nthe confidence to do so anyway. \u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>Her sister failed to hide her relief. \u201cOf course you\ncan. Two heads are better than one. Maybe your <i>persuasive </i>skills can help us get this done.\u201d</p><p>In the end, her persuasive skills did get the work\ndone. One of her ideas inspired an even bigger idea in Astoria, to which she\ndeveloped and used to give to her father, though not without giving Daphne its\nfullest credit. Her father looked at her as though she had sprouted a new head,\nor rather, sprouted a new person.</p><p>Daphne found she could <i>never </i>get rid of her beauty. It\u2019s what\nmakes her Daphne. She has learned to accept that in spite of how people merely\nsee her only in that way. But she made sure that from now on, she would\nsurprise people with the person she wanted to be. Brave, loving, and fierce.\nAnd apparently as of late, persuasive.</p><p>For once, she had\nsomething else on her arsenal.</p><p>Finally, she was pretty\n<i>and </i>something else, and <b>more</b>.</p>",

Her sweet giggles were contagious. She lights up the whole room just\nsitting there and looking pretty. From the moment she was born, her parents\nknew they didn\u2019t have to worry about their daughter\u2019s future. She would make a\nfine, well-bred pure-blood girl.</p><p>She thought she had everything\u2014her parents\u2019\nattention, the people\u2019s love\u2014until Astoria was born. Then they<i> </i>doted on <i>her</i>. Of course, she would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t jealous\nthe moment her parents stopped paying attention to her. At least the people\nstill loved her. From beyond family, she knew they could never abandon\nbeautiful Daphne over the wise Astoria.</p><p>But as she grew up in the spotlight of things, she\nsaw her baby sister struggle socially. Astoria would look up at Daphne in\nwonder, play with her golden gossamer hair happily and tell her how pretty she\nwas. It swelled her ego, but it deflated her heart to see her sister be snubbed\nfrom conversations with her friends, or children\u2019s games Astoria could easily\nplay. From that moment on, she would use her pretty face for advantageous\nthings. From then, she would use it to help her sister gain some friends.</p><p>At first, it was merely for the sake of advantages\nfor her sister. She would sweet talk her way into Theodore Nott\u2019s heart and bat\nher lashes at Draco Malfoy just so Astoria could come along. But eventually,\nshe began using it for herself. She found that being pretty could get you <i>anything</i>; men would fall on their knees,\nwomen would envy her and want to be her. It gave her the kind of power she had\ncraved, because <i>finally</i>, she had\nsomething for herself.</p><p>Daphne was known for\nher beauty. Astoria was known for her brains.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Seductive</i></b></p><p>Daphne found she was not smart, but she was\npretty\u2014and she used that to her needs.</p><p>A sharp gasp escaped her lips as Theo nipped harsh,\nbiting kisses against the length of her neck. They were pressed heatedly\ntogether against the wall just near Theo\u2019s dorm. She heard him murmur her name,\nover and over, like a prayer. She let him touch her everywhere; her neck, her\nbreasts, her ass\u2014everywhere any man could ever dream of touching her. Her lips\ncurled eerily. He was trapped in her spell.</p><p>The next day, Theodore Nott came to Potions class\nwithout his foot of parchment on Wiggenwald Potion. When Daphne tried to pass\nhers, Theo snatched her work and snapped.</p><p>\u201cThis is <i>my </i>work!\nWhat have you done to mine?\u201d Theo asked accusingly. \u201cDaphne, you copied my\nhomework!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Daphne\nsaid innocently, lips puckered out into a pout as Professor Snape took her work\nfrom Theo.</p><p>\u201cHow is this to be your work, Mr. Nott, if it is in\nthe delicate handwriting of Miss Greengrass?\u201d Professor Snape drawled out\nlazily.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c Theo protested angrily.</p><p>Theodore Nott got detention for challenging the\nprofessor.</p><p>Daphne still saw the\nashes of Theodore Nott\u2019s homework in the fireplace when she ambled back into\nthe common room.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe \u201cLoved\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201cOh, Daphne, it looks so pretty!\u201d Astoria gasped,\nbeaming at the bouquet of roses her sister received from her suitors. </p><p>Daphne scrunched up her nose. She <i>hated </i>roses. Anyone who thought sending\nher roses to earn her favor as a partner to the Malfoy Winter Ball was\ndelusional. For whoever truly knew her, they must know that carnations were her\nfavorite. They were delicate, soft, and the color of innocence\u2014which was the\nsheer irony she enjoyed in favoring it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky,\u201d Her little sister sighed as she\nplopped herself on Daphne\u2019s bed. \u201cYou\u2019re bound to find the love of your life\nsoon enough with all these pretty flowers you\u2019re getting from boys.\u201d</p><p>A tired sigh escaped Daphne\u2019s lips. Sometimes, her\nsister\u2019s naivety can be just as damning as hers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as love, Astoria.\u201d Daphne\ndrawled out lazily as she started chucking rose petals away from her vanity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Astoria giggled as she rolled her body on the bed to\nface her sister. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It only takes finding the right person is all.\u201d</p><p>Then, the young Greengrass\u2019s face sagged. \u201cI wish\nboys would send me flowers like they do with you. But I seem to make them run\nthe other way. Apparently, I have <i>strong\nopinions </i>that are unladylike for a pure-blood girl such as me. I fear that\nI\u2019m too boring for others.\u201d</p><p>This time, Daphne frowned before she whirled to meet\nher sister\u2019s gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>not </i>boring.\nYou\u2019ve got to stop saying that, or people will believe you.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Daphne didn\u2019t understand her smart sister.\nShe was pretty too, if she was being honest. And had brains she didn\u2019t have. Or\nperhaps she didn\u2019t understand men who simply look at Daphne because she was the\nprettiest. It\u2019s all she has to herself, anyway. The only ammunition she had to\ngetting to where she wanted\u2014though she didn\u2019t know just quite where that is\nyet. </p><p>Her sister, on the other hand, had many on her\narsenal. </p><p>Some women fear the fire. Some women simply become\nit. Like her sister.</p><p>Like her.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe New</i></b></p><p>Slowly, Daphne realized that people only loved her\nbecause she was pretty. Not because she was funny, or that she knew how to\nperform Charms even though her parents keep saying she doesn\u2019t need to excel as\nwell as Astoria, but because she was\u2026 <i>pretty.\n</i>The idea weighed a ton, enveloping the person she has become throughout the\nyears.</p><p>She found that she did not like how that was when\nBlaise Zabini told her he loved her one night, and was kissing a pretty\nRavenclaw girl the next day. Her whole life had been so focused on taking\nadvantage for her own needs that she didn\u2019t realize people took advantage of\nher for <i>their </i>needs as well. </p><p>It made her feel disgusted with herself. </p><p>So she tried to change. She tried to study harder,\ngetting help from Astoria on occasions. She tried to join extracurricular that\nhad nothing to do with her vanity. She even tried to join the Dueling club just\nso she\u2019d have some sort of variety\u2014<i>anything\n</i>that is far from the usual Daphne Greengrass norm.</p><p>But she found her attempts futile.</p><p>Her parents began to find out about the sudden turn\nin her life, and reprimanded her. They said she needs to stop doing what she\ndid, otherwise her beauty will peel at the edges. Otherwise, no rich pure-blood\nman would want her.</p><p>She had glared at her parents then. \u201cPansy is\nwell-involved academically, but a rich, pure-blood man like Draco Malfoy wants\nher.\u201d</p><p>They said her friend didn\u2019t count. Daphne wailed in\nfrustration.</p><p>How could she be\nsomeone new if her parents expected otherwise? </p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Seen</i></b></p><p>After her altercation with her parents, she started\nto wear the skin of the girl she used to be again. But deep down, she wanted to\nbe something else entirely. She wanted to be different, dynamic, and smart.\nMerlin, she wanted to <i>be </i>like her\nsister\u2014but, you know, <i>prettier</i>.</p><p>Daphne wore her cream-colored gown with the pride\nand confidence she held within herself. People stared at her golden hair that\nswished about as she moved, the elegant way she danced with the men in the\nball, and the way her face lights up every time she found something\nentertaining. Yes, people stared\u2014but they only stared at the surface, and not\nwhat was underneath.</p><p>Still, she carried herself with the confidence her\nmother taught her. But it was tiring, trying to look this way all at once as\nher resolve cracked from within.</p><p>\u201cDaphne, you look so beautiful in that dress,\u201d\nAstoria beamed at her brightly as she sported a lovely red gown. Her green eyes\nshifted towards a French boy eyeing her. \u201cOh, look. Florian seems to like it\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>A tired sigh escaped Daphne\u2019s lips as she smoothed\nher cream gown. \u201cI don\u2019t dress like this to impress men. I dress like this\nbecause I want to.\u201d</p><p>Astoria blushed, looking embarrassed. \u201cRight, of\ncourse! I just meant that he\u2019s been eyeing you all night. He seems desperate to\nspeak with you, but haven\u2019t done anything to do so.\u201d</p><p>Daphne pursed her lips, feeling her chest constrict.\n\u201cAstoria, can I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Her sister blinked at her in confusion, but bobbed\nher head eagerly. It made her heart sing. Her sister was an angel.</p><p>They spent the entire night in her room, still clad\nin their dresses, stomach-flat on the cream-colored rug of her bedroom, eating through\ntheir stomachs sick with Astoria\u2019s stash of sweets.

I need\u2026 no, <i>want </i>to be more than that. I want to be\nlike you.\u201d</p><p>Astoria smiled at her sister sadly. \u201cYou are better\nat so many things than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true.\u201d Daphne shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re more persuasive. Have you ever thought\nabout that?\u201d Astoria contradicted as she popped a chocoball in her mouth.\n\u201cPersuasive not because you\u2019re pretty, persuasive because you know how to worm\nyour way through an argument. You know how to undermine someone, and still make\na valid point of doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just speaking gibberish.\u201d Daphne laughed\nthis time, unable to believe the convoluted words her sister was producing.

If\npeople don\u2019t see that, I suggest they get new eyes or shan\u2019t bother at all.\u201d</p><p>Daphne\u2019s heart swelled.\nHer sister truly was an angel.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Daphne</i></b></p><p>Daphne; golden-haired, plump lips, delicate tones.\nAfter the war, her pretty looks didn\u2019t matter much\u2026 for now.

But\nperhaps the biggest case that he simply found difficult to solve was Draco Malfoy\u2019s\ndefect in the war. He had failed to save Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban, and was\ndesperate to prove that he could do better with Lucius\u2019s son. </p><p>It tore her to see her father often tired, coming\nhome with Astoria, who had joined the family firm to intern for the summer and\nhelp their father with his cases. When she saw her father collapse tiredly on\nthe couch, she watched Astoria sit across the man, looking spent. Daphne\nentered the living room, knocking on the arch\u2019s frame.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d Daphne asked gently. \u201cTea?\nCoffee? Hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>Astoria\u2019s face lit up at the sight of her. \u201cHot\nchocolate would be lovely, please.\u201d</p><p>The moment Daphne came back with a tray full of mugs\nof hot chocolate, her father was still dozing off on the couch, but Astoria had\ntaken out the depositions and paper works. Papers were scattered in a\nsemi-circle before Astoria, the dark-haired girl looking through each of them\nwith precision.</p><p>Daphne skimmed through the pages as she placed the\ntray on the coffee table. She was almost too afraid to ask, but she built up\nthe confidence to do so anyway. \u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>Her sister failed to hide her relief. \u201cOf course you\ncan. Two heads are better than one. Maybe your <i>persuasive </i>skills can help us get this done.\u201d</p><p>In the end, her persuasive skills did get the work\ndone. One of her ideas inspired an even bigger idea in Astoria, to which she\ndeveloped and used to give to her father, though not without giving Daphne its\nfullest credit. Her father looked at her as though she had sprouted a new head,\nor rather, sprouted a new person.</p><p>Daphne found she could <i>never </i>get rid of her beauty. It\u2019s what\nmakes her Daphne. She has learned to accept that in spite of how people merely\nsee her only in that way. But she made sure that from now on, she would\nsurprise people with the person she wanted to be. Brave, loving, and fierce.\nAnd apparently as of late, persuasive.</p><p>For once, she had\nsomething else on her arsenal.</p><p>Finally, she was pretty\n<i>and </i>something else, and <b>more</b>.</p></p>",

Her sweet giggles were contagious. She lights up the whole room just\nsitting there and looking pretty. From the moment she was born, her parents\nknew they didn\u2019t have to worry about their daughter\u2019s future. She would make a\nfine, well-bred pure-blood girl.</p><p>She thought she had everything\u2014her parents\u2019\nattention, the people\u2019s love\u2014until Astoria was born. Then they<i> </i>doted on <i>her</i>. Of course, she would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t jealous\nthe moment her parents stopped paying attention to her. At least the people\nstill loved her. From beyond family, she knew they could never abandon\nbeautiful Daphne over the wise Astoria.</p><p>But as she grew up in the spotlight of things, she\nsaw her baby sister struggle socially. Astoria would look up at Daphne in\nwonder, play with her golden gossamer hair happily and tell her how pretty she\nwas. It swelled her ego, but it deflated her heart to see her sister be snubbed\nfrom conversations with her friends, or children\u2019s games Astoria could easily\nplay. From that moment on, she would use her pretty face for advantageous\nthings. From then, she would use it to help her sister gain some friends.</p><p>At first, it was merely for the sake of advantages\nfor her sister. She would sweet talk her way into Theodore Nott\u2019s heart and bat\nher lashes at Draco Malfoy just so Astoria could come along. But eventually,\nshe began using it for herself. She found that being pretty could get you <i>anything</i>; men would fall on their knees,\nwomen would envy her and want to be her. It gave her the kind of power she had\ncraved, because <i>finally</i>, she had\nsomething for herself.</p><p>Daphne was known for\nher beauty. Astoria was known for her brains.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Seductive</i></b></p><p>Daphne found she was not smart, but she was\npretty\u2014and she used that to her needs.</p><p>A sharp gasp escaped her lips as Theo nipped harsh,\nbiting kisses against the length of her neck. They were pressed heatedly\ntogether against the wall just near Theo\u2019s dorm. She heard him murmur her name,\nover and over, like a prayer. She let him touch her everywhere; her neck, her\nbreasts, her ass\u2014everywhere any man could ever dream of touching her. Her lips\ncurled eerily. He was trapped in her spell.</p><p>The next day, Theodore Nott came to Potions class\nwithout his foot of parchment on Wiggenwald Potion. When Daphne tried to pass\nhers, Theo snatched her work and snapped.</p><p>\u201cThis is <i>my </i>work!\nWhat have you done to mine?\u201d Theo asked accusingly. \u201cDaphne, you copied my\nhomework!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Daphne\nsaid innocently, lips puckered out into a pout as Professor Snape took her work\nfrom Theo.</p><p>\u201cHow is this to be your work, Mr. Nott, if it is in\nthe delicate handwriting of Miss Greengrass?\u201d Professor Snape drawled out\nlazily.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c Theo protested angrily.</p><p>Theodore Nott got detention for challenging the\nprofessor.</p><p>Daphne still saw the\nashes of Theodore Nott\u2019s homework in the fireplace when she ambled back into\nthe common room.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe \u201cLoved\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201cOh, Daphne, it looks so pretty!\u201d Astoria gasped,\nbeaming at the bouquet of roses her sister received from her suitors. </p><p>Daphne scrunched up her nose. She <i>hated </i>roses. Anyone who thought sending\nher roses to earn her favor as a partner to the Malfoy Winter Ball was\ndelusional. For whoever truly knew her, they must know that carnations were her\nfavorite. They were delicate, soft, and the color of innocence\u2014which was the\nsheer irony she enjoyed in favoring it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky,\u201d Her little sister sighed as she\nplopped herself on Daphne\u2019s bed. \u201cYou\u2019re bound to find the love of your life\nsoon enough with all these pretty flowers you\u2019re getting from boys.\u201d</p><p>A tired sigh escaped Daphne\u2019s lips. Sometimes, her\nsister\u2019s naivety can be just as damning as hers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as love, Astoria.\u201d Daphne\ndrawled out lazily as she started chucking rose petals away from her vanity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Astoria giggled as she rolled her body on the bed to\nface her sister. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It only takes finding the right person is all.\u201d</p><p>Then, the young Greengrass\u2019s face sagged. \u201cI wish\nboys would send me flowers like they do with you. But I seem to make them run\nthe other way. Apparently, I have <i>strong\nopinions </i>that are unladylike for a pure-blood girl such as me. I fear that\nI\u2019m too boring for others.\u201d</p><p>This time, Daphne frowned before she whirled to meet\nher sister\u2019s gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>not </i>boring.\nYou\u2019ve got to stop saying that, or people will believe you.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Daphne didn\u2019t understand her smart sister.\nShe was pretty too, if she was being honest. And had brains she didn\u2019t have. Or\nperhaps she didn\u2019t understand men who simply look at Daphne because she was the\nprettiest. It\u2019s all she has to herself, anyway. The only ammunition she had to\ngetting to where she wanted\u2014though she didn\u2019t know just quite where that is\nyet. </p><p>Her sister, on the other hand, had many on her\narsenal. </p><p>Some women fear the fire. Some women simply become\nit. Like her sister.</p><p>Like her.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe New</i></b></p><p>Slowly, Daphne realized that people only loved her\nbecause she was pretty. Not because she was funny, or that she knew how to\nperform Charms even though her parents keep saying she doesn\u2019t need to excel as\nwell as Astoria, but because she was\u2026 <i>pretty.\n</i>The idea weighed a ton, enveloping the person she has become throughout the\nyears.</p><p>She found that she did not like how that was when\nBlaise Zabini told her he loved her one night, and was kissing a pretty\nRavenclaw girl the next day. Her whole life had been so focused on taking\nadvantage for her own needs that she didn\u2019t realize people took advantage of\nher for <i>their </i>needs as well. </p><p>It made her feel disgusted with herself. </p><p>So she tried to change. She tried to study harder,\ngetting help from Astoria on occasions. She tried to join extracurricular that\nhad nothing to do with her vanity. She even tried to join the Dueling club just\nso she\u2019d have some sort of variety\u2014<i>anything\n</i>that is far from the usual Daphne Greengrass norm.</p><p>But she found her attempts futile.</p><p>Her parents began to find out about the sudden turn\nin her life, and reprimanded her. They said she needs to stop doing what she\ndid, otherwise her beauty will peel at the edges. Otherwise, no rich pure-blood\nman would want her.</p><p>She had glared at her parents then. \u201cPansy is\nwell-involved academically, but a rich, pure-blood man like Draco Malfoy wants\nher.\u201d</p><p>They said her friend didn\u2019t count. Daphne wailed in\nfrustration.</p><p>How could she be\nsomeone new if her parents expected otherwise? </p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Seen</i></b></p><p>After her altercation with her parents, she started\nto wear the skin of the girl she used to be again. But deep down, she wanted to\nbe something else entirely. She wanted to be different, dynamic, and smart.\nMerlin, she wanted to <i>be </i>like her\nsister\u2014but, you know, <i>prettier</i>.</p><p>Daphne wore her cream-colored gown with the pride\nand confidence she held within herself. People stared at her golden hair that\nswished about as she moved, the elegant way she danced with the men in the\nball, and the way her face lights up every time she found something\nentertaining. Yes, people stared\u2014but they only stared at the surface, and not\nwhat was underneath.</p><p>Still, she carried herself with the confidence her\nmother taught her. But it was tiring, trying to look this way all at once as\nher resolve cracked from within.</p><p>\u201cDaphne, you look so beautiful in that dress,\u201d\nAstoria beamed at her brightly as she sported a lovely red gown. Her green eyes\nshifted towards a French boy eyeing her. \u201cOh, look. Florian seems to like it\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>A tired sigh escaped Daphne\u2019s lips as she smoothed\nher cream gown. \u201cI don\u2019t dress like this to impress men. I dress like this\nbecause I want to.\u201d</p><p>Astoria blushed, looking embarrassed. \u201cRight, of\ncourse! I just meant that he\u2019s been eyeing you all night. He seems desperate to\nspeak with you, but haven\u2019t done anything to do so.\u201d</p><p>Daphne pursed her lips, feeling her chest constrict.\n\u201cAstoria, can I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Her sister blinked at her in confusion, but bobbed\nher head eagerly. It made her heart sing. Her sister was an angel.</p><p>They spent the entire night in her room, still clad\nin their dresses, stomach-flat on the cream-colored rug of her bedroom, eating through\ntheir stomachs sick with Astoria\u2019s stash of sweets. Daphne told her sister\neverything. From the first moment she tried to charm the kids into playing with\nAstoria, to her using her looks into getting her homework \u201cdone\u201d, to attempting\nto be more than just a pretty face.</p><p>Astoria had been silent throughout her entire\ntirade, but she looked up at her and nodded at all the right moments. </p><p>When Daphne had finally bared her soul, the sisters\nwere silent. </p><p>\u201cI hate how people look at me,\u201d Daphne broke the\nsilence, turning a sugar quill between her fingers. \u201cAll they see on the\noutside. They see me as an\u2026 <i>object</i>.\nThey see me as nothing more than the pretty Greengrass girl waiting to be\nmarried off as a docile wife to some pure-blood boy. I need\u2026 no, <i>want </i>to be more than that. I want to be\nlike you.\u201d</p><p>Astoria smiled at her sister sadly. \u201cYou are better\nat so many things than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true.\u201d Daphne shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re more persuasive. Have you ever thought\nabout that?\u201d Astoria contradicted as she popped a chocoball in her mouth.\n\u201cPersuasive not because you\u2019re pretty, persuasive because you know how to worm\nyour way through an argument. You know how to undermine someone, and still make\na valid point of doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just speaking gibberish.\u201d Daphne laughed\nthis time, unable to believe the convoluted words her sister was producing. But\nshe did make some sense. After all, if Pansy ever needed to convince Draco of\nanything, she sends Daphne to do that dirty work. Most of the time, it works.</p><p>Another short silence befell them before Astoria\nspoke again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than just\na pretty face, Daphne.\u201d Astoria confirmed with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister. You\nare brave, loving and fierce and would never let anything bad happen to me. If\npeople don\u2019t see that, I suggest they get new eyes or shan\u2019t bother at all.\u201d</p><p>Daphne\u2019s heart swelled.\nHer sister truly was an angel.</p><hr><p><b><i>To\nBe Daphne</i></b></p><p>Daphne; golden-haired, plump lips, delicate tones.\nAfter the war, her pretty looks didn\u2019t matter much\u2026 for now. People were still\ngrieving, and had little time to appreciate the curve of her lips or the\nelegant sway of her hips. Granted, she missed the way they looked at her\u2014how\nthey appreciated her. But she had to remember the severity of what has\nhappened.</p><p>And as always, she used that to her advantage. But\nthis time, <i>for good</i>.</p><p>Her father, being a wizarding lawyer, had <i>plenty </i>of cases to take care of. But\nperhaps the biggest case that he simply found difficult to solve was Draco Malfoy\u2019s\ndefect in the war. He had failed to save Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban, and was\ndesperate to prove that he could do better with Lucius\u2019s son. </p><p>It tore her to see her father often tired, coming\nhome with Astoria, who had joined the family firm to intern for the summer and\nhelp their father with his cases. When she saw her father collapse tiredly on\nthe couch, she watched Astoria sit across the man, looking spent. Daphne\nentered the living room, knocking on the arch\u2019s frame.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d Daphne asked gently. \u201cTea?\nCoffee? Hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>Astoria\u2019s face lit up at the sight of her. \u201cHot\nchocolate would be lovely, please.\u201d</p><p>The moment Daphne came back with a tray full of mugs\nof hot chocolate, her father was still dozing off on the couch, but Astoria had\ntaken out the depositions and paper works. Papers were scattered in a\nsemi-circle before Astoria, the dark-haired girl looking through each of them\nwith precision.</p><p>Daphne skimmed through the pages as she placed the\ntray on the coffee table. She was almost too afraid to ask, but she built up\nthe confidence to do so anyway. \u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>Her sister failed to hide her relief. \u201cOf course you\ncan. Two heads are better than one. Maybe your <i>persuasive </i>skills can help us get this done.\u201d</p><p>In the end, her persuasive skills did get the work\ndone. One of her ideas inspired an even bigger idea in Astoria, to which she\ndeveloped and used to give to her father, though not without giving Daphne its\nfullest credit. Her father looked at her as though she had sprouted a new head,\nor rather, sprouted a new person.</p><p>Daphne found she could <i>never </i>get rid of her beauty. It\u2019s what\nmakes her Daphne. She has learned to accept that in spite of how people merely\nsee her only in that way. But she made sure that from now on, she would\nsurprise people with the person she wanted to be. Brave, loving, and fierce.\nAnd apparently as of late, persuasive.</p><p>For once, she had\nsomething else on her arsenal.</p><p>Finally, she was pretty\n<i>and </i>something else, and <b>more</b>.</p></p>",

Her sweet giggles were contagious. She lights up the whole room just\nsitting there and looking pretty. From the moment she was born, her parents\nknew they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about their daughter&rsquo;s future. She would make a\nfine, well-bred pure-blood girl.</p><p>She thought she had everything&mdash;her parents&rsquo;\nattention, the people&rsquo;s love&mdash;until Astoria was born. Then they<i> </i>doted on <i>her</i>. Of course, she would be lying if she said she wasn&rsquo;t jealous\nthe moment her parents stopped paying attention to her. At least the people\nstill loved her. From beyond family, she knew they could never abandon\nbeautiful Daphne over the wise Astoria.</p><p>But as she grew up in the spotlight of things, she\nsaw her baby sister struggle socially. Astoria would look up at Daphne in\nwonder, play with her golden gossamer hair happily and tell her how pretty she\nwas. It swelled her ego, but it deflated her heart to see her sister be snubbed\nfrom conversations with her friends, or children&rsquo;s games Astoria could easily\nplay. From that moment on, she would use her pretty face for advantageous\nthings. From then, she would use it to help her sister gain some friends.</p><p>At first, it was merely for the sake of advantages\nfor her sister. She would sweet talk her way into Theodore Nott&rsquo;s heart and bat\nher lashes at Draco Malfoy just so Astoria could come along. But eventually,\nshe began using it for herself. She found that being pretty could get you <i>anything</i>; men would fall on their knees,\nwomen would envy her and want to be her. It gave her the kind of power she had\ncraved, because <i>finally</i>, she had\nsomething for herself.</p><p>Daphne was known for\nher beauty. Astoria was known for her brains.</p><hr /><p><b><i>To\nBe Seductive</i></b></p><p>Daphne found she was not smart, but she was\npretty&mdash;and she used that to her needs.</p><p>A sharp gasp escaped her lips as Theo nipped harsh,\nbiting kisses against the length of her neck. They were pressed heatedly\ntogether against the wall just near Theo&rsquo;s dorm. She heard him murmur her name,\nover and over, like a prayer. She let him touch her everywhere; her neck, her\nbreasts, her ass&mdash;everywhere any man could ever dream of touching her. Her lips\ncurled eerily. He was trapped in her spell.</p><p>The next day, Theodore Nott came to Potions class\nwithout his foot of parchment on Wiggenwald Potion. When Daphne tried to pass\nhers, Theo snatched her work and snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;This is <i>my </i>work!\nWhat have you done to mine?&rdquo; Theo asked accusingly. &ldquo;Daphne, you copied my\nhomework!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; Daphne\nsaid innocently, lips puckered out into a pout as Professor Snape took her work\nfrom Theo.</p><p>&ldquo;How is this to be your work, Mr. Nott, if it is in\nthe delicate handwriting of Miss Greengrass?&rdquo; Professor Snape drawled out\nlazily.</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo; Theo protested angrily.</p><p>Theodore Nott got detention for challenging the\nprofessor.</p><p>Daphne still saw the\nashes of Theodore Nott&rsquo;s homework in the fireplace when she ambled back into\nthe common room.</p><hr /><p><b><i>To\nBe &ldquo;Loved&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Daphne, it looks so pretty!&rdquo; Astoria gasped,\nbeaming at the bouquet of roses her sister received from her suitors. </p><p>Daphne scrunched up her nose. She <i>hated </i>roses. Anyone who thought sending\nher roses to earn her favor as a partner to the Malfoy Winter Ball was\ndelusional. For whoever truly knew her, they must know that carnations were her\nfavorite. They were delicate, soft, and the color of innocence&mdash;which was the\nsheer irony she enjoyed in favoring it.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so lucky,&rdquo; Her little sister sighed as she\nplopped herself on Daphne&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bound to find the love of your life\nsoon enough with all these pretty flowers you&rsquo;re getting from boys.&rdquo;</p><p>A tired sigh escaped Daphne&rsquo;s lips. Sometimes, her\nsister&rsquo;s naivety can be just as damning as hers.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as love, Astoria.&rdquo; Daphne\ndrawled out lazily as she started chucking rose petals away from her vanity.\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fantasy.&rdquo;</p><p>Astoria giggled as she rolled her body on the bed to\nface her sister. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. It only takes finding the right person is all.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, the young Greengrass&rsquo;s face sagged. &ldquo;I wish\nboys would send me flowers like they do with you. But I seem to make them run\nthe other way. Apparently, I have <i>strong\nopinions </i>that are unladylike for a pure-blood girl such as me. I fear that\nI&rsquo;m too boring for others.&rdquo;</p><p>This time, Daphne frowned before she whirled to meet\nher sister&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>not </i>boring.\nYou&rsquo;ve got to stop saying that, or people will believe you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes Daphne didn&rsquo;t understand her smart sister.\nShe was pretty too, if she was being honest. And had brains she didn&rsquo;t have. Or\nperhaps she didn&rsquo;t understand men who simply look at Daphne because she was the\nprettiest. It&rsquo;s all she has to herself, anyway. The only ammunition she had to\ngetting to where she wanted&mdash;though she didn&rsquo;t know just quite where that is\nyet. </p><p>Her sister, on the other hand, had many on her\narsenal. </p><p>Some women fear the fire. Some women simply become\nit. Like her sister.</p><p>Like her.</p><hr /><p><b><i>To\nBe New</i></b></p><p>Slowly, Daphne realized that people only loved her\nbecause she was pretty. Not because she was funny, or that she knew how to\nperform Charms even though her parents keep saying she doesn&rsquo;t need to excel as\nwell as Astoria, but because she was&hellip; <i>pretty.\n</i>The idea weighed a ton, enveloping the person she has become throughout the\nyears.</p><p>She found that she did not like how that was when\nBlaise Zabini told her he loved her one night, and was kissing a pretty\nRavenclaw girl the next day. Her whole life had been so focused on taking\nadvantage for her own needs that she didn&rsquo;t realize people took advantage of\nher for <i>their </i>needs as well. </p><p>It made her feel disgusted with herself. </p><p>So she tried to change. She tried to study harder,\ngetting help from Astoria on occasions. She tried to join extracurricular that\nhad nothing to do with her vanity. She even tried to join the Dueling club just\nso she&rsquo;d have some sort of variety&mdash;<i>anything\n</i>that is far from the usual Daphne Greengrass norm.</p><p>But she found her attempts futile.</p><p>Her parents began to find out about the sudden turn\nin her life, and reprimanded her. They said she needs to stop doing what she\ndid, otherwise her beauty will peel at the edges. Otherwise, no rich pure-blood\nman would want her.</p><p>She had glared at her parents then. &ldquo;Pansy is\nwell-involved academically, but a rich, pure-blood man like Draco Malfoy wants\nher.&rdquo;</p><p>They said her friend didn&rsquo;t count. Daphne wailed in\nfrustration.</p><p>How could she be\nsomeone new if her parents expected otherwise? </p><hr /><p><b><i>To\nBe Seen</i></b></p><p>After her altercation with her parents, she started\nto wear the skin of the girl she used to be again. But deep down, she wanted to\nbe something else entirely. She wanted to be different, dynamic, and smart.\nMerlin, she wanted to <i>be </i>like her\nsister&mdash;but, you know, <i>prettier</i>.</p><p>Daphne wore her cream-colored gown with the pride\nand confidence she held within herself. People stared at her golden hair that\nswished about as she moved, the elegant way she danced with the men in the\nball, and the way her face lights up every time she found something\nentertaining. Yes, people stared&mdash;but they only stared at the surface, and not\nwhat was underneath.</p><p>Still, she carried herself with the confidence her\nmother taught her. But it was tiring, trying to look this way all at once as\nher resolve cracked from within.</p><p>&ldquo;Daphne, you look so beautiful in that dress,&rdquo;\nAstoria beamed at her brightly as she sported a lovely red gown. Her green eyes\nshifted towards a French boy eyeing her. &ldquo;Oh, look. Florian seems to like it\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>A tired sigh escaped Daphne&rsquo;s lips as she smoothed\nher cream gown. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dress like this to impress men. I dress like this\nbecause I want to.&rdquo;</p><p>Astoria blushed, looking embarrassed. &ldquo;Right, of\ncourse! I just meant that he&rsquo;s been eyeing you all night. He seems desperate to\nspeak with you, but haven&rsquo;t done anything to do so.&rdquo;</p><p>Daphne pursed her lips, feeling her chest constrict.\n&ldquo;Astoria, can I talk to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Her sister blinked at her in confusion, but bobbed\nher head eagerly. It made her heart sing. Her sister was an angel.</p><p>They spent the entire night in her room, still clad\nin their dresses, stomach-flat on the cream-colored rug of her bedroom, eating through\ntheir stomachs sick with Astoria&rsquo;s stash of sweets. Daphne told her sister\neverything. From the first moment she tried to charm the kids into playing with\nAstoria, to her using her looks into getting her homework &ldquo;done&rdquo;, to attempting\nto be more than just a pretty face.</p><p>Astoria had been silent throughout her entire\ntirade, but she looked up at her and nodded at all the right moments. </p><p>When Daphne had finally bared her soul, the sisters\nwere silent. </p><p>&ldquo;I hate how people look at me,&rdquo; Daphne broke the\nsilence, turning a sugar quill between her fingers. &ldquo;All they see on the\noutside. They see me as an&hellip; <i>object</i>.\nThey see me as nothing more than the pretty Greengrass girl waiting to be\nmarried off as a docile wife to some pure-blood boy. I need&hellip; no, <i>want </i>to be more than that. I want to be\nlike you.&rdquo;</p><p>Astoria smiled at her sister sadly. &ldquo;You are better\nat so many things than me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not true.&rdquo; Daphne shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re more persuasive. Have you ever thought\nabout that?&rdquo; Astoria contradicted as she popped a chocoball in her mouth.\n&ldquo;Persuasive not because you&rsquo;re pretty, persuasive because you know how to worm\nyour way through an argument. You know how to undermine someone, and still make\na valid point of doing so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just speaking gibberish.&rdquo; Daphne laughed\nthis time, unable to believe the convoluted words her sister was producing. But\nshe did make some sense. After all, if Pansy ever needed to convince Draco of\nanything, she sends Daphne to do that dirty work. Most of the time, it works.</p><p>Another short silence befell them before Astoria\nspoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re more than just\na pretty face, Daphne.&rdquo; Astoria confirmed with a smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my sister. You\nare brave, loving and fierce and would never let anything bad happen to me. If\npeople don&rsquo;t see that, I suggest they get new eyes or shan&rsquo;t bother at all.&rdquo;</p><p>Daphne&rsquo;s heart swelled.\nHer sister truly was an angel.</p><hr /><p><b><i>To\nBe Daphne</i></b></p><p>Daphne; golden-haired, plump lips, delicate tones.\nAfter the war, her pretty looks didn&rsquo;t matter much&hellip; for now. People were still\ngrieving, and had little time to appreciate the curve of her lips or the\nelegant sway of her hips. Granted, she missed the way they looked at her&mdash;how\nthey appreciated her. But she had to remember the severity of what has\nhappened.</p><p>And as always, she used that to her advantage. But\nthis time, <i>for good</i>.</p><p>Her father, being a wizarding lawyer, had <i>plenty </i>of cases to take care of. But\nperhaps the biggest case that he simply found difficult to solve was Draco Malfoy&rsquo;s\ndefect in the war. He had failed to save Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban, and was\ndesperate to prove that he could do better with Lucius&rsquo;s son. </p><p>It tore her to see her father often tired, coming\nhome with Astoria, who had joined the family firm to intern for the summer and\nhelp their father with his cases. When she saw her father collapse tiredly on\nthe couch, she watched Astoria sit across the man, looking spent. Daphne\nentered the living room, knocking on the arch&rsquo;s frame.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you need anything?&rdquo; Daphne asked gently. &ldquo;Tea?\nCoffee? Hot chocolate?&rdquo;</p><p>Astoria&rsquo;s face lit up at the sight of her. &ldquo;Hot\nchocolate would be lovely, please.&rdquo;</p><p>The moment Daphne came back with a tray full of mugs\nof hot chocolate, her father was still dozing off on the couch, but Astoria had\ntaken out the depositions and paper works. Papers were scattered in a\nsemi-circle before Astoria, the dark-haired girl looking through each of them\nwith precision.</p><p>Daphne skimmed through the pages as she placed the\ntray on the coffee table. She was almost too afraid to ask, but she built up\nthe confidence to do so anyway. &ldquo;Can I help?&rdquo;</p><p>Her sister failed to hide her relief. &ldquo;Of course you\ncan. Two heads are better than one. Maybe your <i>persuasive </i>skills can help us get this done.&rdquo;</p><p>In the end, her persuasive skills did get the work\ndone. One of her ideas inspired an even bigger idea in Astoria, to which she\ndeveloped and used to give to her father, though not without giving Daphne its\nfullest credit. Her father looked at her as though she had sprouted a new head,\nor rather, sprouted a new person.</p><p>Daphne found she could <i>never </i>get rid of her beauty. It&rsquo;s what\nmakes her Daphne. She has learned to accept that in spite of how people merely\nsee her only in that way. But she made sure that from now on, she would\nsurprise people with the person she wanted to be. Brave, loving, and fierce.\nAnd apparently as of late, persuasive.</p><p>For once, she had\nsomething else on her arsenal.</p><p>Finally, she was pretty\n<i>and </i>something else, and <b>more</b>.</p></p>",
