I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He takes a step in front of her and hands the cash to the cashier. She looks up at the man who&rsquo;d just paid for her coffee, giving him a stare which could only mean &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;. He nods as she puts her things back into her bag; a few receipts, a little black book, some pens and her phone. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi Harry.&rdquo; Cassidy the cashier greets, &ldquo;Just the usual?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, thanks, mind addin&rsquo; a blueberry muffin with tha&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; She replies with a smile. The girl, who Harry&rsquo;s paid a coffee for, waits for him to grab his order. She&rsquo;s hesitent. Just for a moment though. As he walks out, she chases after him. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; The wind blows against her face, making her hair fly just across it. Harry turns around to be met by your soft features. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just wanted to thank you,&rdquo; you gestured to your take-away cup, &ldquo;life savior, you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S'all good&hellip;&rdquo; Waiting for you to answer with your name.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, my name&rsquo;s Y/N.&rdquo; You lend out your hand for him to shake, in which he does, &ldquo;How can I pay you back?&rdquo; He pauses for a moment and smiles. </p><p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; don&rsquo; forget yeh wallet next time, though, I won&rsquo; hold it against yeh if yeh do, I won&rsquo; complain.&rdquo; You giggled and nodded as he walked away. </p><p>Harry is sweet.</p></p>",

I wasn\u2019t in a hurry to see it but I also wasn\u2019t\ntaking my time and prolonging it any longer then what it needed to be. Liz\u2019s\neyes felt like hot pokers stabbing at my skin as I started pull the thin pages\nout. Liz\u2019s eyes were bad but Harry\u2019s felt like torture. My eyes flicked up to\nlook at him once the top of the pages was visible. His eyes were already\nwatering and his jaw was clenched tightly as he looked down at my shaking\nhands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d He whispered when he noticed I was\nlooking up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t care what this piece of paper says, I love you and\nNora so fucking much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I whispered, tilting my head back so I\ncould press a soft kiss to his lips.</p><!-- more --><p>Harry\u2019s lips ghosted over mine, fingers flexing around mine\nas he kissed me back lightly. Liz was still in the room so he couldn\u2019t kiss me\nas hard as I wanted him to but the smaller kisses he gave showed his love for\nme a thousand times stronger than his deeper, harder kisses. </p><p>Pulling away from him I took the tops of the pages back in\nmy hand and slowly edged them out of the envelope. Harry pressed small kisses\nagainst my forehead as I breathed out shakily. </p><p>Hurriedly I read over the words at the top of the page.\nWhatever they were, they were scientific and medical and meant more for Liz\nthen me and I skipped over them without a second thought. As I continued to\nread down the page I started to hyperventilate and I felt my heart hammer\nagainst my chest like a sharp beating drum. </p><p>Once my watery eyes find the information I want, my breath\ncatches in my throat and Harry tenses up completely beside me preparing himself\nfor bad news. A small sob left my mouth as I read the result and I quickly\nreached a hand up to cover my mouth.</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d Harry asked tensely as I continued to stare at the\nname that had 99.8% paternity written next to it. The paper was shaking with my\nhand and I had started to full on cry now. \u201cIs it Luke?\u201d Harry continued, his\nvoice the tightest I had ever heard it.</p><p>Snapping out of my shock I turned to look back up at Harry, my\neyes watering. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Harry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I whispered, voice cracking. </p><p>Seeing that Nora was Luke\u2019s hurt but not nearly as much as\nit hurt to watch the last fraction of hope flicker from Harry\u2019s confident green\neyes. He had been by me every step of the way, he had felt her kicks, been there\nfor her ultrasounds, he had been there for everything and I could tell that he\nhad really felt she was his.</p><p>Harry dropped his head forward and rested it on my shoulder.\nFrom the corner of my eye I watched Liz leave the room as I reached my hand up\nto it into Harry\u2019s hair, pepper soft kisses against his forehead that mixed\nwith the salty taste of my tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I said again, my hand tugging at his hair\ngently.</p><p>I truly was. He didn\u2019t deserve this, after everything he did\nfor the both of us, he deserved to have the higher percentage printed next to\nhis name, not Luke.</p><p>Harry breathed in deeply and at the same time I felt a tear\ndrop soak the material of my t-shirt. I felt the soft caress of his hand move\nover my belly and I felt more tears slide over my cheek with how gentle he was\ncaressing me.</p><p>Pulling back, he looked up at me with a heavy sigh, his chin\nresting on my shoulder. \u201cStill love you, both of you. Still my little girl, she\nis.\u201d His fingers scratched over my belly as he forced a sad smile on to his\nface. </p><p>A smile grew across my cheeks and I tugged him towards me so\nI could press a quick kiss to my lips. \u201cCan already tell she loves you. Every\nconcert I could feel her moving around, almost like she was dancing to the\nsound of your voice.\u201d </p><p>Harry bit his lip and finally I saw a flash of genuine\nhappiness in his eyes. He had said that the piece of paper didn\u2019t matter and I\ndidn\u2019t real get what he meant till now. Nora reacted to him, she liked the\nsound of his voice, her movements told me that the sound of his voice comforted\nher and made her feel safe despite Harry not being her biological father.</p><p>\u201cMy baby girl.\u201d He whispered, the warmth of his hand still\non my belly, right where Nora was staring to kick.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Liz had to take a deep breath as she shut the door to her\noffice. She had genuinely started to believe that Harry was going to be Nora\u2019s\ndad and the broken way that Evie had apologised to him broke her heart. </p><p>She didn\u2019t have kids herself, instead she a had a very\nstrong connection to the most special delivers that she did and Evangeline\nJones was her first and most special of them all. Oliver was not only her ex\u2019s\nbest friend but he was also hers and through him she met Nora and Nora was\nsomeone she could go to for absolutely everything. </p><p>She cried for a week after their death because she just\ncouldn\u2019t believe that two of the most important amazing people in her life were\ngone in seconds. A snap of gods fingers or something like that. Gone. Now she\ncouldn\u2019t see how their equally amazing daughter was getting completely fucked\nover by some douche that didn\u2019t deserve her or the little girl she carried.</p><p>The last thing she wanted to be doing right now was to be\ncalling said douche but she knew it was better for her to do it then Evie.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d A deep voice answers after only a few rings. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLuke, it\u2019s Dr May. How are you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Luke cleared his throat and she could hear him tell\nsomeone he would be back. \u201cI\u2019m great, how are you? Did the results come back?\u201d</p><p>Liz swallowed, she didn\u2019t want to do this and for a small\nsecond, she thought about lying before deciding against it. \u201cI\u2019m doing well.\nThe results did come back and congratulations you\u2019re going to be a dad.\u201d She\nwanted to add a resentful \u2018again\u2019 to the end but decided against it one more\ntime.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s, she\u2019s mine.\u201d He stuttered out.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is yours. Is there anything you want to know?\u201d If\nshe weren\u2019t a professional Doctor she would have already hung up on him.</p><p>\u201cYes, when\u2019s Evie\u2019s next appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my understanding of the current restraining order and\ncustody agreement between you and Evie, the only information I can give you is\nabout your daughters health. In that regards she is okay, growing very\nhealthily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, are you saying I can\u2019t go to any of the natal\nappointments for my daughter?\u201d Liz could sense that Luke was getting very angry\non the other end of the phone and was very glad that Evie didn\u2019t have to deal\nwith this.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have anything to do with Evie until the baby is\nborn. This is because of a health risk to both Evie and the baby, like I said I\ncan tell you anything you want to about the baby\u2019s health but you can\u2019t\ninteract with Evie at all.\u201d Luke could have seriously hurt both Evie and Nora\nthat day in the hospital and she had to roll her eyes at his obliviousness to\nnot realising his distance was for the health of his daughter.</p><p>\u201cSo, I won\u2019t be able to be there for her birth either.\u201d This\ntime Luke sounded defeated and he felt defeated as well. He already knew he\nwasn\u2019t going to be able to see his daughter\u2019s entry into the world. </p><p>\u201cLondon Hospital only allows two family or friends in the\nroom at the time of the birth, which is Grace and,\u201d she hesitated before saying\nthe next name. </p><p>Luke already knew and he rolled his eyes, resisting the urge\nto swear loudly and vent all his frustrations. He couldn\u2019t even do that because\nCarly was trying to sleep in the other room and he didn\u2019t want to disturb her. </p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. Fuck Luke really\ndid hate him and the thing he hated most was that he was good to Evie. He was\nthe type of good that Evie needed but he could never give her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liz slowly replied. \u201cIf you want to be there, you\ncould talk to you lawy,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupted. If he wanted to stay in good terms\nwith Evie he needed to keep her happy and if Harry did that he wasn\u2019t going to\ntry and kick him out of the room when Evie was at her most vulnerable and he definitely\ncouldn\u2019t kick Grace out either. \u201cIf that\u2019s what Evie wants. Can you call me\nafter all her appointments or if something happens?\u201d </p><p>Luke\u2019s mind jumped back to see Evie in the hospital bed. She\nhad looked so scared and tired in that bed, then she was hooked up to so many\ndifferent machines that he knew there was something wrong with his baby and that\nscared him half to death. He didn\u2019t want her to end up back there. </p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Liz felt the smallest bit of sympathy for Luke then\nbut it quickly vanished when he remembered the shattered look on Evie and\nHarry\u2019s face not even an hour ago.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry whispered, hand carding through my hair. \u201cI\ncalled Luke. He\u2019s already here at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d my voice cracked and I forced my eyes open to look\nat him.</p><p>Harry was sat at the side of my bed and when my eyes\ngroggily opened he offered me a soft smile fingers messaging my scalp. I felt\ntired and so sore, I was desperate for a hug from him but even the thought of\nhim touching me anywhere hurt. </p><p>\u201cLuke, I called him to tell him you were in labour and he\nsaid that he was already here with Carly. Their little boy was born yesterday.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201c\u2019s not fair.\u201d I slurred, reaching a hand up and dropping it\nover his. My hold was light and Harry frowned at it. Whether he was upset at my\nhold or the entire situation we were in I don\u2019t know and I was too tired to\nthink about it. </p><p>Harry shook his head and pulled my hand down to press a kiss\nagainst the back of it, careful to avoid hitting the IV. \u201cI know but we can\nmake the most of it. We\u2019re married now. She\u2019ll still have my name and I\u2019ll be\nher guardian. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext one is yours.\u201d I smiled up at him, fighting to keep my\neyes open. </p><p>Harry chuckled quickly and pressed another kiss to the back\nof my hand. \u201cI hope so. You\u2019re stuck with me now Mrs Styles. Go back to sleep\nbaby.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHm, you\u2019re so perfect.\u201d Harry said to Nora who was bundled\nup in his arms, wrapped tight in a pink fluffy blanket that Gemma had gotten\nher.</p><p>I was beyond tired and ready to go to sleep but Luke still\nhadn\u2019t been in yet to see Nora and I wanted to be awake when he did. She was\nborn only an hour ago and I already had to pass her over to someone else. It\nhurt my heart, I wanted to cry but I was to tired to even do that.</p><p>\u201cI can tell Luke we need a few more hours.\u201d Harry said,\ndrawing my eyes from the little brown curls on Nora\u2019s head up to his green\neyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I shifted a bit so I could curl around the\nwarmth of Harry\u2019s back. He shifted Nora into one arm and reached back a hand to\nsoothe it over my arm. \u201cWant to get it over with so I can go back to sleep.\nAnne and Gemma don\u2019t want to wait any longer either.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips pulled up into a slight smile as he tugged the soft\nblanket up higher and tucked it around my neck. He had to be just as tired but\nhe was soldiering on through it being the strong one out of the pair of us. A\nquick knock on the door caused me to jump and my heart beat picked up quickly\nand I was starting to feel sick.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to let him in?\u201d Harry asked carefully, his\narm tightening protectively around Nora. </p><p>I nodded at him and gave a final look at my little girl\nbefore Harry stood up and headed towards the door. My heart was still beating\nfast and I felt insanely nauseous. I hadn\u2019t felt this sick since my first\ntrimester. </p><p>Harry opened the door to Luke and I took in a deep breath to\nsettle everything that felt off inside me. Luke looked a little pale and his\nhands were shaking as he slowly made his way into my room behind Harry so we\nwere in the privacy of my room. Luke flicked his eyes up to Harry after staring\nat Nora, there was shock in his blue eyes. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to hold her?\u201d Harry asked Luke after a minute\nwhen he didn\u2019t do anything. </p><p>I thought Luke would come in annoyed that Harry got to hold his\ndaughter before he did but no, he was stood there like a deer in headlights not\nbeing able to decide who to look at. Luke nodded nervously and reached out his\narms and very gingerly Harry transferred Nora over as I held on to a deep\nbreath watching the interaction. </p><p>Nora fussed a little at the transfer but quickly settled\ninto her dad\u2019s arms as he tucked her up close to his chest. Harry swallowed\ndeeply as he stepped backwards until he was sat back on the bed with me, his\nhand quickly finding mine, shaky fingers linking together.</p><p>Luke was quite for a moment, just admiring his little girl,\nfinger stroking over her features before looking back up to me with tear coated\neyes. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful Eve\u2019s. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I croaked out. \u201cTired and sore but okay.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes hadn\u2019t even passed and already I was desperate\nto have her back in my arms. I missed the warmth her little body gave me when I\nheld her, even the smell of her and right now she felt too far away and out of\nmy reach. Having Harry close really did help. I couldn\u2019t imagine how I would be\nable to get through this without him here.</p><p>Luke nodded as he sat down in the chair that only recently\nhad Grace in it. He cooed down at Nora and I heard her gurgle back up at him\nand my heart stuttered. This was going to be very difficult for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Harry leant over me, his voice dropping low so\nonly I could hear him. \u201cJust breathe, he\u2019ll be gone in half hour and you\u2019ll be\nholding her again.\u201d</p><p>I nodded up at him, my hand tightening around his as I kept\nmy mouth shut on what I really wanted to say. Every moment Luke held her made\nme feel like I was losing a bit of her love and even though it was selfish I\ndidn\u2019t care. I wanted to have the little perfect bundle all to myself.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought of any names?\u201d Luke interrupted the\nsilence of the room. </p><p>Harry drew back from me with a tense look. Luke didn\u2019t know\nI had already named her Nora, he also didn\u2019t know that Harry and I were married\nand that I had changed my last name.</p><p>\u201cNora. We wanted Nora Anne, after Harry\u2019s mum, but I\nunderstand why you wouldn\u2019t want Anne but I really need her name to be Nora.\u201d\nMy voice cracked and I felt myself start to cry. I had my heart set on Nora and\nI wasn\u2019t going to budge.</p><p>Luke sniffed and nodded at me. \u201cWhat about her last name?\nThat time at lunch, you said you wanted her to have yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hyphen it with yours. Styles-Williams.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyebrows furrowed and that seemed to be the first\ntime that he forgot about the baby in his arms. \u201cYour last name, not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyles is my last name. We got married a few weeks ago.\u201d I\nmumbled the words quietly but somehow Luke still heard me.</p><p>Luke cursed underneath his breath, running a hand over his\nface quickly. I could tell that this wasn\u2019t something he expected to hear but I\nwas happy that seemed to be the worst part of his reaction. The room was quiet\nfor a few seconds, the only sound coming from the monitor I still had attached\nto my finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with Nora, I understand how important that is to\nyou, I don\u2019t think I can do anything about the last name. Maybe not the middle\nname.\u201d Luke concentrated back down at Nora and the room was bathed back in\nawkward silence.</p><p>I could fight to get the middle name for Harry but not now.\nI was too tired and I wasn\u2019t going to fight in front of Nora, even when she was\nthis young.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><b>Six months later:</b></p><p>\u201cDo not throw up on me.\u201d Harry said intently to Nora who was\nsupposed to be having tummy time on the floor but was instead lying on Harry\u2019s\nchest who was lying on the living room floor amongst all her toys.</p><p>Nora\u2019s lips pulled up into a toothy smile and Harry smiled\nback at her despite how tense he was being with her only a few seconds ago. Shaking\nmy head, I smirked down at the two of them over the top of the manuscript I was\nslowly making my way through. Harry and Nora made for great distractions.</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it was your own fault for burping her\nwithout a towel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Gucci,\u201d he complained and quickly put his hand up to\nstop her from rolling off his chest. </p><p>A small chuckle passed my lips and Harry glared up at me\nbeneath his long lashes. The dry cleaner got the stain out of the shirt so he\ndidn\u2019t have a reason to be bitter about the shirt anymore. </p><p>The little family moment we were having was quickly\ninterrupted by a sharp knock at the door. Harry looked towards the door at the\nsame time I did but not before he bought his hands up to drop them over Nora\u2019s\nback as her smile quickly fell and she tried to snuggle into his chest.</p><p>Throwing the manuscript down onto the couch next to me I\nquickly hurried to the front door while Harry started to soothe Nora because\nthe loud knocking was quickly unsettling her.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d Luke was stood at the door, looking very frazzled\nand his hair had been ruffled up a lot as well. \u201cWhat the hell. I told you to\ntext before coming around.\u201d</p><p>Luke pushed past me into the house, shaking his head\nquickly. \u201cI know but I need to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke she won\u2019t go to you when you\u2019re like this.\u201d Hurriedly\nI followed behind him to where Harry was standing with Nora clutched\nprotectively to his chest.</p><p>I had adapted to Luke being around so often again. The\ncustody agreement was for one, three-hour visit a week but he was around three\ntimes a week to see Nora and I didn\u2019t mind it. He was being a father and that\u2019s\nall I wanted him to do. </p><p>When he came around like this, fuming and without any\nwarning it was always a mess. Nora never wanted to go to him and she would just\nscream until she was blue in the face and back cradled in my arms.</p><p>\u201cGive me my daughter Harry.\u201d Luke seethed but Harry didn\u2019t\nflinch.</p><p>\u201cCalm down first.\u201d Harry said evenly, hand gentle on Nora\u2019s\nback. </p><p>My heart started to race as Luke\u2019s anger grew tenfold. Nora\ncould sense his feelings and she started to cry into Harry\u2019s neck despite how\nmuch he attempted to soothe her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to calm down she\u2019s my fucking daughter and I\nwant to hold her.\u201d Luke\u2019s hands came up and grabbed Nora around her sides\ntrying to pull her back from Harry\u2019s tight hold.</p><p>That was when I saw red and I shot myself across the room as\nquickly as possible to put myself between Luke and Nora. I didn\u2019t care what was\ngoing on with him today, not that he ever told me what the problem was these\ndays, but I wasn\u2019t going to have him vent out all his issues with Nora so\nclose.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that I don\u2019t care how\noften you come around to see her but you cannot see her when you\u2019re this angry.\nIf you want to hold her today go outside and calm down first.\u201d</p><p>Luke scowled at me. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep her from me Evie.\u201d</p><p>Turning he stormed back out of the house, slamming the front\ndoor which caused me to flinch. Lifting a hand up I ran out over my face, my\nchest shaking with my heavy breathes as I heard the sound of tyres screeching\nout of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry said softly and Nora\u2019s loud cries drew me back\nto reality. Putting my hands up I tried to take her but Harry shook his head at\nme as well. \u201cYou need to calm down. You need to calm her down and you can\u2019t do\nthat when you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>I took a few deep breathes and tried to shut my mind off\nfrom what just happened and once Harry was satisfied he passed Nora over to me.\nI cuddled her tight to my chest, pressing small kisses against the side of her\nhead as I stepped back to be sat down on the couch. Harry followed, wrapping\nthe both of us up in his strong arms as he settled next to us.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t come around when he\u2019s like that. He could have\nhurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered into Nora\u2019s hair.</p><p>She was very slowly starting to calm down but Harry was\nright. Luke took it one step to far, he could have really hurt her by taking\nher from Harry like he did but he didn\u2019t even care. Whatever was happening in\nhis life made him blind to the safety of his daughter.</p><p><b>Eleven Months:</b></p><p>My finger slid over my phone as if I kept looking at it I\nwould magically receive a text from Luke. This wasn\u2019t like him. I hadn\u2019t seen\nhim in two weeks. Nora didn\u2019t seem fazed at all by the lack of visits but it\nwas confusing me that Luke suddenly went from two visits a week to not showing\nup or even texting me back to see what was happening.</p><p>\u201cStill nothing?\u201d Harry asked, watching Nora with furrowed\nbrows as she spooned her yogurt anywhere but into her mouth. It was dripping\ndown her face onto her bib and coated her cheeks but she refused to let Harry\nhelp her. </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I sighed dropping my phone down to the table.\nLeaning over I tried to take the spoon from Nora so she at least managed to get\nsome food into her but she squealed and turned away from me as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told him and you\u2019ve told his mum. You can\u2019t do\nanything more Evie, he needs to make the effort.\u201d Harry picked up his own spoon\nfrom his bowl of cereal, eyes soft as he looked over at me.</p><p>I hummed resting my chin in my hands as I rested my\nelbows on the table. I wasn\u2019t interested in my breakfast anymore, I felt to\nworried. Harry was right, I didn\u2019t need to be worrying over this, I had done\neverything I could have. Nora\u2019s first birthday was soon and I had invited Luke\nto come to her party but I hadn\u2019t gotten a reply. I didn\u2019t want Nora to look\nback on pictures of her first birthday and see her father wasn\u2019t there and I\nfelt all the weight of the situation was rested on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d I said after a few moments of silence, my\neyes watching Nora as she got sick of the spoon and started using her hands. I\ncouldn\u2019t even worry about the mess she was making; her mess would be easy to\nclean up. \u201cHe made so much drama about being in her life and he visited so much\nand now he\u2019s just stopped. Something is wrong.\u201d My eyes flicked over to Harry\nwho looked as if he was thinking deeply into what I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tried Evie, that\u2019s all that matters. You\u2019ve given\nhim opportunities and he hasn\u2019t taken any of them. His mum has tried so don\u2019t\nblame yourself for his actions.\u201d Reaching across the table Harry took my hand\nand gave it a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>Shaking my head, I ran my fingers over the back of his hand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to hurt her.\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Both of our eyes flicked back over to Nora and instantly\nI smiled. This tiny human being that was all smiles and covered in yogurt was\nmy entire world and I didn\u2019t want anything to hurt even if she was at an age\nthat she wouldn\u2019t remember ever being sad. She smiled back up at me and giggled\nas she put a handful of yogurt into her mouth, pride evaporating off her as if\nshe were the smartest person in the room because of her actions. </p><p>She didn\u2019t deserve this. She deserved to have order in\nher life and because of Luke and all the emotions he was going through, she\nwasn\u2019t getting that. I had put all my feelings for Luke aside when she was born\nbecause I wanted what was best for her but sometimes it didn\u2019t even seem like\nLuke cared. He wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind to be a father and I felt\nhorrible for doing this to my little girl.</p><p>What Nora really deserved was to have Harry\u2019s name on her\nbirth certificate and not Luke\u2019s.</p>",

Liz\u2019s\neyes felt like hot pokers stabbing at my skin as I started pull the thin pages\nout. Liz\u2019s eyes were bad but Harry\u2019s felt like torture. My eyes flicked up to\nlook at him once the top of the pages was visible. His eyes were already\nwatering and his jaw was clenched tightly as he looked down at my shaking\nhands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d He whispered when he noticed I was\nlooking up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t care what this piece of paper says, I love you and\nNora so fucking much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I whispered, tilting my head back so I\ncould press a soft kiss to his lips.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Harry\u2019s lips ghosted over mine, fingers flexing around mine\nas he kissed me back lightly. Liz was still in the room so he couldn\u2019t kiss me\nas hard as I wanted him to but the smaller kisses he gave showed his love for\nme a thousand times stronger than his deeper, harder kisses. </p><p>Pulling away from him I took the tops of the pages back in\nmy hand and slowly edged them out of the envelope. Harry pressed small kisses\nagainst my forehead as I breathed out shakily. </p><p>Hurriedly I read over the words at the top of the page.\nWhatever they were, they were scientific and medical and meant more for Liz\nthen me and I skipped over them without a second thought. As I continued to\nread down the page I started to hyperventilate and I felt my heart hammer\nagainst my chest like a sharp beating drum. </p><p>Once my watery eyes find the information I want, my breath\ncatches in my throat and Harry tenses up completely beside me preparing himself\nfor bad news. A small sob left my mouth as I read the result and I quickly\nreached a hand up to cover my mouth.</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d Harry asked tensely as I continued to stare at the\nname that had 99.8% paternity written next to it. The paper was shaking with my\nhand and I had started to full on cry now. \u201cIs it Luke?\u201d Harry continued, his\nvoice the tightest I had ever heard it.</p><p>Snapping out of my shock I turned to look back up at Harry, my\neyes watering. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Harry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I whispered, voice cracking. </p><p>Seeing that Nora was Luke\u2019s hurt but not nearly as much as\nit hurt to watch the last fraction of hope flicker from Harry\u2019s confident green\neyes. He had been by me every step of the way, he had felt her kicks, been there\nfor her ultrasounds, he had been there for everything and I could tell that he\nhad really felt she was his.</p><p>Harry dropped his head forward and rested it on my shoulder.\nFrom the corner of my eye I watched Liz leave the room as I reached my hand up\nto it into Harry\u2019s hair, pepper soft kisses against his forehead that mixed\nwith the salty taste of my tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I said again, my hand tugging at his hair\ngently.</p><p>I truly was. He didn\u2019t deserve this, after everything he did\nfor the both of us, he deserved to have the higher percentage printed next to\nhis name, not Luke.</p><p>Harry breathed in deeply and at the same time I felt a tear\ndrop soak the material of my t-shirt. I felt the soft caress of his hand move\nover my belly and I felt more tears slide over my cheek with how gentle he was\ncaressing me.</p><p>Pulling back, he looked up at me with a heavy sigh, his chin\nresting on my shoulder. \u201cStill love you, both of you. Still my little girl, she\nis.\u201d His fingers scratched over my belly as he forced a sad smile on to his\nface. </p><p>A smile grew across my cheeks and I tugged him towards me so\nI could press a quick kiss to my lips. \u201cCan already tell she loves you. Every\nconcert I could feel her moving around, almost like she was dancing to the\nsound of your voice.\u201d </p><p>Harry bit his lip and finally I saw a flash of genuine\nhappiness in his eyes. He had said that the piece of paper didn\u2019t matter and I\ndidn\u2019t real get what he meant till now. Nora reacted to him, she liked the\nsound of his voice, her movements told me that the sound of his voice comforted\nher and made her feel safe despite Harry not being her biological father.</p><p>\u201cMy baby girl.\u201d He whispered, the warmth of his hand still\non my belly, right where Nora was staring to kick.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Liz had to take a deep breath as she shut the door to her\noffice. She had genuinely started to believe that Harry was going to be Nora\u2019s\ndad and the broken way that Evie had apologised to him broke her heart. </p><p>She didn\u2019t have kids herself, instead she a had a very\nstrong connection to the most special delivers that she did and Evangeline\nJones was her first and most special of them all. Oliver was not only her ex\u2019s\nbest friend but he was also hers and through him she met Nora and Nora was\nsomeone she could go to for absolutely everything. </p><p>She cried for a week after their death because she just\ncouldn\u2019t believe that two of the most important amazing people in her life were\ngone in seconds. A snap of gods fingers or something like that. Gone. Now she\ncouldn\u2019t see how their equally amazing daughter was getting completely fucked\nover by some douche that didn\u2019t deserve her or the little girl she carried.</p><p>The last thing she wanted to be doing right now was to be\ncalling said douche but she knew it was better for her to do it then Evie.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d A deep voice answers after only a few rings. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLuke, it\u2019s Dr May. How are you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Luke cleared his throat and she could hear him tell\nsomeone he would be back. \u201cI\u2019m great, how are you? Did the results come back?\u201d</p><p>Liz swallowed, she didn\u2019t want to do this and for a small\nsecond, she thought about lying before deciding against it. \u201cI\u2019m doing well.\nThe results did come back and congratulations you\u2019re going to be a dad.\u201d She\nwanted to add a resentful \u2018again\u2019 to the end but decided against it one more\ntime.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s, she\u2019s mine.\u201d He stuttered out.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is yours. Is there anything you want to know?\u201d If\nshe weren\u2019t a professional Doctor she would have already hung up on him.</p><p>\u201cYes, when\u2019s Evie\u2019s next appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my understanding of the current restraining order and\ncustody agreement between you and Evie, the only information I can give you is\nabout your daughters health. In that regards she is okay, growing very\nhealthily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, are you saying I can\u2019t go to any of the natal\nappointments for my daughter?\u201d Liz could sense that Luke was getting very angry\non the other end of the phone and was very glad that Evie didn\u2019t have to deal\nwith this.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have anything to do with Evie until the baby is\nborn. This is because of a health risk to both Evie and the baby, like I said I\ncan tell you anything you want to about the baby\u2019s health but you can\u2019t\ninteract with Evie at all.\u201d Luke could have seriously hurt both Evie and Nora\nthat day in the hospital and she had to roll her eyes at his obliviousness to\nnot realising his distance was for the health of his daughter.</p><p>\u201cSo, I won\u2019t be able to be there for her birth either.\u201d This\ntime Luke sounded defeated and he felt defeated as well. He already knew he\nwasn\u2019t going to be able to see his daughter\u2019s entry into the world. </p><p>\u201cLondon Hospital only allows two family or friends in the\nroom at the time of the birth, which is Grace and,\u201d she hesitated before saying\nthe next name. </p><p>Luke already knew and he rolled his eyes, resisting the urge\nto swear loudly and vent all his frustrations. He couldn\u2019t even do that because\nCarly was trying to sleep in the other room and he didn\u2019t want to disturb her. </p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. Fuck Luke really\ndid hate him and the thing he hated most was that he was good to Evie. He was\nthe type of good that Evie needed but he could never give her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liz slowly replied. \u201cIf you want to be there, you\ncould talk to you lawy,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupted. If he wanted to stay in good terms\nwith Evie he needed to keep her happy and if Harry did that he wasn\u2019t going to\ntry and kick him out of the room when Evie was at her most vulnerable and he definitely\ncouldn\u2019t kick Grace out either. \u201cIf that\u2019s what Evie wants. Can you call me\nafter all her appointments or if something happens?\u201d </p><p>Luke\u2019s mind jumped back to see Evie in the hospital bed. She\nhad looked so scared and tired in that bed, then she was hooked up to so many\ndifferent machines that he knew there was something wrong with his baby and that\nscared him half to death. He didn\u2019t want her to end up back there. </p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Liz felt the smallest bit of sympathy for Luke then\nbut it quickly vanished when he remembered the shattered look on Evie and\nHarry\u2019s face not even an hour ago.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry whispered, hand carding through my hair. \u201cI\ncalled Luke. He\u2019s already here at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d my voice cracked and I forced my eyes open to look\nat him.</p><p>Harry was sat at the side of my bed and when my eyes\ngroggily opened he offered me a soft smile fingers messaging my scalp. I felt\ntired and so sore, I was desperate for a hug from him but even the thought of\nhim touching me anywhere hurt. </p><p>\u201cLuke, I called him to tell him you were in labour and he\nsaid that he was already here with Carly. Their little boy was born yesterday.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201c\u2019s not fair.\u201d I slurred, reaching a hand up and dropping it\nover his. My hold was light and Harry frowned at it. Whether he was upset at my\nhold or the entire situation we were in I don\u2019t know and I was too tired to\nthink about it. </p><p>Harry shook his head and pulled my hand down to press a kiss\nagainst the back of it, careful to avoid hitting the IV. \u201cI know but we can\nmake the most of it. We\u2019re married now. She\u2019ll still have my name and I\u2019ll be\nher guardian. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext one is yours.\u201d I smiled up at him, fighting to keep my\neyes open. </p><p>Harry chuckled quickly and pressed another kiss to the back\nof my hand. \u201cI hope so. You\u2019re stuck with me now Mrs Styles. Go back to sleep\nbaby.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHm, you\u2019re so perfect.\u201d Harry said to Nora who was bundled\nup in his arms, wrapped tight in a pink fluffy blanket that Gemma had gotten\nher.</p><p>I was beyond tired and ready to go to sleep but Luke still\nhadn\u2019t been in yet to see Nora and I wanted to be awake when he did. She was\nborn only an hour ago and I already had to pass her over to someone else. It\nhurt my heart, I wanted to cry but I was to tired to even do that.</p><p>\u201cI can tell Luke we need a few more hours.\u201d Harry said,\ndrawing my eyes from the little brown curls on Nora\u2019s head up to his green\neyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I shifted a bit so I could curl around the\nwarmth of Harry\u2019s back. He shifted Nora into one arm and reached back a hand to\nsoothe it over my arm. \u201cWant to get it over with so I can go back to sleep.\nAnne and Gemma don\u2019t want to wait any longer either.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips pulled up into a slight smile as he tugged the soft\nblanket up higher and tucked it around my neck. He had to be just as tired but\nhe was soldiering on through it being the strong one out of the pair of us. A\nquick knock on the door caused me to jump and my heart beat picked up quickly\nand I was starting to feel sick.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to let him in?\u201d Harry asked carefully, his\narm tightening protectively around Nora. </p><p>I nodded at him and gave a final look at my little girl\nbefore Harry stood up and headed towards the door. My heart was still beating\nfast and I felt insanely nauseous. I hadn\u2019t felt this sick since my first\ntrimester. </p><p>Harry opened the door to Luke and I took in a deep breath to\nsettle everything that felt off inside me. Luke looked a little pale and his\nhands were shaking as he slowly made his way into my room behind Harry so we\nwere in the privacy of my room. Luke flicked his eyes up to Harry after staring\nat Nora, there was shock in his blue eyes. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to hold her?\u201d Harry asked Luke after a minute\nwhen he didn\u2019t do anything. </p><p>I thought Luke would come in annoyed that Harry got to hold his\ndaughter before he did but no, he was stood there like a deer in headlights not\nbeing able to decide who to look at. Luke nodded nervously and reached out his\narms and very gingerly Harry transferred Nora over as I held on to a deep\nbreath watching the interaction. </p><p>Nora fussed a little at the transfer but quickly settled\ninto her dad\u2019s arms as he tucked her up close to his chest. Harry swallowed\ndeeply as he stepped backwards until he was sat back on the bed with me, his\nhand quickly finding mine, shaky fingers linking together.</p><p>Luke was quite for a moment, just admiring his little girl,\nfinger stroking over her features before looking back up to me with tear coated\neyes. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful Eve\u2019s. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I croaked out. \u201cTired and sore but okay.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes hadn\u2019t even passed and already I was desperate\nto have her back in my arms. I missed the warmth her little body gave me when I\nheld her, even the smell of her and right now she felt too far away and out of\nmy reach. Having Harry close really did help. I couldn\u2019t imagine how I would be\nable to get through this without him here.</p><p>Luke nodded as he sat down in the chair that only recently\nhad Grace in it. He cooed down at Nora and I heard her gurgle back up at him\nand my heart stuttered. This was going to be very difficult for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Harry leant over me, his voice dropping low so\nonly I could hear him. \u201cJust breathe, he\u2019ll be gone in half hour and you\u2019ll be\nholding her again.\u201d</p><p>I nodded up at him, my hand tightening around his as I kept\nmy mouth shut on what I really wanted to say. Every moment Luke held her made\nme feel like I was losing a bit of her love and even though it was selfish I\ndidn\u2019t care. I wanted to have the little perfect bundle all to myself.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought of any names?\u201d Luke interrupted the\nsilence of the room. </p><p>Harry drew back from me with a tense look. Luke didn\u2019t know\nI had already named her Nora, he also didn\u2019t know that Harry and I were married\nand that I had changed my last name.</p><p>\u201cNora. We wanted Nora Anne, after Harry\u2019s mum, but I\nunderstand why you wouldn\u2019t want Anne but I really need her name to be Nora.\u201d\nMy voice cracked and I felt myself start to cry. I had my heart set on Nora and\nI wasn\u2019t going to budge.</p><p>Luke sniffed and nodded at me. \u201cWhat about her last name?\nThat time at lunch, you said you wanted her to have yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hyphen it with yours. Styles-Williams.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyebrows furrowed and that seemed to be the first\ntime that he forgot about the baby in his arms. \u201cYour last name, not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyles is my last name. We got married a few weeks ago.\u201d I\nmumbled the words quietly but somehow Luke still heard me.</p><p>Luke cursed underneath his breath, running a hand over his\nface quickly. I could tell that this wasn\u2019t something he expected to hear but I\nwas happy that seemed to be the worst part of his reaction. The room was quiet\nfor a few seconds, the only sound coming from the monitor I still had attached\nto my finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with Nora, I understand how important that is to\nyou, I don\u2019t think I can do anything about the last name. Maybe not the middle\nname.\u201d Luke concentrated back down at Nora and the room was bathed back in\nawkward silence.</p><p>I could fight to get the middle name for Harry but not now.\nI was too tired and I wasn\u2019t going to fight in front of Nora, even when she was\nthis young.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><b>Six months later:</b></p><p>\u201cDo not throw up on me.\u201d Harry said intently to Nora who was\nsupposed to be having tummy time on the floor but was instead lying on Harry\u2019s\nchest who was lying on the living room floor amongst all her toys.</p><p>Nora\u2019s lips pulled up into a toothy smile and Harry smiled\nback at her despite how tense he was being with her only a few seconds ago. Shaking\nmy head, I smirked down at the two of them over the top of the manuscript I was\nslowly making my way through. Harry and Nora made for great distractions.</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it was your own fault for burping her\nwithout a towel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Gucci,\u201d he complained and quickly put his hand up to\nstop her from rolling off his chest. </p><p>A small chuckle passed my lips and Harry glared up at me\nbeneath his long lashes. The dry cleaner got the stain out of the shirt so he\ndidn\u2019t have a reason to be bitter about the shirt anymore. </p><p>The little family moment we were having was quickly\ninterrupted by a sharp knock at the door. Harry looked towards the door at the\nsame time I did but not before he bought his hands up to drop them over Nora\u2019s\nback as her smile quickly fell and she tried to snuggle into his chest.</p><p>Throwing the manuscript down onto the couch next to me I\nquickly hurried to the front door while Harry started to soothe Nora because\nthe loud knocking was quickly unsettling her.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d Luke was stood at the door, looking very frazzled\nand his hair had been ruffled up a lot as well. \u201cWhat the hell. I told you to\ntext before coming around.\u201d</p><p>Luke pushed past me into the house, shaking his head\nquickly. \u201cI know but I need to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke she won\u2019t go to you when you\u2019re like this.\u201d Hurriedly\nI followed behind him to where Harry was standing with Nora clutched\nprotectively to his chest.</p><p>I had adapted to Luke being around so often again. The\ncustody agreement was for one, three-hour visit a week but he was around three\ntimes a week to see Nora and I didn\u2019t mind it. He was being a father and that\u2019s\nall I wanted him to do. </p><p>When he came around like this, fuming and without any\nwarning it was always a mess. Nora never wanted to go to him and she would just\nscream until she was blue in the face and back cradled in my arms.</p><p>\u201cGive me my daughter Harry.\u201d Luke seethed but Harry didn\u2019t\nflinch.</p><p>\u201cCalm down first.\u201d Harry said evenly, hand gentle on Nora\u2019s\nback. </p><p>My heart started to race as Luke\u2019s anger grew tenfold. Nora\ncould sense his feelings and she started to cry into Harry\u2019s neck despite how\nmuch he attempted to soothe her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to calm down she\u2019s my fucking daughter and I\nwant to hold her.\u201d Luke\u2019s hands came up and grabbed Nora around her sides\ntrying to pull her back from Harry\u2019s tight hold.</p><p>That was when I saw red and I shot myself across the room as\nquickly as possible to put myself between Luke and Nora. I didn\u2019t care what was\ngoing on with him today, not that he ever told me what the problem was these\ndays, but I wasn\u2019t going to have him vent out all his issues with Nora so\nclose.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that I don\u2019t care how\noften you come around to see her but you cannot see her when you\u2019re this angry.\nIf you want to hold her today go outside and calm down first.\u201d</p><p>Luke scowled at me. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep her from me Evie.\u201d</p><p>Turning he stormed back out of the house, slamming the front\ndoor which caused me to flinch. Lifting a hand up I ran out over my face, my\nchest shaking with my heavy breathes as I heard the sound of tyres screeching\nout of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry said softly and Nora\u2019s loud cries drew me back\nto reality. Putting my hands up I tried to take her but Harry shook his head at\nme as well. \u201cYou need to calm down. You need to calm her down and you can\u2019t do\nthat when you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>I took a few deep breathes and tried to shut my mind off\nfrom what just happened and once Harry was satisfied he passed Nora over to me.\nI cuddled her tight to my chest, pressing small kisses against the side of her\nhead as I stepped back to be sat down on the couch. Harry followed, wrapping\nthe both of us up in his strong arms as he settled next to us.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t come around when he\u2019s like that. He could have\nhurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered into Nora\u2019s hair.</p><p>She was very slowly starting to calm down but Harry was\nright. Luke took it one step to far, he could have really hurt her by taking\nher from Harry like he did but he didn\u2019t even care. Whatever was happening in\nhis life made him blind to the safety of his daughter.</p><p><b>Eleven Months:</b></p><p>My finger slid over my phone as if I kept looking at it I\nwould magically receive a text from Luke. This wasn\u2019t like him. I hadn\u2019t seen\nhim in two weeks. Nora didn\u2019t seem fazed at all by the lack of visits but it\nwas confusing me that Luke suddenly went from two visits a week to not showing\nup or even texting me back to see what was happening.</p><p>\u201cStill nothing?\u201d Harry asked, watching Nora with furrowed\nbrows as she spooned her yogurt anywhere but into her mouth. It was dripping\ndown her face onto her bib and coated her cheeks but she refused to let Harry\nhelp her. </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I sighed dropping my phone down to the table.\nLeaning over I tried to take the spoon from Nora so she at least managed to get\nsome food into her but she squealed and turned away from me as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told him and you\u2019ve told his mum. You can\u2019t do\nanything more Evie, he needs to make the effort.\u201d Harry picked up his own spoon\nfrom his bowl of cereal, eyes soft as he looked over at me.</p><p>I hummed resting my chin in my hands as I rested my\nelbows on the table. I wasn\u2019t interested in my breakfast anymore, I felt to\nworried. Harry was right, I didn\u2019t need to be worrying over this, I had done\neverything I could have. Nora\u2019s first birthday was soon and I had invited Luke\nto come to her party but I hadn\u2019t gotten a reply. I didn\u2019t want Nora to look\nback on pictures of her first birthday and see her father wasn\u2019t there and I\nfelt all the weight of the situation was rested on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d I said after a few moments of silence, my\neyes watching Nora as she got sick of the spoon and started using her hands. I\ncouldn\u2019t even worry about the mess she was making; her mess would be easy to\nclean up. \u201cHe made so much drama about being in her life and he visited so much\nand now he\u2019s just stopped. Something is wrong.\u201d My eyes flicked over to Harry\nwho looked as if he was thinking deeply into what I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tried Evie, that\u2019s all that matters. You\u2019ve given\nhim opportunities and he hasn\u2019t taken any of them. His mum has tried so don\u2019t\nblame yourself for his actions.\u201d Reaching across the table Harry took my hand\nand gave it a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>Shaking my head, I ran my fingers over the back of his hand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to hurt her.\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Both of our eyes flicked back over to Nora and instantly\nI smiled. This tiny human being that was all smiles and covered in yogurt was\nmy entire world and I didn\u2019t want anything to hurt even if she was at an age\nthat she wouldn\u2019t remember ever being sad. She smiled back up at me and giggled\nas she put a handful of yogurt into her mouth, pride evaporating off her as if\nshe were the smartest person in the room because of her actions. </p><p>She didn\u2019t deserve this. She deserved to have order in\nher life and because of Luke and all the emotions he was going through, she\nwasn\u2019t getting that. I had put all my feelings for Luke aside when she was born\nbecause I wanted what was best for her but sometimes it didn\u2019t even seem like\nLuke cared. He wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind to be a father and I felt\nhorrible for doing this to my little girl.</p><p>What Nora really deserved was to have Harry\u2019s name on her\nbirth certificate and not Luke\u2019s.</p></p>",

I wasn\u2019t in a hurry to see it but I also wasn\u2019t\ntaking my time and prolonging it any longer then what it needed to be. Liz\u2019s\neyes felt like hot pokers stabbing at my skin as I started pull the thin pages\nout. Liz\u2019s eyes were bad but Harry\u2019s felt like torture. My eyes flicked up to\nlook at him once the top of the pages was visible. His eyes were already\nwatering and his jaw was clenched tightly as he looked down at my shaking\nhands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d He whispered when he noticed I was\nlooking up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t care what this piece of paper says, I love you and\nNora so fucking much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I whispered, tilting my head back so I\ncould press a soft kiss to his lips.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Harry\u2019s lips ghosted over mine, fingers flexing around mine\nas he kissed me back lightly. Liz was still in the room so he couldn\u2019t kiss me\nas hard as I wanted him to but the smaller kisses he gave showed his love for\nme a thousand times stronger than his deeper, harder kisses. </p><p>Pulling away from him I took the tops of the pages back in\nmy hand and slowly edged them out of the envelope. Harry pressed small kisses\nagainst my forehead as I breathed out shakily. </p><p>Hurriedly I read over the words at the top of the page.\nWhatever they were, they were scientific and medical and meant more for Liz\nthen me and I skipped over them without a second thought. As I continued to\nread down the page I started to hyperventilate and I felt my heart hammer\nagainst my chest like a sharp beating drum. </p><p>Once my watery eyes find the information I want, my breath\ncatches in my throat and Harry tenses up completely beside me preparing himself\nfor bad news. A small sob left my mouth as I read the result and I quickly\nreached a hand up to cover my mouth.</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d Harry asked tensely as I continued to stare at the\nname that had 99.8% paternity written next to it. The paper was shaking with my\nhand and I had started to full on cry now. \u201cIs it Luke?\u201d Harry continued, his\nvoice the tightest I had ever heard it.</p><p>Snapping out of my shock I turned to look back up at Harry, my\neyes watering. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Harry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I whispered, voice cracking. </p><p>Seeing that Nora was Luke\u2019s hurt but not nearly as much as\nit hurt to watch the last fraction of hope flicker from Harry\u2019s confident green\neyes. He had been by me every step of the way, he had felt her kicks, been there\nfor her ultrasounds, he had been there for everything and I could tell that he\nhad really felt she was his.</p><p>Harry dropped his head forward and rested it on my shoulder.\nFrom the corner of my eye I watched Liz leave the room as I reached my hand up\nto it into Harry\u2019s hair, pepper soft kisses against his forehead that mixed\nwith the salty taste of my tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I said again, my hand tugging at his hair\ngently.</p><p>I truly was. He didn\u2019t deserve this, after everything he did\nfor the both of us, he deserved to have the higher percentage printed next to\nhis name, not Luke.</p><p>Harry breathed in deeply and at the same time I felt a tear\ndrop soak the material of my t-shirt. I felt the soft caress of his hand move\nover my belly and I felt more tears slide over my cheek with how gentle he was\ncaressing me.</p><p>Pulling back, he looked up at me with a heavy sigh, his chin\nresting on my shoulder. \u201cStill love you, both of you. Still my little girl, she\nis.\u201d His fingers scratched over my belly as he forced a sad smile on to his\nface. </p><p>A smile grew across my cheeks and I tugged him towards me so\nI could press a quick kiss to my lips. \u201cCan already tell she loves you. Every\nconcert I could feel her moving around, almost like she was dancing to the\nsound of your voice.\u201d </p><p>Harry bit his lip and finally I saw a flash of genuine\nhappiness in his eyes. He had said that the piece of paper didn\u2019t matter and I\ndidn\u2019t real get what he meant till now. Nora reacted to him, she liked the\nsound of his voice, her movements told me that the sound of his voice comforted\nher and made her feel safe despite Harry not being her biological father.</p><p>\u201cMy baby girl.\u201d He whispered, the warmth of his hand still\non my belly, right where Nora was staring to kick.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Liz had to take a deep breath as she shut the door to her\noffice. She had genuinely started to believe that Harry was going to be Nora\u2019s\ndad and the broken way that Evie had apologised to him broke her heart. </p><p>She didn\u2019t have kids herself, instead she a had a very\nstrong connection to the most special delivers that she did and Evangeline\nJones was her first and most special of them all. Oliver was not only her ex\u2019s\nbest friend but he was also hers and through him she met Nora and Nora was\nsomeone she could go to for absolutely everything. </p><p>She cried for a week after their death because she just\ncouldn\u2019t believe that two of the most important amazing people in her life were\ngone in seconds. A snap of gods fingers or something like that. Gone. Now she\ncouldn\u2019t see how their equally amazing daughter was getting completely fucked\nover by some douche that didn\u2019t deserve her or the little girl she carried.</p><p>The last thing she wanted to be doing right now was to be\ncalling said douche but she knew it was better for her to do it then Evie.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d A deep voice answers after only a few rings. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLuke, it\u2019s Dr May. How are you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Luke cleared his throat and she could hear him tell\nsomeone he would be back. \u201cI\u2019m great, how are you? Did the results come back?\u201d</p><p>Liz swallowed, she didn\u2019t want to do this and for a small\nsecond, she thought about lying before deciding against it. \u201cI\u2019m doing well.\nThe results did come back and congratulations you\u2019re going to be a dad.\u201d She\nwanted to add a resentful \u2018again\u2019 to the end but decided against it one more\ntime.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s, she\u2019s mine.\u201d He stuttered out.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is yours. Is there anything you want to know?\u201d If\nshe weren\u2019t a professional Doctor she would have already hung up on him.</p><p>\u201cYes, when\u2019s Evie\u2019s next appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my understanding of the current restraining order and\ncustody agreement between you and Evie, the only information I can give you is\nabout your daughters health. In that regards she is okay, growing very\nhealthily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, are you saying I can\u2019t go to any of the natal\nappointments for my daughter?\u201d Liz could sense that Luke was getting very angry\non the other end of the phone and was very glad that Evie didn\u2019t have to deal\nwith this.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have anything to do with Evie until the baby is\nborn. This is because of a health risk to both Evie and the baby, like I said I\ncan tell you anything you want to about the baby\u2019s health but you can\u2019t\ninteract with Evie at all.\u201d Luke could have seriously hurt both Evie and Nora\nthat day in the hospital and she had to roll her eyes at his obliviousness to\nnot realising his distance was for the health of his daughter.</p><p>\u201cSo, I won\u2019t be able to be there for her birth either.\u201d This\ntime Luke sounded defeated and he felt defeated as well. He already knew he\nwasn\u2019t going to be able to see his daughter\u2019s entry into the world. </p><p>\u201cLondon Hospital only allows two family or friends in the\nroom at the time of the birth, which is Grace and,\u201d she hesitated before saying\nthe next name. </p><p>Luke already knew and he rolled his eyes, resisting the urge\nto swear loudly and vent all his frustrations. He couldn\u2019t even do that because\nCarly was trying to sleep in the other room and he didn\u2019t want to disturb her. </p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. Fuck Luke really\ndid hate him and the thing he hated most was that he was good to Evie. He was\nthe type of good that Evie needed but he could never give her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liz slowly replied. \u201cIf you want to be there, you\ncould talk to you lawy,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupted. If he wanted to stay in good terms\nwith Evie he needed to keep her happy and if Harry did that he wasn\u2019t going to\ntry and kick him out of the room when Evie was at her most vulnerable and he definitely\ncouldn\u2019t kick Grace out either. \u201cIf that\u2019s what Evie wants. Can you call me\nafter all her appointments or if something happens?\u201d </p><p>Luke\u2019s mind jumped back to see Evie in the hospital bed. She\nhad looked so scared and tired in that bed, then she was hooked up to so many\ndifferent machines that he knew there was something wrong with his baby and that\nscared him half to death. He didn\u2019t want her to end up back there. </p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Liz felt the smallest bit of sympathy for Luke then\nbut it quickly vanished when he remembered the shattered look on Evie and\nHarry\u2019s face not even an hour ago.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry whispered, hand carding through my hair. \u201cI\ncalled Luke. He\u2019s already here at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d my voice cracked and I forced my eyes open to look\nat him.</p><p>Harry was sat at the side of my bed and when my eyes\ngroggily opened he offered me a soft smile fingers messaging my scalp. I felt\ntired and so sore, I was desperate for a hug from him but even the thought of\nhim touching me anywhere hurt. </p><p>\u201cLuke, I called him to tell him you were in labour and he\nsaid that he was already here with Carly. Their little boy was born yesterday.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201c\u2019s not fair.\u201d I slurred, reaching a hand up and dropping it\nover his. My hold was light and Harry frowned at it. Whether he was upset at my\nhold or the entire situation we were in I don\u2019t know and I was too tired to\nthink about it. </p><p>Harry shook his head and pulled my hand down to press a kiss\nagainst the back of it, careful to avoid hitting the IV. \u201cI know but we can\nmake the most of it. We\u2019re married now. She\u2019ll still have my name and I\u2019ll be\nher guardian. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext one is yours.\u201d I smiled up at him, fighting to keep my\neyes open. </p><p>Harry chuckled quickly and pressed another kiss to the back\nof my hand. \u201cI hope so. You\u2019re stuck with me now Mrs Styles. Go back to sleep\nbaby.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHm, you\u2019re so perfect.\u201d Harry said to Nora who was bundled\nup in his arms, wrapped tight in a pink fluffy blanket that Gemma had gotten\nher.</p><p>I was beyond tired and ready to go to sleep but Luke still\nhadn\u2019t been in yet to see Nora and I wanted to be awake when he did. She was\nborn only an hour ago and I already had to pass her over to someone else. It\nhurt my heart, I wanted to cry but I was to tired to even do that.</p><p>\u201cI can tell Luke we need a few more hours.\u201d Harry said,\ndrawing my eyes from the little brown curls on Nora\u2019s head up to his green\neyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I shifted a bit so I could curl around the\nwarmth of Harry\u2019s back. He shifted Nora into one arm and reached back a hand to\nsoothe it over my arm. \u201cWant to get it over with so I can go back to sleep.\nAnne and Gemma don\u2019t want to wait any longer either.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips pulled up into a slight smile as he tugged the soft\nblanket up higher and tucked it around my neck. He had to be just as tired but\nhe was soldiering on through it being the strong one out of the pair of us. A\nquick knock on the door caused me to jump and my heart beat picked up quickly\nand I was starting to feel sick.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to let him in?\u201d Harry asked carefully, his\narm tightening protectively around Nora. </p><p>I nodded at him and gave a final look at my little girl\nbefore Harry stood up and headed towards the door. My heart was still beating\nfast and I felt insanely nauseous. I hadn\u2019t felt this sick since my first\ntrimester. </p><p>Harry opened the door to Luke and I took in a deep breath to\nsettle everything that felt off inside me. Luke looked a little pale and his\nhands were shaking as he slowly made his way into my room behind Harry so we\nwere in the privacy of my room. Luke flicked his eyes up to Harry after staring\nat Nora, there was shock in his blue eyes. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to hold her?\u201d Harry asked Luke after a minute\nwhen he didn\u2019t do anything. </p><p>I thought Luke would come in annoyed that Harry got to hold his\ndaughter before he did but no, he was stood there like a deer in headlights not\nbeing able to decide who to look at. Luke nodded nervously and reached out his\narms and very gingerly Harry transferred Nora over as I held on to a deep\nbreath watching the interaction. </p><p>Nora fussed a little at the transfer but quickly settled\ninto her dad\u2019s arms as he tucked her up close to his chest. Harry swallowed\ndeeply as he stepped backwards until he was sat back on the bed with me, his\nhand quickly finding mine, shaky fingers linking together.</p><p>Luke was quite for a moment, just admiring his little girl,\nfinger stroking over her features before looking back up to me with tear coated\neyes. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful Eve\u2019s. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I croaked out. \u201cTired and sore but okay.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes hadn\u2019t even passed and already I was desperate\nto have her back in my arms. I missed the warmth her little body gave me when I\nheld her, even the smell of her and right now she felt too far away and out of\nmy reach. Having Harry close really did help. I couldn\u2019t imagine how I would be\nable to get through this without him here.</p><p>Luke nodded as he sat down in the chair that only recently\nhad Grace in it. He cooed down at Nora and I heard her gurgle back up at him\nand my heart stuttered. This was going to be very difficult for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Harry leant over me, his voice dropping low so\nonly I could hear him. \u201cJust breathe, he\u2019ll be gone in half hour and you\u2019ll be\nholding her again.\u201d</p><p>I nodded up at him, my hand tightening around his as I kept\nmy mouth shut on what I really wanted to say. Every moment Luke held her made\nme feel like I was losing a bit of her love and even though it was selfish I\ndidn\u2019t care. I wanted to have the little perfect bundle all to myself.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought of any names?\u201d Luke interrupted the\nsilence of the room. </p><p>Harry drew back from me with a tense look. Luke didn\u2019t know\nI had already named her Nora, he also didn\u2019t know that Harry and I were married\nand that I had changed my last name.</p><p>\u201cNora. We wanted Nora Anne, after Harry\u2019s mum, but I\nunderstand why you wouldn\u2019t want Anne but I really need her name to be Nora.\u201d\nMy voice cracked and I felt myself start to cry. I had my heart set on Nora and\nI wasn\u2019t going to budge.</p><p>Luke sniffed and nodded at me. \u201cWhat about her last name?\nThat time at lunch, you said you wanted her to have yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hyphen it with yours. Styles-Williams.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyebrows furrowed and that seemed to be the first\ntime that he forgot about the baby in his arms. \u201cYour last name, not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyles is my last name. We got married a few weeks ago.\u201d I\nmumbled the words quietly but somehow Luke still heard me.</p><p>Luke cursed underneath his breath, running a hand over his\nface quickly. I could tell that this wasn\u2019t something he expected to hear but I\nwas happy that seemed to be the worst part of his reaction. The room was quiet\nfor a few seconds, the only sound coming from the monitor I still had attached\nto my finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with Nora, I understand how important that is to\nyou, I don\u2019t think I can do anything about the last name. Maybe not the middle\nname.\u201d Luke concentrated back down at Nora and the room was bathed back in\nawkward silence.</p><p>I could fight to get the middle name for Harry but not now.\nI was too tired and I wasn\u2019t going to fight in front of Nora, even when she was\nthis young.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><b>Six months later:</b></p><p>\u201cDo not throw up on me.\u201d Harry said intently to Nora who was\nsupposed to be having tummy time on the floor but was instead lying on Harry\u2019s\nchest who was lying on the living room floor amongst all her toys.</p><p>Nora\u2019s lips pulled up into a toothy smile and Harry smiled\nback at her despite how tense he was being with her only a few seconds ago. Shaking\nmy head, I smirked down at the two of them over the top of the manuscript I was\nslowly making my way through. Harry and Nora made for great distractions.</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it was your own fault for burping her\nwithout a towel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Gucci,\u201d he complained and quickly put his hand up to\nstop her from rolling off his chest. </p><p>A small chuckle passed my lips and Harry glared up at me\nbeneath his long lashes. The dry cleaner got the stain out of the shirt so he\ndidn\u2019t have a reason to be bitter about the shirt anymore. </p><p>The little family moment we were having was quickly\ninterrupted by a sharp knock at the door. Harry looked towards the door at the\nsame time I did but not before he bought his hands up to drop them over Nora\u2019s\nback as her smile quickly fell and she tried to snuggle into his chest.</p><p>Throwing the manuscript down onto the couch next to me I\nquickly hurried to the front door while Harry started to soothe Nora because\nthe loud knocking was quickly unsettling her.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d Luke was stood at the door, looking very frazzled\nand his hair had been ruffled up a lot as well. \u201cWhat the hell. I told you to\ntext before coming around.\u201d</p><p>Luke pushed past me into the house, shaking his head\nquickly. \u201cI know but I need to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke she won\u2019t go to you when you\u2019re like this.\u201d Hurriedly\nI followed behind him to where Harry was standing with Nora clutched\nprotectively to his chest.</p><p>I had adapted to Luke being around so often again. The\ncustody agreement was for one, three-hour visit a week but he was around three\ntimes a week to see Nora and I didn\u2019t mind it. He was being a father and that\u2019s\nall I wanted him to do. </p><p>When he came around like this, fuming and without any\nwarning it was always a mess. Nora never wanted to go to him and she would just\nscream until she was blue in the face and back cradled in my arms.</p><p>\u201cGive me my daughter Harry.\u201d Luke seethed but Harry didn\u2019t\nflinch.</p><p>\u201cCalm down first.\u201d Harry said evenly, hand gentle on Nora\u2019s\nback. </p><p>My heart started to race as Luke\u2019s anger grew tenfold. Nora\ncould sense his feelings and she started to cry into Harry\u2019s neck despite how\nmuch he attempted to soothe her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to calm down she\u2019s my fucking daughter and I\nwant to hold her.\u201d Luke\u2019s hands came up and grabbed Nora around her sides\ntrying to pull her back from Harry\u2019s tight hold.</p><p>That was when I saw red and I shot myself across the room as\nquickly as possible to put myself between Luke and Nora. I didn\u2019t care what was\ngoing on with him today, not that he ever told me what the problem was these\ndays, but I wasn\u2019t going to have him vent out all his issues with Nora so\nclose.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that I don\u2019t care how\noften you come around to see her but you cannot see her when you\u2019re this angry.\nIf you want to hold her today go outside and calm down first.\u201d</p><p>Luke scowled at me. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep her from me Evie.\u201d</p><p>Turning he stormed back out of the house, slamming the front\ndoor which caused me to flinch. Lifting a hand up I ran out over my face, my\nchest shaking with my heavy breathes as I heard the sound of tyres screeching\nout of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry said softly and Nora\u2019s loud cries drew me back\nto reality. Putting my hands up I tried to take her but Harry shook his head at\nme as well. \u201cYou need to calm down. You need to calm her down and you can\u2019t do\nthat when you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>I took a few deep breathes and tried to shut my mind off\nfrom what just happened and once Harry was satisfied he passed Nora over to me.\nI cuddled her tight to my chest, pressing small kisses against the side of her\nhead as I stepped back to be sat down on the couch. Harry followed, wrapping\nthe both of us up in his strong arms as he settled next to us.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t come around when he\u2019s like that. He could have\nhurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered into Nora\u2019s hair.</p><p>She was very slowly starting to calm down but Harry was\nright. Luke took it one step to far, he could have really hurt her by taking\nher from Harry like he did but he didn\u2019t even care. Whatever was happening in\nhis life made him blind to the safety of his daughter.</p><p><b>Eleven Months:</b></p><p>My finger slid over my phone as if I kept looking at it I\nwould magically receive a text from Luke. This wasn\u2019t like him. I hadn\u2019t seen\nhim in two weeks. Nora didn\u2019t seem fazed at all by the lack of visits but it\nwas confusing me that Luke suddenly went from two visits a week to not showing\nup or even texting me back to see what was happening.</p><p>\u201cStill nothing?\u201d Harry asked, watching Nora with furrowed\nbrows as she spooned her yogurt anywhere but into her mouth. It was dripping\ndown her face onto her bib and coated her cheeks but she refused to let Harry\nhelp her. </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I sighed dropping my phone down to the table.\nLeaning over I tried to take the spoon from Nora so she at least managed to get\nsome food into her but she squealed and turned away from me as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told him and you\u2019ve told his mum. You can\u2019t do\nanything more Evie, he needs to make the effort.\u201d Harry picked up his own spoon\nfrom his bowl of cereal, eyes soft as he looked over at me.</p><p>I hummed resting my chin in my hands as I rested my\nelbows on the table. I wasn\u2019t interested in my breakfast anymore, I felt to\nworried. Harry was right, I didn\u2019t need to be worrying over this, I had done\neverything I could have. Nora\u2019s first birthday was soon and I had invited Luke\nto come to her party but I hadn\u2019t gotten a reply. I didn\u2019t want Nora to look\nback on pictures of her first birthday and see her father wasn\u2019t there and I\nfelt all the weight of the situation was rested on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d I said after a few moments of silence, my\neyes watching Nora as she got sick of the spoon and started using her hands. I\ncouldn\u2019t even worry about the mess she was making; her mess would be easy to\nclean up. \u201cHe made so much drama about being in her life and he visited so much\nand now he\u2019s just stopped. Something is wrong.\u201d My eyes flicked over to Harry\nwho looked as if he was thinking deeply into what I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tried Evie, that\u2019s all that matters. You\u2019ve given\nhim opportunities and he hasn\u2019t taken any of them. His mum has tried so don\u2019t\nblame yourself for his actions.\u201d Reaching across the table Harry took my hand\nand gave it a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>Shaking my head, I ran my fingers over the back of his hand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to hurt her.\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Both of our eyes flicked back over to Nora and instantly\nI smiled. This tiny human being that was all smiles and covered in yogurt was\nmy entire world and I didn\u2019t want anything to hurt even if she was at an age\nthat she wouldn\u2019t remember ever being sad. She smiled back up at me and giggled\nas she put a handful of yogurt into her mouth, pride evaporating off her as if\nshe were the smartest person in the room because of her actions. </p><p>She didn\u2019t deserve this. She deserved to have order in\nher life and because of Luke and all the emotions he was going through, she\nwasn\u2019t getting that. I had put all my feelings for Luke aside when she was born\nbecause I wanted what was best for her but sometimes it didn\u2019t even seem like\nLuke cared. He wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind to be a father and I felt\nhorrible for doing this to my little girl.</p><p>What Nora really deserved was to have Harry\u2019s name on her\nbirth certificate and not Luke\u2019s.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>Little Love: Luke</h2><p><b>Part 1:</b></p><p>An au of my fic&nbsp;<a href=\"http://harrysofluffy.tumblr.com/post/177162800424/chapter-ten-birth-with-thanks-to-beta-writer\">&lsquo;Little Love&rsquo;</a>&nbsp;</p><p><b>words 4.5k - first/second person</b></p><p><b>.-.-.-.</b></p><p>Slowly I slipped my finger beneath the tab, pulling it open\nslowly as I breathed out. I wasn&rsquo;t in a hurry to see it but I also wasn&rsquo;t\ntaking my time and prolonging it any longer then what it needed to be. Liz&rsquo;s\neyes felt like hot pokers stabbing at my skin as I started pull the thin pages\nout. Liz&rsquo;s eyes were bad but Harry&rsquo;s felt like torture. My eyes flicked up to\nlook at him once the top of the pages was visible. His eyes were already\nwatering and his jaw was clenched tightly as he looked down at my shaking\nhands.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo; He whispered when he noticed I was\nlooking up at him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what this piece of paper says, I love you and\nNora so fucking much it hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; I whispered, tilting my head back so I\ncould press a soft kiss to his lips.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s lips ghosted over mine, fingers flexing around mine\nas he kissed me back lightly. Liz was still in the room so he couldn&rsquo;t kiss me\nas hard as I wanted him to but the smaller kisses he gave showed his love for\nme a thousand times stronger than his deeper, harder kisses. </p><p>Pulling away from him I took the tops of the pages back in\nmy hand and slowly edged them out of the envelope. Harry pressed small kisses\nagainst my forehead as I breathed out shakily. </p><p>Hurriedly I read over the words at the top of the page.\nWhatever they were, they were scientific and medical and meant more for Liz\nthen me and I skipped over them without a second thought. As I continued to\nread down the page I started to hyperventilate and I felt my heart hammer\nagainst my chest like a sharp beating drum. </p><p>Once my watery eyes find the information I want, my breath\ncatches in my throat and Harry tenses up completely beside me preparing himself\nfor bad news. A small sob left my mouth as I read the result and I quickly\nreached a hand up to cover my mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Evie?&rdquo; Harry asked tensely as I continued to stare at the\nname that had 99.8% paternity written next to it. The paper was shaking with my\nhand and I had started to full on cry now. &ldquo;Is it Luke?&rdquo; Harry continued, his\nvoice the tightest I had ever heard it.</p><p>Snapping out of my shock I turned to look back up at Harry, my\neyes watering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Harry. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; I whispered, voice cracking. </p><p>Seeing that Nora was Luke&rsquo;s hurt but not nearly as much as\nit hurt to watch the last fraction of hope flicker from Harry&rsquo;s confident green\neyes. He had been by me every step of the way, he had felt her kicks, been there\nfor her ultrasounds, he had been there for everything and I could tell that he\nhad really felt she was his.</p><p>Harry dropped his head forward and rested it on my shoulder.\nFrom the corner of my eye I watched Liz leave the room as I reached my hand up\nto it into Harry&rsquo;s hair, pepper soft kisses against his forehead that mixed\nwith the salty taste of my tears.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; I said again, my hand tugging at his hair\ngently.</p><p>I truly was. He didn&rsquo;t deserve this, after everything he did\nfor the both of us, he deserved to have the higher percentage printed next to\nhis name, not Luke.</p><p>Harry breathed in deeply and at the same time I felt a tear\ndrop soak the material of my t-shirt. I felt the soft caress of his hand move\nover my belly and I felt more tears slide over my cheek with how gentle he was\ncaressing me.</p><p>Pulling back, he looked up at me with a heavy sigh, his chin\nresting on my shoulder. &ldquo;Still love you, both of you. Still my little girl, she\nis.&rdquo; His fingers scratched over my belly as he forced a sad smile on to his\nface. </p><p>A smile grew across my cheeks and I tugged him towards me so\nI could press a quick kiss to my lips. &ldquo;Can already tell she loves you. Every\nconcert I could feel her moving around, almost like she was dancing to the\nsound of your voice.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry bit his lip and finally I saw a flash of genuine\nhappiness in his eyes. He had said that the piece of paper didn&rsquo;t matter and I\ndidn&rsquo;t real get what he meant till now. Nora reacted to him, she liked the\nsound of his voice, her movements told me that the sound of his voice comforted\nher and made her feel safe despite Harry not being her biological father.</p><p>&ldquo;My baby girl.&rdquo; He whispered, the warmth of his hand still\non my belly, right where Nora was staring to kick.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Liz had to take a deep breath as she shut the door to her\noffice. She had genuinely started to believe that Harry was going to be Nora&rsquo;s\ndad and the broken way that Evie had apologised to him broke her heart. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t have kids herself, instead she a had a very\nstrong connection to the most special delivers that she did and Evangeline\nJones was her first and most special of them all. Oliver was not only her ex&rsquo;s\nbest friend but he was also hers and through him she met Nora and Nora was\nsomeone she could go to for absolutely everything. </p><p>She cried for a week after their death because she just\ncouldn&rsquo;t believe that two of the most important amazing people in her life were\ngone in seconds. A snap of gods fingers or something like that. Gone. Now she\ncouldn&rsquo;t see how their equally amazing daughter was getting completely fucked\nover by some douche that didn&rsquo;t deserve her or the little girl she carried.</p><p>The last thing she wanted to be doing right now was to be\ncalling said douche but she knew it was better for her to do it then Evie.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; A deep voice answers after only a few rings. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Luke, it&rsquo;s Dr May. How are you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Luke cleared his throat and she could hear him tell\nsomeone he would be back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m great, how are you? Did the results come back?&rdquo;</p><p>Liz swallowed, she didn&rsquo;t want to do this and for a small\nsecond, she thought about lying before deciding against it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing well.\nThe results did come back and congratulations you&rsquo;re going to be a dad.&rdquo; She\nwanted to add a resentful &lsquo;again&rsquo; to the end but decided against it one more\ntime.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; He stuttered out.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she is yours. Is there anything you want to know?&rdquo; If\nshe weren&rsquo;t a professional Doctor she would have already hung up on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, when&rsquo;s Evie&rsquo;s next appointment?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From my understanding of the current restraining order and\ncustody agreement between you and Evie, the only information I can give you is\nabout your daughters health. In that regards she is okay, growing very\nhealthily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, are you saying I can&rsquo;t go to any of the natal\nappointments for my daughter?&rdquo; Liz could sense that Luke was getting very angry\non the other end of the phone and was very glad that Evie didn&rsquo;t have to deal\nwith this.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have anything to do with Evie until the baby is\nborn. This is because of a health risk to both Evie and the baby, like I said I\ncan tell you anything you want to about the baby&rsquo;s health but you can&rsquo;t\ninteract with Evie at all.&rdquo; Luke could have seriously hurt both Evie and Nora\nthat day in the hospital and she had to roll her eyes at his obliviousness to\nnot realising his distance was for the health of his daughter.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I won&rsquo;t be able to be there for her birth either.&rdquo; This\ntime Luke sounded defeated and he felt defeated as well. He already knew he\nwasn&rsquo;t going to be able to see his daughter&rsquo;s entry into the world. </p><p>&ldquo;London Hospital only allows two family or friends in the\nroom at the time of the birth, which is Grace and,&rdquo; she hesitated before saying\nthe next name. </p><p>Luke already knew and he rolled his eyes, resisting the urge\nto swear loudly and vent all his frustrations. He couldn&rsquo;t even do that because\nCarly was trying to sleep in the other room and he didn&rsquo;t want to disturb her. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; he said through clenched teeth. Fuck Luke really\ndid hate him and the thing he hated most was that he was good to Evie. He was\nthe type of good that Evie needed but he could never give her.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Liz slowly replied. &ldquo;If you want to be there, you\ncould talk to you lawy,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he interrupted. If he wanted to stay in good terms\nwith Evie he needed to keep her happy and if Harry did that he wasn&rsquo;t going to\ntry and kick him out of the room when Evie was at her most vulnerable and he definitely\ncouldn&rsquo;t kick Grace out either. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what Evie wants. Can you call me\nafter all her appointments or if something happens?&rdquo; </p><p>Luke&rsquo;s mind jumped back to see Evie in the hospital bed. She\nhad looked so scared and tired in that bed, then she was hooked up to so many\ndifferent machines that he knew there was something wrong with his baby and that\nscared him half to death. He didn&rsquo;t want her to end up back there. </p><p>&ldquo;I can.&rdquo; Liz felt the smallest bit of sympathy for Luke then\nbut it quickly vanished when he remembered the shattered look on Evie and\nHarry&rsquo;s face not even an hour ago.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Harry whispered, hand carding through my hair. &ldquo;I\ncalled Luke. He&rsquo;s already here at the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; my voice cracked and I forced my eyes open to look\nat him.</p><p>Harry was sat at the side of my bed and when my eyes\ngroggily opened he offered me a soft smile fingers messaging my scalp. I felt\ntired and so sore, I was desperate for a hug from him but even the thought of\nhim touching me anywhere hurt. </p><p>&ldquo;Luke, I called him to tell him you were in labour and he\nsaid that he was already here with Carly. Their little boy was born yesterday.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo; I slurred, reaching a hand up and dropping it\nover his. My hold was light and Harry frowned at it. Whether he was upset at my\nhold or the entire situation we were in I don&rsquo;t know and I was too tired to\nthink about it. </p><p>Harry shook his head and pulled my hand down to press a kiss\nagainst the back of it, careful to avoid hitting the IV. &ldquo;I know but we can\nmake the most of it. We&rsquo;re married now. She&rsquo;ll still have my name and I&rsquo;ll be\nher guardian. It&rsquo;s going to be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next one is yours.&rdquo; I smiled up at him, fighting to keep my\neyes open. </p><p>Harry chuckled quickly and pressed another kiss to the back\nof my hand. &ldquo;I hope so. You&rsquo;re stuck with me now Mrs Styles. Go back to sleep\nbaby.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm, you&rsquo;re so perfect.&rdquo; Harry said to Nora who was bundled\nup in his arms, wrapped tight in a pink fluffy blanket that Gemma had gotten\nher.</p><p>I was beyond tired and ready to go to sleep but Luke still\nhadn&rsquo;t been in yet to see Nora and I wanted to be awake when he did. She was\nborn only an hour ago and I already had to pass her over to someone else. It\nhurt my heart, I wanted to cry but I was to tired to even do that.</p><p>&ldquo;I can tell Luke we need a few more hours.&rdquo; Harry said,\ndrawing my eyes from the little brown curls on Nora&rsquo;s head up to his green\neyes.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; I shifted a bit so I could curl around the\nwarmth of Harry&rsquo;s back. He shifted Nora into one arm and reached back a hand to\nsoothe it over my arm. &ldquo;Want to get it over with so I can go back to sleep.\nAnne and Gemma don&rsquo;t want to wait any longer either.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s lips pulled up into a slight smile as he tugged the soft\nblanket up higher and tucked it around my neck. He had to be just as tired but\nhe was soldiering on through it being the strong one out of the pair of us. A\nquick knock on the door caused me to jump and my heart beat picked up quickly\nand I was starting to feel sick.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to let him in?&rdquo; Harry asked carefully, his\narm tightening protectively around Nora. </p><p>I nodded at him and gave a final look at my little girl\nbefore Harry stood up and headed towards the door. My heart was still beating\nfast and I felt insanely nauseous. I hadn&rsquo;t felt this sick since my first\ntrimester. </p><p>Harry opened the door to Luke and I took in a deep breath to\nsettle everything that felt off inside me. Luke looked a little pale and his\nhands were shaking as he slowly made his way into my room behind Harry so we\nwere in the privacy of my room. Luke flicked his eyes up to Harry after staring\nat Nora, there was shock in his blue eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to hold her?&rdquo; Harry asked Luke after a minute\nwhen he didn&rsquo;t do anything. </p><p>I thought Luke would come in annoyed that Harry got to hold his\ndaughter before he did but no, he was stood there like a deer in headlights not\nbeing able to decide who to look at. Luke nodded nervously and reached out his\narms and very gingerly Harry transferred Nora over as I held on to a deep\nbreath watching the interaction. </p><p>Nora fussed a little at the transfer but quickly settled\ninto her dad&rsquo;s arms as he tucked her up close to his chest. Harry swallowed\ndeeply as he stepped backwards until he was sat back on the bed with me, his\nhand quickly finding mine, shaky fingers linking together.</p><p>Luke was quite for a moment, just admiring his little girl,\nfinger stroking over her features before looking back up to me with tear coated\neyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful Eve&rsquo;s. Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I croaked out. &ldquo;Tired and sore but okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Five minutes hadn&rsquo;t even passed and already I was desperate\nto have her back in my arms. I missed the warmth her little body gave me when I\nheld her, even the smell of her and right now she felt too far away and out of\nmy reach. Having Harry close really did help. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine how I would be\nable to get through this without him here.</p><p>Luke nodded as he sat down in the chair that only recently\nhad Grace in it. He cooed down at Nora and I heard her gurgle back up at him\nand my heart stuttered. This was going to be very difficult for me.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Harry leant over me, his voice dropping low so\nonly I could hear him. &ldquo;Just breathe, he&rsquo;ll be gone in half hour and you&rsquo;ll be\nholding her again.&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded up at him, my hand tightening around his as I kept\nmy mouth shut on what I really wanted to say. Every moment Luke held her made\nme feel like I was losing a bit of her love and even though it was selfish I\ndidn&rsquo;t care. I wanted to have the little perfect bundle all to myself.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you thought of any names?&rdquo; Luke interrupted the\nsilence of the room. </p><p>Harry drew back from me with a tense look. Luke didn&rsquo;t know\nI had already named her Nora, he also didn&rsquo;t know that Harry and I were married\nand that I had changed my last name.</p><p>&ldquo;Nora. We wanted Nora Anne, after Harry&rsquo;s mum, but I\nunderstand why you wouldn&rsquo;t want Anne but I really need her name to be Nora.&rdquo;\nMy voice cracked and I felt myself start to cry. I had my heart set on Nora and\nI wasn&rsquo;t going to budge.</p><p>Luke sniffed and nodded at me. &ldquo;What about her last name?\nThat time at lunch, you said you wanted her to have yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to hyphen it with yours. Styles-Williams.&rdquo;</p><p>Luke&rsquo;s eyebrows furrowed and that seemed to be the first\ntime that he forgot about the baby in his arms. &ldquo;Your last name, not his.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Styles is my last name. We got married a few weeks ago.&rdquo; I\nmumbled the words quietly but somehow Luke still heard me.</p><p>Luke cursed underneath his breath, running a hand over his\nface quickly. I could tell that this wasn&rsquo;t something he expected to hear but I\nwas happy that seemed to be the worst part of his reaction. The room was quiet\nfor a few seconds, the only sound coming from the monitor I still had attached\nto my finger.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay with Nora, I understand how important that is to\nyou, I don&rsquo;t think I can do anything about the last name. Maybe not the middle\nname.&rdquo; Luke concentrated back down at Nora and the room was bathed back in\nawkward silence.</p><p>I could fight to get the middle name for Harry but not now.\nI was too tired and I wasn&rsquo;t going to fight in front of Nora, even when she was\nthis young.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><b>Six months later:</b></p><p>&ldquo;Do not throw up on me.&rdquo; Harry said intently to Nora who was\nsupposed to be having tummy time on the floor but was instead lying on Harry&rsquo;s\nchest who was lying on the living room floor amongst all her toys.</p><p>Nora&rsquo;s lips pulled up into a toothy smile and Harry smiled\nback at her despite how tense he was being with her only a few seconds ago. Shaking\nmy head, I smirked down at the two of them over the top of the manuscript I was\nslowly making my way through. Harry and Nora made for great distractions.</p><p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And it was your own fault for burping her\nwithout a towel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was Gucci,&rdquo; he complained and quickly put his hand up to\nstop her from rolling off his chest. </p><p>A small chuckle passed my lips and Harry glared up at me\nbeneath his long lashes. The dry cleaner got the stain out of the shirt so he\ndidn&rsquo;t have a reason to be bitter about the shirt anymore. </p><p>The little family moment we were having was quickly\ninterrupted by a sharp knock at the door. Harry looked towards the door at the\nsame time I did but not before he bought his hands up to drop them over Nora&rsquo;s\nback as her smile quickly fell and she tried to snuggle into his chest.</p><p>Throwing the manuscript down onto the couch next to me I\nquickly hurried to the front door while Harry started to soothe Nora because\nthe loud knocking was quickly unsettling her.</p><p>&ldquo;Luke?&rdquo; Luke was stood at the door, looking very frazzled\nand his hair had been ruffled up a lot as well. &ldquo;What the hell. I told you to\ntext before coming around.&rdquo;</p><p>Luke pushed past me into the house, shaking his head\nquickly. &ldquo;I know but I need to see her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Luke she won&rsquo;t go to you when you&rsquo;re like this.&rdquo; Hurriedly\nI followed behind him to where Harry was standing with Nora clutched\nprotectively to his chest.</p><p>I had adapted to Luke being around so often again. The\ncustody agreement was for one, three-hour visit a week but he was around three\ntimes a week to see Nora and I didn&rsquo;t mind it. He was being a father and that&rsquo;s\nall I wanted him to do. </p><p>When he came around like this, fuming and without any\nwarning it was always a mess. Nora never wanted to go to him and she would just\nscream until she was blue in the face and back cradled in my arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me my daughter Harry.&rdquo; Luke seethed but Harry didn&rsquo;t\nflinch.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down first.&rdquo; Harry said evenly, hand gentle on Nora&rsquo;s\nback. </p><p>My heart started to race as Luke&rsquo;s anger grew tenfold. Nora\ncould sense his feelings and she started to cry into Harry&rsquo;s neck despite how\nmuch he attempted to soothe her.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to calm down she&rsquo;s my fucking daughter and I\nwant to hold her.&rdquo; Luke&rsquo;s hands came up and grabbed Nora around her sides\ntrying to pull her back from Harry&rsquo;s tight hold.</p><p>That was when I saw red and I shot myself across the room as\nquickly as possible to put myself between Luke and Nora. I didn&rsquo;t care what was\ngoing on with him today, not that he ever told me what the problem was these\ndays, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to have him vent out all his issues with Nora so\nclose.</p><p>&ldquo;How many times do I have to tell you that I don&rsquo;t care how\noften you come around to see her but you cannot see her when you&rsquo;re this angry.\nIf you want to hold her today go outside and calm down first.&rdquo;</p><p>Luke scowled at me. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep her from me Evie.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning he stormed back out of the house, slamming the front\ndoor which caused me to flinch. Lifting a hand up I ran out over my face, my\nchest shaking with my heavy breathes as I heard the sound of tyres screeching\nout of the driveway.</p><p>&ldquo;Evie,&rdquo; Harry said softly and Nora&rsquo;s loud cries drew me back\nto reality. Putting my hands up I tried to take her but Harry shook his head at\nme as well. &ldquo;You need to calm down. You need to calm her down and you can&rsquo;t do\nthat when you&rsquo;re like this.&rdquo;</p><p>I took a few deep breathes and tried to shut my mind off\nfrom what just happened and once Harry was satisfied he passed Nora over to me.\nI cuddled her tight to my chest, pressing small kisses against the side of her\nhead as I stepped back to be sat down on the couch. Harry followed, wrapping\nthe both of us up in his strong arms as he settled next to us.</p><p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t come around when he&rsquo;s like that. He could have\nhurt her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I whispered into Nora&rsquo;s hair.</p><p>She was very slowly starting to calm down but Harry was\nright. Luke took it one step to far, he could have really hurt her by taking\nher from Harry like he did but he didn&rsquo;t even care. Whatever was happening in\nhis life made him blind to the safety of his daughter.</p><p><b>Eleven Months:</b></p><p>My finger slid over my phone as if I kept looking at it I\nwould magically receive a text from Luke. This wasn&rsquo;t like him. I hadn&rsquo;t seen\nhim in two weeks. Nora didn&rsquo;t seem fazed at all by the lack of visits but it\nwas confusing me that Luke suddenly went from two visits a week to not showing\nup or even texting me back to see what was happening.</p><p>&ldquo;Still nothing?&rdquo; Harry asked, watching Nora with furrowed\nbrows as she spooned her yogurt anywhere but into her mouth. It was dripping\ndown her face onto her bib and coated her cheeks but she refused to let Harry\nhelp her. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; I sighed dropping my phone down to the table.\nLeaning over I tried to take the spoon from Nora so she at least managed to get\nsome food into her but she squealed and turned away from me as well.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told him and you&rsquo;ve told his mum. You can&rsquo;t do\nanything more Evie, he needs to make the effort.&rdquo; Harry picked up his own spoon\nfrom his bowl of cereal, eyes soft as he looked over at me.</p><p>I hummed resting my chin in my hands as I rested my\nelbows on the table. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in my breakfast anymore, I felt to\nworried. Harry was right, I didn&rsquo;t need to be worrying over this, I had done\neverything I could have. Nora&rsquo;s first birthday was soon and I had invited Luke\nto come to her party but I hadn&rsquo;t gotten a reply. I didn&rsquo;t want Nora to look\nback on pictures of her first birthday and see her father wasn&rsquo;t there and I\nfelt all the weight of the situation was rested on my shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; I said after a few moments of silence, my\neyes watching Nora as she got sick of the spoon and started using her hands. I\ncouldn&rsquo;t even worry about the mess she was making; her mess would be easy to\nclean up. &ldquo;He made so much drama about being in her life and he visited so much\nand now he&rsquo;s just stopped. Something is wrong.&rdquo; My eyes flicked over to Harry\nwho looked as if he was thinking deeply into what I said.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried Evie, that&rsquo;s all that matters. You&rsquo;ve given\nhim opportunities and he hasn&rsquo;t taken any of them. His mum has tried so don&rsquo;t\nblame yourself for his actions.&rdquo; Reaching across the table Harry took my hand\nand gave it a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>Shaking my head, I ran my fingers over the back of his hand.\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to hurt her.&rdquo; I whispered.</p><p>Both of our eyes flicked back over to Nora and instantly\nI smiled. This tiny human being that was all smiles and covered in yogurt was\nmy entire world and I didn&rsquo;t want anything to hurt even if she was at an age\nthat she wouldn&rsquo;t remember ever being sad. She smiled back up at me and giggled\nas she put a handful of yogurt into her mouth, pride evaporating off her as if\nshe were the smartest person in the room because of her actions. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t deserve this. She deserved to have order in\nher life and because of Luke and all the emotions he was going through, she\nwasn&rsquo;t getting that. I had put all my feelings for Luke aside when she was born\nbecause I wanted what was best for her but sometimes it didn&rsquo;t even seem like\nLuke cared. He wasn&rsquo;t in the right state of mind to be a father and I felt\nhorrible for doing this to my little girl.</p><p>What Nora really deserved was to have Harry&rsquo;s name on her\nbirth certificate and not Luke&rsquo;s.</p></p>",

Liz&rsquo;s\neyes felt like hot pokers stabbing at my skin as I started pull the thin pages\nout. Liz&rsquo;s eyes were bad but Harry&rsquo;s felt like torture. My eyes flicked up to\nlook at him once the top of the pages was visible. His eyes were already\nwatering and his jaw was clenched tightly as he looked down at my shaking\nhands.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo; He whispered when he noticed I was\nlooking up at him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what this piece of paper says, I love you and\nNora so fucking much it hurts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; I whispered, tilting my head back so I\ncould press a soft kiss to his lips.</p>\n</p>",
