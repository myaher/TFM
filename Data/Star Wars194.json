gun control has reached the Supreme Court, but the 2nd amendment took precedent (i believe). gun control must come from the state and local governments, but political participation in these arenas are very low, especially for younger voters. i, as someone who has been involuntarily hospitalized despite voluntarily seeking medical help, am not allowed to buy a gun in the state of california for 5 years. and honestly, i really don\u2019t care because i don\u2019t want to need a gun anyway, but the poor and the middle class in the south feels that they need guns.\u00a0</p><p>2. <b>stay woke: </b>deray said this nearly everyday after michael brown was shot by darren wilson in ferguson, missouri. michael brown was my wake up call to reassess my complacency in the status quo and my participation in reinforcing anti-blackness. in the bay area, the n word was used so casually in places like union city/hayward that we became so desensitized to it. it\u2019s still used casually, but non-black people like myself have no agency in saying it because we\u2019re not black. it\u2019s as simple as that. i began noticing how my family reacted to what would turn into the Black Lives Matter movement, and for the first time, i felt that i could no longer trust my relatives if they were complicit in the <b>murders </b>of black youth simply because they were at the wrong place at the wrong time. i couldn\u2019t even talk to them without crying because of how upset i got from the anti-blackness i would hear. i began to isolate myself and found community on twitter.\u00a0</p><p>3. <b>our youth is a reflection of how good things were and how good things can become if we learn to build community:</b>\u00a0in addition to the community i found on tumblr through avatar, harry potter, and the beatles, i found community with all the losers who had xbox\u2019s instead of ps3\u2032s. we would hang out and play search and destroy (which i still cannot succeed in after all this time smh agjhgarhdfhre) or 1v1 each other on rust. my nerd friends would let my brother and I play with them regardless of how much we sucked, and they hyped me up even when my KDR was trash. these friendships would then transcend from mw2, halo 3, and into runescape. my brother is now really good at overwatch, and the friends i made in middle school are also really good at overwatch. the difference now is that they\u2019re making money off of it, and i\u2019m just like,\u00a0\u201clet\u2019s get this bread, nerds!\u201d thank you for being there for me even though i sucked at everything i tried doing. i was reminded of this when i watched\u00a0\u201cmid90s\u201d by Jonah Hill. our youth was such a pure period of time, but it was also the time we lost ourselves through imposing harmful social norms onto each other, such as the idea that a girl cannot be\u00a0\u201cjust friends\u201d with a boy. but - here\u2019s the kicker - i\u2019m queer, and i don\u2019t really like cis-het men hahahahahahahahaha but whatever.\u00a0</p><p>4. <b>becoming american made me forget who i am</b>: our immigrant parents teach us that the only way is to assimilate into white America, which is essentially what happened to black and brown people following the civil rights movement. the notion of egalitarianism/equality has been nothing but harmful for all of us nonetheless, fueling debates on affirmative action and pitting black people against asian people. one of my best friends from elementary school is in prison for trying to make a living with the resources and skills made available to him. he was apprehended in thousand oaks. he is a black man, and we grew up in the same environment, but his life has been so different since we were in elementary school. the concept of equality/egalitarianism stemming from civil war gains (13th-15th amendments) has manifested into the racial inequality we see today; in other words, the idea that white americans and POC are equal has been harmful because this has never been true and continues to be untrue. my filipino friends and i would get bullied by white latinos for not speaking english in america, which is why i learned to hate myself and my culture. i love myself and my culture, and i am fighting so that i can return home to the philippines someday.\u00a0</p><p>5. <b>our bodies are different, and that\u2019s okay: </b>can y\u2019all believe that i got bullied for not having boobs in the 3rd grade? this is what happens when young girls are sexualized so early. boys participate in this, and they turn out to be shitty boyfriends later on. girls will be girls. girls just wanna be treated like human beings instead of sexual objects. i don\u2019t think this needs to be explained further.\u00a0</p><p>6. <b>america is a settler-colonial state turned global power, and that is problematic: </b>this country began with the murders and deaths of indigenous people because of imperalistic pursuits. it was built on the backs of slave labor from africa. it was reinforced by colonialism through the conquering of countries such as the philippines. we\u2019re socialized to believe that there\u2019s no place like america and that america is such a good place to be in, but that is only true for white Americans and POC who have integrated into white American suburbs.\u00a0</p><p>7. <b>know history, know self:</b>\u00a0- jose rizal\u00a0</p><p>8. <b>if my life wasn\u2019t funny, it would just be true, and that is unacceptable -</b>\u00a0carrie f. fisher</p><p>9. <b>at times, being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you\u2019re living with this illness and functioning, it\u2019s something to be proud of, not ashamed of</b>\u00a0- carrie f. fisher</p><p>10. <b>rebellions are built on hope</b>\u00a0- princess/general leia organa + jyn erso</p><p>11. <b>we have nothing to lose but our chains </b>- assata shakur</p><p>12. <b>keep ya head up</b>\u00a0- tupac shakur</p><p>13. <b>everything i\u2019m not made me everything i am </b>- kanye west</p><p>14. <b>i remember you was conflicted</b></p><p><b>misusing your influence</b></p><p><b>sometimes i did the same</b></p><p><b>abusing my power full of resentment</b></p><p><b>resentment that turned into a deep depression</b></p><p><b>found myself screaming in the hotel room</b></p><p><b>i didn\u2019t wanna self destruct</b></p><p><b>the evils of lucy was all around me</b></p><p><b>so i went running for answers</b></p><p><b>until i came home</b></p><p><b>but that didn\u2019t stop survivor\u2019s guilt</b></p><p><b>going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned</b></p><p><b>or maybe how a-1 my foundation was</b></p><p><b>but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous\u00a0war back in the city</b></p><p><b>i was entering a new one</b></p><p><b>a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination</b></p><p><b>made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned</b></p><p><b>the word was respect</b></p><p><b>just because you wore a different gang color than mine\u2019s</b></p><p><b>doesn\u2019t mean i can\u2019t respect you as a black man</b></p><p><b>forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets</b></p><p><b>if i respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us</b></p><p><b>but i don\u2019t know, i\u2019m no mortal man</b></p><p>- kendrick lamar</p>",

in other words, the idea that white americans and POC are equal has been harmful because this has never been true and continues to be untrue. my filipino friends and i would get bullied by white latinos for not speaking english in america, which is why i learned to hate myself and my culture. i love myself and my culture, and i am fighting so that i can return home to the philippines someday.\u00a0</p><p>5. <b>our bodies are different, and that\u2019s okay: </b>can y\u2019all believe that i got bullied for not having boobs in the 3rd grade? this is what happens when young girls are sexualized so early. boys participate in this, and they turn out to be shitty boyfriends later on. girls will be girls. girls just wanna be treated like human beings instead of sexual objects. i don\u2019t think this needs to be explained further.\u00a0</p><p>6. <b>america is a settler-colonial state turned global power, and that is problematic: </b>this country began with the murders and deaths of indigenous people because of imperalistic pursuits. it was built on the backs of slave labor from africa. it was reinforced by colonialism through the conquering of countries such as the philippines. we\u2019re socialized to believe that there\u2019s no place like america and that america is such a good place to be in, but that is only true for white Americans and POC who have integrated into white American suburbs.\u00a0</p><p>7. <b>know history, know self:</b>\u00a0- jose rizal\u00a0</p><p>8. <b>if my life wasn\u2019t funny, it would just be true, and that is unacceptable -</b>\u00a0carrie f. fisher</p><p>9. <b>at times, being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you\u2019re living with this illness and functioning, it\u2019s something to be proud of, not ashamed of</b>\u00a0- carrie f. fisher</p><p>10. <b>rebellions are built on hope</b>\u00a0- princess/general leia organa + jyn erso</p><p>11. <b>we have nothing to lose but our chains </b>- assata shakur</p><p>12. <b>keep ya head up</b>\u00a0- tupac shakur</p><p>13. <b>everything i\u2019m not made me everything i am </b>- kanye west</p><p>14. <b>i remember you was conflicted</b></p><p><b>misusing your influence</b></p><p><b>sometimes i did the same</b></p><p><b>abusing my power full of resentment</b></p><p><b>resentment that turned into a deep depression</b></p><p><b>found myself screaming in the hotel room</b></p><p><b>i didn\u2019t wanna self destruct</b></p><p><b>the evils of lucy was all around me</b></p><p><b>so i went running for answers</b></p><p><b>until i came home</b></p><p><b>but that didn\u2019t stop survivor\u2019s guilt</b></p><p><b>going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned</b></p><p><b>or maybe how a-1 my foundation was</b></p><p><b>but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous\u00a0war back in the city</b></p><p><b>i was entering a new one</b></p><p><b>a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination</b></p><p><b>made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned</b></p><p><b>the word was respect</b></p><p><b>just because you wore a different gang color than mine\u2019s</b></p><p><b>doesn\u2019t mean i can\u2019t respect you as a black man</b></p><p><b>forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets</b></p><p><b>if i respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us</b></p><p><b>but i don\u2019t know, i\u2019m no mortal man</b></p><p>- kendrick lamar</p>",

gun control has reached the Supreme Court, but the 2nd amendment took precedent (i believe). gun control must come from the state and local governments, but political participation in these arenas are very low, especially for younger voters. i, as someone who has been involuntarily hospitalized despite voluntarily seeking medical help, am not allowed to buy a gun in the state of california for 5 years. and honestly, i really don&rsquo;t care because i don&rsquo;t want to need a gun anyway, but the poor and the middle class in the south feels that they need guns.&nbsp;</p><p>2. <b>stay woke: </b>deray said this nearly everyday after michael brown was shot by darren wilson in ferguson, missouri. michael brown was my wake up call to reassess my complacency in the status quo and my participation in reinforcing anti-blackness. in the bay area, the n word was used so casually in places like union city/hayward that we became so desensitized to it. it&rsquo;s still used casually, but non-black people like myself have no agency in saying it because we&rsquo;re not black. it&rsquo;s as simple as that. i began noticing how my family reacted to what would turn into the Black Lives Matter movement, and for the first time, i felt that i could no longer trust my relatives if they were complicit in the <b>murders </b>of black youth simply because they were at the wrong place at the wrong time. i couldn&rsquo;t even talk to them without crying because of how upset i got from the anti-blackness i would hear. i began to isolate myself and found community on twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>3. <b>our youth is a reflection of how good things were and how good things can become if we learn to build community:</b>&nbsp;in addition to the community i found on tumblr through avatar, harry potter, and the beatles, i found community with all the losers who had xbox&rsquo;s instead of ps3&prime;s. we would hang out and play search and destroy (which i still cannot succeed in after all this time smh agjhgarhdfhre) or 1v1 each other on rust. my nerd friends would let my brother and I play with them regardless of how much we sucked, and they hyped me up even when my KDR was trash. these friendships would then transcend from mw2, halo 3, and into runescape. my brother is now really good at overwatch, and the friends i made in middle school are also really good at overwatch. the difference now is that they&rsquo;re making money off of it, and i&rsquo;m just like,&nbsp;&ldquo;let&rsquo;s get this bread, nerds!&rdquo; thank you for being there for me even though i sucked at everything i tried doing. i was reminded of this when i watched&nbsp;&ldquo;mid90s&rdquo; by Jonah Hill. our youth was such a pure period of time, but it was also the time we lost ourselves through imposing harmful social norms onto each other, such as the idea that a girl cannot be&nbsp;&ldquo;just friends&rdquo; with a boy. but - here&rsquo;s the kicker - i&rsquo;m queer, and i don&rsquo;t really like cis-het men hahahahahahahahaha but whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>4. <b>becoming american made me forget who i am</b>: our immigrant parents teach us that the only way is to assimilate into white America, which is essentially what happened to black and brown people following the civil rights movement. the notion of egalitarianism/equality has been nothing but harmful for all of us nonetheless, fueling debates on affirmative action and pitting black people against asian people. one of my best friends from elementary school is in prison for trying to make a living with the resources and skills made available to him. he was apprehended in thousand oaks. he is a black man, and we grew up in the same environment, but his life has been so different since we were in elementary school. the concept of equality/egalitarianism stemming from civil war gains (13th-15th amendments) has manifested into the racial inequality we see today; in other words, the idea that white americans and POC are equal has been harmful because this has never been true and continues to be untrue. my filipino friends and i would get bullied by white latinos for not speaking english in america, which is why i learned to hate myself and my culture. i love myself and my culture, and i am fighting so that i can return home to the philippines someday.&nbsp;</p><p>5. <b>our bodies are different, and that&rsquo;s okay: </b>can y&rsquo;all believe that i got bullied for not having boobs in the 3rd grade? this is what happens when young girls are sexualized so early. boys participate in this, and they turn out to be shitty boyfriends later on. girls will be girls. girls just wanna be treated like human beings instead of sexual objects. i don&rsquo;t think this needs to be explained further.&nbsp;</p><p>6. <b>america is a settler-colonial state turned global power, and that is problematic: </b>this country began with the murders and deaths of indigenous people because of imperalistic pursuits. it was built on the backs of slave labor from africa. it was reinforced by colonialism through the conquering of countries such as the philippines. we&rsquo;re socialized to believe that there&rsquo;s no place like america and that america is such a good place to be in, but that is only true for white Americans and POC who have integrated into white American suburbs.&nbsp;</p><p>7. <b>know history, know self:</b>&nbsp;- jose rizal&nbsp;</p><p>8. <b>if my life wasn&rsquo;t funny, it would just be true, and that is unacceptable -</b>&nbsp;carrie f. fisher</p><p>9. <b>at times, being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you&rsquo;re living with this illness and functioning, it&rsquo;s something to be proud of, not ashamed of</b>&nbsp;- carrie f. fisher</p><p>10. <b>rebellions are built on hope</b>&nbsp;- princess/general leia organa + jyn erso</p><p>11. <b>we have nothing to lose but our chains </b>- assata shakur</p><p>12. <b>keep ya head up</b>&nbsp;- tupac shakur</p><p>13. <b>everything i&rsquo;m not made me everything i am </b>- kanye west</p><p>14. <b>i remember you was conflicted</b></p><p><b>misusing your influence</b></p><p><b>sometimes i did the same</b></p><p><b>abusing my power full of resentment</b></p><p><b>resentment that turned into a deep depression</b></p><p><b>found myself screaming in the hotel room</b></p><p><b>i didn&rsquo;t wanna self destruct</b></p><p><b>the evils of lucy was all around me</b></p><p><b>so i went running for answers</b></p><p><b>until i came home</b></p><p><b>but that didn&rsquo;t stop survivor&rsquo;s guilt</b></p><p><b>going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned</b></p><p><b>or maybe how a-1 my foundation was</b></p><p><b>but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous&nbsp;war back in the city</b></p><p><b>i was entering a new one</b></p><p><b>a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination</b></p><p><b>made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned</b></p><p><b>the word was respect</b></p><p><b>just because you wore a different gang color than mine&rsquo;s</b></p><p><b>doesn&rsquo;t mean i can&rsquo;t respect you as a black man</b></p><p><b>forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets</b></p><p><b>if i respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us</b></p><p><b>but i don&rsquo;t know, i&rsquo;m no mortal man</b></p><p>- kendrick lamar</p>",
