Even if it meant faking to be his girlfriend to get back with his ex, even if it meant his ex was your ex-best friend and even if it meant you were utterly in love with him, trying your best to get over him- or maybe not.</i></b></p><p><i>AU: One night I felt motivated and started working on this. Some things are based on my own life, my own feelings, and relationships. I hope I delivered with this story!</i></p><hr><p><b>[Saturday, 04:53 am]</b></p><p>Your fingers trailed over the black keyboard of your laptop as you typed in meaningless words, saving each and every one on your Word. Your eyes flew to the clock at the bottom of your laptop screen and it read 04:53 am. You sighed at the time and how fast it had passed by, but continued regardless. This was your Saturday night, most of them were like this. Even most of your normal days ended up like this. You sitting on your bed with your laptop on your legs, only the light from the screen illuminating your face, your headphones plugged in to keep any sound away.</p><!-- more --><p>A strand of hair fell in the middle of your face and you blew it off only for it to fall back down. You placed it behind your ear and continued your work, only for another distraction to pop up. Your phone buzzed beside you, the screen opening. Your eyes darted to it and as soon as you saw Namjoon\u2019s image displayed, you picked it up, eyebrows scrunched together in confusion.</p><p>You just stared at the screen for a mere second, contemplating on whether you should pick up or not. You were already boiling at him having the nerve to call so late at night. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be at a party right now? You were more than sure he had invited you as well, on Wednesday, and you had turned him down because you were mad at him. It was Jungkook\u2019s party but he would understand. Now Namjoon, on the other hand, was just as pissed as you were, as his own best friend turned him down.</p><p>You rolled your eyes and sighed, swiping right.\u00a0\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N! Babe, finally! What took you so long?\u201d He asked. His voice sounded huskier than usual.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d You asked, coldly.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy so harsh? I\u2019m hurt\u201d He said and laughed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m drunk\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks for telling me? If this is a stupid drunk call, then you\u2019re wasting my time\u201d You told him.<br/></p><p>\u201cThe boys were asking for you. I\u2019m at the party you were supposed to come, remember?\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cBut of course, you had better things to do than to hang out with your best friend\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy hanging out, you mean trying to play matchmaker so that you can get back with Sunmin? No thanks, Joon. I\u2019ll pass this time and all the other times you want me to get her to be jealous for you\u201d\u00a0 You went off. You knew this wasn\u2019t the right time to talk to him about your thoughts, yet you also knew that you weren\u2019t going to find any courage to do this while he was sober.<br/></p><p>\u201cI wanted <i>you</i> here, I invited <i>you</i>, not her. If I wanted to invite her, I would have done it\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cJungkook and Taehyung locked me in a closet\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThey- What? Why?\u201d You asked, laughing.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh! I can barely see!\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cI have no idea\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, well. Bye\u201d You said, ready to hang up.<br/></p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He yelled.\u00a0\u201cCome get me. I\u2019m drunk, remember?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a child. Jin will drive you home\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cI want you! Y/N, my baby girl. Just come to daddy, dammit!\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>You chuckled and shut off your laptop.\u00a0\u201cYou are shit drunk, Joon. I\u2019m only coming because you\u2019re stupid when you\u2019re drunk and it doesn\u2019t happen often\u201d</p><p>\u201cI are not stupid!\u201d He complained.</p><p>\u201cWow, apparently you forget your grammar too,\u201d You said, putting him on speaker so that you can throw some clothes on. You can\u2019t show up at a party with literally your underwear and a robe around you. You couldn\u2019t give less shit about how you looked, but you didn\u2019t want to go practically naked. <i>Although most of the whores there are naked at this point.</i><br/></p><p>You heard a loud thud from the other line, more than sure Namjoon has hit his head somewhere. Somehow, he is even more clumsy when he is drunk. If you don\u2019t show up in the next twenty minutes, he could even set the closet on fire without knowing how he did it.\u00a0\u201cI hit my head\u201d He announced as if you hadn\u2019t just heard.\u00a0\u201cTalk to me!\u201d He whined.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and stay still. I\u2019m getting dressed to come there\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d He said, his tone lower.\u00a0\u201cYou could always come naked, you know? It\u2019s always a sight to see you in your underwear, it will be even better with no clothes. I bet. Wear that dark blue skirt you have, you know, the one that always makes your ass pop even more and has everyone wondering how better it might be exposed\u201d<br/></p><p>You almost choked at your own spit at his sudden reveal. You didn\u2019t know people had that opinion for you and what was more surprising was Namjoon\u2019s opinion about you. <i>He\u2019s drunk and talking nonsense</i>, you thought.\u00a0\u201cYou really are a piece of work. And I thought you would be more responsible alone at a party. Usually, I am the one who gets drunk and you are the one who drags me home, you know\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you leave me alone?\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m useless\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI told you not to get drunk,\u201d You said, putting your combat boots on. You laced them up and fixed your hair in the mirror, letting your natural soft curls fall down your shoulders- but reaching just there and not longer. You loved having your hair short. It wasn\u2019t exactly a bob and it wasn\u2019t considered long either. The length was just perfect. When you shot the idea that you wanted to cut your hair to your friends, they kept telling you how you should leave your hair get even longer because it suits you. Long dark hair, for a petite curvy figure in her 20s. Fits just right for their stereotypes.<br/></p><p>But not for you. You\u2019ve wanted this for so long. You still felt so great about your decision and everyone complimented you despite knowing that they don\u2019t like it as much. It made you feel more like yourself, it gave you a sense of confidence no one could understand but you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny\u201d Namjoon interrupted your train of thoughts. You stopped looking at yourself in the mirror and grabbed your phone from your bed.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s funny how you acted all mad when you declined my invite to come to this party, yet you still cared for me enough to tell me not to get drunk. You\u2019re such an idiot, you can\u2019t even hide that you cannot stay mad at me entirely\u201d<br/></p><p>You stopped in your tracks and looked at your phone with a grudge as if he could see you from the other side. You opened your mouth to protest against his claim, but you knew nothing you said would be true. He\u2019s drunk, he won\u2019t remember any of what you say tomorrow anyway.\u00a0\u201cShut up. I like it more when you are sober because you know how to lie and pretend\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d You said and grabbed your keys before stepping out of your apartment to walk to your car. You wrapped your palm around the handle of the driver\u2019s door after unlocking it and opened it, stepping inside. You fastened your seatbelt securely and placed your phone on the passenger\u2019s seat, Namjoon still on speaker. You pressed a few buttons and played your favourite Spotify playlist to drive at night.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAh. There she is. Y/N and her careful driving while listening to music depending on her mood and the time of day\u201d Namjoon said and a small smile formed on your lips at his attention to detail.\u00a0\u201cI never tell you this, but I\u2019m kind of jealous of how good of a driver you are. So careful, mind set. Yet careless at the same time as you play your music and sing along at times. Sometimes you even sing when we talk on the phone and you think that I can\u2019t listen to you, but I do and damn what I would do to listen to that again and again\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you know?\u201d You said, facepalming yourself as you drove out of your neighborhood.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI do\u201d He laughed drunkenly.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful though. At the other hand, my driving is awful\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI second that\u201d You laughed.\u00a0\u201cWhat I like is that drunk, you are as eager to talk as when you are while sober\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, I could talk for ages,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cWith you especially\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d You said as you turned to a corner. You sighed as you spotted the Taco Bell drive through and drove towards the line. Who are you kidding, there is no line at this time. It\u2019s after 5 am.\u00a0\u201cHold on,\u201d You told Namjoon as you pulled at the drive through and placed your finger over the speaker so that he doesn\u2019t hear you order.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHello, what would you like to order?\u201d The man asked from the speaker.<br/></p><p>\u201cHi, can I get three chicken soft tacos, one small fries, one diet coke, and an unsweetened ice tea? Thanks\u201d You ordered and drove a little further. You kept your finger on your speaker until it was time to collect your order and hoped that Namjoon wouldn\u2019t listen. You paid and thanked the cashier quietly, getting no weird looks, surprisingly.<br/></p><p>People are too used to drunk teenagers eating at this time. You placed the bag on the passenger\u2019s seat and left your phone right beside it.\u00a0\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUgh, are you here yet? I\u2019m bored. This party was boring enough without you. Also, I hope nobody saw me wink at Sunmin and then kiss a random girl in beer pong\u201d He giggled.<br/></p><p>Your lips formed a straight line as you let the silence fall to collect your thoughts. He kissed a random girl, during a game. You told yourself you were over this stupid crush of yours on your very own guy best friend, yet at the mention of him touching, talking to or kissing another person still made the unsettling feeling in your stomach appear.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m almost there. Almost\u201d You sighed.</p><p>\u201cGreat because I need to pee too,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cWhat if I pee in this bucket? It fell on me when I hit my head, might as well use it!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNamjoon, no!\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t pee in that bucket you asshole\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need to!\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>\u201cDo not do it. Jungkook will be pissed\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cAs if I care what baby Jungkook thinks,\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>\u201cJoonie&hellip;\u201d You sighed, knowing how to get him to stop.<br/></p><p>\u201cFine\u201d He groaned and you heard him sit back down on the floor. You parked a few meters away from Jungkook\u2019s apartment and took your seatbelt off. You took your phone in your hand and pressed the middle button for it to open.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there in a second. Don\u2019t do anything stupid and piss me off more okay?\u201d You told him.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. You behave as well. No touching others, no grinding over anyone\u2019s dick and no sucking anyone\u2019s di-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJoon! Shut the hell up and let me come take your drunk ass home\u201d You said and ended the call from the rage that he built so quickly. You got off your car, locked it and put your phone in the pocket of your big jean jacket. You stood in front of the bustling apartment, surprised at the number of people still there. You took in a deep breath and a few thoughts popped in your head.<br/></p><p>Why are you doing this? You told yourself you were over with his crap. He has been on and off with you lately and yet acts as if nothing has changed. He has used you as a pawn to get back with his ex-girlfriend, that you got him to date in the first place. He hasn\u2019t had time for you lately either, he has always been hanging out with the boys. You were totally fine with them, you were friends with them as well but he has been making up excuses and canceling plans too many times in the duration of the past three months. And it wasn\u2019t only that, he was still touchy feely with you. Even after he broke up, he likes to play with how you react.</p><p>He has let himself turn into who he never wanted to be and you didn\u2019t know the reason why. He wouldn\u2019t tell you and you couldn\u2019t find the courage to talk to him about it either. You were always a confrontatial person, but in his case, he made you feel weak. You felt like putty in his hands, easy to manipulate. You always stood your ground, always went off about what you didn\u2019t like, yet when he smiled at you the way he did, you just held an unexplanable grudge. You would never tell him what it was about and he would easily take it away and charm his way into being as playful and affectionate as always.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a bad friend. He was far from that. He was the perfect friend if that existed. He had his flaws, but the good parts always shined. He was even an amazing person that a lot of people looked up to and you could see why. Yet when you get to know one person, you get to know more of the flaws, the cracks, the insecurities. All of it.</p><p>\u201cYo, Y/N! Jesus christ, how hard are you zoning out?\u201d Jimin laughed at your face as he waved his hand in front of your eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJimin\u201d You let out a breath you didn\u2019t know you were holding. You smiled at the sane sight of your good friend and ex-boyfriend.\u00a0\u201cSorry\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s serious if you are zoning out this hard,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cLast time you zoned out like this was when we broke up. Then you broke down, kissed me and smiled like a psycho\u201d<br/></p><p>You rolled your eyes at him.\u00a0\u201cTwo years ago. It was a whole two years ago, Jimin\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were too mad at Joon to come\u201d He nudged your shoulder teasingly.<br/></p><p>If one person knew you entirely like an open book, it was Jimin. It was admirable how you two never kept secrets. Even with Namjoon, you two weren\u2019t completely transparent. That is how Jimin and Y/N have always been. Raw, honest, stripped down. That\u2019s why your relationship ended so smoothly. You worked better as good friends and you both knew it, so you made the mutual decision. As if it was possible, you became even more close from that day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah well&hellip; He called\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJust like that\u201d He nodded.\u00a0\u201cHave you really become this soft for him?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI guess\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI even brought him food because he said he was hungry,\u201d You said, shaking your head as you looked down at your boots.<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s locked in the closet next to Jungkook\u2019s room,\u201d He told you.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very aware\u201d You nodded and laughed.\u00a0\u201cWhy did they do it?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know how the two babies love to fuck with Joon when he\u2019s drunk. He\u2019s vulnerable. They literally told him that you were in that closet, so he got in and they locked him\u201d He explained.\u00a0\u201cHe really wanted you here\u201d He looked at you, lowering his head so that he can grab your attention and make you stop looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d You shook your head and looked up, swallowing.\u00a0\u201cI just know that Jin might never get him home if he\u2019s drunk too. He\u2019ll be mad at himself if he doesn\u2019t wake up in his bed tomorrow\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care, yet you go out of your way to come all the way across town, almost at dawn to get him home safely,\u201d He said, propping his eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cOf course you don\u2019t care hun\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJiminie I-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t lie to me\u201d He stated.\u00a0\u201cYou need to tell him how you feel. I know you think it will be stupid and that he will hate you after it, but he\u2019s changed a lot ever since you made that pact to pretend to be his girlfriend so that he can get Sunmin back\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even get how people believe it,\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t even kiss!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need to see you kiss to believe it, Y/N. Everyone thought you two were dating from day one, you know that. You know why? Because of that stupid way Joon always looks at you. And I know what you\u2019re going to say.\u00a0\u2018Jimin, those stares only exist in movies and mean absolute shit!\u2019. Well if they happen only in movies, Namjoon is the perfect candidate to play in\u00a0one because he does it well\u201d He said, trying to change your mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to look weak, Jimin,\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head in confusion.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry but when did expressing your feelings make you look weak? It makes you <i>honest</i>. I thought you knew how to do that, I thought you were done with being fake\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it,\u201d You said, crossing your arms in front of your chest.\u00a0\u201cAt least not today. Not until I am sure\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou will be sure when you end up with seven cats that you will name after us when you turn 70\u2033 He laughed and ruffled your hair.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBetter late than never\u201d You shrugged.<br/></p><p>He rolled his eyes at you and giggled, swinging his arm around your shoulders. He placed a kiss on the top of your head and squeezed you tightly against him in reassurance.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get you inside. You\u2019re never going to make it upstairs without me. If I let you go alone, you might just end up in a jail cell for punching someone to death\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my hate for drunk teenagers dancing at parties too obvious?\u201d You asked as you took your first steps towards the apartment entrance.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re sober it is. When you are drunk, you are the annoyance itself\u2019 He teased you with a wide smirk.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey! I like to party, but by my own rules\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou always are so bossy. Maybe that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t work out. You really do need Joon to dick you down and dom your whiny ass\u201d He smirked harder.<br/></p><p>You punched his shoulder and laughed.\u00a0\u201cI really hate you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby!\u201d He yelled over the music.<br/></p><p>The moment you walked inside and Jimin released you from his embrace to hold your hand and walk in front of you to protect you, a lot of eyes were definitely on you. Or most likely, your bottom half. You really went the route of wearing the skirt Joon told you to wear just to mess him up a little. You received a few quick greetings from Hoseok and Yoongi, Hoseok drunk dancing on top of the coffee table in the living room along with Jin and Jimin helped you pass through the crowd to walk into the kitchen where he knew Jungkook and Taehyung would be, filling up their cups with more alcohol.</p><p>As soon as Jimin released his grip from your hand and you walked in front of your two friends, they stopped drinking, their eyes as wide as an owl\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cWhich one of you fuckers had the brilliant idea?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook gulped down and stuttered.\u00a0\u201cI- I uh I didn\u2019t! It was Taehyung!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d Taehyung exlcaimed and hit Jungkook on his chest.\u00a0\u201cIt was your idea. I don\u2019t want my balls cut off by Y/N. I want to have chldren. You\u2019re doomed to never find a wife, I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole, I swear to god\u201d Jungkook rolled his eyes at Taehyung. As amusing as it was to hear them argue, trying to cover up their little plan, you wanted to get to the point.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d You asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cAn hour? I think more. He might have died\u201d Jungkook said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a dick and it is a proven fact from now on. Brilliant idea, never do it without me again. But do it for a good reason!\u201d You protested.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t go around and push my relationship with Joon like that. It\u2019s uncalled for\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to fuck with him, I\u2019m sorry\u201d Jungkook pouted.<br/></p><p>\u201cNext time you want to know something about us two, just ask me and don\u2019t manipulate Joon. Because I know you did it to prove a point\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhich is that Joon wants your babies,\u201d Taehyung said.\u00a0\u201cHe called you, mission accomplished. Just date for real, it\u2019s tiring\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s not tiring for me either?!\u201d You yelled out of frustration.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not having the best day. He was rambling on the phone and I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. I\u2019m going to go get him\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cRelax. You\u2019re just taking him home\u201d Jimin said as you walked out of the kitchen.<br/></p><p>\u201cI know\u201d You let out a sigh.\u00a0\u201cYou can go now\u201d You smiled at him.<br/></p><p>\u201cText me if anything happens\u201d He kissed your cheek one last time and left you be.<br/></p><p>You took in a deep breath and quickly walked up the stairs. Namjoon was the only one that hadn\u2019t noticed your feelings at this point. Every one of the boys and your girl friends knew. They were also the only people that knew your relationship was just staged. He was such a smart person, his intelligence and his way of understanding everyone around him was admirable, nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t decipher your mind entirely and it drove you insane. You just wished he could see it with his own eyes, make his conclusion and ask you if it is true. The thought of uttering those words to him was simply terrifying.</p><p>Your feet navigated you through the apartment and you knew exactly where that closet was. You remember back a year ago when you were at another party of Jungkook\u2019s. You played Seven Minutes In Heaven. Even if you found it childish, the two vodkas and one shot of tequila in your system, told your brain it would be fun. Namjoon and Hoseok had sent you and Jimin inside this closet because they thought it was a bad idea that you two broke up. You remember Hoseok\u2019s words exactly.\u00a0<i>\u2018Come on you idiots, you still undress each other with those eyes!\u2019</i></p><p><i>Drunk Hoseok never makes sense</i>, you thought. You giggled at the memory of you and Jimin walking inside, being locked in and ending up cracking up. You wanted to make the others think you were actually making out, so you threw a few moans and names here and there. Both of you were sure most of the people playing the game would have their ears on the wood of the door to listen to what was going on. Unfortunately, you blew your plan when Jimin started tickling you and you started laughing hysterically.</p><p>The corners of your lips curled up into a small smile, however, it quickly fell off your pink stained lips and formed a small frown as you prepared yourself to unlock the door to the closet. You had to do this and you had to be cold and quick with it. No having fun, there are limits in your actions. At least there should be, even if you keep them or not.</p><p>You twisted the golden key Jungkook had given you and unlocked the door, opening it slowly. You turned the lights on, which were off the whole time and Namjoon squinted his eyes, hissing.\u00a0\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d You told him, your arms crossed in front of your chest.<br/></p><p>He opened his eyes and stood up carefully, his palm on the wall to help him steady his vulnerable drunken state.\u00a0\u201cYou took your sweet time coming here\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widened as you realized, his hair was no longer black. His smooth black hair has suddenly become a dirty blond colour, which somehow complimented his recently tanned skin tone perfectly.\u00a0\u201cYou- You\u2019re blond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d He grinned widely.\u00a0\u201cWe made a bet with the guys! So I did it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, you are such an idiot\u201d You rolled your eyes and breathed in, taking a whiff of a terrible smell. You squinted your eyes in disgust and pinched your nose with your index finger and your thumb.\u00a0\u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, you took your sweet time. I couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer!\u201d He whined.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh my god, did you seriously pee in the bucket?\u201d You asked, surprised.<br/></p><p>\u201cWanna see?\u201d He asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here. The ones who started this mess in the first place can handle it\u201d<br/></p><p>Namjoon giggled and as soon as he walked out, you locked the closet again and pushed Namjoon towards the bathroom across the hall.\u00a0\u201cFirst you clean your hands and then we can leave\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act worse than my mother, Jesus Y/N\u201d He rolled his eyes. He did as you said and proceeded to clean his face with some water. Surprisingly enough, he could walk perfectly even if he is drunk. Maybe, just maybe the alcohol was starting to wear off of him.<br/></p><p><i>This is your chance Y/N. Leave him here and act as if you never came the next day. You can\u2019t let him sober up and then have him tease you for the rest of the year. What if you start talking in the car and he gets his logic back and you confess something you don\u2019t want him to know? Maybe you\u2019re being overdramatic. He can\u2019t sober up this fast.</i></p><p>You quickly gave Jungkook his key back and tried to get Namjoon out of the party. He followed you behind and you caught Jimin\u2019s stare, gesturing you to call him if anything goes wrong. So many things <i>could</i> go wrong.</p><p>You got Namjoon safely at the back seat of your black SUV and made your way to the driver\u2019s seat. You made sure to get out of the drive way as quickly as possible, not wanting to give any more attention to yourself. You don\u2019t want anyone talking about your cameo appearance in campus tomorrow. That is actually the last thing you want.</p><p>\u201cDoes it smell like food in here?\u201d He asked. He popped his head up from the back seat and his eyes darted to the recyclable Taco Bell paper bag on the passenger\u2019s seat.\u00a0\u201cYou got me food?! God, Y/N I love you\u201d His lips left a quick kiss on your cheek as he hugged you from behind. He is so lucky you are a good driver, otherwise, you could have ended up hitting a tree from his sudden display of affection.</p><p>You decided to park your car at the Taco Bell parking lot, which wasn\u2019t far from your own apartment. You parked at a secluded corner and took in a deep breath after you shut the engine off.\u00a0\u201cYou can come to the front now\u201d</p><p>Like a child getting what it wants, Namjoon climbed out of the back seat and opened the door to the passenger\u2019s seat. You took the paper bag in your hands and set it in the middle of the both of you, taking your iced tea out. The only thing that could calm you down at this point is tea. Everything else seems too uncertain to give you reassurance.</p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d Namjoon exclaimed as soon as he took the first bite out of his taco.\u00a0\u201cYou even got my favourite\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJust eat and shut up,\u201d You said, taking the fries out of the bag. You put your music playlist on, the chill song that came on softly playing in the background of the silence between you and him.<br/></p><p>You were surprised at how quickly he devoured all three tacos and downed his coke like it was water. You were just about done with one small fries and sipped on your last few drops of tea.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon sat back and rubbed his stomach with a smile on his face.\u00a0\u201cThanks\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d You said, looking out of the window. As you looked at the first few cars passing by so early in the morning, you felt Namjoon\u2019s hand on your thigh, playing with the edge of your skirt. His favourite skirt.\u00a0\u201cAh, look at you. You really wore it?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You avoided his stare at all costs. His stare when sane and sober might be deadly, but his drunken stare is inviting and that is all the more worse. It\u2019s too easy for you to manipulate. You could steal your chance and do anything you wanted right about now. You have thought about it plenty of times, so why not do it now?\u00a0\u201cYeah. I wore it\u201d</p><p>He smiled gently, his dimples popping out of both of his cheeks as his thumb caressed the exposed skin of your thigh. He shuffled in his seat and rested his chin on your shoulder, his breath fanning your neck. A trail of goosebumps rose on your honey skin as his lips made contact with your neck. You took in a sharp shaky breath as his tongue darted out on your skin, taking you by surprise.\u00a0\u201cI need to get you home\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d He said, placing a delicate kiss. He brought your skin between his teeth and you knew this was getting too far, too fast. You wanted to savor his lips on your body as much as you could, but you knew it wasn\u2019t right. Every time he got too close, sober or not, every time he put his hands on you so innocently, you felt as if he was your Pandora\u2019s box and you felt more and more intrigued, your will rising each time he grazes your thigh, your hand, your cheek, your neck, anything.<br/></p><p>You knew opening this box, this mind of his and its twisted ways that are so well masked underneath his perfectly sculpted dimples and piercing dark brown eyes would cause an avalanche of problems to fall on your already hurt shoulders, ready to collapse if more burden is put on them. It\u2019s not like your life is perfect. Your life is far from perfect. People like Namjoon just make it a little less shitty and you don\u2019t want to risk losing that.</p><p>You gently pushed Namjoon away and put your hands on the steering wheel, your knuckles turning white from the pressure you put.\u00a0\u201cEnough\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d He pouted.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to sleep\u201d You smiled gently, trying not to show too much of your anger. You turned the engine on and started driving, the familiar road towards the apartment he shares with Jin and Hoseok.</p><p>You caught him furrowing his eyebrows from the corner of your eyes, his pretty pink lips opening to speak and you waited for him to utter the first stupid thing that came into his mind, only for his actually logical question to surprise you.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you going this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to your apartment. Does alcohol make you an amnesiac as well? That\u2019s new\u201d You kept your eyes focused on the road as the first few cars of people going to work have started making their way into the road.<br/></p><p>\u201cI thought I was coming with you. It would be better not to show up like this in the apartment, right?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cI think Hoseok\u2019s girlfriend will be over too\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, so I have to baby you for the rest of the day?\u201d You raised your eyebrow at him. He parted his lips to speak, not knowing how to respond and you shook your head.\u00a0\u201cThis is a one-time thing\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve slept in your apartment before,\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI mean you, drunk, in my apartment. It\u2019s not happening again\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt made everyone see how my girlfriend cares about me though\u201d He smiled and giggled, pressing a light kiss on your shoulder.<br/></p><p>\u201cHa, funny Namjoon. Funny\u201d You let out a cold laugh as you turned and pulled into your neighborhood. Your regular parking spot waited for your car to be placed perfectly in front of the door of your apartment, something that always made your perfectionist side feel the most satisfaction it can possibly feel.<br/></p><p>At this point, Namjoon was able to walk towards your apartment at his own accord and strengh, which you were grateful for. A few more minutes and he could sober up. You can see he is in this sleepy state that if you keep him up for too long, he might just puke the alcohol out and be himself again.</p><p>You practically forced him to sleep on the couch as you didn\u2019t want to wake up next to him in the morning and have to face him. He whined for a few minutes until he passed out. You tucked him in and made your way towards the bathroom to change back into your comfortable pajamas. Even if you felt tired, you tossed and turned on the couch, bothered by the whole situation and finding it unbearable to just let it go. You overthought and analyzed every single day. This night was no different, but it was way more intense.</p><p><i>You need to get over him and stop this madness, Y/N. It\u2019s slowly driving you insane,</i> you thought.</p><p>You had really started to think you had gotten over him the past few weeks. All it took to hit you into reality was this night. This sleepless night of procrastination and guilt.</p><p><b>[Sunday, 12:28 pm]</b></p><p>You stepped your foot into the small local coffee shop you and Jimin loved the bell over the door ringing, announcing your presence. You smiled gently as you saw Jimin waiting at the corner booth you always chose to sit at, two cups of cold brew latte, extra ice for you.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been waiting?\u201d You asked him as you sat down, not bothering to take your big jean jacket off. It smelled like Namjoon from yesterday, as he had decided to steal it from you at some point while he was in the back seat where you had also left your jacket.<br/></p><p>Jimin pushed the cup towards you with a sweet smile and you took your first sip, gladly letting the coffee run in your veins.\u00a0\u201cNot long, I got here five minutes ago. Don\u2019t worry, all of your precious ice cubes have remained intact\u201d</p><p>You smiled like a child getting a brand new strawberry lollipop, a cute toothy smile as you took another sip. You had this weird obsession with eating ice cubes. To be honest, the most exciting part of drinking anything cold was being left with a few drops that coated the ice cubes, to give you a sweet crispy sense in your mouth.\u00a0\u201cThanks\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s lover boy doing?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>\u201cNo idea\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s probably still passed out. It was 7 am when we got back\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDamn, what took you so long? Car sex? I know Namjoon gets even more dominant when he\u2019s drunk, so how are your legs still in place?\u201d He teased you.<br/></p><p>You rolled your eyes at him and curled your lips around your straw.\u00a0\u201cYour humor is especially awful today, Park Jimin. I got him food, we ate it in the parking lot and we left. What took so long was me contemplating to walk into the party in the first place\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yeah\u201d He laughed.\u00a0\u201cYou looked like a lost puppy. That\u2019s how he makes you look when you think of him\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot a good look on me, I hate not knowing shit,\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you seriously asking me? You know what, if you are asking it is actually serious\u201d He said, furrowing his eyebrows.<br/></p><p>You looked around cautiously, hoping no one that knew you were looking and moved your thick choker to allow him to see the purple hickey on your neck. You weren\u2019t expecting Namjoon\u2019s playful little drunk bites to leave a hickey this dark, yet here you were wearing a choker after months.\u00a0\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Jimin said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I was wondering why you wore a choker. I thought you dropped them long ago, as they- and I quote-\u00a0\u2018aren\u2019t in fashion anymore\u2019. Can you enlighten me? Did you really eat food? Because it seems to me as if Namjoon went right to dessert\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get laid last night? Because you seem awfully cheery today\u201d You shot back.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes indeed!\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cBut this is not about me here. This is about your little sexscapade with Namdaddy\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWould you stop!\u201d You laughed, sending him a death glare.\u00a0\u201cHe just&hellip; After we ate, we just sat there, my music was playing and he started being&hellip; touchy\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSounds like a regular day to me,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cHe always does that, Y/N\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe held my upper thigh, he kissed my neck and he gave me a hickey, Jimin. A freaking <i>hickey</i>\u201d You whispered but yelled at him at the same time.\u00a0\u201cI know we\u2019re always touchy but&hellip; When he called me to tell me he was locked in that closet, I told him I was getting ready and he went on to talk about me and how good my ass would look naked and how he wants to hear my singing again because it is good to him\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDamn, he went soft on you? And he still doensn\u2019t let himself see how much he likes you?\u201d He asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, Jimin. If I confront him about this, he will deny all of it. He might act all mighty and dominant but he\u2019s a coward and I don\u2019t want to risk our friendship. It\u2019s as if I had feelings for your crush and I told you\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t have him be all touchy-feely with me anymore. It adds fuel to the fire and I definitely cannot pretend to be his girlfriend any longer. He told me he kissed a random girl for beer pong and I got jealous\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d He asked, raising both of his eyebrows. He locked his jaw in place and you knew for a fact, he was about to say something big.\u00a0\u201cDid he leave out the detail that this random girl was actually Sunmin? Did he also forget to tell you that I found him in Jungkook\u2019s room, zipping his pants with Sunmin rushing out?\u201d<br/></p><p>Your lips parted and your jaw dropped in surprise.\u00a0\u201cHe was lucky it was nobody else. He really risked his own stupid plan. He has Sunmin being the biggest slut out there and he\u2019s bulding himself a fuckboy title. You two really need to talk, Y/N. I don\u2019t care what exactly you will tell him, but this pact is not good for any of you\u201d</p><p>You nodded and bit your lip, breaking an ice cube with your teeth to calm you down.\u00a0\u201cHe cheated on his imaginary girlfriend and then asked for her to pick up his mess. How romantic\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was plastered and he doesn\u2019t accept his feelings. Let\u2019s be honest, the way he is handling everything, he\u2019s not going to be acting sane unless you slap some sense into him\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cTurn the tables, Y/N. Be the smart one and the one who will sooth your problems. Namjoon might be good with feelings about loving yourself, but he is definitely not good with feelings towards other people\u201d<br/></p><p>You nodded again, taking the last sip of your coffee.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do with him anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe slept at my place. He slept on the bed, I slept on the couch. Well, I didn\u2019t sleep, I could only get a 30-minute nap. I woke up, got showered, dressed, wrote him a note asking him to be out of my apartment by 1 pm and drove here\u201d You said, biting down on your lip, a habit you always found solace in when you felt guilty or giddy.\u00a0\u201cI let him use the shower though\u201d<br/></p><p>Jimin laughed and smiled at you, shaking his head at your cute way of trying to stay mad at Namjoon.</p><p><b>[Thursday, 17:04 pm]</b></p><p>You made your way out of your college campus, finally done with your classes for today and plugged in one of your earphones to listen to your regular music, a coping mechanism for you. Whenever your feelings get all distorted or too intense, you have found music to work the best in calming you down. Nevertheless, the song that came on shuffle in your chill playlist didn\u2019t exactly help with keeping your mind quiet.</p><p><i>Why did Ariana Grande have to make such relatable songs?!</i>, you thought.</p><p>You walked out, your feet carrying you towards the parking lot until more students started to come out and a familiar face caught your attention. You locked eyes and you cursed under your breath. This has been a confrontation you have been avoiding for as many days as you could, even if you promised Jimin you would be done with it very soon.\u00a0</p><p>Your pace quickened as you saw Namjoon walk towards you. Why did he have to wear that flowy blue and white shirt? All you want to do is take it off of him. He even paired it with a grey beanie. The things he does to you with solely his sense of fashion are incredible.</p><p><i>Focus, Y/N.</i></p><p>He picked up your pace and started walking beside you. You raised your hand with your other earphone in hand, but he caught your wrist so that you can\u2019t plug it in. He wrapped his arm around your shoulders with a smile on his face and placed a peck on your cheek.\u00a0\u201cWhere has my lovely girlfriend been the whole week while everyone was thinking how good we looked together at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing important things, now could you let me breathe? I\u2019d appreciate it\u201d You said. <i>Of course, he wants you only for this publicity stunt.</i><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been ignoring me ever since the party. What\u2019s wrong with you lately? You kick me out of your apartment with a note and then give no shits about me?\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cI thought we were on the same page here\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe are. I picked you up from the party. Isn\u2019t that enough Namjoon?\u201d You asked. He stepped in front of you and put his hands on your shoulders, stopping you from walking any further.\u00a0\u201cI need to be at work by 6\u2033<br/></p><p>\u201cCall in sick,\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I make a living out of that intership, I can\u2019t lie\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it,\u201d He said, snatching your phone from your hands. He unplugged your earphones, making the music stop and you saw him search for the call app.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, give it back!\u201d You protested, trying to take it away from him. Namjoon blocked your small frame by placing his arm in front of your chest and dialed the number of your work with his free hand. He put the phone next to his ear and placed his index finger in front of your plump lips to silence you.<br/></p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of Y/N L/N, I\u2019m her boyfriend. Nice to meet you too. Yeah, she can\u2019t be present today as she is sick. Yeah she has the flu, you know, from all the iced drinks she has every day\u201d He laughed lightly and your eyes threw darts towards him. \u201cCareless Y/N. She\u2019s extremely sorry. Oh yes, thank you! I will tell her that. Thank you very much, have a nice day\u201d He smiled and ended the phone call. Without a warning, he shot you a cold smile as he put your phone in the back pocket of his jeans.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not getting it back until I say so. Your tricks of putting music on as a way to stop listening to me are over\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThis is a violation of my privacy!\u201d You protested. He rolled his eyes from your loud demeanor and pulled you towards a hall, where nobody could hear you.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?! I don\u2019t need to talk right now Namjoon\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t whine. I scored you a sick leave from today until Sunday, be grateful\u201d He said.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a sick leave, I\u2019m not sick! You make me sick, not a disease. But you know what? You\u2019re just like a disease. You stick on people and only leave if you kill it. And that is my last solution so guess who\u2019s going to end up dead by the end of this sick leave\u201d You smiled coldly.<br/></p><p>\u201cStop being a child,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cYou came to the party\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd you peed in a bucket, what\u2019s your point?\u201d You asked, shrugging.<br/></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows and squinted his eyes in complete confusion.\u00a0\u201cI did?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cY/N, this is not the point! You came to the party when you said you wouldn\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me and you were drunk. Unfortunately, I\u2019m the only person that you act sane around when drunk so I couldn\u2019t leave you to the others to handle. I needed to come\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat happened? It didn\u2019t really look good for you to show up, drag me out and then make no contact with me until today\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cAnd that song you posted on your Instagram story a couple of days ago? Better off without him? What the fuck Y/N? Everyone thinks we broke up\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo what? This doesn\u2019t look good, that doesn\u2019t look good, nothing looks good lately. Well seems like I\u2019m not good enough for the fake girlfriend part\u201d You shrugged, ignorant of his ego.\u00a0\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll fabricate a good break up story for you. Like, Namjoon breaks up with current girlfriend because he cheated on her with his ex or something like that\u201d You shot.<br/></p><p>He was left dumbfounded, his lips parted as he gulped down nervously.\u00a0\u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m fabricating stories. Although I\u2019m surprised with how well everyone is hiding from me the fact that you kissed some random girl during beer pong. Maybe it was because they were plastered and have probably forgotten about my existance. They always do\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kiss anyone\u201d He lied.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou called me and told me yourself, Namjoon. But I mean it\u2019s fine as long as your image is not destroyed, right?\u201d You smiled, a fake smile. You felt so done with his shit and all of his plans to keep his image clean in order to get what he wants. You could seriously punch him at this point and not be sorry for it at all.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. This is awfully confusing\u201d He shook his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s confusing, huh? Have you ever thought how goddamn exhausting it might be for me as well? Pretending when I\u2019m only just finding myself. It\u2019s quite of a let down when the person who helped you find yourself in the first place is the one who made you lose it in mere seconds as well\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI- Then what the hell are you implying? That we should break up?\u201d He asked.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe might as well do. We might as well do, in all meanings. I need closure Namjoon. I don\u2019t want you in my life anymore if you\u2019re going to let me get lost in my own thoughts and guilt again. You helped me break down my walls and now you\u2019re just giving me the bricks to rebuild it\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cBut you just won\u2019t let me,\u201d You said. Your voice was getting weaker than before and you could feel your eyes water and your cheeks heat. It has been such a long time ever since you last cried and so many emotions have built inside you for the past week, that maybe giving up and accepting to talk to him wasn\u2019t the best idea for your mental stability.</p><p>You crossed your arms in front of your chest and bit your lip, trying not to let yourself slip from your own hands as you looked around for any passersby.\u00a0\u201cI never knew I made you feel this way\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, living behind a mask and building an ego as high as yours can do that, surprisingly\u201d You laughed coldly.\u00a0\u201cLet me breathe, Namjoon\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI- You can\u2019t just leave me. You have been away from me for days, isn\u2019t that enough? For me it seemed like an eternity of trying to get a minute alone with you\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Wanting to get that attention, to feel that sort of affection from someone, but he or she just gives it to anybody but you? Sucks to be you, really\u201d You said. Your anger boiled and you felt a knot tie at the pit of your stomach.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I have been neglecting your needs of being the cover for you to be a fuck up. I don\u2019t think being a fuckboy is really the image you want right now, is it?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhatever you are saying makes no sense to me whatsoever\u201d He shook his head, huffing.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re acting as if we really are dating. If you want to change the rules of the pact just let me know. Did you change your mind on the no kissing policy? We can change that you know, I never understood why kissing was forbidden in the first place. Sometimes I feel like you are in love with me or something\u201d He snorted.</p><p>You burst out laughing, not able to hold it in anymore. Doesn\u2019t he understand how badly he has damaged himself? How much his plan has changed him. He can\u2019t even think properly anymore. All he does is lie and deny each and every one of his mistakes.\u00a0\u201cDo you really think lying will get you anywhere? I am doing you a favor here Namjoon. A bloody favor is what leaving you is. You got what you wanted, you got Sunmin back. You never even lost her, you always had her and that is why it was so easy to get her into bed with you. I\u2019m only an obstacle for you now\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try to lie about it anymore. Jimin told me he walked in on you after you were done, in Jungkook\u2019s bedroom\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>He closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, streching his hands at the back of his head. He hit his fist on the wall out of frustration.\u00a0\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so frustrated for? You were planning to keep it a secret from me forever?\u201d You asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on letting that happen in the first place. I wasn\u2019t planning on getting shit faced either, you know. But that\u2019s who I am when you\u2019re not there. Having to baby your drunk ass is way more fun you know\u201d He smiled, guilt in his smile.\u00a0\u201cSleeping with Sunmin was&hellip; it was just as if I had sex just to not be frustrated anymore, but look what I did now! I thought that if I slept with her I would get my head back in the game and stop wanting to mess everything up, but it made it worse\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you frustrated for, exactly? Your life is freaking perfect! You have so many amazing friends, you have girls running behind you all the time, Sunmin never stopped wanting to be the slut she is with you\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cNot to brag, but you also got the priviledge of making me feel bad. I\u2019ve kind of heard making Y/N feel like a waste of life is very fun. Sunmin knows that\u201d<br/></p><p>He took in a deep breath and nodded to himself.\u00a0\u201cI thought she had changed\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t change just like that, Joon. And they definitely do not regret their actions easily if they have an ego as big as hers\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cYou know, I only agreed to this pact because I thought it would take no time for it to be over with. Just a sweet little torture. Since Sunmin hates my guts, I thought she would get mad and want you back right away. I also only want to see you happy, which is what she made you feel like. I thought she changed myself, I thought she started becoming a better person, but the fact that she slept with you at that party, the party she knew for a fact I wasn\u2019t going, means she hasn\u2019t changed one bit. She keeps hurting me even after two years and now she made you hurt me too\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, let me speak. I have the <i>right </i>to speak\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI never understood why you dated her in the first place. You were the one to pull me out of the hole she threw me in and I thought you were on my side. The angry one. But then you told me you met her, talked to her at a party and you thought she seemed nice. It was a year after she hurt me. Naturally, the stupid girl I am, I believed you. Only because I missed her. It is true that you can be mad at someone and miss them at the same time, Namjoon. You two just seem to get that out of me. She made you happy when you dated and I felt as if&hellip; as if this girl\u2019s purpose was to just take away from me all I love, constantly. She was my best friend. Then she took that away from me and she also took you from me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let her take me,\u201d He said, shaking his head.\u00a0\u201cI- I acted like I was naive\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou were\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cBut she has that power, to seem as if she has changed and then turn into the two-faced person she is. I agreed to the pact because I thought I would finally get my best friend back. Yet she still seemed to be the only thing you talked about. We never talked about me anymore and I had to take care of myself on my own. But I also got so obsessed with playing your girlfriend and making sure you were happy that I forgot what I actually wanted\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s worse than you think it is, Y/N. I- Sunmin just helped me open my eyes but you know that sometimes I get lost too. Sometimes I am selfish and put myself first. I thought that if I got back with her maybe everything would be normal again\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou should have told me, Namjoon. You know for a fact that just because I have depression, just because I used to want to end it all doesn\u2019t mean I am some delicate flower. You can talk to me. You can tell me how you feel\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI am even more mad at you for not opening up\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I talked to you, I would have lost you\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI saw how eager you were into helping me get Sunmin back, I got it as a message that that is all you wanted. For me to date someone else. I kind of used you in a way. I did initially want Sunmin back but falling into the routine of acting as if we were together felt good and for a moment I forgot about her. It felt&hellip; refreshing to not be suffocated with the thought of her. Because that\u2019s how it feels when I\u2019m with you. You know that feeling? When sometimes, when things are a certain way, it feels as if everything has fallen into place?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI know how it feels\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t think you are healthy for me anymore, Namjoon. Jimin thinks that too. Everyone can see it, besides you\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCan see what?\u201d He asked, clueless over the fact that you are head over heels for your own best friend.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat-\u201d You took in a deep breath.\u00a0\u201cJimin told me&hellip; He told me that everyone can see how we feel about one another but us. He said you have that\u00a0\u2018look\u2019 on your face. That look someone has when they are whipped for someone. The look that always makes you smile when we watch KDramas together. When the guy looks at the girl with hearts in his eyes or whatever\u201d<br/></p><p>He laughed lightly and nodded, licking his lips.\u00a0\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I know?! I\u2019m just a naive girl that- never mind. Let\u2019s leave it at that\u201d You said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI want to change something in our rules for the pact,\u201d He said, clearing his throat. The moment you thought he understood you, he brought up the pact again.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou&hellip; What?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI want to erase the no kissing rule,\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Your eyes widened.<br/></p><p>\u201cI want to know&hellip;\u201d He took a step further.\u00a0\u201cI want to confirm how whipped I am\u201d He smiled cheekily. His dimples popped, perfectly carved into both of his cheeks as always. He held your chin with his index finger and as your eyes were locked on his lips, you forgot what he even told you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay stop\u201d You shook your head, seeing as this was getting out of hand.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t be touching me like this anymore!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat? Like what? Did you hear what I told you?\u201d He asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cLike - like we\u2019re an item! Or you can\u2019t look at me like you want to undress me and eat me for dessert. And when I told you I don\u2019t want you drunk around me anymore, I meant it! You told me you wanted to see me naked and you can\u2019t do that!\u201d You started stomping up and down in front of him, trying to shake away the thought of his lips. His lips on your neck, his hand on your thigh, his eyes sinking into yours and your skin melting under his fingertips.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be getting over you!\u201d</p><p>Namjoon raised his brows and laughed.\u00a0\u201cDid you just think out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I- No!\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m playing the fake girlfriend\u201d You lied.\u00a0\u201cAs the fake girlfriend, I think you are a bad kisser so I don\u2019t want to kiss you\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know, Jimin is right. We\u2019re goddamn blind and in your case, you are deaf too\u201d He said. Namjoon took your hands and stopped you in front of him for what seemed like the tenth time today.<br/></p><p>\u201cExcuse you! My senses are great!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYet when I told you I want to see how whipped I am for you, you hear nothing\u201d He giggled.<br/></p><p>Your lips parted and you looked at him dumbfounded.\u00a0\u201cUh&hellip; what? Pft! Of course, I heard that. God, you\u2019re such a good actor\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod Y/N, stop it\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cAnswer this question for me. Why in the world, when you have all you want in front of you, you just let it go? You always put others first. Be a little selfish and <i>kiss me</i>\u201d<br/></p><p>For a moment you thought you were hallucinating for real. You thought you were dreaming or reading one of your own awful works. But it was him, right in front of you, asking you to break the number one rule you had set months ago. You\u2019ve never wanted to be a rebel more in your life and you took your chance. You grabbed the collar of his shirt and crashed his lips against yours. You stood on your tip toes, the height difference between the two of you immense. A smile formed on Namjoon\u2019s lips but it didn\u2019t break the kiss, it even made it better.</p><p>He grabbed your waist and lifted you up. You wrapped your legs around his waist and he secured you by pushing you against the maroon brick wall. It is one thing to imagine how kissing him would feel like and another how it actually felt in reality. No, kissing him didn\u2019t seem like a dream. It felt like it completed all that has been happening for years now. Like it justified how you acted with one another.</p><p>You smiled throughout the kiss and were eventually the one to break it, as you giggled from the fact that Namjoon had to lift you up so you could kiss.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I couldn\u2019t help it. Jesus Christ, I can\u2019t even reach your face Joon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tiny and I love it\u201d He smirked.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d You pouted.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t act as if this saved everything. You have a lot to make up for\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMhm. I know\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cBut I have four days of you to myself to fix it since you don\u2019t have to go to work\u201d His lips pulled into a cheeky grin and you playfully smacked his arm.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d You said. He looked down at you, caressing your cheek with his thumb. He placed a strand of hair behind your ear and his eyes traveled towards your neck.</p><p>\u201cHa. Seems like the hickey I gave you wasn\u2019t that bad anyway. I should make up for that\u201d He said.<br/></p><p>Your eyes widened at his words. How did he know that he gave you a hickey?\u00a0\u201cDid- How do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that all I did after we ate, was of my own accord\u201d<br/></p><hr><p><b><a href=\"https://evasthoughtplace.tumblr.com/post/174789672548/masterlist-bts\">Masterlist</a></b></p><p><i>Dedicated to my babes: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4-K_poMzR3fbfh0_Tf6ig\">@gukkmeup</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9lbRVplFQzzK-YVZ_tTerQ\">@introjinnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLP_jnUZaduXd_j_Ln32ZQ\">@hobi-stole-my-heart</a></i></p>",

Even if it meant faking to be his girlfriend to get back with his ex, even if it meant his ex was your ex-best friend and even if it meant you were utterly in love with him, trying your best to get over him- or maybe not.</i></b></p><p><i>AU: One night I felt motivated and started working on this. Some things are based on my own life, my own feelings, and relationships. I hope I delivered with this story!</i></p><hr><p><b>[Saturday, 04:53 am]</b></p><p>Your fingers trailed over the black keyboard of your laptop as you typed in meaningless words, saving each and every one on your Word. Your eyes flew to the clock at the bottom of your laptop screen and it read 04:53 am. You sighed at the time and how fast it had passed by, but continued regardless. This was your Saturday night, most of them were like this. Even most of your normal days ended up like this. You sitting on your bed with your laptop on your legs, only the light from the screen illuminating your face, your headphones plugged in to keep any sound away.</p>[[MORE]]<p>A strand of hair fell in the middle of your face and you blew it off only for it to fall back down. You placed it behind your ear and continued your work, only for another distraction to pop up. Your phone buzzed beside you, the screen opening. Your eyes darted to it and as soon as you saw Namjoon\u2019s image displayed, you picked it up, eyebrows scrunched together in confusion.</p><p>You just stared at the screen for a mere second, contemplating on whether you should pick up or not. You were already boiling at him having the nerve to call so late at night. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be at a party right now? You were more than sure he had invited you as well, on Wednesday, and you had turned him down because you were mad at him. It was Jungkook\u2019s party but he would understand. Now Namjoon, on the other hand, was just as pissed as you were, as his own best friend turned him down.</p><p>You rolled your eyes and sighed, swiping right.\u00a0\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N! Babe, finally! What took you so long?\u201d He asked. His voice sounded huskier than usual.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d You asked, coldly.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy so harsh? I\u2019m hurt\u201d He said and laughed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m drunk\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks for telling me? If this is a stupid drunk call, then you\u2019re wasting my time\u201d You told him.<br></p><p>\u201cThe boys were asking for you. I\u2019m at the party you were supposed to come, remember?\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cBut of course, you had better things to do than to hang out with your best friend\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy hanging out, you mean trying to play matchmaker so that you can get back with Sunmin? No thanks, Joon. I\u2019ll pass this time and all the other times you want me to get her to be jealous for you\u201d\u00a0 You went off. You knew this wasn\u2019t the right time to talk to him about your thoughts, yet you also knew that you weren\u2019t going to find any courage to do this while he was sober.<br></p><p>\u201cI wanted <i>you</i> here, I invited <i>you</i>, not her. If I wanted to invite her, I would have done it\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cJungkook and Taehyung locked me in a closet\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThey- What? Why?\u201d You asked, laughing.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh! I can barely see!\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cI have no idea\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, well. Bye\u201d You said, ready to hang up.<br></p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He yelled.\u00a0\u201cCome get me. I\u2019m drunk, remember?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a child. Jin will drive you home\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cI want you! Y/N, my baby girl. Just come to daddy, dammit!\u201d He said.<br></p><p>You chuckled and shut off your laptop.\u00a0\u201cYou are shit drunk, Joon. I\u2019m only coming because you\u2019re stupid when you\u2019re drunk and it doesn\u2019t happen often\u201d</p><p>\u201cI are not stupid!\u201d He complained.</p><p>\u201cWow, apparently you forget your grammar too,\u201d You said, putting him on speaker so that you can throw some clothes on. You can\u2019t show up at a party with literally your underwear and a robe around you. You couldn\u2019t give less shit about how you looked, but you didn\u2019t want to go practically naked. <i>Although most of the whores there are naked at this point.</i><br></p><p>You heard a loud thud from the other line, more than sure Namjoon has hit his head somewhere. Somehow, he is even more clumsy when he is drunk. If you don\u2019t show up in the next twenty minutes, he could even set the closet on fire without knowing how he did it.\u00a0\u201cI hit my head\u201d He announced as if you hadn\u2019t just heard.\u00a0\u201cTalk to me!\u201d He whined.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and stay still. I\u2019m getting dressed to come there\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d He said, his tone lower.\u00a0\u201cYou could always come naked, you know? It\u2019s always a sight to see you in your underwear, it will be even better with no clothes. I bet. Wear that dark blue skirt you have, you know, the one that always makes your ass pop even more and has everyone wondering how better it might be exposed\u201d<br></p><p>You almost choked at your own spit at his sudden reveal. You didn\u2019t know people had that opinion for you and what was more surprising was Namjoon\u2019s opinion about you. <i>He\u2019s drunk and talking nonsense</i>, you thought.\u00a0\u201cYou really are a piece of work. And I thought you would be more responsible alone at a party. Usually, I am the one who gets drunk and you are the one who drags me home, you know\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you leave me alone?\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m useless\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI told you not to get drunk,\u201d You said, putting your combat boots on. You laced them up and fixed your hair in the mirror, letting your natural soft curls fall down your shoulders- but reaching just there and not longer. You loved having your hair short. It wasn\u2019t exactly a bob and it wasn\u2019t considered long either. The length was just perfect. When you shot the idea that you wanted to cut your hair to your friends, they kept telling you how you should leave your hair get even longer because it suits you. Long dark hair, for a petite curvy figure in her 20s. Fits just right for their stereotypes.<br></p><p>But not for you. You\u2019ve wanted this for so long. You still felt so great about your decision and everyone complimented you despite knowing that they don\u2019t like it as much. It made you feel more like yourself, it gave you a sense of confidence no one could understand but you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny\u201d Namjoon interrupted your train of thoughts. You stopped looking at yourself in the mirror and grabbed your phone from your bed.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s funny how you acted all mad when you declined my invite to come to this party, yet you still cared for me enough to tell me not to get drunk. You\u2019re such an idiot, you can\u2019t even hide that you cannot stay mad at me entirely\u201d<br></p><p>You stopped in your tracks and looked at your phone with a grudge as if he could see you from the other side. You opened your mouth to protest against his claim, but you knew nothing you said would be true. He\u2019s drunk, he won\u2019t remember any of what you say tomorrow anyway.\u00a0\u201cShut up. I like it more when you are sober because you know how to lie and pretend\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d You said and grabbed your keys before stepping out of your apartment to walk to your car. You wrapped your palm around the handle of the driver\u2019s door after unlocking it and opened it, stepping inside. You fastened your seatbelt securely and placed your phone on the passenger\u2019s seat, Namjoon still on speaker. You pressed a few buttons and played your favourite Spotify playlist to drive at night.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAh. There she is. Y/N and her careful driving while listening to music depending on her mood and the time of day\u201d Namjoon said and a small smile formed on your lips at his attention to detail.\u00a0\u201cI never tell you this, but I\u2019m kind of jealous of how good of a driver you are. So careful, mind set. Yet careless at the same time as you play your music and sing along at times. Sometimes you even sing when we talk on the phone and you think that I can\u2019t listen to you, but I do and damn what I would do to listen to that again and again\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you know?\u201d You said, facepalming yourself as you drove out of your neighborhood.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI do\u201d He laughed drunkenly.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful though. At the other hand, my driving is awful\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI second that\u201d You laughed.\u00a0\u201cWhat I like is that drunk, you are as eager to talk as when you are while sober\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, I could talk for ages,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cWith you especially\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d You said as you turned to a corner. You sighed as you spotted the Taco Bell drive through and drove towards the line. Who are you kidding, there is no line at this time. It\u2019s after 5 am.\u00a0\u201cHold on,\u201d You told Namjoon as you pulled at the drive through and placed your finger over the speaker so that he doesn\u2019t hear you order.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHello, what would you like to order?\u201d The man asked from the speaker.<br></p><p>\u201cHi, can I get three chicken soft tacos, one small fries, one diet coke, and an unsweetened ice tea? Thanks\u201d You ordered and drove a little further. You kept your finger on your speaker until it was time to collect your order and hoped that Namjoon wouldn\u2019t listen. You paid and thanked the cashier quietly, getting no weird looks, surprisingly.<br></p><p>People are too used to drunk teenagers eating at this time. You placed the bag on the passenger\u2019s seat and left your phone right beside it.\u00a0\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUgh, are you here yet? I\u2019m bored. This party was boring enough without you. Also, I hope nobody saw me wink at Sunmin and then kiss a random girl in beer pong\u201d He giggled.<br></p><p>Your lips formed a straight line as you let the silence fall to collect your thoughts. He kissed a random girl, during a game. You told yourself you were over this stupid crush of yours on your very own guy best friend, yet at the mention of him touching, talking to or kissing another person still made the unsettling feeling in your stomach appear.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m almost there. Almost\u201d You sighed.</p><p>\u201cGreat because I need to pee too,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cWhat if I pee in this bucket? It fell on me when I hit my head, might as well use it!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNamjoon, no!\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t pee in that bucket you asshole\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need to!\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cDo not do it. Jungkook will be pissed\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cAs if I care what baby Jungkook thinks,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cJoonie\u2026\u201d You sighed, knowing how to get him to stop.<br></p><p>\u201cFine\u201d He groaned and you heard him sit back down on the floor. You parked a few meters away from Jungkook\u2019s apartment and took your seatbelt off. You took your phone in your hand and pressed the middle button for it to open.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there in a second. Don\u2019t do anything stupid and piss me off more okay?\u201d You told him.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. You behave as well. No touching others, no grinding over anyone\u2019s dick and no sucking anyone\u2019s di-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJoon! Shut the hell up and let me come take your drunk ass home\u201d You said and ended the call from the rage that he built so quickly. You got off your car, locked it and put your phone in the pocket of your big jean jacket. You stood in front of the bustling apartment, surprised at the number of people still there. You took in a deep breath and a few thoughts popped in your head.<br></p><p>Why are you doing this? You told yourself you were over with his crap. He has been on and off with you lately and yet acts as if nothing has changed. He has used you as a pawn to get back with his ex-girlfriend, that you got him to date in the first place. He hasn\u2019t had time for you lately either, he has always been hanging out with the boys. You were totally fine with them, you were friends with them as well but he has been making up excuses and canceling plans too many times in the duration of the past three months. And it wasn\u2019t only that, he was still touchy feely with you. Even after he broke up, he likes to play with how you react.</p><p>He has let himself turn into who he never wanted to be and you didn\u2019t know the reason why. He wouldn\u2019t tell you and you couldn\u2019t find the courage to talk to him about it either. You were always a confrontatial person, but in his case, he made you feel weak. You felt like putty in his hands, easy to manipulate. You always stood your ground, always went off about what you didn\u2019t like, yet when he smiled at you the way he did, you just held an unexplanable grudge. You would never tell him what it was about and he would easily take it away and charm his way into being as playful and affectionate as always.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a bad friend. He was far from that. He was the perfect friend if that existed. He had his flaws, but the good parts always shined. He was even an amazing person that a lot of people looked up to and you could see why. Yet when you get to know one person, you get to know more of the flaws, the cracks, the insecurities. All of it.</p><p>\u201cYo, Y/N! Jesus christ, how hard are you zoning out?\u201d Jimin laughed at your face as he waved his hand in front of your eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJimin\u201d You let out a breath you didn\u2019t know you were holding. You smiled at the sane sight of your good friend and ex-boyfriend.\u00a0\u201cSorry\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s serious if you are zoning out this hard,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cLast time you zoned out like this was when we broke up. Then you broke down, kissed me and smiled like a psycho\u201d<br></p><p>You rolled your eyes at him.\u00a0\u201cTwo years ago. It was a whole two years ago, Jimin\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were too mad at Joon to come\u201d He nudged your shoulder teasingly.<br></p><p>If one person knew you entirely like an open book, it was Jimin. It was admirable how you two never kept secrets. Even with Namjoon, you two weren\u2019t completely transparent. That is how Jimin and Y/N have always been. Raw, honest, stripped down. That\u2019s why your relationship ended so smoothly. You worked better as good friends and you both knew it, so you made the mutual decision. As if it was possible, you became even more close from that day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah well\u2026 He called\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust like that\u201d He nodded.\u00a0\u201cHave you really become this soft for him?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI guess\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI even brought him food because he said he was hungry,\u201d You said, shaking your head as you looked down at your boots.<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s locked in the closet next to Jungkook\u2019s room,\u201d He told you.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very aware\u201d You nodded and laughed.\u00a0\u201cWhy did they do it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know how the two babies love to fuck with Joon when he\u2019s drunk. He\u2019s vulnerable. They literally told him that you were in that closet, so he got in and they locked him\u201d He explained.\u00a0\u201cHe really wanted you here\u201d He looked at you, lowering his head so that he can grab your attention and make you stop looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d You shook your head and looked up, swallowing.\u00a0\u201cI just know that Jin might never get him home if he\u2019s drunk too. He\u2019ll be mad at himself if he doesn\u2019t wake up in his bed tomorrow\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care, yet you go out of your way to come all the way across town, almost at dawn to get him home safely,\u201d He said, propping his eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cOf course you don\u2019t care hun\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJiminie I-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t lie to me\u201d He stated.\u00a0\u201cYou need to tell him how you feel. I know you think it will be stupid and that he will hate you after it, but he\u2019s changed a lot ever since you made that pact to pretend to be his girlfriend so that he can get Sunmin back\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even get how people believe it,\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t even kiss!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need to see you kiss to believe it, Y/N. Everyone thought you two were dating from day one, you know that. You know why? Because of that stupid way Joon always looks at you. And I know what you\u2019re going to say.\u00a0\u2018Jimin, those stares only exist in movies and mean absolute shit!\u2019. Well if they happen only in movies, Namjoon is the perfect candidate to play in\u00a0one because he does it well\u201d He said, trying to change your mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to look weak, Jimin,\u201d You said.<br></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head in confusion.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry but when did expressing your feelings make you look weak? It makes you <i>honest</i>. I thought you knew how to do that, I thought you were done with being fake\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it,\u201d You said, crossing your arms in front of your chest.\u00a0\u201cAt least not today. Not until I am sure\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou will be sure when you end up with seven cats that you will name after us when you turn 70\u2033 He laughed and ruffled your hair.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBetter late than never\u201d You shrugged.<br></p><p>He rolled his eyes at you and giggled, swinging his arm around your shoulders. He placed a kiss on the top of your head and squeezed you tightly against him in reassurance.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get you inside. You\u2019re never going to make it upstairs without me. If I let you go alone, you might just end up in a jail cell for punching someone to death\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my hate for drunk teenagers dancing at parties too obvious?\u201d You asked as you took your first steps towards the apartment entrance.<br></p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re sober it is. When you are drunk, you are the annoyance itself\u2019 He teased you with a wide smirk.<br></p><p>\u201cHey! I like to party, but by my own rules\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cYou always are so bossy. Maybe that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t work out. You really do need Joon to dick you down and dom your whiny ass\u201d He smirked harder.<br></p><p>You punched his shoulder and laughed.\u00a0\u201cI really hate you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby!\u201d He yelled over the music.<br></p><p>The moment you walked inside and Jimin released you from his embrace to hold your hand and walk in front of you to protect you, a lot of eyes were definitely on you. Or most likely, your bottom half. You really went the route of wearing the skirt Joon told you to wear just to mess him up a little. You received a few quick greetings from Hoseok and Yoongi, Hoseok drunk dancing on top of the coffee table in the living room along with Jin and Jimin helped you pass through the crowd to walk into the kitchen where he knew Jungkook and Taehyung would be, filling up their cups with more alcohol.</p><p>As soon as Jimin released his grip from your hand and you walked in front of your two friends, they stopped drinking, their eyes as wide as an owl\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cWhich one of you fuckers had the brilliant idea?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook gulped down and stuttered.\u00a0\u201cI- I uh I didn\u2019t! It was Taehyung!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d Taehyung exlcaimed and hit Jungkook on his chest.\u00a0\u201cIt was your idea. I don\u2019t want my balls cut off by Y/N. I want to have chldren. You\u2019re doomed to never find a wife, I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole, I swear to god\u201d Jungkook rolled his eyes at Taehyung. As amusing as it was to hear them argue, trying to cover up their little plan, you wanted to get to the point.<br></p><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d You asked.<br></p><p>\u201cAn hour? I think more. He might have died\u201d Jungkook said.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a dick and it is a proven fact from now on. Brilliant idea, never do it without me again. But do it for a good reason!\u201d You protested.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t go around and push my relationship with Joon like that. It\u2019s uncalled for\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to fuck with him, I\u2019m sorry\u201d Jungkook pouted.<br></p><p>\u201cNext time you want to know something about us two, just ask me and don\u2019t manipulate Joon. Because I know you did it to prove a point\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cWhich is that Joon wants your babies,\u201d Taehyung said.\u00a0\u201cHe called you, mission accomplished. Just date for real, it\u2019s tiring\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s not tiring for me either?!\u201d You yelled out of frustration.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not having the best day. He was rambling on the phone and I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. I\u2019m going to go get him\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRelax. You\u2019re just taking him home\u201d Jimin said as you walked out of the kitchen.<br></p><p>\u201cI know\u201d You let out a sigh.\u00a0\u201cYou can go now\u201d You smiled at him.<br></p><p>\u201cText me if anything happens\u201d He kissed your cheek one last time and left you be.<br></p><p>You took in a deep breath and quickly walked up the stairs. Namjoon was the only one that hadn\u2019t noticed your feelings at this point. Every one of the boys and your girl friends knew. They were also the only people that knew your relationship was just staged. He was such a smart person, his intelligence and his way of understanding everyone around him was admirable, nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t decipher your mind entirely and it drove you insane. You just wished he could see it with his own eyes, make his conclusion and ask you if it is true. The thought of uttering those words to him was simply terrifying.</p><p>Your feet navigated you through the apartment and you knew exactly where that closet was. You remember back a year ago when you were at another party of Jungkook\u2019s. You played Seven Minutes In Heaven. Even if you found it childish, the two vodkas and one shot of tequila in your system, told your brain it would be fun. Namjoon and Hoseok had sent you and Jimin inside this closet because they thought it was a bad idea that you two broke up. You remember Hoseok\u2019s words exactly.\u00a0<i>\u2018Come on you idiots, you still undress each other with those eyes!\u2019</i></p><p><i>Drunk Hoseok never makes sense</i>, you thought. You giggled at the memory of you and Jimin walking inside, being locked in and ending up cracking up. You wanted to make the others think you were actually making out, so you threw a few moans and names here and there. Both of you were sure most of the people playing the game would have their ears on the wood of the door to listen to what was going on. Unfortunately, you blew your plan when Jimin started tickling you and you started laughing hysterically.</p><p>The corners of your lips curled up into a small smile, however, it quickly fell off your pink stained lips and formed a small frown as you prepared yourself to unlock the door to the closet. You had to do this and you had to be cold and quick with it. No having fun, there are limits in your actions. At least there should be, even if you keep them or not.</p><p>You twisted the golden key Jungkook had given you and unlocked the door, opening it slowly. You turned the lights on, which were off the whole time and Namjoon squinted his eyes, hissing.\u00a0\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d You told him, your arms crossed in front of your chest.<br></p><p>He opened his eyes and stood up carefully, his palm on the wall to help him steady his vulnerable drunken state.\u00a0\u201cYou took your sweet time coming here\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widened as you realized, his hair was no longer black. His smooth black hair has suddenly become a dirty blond colour, which somehow complimented his recently tanned skin tone perfectly.\u00a0\u201cYou- You\u2019re blond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d He grinned widely.\u00a0\u201cWe made a bet with the guys! So I did it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, you are such an idiot\u201d You rolled your eyes and breathed in, taking a whiff of a terrible smell. You squinted your eyes in disgust and pinched your nose with your index finger and your thumb.\u00a0\u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, you took your sweet time. I couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer!\u201d He whined.<br></p><p>\u201cOh my god, did you seriously pee in the bucket?\u201d You asked, surprised.<br></p><p>\u201cWanna see?\u201d He asked.<br></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here. The ones who started this mess in the first place can handle it\u201d<br></p><p>Namjoon giggled and as soon as he walked out, you locked the closet again and pushed Namjoon towards the bathroom across the hall.\u00a0\u201cFirst you clean your hands and then we can leave\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act worse than my mother, Jesus Y/N\u201d He rolled his eyes. He did as you said and proceeded to clean his face with some water. Surprisingly enough, he could walk perfectly even if he is drunk. Maybe, just maybe the alcohol was starting to wear off of him.<br></p><p><i>This is your chance Y/N. Leave him here and act as if you never came the next day. You can\u2019t let him sober up and then have him tease you for the rest of the year. What if you start talking in the car and he gets his logic back and you confess something you don\u2019t want him to know? Maybe you\u2019re being overdramatic. He can\u2019t sober up this fast.</i></p><p>You quickly gave Jungkook his key back and tried to get Namjoon out of the party. He followed you behind and you caught Jimin\u2019s stare, gesturing you to call him if anything goes wrong. So many things <i>could</i> go wrong.</p><p>You got Namjoon safely at the back seat of your black SUV and made your way to the driver\u2019s seat. You made sure to get out of the drive way as quickly as possible, not wanting to give any more attention to yourself. You don\u2019t want anyone talking about your cameo appearance in campus tomorrow. That is actually the last thing you want.</p><p>\u201cDoes it smell like food in here?\u201d He asked. He popped his head up from the back seat and his eyes darted to the recyclable Taco Bell paper bag on the passenger\u2019s seat.\u00a0\u201cYou got me food?! God, Y/N I love you\u201d His lips left a quick kiss on your cheek as he hugged you from behind. He is so lucky you are a good driver, otherwise, you could have ended up hitting a tree from his sudden display of affection.</p><p>You decided to park your car at the Taco Bell parking lot, which wasn\u2019t far from your own apartment. You parked at a secluded corner and took in a deep breath after you shut the engine off.\u00a0\u201cYou can come to the front now\u201d</p><p>Like a child getting what it wants, Namjoon climbed out of the back seat and opened the door to the passenger\u2019s seat. You took the paper bag in your hands and set it in the middle of the both of you, taking your iced tea out. The only thing that could calm you down at this point is tea. Everything else seems too uncertain to give you reassurance.</p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d Namjoon exclaimed as soon as he took the first bite out of his taco.\u00a0\u201cYou even got my favourite\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust eat and shut up,\u201d You said, taking the fries out of the bag. You put your music playlist on, the chill song that came on softly playing in the background of the silence between you and him.<br></p><p>You were surprised at how quickly he devoured all three tacos and downed his coke like it was water. You were just about done with one small fries and sipped on your last few drops of tea.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon sat back and rubbed his stomach with a smile on his face.\u00a0\u201cThanks\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d You said, looking out of the window. As you looked at the first few cars passing by so early in the morning, you felt Namjoon\u2019s hand on your thigh, playing with the edge of your skirt. His favourite skirt.\u00a0\u201cAh, look at you. You really wore it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You avoided his stare at all costs. His stare when sane and sober might be deadly, but his drunken stare is inviting and that is all the more worse. It\u2019s too easy for you to manipulate. You could steal your chance and do anything you wanted right about now. You have thought about it plenty of times, so why not do it now?\u00a0\u201cYeah. I wore it\u201d</p><p>He smiled gently, his dimples popping out of both of his cheeks as his thumb caressed the exposed skin of your thigh. He shuffled in his seat and rested his chin on your shoulder, his breath fanning your neck. A trail of goosebumps rose on your honey skin as his lips made contact with your neck. You took in a sharp shaky breath as his tongue darted out on your skin, taking you by surprise.\u00a0\u201cI need to get you home\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d He said, placing a delicate kiss. He brought your skin between his teeth and you knew this was getting too far, too fast. You wanted to savor his lips on your body as much as you could, but you knew it wasn\u2019t right. Every time he got too close, sober or not, every time he put his hands on you so innocently, you felt as if he was your Pandora\u2019s box and you felt more and more intrigued, your will rising each time he grazes your thigh, your hand, your cheek, your neck, anything.<br></p><p>You knew opening this box, this mind of his and its twisted ways that are so well masked underneath his perfectly sculpted dimples and piercing dark brown eyes would cause an avalanche of problems to fall on your already hurt shoulders, ready to collapse if more burden is put on them. It\u2019s not like your life is perfect. Your life is far from perfect. People like Namjoon just make it a little less shitty and you don\u2019t want to risk losing that.</p><p>You gently pushed Namjoon away and put your hands on the steering wheel, your knuckles turning white from the pressure you put.\u00a0\u201cEnough\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d He pouted.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to sleep\u201d You smiled gently, trying not to show too much of your anger. You turned the engine on and started driving, the familiar road towards the apartment he shares with Jin and Hoseok.</p><p>You caught him furrowing his eyebrows from the corner of your eyes, his pretty pink lips opening to speak and you waited for him to utter the first stupid thing that came into his mind, only for his actually logical question to surprise you.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you going this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to your apartment. Does alcohol make you an amnesiac as well? That\u2019s new\u201d You kept your eyes focused on the road as the first few cars of people going to work have started making their way into the road.<br></p><p>\u201cI thought I was coming with you. It would be better not to show up like this in the apartment, right?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cI think Hoseok\u2019s girlfriend will be over too\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, so I have to baby you for the rest of the day?\u201d You raised your eyebrow at him. He parted his lips to speak, not knowing how to respond and you shook your head.\u00a0\u201cThis is a one-time thing\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve slept in your apartment before,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cI mean you, drunk, in my apartment. It\u2019s not happening again\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cIt made everyone see how my girlfriend cares about me though\u201d He smiled and giggled, pressing a light kiss on your shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cHa, funny Namjoon. Funny\u201d You let out a cold laugh as you turned and pulled into your neighborhood. Your regular parking spot waited for your car to be placed perfectly in front of the door of your apartment, something that always made your perfectionist side feel the most satisfaction it can possibly feel.<br></p><p>At this point, Namjoon was able to walk towards your apartment at his own accord and strengh, which you were grateful for. A few more minutes and he could sober up. You can see he is in this sleepy state that if you keep him up for too long, he might just puke the alcohol out and be himself again.</p><p>You practically forced him to sleep on the couch as you didn\u2019t want to wake up next to him in the morning and have to face him. He whined for a few minutes until he passed out. You tucked him in and made your way towards the bathroom to change back into your comfortable pajamas. Even if you felt tired, you tossed and turned on the couch, bothered by the whole situation and finding it unbearable to just let it go. You overthought and analyzed every single day. This night was no different, but it was way more intense.</p><p><i>You need to get over him and stop this madness, Y/N. It\u2019s slowly driving you insane,</i> you thought.</p><p>You had really started to think you had gotten over him the past few weeks. All it took to hit you into reality was this night. This sleepless night of procrastination and guilt.</p><p><b>[Sunday, 12:28 pm]</b></p><p>You stepped your foot into the small local coffee shop you and Jimin loved the bell over the door ringing, announcing your presence. You smiled gently as you saw Jimin waiting at the corner booth you always chose to sit at, two cups of cold brew latte, extra ice for you.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been waiting?\u201d You asked him as you sat down, not bothering to take your big jean jacket off. It smelled like Namjoon from yesterday, as he had decided to steal it from you at some point while he was in the back seat where you had also left your jacket.<br></p><p>Jimin pushed the cup towards you with a sweet smile and you took your first sip, gladly letting the coffee run in your veins.\u00a0\u201cNot long, I got here five minutes ago. Don\u2019t worry, all of your precious ice cubes have remained intact\u201d</p><p>You smiled like a child getting a brand new strawberry lollipop, a cute toothy smile as you took another sip. You had this weird obsession with eating ice cubes. To be honest, the most exciting part of drinking anything cold was being left with a few drops that coated the ice cubes, to give you a sweet crispy sense in your mouth.\u00a0\u201cThanks\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s lover boy doing?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>\u201cNo idea\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s probably still passed out. It was 7 am when we got back\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDamn, what took you so long? Car sex? I know Namjoon gets even more dominant when he\u2019s drunk, so how are your legs still in place?\u201d He teased you.<br></p><p>You rolled your eyes at him and curled your lips around your straw.\u00a0\u201cYour humor is especially awful today, Park Jimin. I got him food, we ate it in the parking lot and we left. What took so long was me contemplating to walk into the party in the first place\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yeah\u201d He laughed.\u00a0\u201cYou looked like a lost puppy. That\u2019s how he makes you look when you think of him\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot a good look on me, I hate not knowing shit,\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you seriously asking me? You know what, if you are asking it is actually serious\u201d He said, furrowing his eyebrows.<br></p><p>You looked around cautiously, hoping no one that knew you were looking and moved your thick choker to allow him to see the purple hickey on your neck. You weren\u2019t expecting Namjoon\u2019s playful little drunk bites to leave a hickey this dark, yet here you were wearing a choker after months.\u00a0\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Jimin said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I was wondering why you wore a choker. I thought you dropped them long ago, as they- and I quote-\u00a0\u2018aren\u2019t in fashion anymore\u2019. Can you enlighten me? Did you really eat food? Because it seems to me as if Namjoon went right to dessert\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get laid last night? Because you seem awfully cheery today\u201d You shot back.<br></p><p>\u201cYes indeed!\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cBut this is not about me here. This is about your little sexscapade with Namdaddy\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWould you stop!\u201d You laughed, sending him a death glare.\u00a0\u201cHe just\u2026 After we ate, we just sat there, my music was playing and he started being\u2026 touchy\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSounds like a regular day to me,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cHe always does that, Y/N\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe held my upper thigh, he kissed my neck and he gave me a hickey, Jimin. A freaking <i>hickey</i>\u201d You whispered but yelled at him at the same time.\u00a0\u201cI know we\u2019re always touchy but\u2026 When he called me to tell me he was locked in that closet, I told him I was getting ready and he went on to talk about me and how good my ass would look naked and how he wants to hear my singing again because it is good to him\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDamn, he went soft on you? And he still doensn\u2019t let himself see how much he likes you?\u201d He asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, Jimin. If I confront him about this, he will deny all of it. He might act all mighty and dominant but he\u2019s a coward and I don\u2019t want to risk our friendship. It\u2019s as if I had feelings for your crush and I told you\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t have him be all touchy-feely with me anymore. It adds fuel to the fire and I definitely cannot pretend to be his girlfriend any longer. He told me he kissed a random girl for beer pong and I got jealous\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d He asked, raising both of his eyebrows. He locked his jaw in place and you knew for a fact, he was about to say something big.\u00a0\u201cDid he leave out the detail that this random girl was actually Sunmin? Did he also forget to tell you that I found him in Jungkook\u2019s room, zipping his pants with Sunmin rushing out?\u201d<br></p><p>Your lips parted and your jaw dropped in surprise.\u00a0\u201cHe was lucky it was nobody else. He really risked his own stupid plan. He has Sunmin being the biggest slut out there and he\u2019s bulding himself a fuckboy title. You two really need to talk, Y/N. I don\u2019t care what exactly you will tell him, but this pact is not good for any of you\u201d</p><p>You nodded and bit your lip, breaking an ice cube with your teeth to calm you down.\u00a0\u201cHe cheated on his imaginary girlfriend and then asked for her to pick up his mess. How romantic\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was plastered and he doesn\u2019t accept his feelings. Let\u2019s be honest, the way he is handling everything, he\u2019s not going to be acting sane unless you slap some sense into him\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cTurn the tables, Y/N. Be the smart one and the one who will sooth your problems. Namjoon might be good with feelings about loving yourself, but he is definitely not good with feelings towards other people\u201d<br></p><p>You nodded again, taking the last sip of your coffee.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do with him anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe slept at my place. He slept on the bed, I slept on the couch. Well, I didn\u2019t sleep, I could only get a 30-minute nap. I woke up, got showered, dressed, wrote him a note asking him to be out of my apartment by 1 pm and drove here\u201d You said, biting down on your lip, a habit you always found solace in when you felt guilty or giddy.\u00a0\u201cI let him use the shower though\u201d<br></p><p>Jimin laughed and smiled at you, shaking his head at your cute way of trying to stay mad at Namjoon.</p><p><b>[Thursday, 17:04 pm]</b></p><p>You made your way out of your college campus, finally done with your classes for today and plugged in one of your earphones to listen to your regular music, a coping mechanism for you. Whenever your feelings get all distorted or too intense, you have found music to work the best in calming you down. Nevertheless, the song that came on shuffle in your chill playlist didn\u2019t exactly help with keeping your mind quiet.</p><p><i>Why did Ariana Grande have to make such relatable songs?!</i>, you thought.</p><p>You walked out, your feet carrying you towards the parking lot until more students started to come out and a familiar face caught your attention. You locked eyes and you cursed under your breath. This has been a confrontation you have been avoiding for as many days as you could, even if you promised Jimin you would be done with it very soon.\u00a0</p><p>Your pace quickened as you saw Namjoon walk towards you. Why did he have to wear that flowy blue and white shirt? All you want to do is take it off of him. He even paired it with a grey beanie. The things he does to you with solely his sense of fashion are incredible.</p><p><i>Focus, Y/N.</i></p><p>He picked up your pace and started walking beside you. You raised your hand with your other earphone in hand, but he caught your wrist so that you can\u2019t plug it in. He wrapped his arm around your shoulders with a smile on his face and placed a peck on your cheek.\u00a0\u201cWhere has my lovely girlfriend been the whole week while everyone was thinking how good we looked together at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing important things, now could you let me breathe? I\u2019d appreciate it\u201d You said. <i>Of course, he wants you only for this publicity stunt.</i><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been ignoring me ever since the party. What\u2019s wrong with you lately? You kick me out of your apartment with a note and then give no shits about me?\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cI thought we were on the same page here\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe are. I picked you up from the party. Isn\u2019t that enough Namjoon?\u201d You asked. He stepped in front of you and put his hands on your shoulders, stopping you from walking any further.\u00a0\u201cI need to be at work by 6\u2033<br></p><p>\u201cCall in sick,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I make a living out of that intership, I can\u2019t lie\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it,\u201d He said, snatching your phone from your hands. He unplugged your earphones, making the music stop and you saw him search for the call app.<br></p><p>\u201cHey, give it back!\u201d You protested, trying to take it away from him. Namjoon blocked your small frame by placing his arm in front of your chest and dialed the number of your work with his free hand. He put the phone next to his ear and placed his index finger in front of your plump lips to silence you.<br></p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of Y/N L/N, I\u2019m her boyfriend. Nice to meet you too. Yeah, she can\u2019t be present today as she is sick. Yeah she has the flu, you know, from all the iced drinks she has every day\u201d He laughed lightly and your eyes threw darts towards him. \u201cCareless Y/N. She\u2019s extremely sorry. Oh yes, thank you! I will tell her that. Thank you very much, have a nice day\u201d He smiled and ended the phone call. Without a warning, he shot you a cold smile as he put your phone in the back pocket of his jeans.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not getting it back until I say so. Your tricks of putting music on as a way to stop listening to me are over\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis is a violation of my privacy!\u201d You protested. He rolled his eyes from your loud demeanor and pulled you towards a hall, where nobody could hear you.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?! I don\u2019t need to talk right now Namjoon\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t whine. I scored you a sick leave from today until Sunday, be grateful\u201d He said.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a sick leave, I\u2019m not sick! You make me sick, not a disease. But you know what? You\u2019re just like a disease. You stick on people and only leave if you kill it. And that is my last solution so guess who\u2019s going to end up dead by the end of this sick leave\u201d You smiled coldly.<br></p><p>\u201cStop being a child,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cYou came to the party\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you peed in a bucket, what\u2019s your point?\u201d You asked, shrugging.<br></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows and squinted his eyes in complete confusion.\u00a0\u201cI did?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cY/N, this is not the point! You came to the party when you said you wouldn\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me and you were drunk. Unfortunately, I\u2019m the only person that you act sane around when drunk so I couldn\u2019t leave you to the others to handle. I needed to come\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened? It didn\u2019t really look good for you to show up, drag me out and then make no contact with me until today\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cAnd that song you posted on your Instagram story a couple of days ago? Better off without him? What the fuck Y/N? Everyone thinks we broke up\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo what? This doesn\u2019t look good, that doesn\u2019t look good, nothing looks good lately. Well seems like I\u2019m not good enough for the fake girlfriend part\u201d You shrugged, ignorant of his ego.\u00a0\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll fabricate a good break up story for you. Like, Namjoon breaks up with current girlfriend because he cheated on her with his ex or something like that\u201d You shot.<br></p><p>He was left dumbfounded, his lips parted as he gulped down nervously.\u00a0\u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m fabricating stories. Although I\u2019m surprised with how well everyone is hiding from me the fact that you kissed some random girl during beer pong. Maybe it was because they were plastered and have probably forgotten about my existance. They always do\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kiss anyone\u201d He lied.<br></p><p>\u201cYou called me and told me yourself, Namjoon. But I mean it\u2019s fine as long as your image is not destroyed, right?\u201d You smiled, a fake smile. You felt so done with his shit and all of his plans to keep his image clean in order to get what he wants. You could seriously punch him at this point and not be sorry for it at all.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. This is awfully confusing\u201d He shook his head.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s confusing, huh? Have you ever thought how goddamn exhausting it might be for me as well? Pretending when I\u2019m only just finding myself. It\u2019s quite of a let down when the person who helped you find yourself in the first place is the one who made you lose it in mere seconds as well\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cI- Then what the hell are you implying? That we should break up?\u201d He asked.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe might as well do. We might as well do, in all meanings. I need closure Namjoon. I don\u2019t want you in my life anymore if you\u2019re going to let me get lost in my own thoughts and guilt again. You helped me break down my walls and now you\u2019re just giving me the bricks to rebuild it\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cBut you just won\u2019t let me,\u201d You said. Your voice was getting weaker than before and you could feel your eyes water and your cheeks heat. It has been such a long time ever since you last cried and so many emotions have built inside you for the past week, that maybe giving up and accepting to talk to him wasn\u2019t the best idea for your mental stability.</p><p>You crossed your arms in front of your chest and bit your lip, trying not to let yourself slip from your own hands as you looked around for any passersby.\u00a0\u201cI never knew I made you feel this way\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, living behind a mask and building an ego as high as yours can do that, surprisingly\u201d You laughed coldly.\u00a0\u201cLet me breathe, Namjoon\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI- You can\u2019t just leave me. You have been away from me for days, isn\u2019t that enough? For me it seemed like an eternity of trying to get a minute alone with you\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Wanting to get that attention, to feel that sort of affection from someone, but he or she just gives it to anybody but you? Sucks to be you, really\u201d You said. Your anger boiled and you felt a knot tie at the pit of your stomach.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I have been neglecting your needs of being the cover for you to be a fuck up. I don\u2019t think being a fuckboy is really the image you want right now, is it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhatever you are saying makes no sense to me whatsoever\u201d He shook his head, huffing.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re acting as if we really are dating. If you want to change the rules of the pact just let me know. Did you change your mind on the no kissing policy? We can change that you know, I never understood why kissing was forbidden in the first place. Sometimes I feel like you are in love with me or something\u201d He snorted.</p><p>You burst out laughing, not able to hold it in anymore. Doesn\u2019t he understand how badly he has damaged himself? How much his plan has changed him. He can\u2019t even think properly anymore. All he does is lie and deny each and every one of his mistakes.\u00a0\u201cDo you really think lying will get you anywhere? I am doing you a favor here Namjoon. A bloody favor is what leaving you is. You got what you wanted, you got Sunmin back. You never even lost her, you always had her and that is why it was so easy to get her into bed with you. I\u2019m only an obstacle for you now\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try to lie about it anymore. Jimin told me he walked in on you after you were done, in Jungkook\u2019s bedroom\u201d You said.<br></p><p>He closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, streching his hands at the back of his head. He hit his fist on the wall out of frustration.\u00a0\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so frustrated for? You were planning to keep it a secret from me forever?\u201d You asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on letting that happen in the first place. I wasn\u2019t planning on getting shit faced either, you know. But that\u2019s who I am when you\u2019re not there. Having to baby your drunk ass is way more fun you know\u201d He smiled, guilt in his smile.\u00a0\u201cSleeping with Sunmin was\u2026 it was just as if I had sex just to not be frustrated anymore, but look what I did now! I thought that if I slept with her I would get my head back in the game and stop wanting to mess everything up, but it made it worse\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you frustrated for, exactly? Your life is freaking perfect! You have so many amazing friends, you have girls running behind you all the time, Sunmin never stopped wanting to be the slut she is with you\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cNot to brag, but you also got the priviledge of making me feel bad. I\u2019ve kind of heard making Y/N feel like a waste of life is very fun. Sunmin knows that\u201d<br></p><p>He took in a deep breath and nodded to himself.\u00a0\u201cI thought she had changed\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t change just like that, Joon. And they definitely do not regret their actions easily if they have an ego as big as hers\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cYou know, I only agreed to this pact because I thought it would take no time for it to be over with. Just a sweet little torture. Since Sunmin hates my guts, I thought she would get mad and want you back right away. I also only want to see you happy, which is what she made you feel like. I thought she changed myself, I thought she started becoming a better person, but the fact that she slept with you at that party, the party she knew for a fact I wasn\u2019t going, means she hasn\u2019t changed one bit. She keeps hurting me even after two years and now she made you hurt me too\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, let me speak. I have the <i>right </i>to speak\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI never understood why you dated her in the first place. You were the one to pull me out of the hole she threw me in and I thought you were on my side. The angry one. But then you told me you met her, talked to her at a party and you thought she seemed nice. It was a year after she hurt me. Naturally, the stupid girl I am, I believed you. Only because I missed her. It is true that you can be mad at someone and miss them at the same time, Namjoon. You two just seem to get that out of me. She made you happy when you dated and I felt as if\u2026 as if this girl\u2019s purpose was to just take away from me all I love, constantly. She was my best friend. Then she took that away from me and she also took you from me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let her take me,\u201d He said, shaking his head.\u00a0\u201cI- I acted like I was naive\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou were\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cBut she has that power, to seem as if she has changed and then turn into the two-faced person she is. I agreed to the pact because I thought I would finally get my best friend back. Yet she still seemed to be the only thing you talked about. We never talked about me anymore and I had to take care of myself on my own. But I also got so obsessed with playing your girlfriend and making sure you were happy that I forgot what I actually wanted\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s worse than you think it is, Y/N. I- Sunmin just helped me open my eyes but you know that sometimes I get lost too. Sometimes I am selfish and put myself first. I thought that if I got back with her maybe everything would be normal again\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou should have told me, Namjoon. You know for a fact that just because I have depression, just because I used to want to end it all doesn\u2019t mean I am some delicate flower. You can talk to me. You can tell me how you feel\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI am even more mad at you for not opening up\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I talked to you, I would have lost you\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI saw how eager you were into helping me get Sunmin back, I got it as a message that that is all you wanted. For me to date someone else. I kind of used you in a way. I did initially want Sunmin back but falling into the routine of acting as if we were together felt good and for a moment I forgot about her. It felt\u2026 refreshing to not be suffocated with the thought of her. Because that\u2019s how it feels when I\u2019m with you. You know that feeling? When sometimes, when things are a certain way, it feels as if everything has fallen into place?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know how it feels\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t think you are healthy for me anymore, Namjoon. Jimin thinks that too. Everyone can see it, besides you\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCan see what?\u201d He asked, clueless over the fact that you are head over heels for your own best friend.<br></p><p>\u201cThat-\u201d You took in a deep breath.\u00a0\u201cJimin told me\u2026 He told me that everyone can see how we feel about one another but us. He said you have that\u00a0\u2018look\u2019 on your face. That look someone has when they are whipped for someone. The look that always makes you smile when we watch KDramas together. When the guy looks at the girl with hearts in his eyes or whatever\u201d<br></p><p>He laughed lightly and nodded, licking his lips.\u00a0\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I know?! I\u2019m just a naive girl that- never mind. Let\u2019s leave it at that\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cI want to change something in our rules for the pact,\u201d He said, clearing his throat. The moment you thought he understood you, he brought up the pact again.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 What?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI want to erase the no kissing rule,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Your eyes widened.<br></p><p>\u201cI want to know\u2026\u201d He took a step further.\u00a0\u201cI want to confirm how whipped I am\u201d He smiled cheekily. His dimples popped, perfectly carved into both of his cheeks as always. He held your chin with his index finger and as your eyes were locked on his lips, you forgot what he even told you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay stop\u201d You shook your head, seeing as this was getting out of hand.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t be touching me like this anymore!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? Like what? Did you hear what I told you?\u201d He asked.<br></p><p>\u201cLike - like we\u2019re an item! Or you can\u2019t look at me like you want to undress me and eat me for dessert. And when I told you I don\u2019t want you drunk around me anymore, I meant it! You told me you wanted to see me naked and you can\u2019t do that!\u201d You started stomping up and down in front of him, trying to shake away the thought of his lips. His lips on your neck, his hand on your thigh, his eyes sinking into yours and your skin melting under his fingertips.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be getting over you!\u201d</p><p>Namjoon raised his brows and laughed.\u00a0\u201cDid you just think out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I- No!\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m playing the fake girlfriend\u201d You lied.\u00a0\u201cAs the fake girlfriend, I think you are a bad kisser so I don\u2019t want to kiss you\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know, Jimin is right. We\u2019re goddamn blind and in your case, you are deaf too\u201d He said. Namjoon took your hands and stopped you in front of him for what seemed like the tenth time today.<br></p><p>\u201cExcuse you! My senses are great!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYet when I told you I want to see how whipped I am for you, you hear nothing\u201d He giggled.<br></p><p>Your lips parted and you looked at him dumbfounded.\u00a0\u201cUh\u2026 what? Pft! Of course, I heard that. God, you\u2019re such a good actor\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod Y/N, stop it\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cAnswer this question for me. Why in the world, when you have all you want in front of you, you just let it go? You always put others first. Be a little selfish and <i>kiss me</i>\u201d<br></p><p>For a moment you thought you were hallucinating for real. You thought you were dreaming or reading one of your own awful works. But it was him, right in front of you, asking you to break the number one rule you had set months ago. You\u2019ve never wanted to be a rebel more in your life and you took your chance. You grabbed the collar of his shirt and crashed his lips against yours. You stood on your tip toes, the height difference between the two of you immense. A smile formed on Namjoon\u2019s lips but it didn\u2019t break the kiss, it even made it better.</p><p>He grabbed your waist and lifted you up. You wrapped your legs around his waist and he secured you by pushing you against the maroon brick wall. It is one thing to imagine how kissing him would feel like and another how it actually felt in reality. No, kissing him didn\u2019t seem like a dream. It felt like it completed all that has been happening for years now. Like it justified how you acted with one another.</p><p>You smiled throughout the kiss and were eventually the one to break it, as you giggled from the fact that Namjoon had to lift you up so you could kiss.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I couldn\u2019t help it. Jesus Christ, I can\u2019t even reach your face Joon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tiny and I love it\u201d He smirked.<br></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d You pouted.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t act as if this saved everything. You have a lot to make up for\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMhm. I know\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cBut I have four days of you to myself to fix it since you don\u2019t have to go to work\u201d His lips pulled into a cheeky grin and you playfully smacked his arm.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d You said. He looked down at you, caressing your cheek with his thumb. He placed a strand of hair behind your ear and his eyes traveled towards your neck.</p><p>\u201cHa. Seems like the hickey I gave you wasn\u2019t that bad anyway. I should make up for that\u201d He said.<br></p><p>Your eyes widened at his words. How did he know that he gave you a hickey?\u00a0\u201cDid- How do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that all I did after we ate, was of my own accord\u201d<br></p><hr><p><b><a href=\"https://evasthoughtplace.tumblr.com/post/174789672548/masterlist-bts\">Masterlist</a></b></p><p><i>Dedicated to my babes: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4-K_poMzR3fbfh0_Tf6ig\">@gukkmeup</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9lbRVplFQzzK-YVZ_tTerQ\">@introjinnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLP_jnUZaduXd_j_Ln32ZQ\">@hobi-stole-my-heart</a></i></p></p>",

Some things are based on my own life, my own feelings, and relationships. I hope I delivered with this story!</i></p><hr><p><b>[Saturday, 04:53 am]</b></p><p>Your fingers trailed over the black keyboard of your laptop as you typed in meaningless words, saving each and every one on your Word. Your eyes flew to the clock at the bottom of your laptop screen and it read 04:53 am. You sighed at the time and how fast it had passed by, but continued regardless. This was your Saturday night, most of them were like this. Even most of your normal days ended up like this. You sitting on your bed with your laptop on your legs, only the light from the screen illuminating your face, your headphones plugged in to keep any sound away.</p>[[MORE]]<p>A strand of hair fell in the middle of your face and you blew it off only for it to fall back down. You placed it behind your ear and continued your work, only for another distraction to pop up. Your phone buzzed beside you, the screen opening. Your eyes darted to it and as soon as you saw Namjoon\u2019s image displayed, you picked it up, eyebrows scrunched together in confusion.</p><p>You just stared at the screen for a mere second, contemplating on whether you should pick up or not. You were already boiling at him having the nerve to call so late at night. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be at a party right now? You were more than sure he had invited you as well, on Wednesday, and you had turned him down because you were mad at him. It was Jungkook\u2019s party but he would understand. Now Namjoon, on the other hand, was just as pissed as you were, as his own best friend turned him down.</p><p>You rolled your eyes and sighed, swiping right.\u00a0\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N! Babe, finally! What took you so long?\u201d He asked. His voice sounded huskier than usual.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d You asked, coldly.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy so harsh? I\u2019m hurt\u201d He said and laughed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m drunk\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks for telling me? If this is a stupid drunk call, then you\u2019re wasting my time\u201d You told him.<br></p><p>\u201cThe boys were asking for you. I\u2019m at the party you were supposed to come, remember?\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cBut of course, you had better things to do than to hang out with your best friend\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy hanging out, you mean trying to play matchmaker so that you can get back with Sunmin? No thanks, Joon. I\u2019ll pass this time and all the other times you want me to get her to be jealous for you\u201d\u00a0 You went off. You knew this wasn\u2019t the right time to talk to him about your thoughts, yet you also knew that you weren\u2019t going to find any courage to do this while he was sober.<br></p><p>\u201cI wanted <i>you</i> here, I invited <i>you</i>, not her. If I wanted to invite her, I would have done it\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cJungkook and Taehyung locked me in a closet\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThey- What? Why?\u201d You asked, laughing.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh! I can barely see!\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cI have no idea\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, well. Bye\u201d You said, ready to hang up.<br></p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He yelled.\u00a0\u201cCome get me. I\u2019m drunk, remember?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a child. Jin will drive you home\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cI want you! Y/N, my baby girl. Just come to daddy, dammit!\u201d He said.<br></p><p>You chuckled and shut off your laptop.\u00a0\u201cYou are shit drunk, Joon. I\u2019m only coming because you\u2019re stupid when you\u2019re drunk and it doesn\u2019t happen often\u201d</p><p>\u201cI are not stupid!\u201d He complained.</p><p>\u201cWow, apparently you forget your grammar too,\u201d You said, putting him on speaker so that you can throw some clothes on. You can\u2019t show up at a party with literally your underwear and a robe around you. You couldn\u2019t give less shit about how you looked, but you didn\u2019t want to go practically naked. <i>Although most of the whores there are naked at this point.</i><br></p><p>You heard a loud thud from the other line, more than sure Namjoon has hit his head somewhere. Somehow, he is even more clumsy when he is drunk. If you don\u2019t show up in the next twenty minutes, he could even set the closet on fire without knowing how he did it.\u00a0\u201cI hit my head\u201d He announced as if you hadn\u2019t just heard.\u00a0\u201cTalk to me!\u201d He whined.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and stay still. I\u2019m getting dressed to come there\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d He said, his tone lower.\u00a0\u201cYou could always come naked, you know? It\u2019s always a sight to see you in your underwear, it will be even better with no clothes. I bet. Wear that dark blue skirt you have, you know, the one that always makes your ass pop even more and has everyone wondering how better it might be exposed\u201d<br></p><p>You almost choked at your own spit at his sudden reveal. You didn\u2019t know people had that opinion for you and what was more surprising was Namjoon\u2019s opinion about you. <i>He\u2019s drunk and talking nonsense</i>, you thought.\u00a0\u201cYou really are a piece of work. And I thought you would be more responsible alone at a party. Usually, I am the one who gets drunk and you are the one who drags me home, you know\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you leave me alone?\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m useless\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI told you not to get drunk,\u201d You said, putting your combat boots on. You laced them up and fixed your hair in the mirror, letting your natural soft curls fall down your shoulders- but reaching just there and not longer. You loved having your hair short. It wasn\u2019t exactly a bob and it wasn\u2019t considered long either. The length was just perfect. When you shot the idea that you wanted to cut your hair to your friends, they kept telling you how you should leave your hair get even longer because it suits you. Long dark hair, for a petite curvy figure in her 20s. Fits just right for their stereotypes.<br></p><p>But not for you. You\u2019ve wanted this for so long. You still felt so great about your decision and everyone complimented you despite knowing that they don\u2019t like it as much. It made you feel more like yourself, it gave you a sense of confidence no one could understand but you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny\u201d Namjoon interrupted your train of thoughts. You stopped looking at yourself in the mirror and grabbed your phone from your bed.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s funny how you acted all mad when you declined my invite to come to this party, yet you still cared for me enough to tell me not to get drunk. You\u2019re such an idiot, you can\u2019t even hide that you cannot stay mad at me entirely\u201d<br></p><p>You stopped in your tracks and looked at your phone with a grudge as if he could see you from the other side. You opened your mouth to protest against his claim, but you knew nothing you said would be true. He\u2019s drunk, he won\u2019t remember any of what you say tomorrow anyway.\u00a0\u201cShut up. I like it more when you are sober because you know how to lie and pretend\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d You said and grabbed your keys before stepping out of your apartment to walk to your car. You wrapped your palm around the handle of the driver\u2019s door after unlocking it and opened it, stepping inside. You fastened your seatbelt securely and placed your phone on the passenger\u2019s seat, Namjoon still on speaker. You pressed a few buttons and played your favourite Spotify playlist to drive at night.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAh. There she is. Y/N and her careful driving while listening to music depending on her mood and the time of day\u201d Namjoon said and a small smile formed on your lips at his attention to detail.\u00a0\u201cI never tell you this, but I\u2019m kind of jealous of how good of a driver you are. So careful, mind set. Yet careless at the same time as you play your music and sing along at times. Sometimes you even sing when we talk on the phone and you think that I can\u2019t listen to you, but I do and damn what I would do to listen to that again and again\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you know?\u201d You said, facepalming yourself as you drove out of your neighborhood.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI do\u201d He laughed drunkenly.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful though. At the other hand, my driving is awful\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI second that\u201d You laughed.\u00a0\u201cWhat I like is that drunk, you are as eager to talk as when you are while sober\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, I could talk for ages,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cWith you especially\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d You said as you turned to a corner. You sighed as you spotted the Taco Bell drive through and drove towards the line. Who are you kidding, there is no line at this time. It\u2019s after 5 am.\u00a0\u201cHold on,\u201d You told Namjoon as you pulled at the drive through and placed your finger over the speaker so that he doesn\u2019t hear you order.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHello, what would you like to order?\u201d The man asked from the speaker.<br></p><p>\u201cHi, can I get three chicken soft tacos, one small fries, one diet coke, and an unsweetened ice tea? Thanks\u201d You ordered and drove a little further. You kept your finger on your speaker until it was time to collect your order and hoped that Namjoon wouldn\u2019t listen. You paid and thanked the cashier quietly, getting no weird looks, surprisingly.<br></p><p>People are too used to drunk teenagers eating at this time. You placed the bag on the passenger\u2019s seat and left your phone right beside it.\u00a0\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUgh, are you here yet? I\u2019m bored. This party was boring enough without you. Also, I hope nobody saw me wink at Sunmin and then kiss a random girl in beer pong\u201d He giggled.<br></p><p>Your lips formed a straight line as you let the silence fall to collect your thoughts. He kissed a random girl, during a game. You told yourself you were over this stupid crush of yours on your very own guy best friend, yet at the mention of him touching, talking to or kissing another person still made the unsettling feeling in your stomach appear.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m almost there. Almost\u201d You sighed.</p><p>\u201cGreat because I need to pee too,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cWhat if I pee in this bucket? It fell on me when I hit my head, might as well use it!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNamjoon, no!\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t pee in that bucket you asshole\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need to!\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cDo not do it. Jungkook will be pissed\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cAs if I care what baby Jungkook thinks,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cJoonie\u2026\u201d You sighed, knowing how to get him to stop.<br></p><p>\u201cFine\u201d He groaned and you heard him sit back down on the floor. You parked a few meters away from Jungkook\u2019s apartment and took your seatbelt off. You took your phone in your hand and pressed the middle button for it to open.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there in a second. Don\u2019t do anything stupid and piss me off more okay?\u201d You told him.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. You behave as well. No touching others, no grinding over anyone\u2019s dick and no sucking anyone\u2019s di-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJoon! Shut the hell up and let me come take your drunk ass home\u201d You said and ended the call from the rage that he built so quickly. You got off your car, locked it and put your phone in the pocket of your big jean jacket. You stood in front of the bustling apartment, surprised at the number of people still there. You took in a deep breath and a few thoughts popped in your head.<br></p><p>Why are you doing this? You told yourself you were over with his crap. He has been on and off with you lately and yet acts as if nothing has changed. He has used you as a pawn to get back with his ex-girlfriend, that you got him to date in the first place. He hasn\u2019t had time for you lately either, he has always been hanging out with the boys. You were totally fine with them, you were friends with them as well but he has been making up excuses and canceling plans too many times in the duration of the past three months. And it wasn\u2019t only that, he was still touchy feely with you. Even after he broke up, he likes to play with how you react.</p><p>He has let himself turn into who he never wanted to be and you didn\u2019t know the reason why. He wouldn\u2019t tell you and you couldn\u2019t find the courage to talk to him about it either. You were always a confrontatial person, but in his case, he made you feel weak. You felt like putty in his hands, easy to manipulate. You always stood your ground, always went off about what you didn\u2019t like, yet when he smiled at you the way he did, you just held an unexplanable grudge. You would never tell him what it was about and he would easily take it away and charm his way into being as playful and affectionate as always.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a bad friend. He was far from that. He was the perfect friend if that existed. He had his flaws, but the good parts always shined. He was even an amazing person that a lot of people looked up to and you could see why. Yet when you get to know one person, you get to know more of the flaws, the cracks, the insecurities. All of it.</p><p>\u201cYo, Y/N! Jesus christ, how hard are you zoning out?\u201d Jimin laughed at your face as he waved his hand in front of your eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJimin\u201d You let out a breath you didn\u2019t know you were holding. You smiled at the sane sight of your good friend and ex-boyfriend.\u00a0\u201cSorry\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s serious if you are zoning out this hard,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cLast time you zoned out like this was when we broke up. Then you broke down, kissed me and smiled like a psycho\u201d<br></p><p>You rolled your eyes at him.\u00a0\u201cTwo years ago. It was a whole two years ago, Jimin\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were too mad at Joon to come\u201d He nudged your shoulder teasingly.<br></p><p>If one person knew you entirely like an open book, it was Jimin. It was admirable how you two never kept secrets. Even with Namjoon, you two weren\u2019t completely transparent. That is how Jimin and Y/N have always been. Raw, honest, stripped down. That\u2019s why your relationship ended so smoothly. You worked better as good friends and you both knew it, so you made the mutual decision. As if it was possible, you became even more close from that day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah well\u2026 He called\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust like that\u201d He nodded.\u00a0\u201cHave you really become this soft for him?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI guess\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI even brought him food because he said he was hungry,\u201d You said, shaking your head as you looked down at your boots.<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s locked in the closet next to Jungkook\u2019s room,\u201d He told you.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very aware\u201d You nodded and laughed.\u00a0\u201cWhy did they do it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know how the two babies love to fuck with Joon when he\u2019s drunk. He\u2019s vulnerable. They literally told him that you were in that closet, so he got in and they locked him\u201d He explained.\u00a0\u201cHe really wanted you here\u201d He looked at you, lowering his head so that he can grab your attention and make you stop looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d You shook your head and looked up, swallowing.\u00a0\u201cI just know that Jin might never get him home if he\u2019s drunk too. He\u2019ll be mad at himself if he doesn\u2019t wake up in his bed tomorrow\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care, yet you go out of your way to come all the way across town, almost at dawn to get him home safely,\u201d He said, propping his eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cOf course you don\u2019t care hun\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJiminie I-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t lie to me\u201d He stated.\u00a0\u201cYou need to tell him how you feel. I know you think it will be stupid and that he will hate you after it, but he\u2019s changed a lot ever since you made that pact to pretend to be his girlfriend so that he can get Sunmin back\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even get how people believe it,\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t even kiss!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need to see you kiss to believe it, Y/N. Everyone thought you two were dating from day one, you know that. You know why? Because of that stupid way Joon always looks at you. And I know what you\u2019re going to say.\u00a0\u2018Jimin, those stares only exist in movies and mean absolute shit!\u2019. Well if they happen only in movies, Namjoon is the perfect candidate to play in\u00a0one because he does it well\u201d He said, trying to change your mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to look weak, Jimin,\u201d You said.<br></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head in confusion.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry but when did expressing your feelings make you look weak? It makes you <i>honest</i>. I thought you knew how to do that, I thought you were done with being fake\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it,\u201d You said, crossing your arms in front of your chest.\u00a0\u201cAt least not today. Not until I am sure\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou will be sure when you end up with seven cats that you will name after us when you turn 70\u2033 He laughed and ruffled your hair.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBetter late than never\u201d You shrugged.<br></p><p>He rolled his eyes at you and giggled, swinging his arm around your shoulders. He placed a kiss on the top of your head and squeezed you tightly against him in reassurance.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get you inside. You\u2019re never going to make it upstairs without me. If I let you go alone, you might just end up in a jail cell for punching someone to death\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my hate for drunk teenagers dancing at parties too obvious?\u201d You asked as you took your first steps towards the apartment entrance.<br></p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re sober it is. When you are drunk, you are the annoyance itself\u2019 He teased you with a wide smirk.<br></p><p>\u201cHey! I like to party, but by my own rules\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cYou always are so bossy. Maybe that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t work out. You really do need Joon to dick you down and dom your whiny ass\u201d He smirked harder.<br></p><p>You punched his shoulder and laughed.\u00a0\u201cI really hate you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby!\u201d He yelled over the music.<br></p><p>The moment you walked inside and Jimin released you from his embrace to hold your hand and walk in front of you to protect you, a lot of eyes were definitely on you. Or most likely, your bottom half. You really went the route of wearing the skirt Joon told you to wear just to mess him up a little. You received a few quick greetings from Hoseok and Yoongi, Hoseok drunk dancing on top of the coffee table in the living room along with Jin and Jimin helped you pass through the crowd to walk into the kitchen where he knew Jungkook and Taehyung would be, filling up their cups with more alcohol.</p><p>As soon as Jimin released his grip from your hand and you walked in front of your two friends, they stopped drinking, their eyes as wide as an owl\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cWhich one of you fuckers had the brilliant idea?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook gulped down and stuttered.\u00a0\u201cI- I uh I didn\u2019t! It was Taehyung!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d Taehyung exlcaimed and hit Jungkook on his chest.\u00a0\u201cIt was your idea. I don\u2019t want my balls cut off by Y/N. I want to have chldren. You\u2019re doomed to never find a wife, I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole, I swear to god\u201d Jungkook rolled his eyes at Taehyung. As amusing as it was to hear them argue, trying to cover up their little plan, you wanted to get to the point.<br></p><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d You asked.<br></p><p>\u201cAn hour? I think more. He might have died\u201d Jungkook said.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a dick and it is a proven fact from now on. Brilliant idea, never do it without me again. But do it for a good reason!\u201d You protested.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t go around and push my relationship with Joon like that. It\u2019s uncalled for\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to fuck with him, I\u2019m sorry\u201d Jungkook pouted.<br></p><p>\u201cNext time you want to know something about us two, just ask me and don\u2019t manipulate Joon. Because I know you did it to prove a point\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cWhich is that Joon wants your babies,\u201d Taehyung said.\u00a0\u201cHe called you, mission accomplished. Just date for real, it\u2019s tiring\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s not tiring for me either?!\u201d You yelled out of frustration.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not having the best day. He was rambling on the phone and I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. I\u2019m going to go get him\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRelax. You\u2019re just taking him home\u201d Jimin said as you walked out of the kitchen.<br></p><p>\u201cI know\u201d You let out a sigh.\u00a0\u201cYou can go now\u201d You smiled at him.<br></p><p>\u201cText me if anything happens\u201d He kissed your cheek one last time and left you be.<br></p><p>You took in a deep breath and quickly walked up the stairs. Namjoon was the only one that hadn\u2019t noticed your feelings at this point. Every one of the boys and your girl friends knew. They were also the only people that knew your relationship was just staged. He was such a smart person, his intelligence and his way of understanding everyone around him was admirable, nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t decipher your mind entirely and it drove you insane. You just wished he could see it with his own eyes, make his conclusion and ask you if it is true. The thought of uttering those words to him was simply terrifying.</p><p>Your feet navigated you through the apartment and you knew exactly where that closet was. You remember back a year ago when you were at another party of Jungkook\u2019s. You played Seven Minutes In Heaven. Even if you found it childish, the two vodkas and one shot of tequila in your system, told your brain it would be fun. Namjoon and Hoseok had sent you and Jimin inside this closet because they thought it was a bad idea that you two broke up. You remember Hoseok\u2019s words exactly.\u00a0<i>\u2018Come on you idiots, you still undress each other with those eyes!\u2019</i></p><p><i>Drunk Hoseok never makes sense</i>, you thought. You giggled at the memory of you and Jimin walking inside, being locked in and ending up cracking up. You wanted to make the others think you were actually making out, so you threw a few moans and names here and there. Both of you were sure most of the people playing the game would have their ears on the wood of the door to listen to what was going on. Unfortunately, you blew your plan when Jimin started tickling you and you started laughing hysterically.</p><p>The corners of your lips curled up into a small smile, however, it quickly fell off your pink stained lips and formed a small frown as you prepared yourself to unlock the door to the closet. You had to do this and you had to be cold and quick with it. No having fun, there are limits in your actions. At least there should be, even if you keep them or not.</p><p>You twisted the golden key Jungkook had given you and unlocked the door, opening it slowly. You turned the lights on, which were off the whole time and Namjoon squinted his eyes, hissing.\u00a0\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d You told him, your arms crossed in front of your chest.<br></p><p>He opened his eyes and stood up carefully, his palm on the wall to help him steady his vulnerable drunken state.\u00a0\u201cYou took your sweet time coming here\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widened as you realized, his hair was no longer black. His smooth black hair has suddenly become a dirty blond colour, which somehow complimented his recently tanned skin tone perfectly.\u00a0\u201cYou- You\u2019re blond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d He grinned widely.\u00a0\u201cWe made a bet with the guys! So I did it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, you are such an idiot\u201d You rolled your eyes and breathed in, taking a whiff of a terrible smell. You squinted your eyes in disgust and pinched your nose with your index finger and your thumb.\u00a0\u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, you took your sweet time. I couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer!\u201d He whined.<br></p><p>\u201cOh my god, did you seriously pee in the bucket?\u201d You asked, surprised.<br></p><p>\u201cWanna see?\u201d He asked.<br></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here. The ones who started this mess in the first place can handle it\u201d<br></p><p>Namjoon giggled and as soon as he walked out, you locked the closet again and pushed Namjoon towards the bathroom across the hall.\u00a0\u201cFirst you clean your hands and then we can leave\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act worse than my mother, Jesus Y/N\u201d He rolled his eyes. He did as you said and proceeded to clean his face with some water. Surprisingly enough, he could walk perfectly even if he is drunk. Maybe, just maybe the alcohol was starting to wear off of him.<br></p><p><i>This is your chance Y/N. Leave him here and act as if you never came the next day. You can\u2019t let him sober up and then have him tease you for the rest of the year. What if you start talking in the car and he gets his logic back and you confess something you don\u2019t want him to know? Maybe you\u2019re being overdramatic. He can\u2019t sober up this fast.</i></p><p>You quickly gave Jungkook his key back and tried to get Namjoon out of the party. He followed you behind and you caught Jimin\u2019s stare, gesturing you to call him if anything goes wrong. So many things <i>could</i> go wrong.</p><p>You got Namjoon safely at the back seat of your black SUV and made your way to the driver\u2019s seat. You made sure to get out of the drive way as quickly as possible, not wanting to give any more attention to yourself. You don\u2019t want anyone talking about your cameo appearance in campus tomorrow. That is actually the last thing you want.</p><p>\u201cDoes it smell like food in here?\u201d He asked. He popped his head up from the back seat and his eyes darted to the recyclable Taco Bell paper bag on the passenger\u2019s seat.\u00a0\u201cYou got me food?! God, Y/N I love you\u201d His lips left a quick kiss on your cheek as he hugged you from behind. He is so lucky you are a good driver, otherwise, you could have ended up hitting a tree from his sudden display of affection.</p><p>You decided to park your car at the Taco Bell parking lot, which wasn\u2019t far from your own apartment. You parked at a secluded corner and took in a deep breath after you shut the engine off.\u00a0\u201cYou can come to the front now\u201d</p><p>Like a child getting what it wants, Namjoon climbed out of the back seat and opened the door to the passenger\u2019s seat. You took the paper bag in your hands and set it in the middle of the both of you, taking your iced tea out. The only thing that could calm you down at this point is tea. Everything else seems too uncertain to give you reassurance.</p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d Namjoon exclaimed as soon as he took the first bite out of his taco.\u00a0\u201cYou even got my favourite\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust eat and shut up,\u201d You said, taking the fries out of the bag. You put your music playlist on, the chill song that came on softly playing in the background of the silence between you and him.<br></p><p>You were surprised at how quickly he devoured all three tacos and downed his coke like it was water. You were just about done with one small fries and sipped on your last few drops of tea.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon sat back and rubbed his stomach with a smile on his face.\u00a0\u201cThanks\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d You said, looking out of the window. As you looked at the first few cars passing by so early in the morning, you felt Namjoon\u2019s hand on your thigh, playing with the edge of your skirt. His favourite skirt.\u00a0\u201cAh, look at you. You really wore it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You avoided his stare at all costs. His stare when sane and sober might be deadly, but his drunken stare is inviting and that is all the more worse. It\u2019s too easy for you to manipulate. You could steal your chance and do anything you wanted right about now. You have thought about it plenty of times, so why not do it now?\u00a0\u201cYeah. I wore it\u201d</p><p>He smiled gently, his dimples popping out of both of his cheeks as his thumb caressed the exposed skin of your thigh. He shuffled in his seat and rested his chin on your shoulder, his breath fanning your neck. A trail of goosebumps rose on your honey skin as his lips made contact with your neck. You took in a sharp shaky breath as his tongue darted out on your skin, taking you by surprise.\u00a0\u201cI need to get you home\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d He said, placing a delicate kiss. He brought your skin between his teeth and you knew this was getting too far, too fast. You wanted to savor his lips on your body as much as you could, but you knew it wasn\u2019t right. Every time he got too close, sober or not, every time he put his hands on you so innocently, you felt as if he was your Pandora\u2019s box and you felt more and more intrigued, your will rising each time he grazes your thigh, your hand, your cheek, your neck, anything.<br></p><p>You knew opening this box, this mind of his and its twisted ways that are so well masked underneath his perfectly sculpted dimples and piercing dark brown eyes would cause an avalanche of problems to fall on your already hurt shoulders, ready to collapse if more burden is put on them. It\u2019s not like your life is perfect. Your life is far from perfect. People like Namjoon just make it a little less shitty and you don\u2019t want to risk losing that.</p><p>You gently pushed Namjoon away and put your hands on the steering wheel, your knuckles turning white from the pressure you put.\u00a0\u201cEnough\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d He pouted.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to sleep\u201d You smiled gently, trying not to show too much of your anger. You turned the engine on and started driving, the familiar road towards the apartment he shares with Jin and Hoseok.</p><p>You caught him furrowing his eyebrows from the corner of your eyes, his pretty pink lips opening to speak and you waited for him to utter the first stupid thing that came into his mind, only for his actually logical question to surprise you.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you going this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to your apartment. Does alcohol make you an amnesiac as well? That\u2019s new\u201d You kept your eyes focused on the road as the first few cars of people going to work have started making their way into the road.<br></p><p>\u201cI thought I was coming with you. It would be better not to show up like this in the apartment, right?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cI think Hoseok\u2019s girlfriend will be over too\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, so I have to baby you for the rest of the day?\u201d You raised your eyebrow at him. He parted his lips to speak, not knowing how to respond and you shook your head.\u00a0\u201cThis is a one-time thing\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve slept in your apartment before,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cI mean you, drunk, in my apartment. It\u2019s not happening again\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cIt made everyone see how my girlfriend cares about me though\u201d He smiled and giggled, pressing a light kiss on your shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cHa, funny Namjoon. Funny\u201d You let out a cold laugh as you turned and pulled into your neighborhood. Your regular parking spot waited for your car to be placed perfectly in front of the door of your apartment, something that always made your perfectionist side feel the most satisfaction it can possibly feel.<br></p><p>At this point, Namjoon was able to walk towards your apartment at his own accord and strengh, which you were grateful for. A few more minutes and he could sober up. You can see he is in this sleepy state that if you keep him up for too long, he might just puke the alcohol out and be himself again.</p><p>You practically forced him to sleep on the couch as you didn\u2019t want to wake up next to him in the morning and have to face him. He whined for a few minutes until he passed out. You tucked him in and made your way towards the bathroom to change back into your comfortable pajamas. Even if you felt tired, you tossed and turned on the couch, bothered by the whole situation and finding it unbearable to just let it go. You overthought and analyzed every single day. This night was no different, but it was way more intense.</p><p><i>You need to get over him and stop this madness, Y/N. It\u2019s slowly driving you insane,</i> you thought.</p><p>You had really started to think you had gotten over him the past few weeks. All it took to hit you into reality was this night. This sleepless night of procrastination and guilt.</p><p><b>[Sunday, 12:28 pm]</b></p><p>You stepped your foot into the small local coffee shop you and Jimin loved the bell over the door ringing, announcing your presence. You smiled gently as you saw Jimin waiting at the corner booth you always chose to sit at, two cups of cold brew latte, extra ice for you.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been waiting?\u201d You asked him as you sat down, not bothering to take your big jean jacket off. It smelled like Namjoon from yesterday, as he had decided to steal it from you at some point while he was in the back seat where you had also left your jacket.<br></p><p>Jimin pushed the cup towards you with a sweet smile and you took your first sip, gladly letting the coffee run in your veins.\u00a0\u201cNot long, I got here five minutes ago. Don\u2019t worry, all of your precious ice cubes have remained intact\u201d</p><p>You smiled like a child getting a brand new strawberry lollipop, a cute toothy smile as you took another sip. You had this weird obsession with eating ice cubes. To be honest, the most exciting part of drinking anything cold was being left with a few drops that coated the ice cubes, to give you a sweet crispy sense in your mouth.\u00a0\u201cThanks\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s lover boy doing?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>\u201cNo idea\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s probably still passed out. It was 7 am when we got back\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDamn, what took you so long? Car sex? I know Namjoon gets even more dominant when he\u2019s drunk, so how are your legs still in place?\u201d He teased you.<br></p><p>You rolled your eyes at him and curled your lips around your straw.\u00a0\u201cYour humor is especially awful today, Park Jimin. I got him food, we ate it in the parking lot and we left. What took so long was me contemplating to walk into the party in the first place\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yeah\u201d He laughed.\u00a0\u201cYou looked like a lost puppy. That\u2019s how he makes you look when you think of him\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot a good look on me, I hate not knowing shit,\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you seriously asking me? You know what, if you are asking it is actually serious\u201d He said, furrowing his eyebrows.<br></p><p>You looked around cautiously, hoping no one that knew you were looking and moved your thick choker to allow him to see the purple hickey on your neck. You weren\u2019t expecting Namjoon\u2019s playful little drunk bites to leave a hickey this dark, yet here you were wearing a choker after months.\u00a0\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Jimin said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I was wondering why you wore a choker. I thought you dropped them long ago, as they- and I quote-\u00a0\u2018aren\u2019t in fashion anymore\u2019. Can you enlighten me? Did you really eat food? Because it seems to me as if Namjoon went right to dessert\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get laid last night? Because you seem awfully cheery today\u201d You shot back.<br></p><p>\u201cYes indeed!\u201d He smirked.\u00a0\u201cBut this is not about me here. This is about your little sexscapade with Namdaddy\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWould you stop!\u201d You laughed, sending him a death glare.\u00a0\u201cHe just\u2026 After we ate, we just sat there, my music was playing and he started being\u2026 touchy\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSounds like a regular day to me,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cHe always does that, Y/N\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe held my upper thigh, he kissed my neck and he gave me a hickey, Jimin. A freaking <i>hickey</i>\u201d You whispered but yelled at him at the same time.\u00a0\u201cI know we\u2019re always touchy but\u2026 When he called me to tell me he was locked in that closet, I told him I was getting ready and he went on to talk about me and how good my ass would look naked and how he wants to hear my singing again because it is good to him\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDamn, he went soft on you? And he still doensn\u2019t let himself see how much he likes you?\u201d He asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, Jimin. If I confront him about this, he will deny all of it. He might act all mighty and dominant but he\u2019s a coward and I don\u2019t want to risk our friendship. It\u2019s as if I had feelings for your crush and I told you\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t have him be all touchy-feely with me anymore. It adds fuel to the fire and I definitely cannot pretend to be his girlfriend any longer. He told me he kissed a random girl for beer pong and I got jealous\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d He asked, raising both of his eyebrows. He locked his jaw in place and you knew for a fact, he was about to say something big.\u00a0\u201cDid he leave out the detail that this random girl was actually Sunmin? Did he also forget to tell you that I found him in Jungkook\u2019s room, zipping his pants with Sunmin rushing out?\u201d<br></p><p>Your lips parted and your jaw dropped in surprise.\u00a0\u201cHe was lucky it was nobody else. He really risked his own stupid plan. He has Sunmin being the biggest slut out there and he\u2019s bulding himself a fuckboy title. You two really need to talk, Y/N. I don\u2019t care what exactly you will tell him, but this pact is not good for any of you\u201d</p><p>You nodded and bit your lip, breaking an ice cube with your teeth to calm you down.\u00a0\u201cHe cheated on his imaginary girlfriend and then asked for her to pick up his mess. How romantic\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was plastered and he doesn\u2019t accept his feelings. Let\u2019s be honest, the way he is handling everything, he\u2019s not going to be acting sane unless you slap some sense into him\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cTurn the tables, Y/N. Be the smart one and the one who will sooth your problems. Namjoon might be good with feelings about loving yourself, but he is definitely not good with feelings towards other people\u201d<br></p><p>You nodded again, taking the last sip of your coffee.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do with him anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe slept at my place. He slept on the bed, I slept on the couch. Well, I didn\u2019t sleep, I could only get a 30-minute nap. I woke up, got showered, dressed, wrote him a note asking him to be out of my apartment by 1 pm and drove here\u201d You said, biting down on your lip, a habit you always found solace in when you felt guilty or giddy.\u00a0\u201cI let him use the shower though\u201d<br></p><p>Jimin laughed and smiled at you, shaking his head at your cute way of trying to stay mad at Namjoon.</p><p><b>[Thursday, 17:04 pm]</b></p><p>You made your way out of your college campus, finally done with your classes for today and plugged in one of your earphones to listen to your regular music, a coping mechanism for you. Whenever your feelings get all distorted or too intense, you have found music to work the best in calming you down. Nevertheless, the song that came on shuffle in your chill playlist didn\u2019t exactly help with keeping your mind quiet.</p><p><i>Why did Ariana Grande have to make such relatable songs?!</i>, you thought.</p><p>You walked out, your feet carrying you towards the parking lot until more students started to come out and a familiar face caught your attention. You locked eyes and you cursed under your breath. This has been a confrontation you have been avoiding for as many days as you could, even if you promised Jimin you would be done with it very soon.\u00a0</p><p>Your pace quickened as you saw Namjoon walk towards you. Why did he have to wear that flowy blue and white shirt? All you want to do is take it off of him. He even paired it with a grey beanie. The things he does to you with solely his sense of fashion are incredible.</p><p><i>Focus, Y/N.</i></p><p>He picked up your pace and started walking beside you. You raised your hand with your other earphone in hand, but he caught your wrist so that you can\u2019t plug it in. He wrapped his arm around your shoulders with a smile on his face and placed a peck on your cheek.\u00a0\u201cWhere has my lovely girlfriend been the whole week while everyone was thinking how good we looked together at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing important things, now could you let me breathe? I\u2019d appreciate it\u201d You said. <i>Of course, he wants you only for this publicity stunt.</i><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been ignoring me ever since the party. What\u2019s wrong with you lately? You kick me out of your apartment with a note and then give no shits about me?\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cI thought we were on the same page here\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe are. I picked you up from the party. Isn\u2019t that enough Namjoon?\u201d You asked. He stepped in front of you and put his hands on your shoulders, stopping you from walking any further.\u00a0\u201cI need to be at work by 6\u2033<br></p><p>\u201cCall in sick,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I make a living out of that intership, I can\u2019t lie\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it,\u201d He said, snatching your phone from your hands. He unplugged your earphones, making the music stop and you saw him search for the call app.<br></p><p>\u201cHey, give it back!\u201d You protested, trying to take it away from him. Namjoon blocked your small frame by placing his arm in front of your chest and dialed the number of your work with his free hand. He put the phone next to his ear and placed his index finger in front of your plump lips to silence you.<br></p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of Y/N L/N, I\u2019m her boyfriend. Nice to meet you too. Yeah, she can\u2019t be present today as she is sick. Yeah she has the flu, you know, from all the iced drinks she has every day\u201d He laughed lightly and your eyes threw darts towards him. \u201cCareless Y/N. She\u2019s extremely sorry. Oh yes, thank you! I will tell her that. Thank you very much, have a nice day\u201d He smiled and ended the phone call. Without a warning, he shot you a cold smile as he put your phone in the back pocket of his jeans.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not getting it back until I say so. Your tricks of putting music on as a way to stop listening to me are over\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis is a violation of my privacy!\u201d You protested. He rolled his eyes from your loud demeanor and pulled you towards a hall, where nobody could hear you.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?! I don\u2019t need to talk right now Namjoon\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t whine. I scored you a sick leave from today until Sunday, be grateful\u201d He said.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a sick leave, I\u2019m not sick! You make me sick, not a disease. But you know what? You\u2019re just like a disease. You stick on people and only leave if you kill it. And that is my last solution so guess who\u2019s going to end up dead by the end of this sick leave\u201d You smiled coldly.<br></p><p>\u201cStop being a child,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cYou came to the party\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you peed in a bucket, what\u2019s your point?\u201d You asked, shrugging.<br></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows and squinted his eyes in complete confusion.\u00a0\u201cI did?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cY/N, this is not the point! You came to the party when you said you wouldn\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me and you were drunk. Unfortunately, I\u2019m the only person that you act sane around when drunk so I couldn\u2019t leave you to the others to handle. I needed to come\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened? It didn\u2019t really look good for you to show up, drag me out and then make no contact with me until today\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cAnd that song you posted on your Instagram story a couple of days ago? Better off without him? What the fuck Y/N? Everyone thinks we broke up\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo what? This doesn\u2019t look good, that doesn\u2019t look good, nothing looks good lately. Well seems like I\u2019m not good enough for the fake girlfriend part\u201d You shrugged, ignorant of his ego.\u00a0\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll fabricate a good break up story for you. Like, Namjoon breaks up with current girlfriend because he cheated on her with his ex or something like that\u201d You shot.<br></p><p>He was left dumbfounded, his lips parted as he gulped down nervously.\u00a0\u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m fabricating stories. Although I\u2019m surprised with how well everyone is hiding from me the fact that you kissed some random girl during beer pong. Maybe it was because they were plastered and have probably forgotten about my existance. They always do\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kiss anyone\u201d He lied.<br></p><p>\u201cYou called me and told me yourself, Namjoon. But I mean it\u2019s fine as long as your image is not destroyed, right?\u201d You smiled, a fake smile. You felt so done with his shit and all of his plans to keep his image clean in order to get what he wants. You could seriously punch him at this point and not be sorry for it at all.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. This is awfully confusing\u201d He shook his head.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s confusing, huh? Have you ever thought how goddamn exhausting it might be for me as well? Pretending when I\u2019m only just finding myself. It\u2019s quite of a let down when the person who helped you find yourself in the first place is the one who made you lose it in mere seconds as well\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cI- Then what the hell are you implying? That we should break up?\u201d He asked.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe might as well do. We might as well do, in all meanings. I need closure Namjoon. I don\u2019t want you in my life anymore if you\u2019re going to let me get lost in my own thoughts and guilt again. You helped me break down my walls and now you\u2019re just giving me the bricks to rebuild it\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cBut you just won\u2019t let me,\u201d You said. Your voice was getting weaker than before and you could feel your eyes water and your cheeks heat. It has been such a long time ever since you last cried and so many emotions have built inside you for the past week, that maybe giving up and accepting to talk to him wasn\u2019t the best idea for your mental stability.</p><p>You crossed your arms in front of your chest and bit your lip, trying not to let yourself slip from your own hands as you looked around for any passersby.\u00a0\u201cI never knew I made you feel this way\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, living behind a mask and building an ego as high as yours can do that, surprisingly\u201d You laughed coldly.\u00a0\u201cLet me breathe, Namjoon\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI- You can\u2019t just leave me. You have been away from me for days, isn\u2019t that enough? For me it seemed like an eternity of trying to get a minute alone with you\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Wanting to get that attention, to feel that sort of affection from someone, but he or she just gives it to anybody but you? Sucks to be you, really\u201d You said. Your anger boiled and you felt a knot tie at the pit of your stomach.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I have been neglecting your needs of being the cover for you to be a fuck up. I don\u2019t think being a fuckboy is really the image you want right now, is it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhatever you are saying makes no sense to me whatsoever\u201d He shook his head, huffing.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re acting as if we really are dating. If you want to change the rules of the pact just let me know. Did you change your mind on the no kissing policy? We can change that you know, I never understood why kissing was forbidden in the first place. Sometimes I feel like you are in love with me or something\u201d He snorted.</p><p>You burst out laughing, not able to hold it in anymore. Doesn\u2019t he understand how badly he has damaged himself? How much his plan has changed him. He can\u2019t even think properly anymore. All he does is lie and deny each and every one of his mistakes.\u00a0\u201cDo you really think lying will get you anywhere? I am doing you a favor here Namjoon. A bloody favor is what leaving you is. You got what you wanted, you got Sunmin back. You never even lost her, you always had her and that is why it was so easy to get her into bed with you. I\u2019m only an obstacle for you now\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try to lie about it anymore. Jimin told me he walked in on you after you were done, in Jungkook\u2019s bedroom\u201d You said.<br></p><p>He closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, streching his hands at the back of his head. He hit his fist on the wall out of frustration.\u00a0\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so frustrated for? You were planning to keep it a secret from me forever?\u201d You asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on letting that happen in the first place. I wasn\u2019t planning on getting shit faced either, you know. But that\u2019s who I am when you\u2019re not there. Having to baby your drunk ass is way more fun you know\u201d He smiled, guilt in his smile.\u00a0\u201cSleeping with Sunmin was\u2026 it was just as if I had sex just to not be frustrated anymore, but look what I did now! I thought that if I slept with her I would get my head back in the game and stop wanting to mess everything up, but it made it worse\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you frustrated for, exactly? Your life is freaking perfect! You have so many amazing friends, you have girls running behind you all the time, Sunmin never stopped wanting to be the slut she is with you\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cNot to brag, but you also got the priviledge of making me feel bad. I\u2019ve kind of heard making Y/N feel like a waste of life is very fun. Sunmin knows that\u201d<br></p><p>He took in a deep breath and nodded to himself.\u00a0\u201cI thought she had changed\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t change just like that, Joon. And they definitely do not regret their actions easily if they have an ego as big as hers\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cYou know, I only agreed to this pact because I thought it would take no time for it to be over with. Just a sweet little torture. Since Sunmin hates my guts, I thought she would get mad and want you back right away. I also only want to see you happy, which is what she made you feel like. I thought she changed myself, I thought she started becoming a better person, but the fact that she slept with you at that party, the party she knew for a fact I wasn\u2019t going, means she hasn\u2019t changed one bit. She keeps hurting me even after two years and now she made you hurt me too\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, let me speak. I have the <i>right </i>to speak\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI never understood why you dated her in the first place. You were the one to pull me out of the hole she threw me in and I thought you were on my side. The angry one. But then you told me you met her, talked to her at a party and you thought she seemed nice. It was a year after she hurt me. Naturally, the stupid girl I am, I believed you. Only because I missed her. It is true that you can be mad at someone and miss them at the same time, Namjoon. You two just seem to get that out of me. She made you happy when you dated and I felt as if\u2026 as if this girl\u2019s purpose was to just take away from me all I love, constantly. She was my best friend. Then she took that away from me and she also took you from me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let her take me,\u201d He said, shaking his head.\u00a0\u201cI- I acted like I was naive\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou were\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cBut she has that power, to seem as if she has changed and then turn into the two-faced person she is. I agreed to the pact because I thought I would finally get my best friend back. Yet she still seemed to be the only thing you talked about. We never talked about me anymore and I had to take care of myself on my own. But I also got so obsessed with playing your girlfriend and making sure you were happy that I forgot what I actually wanted\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s worse than you think it is, Y/N. I- Sunmin just helped me open my eyes but you know that sometimes I get lost too. Sometimes I am selfish and put myself first. I thought that if I got back with her maybe everything would be normal again\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou should have told me, Namjoon. You know for a fact that just because I have depression, just because I used to want to end it all doesn\u2019t mean I am some delicate flower. You can talk to me. You can tell me how you feel\u201d You said.\u00a0\u201cI am even more mad at you for not opening up\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I talked to you, I would have lost you\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI saw how eager you were into helping me get Sunmin back, I got it as a message that that is all you wanted. For me to date someone else. I kind of used you in a way. I did initially want Sunmin back but falling into the routine of acting as if we were together felt good and for a moment I forgot about her. It felt\u2026 refreshing to not be suffocated with the thought of her. Because that\u2019s how it feels when I\u2019m with you. You know that feeling? When sometimes, when things are a certain way, it feels as if everything has fallen into place?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know how it feels\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t think you are healthy for me anymore, Namjoon. Jimin thinks that too. Everyone can see it, besides you\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCan see what?\u201d He asked, clueless over the fact that you are head over heels for your own best friend.<br></p><p>\u201cThat-\u201d You took in a deep breath.\u00a0\u201cJimin told me\u2026 He told me that everyone can see how we feel about one another but us. He said you have that\u00a0\u2018look\u2019 on your face. That look someone has when they are whipped for someone. The look that always makes you smile when we watch KDramas together. When the guy looks at the girl with hearts in his eyes or whatever\u201d<br></p><p>He laughed lightly and nodded, licking his lips.\u00a0\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I know?! I\u2019m just a naive girl that- never mind. Let\u2019s leave it at that\u201d You said.<br></p><p>\u201cI want to change something in our rules for the pact,\u201d He said, clearing his throat. The moment you thought he understood you, he brought up the pact again.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 What?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI want to erase the no kissing rule,\u201d He said.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Your eyes widened.<br></p><p>\u201cI want to know\u2026\u201d He took a step further.\u00a0\u201cI want to confirm how whipped I am\u201d He smiled cheekily. His dimples popped, perfectly carved into both of his cheeks as always. He held your chin with his index finger and as your eyes were locked on his lips, you forgot what he even told you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay stop\u201d You shook your head, seeing as this was getting out of hand.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t be touching me like this anymore!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? Like what? Did you hear what I told you?\u201d He asked.<br></p><p>\u201cLike - like we\u2019re an item! Or you can\u2019t look at me like you want to undress me and eat me for dessert. And when I told you I don\u2019t want you drunk around me anymore, I meant it! You told me you wanted to see me naked and you can\u2019t do that!\u201d You started stomping up and down in front of him, trying to shake away the thought of his lips. His lips on your neck, his hand on your thigh, his eyes sinking into yours and your skin melting under his fingertips.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be getting over you!\u201d</p><p>Namjoon raised his brows and laughed.\u00a0\u201cDid you just think out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I- No!\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m playing the fake girlfriend\u201d You lied.\u00a0\u201cAs the fake girlfriend, I think you are a bad kisser so I don\u2019t want to kiss you\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know, Jimin is right. We\u2019re goddamn blind and in your case, you are deaf too\u201d He said. Namjoon took your hands and stopped you in front of him for what seemed like the tenth time today.<br></p><p>\u201cExcuse you! My senses are great!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYet when I told you I want to see how whipped I am for you, you hear nothing\u201d He giggled.<br></p><p>Your lips parted and you looked at him dumbfounded.\u00a0\u201cUh\u2026 what? Pft! Of course, I heard that. God, you\u2019re such a good actor\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod Y/N, stop it\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cAnswer this question for me. Why in the world, when you have all you want in front of you, you just let it go? You always put others first. Be a little selfish and <i>kiss me</i>\u201d<br></p><p>For a moment you thought you were hallucinating for real. You thought you were dreaming or reading one of your own awful works. But it was him, right in front of you, asking you to break the number one rule you had set months ago. You\u2019ve never wanted to be a rebel more in your life and you took your chance. You grabbed the collar of his shirt and crashed his lips against yours. You stood on your tip toes, the height difference between the two of you immense. A smile formed on Namjoon\u2019s lips but it didn\u2019t break the kiss, it even made it better.</p><p>He grabbed your waist and lifted you up. You wrapped your legs around his waist and he secured you by pushing you against the maroon brick wall. It is one thing to imagine how kissing him would feel like and another how it actually felt in reality. No, kissing him didn\u2019t seem like a dream. It felt like it completed all that has been happening for years now. Like it justified how you acted with one another.</p><p>You smiled throughout the kiss and were eventually the one to break it, as you giggled from the fact that Namjoon had to lift you up so you could kiss.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I couldn\u2019t help it. Jesus Christ, I can\u2019t even reach your face Joon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tiny and I love it\u201d He smirked.<br></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d You pouted.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t act as if this saved everything. You have a lot to make up for\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMhm. I know\u201d He said.\u00a0\u201cBut I have four days of you to myself to fix it since you don\u2019t have to go to work\u201d His lips pulled into a cheeky grin and you playfully smacked his arm.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d You said. He looked down at you, caressing your cheek with his thumb. He placed a strand of hair behind your ear and his eyes traveled towards your neck.</p><p>\u201cHa. Seems like the hickey I gave you wasn\u2019t that bad anyway. I should make up for that\u201d He said.<br></p><p>Your eyes widened at his words. How did he know that he gave you a hickey?\u00a0\u201cDid- How do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that all I did after we ate, was of my own accord\u201d<br></p><hr><p><b><a href=\"https://evasthoughtplace.tumblr.com/post/174789672548/masterlist-bts\">Masterlist</a></b></p><p><i>Dedicated to my babes: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4-K_poMzR3fbfh0_Tf6ig\">@gukkmeup</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9lbRVplFQzzK-YVZ_tTerQ\">@introjinnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLP_jnUZaduXd_j_Ln32ZQ\">@hobi-stole-my-heart</a></i></p></p>",

Some things are based on my own life, my own feelings, and relationships. I hope I delivered with this story!</i></p><hr /><p><b>[Saturday, 04:53 am]</b></p><p>Your fingers trailed over the black keyboard of your laptop as you typed in meaningless words, saving each and every one on your Word. Your eyes flew to the clock at the bottom of your laptop screen and it read 04:53 am. You sighed at the time and how fast it had passed by, but continued regardless. This was your Saturday night, most of them were like this. Even most of your normal days ended up like this. You sitting on your bed with your laptop on your legs, only the light from the screen illuminating your face, your headphones plugged in to keep any sound away.</p><p>A strand of hair fell in the middle of your face and you blew it off only for it to fall back down. You placed it behind your ear and continued your work, only for another distraction to pop up. Your phone buzzed beside you, the screen opening. Your eyes darted to it and as soon as you saw Namjoon&rsquo;s image displayed, you picked it up, eyebrows scrunched together in confusion.</p><p>You just stared at the screen for a mere second, contemplating on whether you should pick up or not. You were already boiling at him having the nerve to call so late at night. Wasn&rsquo;t he supposed to be at a party right now? You were more than sure he had invited you as well, on Wednesday, and you had turned him down because you were mad at him. It was Jungkook&rsquo;s party but he would understand. Now Namjoon, on the other hand, was just as pissed as you were, as his own best friend turned him down.</p><p>You rolled your eyes and sighed, swiping right.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Babe, finally! What took you so long?&rdquo; He asked. His voice sounded huskier than usual.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; You asked, coldly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why so harsh? I&rsquo;m hurt&rdquo; He said and laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m drunk&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for telling me? If this is a stupid drunk call, then you&rsquo;re wasting my time&rdquo; You told him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The boys were asking for you. I&rsquo;m at the party you were supposed to come, remember?&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;But of course, you had better things to do than to hang out with your best friend&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By hanging out, you mean trying to play matchmaker so that you can get back with Sunmin? No thanks, Joon. I&rsquo;ll pass this time and all the other times you want me to get her to be jealous for you&rdquo;&nbsp; You went off. You knew this wasn&rsquo;t the right time to talk to him about your thoughts, yet you also knew that you weren&rsquo;t going to find any courage to do this while he was sober.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wanted <i>you</i> here, I invited <i>you</i>, not her. If I wanted to invite her, I would have done it&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Jungkook and Taehyung locked me in a closet&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They- What? Why?&rdquo; You asked, laughing.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh! I can barely see!&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have no idea&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, well. Bye&rdquo; You said, ready to hang up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; He yelled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Come get me. I&rsquo;m drunk, remember?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a child. Jin will drive you home&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you! Y/N, my baby girl. Just come to daddy, dammit!&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>You chuckled and shut off your laptop.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are shit drunk, Joon. I&rsquo;m only coming because you&rsquo;re stupid when you&rsquo;re drunk and it doesn&rsquo;t happen often&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I are not stupid!&rdquo; He complained.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, apparently you forget your grammar too,&rdquo; You said, putting him on speaker so that you can throw some clothes on. You can&rsquo;t show up at a party with literally your underwear and a robe around you. You couldn&rsquo;t give less shit about how you looked, but you didn&rsquo;t want to go practically naked. <i>Although most of the whores there are naked at this point.</i><br /></p><p>You heard a loud thud from the other line, more than sure Namjoon has hit his head somewhere. Somehow, he is even more clumsy when he is drunk. If you don&rsquo;t show up in the next twenty minutes, he could even set the closet on fire without knowing how he did it.&nbsp;&ldquo;I hit my head&rdquo; He announced as if you hadn&rsquo;t just heard.&nbsp;&ldquo;Talk to me!&rdquo; He whined.&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up and stay still. I&rsquo;m getting dressed to come there&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; He said, his tone lower.&nbsp;&ldquo;You could always come naked, you know? It&rsquo;s always a sight to see you in your underwear, it will be even better with no clothes. I bet. Wear that dark blue skirt you have, you know, the one that always makes your ass pop even more and has everyone wondering how better it might be exposed&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You almost choked at your own spit at his sudden reveal. You didn&rsquo;t know people had that opinion for you and what was more surprising was Namjoon&rsquo;s opinion about you. <i>He&rsquo;s drunk and talking nonsense</i>, you thought.&nbsp;&ldquo;You really are a piece of work. And I thought you would be more responsible alone at a party. Usually, I am the one who gets drunk and you are the one who drags me home, you know&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See what happens when you leave me alone?&rdquo; He sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m useless&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I told you not to get drunk,&rdquo; You said, putting your combat boots on. You laced them up and fixed your hair in the mirror, letting your natural soft curls fall down your shoulders- but reaching just there and not longer. You loved having your hair short. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly a bob and it wasn&rsquo;t considered long either. The length was just perfect. When you shot the idea that you wanted to cut your hair to your friends, they kept telling you how you should leave your hair get even longer because it suits you. Long dark hair, for a petite curvy figure in her 20s. Fits just right for their stereotypes.<br /></p><p>But not for you. You&rsquo;ve wanted this for so long. You still felt so great about your decision and everyone complimented you despite knowing that they don&rsquo;t like it as much. It made you feel more like yourself, it gave you a sense of confidence no one could understand but you.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny&rdquo; Namjoon interrupted your train of thoughts. You stopped looking at yourself in the mirror and grabbed your phone from your bed.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how you acted all mad when you declined my invite to come to this party, yet you still cared for me enough to tell me not to get drunk. You&rsquo;re such an idiot, you can&rsquo;t even hide that you cannot stay mad at me entirely&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You stopped in your tracks and looked at your phone with a grudge as if he could see you from the other side. You opened your mouth to protest against his claim, but you knew nothing you said would be true. He&rsquo;s drunk, he won&rsquo;t remember any of what you say tomorrow anyway.&nbsp;&ldquo;Shut up. I like it more when you are sober because you know how to lie and pretend&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; You said and grabbed your keys before stepping out of your apartment to walk to your car. You wrapped your palm around the handle of the driver&rsquo;s door after unlocking it and opened it, stepping inside. You fastened your seatbelt securely and placed your phone on the passenger&rsquo;s seat, Namjoon still on speaker. You pressed a few buttons and played your favourite Spotify playlist to drive at night.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ah. There she is. Y/N and her careful driving while listening to music depending on her mood and the time of day&rdquo; Namjoon said and a small smile formed on your lips at his attention to detail.&nbsp;&ldquo;I never tell you this, but I&rsquo;m kind of jealous of how good of a driver you are. So careful, mind set. Yet careless at the same time as you play your music and sing along at times. Sometimes you even sing when we talk on the phone and you think that I can&rsquo;t listen to you, but I do and damn what I would do to listen to that again and again&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, you know?&rdquo; You said, facepalming yourself as you drove out of your neighborhood.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I do&rdquo; He laughed drunkenly.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful though. At the other hand, my driving is awful&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I second that&rdquo; You laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;What I like is that drunk, you are as eager to talk as when you are while sober&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Girl, I could talk for ages,&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;With you especially&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; You said as you turned to a corner. You sighed as you spotted the Taco Bell drive through and drove towards the line. Who are you kidding, there is no line at this time. It&rsquo;s after 5 am.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; You told Namjoon as you pulled at the drive through and placed your finger over the speaker so that he doesn&rsquo;t hear you order.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hello, what would you like to order?&rdquo; The man asked from the speaker.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hi, can I get three chicken soft tacos, one small fries, one diet coke, and an unsweetened ice tea? Thanks&rdquo; You ordered and drove a little further. You kept your finger on your speaker until it was time to collect your order and hoped that Namjoon wouldn&rsquo;t listen. You paid and thanked the cashier quietly, getting no weird looks, surprisingly.<br /></p><p>People are too used to drunk teenagers eating at this time. You placed the bag on the passenger&rsquo;s seat and left your phone right beside it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Who were you talking to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, are you here yet? I&rsquo;m bored. This party was boring enough without you. Also, I hope nobody saw me wink at Sunmin and then kiss a random girl in beer pong&rdquo; He giggled.<br /></p><p>Your lips formed a straight line as you let the silence fall to collect your thoughts. He kissed a random girl, during a game. You told yourself you were over this stupid crush of yours on your very own guy best friend, yet at the mention of him touching, talking to or kissing another person still made the unsettling feeling in your stomach appear.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost there. Almost&rdquo; You sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Great because I need to pee too,&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;What if I pee in this bucket? It fell on me when I hit my head, might as well use it!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon, no!&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pee in that bucket you asshole&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I need to!&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do not do it. Jungkook will be pissed&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;As if I care what baby Jungkook thinks,&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Joonie&hellip;&rdquo; You sighed, knowing how to get him to stop.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine&rdquo; He groaned and you heard him sit back down on the floor. You parked a few meters away from Jungkook&rsquo;s apartment and took your seatbelt off. You took your phone in your hand and pressed the middle button for it to open.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll be there in a second. Don&rsquo;t do anything stupid and piss me off more okay?&rdquo; You told him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. You behave as well. No touching others, no grinding over anyone&rsquo;s dick and no sucking anyone&rsquo;s di-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Joon! Shut the hell up and let me come take your drunk ass home&rdquo; You said and ended the call from the rage that he built so quickly. You got off your car, locked it and put your phone in the pocket of your big jean jacket. You stood in front of the bustling apartment, surprised at the number of people still there. You took in a deep breath and a few thoughts popped in your head.<br /></p><p>Why are you doing this? You told yourself you were over with his crap. He has been on and off with you lately and yet acts as if nothing has changed. He has used you as a pawn to get back with his ex-girlfriend, that you got him to date in the first place. He hasn&rsquo;t had time for you lately either, he has always been hanging out with the boys. You were totally fine with them, you were friends with them as well but he has been making up excuses and canceling plans too many times in the duration of the past three months. And it wasn&rsquo;t only that, he was still touchy feely with you. Even after he broke up, he likes to play with how you react.</p><p>He has let himself turn into who he never wanted to be and you didn&rsquo;t know the reason why. He wouldn&rsquo;t tell you and you couldn&rsquo;t find the courage to talk to him about it either. You were always a confrontatial person, but in his case, he made you feel weak. You felt like putty in his hands, easy to manipulate. You always stood your ground, always went off about what you didn&rsquo;t like, yet when he smiled at you the way he did, you just held an unexplanable grudge. You would never tell him what it was about and he would easily take it away and charm his way into being as playful and affectionate as always.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t a bad friend. He was far from that. He was the perfect friend if that existed. He had his flaws, but the good parts always shined. He was even an amazing person that a lot of people looked up to and you could see why. Yet when you get to know one person, you get to know more of the flaws, the cracks, the insecurities. All of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yo, Y/N! Jesus christ, how hard are you zoning out?&rdquo; Jimin laughed at your face as he waved his hand in front of your eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jimin&rdquo; You let out a breath you didn&rsquo;t know you were holding. You smiled at the sane sight of your good friend and ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s serious if you are zoning out this hard,&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Last time you zoned out like this was when we broke up. Then you broke down, kissed me and smiled like a psycho&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You rolled your eyes at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Two years ago. It was a whole two years ago, Jimin&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here? I thought you were too mad at Joon to come&rdquo; He nudged your shoulder teasingly.<br /></p><p>If one person knew you entirely like an open book, it was Jimin. It was admirable how you two never kept secrets. Even with Namjoon, you two weren&rsquo;t completely transparent. That is how Jimin and Y/N have always been. Raw, honest, stripped down. That&rsquo;s why your relationship ended so smoothly. You worked better as good friends and you both knew it, so you made the mutual decision. As if it was possible, you became even more close from that day.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah well&hellip; He called&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just like that&rdquo; He nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Have you really become this soft for him?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I guess&rdquo; You shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;I even brought him food because he said he was hungry,&rdquo; You said, shaking your head as you looked down at your boots.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s locked in the closet next to Jungkook&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; He told you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very aware&rdquo; You nodded and laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why did they do it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know how the two babies love to fuck with Joon when he&rsquo;s drunk. He&rsquo;s vulnerable. They literally told him that you were in that closet, so he got in and they locked him&rdquo; He explained.&nbsp;&ldquo;He really wanted you here&rdquo; He looked at you, lowering his head so that he can grab your attention and make you stop looking at the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; You shook your head and looked up, swallowing.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just know that Jin might never get him home if he&rsquo;s drunk too. He&rsquo;ll be mad at himself if he doesn&rsquo;t wake up in his bed tomorrow&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care, yet you go out of your way to come all the way across town, almost at dawn to get him home safely,&rdquo; He said, propping his eyebrow.&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t care hun&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jiminie I-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t lie to me&rdquo; He stated.&nbsp;&ldquo;You need to tell him how you feel. I know you think it will be stupid and that he will hate you after it, but he&rsquo;s changed a lot ever since you made that pact to pretend to be his girlfriend so that he can get Sunmin back&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even get how people believe it,&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even kiss!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need to see you kiss to believe it, Y/N. Everyone thought you two were dating from day one, you know that. You know why? Because of that stupid way Joon always looks at you. And I know what you&rsquo;re going to say.&nbsp;&lsquo;Jimin, those stares only exist in movies and mean absolute shit!&rsquo;. Well if they happen only in movies, Namjoon is the perfect candidate to play in&nbsp;one because he does it well&rdquo; He said, trying to change your mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to look weak, Jimin,&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head in confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but when did expressing your feelings make you look weak? It makes you <i>honest</i>. I thought you knew how to do that, I thought you were done with being fake&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing it,&rdquo; You said, crossing your arms in front of your chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;At least not today. Not until I am sure&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You will be sure when you end up with seven cats that you will name after us when you turn 70&Prime; He laughed and ruffled your hair.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Better late than never&rdquo; You shrugged.<br /></p><p>He rolled his eyes at you and giggled, swinging his arm around your shoulders. He placed a kiss on the top of your head and squeezed you tightly against him in reassurance.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you inside. You&rsquo;re never going to make it upstairs without me. If I let you go alone, you might just end up in a jail cell for punching someone to death&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is my hate for drunk teenagers dancing at parties too obvious?&rdquo; You asked as you took your first steps towards the apartment entrance.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re sober it is. When you are drunk, you are the annoyance itself&rsquo; He teased you with a wide smirk.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey! I like to party, but by my own rules&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You always are so bossy. Maybe that&rsquo;s why we didn&rsquo;t work out. You really do need Joon to dick you down and dom your whiny ass&rdquo; He smirked harder.<br /></p><p>You punched his shoulder and laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I really hate you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, baby!&rdquo; He yelled over the music.<br /></p><p>The moment you walked inside and Jimin released you from his embrace to hold your hand and walk in front of you to protect you, a lot of eyes were definitely on you. Or most likely, your bottom half. You really went the route of wearing the skirt Joon told you to wear just to mess him up a little. You received a few quick greetings from Hoseok and Yoongi, Hoseok drunk dancing on top of the coffee table in the living room along with Jin and Jimin helped you pass through the crowd to walk into the kitchen where he knew Jungkook and Taehyung would be, filling up their cups with more alcohol.</p><p>As soon as Jimin released his grip from your hand and you walked in front of your two friends, they stopped drinking, their eyes as wide as an owl&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&ldquo;Which one of you fuckers had the brilliant idea?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook gulped down and stuttered.&nbsp;&ldquo;I- I uh I didn&rsquo;t! It was Taehyung!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; Taehyung exlcaimed and hit Jungkook on his chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was your idea. I don&rsquo;t want my balls cut off by Y/N. I want to have chldren. You&rsquo;re doomed to never find a wife, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such an asshole, I swear to god&rdquo; Jungkook rolled his eyes at Taehyung. As amusing as it was to hear them argue, trying to cover up their little plan, you wanted to get to the point.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How long has it been?&rdquo; You asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;An hour? I think more. He might have died&rdquo; Jungkook said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a dick and it is a proven fact from now on. Brilliant idea, never do it without me again. But do it for a good reason!&rdquo; You protested.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go around and push my relationship with Joon like that. It&rsquo;s uncalled for&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We just wanted to fuck with him, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; Jungkook pouted.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Next time you want to know something about us two, just ask me and don&rsquo;t manipulate Joon. Because I know you did it to prove a point&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Which is that Joon wants your babies,&rdquo; Taehyung said.&nbsp;&ldquo;He called you, mission accomplished. Just date for real, it&rsquo;s tiring&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s not tiring for me either?!&rdquo; You yelled out of frustration.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m not having the best day. He was rambling on the phone and I don&rsquo;t know what to believe anymore. I&rsquo;m going to go get him&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Relax. You&rsquo;re just taking him home&rdquo; Jimin said as you walked out of the kitchen.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know&rdquo; You let out a sigh.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can go now&rdquo; You smiled at him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Text me if anything happens&rdquo; He kissed your cheek one last time and left you be.<br /></p><p>You took in a deep breath and quickly walked up the stairs. Namjoon was the only one that hadn&rsquo;t noticed your feelings at this point. Every one of the boys and your girl friends knew. They were also the only people that knew your relationship was just staged. He was such a smart person, his intelligence and his way of understanding everyone around him was admirable, nevertheless, he couldn&rsquo;t decipher your mind entirely and it drove you insane. You just wished he could see it with his own eyes, make his conclusion and ask you if it is true. The thought of uttering those words to him was simply terrifying.</p><p>Your feet navigated you through the apartment and you knew exactly where that closet was. You remember back a year ago when you were at another party of Jungkook&rsquo;s. You played Seven Minutes In Heaven. Even if you found it childish, the two vodkas and one shot of tequila in your system, told your brain it would be fun. Namjoon and Hoseok had sent you and Jimin inside this closet because they thought it was a bad idea that you two broke up. You remember Hoseok&rsquo;s words exactly.&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;Come on you idiots, you still undress each other with those eyes!&rsquo;</i></p><p><i>Drunk Hoseok never makes sense</i>, you thought. You giggled at the memory of you and Jimin walking inside, being locked in and ending up cracking up. You wanted to make the others think you were actually making out, so you threw a few moans and names here and there. Both of you were sure most of the people playing the game would have their ears on the wood of the door to listen to what was going on. Unfortunately, you blew your plan when Jimin started tickling you and you started laughing hysterically.</p><p>The corners of your lips curled up into a small smile, however, it quickly fell off your pink stained lips and formed a small frown as you prepared yourself to unlock the door to the closet. You had to do this and you had to be cold and quick with it. No having fun, there are limits in your actions. At least there should be, even if you keep them or not.</p><p>You twisted the golden key Jungkook had given you and unlocked the door, opening it slowly. You turned the lights on, which were off the whole time and Namjoon squinted his eyes, hissing.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; You told him, your arms crossed in front of your chest.<br /></p><p>He opened his eyes and stood up carefully, his palm on the wall to help him steady his vulnerable drunken state.&nbsp;&ldquo;You took your sweet time coming here&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes widened as you realized, his hair was no longer black. His smooth black hair has suddenly become a dirty blond colour, which somehow complimented his recently tanned skin tone perfectly.&nbsp;&ldquo;You- You&rsquo;re blond?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; He grinned widely.&nbsp;&ldquo;We made a bet with the guys! So I did it&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swear to God, you are such an idiot&rdquo; You rolled your eyes and breathed in, taking a whiff of a terrible smell. You squinted your eyes in disgust and pinched your nose with your index finger and your thumb.&nbsp;&ldquo;What is that smell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As I said, you took your sweet time. I couldn&rsquo;t hold it back any longer!&rdquo; He whined.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, did you seriously pee in the bucket?&rdquo; You asked, surprised.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wanna see?&rdquo; He asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You shook your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get out of here. The ones who started this mess in the first place can handle it&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Namjoon giggled and as soon as he walked out, you locked the closet again and pushed Namjoon towards the bathroom across the hall.&nbsp;&ldquo;First you clean your hands and then we can leave&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You act worse than my mother, Jesus Y/N&rdquo; He rolled his eyes. He did as you said and proceeded to clean his face with some water. Surprisingly enough, he could walk perfectly even if he is drunk. Maybe, just maybe the alcohol was starting to wear off of him.<br /></p><p><i>This is your chance Y/N. Leave him here and act as if you never came the next day. You can&rsquo;t let him sober up and then have him tease you for the rest of the year. What if you start talking in the car and he gets his logic back and you confess something you don&rsquo;t want him to know? Maybe you&rsquo;re being overdramatic. He can&rsquo;t sober up this fast.</i></p><p>You quickly gave Jungkook his key back and tried to get Namjoon out of the party. He followed you behind and you caught Jimin&rsquo;s stare, gesturing you to call him if anything goes wrong. So many things <i>could</i> go wrong.</p><p>You got Namjoon safely at the back seat of your black SUV and made your way to the driver&rsquo;s seat. You made sure to get out of the drive way as quickly as possible, not wanting to give any more attention to yourself. You don&rsquo;t want anyone talking about your cameo appearance in campus tomorrow. That is actually the last thing you want.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it smell like food in here?&rdquo; He asked. He popped his head up from the back seat and his eyes darted to the recyclable Taco Bell paper bag on the passenger&rsquo;s seat.&nbsp;&ldquo;You got me food?! God, Y/N I love you&rdquo; His lips left a quick kiss on your cheek as he hugged you from behind. He is so lucky you are a good driver, otherwise, you could have ended up hitting a tree from his sudden display of affection.</p><p>You decided to park your car at the Taco Bell parking lot, which wasn&rsquo;t far from your own apartment. You parked at a secluded corner and took in a deep breath after you shut the engine off.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can come to the front now&rdquo;</p><p>Like a child getting what it wants, Namjoon climbed out of the back seat and opened the door to the passenger&rsquo;s seat. You took the paper bag in your hands and set it in the middle of the both of you, taking your iced tea out. The only thing that could calm you down at this point is tea. Everything else seems too uncertain to give you reassurance.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahh&rdquo; Namjoon exclaimed as soon as he took the first bite out of his taco.&nbsp;&ldquo;You even got my favourite&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just eat and shut up,&rdquo; You said, taking the fries out of the bag. You put your music playlist on, the chill song that came on softly playing in the background of the silence between you and him.<br /></p><p>You were surprised at how quickly he devoured all three tacos and downed his coke like it was water. You were just about done with one small fries and sipped on your last few drops of tea.&nbsp;</p><p>Namjoon sat back and rubbed his stomach with a smile on his face.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; You said, looking out of the window. As you looked at the first few cars passing by so early in the morning, you felt Namjoon&rsquo;s hand on your thigh, playing with the edge of your skirt. His favourite skirt.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, look at you. You really wore it?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You avoided his stare at all costs. His stare when sane and sober might be deadly, but his drunken stare is inviting and that is all the more worse. It&rsquo;s too easy for you to manipulate. You could steal your chance and do anything you wanted right about now. You have thought about it plenty of times, so why not do it now?&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah. I wore it&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled gently, his dimples popping out of both of his cheeks as his thumb caressed the exposed skin of your thigh. He shuffled in his seat and rested his chin on your shoulder, his breath fanning your neck. A trail of goosebumps rose on your honey skin as his lips made contact with your neck. You took in a sharp shaky breath as his tongue darted out on your skin, taking you by surprise.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need to get you home&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; He said, placing a delicate kiss. He brought your skin between his teeth and you knew this was getting too far, too fast. You wanted to savor his lips on your body as much as you could, but you knew it wasn&rsquo;t right. Every time he got too close, sober or not, every time he put his hands on you so innocently, you felt as if he was your Pandora&rsquo;s box and you felt more and more intrigued, your will rising each time he grazes your thigh, your hand, your cheek, your neck, anything.<br /></p><p>You knew opening this box, this mind of his and its twisted ways that are so well masked underneath his perfectly sculpted dimples and piercing dark brown eyes would cause an avalanche of problems to fall on your already hurt shoulders, ready to collapse if more burden is put on them. It&rsquo;s not like your life is perfect. Your life is far from perfect. People like Namjoon just make it a little less shitty and you don&rsquo;t want to risk losing that.</p><p>You gently pushed Namjoon away and put your hands on the steering wheel, your knuckles turning white from the pressure you put.&nbsp;&ldquo;Enough&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo; He pouted.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to sleep&rdquo; You smiled gently, trying not to show too much of your anger. You turned the engine on and started driving, the familiar road towards the apartment he shares with Jin and Hoseok.</p><p>You caught him furrowing his eyebrows from the corner of your eyes, his pretty pink lips opening to speak and you waited for him to utter the first stupid thing that came into his mind, only for his actually logical question to surprise you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you going this way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to your apartment. Does alcohol make you an amnesiac as well? That&rsquo;s new&rdquo; You kept your eyes focused on the road as the first few cars of people going to work have started making their way into the road.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I thought I was coming with you. It would be better not to show up like this in the apartment, right?&rdquo; He asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think Hoseok&rsquo;s girlfriend will be over too&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so I have to baby you for the rest of the day?&rdquo; You raised your eyebrow at him. He parted his lips to speak, not knowing how to respond and you shook your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a one-time thing&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve slept in your apartment before,&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean you, drunk, in my apartment. It&rsquo;s not happening again&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It made everyone see how my girlfriend cares about me though&rdquo; He smiled and giggled, pressing a light kiss on your shoulder.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ha, funny Namjoon. Funny&rdquo; You let out a cold laugh as you turned and pulled into your neighborhood. Your regular parking spot waited for your car to be placed perfectly in front of the door of your apartment, something that always made your perfectionist side feel the most satisfaction it can possibly feel.<br /></p><p>At this point, Namjoon was able to walk towards your apartment at his own accord and strengh, which you were grateful for. A few more minutes and he could sober up. You can see he is in this sleepy state that if you keep him up for too long, he might just puke the alcohol out and be himself again.</p><p>You practically forced him to sleep on the couch as you didn&rsquo;t want to wake up next to him in the morning and have to face him. He whined for a few minutes until he passed out. You tucked him in and made your way towards the bathroom to change back into your comfortable pajamas. Even if you felt tired, you tossed and turned on the couch, bothered by the whole situation and finding it unbearable to just let it go. You overthought and analyzed every single day. This night was no different, but it was way more intense.</p><p><i>You need to get over him and stop this madness, Y/N. It&rsquo;s slowly driving you insane,</i> you thought.</p><p>You had really started to think you had gotten over him the past few weeks. All it took to hit you into reality was this night. This sleepless night of procrastination and guilt.</p><p><b>[Sunday, 12:28 pm]</b></p><p>You stepped your foot into the small local coffee shop you and Jimin loved the bell over the door ringing, announcing your presence. You smiled gently as you saw Jimin waiting at the corner booth you always chose to sit at, two cups of cold brew latte, extra ice for you.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been waiting?&rdquo; You asked him as you sat down, not bothering to take your big jean jacket off. It smelled like Namjoon from yesterday, as he had decided to steal it from you at some point while he was in the back seat where you had also left your jacket.<br /></p><p>Jimin pushed the cup towards you with a sweet smile and you took your first sip, gladly letting the coffee run in your veins.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not long, I got here five minutes ago. Don&rsquo;t worry, all of your precious ice cubes have remained intact&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled like a child getting a brand new strawberry lollipop, a cute toothy smile as you took another sip. You had this weird obsession with eating ice cubes. To be honest, the most exciting part of drinking anything cold was being left with a few drops that coated the ice cubes, to give you a sweet crispy sense in your mouth.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s lover boy doing?&rdquo; He asked you.</p><p>&ldquo;No idea&rdquo; You shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably still passed out. It was 7 am when we got back&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Damn, what took you so long? Car sex? I know Namjoon gets even more dominant when he&rsquo;s drunk, so how are your legs still in place?&rdquo; He teased you.<br /></p><p>You rolled your eyes at him and curled your lips around your straw.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your humor is especially awful today, Park Jimin. I got him food, we ate it in the parking lot and we left. What took so long was me contemplating to walk into the party in the first place&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yeah&rdquo; He laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;You looked like a lost puppy. That&rsquo;s how he makes you look when you think of him&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not a good look on me, I hate not knowing shit,&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you keep a secret?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you seriously asking me? You know what, if you are asking it is actually serious&rdquo; He said, furrowing his eyebrows.<br /></p><p>You looked around cautiously, hoping no one that knew you were looking and moved your thick choker to allow him to see the purple hickey on your neck. You weren&rsquo;t expecting Namjoon&rsquo;s playful little drunk bites to leave a hickey this dark, yet here you were wearing a choker after months.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, shit,&rdquo; Jimin said.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I was wondering why you wore a choker. I thought you dropped them long ago, as they- and I quote-&nbsp;&lsquo;aren&rsquo;t in fashion anymore&rsquo;. Can you enlighten me? Did you really eat food? Because it seems to me as if Namjoon went right to dessert&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you get laid last night? Because you seem awfully cheery today&rdquo; You shot back.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes indeed!&rdquo; He smirked.&nbsp;&ldquo;But this is not about me here. This is about your little sexscapade with Namdaddy&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Would you stop!&rdquo; You laughed, sending him a death glare.&nbsp;&ldquo;He just&hellip; After we ate, we just sat there, my music was playing and he started being&hellip; touchy&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like a regular day to me,&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;He always does that, Y/N&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He held my upper thigh, he kissed my neck and he gave me a hickey, Jimin. A freaking <i>hickey</i>&rdquo; You whispered but yelled at him at the same time.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know we&rsquo;re always touchy but&hellip; When he called me to tell me he was locked in that closet, I told him I was getting ready and he went on to talk about me and how good my ass would look naked and how he wants to hear my singing again because it is good to him&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Damn, he went soft on you? And he still doensn&rsquo;t let himself see how much he likes you?&rdquo; He asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, Jimin. If I confront him about this, he will deny all of it. He might act all mighty and dominant but he&rsquo;s a coward and I don&rsquo;t want to risk our friendship. It&rsquo;s as if I had feelings for your crush and I told you&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have him be all touchy-feely with me anymore. It adds fuel to the fire and I definitely cannot pretend to be his girlfriend any longer. He told me he kissed a random girl for beer pong and I got jealous&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He told you that?&rdquo; He asked, raising both of his eyebrows. He locked his jaw in place and you knew for a fact, he was about to say something big.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did he leave out the detail that this random girl was actually Sunmin? Did he also forget to tell you that I found him in Jungkook&rsquo;s room, zipping his pants with Sunmin rushing out?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Your lips parted and your jaw dropped in surprise.&nbsp;&ldquo;He was lucky it was nobody else. He really risked his own stupid plan. He has Sunmin being the biggest slut out there and he&rsquo;s bulding himself a fuckboy title. You two really need to talk, Y/N. I don&rsquo;t care what exactly you will tell him, but this pact is not good for any of you&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and bit your lip, breaking an ice cube with your teeth to calm you down.&nbsp;&ldquo;He cheated on his imaginary girlfriend and then asked for her to pick up his mess. How romantic&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was plastered and he doesn&rsquo;t accept his feelings. Let&rsquo;s be honest, the way he is handling everything, he&rsquo;s not going to be acting sane unless you slap some sense into him&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Turn the tables, Y/N. Be the smart one and the one who will sooth your problems. Namjoon might be good with feelings about loving yourself, but he is definitely not good with feelings towards other people&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You nodded again, taking the last sip of your coffee.&nbsp;&ldquo;What did you do with him anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He slept at my place. He slept on the bed, I slept on the couch. Well, I didn&rsquo;t sleep, I could only get a 30-minute nap. I woke up, got showered, dressed, wrote him a note asking him to be out of my apartment by 1 pm and drove here&rdquo; You said, biting down on your lip, a habit you always found solace in when you felt guilty or giddy.&nbsp;&ldquo;I let him use the shower though&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jimin laughed and smiled at you, shaking his head at your cute way of trying to stay mad at Namjoon.</p><p><b>[Thursday, 17:04 pm]</b></p><p>You made your way out of your college campus, finally done with your classes for today and plugged in one of your earphones to listen to your regular music, a coping mechanism for you. Whenever your feelings get all distorted or too intense, you have found music to work the best in calming you down. Nevertheless, the song that came on shuffle in your chill playlist didn&rsquo;t exactly help with keeping your mind quiet.</p><p><i>Why did Ariana Grande have to make such relatable songs?!</i>, you thought.</p><p>You walked out, your feet carrying you towards the parking lot until more students started to come out and a familiar face caught your attention. You locked eyes and you cursed under your breath. This has been a confrontation you have been avoiding for as many days as you could, even if you promised Jimin you would be done with it very soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Your pace quickened as you saw Namjoon walk towards you. Why did he have to wear that flowy blue and white shirt? All you want to do is take it off of him. He even paired it with a grey beanie. The things he does to you with solely his sense of fashion are incredible.</p><p><i>Focus, Y/N.</i></p><p>He picked up your pace and started walking beside you. You raised your hand with your other earphone in hand, but he caught your wrist so that you can&rsquo;t plug it in. He wrapped his arm around your shoulders with a smile on his face and placed a peck on your cheek.&nbsp;&ldquo;Where has my lovely girlfriend been the whole week while everyone was thinking how good we looked together at the party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doing important things, now could you let me breathe? I&rsquo;d appreciate it&rdquo; You said. <i>Of course, he wants you only for this publicity stunt.</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been ignoring me ever since the party. What&rsquo;s wrong with you lately? You kick me out of your apartment with a note and then give no shits about me?&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought we were on the same page here&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We are. I picked you up from the party. Isn&rsquo;t that enough Namjoon?&rdquo; You asked. He stepped in front of you and put his hands on your shoulders, stopping you from walking any further.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need to be at work by 6&Prime;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Call in sick,&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me? I make a living out of that intership, I can&rsquo;t lie&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; He said, snatching your phone from your hands. He unplugged your earphones, making the music stop and you saw him search for the call app.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, give it back!&rdquo; You protested, trying to take it away from him. Namjoon blocked your small frame by placing his arm in front of your chest and dialed the number of your work with his free hand. He put the phone next to his ear and placed his index finger in front of your plump lips to silence you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m calling on behalf of Y/N L/N, I&rsquo;m her boyfriend. Nice to meet you too. Yeah, she can&rsquo;t be present today as she is sick. Yeah she has the flu, you know, from all the iced drinks she has every day&rdquo; He laughed lightly and your eyes threw darts towards him. &ldquo;Careless Y/N. She&rsquo;s extremely sorry. Oh yes, thank you! I will tell her that. Thank you very much, have a nice day&rdquo; He smiled and ended the phone call. Without a warning, he shot you a cold smile as he put your phone in the back pocket of his jeans.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting it back until I say so. Your tricks of putting music on as a way to stop listening to me are over&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This is a violation of my privacy!&rdquo; You protested. He rolled his eyes from your loud demeanor and pulled you towards a hall, where nobody could hear you.&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing?! I don&rsquo;t need to talk right now Namjoon&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t whine. I scored you a sick leave from today until Sunday, be grateful&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a sick leave, I&rsquo;m not sick! You make me sick, not a disease. But you know what? You&rsquo;re just like a disease. You stick on people and only leave if you kill it. And that is my last solution so guess who&rsquo;s going to end up dead by the end of this sick leave&rdquo; You smiled coldly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stop being a child,&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;You came to the party&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And you peed in a bucket, what&rsquo;s your point?&rdquo; You asked, shrugging.<br /></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows and squinted his eyes in complete confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;I did?&rdquo; He asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N, this is not the point! You came to the party when you said you wouldn&rsquo;t. Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You called me and you were drunk. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m the only person that you act sane around when drunk so I couldn&rsquo;t leave you to the others to handle. I needed to come&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened? It didn&rsquo;t really look good for you to show up, drag me out and then make no contact with me until today&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;And that song you posted on your Instagram story a couple of days ago? Better off without him? What the fuck Y/N? Everyone thinks we broke up&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So what? This doesn&rsquo;t look good, that doesn&rsquo;t look good, nothing looks good lately. Well seems like I&rsquo;m not good enough for the fake girlfriend part&rdquo; You shrugged, ignorant of his ego.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll fabricate a good break up story for you. Like, Namjoon breaks up with current girlfriend because he cheated on her with his ex or something like that&rdquo; You shot.<br /></p><p>He was left dumbfounded, his lips parted as he gulped down nervously.&nbsp;&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m fabricating stories. Although I&rsquo;m surprised with how well everyone is hiding from me the fact that you kissed some random girl during beer pong. Maybe it was because they were plastered and have probably forgotten about my existance. They always do&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kiss anyone&rdquo; He lied.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You called me and told me yourself, Namjoon. But I mean it&rsquo;s fine as long as your image is not destroyed, right?&rdquo; You smiled, a fake smile. You felt so done with his shit and all of his plans to keep his image clean in order to get what he wants. You could seriously punch him at this point and not be sorry for it at all.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. This is awfully confusing&rdquo; He shook his head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s confusing, huh? Have you ever thought how goddamn exhausting it might be for me as well? Pretending when I&rsquo;m only just finding myself. It&rsquo;s quite of a let down when the person who helped you find yourself in the first place is the one who made you lose it in mere seconds as well&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I- Then what the hell are you implying? That we should break up?&rdquo; He asked.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We might as well do. We might as well do, in all meanings. I need closure Namjoon. I don&rsquo;t want you in my life anymore if you&rsquo;re going to let me get lost in my own thoughts and guilt again. You helped me break down my walls and now you&rsquo;re just giving me the bricks to rebuild it&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;But you just won&rsquo;t let me,&rdquo; You said. Your voice was getting weaker than before and you could feel your eyes water and your cheeks heat. It has been such a long time ever since you last cried and so many emotions have built inside you for the past week, that maybe giving up and accepting to talk to him wasn&rsquo;t the best idea for your mental stability.</p><p>You crossed your arms in front of your chest and bit your lip, trying not to let yourself slip from your own hands as you looked around for any passersby.&nbsp;&ldquo;I never knew I made you feel this way&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, living behind a mask and building an ego as high as yours can do that, surprisingly&rdquo; You laughed coldly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me breathe, Namjoon&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I- You can&rsquo;t just leave me. You have been away from me for days, isn&rsquo;t that enough? For me it seemed like an eternity of trying to get a minute alone with you&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It hurts, doesn&rsquo;t it? Wanting to get that attention, to feel that sort of affection from someone, but he or she just gives it to anybody but you? Sucks to be you, really&rdquo; You said. Your anger boiled and you felt a knot tie at the pit of your stomach.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I have been neglecting your needs of being the cover for you to be a fuck up. I don&rsquo;t think being a fuckboy is really the image you want right now, is it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you are saying makes no sense to me whatsoever&rdquo; He shook his head, huffing.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting as if we really are dating. If you want to change the rules of the pact just let me know. Did you change your mind on the no kissing policy? We can change that you know, I never understood why kissing was forbidden in the first place. Sometimes I feel like you are in love with me or something&rdquo; He snorted.</p><p>You burst out laughing, not able to hold it in anymore. Doesn&rsquo;t he understand how badly he has damaged himself? How much his plan has changed him. He can&rsquo;t even think properly anymore. All he does is lie and deny each and every one of his mistakes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you really think lying will get you anywhere? I am doing you a favor here Namjoon. A bloody favor is what leaving you is. You got what you wanted, you got Sunmin back. You never even lost her, you always had her and that is why it was so easy to get her into bed with you. I&rsquo;m only an obstacle for you now&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even try to lie about it anymore. Jimin told me he walked in on you after you were done, in Jungkook&rsquo;s bedroom&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>He closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, streching his hands at the back of his head. He hit his fist on the wall out of frustration.&nbsp;&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you so frustrated for? You were planning to keep it a secret from me forever?&rdquo; You asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t planning on letting that happen in the first place. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on getting shit faced either, you know. But that&rsquo;s who I am when you&rsquo;re not there. Having to baby your drunk ass is way more fun you know&rdquo; He smiled, guilt in his smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sleeping with Sunmin was&hellip; it was just as if I had sex just to not be frustrated anymore, but look what I did now! I thought that if I slept with her I would get my head back in the game and stop wanting to mess everything up, but it made it worse&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you frustrated for, exactly? Your life is freaking perfect! You have so many amazing friends, you have girls running behind you all the time, Sunmin never stopped wanting to be the slut she is with you&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not to brag, but you also got the priviledge of making me feel bad. I&rsquo;ve kind of heard making Y/N feel like a waste of life is very fun. Sunmin knows that&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He took in a deep breath and nodded to himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought she had changed&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t change just like that, Joon. And they definitely do not regret their actions easily if they have an ego as big as hers&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know, I only agreed to this pact because I thought it would take no time for it to be over with. Just a sweet little torture. Since Sunmin hates my guts, I thought she would get mad and want you back right away. I also only want to see you happy, which is what she made you feel like. I thought she changed myself, I thought she started becoming a better person, but the fact that she slept with you at that party, the party she knew for a fact I wasn&rsquo;t going, means she hasn&rsquo;t changed one bit. She keeps hurting me even after two years and now she made you hurt me too&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, let me speak. I have the <i>right </i>to speak&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I never understood why you dated her in the first place. You were the one to pull me out of the hole she threw me in and I thought you were on my side. The angry one. But then you told me you met her, talked to her at a party and you thought she seemed nice. It was a year after she hurt me. Naturally, the stupid girl I am, I believed you. Only because I missed her. It is true that you can be mad at someone and miss them at the same time, Namjoon. You two just seem to get that out of me. She made you happy when you dated and I felt as if&hellip; as if this girl&rsquo;s purpose was to just take away from me all I love, constantly. She was my best friend. Then she took that away from me and she also took you from me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I let her take me,&rdquo; He said, shaking his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I- I acted like I was naive&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You were&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;But she has that power, to seem as if she has changed and then turn into the two-faced person she is. I agreed to the pact because I thought I would finally get my best friend back. Yet she still seemed to be the only thing you talked about. We never talked about me anymore and I had to take care of myself on my own. But I also got so obsessed with playing your girlfriend and making sure you were happy that I forgot what I actually wanted&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than you think it is, Y/N. I- Sunmin just helped me open my eyes but you know that sometimes I get lost too. Sometimes I am selfish and put myself first. I thought that if I got back with her maybe everything would be normal again&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You should have told me, Namjoon. You know for a fact that just because I have depression, just because I used to want to end it all doesn&rsquo;t mean I am some delicate flower. You can talk to me. You can tell me how you feel&rdquo; You said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am even more mad at you for not opening up&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I talked to you, I would have lost you&rdquo; He shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I saw how eager you were into helping me get Sunmin back, I got it as a message that that is all you wanted. For me to date someone else. I kind of used you in a way. I did initially want Sunmin back but falling into the routine of acting as if we were together felt good and for a moment I forgot about her. It felt&hellip; refreshing to not be suffocated with the thought of her. Because that&rsquo;s how it feels when I&rsquo;m with you. You know that feeling? When sometimes, when things are a certain way, it feels as if everything has fallen into place?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know how it feels&rdquo; You nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think you are healthy for me anymore, Namjoon. Jimin thinks that too. Everyone can see it, besides you&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can see what?&rdquo; He asked, clueless over the fact that you are head over heels for your own best friend.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That-&rdquo; You took in a deep breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;Jimin told me&hellip; He told me that everyone can see how we feel about one another but us. He said you have that&nbsp;&lsquo;look&rsquo; on your face. That look someone has when they are whipped for someone. The look that always makes you smile when we watch KDramas together. When the guy looks at the girl with hearts in his eyes or whatever&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He laughed lightly and nodded, licking his lips.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can I know?! I&rsquo;m just a naive girl that- never mind. Let&rsquo;s leave it at that&rdquo; You said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want to change something in our rules for the pact,&rdquo; He said, clearing his throat. The moment you thought he understood you, he brought up the pact again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip; What?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want to erase the no kissing rule,&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Your eyes widened.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want to know&hellip;&rdquo; He took a step further.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to confirm how whipped I am&rdquo; He smiled cheekily. His dimples popped, perfectly carved into both of his cheeks as always. He held your chin with his index finger and as your eyes were locked on his lips, you forgot what he even told you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay stop&rdquo; You shook your head, seeing as this was getting out of hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be touching me like this anymore!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What? Like what? Did you hear what I told you?&rdquo; He asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like - like we&rsquo;re an item! Or you can&rsquo;t look at me like you want to undress me and eat me for dessert. And when I told you I don&rsquo;t want you drunk around me anymore, I meant it! You told me you wanted to see me naked and you can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; You started stomping up and down in front of him, trying to shake away the thought of his lips. His lips on your neck, his hand on your thigh, his eyes sinking into yours and your skin melting under his fingertips.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to be getting over you!&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon raised his brows and laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you just think out loud?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- I- No!&rdquo; You shook your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing the fake girlfriend&rdquo; You lied.&nbsp;&ldquo;As the fake girlfriend, I think you are a bad kisser so I don&rsquo;t want to kiss you&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know, Jimin is right. We&rsquo;re goddamn blind and in your case, you are deaf too&rdquo; He said. Namjoon took your hands and stopped you in front of him for what seemed like the tenth time today.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Excuse you! My senses are great!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yet when I told you I want to see how whipped I am for you, you hear nothing&rdquo; He giggled.<br /></p><p>Your lips parted and you looked at him dumbfounded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh&hellip; what? Pft! Of course, I heard that. God, you&rsquo;re such a good actor&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God Y/N, stop it&rdquo; He shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Answer this question for me. Why in the world, when you have all you want in front of you, you just let it go? You always put others first. Be a little selfish and <i>kiss me</i>&rdquo;<br /></p><p>For a moment you thought you were hallucinating for real. You thought you were dreaming or reading one of your own awful works. But it was him, right in front of you, asking you to break the number one rule you had set months ago. You&rsquo;ve never wanted to be a rebel more in your life and you took your chance. You grabbed the collar of his shirt and crashed his lips against yours. You stood on your tip toes, the height difference between the two of you immense. A smile formed on Namjoon&rsquo;s lips but it didn&rsquo;t break the kiss, it even made it better.</p><p>He grabbed your waist and lifted you up. You wrapped your legs around his waist and he secured you by pushing you against the maroon brick wall. It is one thing to imagine how kissing him would feel like and another how it actually felt in reality. No, kissing him didn&rsquo;t seem like a dream. It felt like it completed all that has been happening for years now. Like it justified how you acted with one another.</p><p>You smiled throughout the kiss and were eventually the one to break it, as you giggled from the fact that Namjoon had to lift you up so you could kiss.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I couldn&rsquo;t help it. Jesus Christ, I can&rsquo;t even reach your face Joon!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tiny and I love it&rdquo; He smirked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; You pouted.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act as if this saved everything. You have a lot to make up for&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. I know&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I have four days of you to myself to fix it since you don&rsquo;t have to go to work&rdquo; His lips pulled into a cheeky grin and you playfully smacked his arm.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unbelievable,&rdquo; You said. He looked down at you, caressing your cheek with his thumb. He placed a strand of hair behind your ear and his eyes traveled towards your neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha. Seems like the hickey I gave you wasn&rsquo;t that bad anyway. I should make up for that&rdquo; He said.<br /></p><p>Your eyes widened at his words. How did he know that he gave you a hickey?&nbsp;&ldquo;Did- How do you remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say that all I did after we ate, was of my own accord&rdquo;<br /></p><hr /><p><b><a href=\"https://evasthoughtplace.tumblr.com/post/174789672548/masterlist-bts\">Masterlist</a></b></p><p><i>Dedicated to my babes: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4-K_poMzR3fbfh0_Tf6ig\">@gukkmeup</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9lbRVplFQzzK-YVZ_tTerQ\">@introjinnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLP_jnUZaduXd_j_Ln32ZQ\">@hobi-stole-my-heart</a></i></p></p>",

You can\u2019t do anything but stand there as worries begin to run through your head, wondering what on earth is going on and if anyone you know - or anyone at all - is hurt. Jin\u2019s name crosses your mind with a pang to your heart, and you fall to your knees,</p><p>\u201cCome on, you have to get up! You can\u2019t stop! We need to get you inside now!\u201d Namjoon tells you, nearly shouting over the turmoil behind you. You shake your head, feeling the tears and the weight of your time here suddenly washing over you. Namjoon lets out what sounds like a growl from deep in his throat and he tears off his suit jacket and throwing it over you, as you\u2019d started shaking form worry and shock at some point. The emotions from what you\u2019ve experienced today finally get to you and Namjoon\u2019s voice fades out into the background. Vaguely you feel strong arms around you; you\u2019re not touching the floor; there\u2019s an erratic heartbeat by your ear and you can hear your own breath alongside it. Time passes around you and you barely register Namjoon taking you straight up through the mansion and to Jin\u2019s office. You find yourself gently placed in Jin\u2019s big chair and you immediately curl yourself up.</p><p>Jin paces in front of you, back and forth across the length of the office. You can hardly focus on him, because all you want to do is cry. Maybe you are crying, you can\u2019t tell. The weight of everything happening is crushing you, and you can feel it on your shoulders as you bring your knees up to your chest, wrapping Namjoon\u2019s jacket tighter around you. You hear Jin\u2019s voice rise slightly, and you jolt as you try to listen,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think, whoever shot here won\u2019t shoot again. We know they\u2019re here, they\u2019ll assume this room is empty,\u201d Jin\u2019s saying to Namjoon, who\u2019s looking at Jin with a steely gaze. You vaguely register the broken window, unable to connect that to the gunshots right now, \u201cI just don\u2019t know how this could have happened. I wasn\u2019t even in here! I\u2019d just left. Why now? That\u2019s the question. If the shots had been just two minutes earlier- wait,\u201d He pauses and you sit up straighter, wondering what he means, \u201cTwo minutes,\u201d He mutters, like it holds some grand meaning for him. Jin goes to take another step, but lets out a sound of pure frustration, suddenly barking for Namjoon to escort you to your room for the night.</p><p>~~~</p><p>30 minutes later, you\u2019re laid on the bed next to Namjoon, wearing a set of the nicer pyjamas that you brought with you. Namjoon\u2019s holding your hand in both of his, gently rubbing his thumb against it as you talk to each other about anything that comes to mind. You stifle a yawn, but Namjoon catches it. He smiles softly and stands up, going to grab two pairs of earphones and a dual jack from his jacket. He places them on the bed before dismissing himself to the bathroom. </p><p>He soon re-enters the bedroom, now dressed in loose grey sweatpants and a tight black t-shirt that shows off his arms well. You smile at him and gesture for him to get into bed. He obliges without question, letting you rest your head on his chest as he fusses around with the earphones, so that you can both have two earphones and still share the same music. If anyone who didn\u2019t know you had walked in, they would\u2019ve thought you and Namjoon were together. But no, you\u2019re just so close that neither of you thinks twice about it,</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just listen to music and sleep. It\u2019s been a long day,\u201d Namjoon murmurs, ruffling your hair before handing you your pair of earphones. You take them with a smile and put them in, feeling sleep creep up on you as Namjoon switches on some calming music and pulls the warm covers over the both of you.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve slept at all when you hear the gunshot. You\u2019ve heard way too many in the past 24 hours for your liking. You\u2019re upright in an instant, and a quick glance at the clock tells you that it\u2019s 5am. Namjoon is right next to you, hands holding your shoulders as he tugs you a little, trying to get you to lay back down. But you won\u2019t. You\u2019re struggling against his grip, terrified that someone you know got shot. It\u2019s sickening that this sense of fear has struck you before. You try to shove Namjoon off, but he\u2019s not having it,</p><p>\u201cLook, just lay down! Jin\u2019s okay, just lay down, please!\u201d He\u2019s begging, but you barely hear over the sound of your own shouts. You\u2019re yelling for anyone you can think of in this house that you care about, wanting to know if they\u2019re okay. Namjoon\u2019s grip tightens on you, finally letting go of his composure as he shoves you down, holding you down by your shoulders as you kick and thrash, screaming for him to get off you. If you\u2019d calmed down for a second, you would\u2019ve seen the disgust written on Namjoon\u2019s face - the disgust at himself for using brute force on you - but you don\u2019t; you just keep screaming and struggling, refusing to stop until you see Jin and Jimin and even Jungkook or V, needing them to be okay.</p><p>You have no clue how much time passes before Jin comes in, eyes wide with worry, and suit jacket ruffled like he\u2019d just put it on. At the sight of your brother, you calm down a little. Namjoon lets go of you and you practically fly across the room, throwing yourself at Jin, so glad that he\u2019s okay,</p><p>\u201cI thought it was you! Jin, I was so scared, I thought it was you, I thought they came back and tried to finish you off,\u201d You tell him, tears slipping out as you repeat over and over that you thought it was him. You push back from him a little, inspecting him for any damage. That\u2019s when you see the drops of blood on his neck, smudged as if they\u2019d been partially wiped off. You push back completely, looking at him like you barely know him. Jin notices your reaction immediately and shakes his head,</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t over react, I\u2019ll explain everything if you just calm down. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019ll be calling an early meeting with my staff, but I\u2019ll leave V with you. Is that okay?\u201d Jin asks, and you\u2019re almost shocked by his soft tone. He\u2019d actually asked you this time. He hasn\u2019t done that in a long time, so you almost feel bad for what you do next. Almost.</p><p>You nod, looking at the floor until you watch Jin move past you to speak to Namjoon. In that moment, you quickly run out of the room, slamming the door behind you. The gunshot came from Jin\u2019s office, and you just know there\u2019s something he\u2019s not telling you. You don\u2019t know why you want to see, but your feet are carrying you up to the office anyway. The security door is carelessly left open, and you don\u2019t bother to ponder that, desperate to reach the office before the two shouting men behind you reach you. You\u2019re almost there, just a few steps away. Jin is yelling at you to not go in, telling you it\u2019s too much for you. You don\u2019t even consider if he\u2019s right before entering. </p><p>But he was right.</p><p>Blood. Blood is everywhere. You\u2019ve never seen so much of it in your life. It\u2019s dripping down the stark white walls, staining them red. There\u2019s lumps in it, slowly sliding down too - it\u2019s a mix of brain and skull, and you find yourself ready to throw up. Your eyes won\u2019t stop looking though, and they eventually find the crumpled body on the floor, the back of their skull gaping, with more brain matter falling out. As if that isn\u2019t enough, your legs move you forward, turning until you can see the face of the body. When you see his wide, dead eyes, the faint scream still on his lips, the dark hair that\u2019s lost all its bounce, that\u2019s now hanging limply across the messy entry wound on his forehead. Jimin\u2019s forehead,</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d You hear from behind you. Jin\u2019s voice is harsh and barely short of a yell as his rough hands grab you and pull you out of the room, not caring that your feet aren\u2019t leaving the floor. You\u2019re thrown into a seat two rooms over, and Jin\u2019s furious face is all you can see as he continues to yell, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever come up here unless you have explicit fucking permission from me or Namjoon! Do you understand?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy would I take orders from a murderer?!\u201d You scream right back, finding your voice in the same instant that your eyes find the smeared blood on your brother\u2019s neck for the second time. Jimin\u2019s blood,</p><p>\u201cYou want to hear about fucking murderers? That man, Park Jimin is a fucking murderer!\u201d Jin yells, his voice doubling in volume as he turns back to slam the door. He tries to continue shouting, but you cut him off, your voice finding a new level of volume that you didn\u2019t realise you had,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk about him like that, he\u2019s more of a brother to me than you ever have been!\u201d You scream, and that shuts Jin up instantly. The anger visibly drains from his body and his mouth closes as he pulls a chair over so that he can sit in front of you, resting his head in his hands. He rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands,</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jin mutters, surprising you. You turn to him and watch him as he takes a deep breath, clearly finding difficulty in continuing, \u201cI know I haven\u2019t done right by you in a long time. But I can\u2019t help it. These people aren\u2019t who they say they are. Jimin was never ours,\u201d Jin tells you, and you frown. Part of you has already supressed the awful image of Jimin\u2019s brains all over the wall just a few metres away so you don\u2019t find it hugely difficult to push it aside in your head and listen to Jin\u2019s words, \u201cHe was always Suga\u2019s man. Working on the inside. I used him for discipline and timing things to perfection, but I never asked where he learned it from,\u201d Jin tells you, and you feel out of your depth,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You ask, trying to keep your voice calm and soothing. Jin sighs and shifts back, reaching in his trouser pocket to get a small envelope out. He holds it in his hands before continuing, slower and more calculated,</p><p>\u201cSuga. Suga\u2019s always been time perfect. I only pieced together the links between Jimin\u2019s obsession with time and Suga\u2019s timely operation after those shots today. And the fact that you smelled his cologne in my office. He\u2019s been sneaking around, under the pretence of being my close friend. Earlier, he brought you to me two minutes early. Had we stayed in that room for two more minutes, you, me, or Namjoon would be dead. His watch is off by two minutes. Do you agree?\u201d Jin asks, watching your face for your reaction. You take a deep breath and nod slowly,</p><p>\u201cBut why? Jimin has always been there for me. How could he do this to me, and to you, and to Namjoon? I thought he was one of my best friends but\u2026\u201d You trail off, unable to string together anymore words. Jin hands you the photos tentatively, and watches your face as you open them. It\u2019s a small set of polaroid photos, showing Jimin and another man around the same height. He has blonde hair, and he\u2019s pale. They\u2019re both dressed in grey sweatpants and blank tank tops, like the young men you saw training on the grounds yesterday. Jimin looks a lot younger, maybe 15 or 16. The man next to him - Suga - looks a little older, but not by much. You turn to Jin and ask what you\u2019re looking at,</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him and Suga training together. I got them anonymously on my birthday last year. I thought nothing of it at the time - that Jimin was too young to know who that man was, that this was just to mess with my head, but now\u2026\u201d Jin starts, but ends up stopping. You look at him, and see the tears in his eyes. It clicks with you that he\u2019d just killed his best friend and here he is, trying to justify it. You reach out to take his hand, your small hands not covering his, but Jin still feels the comfort in the gesture, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t been a good brother at all, but I want you to let me try. I need to brief Namjoon and take care of clean up,\u201d He shivers at the carelessness of his words, but pushes on anyway, \u201cI\u2019ll set aside some time to spend with you as soon as I can. For now, I\u2019ll call for V to stand guard outside your room,\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get him to come inside?\u201d You murmur, averting your eyes as you feel embarrassment creep up your neck and onto your cheeks, \u201cI just lost my brother. I don\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d You say, a whole host of emotions brewing inside of you. At this point, it feels like shock is the only thing keeping you going. Jin nods understandingly and stands up. He pulls out a small flip phone and taps in a few things, hits send and then puts it back in his pocket,</p><p>\u201cV will meet you outside the security door,\u201d Jin sighs, pushing his hair back with his hands, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all of this. I wish you could\u2019ve waited just 6 months to come home, but it\u2019s okay. I think we\u2019re safe now. At least for a little while,\u201d Jin admits, holding his arms out to you. You smile weakly and let him hug you. It feels weird after so long, but it\u2019s oddly comforting. Jin awkwardly pats your shoulder and pulls back, \u201cV should be outside now. I won\u2019t be ages, but I need to talk to Namjoon and make a few calls. Tell V he has permission to enter your room and do whatever it is that he does to calm people down,\u201d Jin tells you before gesturing for you to leave the room. You walk out, passing Namjoon, who\u2019s sat in the hall, eyes a little red from tears. You smile weakly as you head to the security doors, trying not to look into Jin\u2019s office.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Jin beckons Namjoon into the room when he hears the security door buzz shut. He was an idiot to leave it open in the first place. How inconsiderate was it of him to leave it open when Jimin was dead just a few metres away? He had let his emotions get the better of him, and cloud his judgement. But the moment he realised\u2026 he just completely lost control. He\u2019d killed people before but never like this. Never in cold blood. Never the second most trustworthy person in his life. </p><p>But the fact that he was now closer to his vengeance lit something within him that he knows he won\u2019t be able to stop. He\u2019s had his doubts before, wondering if he\u2019d really be able to go through with it when it came down to it, but this really was the ultimate test for him. He\u2019d thought he could trust Jimin nearly as much as he trusts Namjoon, but he was wrong. He\u2019d had his doubts about Namjoon for a few seconds, but that was impossible. He\u2019d grown up with him. And Namjoon\u2019s a terrible liar anyway.</p><p>Namjoon sits on the couch across from Jin, his hair no longer neat. His eyes are red and his breathing isn\u2019t even in any way, but it\u2019s okay. Jin understands why. He sighs and sits back on the couch, trying to come up with a sentence. But he doesn\u2019t have to. Somehow, Namjoon comes up with something first,</p><p>\u201cWhy Jimin?\u201d He asks. His voice is rough, and Jin can instantly tell that he\u2019s angry. He can\u2019t find it in himself to blame the younger man, \u201cHe never did a thing against you and you killed him in cold blood. I trusted you. I did everything you asked of me, and you repay me by killing my best friend. Why Jimin?\u201d Namjoon says again, unable to come to terms with it as easy as Jin has,</p><p>\u201cBecause he was working with Suga. That\u2019s why Hoseok just agreed to meet with us so easily. Suga knew there were no risks, because Jimin would be here. He ordered Jimin to shoot my office. He wanted us dead,\u201d Jin says, slowly and calmly. He watches Namjoon\u2019s face trying to gauge his reaction,</p><p>\u201cIs this to do with your parents?\u201d Namjoon replies simply after about 3 minutes of silence. Jin\u2019s eyebrows raise in response, and leaves a short pause to think of how to phrase his reply. He doesn\u2019t want to tell Namjoon outright what his intentions are, but he doesn\u2019t have much of a choice,</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that revolver you have stashed unceremoniously in the back of your trousers?\u201d Namjoon asks again, and Jin has to actively try not to show his shock. He didn\u2019t realise it was so obvious. It probably wasn\u2019t, to be fair. Namjoon\u2019s just good at what he does. For a long time he\u2019s been in this business, so it\u2019s not really all that surprising that he can tell who\u2019s got a gun on them and who hasn\u2019t. That\u2019s why Jin doesn\u2019t even try and deny it. He just nods, before going into the pocket of his jacket and pulling out the brass shell of a bullet. It\u2019s a little dull, but otherwise unblemished. Namjoon\u2019s eyes widen in shock, but he doesn\u2019t otherwise react,</p><p>\u201cI have 6 of these. One for each person involved with the death of my parents. I want this engraved with Jimin\u2019s name, polished, and put in my glass display case. I\u2019d ask you to do this, but I guess it\u2019s too much. He was your friend and I respect tha- \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Namjoon blurts, cutting Jin off, \u201cI\u2019ll do it if you tell me why his name is going on here. I\u2019ll do all of them, but I need to know why,\u201d Namjoon finishes, his tone strong. He always was good at ignoring his emotions. Jin sighs and places the shell in Namjoon\u2019s open palm. He hadn\u2019t wanted to lay all of his cards out so soon, but if he couldn\u2019t be honest with Namjoon, how could he be honest with himself?</p><p>\u201cHe was meant to be our guy. Jimin was supposed to be on our side, training to help me when I took over. I was going to call him to help me get through things on the night that I found my parents, but he was already there. I assumed he was in for some late night training, that he\u2019d hidden when things started, and hadn\u2019t come out until he realised it was okay but looking back\u2026 he wasn\u2019t even that shaken up. Like he\u2019d expected it. I thought it was good composure, but piecing together what I did today says otherwise. He must have just stood there, or maybe even let their killer in. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I\u2019m mostly certain. When I get to them, I\u2019ll be sure to ask,\u201d Jin promises, and he watches Namjoon nod. It\u2019s enough for him,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check on V, make sure everything\u2019s okay,\u201d Namjoon says, standing up as he slips the case into his pocket, \u201cI\u2019ll get this engraving done. I\u2019m assuming this stays within this room?\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice is emotionless and business like, but Jin knows that it\u2019s so he can pretend it doesn\u2019t matter to him,</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you. If possible, swap V out when she\u2019s asleep. She seems to prefer him, but I trust Jungkook more to watch over her during the night,\u201d Jin instructs Namjoon, standing up to face him,</p><p>\u201cThe new trainee. Jeon?\u201d Namjoon asks, clearly confused. It\u2019s not often that Jin chose to trust new recruits with important tasks,</p><p>\u201cHe argued with V over her safety before dinner. That\u2019s important to me,\u201d Jin states, his tone final. No arguments. Namjoon just nods, turning on his heel and walking out of the door, leaving Jin alone in the room with nothing but his thoughts, and his friend\u2019s dead body just 2 doors down,</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d He whispers into the silence.</p>",

You can\u2019t do anything but stand there as worries begin to run through your head, wondering what on earth is going on and if anyone you know - or anyone at all - is hurt. Jin\u2019s name crosses your mind with a pang to your heart, and you fall to your knees,</p><p>\u201cCome on, you have to get up! You can\u2019t stop! We need to get you inside now!\u201d Namjoon tells you, nearly shouting over the turmoil behind you. You shake your head, feeling the tears and the weight of your time here suddenly washing over you. Namjoon lets out what sounds like a growl from deep in his throat and he tears off his suit jacket and throwing it over you, as you\u2019d started shaking form worry and shock at some point. The emotions from what you\u2019ve experienced today finally get to you and Namjoon\u2019s voice fades out into the background. Vaguely you feel strong arms around you; you\u2019re not touching the floor; there\u2019s an erratic heartbeat by your ear and you can hear your own breath alongside it. Time passes around you and you barely register Namjoon taking you straight up through the mansion and to Jin\u2019s office. You find yourself gently placed in Jin\u2019s big chair and you immediately curl yourself up.</p><p>Jin paces in front of you, back and forth across the length of the office. You can hardly focus on him, because all you want to do is cry. Maybe you are crying, you can\u2019t tell. The weight of everything happening is crushing you, and you can feel it on your shoulders as you bring your knees up to your chest, wrapping Namjoon\u2019s jacket tighter around you. You hear Jin\u2019s voice rise slightly, and you jolt as you try to listen,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think, whoever shot here won\u2019t shoot again. We know they\u2019re here, they\u2019ll assume this room is empty,\u201d Jin\u2019s saying to Namjoon, who\u2019s looking at Jin with a steely gaze. You vaguely register the broken window, unable to connect that to the gunshots right now, \u201cI just don\u2019t know how this could have happened. I wasn\u2019t even in here! I\u2019d just left. Why now? That\u2019s the question. If the shots had been just two minutes earlier- wait,\u201d He pauses and you sit up straighter, wondering what he means, \u201cTwo minutes,\u201d He mutters, like it holds some grand meaning for him. Jin goes to take another step, but lets out a sound of pure frustration, suddenly barking for Namjoon to escort you to your room for the night.</p><p>~~~</p><p>30 minutes later, you\u2019re laid on the bed next to Namjoon, wearing a set of the nicer pyjamas that you brought with you. Namjoon\u2019s holding your hand in both of his, gently rubbing his thumb against it as you talk to each other about anything that comes to mind. You stifle a yawn, but Namjoon catches it. He smiles softly and stands up, going to grab two pairs of earphones and a dual jack from his jacket. He places them on the bed before dismissing himself to the bathroom. </p><p>He soon re-enters the bedroom, now dressed in loose grey sweatpants and a tight black t-shirt that shows off his arms well. You smile at him and gesture for him to get into bed. He obliges without question, letting you rest your head on his chest as he fusses around with the earphones, so that you can both have two earphones and still share the same music. If anyone who didn\u2019t know you had walked in, they would\u2019ve thought you and Namjoon were together. But no, you\u2019re just so close that neither of you thinks twice about it,</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just listen to music and sleep. It\u2019s been a long day,\u201d Namjoon murmurs, ruffling your hair before handing you your pair of earphones. You take them with a smile and put them in, feeling sleep creep up on you as Namjoon switches on some calming music and pulls the warm covers over the both of you.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve slept at all when you hear the gunshot. You\u2019ve heard way too many in the past 24 hours for your liking. You\u2019re upright in an instant, and a quick glance at the clock tells you that it\u2019s 5am. Namjoon is right next to you, hands holding your shoulders as he tugs you a little, trying to get you to lay back down. But you won\u2019t. You\u2019re struggling against his grip, terrified that someone you know got shot. It\u2019s sickening that this sense of fear has struck you before. You try to shove Namjoon off, but he\u2019s not having it,</p><p>\u201cLook, just lay down! Jin\u2019s okay, just lay down, please!\u201d He\u2019s begging, but you barely hear over the sound of your own shouts. You\u2019re yelling for anyone you can think of in this house that you care about, wanting to know if they\u2019re okay. Namjoon\u2019s grip tightens on you, finally letting go of his composure as he shoves you down, holding you down by your shoulders as you kick and thrash, screaming for him to get off you. If you\u2019d calmed down for a second, you would\u2019ve seen the disgust written on Namjoon\u2019s face - the disgust at himself for using brute force on you - but you don\u2019t; you just keep screaming and struggling, refusing to stop until you see Jin and Jimin and even Jungkook or V, needing them to be okay.</p><p>You have no clue how much time passes before Jin comes in, eyes wide with worry, and suit jacket ruffled like he\u2019d just put it on. At the sight of your brother, you calm down a little. Namjoon lets go of you and you practically fly across the room, throwing yourself at Jin, so glad that he\u2019s okay,</p><p>\u201cI thought it was you! Jin, I was so scared, I thought it was you, I thought they came back and tried to finish you off,\u201d You tell him, tears slipping out as you repeat over and over that you thought it was him. You push back from him a little, inspecting him for any damage. That\u2019s when you see the drops of blood on his neck, smudged as if they\u2019d been partially wiped off. You push back completely, looking at him like you barely know him. Jin notices your reaction immediately and shakes his head,</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t over react, I\u2019ll explain everything if you just calm down. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019ll be calling an early meeting with my staff, but I\u2019ll leave V with you. Is that okay?\u201d Jin asks, and you\u2019re almost shocked by his soft tone. He\u2019d actually asked you this time. He hasn\u2019t done that in a long time, so you almost feel bad for what you do next. Almost.</p><p>You nod, looking at the floor until you watch Jin move past you to speak to Namjoon. In that moment, you quickly run out of the room, slamming the door behind you. The gunshot came from Jin\u2019s office, and you just know there\u2019s something he\u2019s not telling you. You don\u2019t know why you want to see, but your feet are carrying you up to the office anyway. The security door is carelessly left open, and you don\u2019t bother to ponder that, desperate to reach the office before the two shouting men behind you reach you. You\u2019re almost there, just a few steps away. Jin is yelling at you to not go in, telling you it\u2019s too much for you. You don\u2019t even consider if he\u2019s right before entering. </p><p>But he was right.</p><p>Blood. Blood is everywhere. You\u2019ve never seen so much of it in your life. It\u2019s dripping down the stark white walls, staining them red. There\u2019s lumps in it, slowly sliding down too - it\u2019s a mix of brain and skull, and you find yourself ready to throw up. Your eyes won\u2019t stop looking though, and they eventually find the crumpled body on the floor, the back of their skull gaping, with more brain matter falling out. As if that isn\u2019t enough, your legs move you forward, turning until you can see the face of the body. When you see his wide, dead eyes, the faint scream still on his lips, the dark hair that\u2019s lost all its bounce, that\u2019s now hanging limply across the messy entry wound on his forehead. Jimin\u2019s forehead,</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d You hear from behind you. Jin\u2019s voice is harsh and barely short of a yell as his rough hands grab you and pull you out of the room, not caring that your feet aren\u2019t leaving the floor. You\u2019re thrown into a seat two rooms over, and Jin\u2019s furious face is all you can see as he continues to yell, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever come up here unless you have explicit fucking permission from me or Namjoon! Do you understand?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy would I take orders from a murderer?!\u201d You scream right back, finding your voice in the same instant that your eyes find the smeared blood on your brother\u2019s neck for the second time. Jimin\u2019s blood,</p><p>\u201cYou want to hear about fucking murderers? That man, Park Jimin is a fucking murderer!\u201d Jin yells, his voice doubling in volume as he turns back to slam the door. He tries to continue shouting, but you cut him off, your voice finding a new level of volume that you didn\u2019t realise you had,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk about him like that, he\u2019s more of a brother to me than you ever have been!\u201d You scream, and that shuts Jin up instantly. The anger visibly drains from his body and his mouth closes as he pulls a chair over so that he can sit in front of you, resting his head in his hands. He rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands,</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jin mutters, surprising you. You turn to him and watch him as he takes a deep breath, clearly finding difficulty in continuing, \u201cI know I haven\u2019t done right by you in a long time. But I can\u2019t help it. These people aren\u2019t who they say they are. Jimin was never ours,\u201d Jin tells you, and you frown. Part of you has already supressed the awful image of Jimin\u2019s brains all over the wall just a few metres away so you don\u2019t find it hugely difficult to push it aside in your head and listen to Jin\u2019s words, \u201cHe was always Suga\u2019s man. Working on the inside. I used him for discipline and timing things to perfection, but I never asked where he learned it from,\u201d Jin tells you, and you feel out of your depth,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You ask, trying to keep your voice calm and soothing. Jin sighs and shifts back, reaching in his trouser pocket to get a small envelope out. He holds it in his hands before continuing, slower and more calculated,</p><p>\u201cSuga. Suga\u2019s always been time perfect. I only pieced together the links between Jimin\u2019s obsession with time and Suga\u2019s timely operation after those shots today. And the fact that you smelled his cologne in my office. He\u2019s been sneaking around, under the pretence of being my close friend. Earlier, he brought you to me two minutes early. Had we stayed in that room for two more minutes, you, me, or Namjoon would be dead. His watch is off by two minutes. Do you agree?\u201d Jin asks, watching your face for your reaction. You take a deep breath and nod slowly,</p><p>\u201cBut why? Jimin has always been there for me. How could he do this to me, and to you, and to Namjoon? I thought he was one of my best friends but\u2026\u201d You trail off, unable to string together anymore words. Jin hands you the photos tentatively, and watches your face as you open them. It\u2019s a small set of polaroid photos, showing Jimin and another man around the same height. He has blonde hair, and he\u2019s pale. They\u2019re both dressed in grey sweatpants and blank tank tops, like the young men you saw training on the grounds yesterday. Jimin looks a lot younger, maybe 15 or 16. The man next to him - Suga - looks a little older, but not by much. You turn to Jin and ask what you\u2019re looking at,</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him and Suga training together. I got them anonymously on my birthday last year. I thought nothing of it at the time - that Jimin was too young to know who that man was, that this was just to mess with my head, but now\u2026\u201d Jin starts, but ends up stopping. You look at him, and see the tears in his eyes. It clicks with you that he\u2019d just killed his best friend and here he is, trying to justify it. You reach out to take his hand, your small hands not covering his, but Jin still feels the comfort in the gesture, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t been a good brother at all, but I want you to let me try. I need to brief Namjoon and take care of clean up,\u201d He shivers at the carelessness of his words, but pushes on anyway, \u201cI\u2019ll set aside some time to spend with you as soon as I can. For now, I\u2019ll call for V to stand guard outside your room,\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get him to come inside?\u201d You murmur, averting your eyes as you feel embarrassment creep up your neck and onto your cheeks, \u201cI just lost my brother. I don\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d You say, a whole host of emotions brewing inside of you. At this point, it feels like shock is the only thing keeping you going. Jin nods understandingly and stands up. He pulls out a small flip phone and taps in a few things, hits send and then puts it back in his pocket,</p><p>\u201cV will meet you outside the security door,\u201d Jin sighs, pushing his hair back with his hands, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all of this. I wish you could\u2019ve waited just 6 months to come home, but it\u2019s okay. I think we\u2019re safe now. At least for a little while,\u201d Jin admits, holding his arms out to you. You smile weakly and let him hug you. It feels weird after so long, but it\u2019s oddly comforting. Jin awkwardly pats your shoulder and pulls back, \u201cV should be outside now. I won\u2019t be ages, but I need to talk to Namjoon and make a few calls. Tell V he has permission to enter your room and do whatever it is that he does to calm people down,\u201d Jin tells you before gesturing for you to leave the room. You walk out, passing Namjoon, who\u2019s sat in the hall, eyes a little red from tears. You smile weakly as you head to the security doors, trying not to look into Jin\u2019s office.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Jin beckons Namjoon into the room when he hears the security door buzz shut. He was an idiot to leave it open in the first place. How inconsiderate was it of him to leave it open when Jimin was dead just a few metres away? He had let his emotions get the better of him, and cloud his judgement. But the moment he realised\u2026 he just completely lost control. He\u2019d killed people before but never like this. Never in cold blood. Never the second most trustworthy person in his life. </p><p>But the fact that he was now closer to his vengeance lit something within him that he knows he won\u2019t be able to stop. He\u2019s had his doubts before, wondering if he\u2019d really be able to go through with it when it came down to it, but this really was the ultimate test for him. He\u2019d thought he could trust Jimin nearly as much as he trusts Namjoon, but he was wrong. He\u2019d had his doubts about Namjoon for a few seconds, but that was impossible. He\u2019d grown up with him. And Namjoon\u2019s a terrible liar anyway.</p><p>Namjoon sits on the couch across from Jin, his hair no longer neat. His eyes are red and his breathing isn\u2019t even in any way, but it\u2019s okay. Jin understands why. He sighs and sits back on the couch, trying to come up with a sentence. But he doesn\u2019t have to. Somehow, Namjoon comes up with something first,</p><p>\u201cWhy Jimin?\u201d He asks. His voice is rough, and Jin can instantly tell that he\u2019s angry. He can\u2019t find it in himself to blame the younger man, \u201cHe never did a thing against you and you killed him in cold blood. I trusted you. I did everything you asked of me, and you repay me by killing my best friend. Why Jimin?\u201d Namjoon says again, unable to come to terms with it as easy as Jin has,</p><p>\u201cBecause he was working with Suga. That\u2019s why Hoseok just agreed to meet with us so easily. Suga knew there were no risks, because Jimin would be here. He ordered Jimin to shoot my office. He wanted us dead,\u201d Jin says, slowly and calmly. He watches Namjoon\u2019s face trying to gauge his reaction,</p><p>\u201cIs this to do with your parents?\u201d Namjoon replies simply after about 3 minutes of silence. Jin\u2019s eyebrows raise in response, and leaves a short pause to think of how to phrase his reply. He doesn\u2019t want to tell Namjoon outright what his intentions are, but he doesn\u2019t have much of a choice,</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that revolver you have stashed unceremoniously in the back of your trousers?\u201d Namjoon asks again, and Jin has to actively try not to show his shock. He didn\u2019t realise it was so obvious. It probably wasn\u2019t, to be fair. Namjoon\u2019s just good at what he does. For a long time he\u2019s been in this business, so it\u2019s not really all that surprising that he can tell who\u2019s got a gun on them and who hasn\u2019t. That\u2019s why Jin doesn\u2019t even try and deny it. He just nods, before going into the pocket of his jacket and pulling out the brass shell of a bullet. It\u2019s a little dull, but otherwise unblemished. Namjoon\u2019s eyes widen in shock, but he doesn\u2019t otherwise react,</p><p>\u201cI have 6 of these. One for each person involved with the death of my parents. I want this engraved with Jimin\u2019s name, polished, and put in my glass display case. I\u2019d ask you to do this, but I guess it\u2019s too much. He was your friend and I respect tha- \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Namjoon blurts, cutting Jin off, \u201cI\u2019ll do it if you tell me why his name is going on here. I\u2019ll do all of them, but I need to know why,\u201d Namjoon finishes, his tone strong. He always was good at ignoring his emotions. Jin sighs and places the shell in Namjoon\u2019s open palm. He hadn\u2019t wanted to lay all of his cards out so soon, but if he couldn\u2019t be honest with Namjoon, how could he be honest with himself?</p><p>\u201cHe was meant to be our guy. Jimin was supposed to be on our side, training to help me when I took over. I was going to call him to help me get through things on the night that I found my parents, but he was already there. I assumed he was in for some late night training, that he\u2019d hidden when things started, and hadn\u2019t come out until he realised it was okay but looking back\u2026 he wasn\u2019t even that shaken up. Like he\u2019d expected it. I thought it was good composure, but piecing together what I did today says otherwise. He must have just stood there, or maybe even let their killer in. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I\u2019m mostly certain. When I get to them, I\u2019ll be sure to ask,\u201d Jin promises, and he watches Namjoon nod. It\u2019s enough for him,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check on V, make sure everything\u2019s okay,\u201d Namjoon says, standing up as he slips the case into his pocket, \u201cI\u2019ll get this engraving done. I\u2019m assuming this stays within this room?\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice is emotionless and business like, but Jin knows that it\u2019s so he can pretend it doesn\u2019t matter to him,</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you. If possible, swap V out when she\u2019s asleep. She seems to prefer him, but I trust Jungkook more to watch over her during the night,\u201d Jin instructs Namjoon, standing up to face him,</p><p>\u201cThe new trainee. Jeon?\u201d Namjoon asks, clearly confused. It\u2019s not often that Jin chose to trust new recruits with important tasks,</p><p>\u201cHe argued with V over her safety before dinner. That\u2019s important to me,\u201d Jin states, his tone final. No arguments. Namjoon just nods, turning on his heel and walking out of the door, leaving Jin alone in the room with nothing but his thoughts, and his friend\u2019s dead body just 2 doors down,</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d He whispers into the silence.</p></p>",

You can\u2019t do anything but stand there as worries begin to run through your head, wondering what on earth is going on and if anyone you know - or anyone at all - is hurt. Jin\u2019s name crosses your mind with a pang to your heart, and you fall to your knees,</p><p>\u201cCome on, you have to get up! You can\u2019t stop! We need to get you inside now!\u201d Namjoon tells you, nearly shouting over the turmoil behind you. You shake your head, feeling the tears and the weight of your time here suddenly washing over you. Namjoon lets out what sounds like a growl from deep in his throat and he tears off his suit jacket and throwing it over you, as you\u2019d started shaking form worry and shock at some point. The emotions from what you\u2019ve experienced today finally get to you and Namjoon\u2019s voice fades out into the background. Vaguely you feel strong arms around you; you\u2019re not touching the floor; there\u2019s an erratic heartbeat by your ear and you can hear your own breath alongside it. Time passes around you and you barely register Namjoon taking you straight up through the mansion and to Jin\u2019s office. You find yourself gently placed in Jin\u2019s big chair and you immediately curl yourself up.</p><p>Jin paces in front of you, back and forth across the length of the office. You can hardly focus on him, because all you want to do is cry. Maybe you are crying, you can\u2019t tell. The weight of everything happening is crushing you, and you can feel it on your shoulders as you bring your knees up to your chest, wrapping Namjoon\u2019s jacket tighter around you. You hear Jin\u2019s voice rise slightly, and you jolt as you try to listen,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think, whoever shot here won\u2019t shoot again. We know they\u2019re here, they\u2019ll assume this room is empty,\u201d Jin\u2019s saying to Namjoon, who\u2019s looking at Jin with a steely gaze. You vaguely register the broken window, unable to connect that to the gunshots right now, \u201cI just don\u2019t know how this could have happened. I wasn\u2019t even in here! I\u2019d just left. Why now? That\u2019s the question. If the shots had been just two minutes earlier- wait,\u201d He pauses and you sit up straighter, wondering what he means, \u201cTwo minutes,\u201d He mutters, like it holds some grand meaning for him. Jin goes to take another step, but lets out a sound of pure frustration, suddenly barking for Namjoon to escort you to your room for the night.</p><p>~~~</p><p>30 minutes later, you\u2019re laid on the bed next to Namjoon, wearing a set of the nicer pyjamas that you brought with you. Namjoon\u2019s holding your hand in both of his, gently rubbing his thumb against it as you talk to each other about anything that comes to mind. You stifle a yawn, but Namjoon catches it. He smiles softly and stands up, going to grab two pairs of earphones and a dual jack from his jacket. He places them on the bed before dismissing himself to the bathroom. </p><p>He soon re-enters the bedroom, now dressed in loose grey sweatpants and a tight black t-shirt that shows off his arms well. You smile at him and gesture for him to get into bed. He obliges without question, letting you rest your head on his chest as he fusses around with the earphones, so that you can both have two earphones and still share the same music. If anyone who didn\u2019t know you had walked in, they would\u2019ve thought you and Namjoon were together. But no, you\u2019re just so close that neither of you thinks twice about it,</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just listen to music and sleep. It\u2019s been a long day,\u201d Namjoon murmurs, ruffling your hair before handing you your pair of earphones. You take them with a smile and put them in, feeling sleep creep up on you as Namjoon switches on some calming music and pulls the warm covers over the both of you.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve slept at all when you hear the gunshot. You\u2019ve heard way too many in the past 24 hours for your liking. You\u2019re upright in an instant, and a quick glance at the clock tells you that it\u2019s 5am. Namjoon is right next to you, hands holding your shoulders as he tugs you a little, trying to get you to lay back down. But you won\u2019t. You\u2019re struggling against his grip, terrified that someone you know got shot. It\u2019s sickening that this sense of fear has struck you before. You try to shove Namjoon off, but he\u2019s not having it,</p><p>\u201cLook, just lay down! Jin\u2019s okay, just lay down, please!\u201d He\u2019s begging, but you barely hear over the sound of your own shouts. You\u2019re yelling for anyone you can think of in this house that you care about, wanting to know if they\u2019re okay. Namjoon\u2019s grip tightens on you, finally letting go of his composure as he shoves you down, holding you down by your shoulders as you kick and thrash, screaming for him to get off you. If you\u2019d calmed down for a second, you would\u2019ve seen the disgust written on Namjoon\u2019s face - the disgust at himself for using brute force on you - but you don\u2019t; you just keep screaming and struggling, refusing to stop until you see Jin and Jimin and even Jungkook or V, needing them to be okay.</p><p>You have no clue how much time passes before Jin comes in, eyes wide with worry, and suit jacket ruffled like he\u2019d just put it on. At the sight of your brother, you calm down a little. Namjoon lets go of you and you practically fly across the room, throwing yourself at Jin, so glad that he\u2019s okay,</p><p>\u201cI thought it was you! Jin, I was so scared, I thought it was you, I thought they came back and tried to finish you off,\u201d You tell him, tears slipping out as you repeat over and over that you thought it was him. You push back from him a little, inspecting him for any damage. That\u2019s when you see the drops of blood on his neck, smudged as if they\u2019d been partially wiped off. You push back completely, looking at him like you barely know him. Jin notices your reaction immediately and shakes his head,</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t over react, I\u2019ll explain everything if you just calm down. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019ll be calling an early meeting with my staff, but I\u2019ll leave V with you. Is that okay?\u201d Jin asks, and you\u2019re almost shocked by his soft tone. He\u2019d actually asked you this time. He hasn\u2019t done that in a long time, so you almost feel bad for what you do next. Almost.</p><p>You nod, looking at the floor until you watch Jin move past you to speak to Namjoon. In that moment, you quickly run out of the room, slamming the door behind you. The gunshot came from Jin\u2019s office, and you just know there\u2019s something he\u2019s not telling you. You don\u2019t know why you want to see, but your feet are carrying you up to the office anyway. The security door is carelessly left open, and you don\u2019t bother to ponder that, desperate to reach the office before the two shouting men behind you reach you. You\u2019re almost there, just a few steps away. Jin is yelling at you to not go in, telling you it\u2019s too much for you. You don\u2019t even consider if he\u2019s right before entering. </p><p>But he was right.</p><p>Blood. Blood is everywhere. You\u2019ve never seen so much of it in your life. It\u2019s dripping down the stark white walls, staining them red. There\u2019s lumps in it, slowly sliding down too - it\u2019s a mix of brain and skull, and you find yourself ready to throw up. Your eyes won\u2019t stop looking though, and they eventually find the crumpled body on the floor, the back of their skull gaping, with more brain matter falling out. As if that isn\u2019t enough, your legs move you forward, turning until you can see the face of the body. When you see his wide, dead eyes, the faint scream still on his lips, the dark hair that\u2019s lost all its bounce, that\u2019s now hanging limply across the messy entry wound on his forehead. Jimin\u2019s forehead,</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d You hear from behind you. Jin\u2019s voice is harsh and barely short of a yell as his rough hands grab you and pull you out of the room, not caring that your feet aren\u2019t leaving the floor. You\u2019re thrown into a seat two rooms over, and Jin\u2019s furious face is all you can see as he continues to yell, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever come up here unless you have explicit fucking permission from me or Namjoon! Do you understand?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy would I take orders from a murderer?!\u201d You scream right back, finding your voice in the same instant that your eyes find the smeared blood on your brother\u2019s neck for the second time. Jimin\u2019s blood,</p><p>\u201cYou want to hear about fucking murderers? That man, Park Jimin is a fucking murderer!\u201d Jin yells, his voice doubling in volume as he turns back to slam the door. He tries to continue shouting, but you cut him off, your voice finding a new level of volume that you didn\u2019t realise you had,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk about him like that, he\u2019s more of a brother to me than you ever have been!\u201d You scream, and that shuts Jin up instantly. The anger visibly drains from his body and his mouth closes as he pulls a chair over so that he can sit in front of you, resting his head in his hands. He rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands,</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jin mutters, surprising you. You turn to him and watch him as he takes a deep breath, clearly finding difficulty in continuing, \u201cI know I haven\u2019t done right by you in a long time. But I can\u2019t help it. These people aren\u2019t who they say they are. Jimin was never ours,\u201d Jin tells you, and you frown. Part of you has already supressed the awful image of Jimin\u2019s brains all over the wall just a few metres away so you don\u2019t find it hugely difficult to push it aside in your head and listen to Jin\u2019s words, \u201cHe was always Suga\u2019s man. Working on the inside. I used him for discipline and timing things to perfection, but I never asked where he learned it from,\u201d Jin tells you, and you feel out of your depth,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You ask, trying to keep your voice calm and soothing. Jin sighs and shifts back, reaching in his trouser pocket to get a small envelope out. He holds it in his hands before continuing, slower and more calculated,</p><p>\u201cSuga. Suga\u2019s always been time perfect. I only pieced together the links between Jimin\u2019s obsession with time and Suga\u2019s timely operation after those shots today. And the fact that you smelled his cologne in my office. He\u2019s been sneaking around, under the pretence of being my close friend. Earlier, he brought you to me two minutes early. Had we stayed in that room for two more minutes, you, me, or Namjoon would be dead. His watch is off by two minutes. Do you agree?\u201d Jin asks, watching your face for your reaction. You take a deep breath and nod slowly,</p><p>\u201cBut why? Jimin has always been there for me. How could he do this to me, and to you, and to Namjoon? I thought he was one of my best friends but\u2026\u201d You trail off, unable to string together anymore words. Jin hands you the photos tentatively, and watches your face as you open them. It\u2019s a small set of polaroid photos, showing Jimin and another man around the same height. He has blonde hair, and he\u2019s pale. They\u2019re both dressed in grey sweatpants and blank tank tops, like the young men you saw training on the grounds yesterday. Jimin looks a lot younger, maybe 15 or 16. The man next to him - Suga - looks a little older, but not by much. You turn to Jin and ask what you\u2019re looking at,</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him and Suga training together. I got them anonymously on my birthday last year. I thought nothing of it at the time - that Jimin was too young to know who that man was, that this was just to mess with my head, but now\u2026\u201d Jin starts, but ends up stopping. You look at him, and see the tears in his eyes. It clicks with you that he\u2019d just killed his best friend and here he is, trying to justify it. You reach out to take his hand, your small hands not covering his, but Jin still feels the comfort in the gesture, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t been a good brother at all, but I want you to let me try. I need to brief Namjoon and take care of clean up,\u201d He shivers at the carelessness of his words, but pushes on anyway, \u201cI\u2019ll set aside some time to spend with you as soon as I can. For now, I\u2019ll call for V to stand guard outside your room,\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get him to come inside?\u201d You murmur, averting your eyes as you feel embarrassment creep up your neck and onto your cheeks, \u201cI just lost my brother. I don\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d You say, a whole host of emotions brewing inside of you. At this point, it feels like shock is the only thing keeping you going. Jin nods understandingly and stands up. He pulls out a small flip phone and taps in a few things, hits send and then puts it back in his pocket,</p><p>\u201cV will meet you outside the security door,\u201d Jin sighs, pushing his hair back with his hands, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all of this. I wish you could\u2019ve waited just 6 months to come home, but it\u2019s okay. I think we\u2019re safe now. At least for a little while,\u201d Jin admits, holding his arms out to you. You smile weakly and let him hug you. It feels weird after so long, but it\u2019s oddly comforting. Jin awkwardly pats your shoulder and pulls back, \u201cV should be outside now. I won\u2019t be ages, but I need to talk to Namjoon and make a few calls. Tell V he has permission to enter your room and do whatever it is that he does to calm people down,\u201d Jin tells you before gesturing for you to leave the room. You walk out, passing Namjoon, who\u2019s sat in the hall, eyes a little red from tears. You smile weakly as you head to the security doors, trying not to look into Jin\u2019s office.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Jin beckons Namjoon into the room when he hears the security door buzz shut. He was an idiot to leave it open in the first place. How inconsiderate was it of him to leave it open when Jimin was dead just a few metres away? He had let his emotions get the better of him, and cloud his judgement. But the moment he realised\u2026 he just completely lost control. He\u2019d killed people before but never like this. Never in cold blood. Never the second most trustworthy person in his life. </p><p>But the fact that he was now closer to his vengeance lit something within him that he knows he won\u2019t be able to stop. He\u2019s had his doubts before, wondering if he\u2019d really be able to go through with it when it came down to it, but this really was the ultimate test for him. He\u2019d thought he could trust Jimin nearly as much as he trusts Namjoon, but he was wrong. He\u2019d had his doubts about Namjoon for a few seconds, but that was impossible. He\u2019d grown up with him. And Namjoon\u2019s a terrible liar anyway.</p><p>Namjoon sits on the couch across from Jin, his hair no longer neat. His eyes are red and his breathing isn\u2019t even in any way, but it\u2019s okay. Jin understands why. He sighs and sits back on the couch, trying to come up with a sentence. But he doesn\u2019t have to. Somehow, Namjoon comes up with something first,</p><p>\u201cWhy Jimin?\u201d He asks. His voice is rough, and Jin can instantly tell that he\u2019s angry. He can\u2019t find it in himself to blame the younger man, \u201cHe never did a thing against you and you killed him in cold blood. I trusted you. I did everything you asked of me, and you repay me by killing my best friend. Why Jimin?\u201d Namjoon says again, unable to come to terms with it as easy as Jin has,</p><p>\u201cBecause he was working with Suga. That\u2019s why Hoseok just agreed to meet with us so easily. Suga knew there were no risks, because Jimin would be here. He ordered Jimin to shoot my office. He wanted us dead,\u201d Jin says, slowly and calmly. He watches Namjoon\u2019s face trying to gauge his reaction,</p><p>\u201cIs this to do with your parents?\u201d Namjoon replies simply after about 3 minutes of silence. Jin\u2019s eyebrows raise in response, and leaves a short pause to think of how to phrase his reply. He doesn\u2019t want to tell Namjoon outright what his intentions are, but he doesn\u2019t have much of a choice,</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that revolver you have stashed unceremoniously in the back of your trousers?\u201d Namjoon asks again, and Jin has to actively try not to show his shock. He didn\u2019t realise it was so obvious. It probably wasn\u2019t, to be fair. Namjoon\u2019s just good at what he does. For a long time he\u2019s been in this business, so it\u2019s not really all that surprising that he can tell who\u2019s got a gun on them and who hasn\u2019t. That\u2019s why Jin doesn\u2019t even try and deny it. He just nods, before going into the pocket of his jacket and pulling out the brass shell of a bullet. It\u2019s a little dull, but otherwise unblemished. Namjoon\u2019s eyes widen in shock, but he doesn\u2019t otherwise react,</p><p>\u201cI have 6 of these. One for each person involved with the death of my parents. I want this engraved with Jimin\u2019s name, polished, and put in my glass display case. I\u2019d ask you to do this, but I guess it\u2019s too much. He was your friend and I respect tha- \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Namjoon blurts, cutting Jin off, \u201cI\u2019ll do it if you tell me why his name is going on here. I\u2019ll do all of them, but I need to know why,\u201d Namjoon finishes, his tone strong. He always was good at ignoring his emotions. Jin sighs and places the shell in Namjoon\u2019s open palm. He hadn\u2019t wanted to lay all of his cards out so soon, but if he couldn\u2019t be honest with Namjoon, how could he be honest with himself?</p><p>\u201cHe was meant to be our guy. Jimin was supposed to be on our side, training to help me when I took over. I was going to call him to help me get through things on the night that I found my parents, but he was already there. I assumed he was in for some late night training, that he\u2019d hidden when things started, and hadn\u2019t come out until he realised it was okay but looking back\u2026 he wasn\u2019t even that shaken up. Like he\u2019d expected it. I thought it was good composure, but piecing together what I did today says otherwise. He must have just stood there, or maybe even let their killer in. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I\u2019m mostly certain. When I get to them, I\u2019ll be sure to ask,\u201d Jin promises, and he watches Namjoon nod. It\u2019s enough for him,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check on V, make sure everything\u2019s okay,\u201d Namjoon says, standing up as he slips the case into his pocket, \u201cI\u2019ll get this engraving done. I\u2019m assuming this stays within this room?\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice is emotionless and business like, but Jin knows that it\u2019s so he can pretend it doesn\u2019t matter to him,</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you. If possible, swap V out when she\u2019s asleep. She seems to prefer him, but I trust Jungkook more to watch over her during the night,\u201d Jin instructs Namjoon, standing up to face him,</p><p>\u201cThe new trainee. Jeon?\u201d Namjoon asks, clearly confused. It\u2019s not often that Jin chose to trust new recruits with important tasks,</p><p>\u201cHe argued with V over her safety before dinner. That\u2019s important to me,\u201d Jin states, his tone final. No arguments. Namjoon just nods, turning on his heel and walking out of the door, leaving Jin alone in the room with nothing but his thoughts, and his friend\u2019s dead body just 2 doors down,</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d He whispers into the silence.</p></p>",

You can&rsquo;t do anything but stand there as worries begin to run through your head, wondering what on earth is going on and if anyone you know - or anyone at all - is hurt. Jin&rsquo;s name crosses your mind with a pang to your heart, and you fall to your knees,</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, you have to get up! You can&rsquo;t stop! We need to get you inside now!&rdquo; Namjoon tells you, nearly shouting over the turmoil behind you. You shake your head, feeling the tears and the weight of your time here suddenly washing over you. Namjoon lets out what sounds like a growl from deep in his throat and he tears off his suit jacket and throwing it over you, as you&rsquo;d started shaking form worry and shock at some point. The emotions from what you&rsquo;ve experienced today finally get to you and Namjoon&rsquo;s voice fades out into the background. Vaguely you feel strong arms around you; you&rsquo;re not touching the floor; there&rsquo;s an erratic heartbeat by your ear and you can hear your own breath alongside it. Time passes around you and you barely register Namjoon taking you straight up through the mansion and to Jin&rsquo;s office. You find yourself gently placed in Jin&rsquo;s big chair and you immediately curl yourself up.</p><p>Jin paces in front of you, back and forth across the length of the office. You can hardly focus on him, because all you want to do is cry. Maybe you are crying, you can&rsquo;t tell. The weight of everything happening is crushing you, and you can feel it on your shoulders as you bring your knees up to your chest, wrapping Namjoon&rsquo;s jacket tighter around you. You hear Jin&rsquo;s voice rise slightly, and you jolt as you try to listen,</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you think, whoever shot here won&rsquo;t shoot again. We know they&rsquo;re here, they&rsquo;ll assume this room is empty,&rdquo; Jin&rsquo;s saying to Namjoon, who&rsquo;s looking at Jin with a steely gaze. You vaguely register the broken window, unable to connect that to the gunshots right now, &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know how this could have happened. I wasn&rsquo;t even in here! I&rsquo;d just left. Why now? That&rsquo;s the question. If the shots had been just two minutes earlier- wait,&rdquo; He pauses and you sit up straighter, wondering what he means, &ldquo;Two minutes,&rdquo; He mutters, like it holds some grand meaning for him. Jin goes to take another step, but lets out a sound of pure frustration, suddenly barking for Namjoon to escort you to your room for the night.</p><p>~~~</p><p>30 minutes later, you&rsquo;re laid on the bed next to Namjoon, wearing a set of the nicer pyjamas that you brought with you. Namjoon&rsquo;s holding your hand in both of his, gently rubbing his thumb against it as you talk to each other about anything that comes to mind. You stifle a yawn, but Namjoon catches it. He smiles softly and stands up, going to grab two pairs of earphones and a dual jack from his jacket. He places them on the bed before dismissing himself to the bathroom. </p><p>He soon re-enters the bedroom, now dressed in loose grey sweatpants and a tight black t-shirt that shows off his arms well. You smile at him and gesture for him to get into bed. He obliges without question, letting you rest your head on his chest as he fusses around with the earphones, so that you can both have two earphones and still share the same music. If anyone who didn&rsquo;t know you had walked in, they would&rsquo;ve thought you and Namjoon were together. But no, you&rsquo;re just so close that neither of you thinks twice about it,</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just listen to music and sleep. It&rsquo;s been a long day,&rdquo; Namjoon murmurs, ruffling your hair before handing you your pair of earphones. You take them with a smile and put them in, feeling sleep creep up on you as Namjoon switches on some calming music and pulls the warm covers over the both of you.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;ve slept at all when you hear the gunshot. You&rsquo;ve heard way too many in the past 24 hours for your liking. You&rsquo;re upright in an instant, and a quick glance at the clock tells you that it&rsquo;s 5am. Namjoon is right next to you, hands holding your shoulders as he tugs you a little, trying to get you to lay back down. But you won&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re struggling against his grip, terrified that someone you know got shot. It&rsquo;s sickening that this sense of fear has struck you before. You try to shove Namjoon off, but he&rsquo;s not having it,</p><p>&ldquo;Look, just lay down! Jin&rsquo;s okay, just lay down, please!&rdquo; He&rsquo;s begging, but you barely hear over the sound of your own shouts. You&rsquo;re yelling for anyone you can think of in this house that you care about, wanting to know if they&rsquo;re okay. Namjoon&rsquo;s grip tightens on you, finally letting go of his composure as he shoves you down, holding you down by your shoulders as you kick and thrash, screaming for him to get off you. If you&rsquo;d calmed down for a second, you would&rsquo;ve seen the disgust written on Namjoon&rsquo;s face - the disgust at himself for using brute force on you - but you don&rsquo;t; you just keep screaming and struggling, refusing to stop until you see Jin and Jimin and even Jungkook or V, needing them to be okay.</p><p>You have no clue how much time passes before Jin comes in, eyes wide with worry, and suit jacket ruffled like he&rsquo;d just put it on. At the sight of your brother, you calm down a little. Namjoon lets go of you and you practically fly across the room, throwing yourself at Jin, so glad that he&rsquo;s okay,</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was you! Jin, I was so scared, I thought it was you, I thought they came back and tried to finish you off,&rdquo; You tell him, tears slipping out as you repeat over and over that you thought it was him. You push back from him a little, inspecting him for any damage. That&rsquo;s when you see the drops of blood on his neck, smudged as if they&rsquo;d been partially wiped off. You push back completely, looking at him like you barely know him. Jin notices your reaction immediately and shakes his head,</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t over react, I&rsquo;ll explain everything if you just calm down. I&rsquo;m okay. I&rsquo;m not hurt. I&rsquo;ll be calling an early meeting with my staff, but I&rsquo;ll leave V with you. Is that okay?&rdquo; Jin asks, and you&rsquo;re almost shocked by his soft tone. He&rsquo;d actually asked you this time. He hasn&rsquo;t done that in a long time, so you almost feel bad for what you do next. Almost.</p><p>You nod, looking at the floor until you watch Jin move past you to speak to Namjoon. In that moment, you quickly run out of the room, slamming the door behind you. The gunshot came from Jin&rsquo;s office, and you just know there&rsquo;s something he&rsquo;s not telling you. You don&rsquo;t know why you want to see, but your feet are carrying you up to the office anyway. The security door is carelessly left open, and you don&rsquo;t bother to ponder that, desperate to reach the office before the two shouting men behind you reach you. You&rsquo;re almost there, just a few steps away. Jin is yelling at you to not go in, telling you it&rsquo;s too much for you. You don&rsquo;t even consider if he&rsquo;s right before entering. </p><p>But he was right.</p><p>Blood. Blood is everywhere. You&rsquo;ve never seen so much of it in your life. It&rsquo;s dripping down the stark white walls, staining them red. There&rsquo;s lumps in it, slowly sliding down too - it&rsquo;s a mix of brain and skull, and you find yourself ready to throw up. Your eyes won&rsquo;t stop looking though, and they eventually find the crumpled body on the floor, the back of their skull gaping, with more brain matter falling out. As if that isn&rsquo;t enough, your legs move you forward, turning until you can see the face of the body. When you see his wide, dead eyes, the faint scream still on his lips, the dark hair that&rsquo;s lost all its bounce, that&rsquo;s now hanging limply across the messy entry wound on his forehead. Jimin&rsquo;s forehead,</p><p>&ldquo;What in the hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing?!&rdquo; You hear from behind you. Jin&rsquo;s voice is harsh and barely short of a yell as his rough hands grab you and pull you out of the room, not caring that your feet aren&rsquo;t leaving the floor. You&rsquo;re thrown into a seat two rooms over, and Jin&rsquo;s furious face is all you can see as he continues to yell, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever come up here unless you have explicit fucking permission from me or Namjoon! Do you understand?!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why would I take orders from a murderer?!&rdquo; You scream right back, finding your voice in the same instant that your eyes find the smeared blood on your brother&rsquo;s neck for the second time. Jimin&rsquo;s blood,</p><p>&ldquo;You want to hear about fucking murderers? That man, Park Jimin is a fucking murderer!&rdquo; Jin yells, his voice doubling in volume as he turns back to slam the door. He tries to continue shouting, but you cut him off, your voice finding a new level of volume that you didn&rsquo;t realise you had,</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk about him like that, he&rsquo;s more of a brother to me than you ever have been!&rdquo; You scream, and that shuts Jin up instantly. The anger visibly drains from his body and his mouth closes as he pulls a chair over so that he can sit in front of you, resting his head in his hands. He rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands,</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jin mutters, surprising you. You turn to him and watch him as he takes a deep breath, clearly finding difficulty in continuing, &ldquo;I know I haven&rsquo;t done right by you in a long time. But I can&rsquo;t help it. These people aren&rsquo;t who they say they are. Jimin was never ours,&rdquo; Jin tells you, and you frown. Part of you has already supressed the awful image of Jimin&rsquo;s brains all over the wall just a few metres away so you don&rsquo;t find it hugely difficult to push it aside in your head and listen to Jin&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;He was always Suga&rsquo;s man. Working on the inside. I used him for discipline and timing things to perfection, but I never asked where he learned it from,&rdquo; Jin tells you, and you feel out of your depth,</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; You ask, trying to keep your voice calm and soothing. Jin sighs and shifts back, reaching in his trouser pocket to get a small envelope out. He holds it in his hands before continuing, slower and more calculated,</p><p>&ldquo;Suga. Suga&rsquo;s always been time perfect. I only pieced together the links between Jimin&rsquo;s obsession with time and Suga&rsquo;s timely operation after those shots today. And the fact that you smelled his cologne in my office. He&rsquo;s been sneaking around, under the pretence of being my close friend. Earlier, he brought you to me two minutes early. Had we stayed in that room for two more minutes, you, me, or Namjoon would be dead. His watch is off by two minutes. Do you agree?&rdquo; Jin asks, watching your face for your reaction. You take a deep breath and nod slowly,</p><p>&ldquo;But why? Jimin has always been there for me. How could he do this to me, and to you, and to Namjoon? I thought he was one of my best friends but&hellip;&rdquo; You trail off, unable to string together anymore words. Jin hands you the photos tentatively, and watches your face as you open them. It&rsquo;s a small set of polaroid photos, showing Jimin and another man around the same height. He has blonde hair, and he&rsquo;s pale. They&rsquo;re both dressed in grey sweatpants and blank tank tops, like the young men you saw training on the grounds yesterday. Jimin looks a lot younger, maybe 15 or 16. The man next to him - Suga - looks a little older, but not by much. You turn to Jin and ask what you&rsquo;re looking at,</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him and Suga training together. I got them anonymously on my birthday last year. I thought nothing of it at the time - that Jimin was too young to know who that man was, that this was just to mess with my head, but now&hellip;&rdquo; Jin starts, but ends up stopping. You look at him, and see the tears in his eyes. It clicks with you that he&rsquo;d just killed his best friend and here he is, trying to justify it. You reach out to take his hand, your small hands not covering his, but Jin still feels the comfort in the gesture, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I haven&rsquo;t been a good brother at all, but I want you to let me try. I need to brief Namjoon and take care of clean up,&rdquo; He shivers at the carelessness of his words, but pushes on anyway, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set aside some time to spend with you as soon as I can. For now, I&rsquo;ll call for V to stand guard outside your room,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get him to come inside?&rdquo; You murmur, averting your eyes as you feel embarrassment creep up your neck and onto your cheeks, &ldquo;I just lost my brother. I don&rsquo;t want to be alone,&rdquo; You say, a whole host of emotions brewing inside of you. At this point, it feels like shock is the only thing keeping you going. Jin nods understandingly and stands up. He pulls out a small flip phone and taps in a few things, hits send and then puts it back in his pocket,</p><p>&ldquo;V will meet you outside the security door,&rdquo; Jin sighs, pushing his hair back with his hands, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about all of this. I wish you could&rsquo;ve waited just 6 months to come home, but it&rsquo;s okay. I think we&rsquo;re safe now. At least for a little while,&rdquo; Jin admits, holding his arms out to you. You smile weakly and let him hug you. It feels weird after so long, but it&rsquo;s oddly comforting. Jin awkwardly pats your shoulder and pulls back, &ldquo;V should be outside now. I won&rsquo;t be ages, but I need to talk to Namjoon and make a few calls. Tell V he has permission to enter your room and do whatever it is that he does to calm people down,&rdquo; Jin tells you before gesturing for you to leave the room. You walk out, passing Namjoon, who&rsquo;s sat in the hall, eyes a little red from tears. You smile weakly as you head to the security doors, trying not to look into Jin&rsquo;s office.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Jin beckons Namjoon into the room when he hears the security door buzz shut. He was an idiot to leave it open in the first place. How inconsiderate was it of him to leave it open when Jimin was dead just a few metres away? He had let his emotions get the better of him, and cloud his judgement. But the moment he realised&hellip; he just completely lost control. He&rsquo;d killed people before but never like this. Never in cold blood. Never the second most trustworthy person in his life. </p><p>But the fact that he was now closer to his vengeance lit something within him that he knows he won&rsquo;t be able to stop. He&rsquo;s had his doubts before, wondering if he&rsquo;d really be able to go through with it when it came down to it, but this really was the ultimate test for him. He&rsquo;d thought he could trust Jimin nearly as much as he trusts Namjoon, but he was wrong. He&rsquo;d had his doubts about Namjoon for a few seconds, but that was impossible. He&rsquo;d grown up with him. And Namjoon&rsquo;s a terrible liar anyway.</p><p>Namjoon sits on the couch across from Jin, his hair no longer neat. His eyes are red and his breathing isn&rsquo;t even in any way, but it&rsquo;s okay. Jin understands why. He sighs and sits back on the couch, trying to come up with a sentence. But he doesn&rsquo;t have to. Somehow, Namjoon comes up with something first,</p><p>&ldquo;Why Jimin?&rdquo; He asks. His voice is rough, and Jin can instantly tell that he&rsquo;s angry. He can&rsquo;t find it in himself to blame the younger man, &ldquo;He never did a thing against you and you killed him in cold blood. I trusted you. I did everything you asked of me, and you repay me by killing my best friend. Why Jimin?&rdquo; Namjoon says again, unable to come to terms with it as easy as Jin has,</p><p>&ldquo;Because he was working with Suga. That&rsquo;s why Hoseok just agreed to meet with us so easily. Suga knew there were no risks, because Jimin would be here. He ordered Jimin to shoot my office. He wanted us dead,&rdquo; Jin says, slowly and calmly. He watches Namjoon&rsquo;s face trying to gauge his reaction,</p><p>&ldquo;Is this to do with your parents?&rdquo; Namjoon replies simply after about 3 minutes of silence. Jin&rsquo;s eyebrows raise in response, and leaves a short pause to think of how to phrase his reply. He doesn&rsquo;t want to tell Namjoon outright what his intentions are, but he doesn&rsquo;t have much of a choice,</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that revolver you have stashed unceremoniously in the back of your trousers?&rdquo; Namjoon asks again, and Jin has to actively try not to show his shock. He didn&rsquo;t realise it was so obvious. It probably wasn&rsquo;t, to be fair. Namjoon&rsquo;s just good at what he does. For a long time he&rsquo;s been in this business, so it&rsquo;s not really all that surprising that he can tell who&rsquo;s got a gun on them and who hasn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why Jin doesn&rsquo;t even try and deny it. He just nods, before going into the pocket of his jacket and pulling out the brass shell of a bullet. It&rsquo;s a little dull, but otherwise unblemished. Namjoon&rsquo;s eyes widen in shock, but he doesn&rsquo;t otherwise react,</p><p>&ldquo;I have 6 of these. One for each person involved with the death of my parents. I want this engraved with Jimin&rsquo;s name, polished, and put in my glass display case. I&rsquo;d ask you to do this, but I guess it&rsquo;s too much. He was your friend and I respect tha- &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Namjoon blurts, cutting Jin off, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it if you tell me why his name is going on here.

It&rsquo;s enough for him,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check on V, make sure everything&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Namjoon says, standing up as he slips the case into his pocket, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get this engraving done.

Namjoon just nods, turning on his heel and walking out of the door, leaving Jin alone in the room with nothing but his thoughts, and his friend&rsquo;s dead body just 2 doors down,</p><p>&ldquo;Six,&rdquo; He whispers into the silence.</p></p>",
