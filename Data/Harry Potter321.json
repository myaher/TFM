        "body": "<p><i>Note: Hello dear people of Tumblr! This is not my first fic but it\u2019s my first fic in the Harry Potter universe. I\u2019ve been fascinated by the Marauders lately and I wanted to create the story I couldn\u2019t find. It takes place during their 5th year at Hogwarts and for now it\u2019s from Marlene McKinnon\u2019s POV. Please note that this is my vision of the events and that sometimes it will be different from the cannon. I try to be as faithful to the characters as I can though. Note also that English is not my native language and I might make mistakes (that I would love to correct).\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m here because I want to be a more active part in this fandom I\u2019ve loved since I\u2019m 12 years-old. I hope that you\u2019ll enjoy this!!</i></p><p><i>Characters are not mine and belong to J.K. Rowling. May she forgive me for my bad writing as I (almost) forgive her for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.</i></p><p><b>Warnings : NONE for now (the only warning is that I can\u2019t find titles these days. WHY?)</b></p><p>It\nwas another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nAnother year for Marlene to try to succeed in her classes and exams\nso that her parents would be proud. And another year for her to fail.\nMarlene McKinnon had been a student for five years and even though\nshe never felt happier than when she was in Hogwarts she felt anxiety\ncreeping inside her chest. She was walking in the Hogwarts Express\ntrying to find the carriage her friends were in. She still had not\nfound them. \n</p><p>\n\tHer\nlong straight blond hair were tied in a messy bun at the top of her\nhead. She was wearing a long woolen black jumper she had stolen to\nher mother. She could still smell her perfume and it relaxed her. She\nliked the way the sleeves covered her hands and how it allowed her to\nhide. She was not her school self yet and she felt that she needed\nthe protection. Not that she was pretending to be someone else when\nshe was at school but when she arrived to the castle the first time\nshe had decided she wanted to live the \u201cHogwarts experience\u201d to\nits fullest and so every time her brain told her to slow down or stop\nshe had done otherwise. One would have thought she would have made a\nperfect Gryffindor but the Sorting Hat had known. Her loyalty and\ngenerosity were bigger than her bravery. She was a true Hufflepuff.\nShe wasn&rsquo;t really surprised when it happened. None of her family had\nbeen sent to the same house even if the majority of them went to\nGryffindor. Her parents valued their children&rsquo;s individual\npersonality and never prevented them from showing them. \u00a0They were\nstrong individuals only made stronger when together. She believed it\nwas what would save them from the growing darkness. \n</p><p>\n\tIt\nwas the same with her friends. She had only one close friend in\nHufflepuff : Mary Macdonald. They had met during their first year and\nMary was as shy as Marlene was loud. Mary was always there to help\nMarlene with her homework and also with the troubles she was always\ngetting herself into. Marlene was tall and blond and Mary was short\nand had curly dark hair that she tied the best way she could. Her\nhair was the only messy thing about her. \n</p><p>\n\tThe\nother person she immediately connected with was a Ravenclaw girl\ncalled Dorcas Meadowes. Dorcas was the most brilliant girl Marlene\nhad ever met. She knew everything about anything and yet she never\nbragged about it. Despite this and the fact that her hair was brown\nshe was the spitting image of Marlene. Well there was another slight\ndifference. When Marlene was loud it was mostly to defend herself or\nher friends whereas Dorcas was loud to defend anyone or anything that\nneeded to be defended. \n</p><p>\n\tFinally\nLily Evans. Even if they had met during their first year they really\nstarted getting along the year after when they became partners for\ntheir Potion class. Marlene was really bad at potions. Lily knew that\nand decided to be her partner, someone would say her tutor, for the\nrest of the year. Marlene had been helpful too. For Lily, being\nMarlene&rsquo;s friend meant that as long as she was around, James Potter\nwouldn&rsquo;t bother her. And <i>this </i>meant\nthe world to her. \n</p><p>\n\tJames\nPotter. What could Marlene say about the famous James Potter? She\nknew what the Gryffindor would say about himself. That he was the\nmost handsome and talented Quidditch player the world had ever\nbeheld. She also knew he was more than that. She liked him more than\nshe would tell him. Or tell Lily for that matter. He was fun to be\naround and really nice too. His feelings towards Lily were deep and\nsincere and given the chance she was sure he could make her happy. \n</p><p>\n\tJames\nwas always hanging out with three other boys so Marlene learned to\ndeal with them as well. Sirius Black was \u2026 <i>how to say\nthat</i> \u2026 well he was <i>something</i>.\nIt seemed that this boy had decided to turn against everything his\nfamily had believed in for generations. Not that it was a bad thing\nbut Marlene had no idea how this could end well for him. And even if\nshe could never admit it, she cared about him. \n</p><p>\n\tRemus\nLupin was a mystery. He looked shy and demure but he was often the\ncreative mind behind most of the boys&rsquo; pranks. Something dark was\nhiding behind the boy&rsquo;s scars. Something Marlene would like to know,\nnot just out of curiosity but also because she felt the need to\nprotect him.</p><p>\n\tLast\nbut not least Peter Pettigrew. No, I&rsquo;m kidding. There was not much to\nsay about Peter and Marlene couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for him. It\nmust be hard for the quiet boy to always be the sidekick, the one\nreally cared about.</p><p>\n\tMarlene\nwas getting closer to the last carriage and still there was no sign\nof her friends. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nwell isn&rsquo;t it Miss McKinnon herself without the rest of her court?\u201d\nShe heard a voice behind her. A voice she knew well.</p><p>\n\u201cSirius\nBlack. You&rsquo;re one to talk.\u201d She turned to face him and couldn&rsquo;t\nkeep herself from smiling when she saw him. \u201cWhere are your\nfriends?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\n\u201cWell\nRemus is with Lily and the rest of the prefects. James is looking for\nfood or so he says. I bet he&rsquo;s lurking around the prefect section\nwaiting for Lily to come out. Peter is with him. You know how he gets\nwhen someone mentions food.\u201d He laughed at this. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\nhad totally forgotten about the prefect thing. That&rsquo;s why the girls\nweren&rsquo;t around.\u201d She thought out loud.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nwill be my pleasure to keep you company.\u201d He said putting his arm\naround her shoulders. She shrugged him away but she was smiling. \n</p><p>\n\u201cAs\nlong as you keep your hands to yourself.\u201d She told him.</p><p>\n\tThey\nfinally found some empty place and began talking about their summer.\nSirius had spent his in his parents&rsquo; house until he couldn&rsquo;t bear it\nany more. Which is why he invited himself in the Potters&rsquo; house on\nthe second day of Summer. He laughed when saying this but it was\nclearly visible that he felt pain about it. Marlene wished she could\nhave taken this pain away. She felt bad to have such a big and caring\nfamily and he had nobody of his own blood to love. Even his\nrelationship with his brother Regulus had become worse to the point\nthat they didn&rsquo;t talk to each other. Regulus looked a lot like Sirius\nexcept a younger and more serious (pun not intended) version of him.</p><p>\n\tRegulus\nwas in Slytherin to the great happiness of his parentss. He had\nsucceeded everywhere Sirius had failed. He believed in the same <i>Pure\nBlood </i>nonsense his family\nbelieved in. It had led him to meet and spend his time with people\nMarlene would never talk to except to yell at them maybe. Rumours\nsaid that they all followed the rules of one wizard. A wizard who was\nwell trained in Dark Magic. She didn&rsquo;t want to believe that anyone\nstudying at Hogwarts could turn to Dark Magic. That was her\nHufflepuff side talking. Sirius would certainly laugh at her if she\ntold him what she thought.</p><p>\n\tThey\nhad been talking for the past half hour when the rest of the group\njoined them. The landscape outside had changed from big cities to\nsmall towns and finally to miles and miles of countryside.

WHY?)</b></p><p>It\nwas another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nAnother year for Marlene to try to succeed in her classes and exams\nso that her parents would be proud. And another year for her to fail.\nMarlene McKinnon had been a student for five years and even though\nshe never felt happier than when she was in Hogwarts she felt anxiety\ncreeping inside her chest. She was walking in the Hogwarts Express\ntrying to find the carriage her friends were in. She still had not\nfound them. \n</p><p>\n\tHer\nlong straight blond hair were tied in a messy bun at the top of her\nhead. She was wearing a long woolen black jumper she had stolen to\nher mother. She could still smell her perfume and it relaxed her. She\nliked the way the sleeves covered her hands and how it allowed her to\nhide. She was not her school self yet and she felt that she needed\nthe protection. Not that she was pretending to be someone else when\nshe was at school but when she arrived to the castle the first time\nshe had decided she wanted to live the \u201cHogwarts experience\u201d to\nits fullest and so every time her brain told her to slow down or stop\nshe had done otherwise. One would have thought she would have made a\nperfect Gryffindor but the Sorting Hat had known. Her loyalty and\ngenerosity were bigger than her bravery. She was a true Hufflepuff.\nShe wasn\u2019t really surprised when it happened. None of her family had\nbeen sent to the same house even if the majority of them went to\nGryffindor. Her parents valued their children\u2019s individual\npersonality and never prevented them from showing them. \u00a0They were\nstrong individuals only made stronger when together. She believed it\nwas what would save them from the growing darkness. \n</p><p>\n\tIt\nwas the same with her friends. She had only one close friend in\nHufflepuff : Mary Macdonald. They had met during their first year and\nMary was as shy as Marlene was loud. Mary was always there to help\nMarlene with her homework and also with the troubles she was always\ngetting herself into. Marlene was tall and blond and Mary was short\nand had curly dark hair that she tied the best way she could. Her\nhair was the only messy thing about her. \n</p><p>\n\tThe\nother person she immediately connected with was a Ravenclaw girl\ncalled Dorcas Meadowes. Dorcas was the most brilliant girl Marlene\nhad ever met. She knew everything about anything and yet she never\nbragged about it. Despite this and the fact that her hair was brown\nshe was the spitting image of Marlene. Well there was another slight\ndifference. When Marlene was loud it was mostly to defend herself or\nher friends whereas Dorcas was loud to defend anyone or anything that\nneeded to be defended. \n</p><p>\n\tFinally\nLily Evans. Even if they had met during their first year they really\nstarted getting along the year after when they became partners for\ntheir Potion class. Marlene was really bad at potions. Lily knew that\nand decided to be her partner, someone would say her tutor, for the\nrest of the year. Marlene had been helpful too. For Lily, being\nMarlene\u2019s friend meant that as long as she was around, James Potter\nwouldn\u2019t bother her. And <i>this </i>meant\nthe world to her. \n</p><p>\n\tJames\nPotter. What could Marlene say about the famous James Potter? She\nknew what the Gryffindor would say about himself. That he was the\nmost handsome and talented Quidditch player the world had ever\nbeheld. She also knew he was more than that. She liked him more than\nshe would tell him. Or tell Lily for that matter. He was fun to be\naround and really nice too. His feelings towards Lily were deep and\nsincere and given the chance she was sure he could make her happy. \n</p><p>\n\tJames\nwas always hanging out with three other boys so Marlene learned to\ndeal with them as well. Sirius Black was \u2026 <i>how to say\nthat</i> \u2026 well he was <i>something</i>.\nIt seemed that this boy had decided to turn against everything his\nfamily had believed in for generations. Not that it was a bad thing\nbut Marlene had no idea how this could end well for him. And even if\nshe could never admit it, she cared about him. \n</p><p>\n\tRemus\nLupin was a mystery. He looked shy and demure but he was often the\ncreative mind behind most of the boys\u2019 pranks. Something dark was\nhiding behind the boy\u2019s scars. Something Marlene would like to know,\nnot just out of curiosity but also because she felt the need to\nprotect him.</p><p>\n\tLast\nbut not least Peter Pettigrew. No, I\u2019m kidding. There was not much to\nsay about Peter and Marlene couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for him. It\nmust be hard for the quiet boy to always be the sidekick, the one\nreally cared about.</p><p>\n\tMarlene\nwas getting closer to the last carriage and still there was no sign\nof her friends. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nwell isn\u2019t it Miss McKinnon herself without the rest of her court?\u201d\nShe heard a voice behind her. A voice she knew well.</p><p>\n\u201cSirius\nBlack. You\u2019re one to talk.\u201d She turned to face him and couldn\u2019t\nkeep herself from smiling when she saw him. \u201cWhere are your\nfriends?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\n\u201cWell\nRemus is with Lily and the rest of the prefects. James is looking for\nfood or so he says. I bet he\u2019s lurking around the prefect section\nwaiting for Lily to come out. Peter is with him. You know how he gets\nwhen someone mentions food.\u201d He laughed at this. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\nhad totally forgotten about the prefect thing. That\u2019s why the girls\nweren\u2019t around.\u201d She thought out loud.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nwill be my pleasure to keep you company.\u201d He said putting his arm\naround her shoulders. She shrugged him away but she was smiling. \n</p><p>\n\u201cAs\nlong as you keep your hands to yourself.\u201d She told him.</p><p>\n\tThey\nfinally found some empty place and began talking about their summer.\nSirius had spent his in his parents\u2019 house until he couldn\u2019t bear it\nany more. Which is why he invited himself in the Potters\u2019 house on\nthe second day of Summer. He laughed when saying this but it was\nclearly visible that he felt pain about it. Marlene wished she could\nhave taken this pain away. She felt bad to have such a big and caring\nfamily and he had nobody of his own blood to love. Even his\nrelationship with his brother Regulus had become worse to the point\nthat they didn\u2019t talk to each other. Regulus looked a lot like Sirius\nexcept a younger and more serious (pun not intended) version of him.</p><p>\n\tRegulus\nwas in Slytherin to the great happiness of his parentss. He had\nsucceeded everywhere Sirius had failed. He believed in the same <i>Pure\nBlood </i>nonsense his family\nbelieved in. It had led him to meet and spend his time with people\nMarlene would never talk to except to yell at them maybe. Rumours\nsaid that they all followed the rules of one wizard. A wizard who was\nwell trained in Dark Magic. She didn\u2019t want to believe that anyone\nstudying at Hogwarts could turn to Dark Magic. That was her\nHufflepuff side talking. Sirius would certainly laugh at her if she\ntold him what she thought.</p><p>\n\tThey\nhad been talking for the past half hour when the rest of the group\njoined them. The landscape outside had changed from big cities to\nsmall towns and finally to miles and miles of countryside. The sun\nwas slowly getting lower in the sky and the heat was starting to\ndecrease as well. It was a good thing, Marlene thought because they\nwere too many in this carriage and it felt too hot.

Something Marlene would like to know,\nnot just out of curiosity but also because she felt the need to\nprotect him.</p><p>\n\tLast\nbut not least Peter Pettigrew. No, I&rsquo;m kidding. There was not much to\nsay about Peter and Marlene couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for him. It\nmust be hard for the quiet boy to always be the sidekick, the one\nreally cared about.</p><p>\n\tMarlene\nwas getting closer to the last carriage and still there was no sign\nof her friends. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well,\nwell isn&rsquo;t it Miss McKinnon herself without the rest of her court?&rdquo;\nShe heard a voice behind her. A voice she knew well.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Sirius\nBlack. You&rsquo;re one to talk.&rdquo; She turned to face him and couldn&rsquo;t\nkeep herself from smiling when she saw him. &ldquo;Where are your\nfriends?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well\nRemus is with Lily and the rest of the prefects. James is looking for\nfood or so he says. I bet he&rsquo;s lurking around the prefect section\nwaiting for Lily to come out. Peter is with him. You know how he gets\nwhen someone mentions food.&rdquo; He laughed at this. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nhad totally forgotten about the prefect thing. That&rsquo;s why the girls\nweren&rsquo;t around.&rdquo; She thought out loud.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It\nwill be my pleasure to keep you company.&rdquo; He said putting his arm\naround her shoulders. She shrugged him away but she was smiling. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;As\nlong as you keep your hands to yourself.&rdquo; She told him.</p><p>\n\tThey\nfinally found some empty place and began talking about their summer.\nSirius had spent his in his parents&rsquo; house until he couldn&rsquo;t bear it\nany more. Which is why he invited himself in the Potters&rsquo; house on\nthe second day of Summer. He laughed when saying this but it was\nclearly visible that he felt pain about it. Marlene wished she could\nhave taken this pain away. She felt bad to have such a big and caring\nfamily and he had nobody of his own blood to love. Even his\nrelationship with his brother Regulus had become worse to the point\nthat they didn&rsquo;t talk to each other. Regulus looked a lot like Sirius\nexcept a younger and more serious (pun not intended) version of him.</p><p>\n\tRegulus\nwas in Slytherin to the great happiness of his parentss. He had\nsucceeded everywhere Sirius had failed. He believed in the same <i>Pure\nBlood </i>nonsense his family\nbelieved in. It had led him to meet and spend his time with people\nMarlene would never talk to except to yell at them maybe. Rumours\nsaid that they all followed the rules of one wizard. A wizard who was\nwell trained in Dark Magic. She didn&rsquo;t want to believe that anyone\nstudying at Hogwarts could turn to Dark Magic. That was her\nHufflepuff side talking. Sirius would certainly laugh at her if she\ntold him what she thought.</p><p>\n\tThey\nhad been talking for the past half hour when the rest of the group\njoined them. The landscape outside had changed from big cities to\nsmall towns and finally to miles and miles of countryside. The sun\nwas slowly getting lower in the sky and the heat was starting to\ndecrease as well. It was a good thing, Marlene thought because they\nwere too many in this carriage and it felt too hot. She felt better\nthough because she was surrounded by her friends. They were talking\nof many things and the sound of the conversations made Marlene\nsleepy. Her head slowly fell on someone&rsquo;s shoulder and it was only\nwhen she woke up as the train was slowing down that she realised that\nthe shoulder she had slept on all this time was Sirius&rsquo;. What was\neven more awkward was that he hadn&rsquo;t moved and he wasn&rsquo;t making any\nclever remarks about it. As she was getting off the train she thought\nthat this year would be full of surprises. She just couldn&rsquo;t wait. \n</p>",

Ayala, she, 15, Jewish, lives in Israel, speaks Hebrew, draw way too much, Slytherin, ROTBTD fangirl, firebender, obsessed with green color, in love with prince Zuko, Jack Frost, Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the third, and a lot more fictional characters. Watching Tangled the Series and enjoy drawing angst Varian from time to time. Cassarian, Jelsa and Hiccstrid, though I'm also a multishiper. \nI will be publishing my art (and probably rebloging a lot of other stuff) in here. Enjoy^^ \n\nhttps://jewishicequeen.tumblr.com/search/ayala's%20art",
