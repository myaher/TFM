I get to sit on the sidelines, laughing at how f*cked those marriages are from the get-go. Is that \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cemotionally intelligent\u201d\u2019of me? No, but you\u2019re not my shrink and she and I have a whole boatload of other issues of mine to tackle before we address why I shame people for their doomed relationships. Anyway, here are some of the trashiest celebrity weddings of all time. And fun fact: more than half of these weddings also have leaked sex tapes. Not really material to the article, I just thought it was an interesting correlation.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>1. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/hunterschwarz/the-definitive-britney-spears-weddings-photo-alb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Britney Spears and Kevin Federline</a></h2>\n<p>Britney famously got married in Las Vegas to some high school friend of hers, and she somehow managed to get trashier than that at her next wedding. How, you wonder? She married Kevin Federline. Between the pregnant baby mama he had on the side when he first met Brit and the way-too-hasty of a courtship, this couple was fated to have a trashy wedding. The bride and groom parties each had their own Juicy Couture sweatsuits custom made for them. Sure, they were as cool at the time as those one piece bachelorette party swimsuits from Private Party are now, but trust us, it gets worse.</p>\n<p>Britney\u2019s bridal squad\u2019s suits were baby pink and encrusted with diamonds, while she donned an all-white tube top tracksuit that looked as low-rent as her wedding dress. Kevin and his party wore Juicy Couture sweatsuits as well, but they had \u201cPIMP\u201d embroidered on the back. Except for Kevin\u2019s dad\u2014he had \u201cPIMP DADDY\u201d on his. Oh, and the worst part? This was a surprise wedding. Britney and Kevin invited heir guests under the guise that they were attending an engagement party and the invitees were probably like, \u201coh, we\u2019ll go because we know they\u2019ll never make it to the altar.\u201d But it turns out they were actually AT the wedding itself, so they were probably so caught off guard no one could scream \u201cI object!\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019m being overdramatic (okay, I\u2019m always being overdramatic), but Britney\u2019s first wedding at Las Vegas\u2019 Little White Chapel is looking like some Nicholas Sparks-level sh*t compared to this shindig.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-full wp-image-37177 src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21154729/giphy33.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\"/></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>2. <a href=\"http://www.bravotv.com/vanderpump-rules/photos/scheana-and-shays-wedding-album/item/10631491\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scheana Marie and Mike Shay</a></h2>\n<p>How can we forget when Scheana wanted to put the \u201cass\u201d in class and insisted on having a wedding dress that she could twerk in for her first dance with her husband? What an iconic cultural touchstone. Scheana is also the only girl I can think of to ever have a crop top wedding dress.</p>\n<p>Aside from the crop top dress, Scheana\u2019s wedding has something else in common with your trashy cousin\u2019s wedding: someone got punched in the face. And of course, that douchebag was James Kennedy. James Kennedy getting punched in the face isn\u2019t even the trashiest part. The trashiest part was Scheana adorning her apartment with giant blown-up photographs of her and Shay from the wedding. Pretty sure she still has the ones of just her hung up in her apartment.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-full wp-image-37179 src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21155324/scheana.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"/></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>3. <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/photos/3755/kim-kardashian-s-wedding-album\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries</a></h2>\n<p>Okay, rumors swirling that you got married for fame alone makes for a trashy wedding. But for the record, I strongly disagree with this allegation. If a guy who is 6\u20199\u201d proposes to you, you 10000000% say yes. This hot mess of a marriage ended quicker than my almond milk expires. The only good thing about this wedding is that it put <a href=\"https://betches.com/book-series-to-binge-while-you-wait-for-game-of-thrones-to-come-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ten million dollars</a> back into the economy. And people think Kim\u2019s selfish?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-full wp-image-37181 src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21155831/giphy-227.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"162\"/></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>4. <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/event/pamela-anderson-and-kid-rock-marry-in-saint-tropez-71532756#/sainttropez-france-canadian-actress-pamela-anderson-shares-a-drink-picture-id71538375\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pamela Anderson\u2019s Weddings</a></h2>\n<p>Fun fact: Pamela Anderson got married in a bikini. Twice. I can\u2019t even get my picture taken in a bikini without doing a kegstand of FitTea and crying to detox myself of any water weight before I FaceTune the sh*t out of my stomach, so you go girl! Pamela first married Tommy Lee\u202696 hours after they met. Did we mention he met her when he was high on ecstasy? But who are we to judge? I\u2019ll probably meet my future husband when I\u2019m blacked out from vodka sodas. Anyway. Pam and Tommy got married in Cancun. That\u2019s like, Cabo\u2019s deadbeat cousin, so that in and of itself is a warning sign. That marriage *shockingly* ended after two children, a leaked sex tape, a prison sentence, and a shared diagnosis of Hepatitis.</p>\n<p>So Pamela went on to marry Kid Rock. I know what you\u2019re thinking: who would find Kid Rock attractive? Not even female Kid Rock megafans find Kid Rock sexually attractive, probably because the only men they find attractive are their first cousins. But I digress. Pam and Kid Rock got married on a yacht in Saint Tropez ,which is classy until you factor in that A) Pam was wearing a bikini, B) Kid Rock was wearing a white V-neck and a Detroit Tigers baseball hat, and C) Kid Rock\u2019s website said they were \u201cregistered at Wal-Mart.\u201d I honestly need to bleach my brain after reading this.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-full wp-image-37183 src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21160333/giphy-320.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" height=\"336\"/></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>5. <a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/2018022446565/emily-tatajkowski-marries-sebastian-bear-mcclard-suprise-new-york-wedding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emily Ratajkowski and Sebastian Bear-McClard</a></h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background:;\" border: border-radius: box-shadow: rgba margin: max-width: min-width: padding: width: calc data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfl6Qz0F78b/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding:;\">\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: row align-items: center>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: margin-right: width:></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: column flex-grow: justify-content: center>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: margin-bottom: width:></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: width:></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding:;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" block height: margin: auto width:></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top:;\">\n<div style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height:>View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding:;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: row margin-bottom: align-items: center>\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: height: width: transform: translatex translatey></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" height: transform: rotate translatex translatey width: flex-grow: margin-right: margin-left:></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: height: width: transform: translatex translatey></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:;\">\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: width:></div>\n<div style=\"width:;\" height: border-top: solid transparent border-left: border-bottom: transform: translatex translatey rotate></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:;\" auto>\n<div style=\"width:;\" border-top: solid border-right: transparent transform: translatey></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" flex-grow: height: width: transform: translatey></div>\n<div style=\"width:;\" height: border-top: solid border-left: transparent transform: translatey translatex></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin:;\" padding:><a style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height: text-decoration: none word-wrap: break-word href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfl6Qz0F78b/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\ud83d\udcab</a></p>\n<p style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: line-height: margin-bottom: margin-top: overflow: hidden padding: text-align: center text-overflow: ellipsis white-space: nowrap>A post shared by <a style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height: href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emrata/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Emily Ratajkowski</a> (@emrata) on <time style=\"font-family:;\" arial font-size: line-height: datetime=\"2018-02-24T20:10:59+00:00\">Feb 24, 2018 at 12:10pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async defer src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script><br/> Instagram famous Emily married trust fund dumpster baby Sebastian Bear McClean in what has to be the most underwhelming wedding of all time. Legit, if you scroll through these people\u2019s respective Instagram\u2019s, they both look aggressively bored. Emily wore a mustard suit from Zara to their nuptials, held at a New York courthouse after a quickie engagement. Like, if you have that in common with Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, your marriage is already doomed.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>6. <a href=\"https://www.brides.com/story/victoria-and-david-beckham-anniversary-wedding-photos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David and Victoria Beckham</a></h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background:;\" border: border-radius: box-shadow: rgba margin: max-width: min-width: padding: width: calc data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/qBw0LZFiAX/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding:;\">\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: row align-items: center>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: margin-right: width:></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: column flex-grow: justify-content: center>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: margin-bottom: width:></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: width:></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding:;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" block height: margin: auto width:></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top:;\">\n<div style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height:>View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding:;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: row margin-bottom: align-items: center>\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: height: width: transform: translatex translatey></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" height: transform: rotate translatex translatey width: flex-grow: margin-right: margin-left:></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: height: width: transform: translatex translatey></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:;\">\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: width:></div>\n<div style=\"width:;\" height: border-top: solid transparent border-left: border-bottom: transform: translatex translatey rotate></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:;\" auto>\n<div style=\"width:;\" border-top: solid border-right: transparent transform: translatey></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" flex-grow: height: width: transform: translatey></div>\n<div style=\"width:;\" height: border-top: solid border-left: transparent transform: translatey translatex></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin:;\" padding:><a style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height: text-decoration: none word-wrap: break-word href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/qBw0LZFiAX/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thank you for your beautiful messages.Its such a special day for us both.Your love and support means so much x vb\ud83d\udc9c</a></p>\n<p style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: line-height: margin-bottom: margin-top: overflow: hidden padding: text-align: center text-overflow: ellipsis white-space: nowrap>A post shared by <a style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height: href=\"https://www.instagram.com/victoriabeckham/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Victoria Beckham</a> (@victoriabeckham) on <time style=\"font-family:;\" arial font-size: line-height: datetime=\"2014-07-04T11:31:22+00:00\">Jul 4, 2014 at 4:31am PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async defer src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script><br/> You\u2019ve seen her fashion sense. You\u2019ve seen his bulge in underwear ads. So it hurts my cold, dead heart to say that these two had a trashy wedding. They wore coordinating outfits. Twice. First, Victoria wore a white Vera Wang gown, as per celebutante tradition, but then David was like \u201chey! I\u2019ll wear an all-white tux and we\u2019ll be twinsies!\u201d (I paraphrase.) David, a word to the wise: when you marry a member of one of the most iconic girl pop groups of all time, try not to look like a Backstreet Boy reject.</p>\n<p>It gets worse. During their send-off, they wore coordinating all-purple outfits. Just because you two probably share hair and makeup products, doesn\u2019t mean you should share the same outfits. That Laura Ashley sh*t wasn\u2019t cute when our moms forced us to do it for our Christmas card pics, so why would it work for your wedding?</p>\n<p>Oh, and they cut their wedding cake with a sword. A SWORD. And this woman is supposed to be a tastemaker in the fashion world.

You\u2019ve seen his bulge in underwear ads. So it hurts my cold, dead heart to say that these two had a trashy wedding. They wore coordinating outfits. Twice. First, Victoria wore a white Vera Wang gown, as per celebutante tradition, but then David was like \u201chey! I\u2019ll wear an all-white tux and we\u2019ll be twinsies!\u201d (I paraphrase.) David, a word to the wise: when you marry a member of one of the most iconic girl pop groups of all time, try not to look like a Backstreet Boy reject.</p>\n<p>It gets worse. During their send-off, they wore coordinating all-purple outfits. Just because you two probably share hair and makeup products, doesn\u2019t mean you should share the same outfits.

I get to sit on the sidelines, laughing at how f*cked those marriages are from the get-go. Is that \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cemotionally intelligent\u201d\u2019of me? No, but you\u2019re not my shrink and she and I have a whole boatload of other issues of mine to tackle before we address why I shame people for their doomed relationships. Anyway, here are some of the trashiest celebrity weddings of all time. And fun fact: more than half of these weddings also have leaked sex tapes. Not really material to the article, I just thought it was an interesting correlation.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>1. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/hunterschwarz/the-definitive-britney-spears-weddings-photo-alb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Britney Spears and Kevin Federline</a></h2>\n<p>Britney famously got married in Las Vegas to some high school friend of hers, and she somehow managed to get trashier than that at her next wedding. How, you wonder? She married Kevin Federline. Between the pregnant baby mama he had on the side when he first met Brit and the way-too-hasty of a courtship, this couple was fated to have a trashy wedding. The bride and groom parties each had their own Juicy Couture sweatsuits custom made for them. Sure, they were as cool at the time as those one piece bachelorette party swimsuits from Private Party are now, but trust us, it gets worse.</p>\n<p>Britney\u2019s bridal squad\u2019s suits were baby pink and encrusted with diamonds, while she donned an all-white tube top tracksuit that looked as low-rent as her wedding dress. Kevin and his party wore Juicy Couture sweatsuits as well, but they had \u201cPIMP\u201d embroidered on the back. Except for Kevin\u2019s dad\u2014he had \u201cPIMP DADDY\u201d on his. Oh, and the worst part? This was a surprise wedding. Britney and Kevin invited heir guests under the guise that they were attending an engagement party and the invitees were probably like, \u201coh, we\u2019ll go because we know they\u2019ll never make it to the altar.\u201d But it turns out they were actually AT the wedding itself, so they were probably so caught off guard no one could scream \u201cI object!\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019m being overdramatic (okay, I\u2019m always being overdramatic), but Britney\u2019s first wedding at Las Vegas\u2019 Little White Chapel is looking like some Nicholas Sparks-level sh*t compared to this shindig.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-full wp-image-37177 src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21154729/giphy33.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\"></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>2. <a href=\"http://www.bravotv.com/vanderpump-rules/photos/scheana-and-shays-wedding-album/item/10631491\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scheana Marie and Mike Shay</a></h2>\n<p>How can we forget when Scheana wanted to put the \u201cass\u201d in class and insisted on having a wedding dress that she could twerk in for her first dance with her husband? What an iconic cultural touchstone. Scheana is also the only girl I can think of to ever have a crop top wedding dress.</p>\n<p>Aside from the crop top dress, Scheana\u2019s wedding has something else in common with your trashy cousin\u2019s wedding: someone got punched in the face. And of course, that douchebag was James Kennedy. James Kennedy getting punched in the face isn\u2019t even the trashiest part. The trashiest part was Scheana adorning her apartment with giant blown-up photographs of her and Shay from the wedding. Pretty sure she still has the ones of just her hung up in her apartment.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-full wp-image-37179 src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21155324/scheana.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>3. <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/photos/3755/kim-kardashian-s-wedding-album\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries</a></h2>\n<p>Okay, rumors swirling that you got married for fame alone makes for a trashy wedding. But for the record, I strongly disagree with this allegation. If a guy who is 6\u20199\u201d proposes to you, you 10000000% say yes. This hot mess of a marriage ended quicker than my almond milk expires. The only good thing about this wedding is that it put <a href=\"https://betches.com/book-series-to-binge-while-you-wait-for-game-of-thrones-to-come-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ten million dollars</a> back into the economy. And people think Kim\u2019s selfish?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-full wp-image-37181 src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21155831/giphy-227.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"162\"></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>4. <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/event/pamela-anderson-and-kid-rock-marry-in-saint-tropez-71532756#/sainttropez-france-canadian-actress-pamela-anderson-shares-a-drink-picture-id71538375\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pamela Anderson\u2019s Weddings</a></h2>\n<p>Fun fact: Pamela Anderson got married in a bikini. Twice. I can\u2019t even get my picture taken in a bikini without doing a kegstand of FitTea and crying to detox myself of any water weight before I FaceTune the sh*t out of my stomach, so you go girl! Pamela first married Tommy Lee\u202696 hours after they met. Did we mention he met her when he was high on ecstasy? But who are we to judge? I\u2019ll probably meet my future husband when I\u2019m blacked out from vodka sodas. Anyway. Pam and Tommy got married in Cancun. That\u2019s like, Cabo\u2019s deadbeat cousin, so that in and of itself is a warning sign. That marriage *shockingly* ended after two children, a leaked sex tape, a prison sentence, and a shared diagnosis of Hepatitis.</p>\n<p>So Pamela went on to marry Kid Rock. I know what you\u2019re thinking: who would find Kid Rock attractive? Not even female Kid Rock megafans find Kid Rock sexually attractive, probably because the only men they find attractive are their first cousins. But I digress. Pam and Kid Rock got married on a yacht in Saint Tropez ,which is classy until you factor in that A) Pam was wearing a bikini, B) Kid Rock was wearing a white V-neck and a Detroit Tigers baseball hat, and C) Kid Rock\u2019s website said they were \u201cregistered at Wal-Mart.\u201d I honestly need to bleach my brain after reading this.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-full wp-image-37183 src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21160333/giphy-320.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" height=\"336\"></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:;\" center>5. <a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/2018022446565/emily-tatajkowski-marries-sebastian-bear-mcclard-suprise-new-york-wedding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emily Ratajkowski and Sebastian Bear-McClard</a></h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background:;\" border: border-radius: box-shadow: rgba margin: max-width: min-width: padding: width: calc data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfl6Qz0F78b/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding:;\">\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: row align-items: center>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: margin-right: width:></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: column flex-grow: justify-content: center>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: margin-bottom: width:></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: width:></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding:;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" block height: margin: auto width:></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top:;\">\n<div style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height:>View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding:;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display:;\" flex flex-direction: row margin-bottom: align-items: center>\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: height: width: transform: translatex translatey></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" height: transform: rotate translatex translatey width: flex-grow: margin-right: margin-left:></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: height: width: transform: translatex translatey></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:;\">\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" border-radius: flex-grow: height: width:></div>\n<div style=\"width:;\" height: border-top: solid transparent border-left: border-bottom: transform: translatex translatey rotate></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:;\" auto>\n<div style=\"width:;\" border-top: solid border-right: transparent transform: translatey></div>\n<div style=\"background-color:;\" flex-grow: height: width: transform: translatey></div>\n<div style=\"width:;\" height: border-top: solid border-left: transparent transform: translatey translatex></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin:;\" padding:><a style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height: text-decoration: none word-wrap: break-word href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfl6Qz0F78b/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\ud83d\udcab</a></p>\n<p style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: line-height: margin-bottom: margin-top: overflow: hidden padding: text-align: center text-overflow: ellipsis white-space: nowrap>A post shared by <a style=\"color:;\" font-family: arial font-size: font-style: normal font-weight: line-height: href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emrata/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Emily Ratajkowski</a> (@emrata) on <time style=\"font-family:;\" arial font-size: line-height: datetime=\"2018-02-24T20:10:59+00:00\">Feb 24, 2018 at 12:10pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async defer src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script><br> Instagram famous Emily married trust fund dumpster baby Sebastian Bear McClean in what has to be the most underwhelming wedding of all time.

                "content": "<p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I love trashy weddings. They make me feel so much better about being single. I get to sit on the sidelines, laughing at how f*cked those marriages are from the get-go. Is that &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; and &ldquo;emotionally intelligent&rdquo;&rsquo;of me? No, but you&rsquo;re not my shrink and she and I have a whole boatload of other issues of mine to tackle before we address why I shame people for their doomed relationships. Anyway, here are some of the trashiest celebrity weddings of all time. And fun fact: more than half of these weddings also have leaked sex tapes. Not really material to the article, I just thought it was an interesting correlation.</p>\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/hunterschwarz/the-definitive-britney-spears-weddings-photo-alb\" target=\"_blank\">Britney Spears and Kevin Federline</a></h2>\n<p>Britney famously got married in Las Vegas to some high school friend of hers, and she somehow managed to get trashier than that at her next wedding. How, you wonder? She married Kevin Federline. Between the pregnant baby mama he had on the side when he first met Brit and the way-too-hasty of a courtship, this couple was fated to have a trashy wedding. The bride and groom parties each had their own Juicy Couture sweatsuits custom made for them. Sure, they were as cool at the time as those one piece bachelorette party swimsuits from Private Party are now, but trust us, it gets worse.</p>\n<p>Britney&rsquo;s bridal squad&rsquo;s suits were baby pink and encrusted with diamonds, while she donned an all-white tube top tracksuit that looked as low-rent as her wedding dress. Kevin and his party wore Juicy Couture sweatsuits as well, but they had &ldquo;PIMP&rdquo; embroidered on the back. Except for Kevin&rsquo;s dad&mdash;he had &ldquo;PIMP DADDY&rdquo; on his. Oh, and the worst part? This was a surprise wedding. Britney and Kevin invited heir guests under the guise that they were attending an engagement party and the invitees were probably like, &ldquo;oh, we&rsquo;ll go because we know they&rsquo;ll never make it to the altar.&rdquo; But it turns out they were actually AT the wedding itself, so they were probably so caught off guard no one could scream &ldquo;I object!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being overdramatic (okay, I&rsquo;m always being overdramatic), but Britney&rsquo;s first wedding at Las Vegas&rsquo; Little White Chapel is looking like some Nicholas Sparks-level sh*t compared to this shindig.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21154729/giphy33.gif\">External image</div></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.bravotv.com/vanderpump-rules/photos/scheana-and-shays-wedding-album/item/10631491\" target=\"_blank\">Scheana Marie and Mike Shay</a></h2>\n<p>How can we forget when Scheana wanted to put the &ldquo;ass&rdquo; in class and insisted on having a wedding dress that she could twerk in for her first dance with her husband? What an iconic cultural touchstone. Scheana is also the only girl I can think of to ever have a crop top wedding dress.</p>\n<p>Aside from the crop top dress, Scheana&rsquo;s wedding has something else in common with your trashy cousin&rsquo;s wedding: someone got punched in the face. And of course, that douchebag was James Kennedy. James Kennedy getting punched in the face isn&rsquo;t even the trashiest part. The trashiest part was Scheana adorning her apartment with giant blown-up photographs of her and Shay from the wedding. Pretty sure she still has the ones of just her hung up in her apartment.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21155324/scheana.gif\">External image</div></p>\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/photos/3755/kim-kardashian-s-wedding-album\" target=\"_blank\">Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries</a></h2>\n<p>Okay, rumors swirling that you got married for fame alone makes for a trashy wedding. But for the record, I strongly disagree with this allegation. If a guy who is 6&rsquo;9&rdquo; proposes to you, you 10000000% say yes. This hot mess of a marriage ended quicker than my almond milk expires. The only good thing about this wedding is that it put <a href=\"https://betches.com/book-series-to-binge-while-you-wait-for-game-of-thrones-to-come-back/\" target=\"_blank\">ten million dollars</a> back into the economy. And people think Kim&rsquo;s selfish?</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21155831/giphy-227.gif\">External image</div></p>\n<h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/event/pamela-anderson-and-kid-rock-marry-in-saint-tropez-71532756#/sainttropez-france-canadian-actress-pamela-anderson-shares-a-drink-picture-id71538375\" target=\"_blank\">Pamela Anderson&rsquo;s Weddings</a></h2>\n<p>Fun fact: Pamela Anderson got married in a bikini. Twice. I can&rsquo;t even get my picture taken in a bikini without doing a kegstand of FitTea and crying to detox myself of any water weight before I FaceTune the sh*t out of my stomach, so you go girl! Pamela first married Tommy Lee&hellip;96 hours after they met. Did we mention he met her when he was high on ecstasy? But who are we to judge? I&rsquo;ll probably meet my future husband when I&rsquo;m blacked out from vodka sodas. Anyway. Pam and Tommy got married in Cancun. That&rsquo;s like, Cabo&rsquo;s deadbeat cousin, so that in and of itself is a warning sign. That marriage *shockingly* ended after two children, a leaked sex tape, a prison sentence, and a shared diagnosis of Hepatitis.</p>\n<p>So Pamela went on to marry Kid Rock. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: who would find Kid Rock attractive? Not even female Kid Rock megafans find Kid Rock sexually attractive, probably because the only men they find attractive are their first cousins. But I digress. Pam and Kid Rock got married on a yacht in Saint Tropez ,which is classy until you factor in that A) Pam was wearing a bikini, B) Kid Rock was wearing a white V-neck and a Detroit Tigers baseball hat, and C) Kid Rock&rsquo;s website said they were &ldquo;registered at Wal-Mart.&rdquo; I honestly need to bleach my brain after reading this.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/betches/app/uploads/2018/09/21160333/giphy-320.gif\">External image</div></p>\n<h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/2018022446565/emily-tatajkowski-marries-sebastian-bear-mcclard-suprise-new-york-wedding/\" target=\"_blank\">Emily Ratajkowski and Sebastian Bear-McClard</a></h2>\n<blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfl6Qz0F78b/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" target=\"_blank\">&#128171;</a></p>\n<p>A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emrata/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading\" target=\"_blank\"> Emily Ratajkowski</a> (@emrata) on Feb 24, 2018 at 12:10pm PST</p>\n\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p><br /> Instagram famous Emily married trust fund dumpster baby Sebastian Bear McClean in what has to be the most underwhelming wedding of all time.
