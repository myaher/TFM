You\u2019re a lord now. You have responsibilities!\u201d Jon argued, his friend\u2019s attitude threatening his temper to rise. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t want to go anymore than you do. Feasts were never my favorite pastime growing up, but Sansa is throwing a feast in honor of defeating the army of the dead and Cersei. We both have no choice.\u201d </p><p>\tAs irritated as he was, Gendry nodded in understanding. He knew that getting legitimized would come with just as many consequences as it did perks, but he was naive to think he could escape the feasts. Jon spoke again, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll finally find a wife. You know that we need to start rebuilding the world we took part in devastating in the great war.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, so you\u2019re forcing me to attend this feast to help me find a pretty little bride?\u201d Gendry accused bitterly, \u201cyou and I both know I\u2019m not going to find anyone there. The only chance I had at love left on a ship to Braavos as soon as the names on her list were crossed off.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI never said you need to find love,\u201d Jon said unabashed. \u201cYou could find friendship instead. Maybe it would be like my fath- my uncle and lady Stark? You could grow to love one another.\u201d</p><p>\tGendry shook his head and raked his fingers through his growing hair. It was finally back to the length it was when he and Arya was traveling on the King\u2019s Road. Even thinking of her hurt. They had rekindled their friendship amidst the loss they suffered on the battlefield, their unspeakable bond forged once more. He had not been surprised when Arya revealed that she would once again be sailing to Braavos. He had half a mind to jump on the ship with her, unwilling to let her go, but he knew she needed to do this by herself. So he stood on the dock and waved her goodbye until she faded into the clouds across the sea. He remembered biting back tears that day, unwilling to let anyone other than her see his weakness. He had gotten the news of his legitimization days after she left and the ceremony was hard to bear without her by his side, but he did so just the same. It has been over a year since he\u2019d last seen her face. Things had started to settle in the realm, and so came the great feast that Queen Sansa was throwing. Everyone was surprised to hear the news of Jon\u2019s true parentage, Queen Daenerys especially. But she chose to fight by him just the same knowing that Jon held no interest in ruling the Seven Kingdoms, only the North. The universe had other plans though. It was nearing the end of the fight, everyone was too tired to keep going and the Dragon Queen noticed. She had mounted Drogon and flew directly at the Night King. Before anyone could blink dragon glass was raining from the sky as fire met ice in the sky above them. The spears that rained from the sky helped erase the army of the dead just enough for them to get a fighting chance. The sound that the ice dragon made when Rhaegal attacked him giving Drogon the upper hand was deafening. The two dragons were drove to the ground, both of them landing on the sharp spear of obsidian that stuck up from the ground. With the Night Kind vulnerable underneath the body of Viserion Jon approached him, Longclaw held in his hand tightly. The King in the North howled like the wolf he was when he brought his sword down, separating the Night King\u2019s head from the rest of his body. Daenerys wasted no time in flying down from above and destroying the ice king with one powerful word. </p><p>\tWith the great war fought and won the men and women relaxed. Each ecstatic with the unbelievable win, but that was when she struck. Cersei Lannister rode out with the Golden Company, devastating half their forces easily. It took one quick ride for Daenerys to wipe out half of the mercenaries and then half of that half, but on her third trip back a hair raising scream stretched across the battlefield. Every man and woman watched as a small body fell from the sky with a arrow protruding clearly from her chest. Drogon screeched from above and as he was distracted a large bolt flew from the ground, impaling itself in the creature&rsquo;s skull, and just like that dragons were once again wiped from the world. The fighting seemed to halt then, everyone in disbelief that the all-powerful Dragon Queen was dead. The Golden Company struct hard and with every last ounce of strength they had the combined armies fought for their lost queen. There would be time for mourning once the fighting was finished. Quickly the army bought from Tyrell gold had fallen and no one other than Arya Stark stood above Cersei Lannister\u2019s lifeless body holding her head up for everyone to see while a blood curdling scream echoed from her lips across the field of the fallen. They had lost so many people that day, but he hadn\u2019t lost her. Yet, he let her slip away from him once more when they returned to Winterfell. The castle was barely standing, many parts of it in ruin from the war. He was impressed that together they were able to restore it within the year. The ancestral seat of the Starks standing proud once more. Lady Sansa had made sure to wait for everything to be restored before she called everyone to feast at Winterfell once more, thinking it the best place for everyone who fought on the battlefield to be honored. Winter had come and gone with the Night King and they were in the midst of spring. The realm was starting to recuperate and Jon was ruling in King\u2019s Landing. He had married Talla Tarly, Samwell\u2019s sister and they were expecting their first-born child within a few moons. Samwell was relieved of his duties to the Night\u2019s Watch to help rebuild house Tarly. He had married Gilly and they too were expecting a babe, no one was surprised when Jon declared them Protector of the Reach. As for the North, Sansa was ruling alongside her husband Sandor Clegane. Everyone was shocked to see them married, but Jon had promised his cousin that she would choose who she married. As for her first husband, Tyrion Lannister he was named Hand of the King and planned to marry one of Walder Frey\u2019s daughters and rule over their first born would rule over Casterly Rock, the seat Tyrion had been given by Jon, and their second born would rule over the Twins but take the name Frey. His brother Jaime had been pardoned and was to marry Brienne when they both fully recovered from the war and they would reside in Tarth. He was the only person from a remaining great house to not get married aside from Arya, but everyone knew she would not marry unless she chose them herself. Hells, Jon had even legitimized Teyne Sand who managed to survive Cersei\u2019s attempted poisoning. She had lost her ability to speak the poison ruining her vocal chords, but she was alive and married Bron which made tonight\u2019s festivities even worse. It meant that every unmarried woman at the feast would be vying for his hand, putting even more attention on him. Still, he dressed in Baratheon robes, ones that no longer felt foreign to him, and ready himself for the feast. He was dressed in Baratheon yellow and black, the stag embroidered into his chest giving him the strength he needed to walk out the door of his chambers and across the yard. His pulse throbbed as he approached the great hall, he had no time to turn back when the guards opened the doors. Everyone\u2019s eyes landed on him making him instantly even more uncomfortable. He moved to sit at one of the tables off to the side when a serving girl stopped him. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re to sit at the head table my lord.\u201d She said just loud enough for him to hear. He groaned internally and turned around so he was facing the head table. Jon was watching him with a teasing grin spread across his face. Begrudgingly, Gendry approached the table and sat next to Talla, Jon\u2019s wife. </p><p>\t\u201cWe thought you weren\u2019t going to show up.\u201d The Hound said from across the table as he put down his ale. Sansa looked at him and smiled. Jon interrupted him before he could speak again.</p><p>\t\u201cTonight isn\u2019t going to be one you want to miss.\u201d Everyone at the head table chuckled to themselves making Gendry shuffle in his chair awkwardly. There was an empty seat next to him which he forced himself to ignore. He figured they would try and set him up with Meera Reed tonight, but as she entered the room and sat herself at a table near the front of the room he became more confused. Everyone who was invited to Winterfell was sitting inside the great hall. Everyone was chatting happily when the doors opened once more. He saw the hem of a gown before a large man stood blocking his view. When he sat down the doors were closed and no one was in sight, not until she moved to stand in the center aisle walking directly for the head table. Gendry\u2019s heart stopped beating at the sight of her. She was wearing a grey gown with a bodice that fit her just right. He stood abruptly as she reached the front of the table. </p><p>\t\u201cArya?\u201d He whispered his eyes watering the slightest bit. She smiled up at him and moved to stand directly in front of him. He couldn\u2019t stand idly any longer, so he took the remaining step to pick her up and wrap her in a tight embrace. His face was buried in her neck and her loose hair tickled the sides if his face that his small beard did not cover. </p><p>\t\u201cLord Baratheon, it\u2019s a pleasure to see you.\u201d She said coyly when he set her back on the ground. They both moved to sit at the table where Arya had her reunion with her remaining family members. The night went on after that. Arya told everyone of her adventures in Braavos and how she spent time sailing across the seas. Unlike the rest of the members at the table, Gendry was waiting for her to tell them all that she would be leaving again, but she did not get the chance as the tables were moved and the dancing commenced. Everyone at the head table stood to lead their significant others to the dance floor. Gendry looked at her and scratched the back of his neck before asking if she\u2019d like to dance. He knew it was a stupid question as soon as it left his mouth, but she stood and grabbed his hand anyway, pulling him gently to the side of the room to dance. He rested one of his hands on her hip and the other held her hand in his own. They danced in silence for a moment before she began to speak. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that you still haven\u2019t taken a wife. Jon says there have been plenty of options, but you\u2019ve refused them all. You need to produce an heir for Storms End one day Gendry. Why haven\u2019t you wed yet?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNone of the other women compare to the one I want.\u201d Gendry said calmly, looking her in the eye. \u201cIt makes it difficult to settle when she is always in the back of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell why don\u2019t you tell her stupid?\u201d She quipped gently, and it slipped from his mouth before he could stop himself.</p><p>\t\u201cI am.\u201d Arya stilled and looked at him closely then. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t have me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSays who?\u201d It was Gendry\u2019s turn to pause then. His hand gripped her hip a little tighter in that moment. \u201cThere was a time when I refused to marry, but I have long passed those days Gendry. I needed to return to Braavos and make sure that what I wanted was here and it is. I\u2019m not going anywhere, not unless you ask.\u201d</p><p>\tHe looked at her and moved so he held both of her hands in his. Taking a deep breath he looked up into her grey eyes. \u201cArya Stark, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes,\u201d she squeezed his hand and spoke again, this time much quieter. \u201cI can and will be your family Gendry Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\tHe smiled at her then and saw the look returned on her own face. Bending down he pressed a kiss to her forehead, \u201cI\u2019ll finally have a family of my own.\u201d</p>",

You\u2019re a lord now. You have responsibilities!\u201d Jon argued, his friend\u2019s attitude threatening his temper to rise. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t want to go anymore than you do. Feasts were never my favorite pastime growing up, but Sansa is throwing a feast in honor of defeating the army of the dead and Cersei. We both have no choice.\u201d </p><p>\tAs irritated as he was, Gendry nodded in understanding. He knew that getting legitimized would come with just as many consequences as it did perks, but he was naive to think he could escape the feasts. Jon spoke again, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll finally find a wife. You know that we need to start rebuilding the world we took part in devastating in the great war.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, so you\u2019re forcing me to attend this feast to help me find a pretty little bride?\u201d Gendry accused bitterly, \u201cyou and I both know I\u2019m not going to find anyone there. The only chance I had at love left on a ship to Braavos as soon as the names on her list were crossed off.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI never said you need to find love,\u201d Jon said unabashed. \u201cYou could find friendship instead. Maybe it would be like my fath- my uncle and lady Stark? You could grow to love one another.\u201d</p><p>\tGendry shook his head and raked his fingers through his growing hair. It was finally back to the length it was when he and Arya was traveling on the King\u2019s Road. Even thinking of her hurt. They had rekindled their friendship amidst the loss they suffered on the battlefield, their unspeakable bond forged once more. He had not been surprised when Arya revealed that she would once again be sailing to Braavos. He had half a mind to jump on the ship with her, unwilling to let her go, but he knew she needed to do this by herself. So he stood on the dock and waved her goodbye until she faded into the clouds across the sea. He remembered biting back tears that day, unwilling to let anyone other than her see his weakness. He had gotten the news of his legitimization days after she left and the ceremony was hard to bear without her by his side, but he did so just the same. It has been over a year since he\u2019d last seen her face. Things had started to settle in the realm, and so came the great feast that Queen Sansa was throwing. Everyone was surprised to hear the news of Jon\u2019s true parentage, Queen Daenerys especially. But she chose to fight by him just the same knowing that Jon held no interest in ruling the Seven Kingdoms, only the North. The universe had other plans though. It was nearing the end of the fight, everyone was too tired to keep going and the Dragon Queen noticed. She had mounted Drogon and flew directly at the Night King. Before anyone could blink dragon glass was raining from the sky as fire met ice in the sky above them. The spears that rained from the sky helped erase the army of the dead just enough for them to get a fighting chance. The sound that the ice dragon made when Rhaegal attacked him giving Drogon the upper hand was deafening. The two dragons were drove to the ground, both of them landing on the sharp spear of obsidian that stuck up from the ground. With the Night Kind vulnerable underneath the body of Viserion Jon approached him, Longclaw held in his hand tightly. The King in the North howled like the wolf he was when he brought his sword down, separating the Night King\u2019s head from the rest of his body. Daenerys wasted no time in flying down from above and destroying the ice king with one powerful word. </p><p>\tWith the great war fought and won the men and women relaxed. Each ecstatic with the unbelievable win, but that was when she struck. Cersei Lannister rode out with the Golden Company, devastating half their forces easily. It took one quick ride for Daenerys to wipe out half of the mercenaries and then half of that half, but on her third trip back a hair raising scream stretched across the battlefield. Every man and woman watched as a small body fell from the sky with a arrow protruding clearly from her chest. Drogon screeched from above and as he was distracted a large bolt flew from the ground, impaling itself in the creature\u2019s skull, and just like that dragons were once again wiped from the world. The fighting seemed to halt then, everyone in disbelief that the all-powerful Dragon Queen was dead. The Golden Company struct hard and with every last ounce of strength they had the combined armies fought for their lost queen. There would be time for mourning once the fighting was finished. Quickly the army bought from Tyrell gold had fallen and no one other than Arya Stark stood above Cersei Lannister\u2019s lifeless body holding her head up for everyone to see while a blood curdling scream echoed from her lips across the field of the fallen. They had lost so many people that day, but he hadn\u2019t lost her. Yet, he let her slip away from him once more when they returned to Winterfell. The castle was barely standing, many parts of it in ruin from the war. He was impressed that together they were able to restore it within the year.

Lady Sansa had made sure to wait for everything to be restored before she called everyone to feast at Winterfell once more, thinking it the best place for everyone who fought on the battlefield to be honored. Winter had come and gone with the Night King and they were in the midst of spring. The realm was starting to recuperate and Jon was ruling in King\u2019s Landing. He had married Talla Tarly, Samwell\u2019s sister and they were expecting their first-born child within a few moons. Samwell was relieved of his duties to the Night\u2019s Watch to help rebuild house Tarly. He had married Gilly and they too were expecting a babe, no one was surprised when Jon declared them Protector of the Reach. As for the North, Sansa was ruling alongside her husband Sandor Clegane. Everyone was shocked to see them married, but Jon had promised his cousin that she would choose who she married. As for her first husband, Tyrion Lannister he was named Hand of the King and planned to marry one of Walder Frey\u2019s daughters and rule over their first born would rule over Casterly Rock, the seat Tyrion had been given by Jon, and their second born would rule over the Twins but take the name Frey. His brother Jaime had been pardoned and was to marry Brienne when they both fully recovered from the war and they would reside in Tarth. He was the only person from a remaining great house to not get married aside from Arya, but everyone knew she would not marry unless she chose them herself. Hells, Jon had even legitimized Teyne Sand who managed to survive Cersei\u2019s attempted poisoning. She had lost her ability to speak the poison ruining her vocal chords, but she was alive and married Bron which made tonight\u2019s festivities even worse. It meant that every unmarried woman at the feast would be vying for his hand, putting even more attention on him. Still, he dressed in Baratheon robes, ones that no longer felt foreign to him, and ready himself for the feast. He was dressed in Baratheon yellow and black, the stag embroidered into his chest giving him the strength he needed to walk out the door of his chambers and across the yard. His pulse throbbed as he approached the great hall, he had no time to turn back when the guards opened the doors. Everyone\u2019s eyes landed on him making him instantly even more uncomfortable. He moved to sit at one of the tables off to the side when a serving girl stopped him. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re to sit at the head table my lord.\u201d She said just loud enough for him to hear. He groaned internally and turned around so he was facing the head table. Jon was watching him with a teasing grin spread across his face. Begrudgingly, Gendry approached the table and sat next to Talla, Jon\u2019s wife. </p><p>\t\u201cWe thought you weren\u2019t going to show up.\u201d The Hound said from across the table as he put down his ale. Sansa looked at him and smiled. Jon interrupted him before he could speak again.</p><p>\t\u201cTonight isn\u2019t going to be one you want to miss.\u201d Everyone at the head table chuckled to themselves making Gendry shuffle in his chair awkwardly. There was an empty seat next to him which he forced himself to ignore. He figured they would try and set him up with Meera Reed tonight, but as she entered the room and sat herself at a table near the front of the room he became more confused. Everyone who was invited to Winterfell was sitting inside the great hall. Everyone was chatting happily when the doors opened once more. He saw the hem of a gown before a large man stood blocking his view. When he sat down the doors were closed and no one was in sight, not until she moved to stand in the center aisle walking directly for the head table. Gendry\u2019s heart stopped beating at the sight of her. She was wearing a grey gown with a bodice that fit her just right. He stood abruptly as she reached the front of the table. </p><p>\t\u201cArya?\u201d He whispered his eyes watering the slightest bit. She smiled up at him and moved to stand directly in front of him. He couldn\u2019t stand idly any longer, so he took the remaining step to pick her up and wrap her in a tight embrace. His face was buried in her neck and her loose hair tickled the sides if his face that his small beard did not cover. </p><p>\t\u201cLord Baratheon, it\u2019s a pleasure to see you.\u201d She said coyly when he set her back on the ground. They both moved to sit at the table where Arya had her reunion with her remaining family members. The night went on after that. Arya told everyone of her adventures in Braavos and how she spent time sailing across the seas. Unlike the rest of the members at the table, Gendry was waiting for her to tell them all that she would be leaving again, but she did not get the chance as the tables were moved and the dancing commenced. Everyone at the head table stood to lead their significant others to the dance floor. Gendry looked at her and scratched the back of his neck before asking if she\u2019d like to dance. He knew it was a stupid question as soon as it left his mouth, but she stood and grabbed his hand anyway, pulling him gently to the side of the room to dance. He rested one of his hands on her hip and the other held her hand in his own. They danced in silence for a moment before she began to speak. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that you still haven\u2019t taken a wife. Jon says there have been plenty of options, but you\u2019ve refused them all. You need to produce an heir for Storms End one day Gendry. Why haven\u2019t you wed yet?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNone of the other women compare to the one I want.\u201d Gendry said calmly, looking her in the eye. \u201cIt makes it difficult to settle when she is always in the back of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell why don\u2019t you tell her stupid?\u201d She quipped gently, and it slipped from his mouth before he could stop himself.</p><p>\t\u201cI am.\u201d Arya stilled and looked at him closely then. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t have me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSays who?\u201d It was Gendry\u2019s turn to pause then. His hand gripped her hip a little tighter in that moment. \u201cThere was a time when I refused to marry, but I have long passed those days Gendry. I needed to return to Braavos and make sure that what I wanted was here and it is. I\u2019m not going anywhere, not unless you ask.\u201d</p><p>\tHe looked at her and moved so he held both of her hands in his. Taking a deep breath he looked up into her grey eyes. \u201cArya Stark, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes,\u201d she squeezed his hand and spoke again, this time much quieter. \u201cI can and will be your family Gendry Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\tHe smiled at her then and saw the look returned on her own face. Bending down he pressed a kiss to her forehead, \u201cI\u2019ll finally have a family of my own.\u201d</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>Day Two</h2><p><b>The Stark&rsquo;s throw a celebratory feast.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean I am required to attend the feast?&rdquo; Gendry asked, annoyed that he would be forced to attend something as propper as a feast. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Gendry, you&rsquo;ve been legitimized. You&rsquo;re a lord now. You have responsibilities!&rdquo; Jon argued, his friend&rsquo;s attitude threatening his temper to rise. &ldquo;Listen, I don&rsquo;t want to go anymore than you do. Feasts were never my favorite pastime growing up, but Sansa is throwing a feast in honor of defeating the army of the dead and Cersei. We both have no choice.&rdquo; </p><p>\tAs irritated as he was, Gendry nodded in understanding. He knew that getting legitimized would come with just as many consequences as it did perks, but he was naive to think he could escape the feasts. Jon spoke again, &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll finally find a wife. You know that we need to start rebuilding the world we took part in devastating in the great war.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re forcing me to attend this feast to help me find a pretty little bride?&rdquo; Gendry accused bitterly, &ldquo;you and I both know I&rsquo;m not going to find anyone there. The only chance I had at love left on a ship to Braavos as soon as the names on her list were crossed off.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I never said you need to find love,&rdquo; Jon said unabashed. &ldquo;You could find friendship instead. Maybe it would be like my fath- my uncle and lady Stark? You could grow to love one another.&rdquo;</p><p>\tGendry shook his head and raked his fingers through his growing hair. It was finally back to the length it was when he and Arya was traveling on the King&rsquo;s Road. Even thinking of her hurt. They had rekindled their friendship amidst the loss they suffered on the battlefield, their unspeakable bond forged once more. He had not been surprised when Arya revealed that she would once again be sailing to Braavos. He had half a mind to jump on the ship with her, unwilling to let her go, but he knew she needed to do this by herself. So he stood on the dock and waved her goodbye until she faded into the clouds across the sea. He remembered biting back tears that day, unwilling to let anyone other than her see his weakness. He had gotten the news of his legitimization days after she left and the ceremony was hard to bear without her by his side, but he did so just the same. It has been over a year since he&rsquo;d last seen her face. Things had started to settle in the realm, and so came the great feast that Queen Sansa was throwing. Everyone was surprised to hear the news of Jon&rsquo;s true parentage, Queen Daenerys especially. But she chose to fight by him just the same knowing that Jon held no interest in ruling the Seven Kingdoms, only the North. The universe had other plans though. It was nearing the end of the fight, everyone was too tired to keep going and the Dragon Queen noticed. She had mounted Drogon and flew directly at the Night King. Before anyone could blink dragon glass was raining from the sky as fire met ice in the sky above them. The spears that rained from the sky helped erase the army of the dead just enough for them to get a fighting chance. The sound that the ice dragon made when Rhaegal attacked him giving Drogon the upper hand was deafening. The two dragons were drove to the ground, both of them landing on the sharp spear of obsidian that stuck up from the ground. With the Night Kind vulnerable underneath the body of Viserion Jon approached him, Longclaw held in his hand tightly. The King in the North howled like the wolf he was when he brought his sword down, separating the Night King&rsquo;s head from the rest of his body. Daenerys wasted no time in flying down from above and destroying the ice king with one powerful word. </p><p>\tWith the great war fought and won the men and women relaxed. Each ecstatic with the unbelievable win, but that was when she struck. Cersei Lannister rode out with the Golden Company, devastating half their forces easily. It took one quick ride for Daenerys to wipe out half of the mercenaries and then half of that half, but on her third trip back a hair raising scream stretched across the battlefield. Every man and woman watched as a small body fell from the sky with a arrow protruding clearly from her chest. Drogon screeched from above and as he was distracted a large bolt flew from the ground, impaling itself in the creature&rsquo;s skull, and just like that dragons were once again wiped from the world. The fighting seemed to halt then, everyone in disbelief that the all-powerful Dragon Queen was dead. The Golden Company struct hard and with every last ounce of strength they had the combined armies fought for their lost queen. There would be time for mourning once the fighting was finished. Quickly the army bought from Tyrell gold had fallen and no one other than Arya Stark stood above Cersei Lannister&rsquo;s lifeless body holding her head up for everyone to see while a blood curdling scream echoed from her lips across the field of the fallen. They had lost so many people that day, but he hadn&rsquo;t lost her. Yet, he let her slip away from him once more when they returned to Winterfell. The castle was barely standing, many parts of it in ruin from the war. He was impressed that together they were able to restore it within the year. The ancestral seat of the Starks standing proud once more. Lady Sansa had made sure to wait for everything to be restored before she called everyone to feast at Winterfell once more, thinking it the best place for everyone who fought on the battlefield to be honored.
