        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nThe New JP Hero Billboard Chart Top 10 rankings were announced and the heroes\neach gave a short little speech. My new adult bird son Can You Smell What The\nHawk Is Cooking stole the spotlight by basically saying, \u201cy\u2019all need to stop\nbeing such bummers, we\u2019re the best that the world\u2019s got now so let\u2019s fucking\nact like it.\u201d We learned that Hawks is basically a hero prodigy, having started\nhis own hero agency at the tender young age of 18, and now having risen all the\nway to #2 at age 22. Anyway, he then handed the mic over to Endeavor who went\nwith the short and sweet \u201cjust watch me\u201d route, for better or worse. Afterwards\nEndeav throttled Hawks a little bit in the privacy of his dressing room, and\nHawks apologized and then said he actually needed Endeavor\u2019s help for\nsomething. \u201cDo you remember the Noumus?\u201d I then proceeded to lose my shit, as\nwe transitioned to some unknown location where an unknown figure was talking to\nan unknown Noumu with a Kurogiri face (!) who could TALK BACK (!!!!). Then I <i>really</i> lost my shit omg.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor and Hawks go for a stroll on their lunch break. Hawks casually saves like 15 random people and attracts a crowd of fans seeking autographs and selfies. Meanwhile Endeavor attracts one (1) fan, and tries to offer an autograph of his own only to send the kid running off in tears because Endeavor\u2019s aloof attitude is apparently what makes him cool lol. So as Endeav tries to sort all of that out, he sits down with Hawks in some fancy high-rise restaurant. Hawks tells him about some rumored Noumu sightings that he\u2019s been investigating all across the country. He says he flew out to the locations, but couldn\u2019t find any evidence. He theorizes that someone might be purposely spreading rumors in order to sow fear among the general populace. And he says he wants Endeavor, the newly crowned number one here, to be the one to put the people at ease. Meanwhile he himself just wants to chill out, and he would like nothing better than an ideal world so peaceful that heroes can just relax. Anyway, so then that Talking Noumu from the last chapter comes flying at them from out of nowhere and smashes through the glass and is all\u00a0\u201cWHICH ONE OF YOU IS STRONGEST.\u201d So Endeavor goes to fight him.</p><p><br/></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

Too Cool is just the persona he puts on because it\u2019s what\u2019s expected of him. but in actuality the reason he seems so nonchalant is because his heart isn\u2019t really in it. this was never something he wanted to do; it was something he was more or less forced into because he was so talented and With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, and so it didn\u2019t really matter what he personally wanted or didn\u2019t want. in other words, Hawks is the very first Reluctant Hero I think we\u2019ve had in this series. he\u2019s someone who is more or less trapped in his role, and by now he\u2019s become very, very good at what he does, but more than anything he would like to one day not have to do it anymore.</p><p>but of course not only does he not have that option, he\u2019s somehow managed to get himself in way deeper than most of his peers will ever have to worry about. not only does he have to contend with the everyday stresses of hero life, but he also has a fun undercover double agent mission to worry about! so add in the fear of being caught and the stress of having to play both sides, while all the while trying his best to make sure no innocents get hurt! and having to think about all of this constantly!</p><p>basically, up until now I wouldn\u2019t have thought that anyone could come along and actually contend with Aizawa for the title of Most Exhausted Character in the series. but not only does Hawks contend, I think it\u2019s actually no contest. and yet he does it anyway. without complaint. well with a little bit of complaining, but under the guise of being a lackadaisical young twenty-something who isn\u2019t particularly concerned about anything.\u00a0</p><p>he actually ends up confessing more to Endeavor than I would have expected, given all this. like he was straight up confiding in him. that all turned out to be completely true. but because he says it with that carefree smile, you don\u2019t realize at first how much he\u2019s just kind of quietly suffering underneath it all. like that dog in the house on fire saying this is fine. like, no it fucking isn\u2019t, but he puts on such a good act of being completely unconcerned. it\u2019s astounding in hindsight.</p><p>my god I have so many fucking feelings about Hawks apparently. I didn\u2019t mean to essay this much and there are probably more essays on the way too lol. I love my tired bird son too damn much and I hope to god he doesn\u2019t get himself killed fffff.)</p><ul><li>anyways he\u2019s signing autographs and giving interviews and\nshit, and meanwhile Endeavor is just completely being ignored</li><li>okay now they\u2019re acknowledging him, but it\u2019s the usual \u201cman,\nhe\u2019s scary!\u201d</li></ul><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"898\" data-orig-height=\"219\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b68fa916e4dea1c9c63db3cf3e2b2f7/tumblr_inline_podnowp1st1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"898\" data-orig-height=\"219\"/></figure><p><br/></p><ul><li>(ETA: CAN\u2019T YOU SEE-KUNNNNN)</li><li>this kid knows what\u2019s what.

Too Cool is just the persona he puts on because it\u2019s what\u2019s expected of him. but in actuality the reason he seems so nonchalant is because his heart isn\u2019t really in it. this was never something he wanted to do; it was something he was more or less forced into because he was so talented and With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, and so it didn\u2019t really matter what he personally wanted or didn\u2019t want. in other words, Hawks is the very first Reluctant Hero I think we\u2019ve had in this series. he\u2019s someone who is more or less trapped in his role, and by now he\u2019s become very, very good at what he does, but more than anything he would like to one day not have to do it anymore.</p><p>but of course not only does he not have that option, he\u2019s somehow managed to get himself in way deeper than most of his peers will ever have to worry about. not only does he have to contend with the everyday stresses of hero life, but he also has a fun undercover double agent mission to worry about! so add in the fear of being caught and the stress of having to play both sides, while all the while trying his best to make sure no innocents get hurt! and having to think about all of this constantly!</p><p>basically, up until now I wouldn\u2019t have thought that anyone could come along and actually contend with Aizawa for the title of Most Exhausted Character in the series. but not only does Hawks contend, I think it\u2019s actually no contest. and yet he does it anyway. without complaint. well with a little bit of complaining, but under the guise of being a lackadaisical young twenty-something who isn\u2019t particularly concerned about anything.\u00a0</p><p>he actually ends up confessing more to Endeavor than I would have expected, given all this. like he was straight up confiding in him. that all turned out to be completely true. but because he says it with that carefree smile, you don\u2019t realize at first how much he\u2019s just kind of quietly suffering underneath it all. like that dog in the house on fire saying this is fine. like, no it fucking isn\u2019t, but he puts on such a good act of being completely unconcerned. it\u2019s astounding in hindsight.</p><p>my god I have so many fucking feelings about Hawks apparently. I didn\u2019t mean to essay this much and there are probably more essays on the way too lol. I love my tired bird son too damn much and I hope to god he doesn\u2019t get himself killed fffff.)</p><ul><li>anyways he\u2019s signing autographs and giving interviews and\nshit, and meanwhile Endeavor is just completely being ignored</li><li>okay now they\u2019re acknowledging him, but it\u2019s the usual \u201cman,\nhe\u2019s scary!\u201d</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"898\" data-orig-height=\"219\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b68fa916e4dea1c9c63db3cf3e2b2f7/tumblr_inline_podnowp1st1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"898\" data-orig-height=\"219\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>(ETA: CAN\u2019T YOU SEE-KUNNNNN)</li><li>this kid knows what\u2019s what.

My new adult bird son Can You Smell What The\nHawk Is Cooking stole the spotlight by basically saying, \u201cy\u2019all need to stop\nbeing such bummers, we\u2019re the best that the world\u2019s got now so let\u2019s fucking\nact like it.\u201d We learned that Hawks is basically a hero prodigy, having started\nhis own hero agency at the tender young age of 18, and now having risen all the\nway to #2 at age 22. Anyway, he then handed the mic over to Endeavor who went\nwith the short and sweet \u201cjust watch me\u201d route, for better or worse. Afterwards\nEndeav throttled Hawks a little bit in the privacy of his dressing room, and\nHawks apologized and then said he actually needed Endeavor\u2019s help for\nsomething. \u201cDo you remember the Noumus?\u201d I then proceeded to lose my shit, as\nwe transitioned to some unknown location where an unknown figure was talking to\nan unknown Noumu with a Kurogiri face (!) who could TALK BACK (!!!!). Then I <i>really</i> lost my shit omg.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor and Hawks go for a stroll on their lunch break. Hawks casually saves like 15 random people and attracts a crowd of fans seeking autographs and selfies. Meanwhile Endeavor attracts one (1) fan, and tries to offer an autograph of his own only to send the kid running off in tears because Endeavor\u2019s aloof attitude is apparently what makes him cool lol. So as Endeav tries to sort all of that out, he sits down with Hawks in some fancy high-rise restaurant. Hawks tells him about some rumored Noumu sightings that he\u2019s been investigating all across the country. He says he flew out to the locations, but couldn\u2019t find any evidence. He theorizes that someone might be purposely spreading rumors in order to sow fear among the general populace. And he says he wants Endeavor, the newly crowned number one here, to be the one to put the people at ease. Meanwhile he himself just wants to chill out, and he would like nothing better than an ideal world so peaceful that heroes can just relax. Anyway, so then that Talking Noumu from the last chapter comes flying at them from out of nowhere and smashes through the glass and is all\u00a0\u201cWHICH ONE OF YOU IS STRONGEST.\u201d So Endeavor goes to fight him.</p><p><br></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

Too Cool is just the persona he puts on because it\u2019s what\u2019s expected of him. but in actuality the reason he seems so nonchalant is because his heart isn\u2019t really in it. this was never something he wanted to do; it was something he was more or less forced into because he was so talented and With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, and so it didn\u2019t really matter what he personally wanted or didn\u2019t want. in other words, Hawks is the very first Reluctant Hero I think we\u2019ve had in this series. he\u2019s someone who is more or less trapped in his role, and by now he\u2019s become very, very good at what he does, but more than anything he would like to one day not have to do it anymore.</p><p>but of course not only does he not have that option, he\u2019s somehow managed to get himself in way deeper than most of his peers will ever have to worry about. not only does he have to contend with the everyday stresses of hero life, but he also has a fun undercover double agent mission to worry about! so add in the fear of being caught and the stress of having to play both sides, while all the while trying his best to make sure no innocents get hurt! and having to think about all of this constantly!</p><p>basically, up until now I wouldn\u2019t have thought that anyone could come along and actually contend with Aizawa for the title of Most Exhausted Character in the series. but not only does Hawks contend, I think it\u2019s actually no contest. and yet he does it anyway. without complaint. well with a little bit of complaining, but under the guise of being a lackadaisical young twenty-something who isn\u2019t particularly concerned about anything.\u00a0</p><p>he actually ends up confessing more to Endeavor than I would have expected, given all this. like he was straight up confiding in him. that all turned out to be completely true. but because he says it with that carefree smile, you don\u2019t realize at first how much he\u2019s just kind of quietly suffering underneath it all. like that dog in the house on fire saying this is fine. like, no it fucking isn\u2019t, but he puts on such a good act of being completely unconcerned. it\u2019s astounding in hindsight.</p><p>my god I have so many fucking feelings about Hawks apparently.

                "content": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nThe New JP Hero Billboard Chart Top 10 rankings were announced and the heroes\neach gave a short little speech. My new adult bird son Can You Smell What The\nHawk Is Cooking stole the spotlight by basically saying, &ldquo;y&rsquo;all need to stop\nbeing such bummers, we&rsquo;re the best that the world&rsquo;s got now so let&rsquo;s fucking\nact like it.&rdquo; We learned that Hawks is basically a hero prodigy, having started\nhis own hero agency at the tender young age of 18, and now having risen all the\nway to #2 at age 22. Anyway, he then handed the mic over to Endeavor who went\nwith the short and sweet &ldquo;just watch me&rdquo; route, for better or worse. Afterwards\nEndeav throttled Hawks a little bit in the privacy of his dressing room, and\nHawks apologized and then said he actually needed Endeavor&rsquo;s help for\nsomething. &ldquo;Do you remember the Noumus?&rdquo; I then proceeded to lose my shit, as\nwe transitioned to some unknown location where an unknown figure was talking to\nan unknown Noumu with a Kurogiri face (!) who could TALK BACK (!!!!). Then I <i>really</i> lost my shit omg.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor and Hawks go for a stroll on their lunch break. Hawks casually saves like 15 random people and attracts a crowd of fans seeking autographs and selfies. Meanwhile Endeavor attracts one (1) fan, and tries to offer an autograph of his own only to send the kid running off in tears because Endeavor&rsquo;s aloof attitude is apparently what makes him cool lol. So as Endeav tries to sort all of that out, he sits down with Hawks in some fancy high-rise restaurant. Hawks tells him about some rumored Noumu sightings that he&rsquo;s been investigating all across the country. He says he flew out to the locations, but couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence. He theorizes that someone might be purposely spreading rumors in order to sow fear among the general populace. And he says he wants Endeavor, the newly crowned number one here, to be the one to put the people at ease. Meanwhile he himself just wants to chill out, and he would like nothing better than an ideal world so peaceful that heroes can just relax.

Too Cool is just the persona he puts on because it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s expected of him. but in actuality the reason he seems so nonchalant is because his heart isn&rsquo;t really in it. this was never something he wanted to do; it was something he was more or less forced into because he was so talented and With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, and so it didn&rsquo;t really matter what he personally wanted or didn&rsquo;t want. in other words, Hawks is the very first Reluctant Hero I think we&rsquo;ve had in this series. he&rsquo;s someone who is more or less trapped in his role, and by now he&rsquo;s become very, very good at what he does, but more than anything he would like to one day not have to do it anymore.</p><p>but of course not only does he not have that option, he&rsquo;s somehow managed to get himself in way deeper than most of his peers will ever have to worry about. not only does he have to contend with the everyday stresses of hero life, but he also has a fun undercover double agent mission to worry about! so add in the fear of being caught and the stress of having to play both sides, while all the while trying his best to make sure no innocents get hurt! and having to think about all of this constantly!</p><p>basically, up until now I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that anyone could come along and actually contend with Aizawa for the title of Most Exhausted Character in the series. but not only does Hawks contend, I think it&rsquo;s actually no contest. and yet he does it anyway. without complaint. well with a little bit of complaining, but under the guise of being a lackadaisical young twenty-something who isn&rsquo;t particularly concerned about anything.&nbsp;</p><p>he actually ends up confessing more to Endeavor than I would have expected, given all this. like he was straight up confiding in him. that all turned out to be completely true. but because he says it with that carefree smile, you don&rsquo;t realize at first how much he&rsquo;s just kind of quietly suffering underneath it all. like that dog in the house on fire saying this is fine. like, no it fucking isn&rsquo;t, but he puts on such a good act of being completely unconcerned. it&rsquo;s astounding in hindsight.</p><p>my god I have so many fucking feelings about Hawks apparently.

My new adult bird son Can You Smell What The\nHawk Is Cooking stole the spotlight by basically saying, &ldquo;y&rsquo;all need to stop\nbeing such bummers, we&rsquo;re the best that the world&rsquo;s got now so let&rsquo;s fucking\nact like it.&rdquo; We learned that Hawks is basically a hero prodigy, having started\nhis own hero agency at the tender young age of 18, and now having risen all the\nway to #2 at age 22. Anyway, he then handed the mic over to Endeavor who went\nwith the short and sweet &ldquo;just watch me&rdquo; route, for better or worse. Afterwards\nEndeav throttled Hawks a little bit in the privacy of his dressing room, and\nHawks apologized and then said he actually needed Endeavor&rsquo;s help for\nsomething. &ldquo;Do you remember the Noumus?&rdquo; I then proceeded to lose my shit, as\nwe transitioned to some unknown location where an unknown figure was talking to\nan unknown Noumu with a Kurogiri face (!) who could TALK BACK (!!!!). Then I <i>really</i> lost my shit omg.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor and Hawks go for a stroll on their lunch break. Hawks casually saves like 15 random people and attracts a crowd of fans seeking autographs and selfies. Meanwhile Endeavor attracts one (1) fan, and tries to offer an autograph of his own only to send the kid running off in tears because Endeavor&rsquo;s aloof attitude is apparently what makes him cool lol. So as Endeav tries to sort all of that out, he sits down with Hawks in some fancy high-rise restaurant. Hawks tells him about some rumored Noumu sightings that he&rsquo;s been investigating all across the country. He says he flew out to the locations, but couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence. He theorizes that someone might be purposely spreading rumors in order to sow fear among the general populace. And he says he wants Endeavor, the newly crowned number one here, to be the one to put the people at ease. Meanwhile he himself just wants to chill out, and he would like nothing better than an ideal world so peaceful that heroes can just relax. Anyway, so then that Talking Noumu from the last chapter comes flying at them from out of nowhere and smashes through the glass and is all&nbsp;&ldquo;WHICH ONE OF YOU IS STRONGEST.&rdquo; So Endeavor goes to fight him.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.
