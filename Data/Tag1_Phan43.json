Most are ones that make complete sense,\nlike wearing a lab coat and goggles. Some, when you\u2019ve know a little about\nchemistry, make sense. However, the one rule that Dan Howell would have not\nthought of before starting his bachelor in chemistry, was that you are not\nallowed to wear shorts in the lab. When you wear short during a lab, you will\nbe removed from the lab. </p><p>Even on the hottest days in the year,\npeople kept to this rule. They would bring long pants to class, and change into\nthem just beforehand. As a third year chem student you knew you could not miss\na single lab assignment.</p><p>And on a faithful day in early June, Dan\nHowell woke up at 15 minutes to 8, meaning he had 25 minutes to get to the lab\nand sign in, before one of his final lab assignments would start.</p><p>On this particular day, Dan also woke up\nincredibly sweaty. It was already 24 degrees outside, and if it was going to be\nanything like yesterday, it would 35 by the time he would be done with his lab.</p><p>He pulled on the first clothing items he\ncould find, not bothering to check if they were clean or not. It was a minimum\n15 minute walk to the lab from his dorms, so he should be just in time, if he\nsprinted a bit. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Just as Dan was about to sign in, he\nnoticed something. In the hurry to get dressed this morning, he\u2019d put on a pair\nof shorts. He could not, under any circumstances, miss this lab. He debated his\noptions briefly, and without checking for the time, started sprinting back to\nhis dorm.</p><p>As he ran, he ran past the big clock in the\nauditorium. It was already 8:03. He was never going to make it in time.</p><p>He looked around desperately. At the other\nend of the auditorium a tall man was stood next to the coffee machine, wearing\nsweat pants. Dan sprinted through the auditorium, coming to a screeching halt\nin front of the stranger. Terribly out of breath, he blurted out: \u201cCan I borrow\nyour pants. I need your pants desperately,\u201d</p><p>Just as the stranger was about to reply, to\ncall him out for his insanity, Dan was sure, he started talking again. \u201cI just\nneed them for my lab. I have 5 minutes to sign in. come on, I\u2019ll give you my\nnumber and I\u2019ll return the pants to you, cleaned.\u201d</p><p>Dan must have had an angel on his shoulder.\nThe stranger nodded, albeit a tad confused. Dan pulled him into the nearest\nbathroom. As they changed pants, Dan laid his phone for the stranger to add\nhimself as a contact.</p><p>\u201cThank you, you\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d Dan said\nas he started sprinting back to the lab.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>In retrospect, Dan should\u2019ve known that\nthis is how fate would treat him. Of course, he would meet the cutest and\nhottest guy ever, and then have to ask him to switch pants. Was he ever going\nto have a chance to redeem himself? Probably not.</p><p>Still, he gathered the little courage he\nhad, and opened up a new message to the guy, whom he\u2019d just noticed had named\nhimself \u2018Pants\u2019. </p><p><b>Dan\n(15:36): </b><i>hey,\nthis is the guy from this morning who screamed that he needed your pants. As I\nsaid, I\u2019ll wash them and give them back to you</i></p><p><b>Dan\n(15:36): </b><i>do\nyou want them back soon??</i></p><p><b>Dan\n(15:36): </b><i>like\nyou need them tomorrow or something</i></p><p><b>Dan\n(15:37): </b><i>oh\ngod I sound like an asshole</i><b></b></p><p><b>Dan\n(15:37): </b><i>I\u2019ll\nstop spamming now</i></p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Honestly, Dan forgot about the messages. He\nspent the next six hours writing an entire essay that was due the next morning,\nand didn\u2019t check his phone for a few hours. When he shut his laptop, worn to\nthe bone and unable to write another word about carbon structures, he opened\nhis phone for the first time in about 3 hours.</p><p><b>Pants\n(22:18): </b><i>I liked\nthe spam ;)</i></p><p><b>Pants\n(22:18): </b><i>I\u2019m\nin no hurry to get them back</i></p><p><b>Pants\n(22:19): </b><i>Maybe\nwe can meet for coffee later this week, and you can give them back then ;)</i></p><p>Maybe Dan stared at the winky faces for too\nlong, and definitely overanalysed them, but he was kind of hoping that this\nvery hot-yet-cute guy was into him.</p><p><b>Dan\n(23:56): </b><i>i\u2019d\nlike that</i></p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>That\u2019s how, on a Friday afternoon, Dan was\nwaiting in front of the on-campus coffee shop, for some guy he only knew as \u2018pants\u2019.\nAt least he knew he was a real person, which was an improvement from Tinder hook-ups.</p><p>Luckily he didn\u2019t have to stand around for\ntoo long. \u2018Pants\u2019 came around the corner, still as hot as Dan remembered him to\nbe. As \u2018pants\u2019 looked up, Dan was instantly reminded of the\ntoo-blue-to-be-human eyes. He smiled when they made eye contact, and felt his cheek\ndimple.</p><p>\u201cHey. I realised that I haven\u2019t properly\nintroduced myself. I\u2019m Phil, or as you might know me, \u2018Pants\u2019,\u201d he said, upon\ngetting close enough that Dan could hear. He extended his hand forward. Shakily\nDan reached forward to shake it.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Dan. Thanks again for letting\nme borrow your pants,\u201d he said, slightly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d always lend my pants to cute\nguys, especially if they might want me to take them off later.\u201d He winked as he\nsaid it.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t know whether to cringe or be\naroused, so instead he let himself be a combination of both. \u201cGod, you did not\njust say that!\u201d</p><p>Together they laughed, and internally Dan\nthought, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to lose his company soon.\u2019 As they headed\ninside, their hands brushed, and after a second, Phil intertwined their fingers\nand squeezed lightly.</p>",
