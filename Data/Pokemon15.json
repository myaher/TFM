All the pokemon fans&nbsp;<strike>and non-pokemon fans who only know what pikachu is&nbsp;</strike>have seen or at least heard of the detective pikachu film, but you DID know that it is based on a spin-off game published to the Nintendo 3DS right?<br /><br />Well, I&rsquo;ve played both the spin-off, and watched the movie on the premiere date, so I have tea to be spilt.<br /><br />First of all, they have the same plot. The same underlying plot. Just vastly different execution, like every movie based on a game/book would be. If I were to criticize the movie itself, I&rsquo;d say&nbsp;&ldquo;It was great! Lots of different pokemon had exposure, and so much lore on the world of pokemon was revealed. There was a lot of cute, funny, and heartwarming stuff that really made the pokemon fan in me smile.&rdquo; <b>BUT OHOHOHOHO- <i>NO!</i></b> When compared to the game itself, it feels extremely underwhelming.</p><p>time for some nitpicking (hell yeah)</p><p><b>1.
