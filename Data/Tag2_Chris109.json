His agent tells him about the pictures online and asks who\u2019s the woman with him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a friend, she\u2019s right here having dinner with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she has a boyfriend.\u201d he puts his hand to cover the speaker and tell Harper what\u2019s going on \u201cThere are pictures of us leaving the gym online. You are \u2018mysterious girl\u2019, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always mysterious girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to release a note about it? Do you want me to yell your name in the streets tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and says it\u2019s okay. He goes back to talking to his agent.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u00b4m&hellip;not really going to say anything. If someone call just tells them she\u2019s a friend, she\u2019s currently leaving at my building, so&hellip;that\u2019s why we leave to and come back from the gym together\u2026\u201d</p><p>He talks for a couple of minutes more with Gwen then goes back to the table.</p><p>\u201cAre you really okay with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am if you are&hellip;I\u2019m just surprised cause I was waiting for this to happen, with all the times Chris and I went out and about; and when it does happen it\u2019s with the wrong guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmy will be pissed\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call her before she sees it, then\u201d not that she\u2019s her best friend but Emmy was kind of nice to her at the karaoke. With some horrible bits of advice and offering drugs&hellip;and she\u2019s not good to Sebastian, really&hellip;</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly talking right now\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did some shit I\u2019m not okay with\u2026\u201d it\u2019s clear by his body language that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about this, so she let it go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u201d kind of.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we weren\u2019t really in love, she\u2019s nice and we know each other for a long time, but&hellip;it wasn\u2019t serious. What I need to warn you about is that my fans can be a bit scary sometimes.\u201c</p><p>\u201cScary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, maybe you should talk with Chris about this. I mean&hellip;if someone is going to hate you is only fair that it\u2019s because of your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a great talk \u2018hey Chris, maybe we should publish something about us cause I would like to be hated for the right reasons!\u201d They laugh and talk a bit more about how paps were not the same as they used to be. After dinner, they move to the couch with beer bottles and chocolate cake.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever wanted to be a singer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I dreamed of it when I was younger\u2026first I really wanted was to be an actress, but I have no talent to act, so that was out of the question&hellip;but then I fell in love with music&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I hear a song that it\u2019s about me, it gets me nervous and emotional. Imagine what it would be like to sing it&hellip;to hear people singing with me&hellip;I don\u2019t think I have the emotional stability to deal with something so raw, you know? But I really like what I do, I\u2019m happy with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are songs about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes&hellip;I used to date Caleb\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vocalist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you show me which ones are for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes is just a phrase\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, show me at least one..\u201d he turns the Bluetooth of his radio on and passes her his phone, where she puts on a song. They listen to a couple of music while talking about their meaning.</p><p>\u201cThis is really deep..I don\u2019t know much of their songs, just the most famous ones&hellip;but this, this is a love song\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and believe me when I said it is easy to lose yourself in this dream-like situation. I was 19 and in love with the singer of a rock band and I was the most important thing in his life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, It\u2019s the kind of thing any guy after would have a big problem to surpass\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one had to try&hellip;When we broke up it took me so much time to get over it. It was as if he was this god I would worship anyway, you know? And in some way, things were the same for him. We had this closeness that we didn\u2019t want to end and we weren\u2019t trying to turn away from it. But at the same time, I was hurt and angry, so it was a mess&hellip;I doubt my own judgment about everything I did and how I remember things\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take for you to date again?\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 years?\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 fucking years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had dates and one night stands but to really start a relationship? That\u2019s just happening now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your relationship with Caleb now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow&hellip;we\u2019ve made peace with this strange feeling that I guess won\u2019t ever go away. But we see each other much less. When we\u2019re recording though I feel like we have this understanding that is amazing and I\u2019m just glad we still have something that\u2019s just ours\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful love story\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit broken..\u201d she smiles.</p><p>\u201cA true one. Not all stories have a \u2018happy forever\u2019 ending \u201d</p><p>\u201cYour right\u2026Well, it\u2019s getting late, I better go, I have to work out with this hot Hollywood actor tomorrow and I can\u2019t go looking like a panda, I\u2019m pretty sure the paps will be there\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou replaced me already?\u201d he jests.</p><p>She laughs and throws a cushion on him. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Seb\u201d</p><p>He hugs her and whispers in her ear \u201cThank you for your company, doll, I really like talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s getting ready to bed when her phone beeps</p><p><i>- So, I was thinking, are you the sex on fire girl?</i></p><p><i>- Shut up.</i></p><p><i>- Your sex is so famous!</i></p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer, just laughs and go to sleep. She misses Chris\u2019 text: \u00a0</p><p><i>Are you awake? I want to talk to you.</i></p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t sleep. He spends the whole night looking at her pics on Instagram&hellip;he feels like a stupid teenager. His friends convinced him to stay but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her in New York with his so-called friend. He falls asleep on the couch and only wakes when it\u2019s past 10 in the morning. A missed call and a text from Harper on his phone.</p><p><i>Hey sugar, sorry I fell asleep yesterday. How are you? Having fun? I\u2019m going to the gym now, can we facetime while I\u2019m on lunch break? Let me know. Miss you</i>.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer it. When it\u2019s time for her lunch break, she calls him, but he doesn\u2019t answer that too.</p><p><i>Hey handsome, I hope you\u2019re good. I\u2019ll be out of the studio at 6 pm if you\u2019re free to talk. Have fun!</i></p><p>Harper misses him, but she thinks the only reason for him not to pick her calls is that he\u2019s having fun with his friends, so she doesn\u2019t press him. Chris mistakes this as lack of interest. It\u2019s almost 7 pm when Sebastian calls her and asks if she would go with him to the market, she was on PJs, so she changes to meet him.

I was 19 and in love with the singer of a rock band and I was the most important thing in his life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, It\u2019s the kind of thing any guy after would have a big problem to surpass\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one had to try\u2026When we broke up it took me so much time to get over it. It was as if he was this god I would worship anyway, you know? And in some way, things were the same for him. We had this closeness that we didn\u2019t want to end and we weren\u2019t trying to turn away from it. But at the same time, I was hurt and angry, so it was a mess\u2026I doubt my own judgment about everything I did and how I remember things\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take for you to date again?\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 years?\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 fucking years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had dates and one night stands but to really start a relationship?

Not all stories have a \u2018happy forever\u2019 ending \u201d</p><p>\u201cYour right\u2026Well, it\u2019s getting late, I better go, I have to work out with this hot Hollywood actor tomorrow and I can\u2019t go looking like a panda, I\u2019m pretty sure the paps will be there\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou replaced me already?\u201d he jests.</p><p>She laughs and throws a cushion on him. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Seb\u201d</p><p>He hugs her and whispers in her ear \u201cThank you for your company, doll, I really like talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s getting ready to bed when her phone beeps</p><p><i>- So, I was thinking, are you the sex on fire girl?</i></p><p><i>- Shut up.</i></p><p><i>- Your sex is so famous!</i></p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer, just laughs and go to sleep. She misses Chris\u2019 text: \u00a0</p><p><i>Are you awake? I want to talk to you.</i></p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t sleep. He spends the whole night looking at her pics on Instagram\u2026he feels like a stupid teenager. His friends convinced him to stay but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her in New York with his so-called friend. He falls asleep on the couch and only wakes when it\u2019s past 10 in the morning. A missed call and a text from Harper on his phone.</p><p><i>Hey sugar, sorry I fell asleep yesterday. How are you? Having fun? I\u2019m going to the gym now, can we facetime while I\u2019m on lunch break? Let me know. Miss you</i>.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer it. When it\u2019s time for her lunch break, she calls him, but he doesn\u2019t answer that too.</p><p><i>Hey handsome, I hope you\u2019re good. I\u2019ll be out of the studio at 6 pm if you\u2019re free to talk. Have fun!</i></p><p>Harper misses him, but she thinks the only reason for him not to pick her calls is that he\u2019s having fun with his friends, so she doesn\u2019t press him. Chris mistakes this as lack of interest. It\u2019s almost 7 pm when Sebastian calls her and asks if she would go with him to the market, she was on PJs, so she changes to meet him. After half an hour of getting groceries and talking about their work, he invites her to see a movie, so she goes to his apartment. It took them forever to decide on a movie and they end up watching The Shining. At some point they got closer, cuddling comfortably at the couch till she falls asleep.</p><p>\u201cDarling, do you want to go to bed?\u201d he whispers, petting her hair.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m going\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look so cute\u2026you can stay on my bed if you want to, I can take the couch\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna take your bed just cause I\u2019m tired..I\u2019m just some floors up..have a good night, Seb\u201d she kisses his cheek and goes home.

Chris mistakes this as lack of interest. It\u2019s almost 7 pm when Sebastian calls her and asks if she would go with him to the market, she was on PJs, so she changes to meet him. After half an hour of getting groceries and talking about their work, he invites her to see a movie, so she goes to his apartment. It took them forever to decide on a movie and they end up watching The Shining. At some point they got closer, cuddling comfortably at the couch till she falls asleep.</p><p>\u201cDarling, do you want to go to bed?\u201d he whispers, petting her hair.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m going\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look so cute\u2026you can stay on my bed if you want to, I can take the couch\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna take your bed just cause I\u2019m tired..I\u2019m just some floors up..have a good night, Seb\u201d she kisses his cheek and goes home. She was so tired she just went straight to bed so she misses the texts Chris sends her and a couple of calls.</p><p><i>I\u2019m in NY. Are you at Sebastian\u2019s?</i></p><p><i>I would like to see you.</i></p><p><i>Pick up, Harper, I\u2019m getting worried.</i></p><p>She only wakes when she hears the doorbell ringing and goes to open the door. When she spies the peephole and sees Chris, her heart bursts and she opens the door hugging him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back! I missed you!\u201d she jumps in his arms and he hugs her back, walking inside.</p><p>\u201cI was calling and you didn\u2019t pick up.

His agent tells him about the pictures online and asks who&rsquo;s the woman with him.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a friend, she&rsquo;s right here having dinner with me now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a friend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she has a boyfriend.&rdquo; he puts his hand to cover the speaker and tell Harper what&rsquo;s going on &ldquo;There are pictures of us leaving the gym online. You are &lsquo;mysterious girl&rsquo;, now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always mysterious girl!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to release a note about it? Do you want me to yell your name in the streets tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughs and says it&rsquo;s okay. He goes back to talking to his agent.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&acute;m&hellip;not really going to say anything. If someone call just tells them she&rsquo;s a friend, she&rsquo;s currently leaving at my building, so&hellip;that&rsquo;s why we leave to and come back from the gym together&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He talks for a couple of minutes more with Gwen then goes back to the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you really okay with this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am if you are&hellip;I&rsquo;m just surprised cause I was waiting for this to happen, with all the times Chris and I went out and about; and when it does happen it&rsquo;s with the wrong guy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Emmy will be pissed&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should call her before she sees it, then&rdquo; not that she&rsquo;s her best friend but Emmy was kind of nice to her at the karaoke. With some horrible bits of advice and offering drugs&hellip;and she&rsquo;s not good to Sebastian, really&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not exactly talking right now&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She did some shit I&rsquo;m not okay with&hellip;&rdquo; it&rsquo;s clear by his body language that he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about this, so she let it go.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that&rdquo; kind of.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, we weren&rsquo;t really in love, she&rsquo;s nice and we know each other for a long time, but&hellip;it wasn&rsquo;t serious. What I need to warn you about is that my fans can be a bit scary sometimes.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, maybe you should talk with Chris about this. I mean&hellip;if someone is going to hate you is only fair that it&rsquo;s because of your boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to be a great talk &lsquo;hey Chris, maybe we should publish something about us cause I would like to be hated for the right reasons!&rdquo; They laugh and talk a bit more about how paps were not the same as they used to be. After dinner, they move to the couch with beer bottles and chocolate cake.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you ever wanted to be a singer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I dreamed of it when I was younger&hellip;first I really wanted was to be an actress, but I have no talent to act, so that was out of the question&hellip;but then I fell in love with music&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I hear a song that it&rsquo;s about me, it gets me nervous and emotional. Imagine what it would be like to sing it&hellip;to hear people singing with me&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think I have the emotional stability to deal with something so raw, you know? But I really like what I do, I&rsquo;m happy with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are songs about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;I used to date Caleb&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The vocalist?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you show me which ones are for you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes is just a phrase&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, show me at least one..&rdquo; he turns the Bluetooth of his radio on and passes her his phone, where she puts on a song. They listen to a couple of music while talking about their meaning.</p><p>&ldquo;This is really deep..I don&rsquo;t know much of their songs, just the most famous ones&hellip;but this, this is a love song&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and believe me when I said it is easy to lose yourself in this dream-like situation. I was 19 and in love with the singer of a rock band and I was the most important thing in his life!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, It&rsquo;s the kind of thing any guy after would have a big problem to surpass&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And no one had to try&hellip;When we broke up it took me so much time to get over it. It was as if he was this god I would worship anyway, you know? And in some way, things were the same for him. We had this closeness that we didn&rsquo;t want to end and we weren&rsquo;t trying to turn away from it. But at the same time, I was hurt and angry, so it was a mess&hellip;I doubt my own judgment about everything I did and how I remember things&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long did it take for you to date again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;10 years?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;10 fucking years?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I had dates and one night stands but to really start a relationship? That&rsquo;s just happening now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your relationship with Caleb now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now&hellip;we&rsquo;ve made peace with this strange feeling that I guess won&rsquo;t ever go away. But we see each other much less.

His arms were still securely wrapped around your waist and yours around his neck. Your breath mixed with eachother and you\u2019re suddenly afraid to so much as sniffle.</p><p>The moment was heart-stoppingly intimate. Like no other kiss could ever even dream of being.\u00a0</p><p>Something about having your heart and not your body laid bare was somehow worse. You were vulnerable and he was right there to support you. It only proved what you thought of him right. He was one of the kindest people you\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Your chest burns with an overwhelming emotion too strong and consuming for you to even <i>attempt </i>to decipher.</p><p>Swallowing hard, you look at him through your slightly wet lashes. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn to do that?\u201d</p><p>Try as you might, the small strain in your voice still makes it through and so God help you, Mr. Evans can clearly see how nervous he makes you.</p><p>In comparison to you, he seems completely confident and comfortable. He makes you feel tiny in all ways possible.\u00a0</p><p>He smiles almost adoringly down at you and you wonder if he realizes that you\u2019re so close your noses are brushing.</p><p>His voice is husky when he speaks and you realize maybe he\u2019s not as cool as he\u2019s trying to seem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI read it helped if someone you trust did it.\u201d His gaze flickers up from your lips to your eyes and a shiver travels through you at the weight of his gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it\u2019d work but I panicked.\u201d</p><p>Your gaze snaps right back to his lips and the air crackles with electricity. Subconsciously, you wet your lips, your throat feeling dry.</p><p>\u201cT-thank you.\u201d</p><p>His thumb casually draws light circles on your hip and your lips part slightly at the sensation. His gaze is soft as a leftover tear makes its way out of your eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>His other thumb softly brushes the tear away and you barely hold back a gasp at his sudden feather-like touch. His eyes seem just as glued to your face as yours to his.</p><p>The atmosphere had completely shifted as you both realize how close you are and how impossible it seemed to move from the other. It was almost magnetic, the pull between you. So strong and&hellip;.you can\u2019t possibly look away from his eyes. Not that you want to either way.</p><p>Your heart is beating so fast in your chest, you think it\u2019s a miracle it wasn\u2019t lodged in your throat right now.</p><p>You gulp, tightening your hold on his neck as your head grows fainter and fainter the longer you stare into those intoxicating blue irises.</p><p>So deep. So&hellip;beautiful.</p><p>Eventually, you begin leaning in closer to him, drawn by an inexplicable force. His breath hitches when your slight movement causes your chest to press into his further.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so fucking firm</i>. You barely hold back the raggedy moan making its way up your throat. You could easily feel every firm curve made purely of muscle and it was setting your skin aflame.</p><p>His warm breath sent tingles all over your body, the delicious cinnamon scent not aiding your aching soul in the least. Your lips were only a few inches apart.\u00a0</p><p>His lips, so pink and full and kissable&hellip;</p><p>Your gaze flickers to his and you look at him from under you lashes heatedly, convinced he could feel just how hard you were breathing.</p><p>The tension between you was so great, you felt almost as if you were being suffocated by the mere pressure of it.</p><p>In response, his gaze grazes every inch of your face shamelessly. It was almost as if he wanted to drink your features in. Soak them into his memory to keep forever.</p><p>\u00a0He eyes that small birthmark and the corner of his lips curls affectionately. He does this for your nose and your brows and your cheeks and your lips where he takes a few extra seconds to fully admire them, taking in every bump and area of soft pink skin, and you wonder if he can see its desperately yelling of it\u2019s want for his own irresistible lips.\u00a0</p><p>You follow his gaze and watch in fascination as the baby blue irises darken to a deep aqua blue right before your eyes and his pupils dilate almost completely. His breathing was hard too, and it made you wonder- hope- that maybe he was as affected by you as you by him.</p><p>His soft hand cups your face and his other one continues to draw circles onto your clothed hip, almost drawing another shuddering breath from you.</p><p>He breathes, \u201care you okay?\u201d</p><p>You have to swallow the huge lump in your throat as his warmth seeps into your skin, but manage to rasp a somewhat coherent sentence through all the want coursing through your system.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You?\u201d</p><p>He smiles adoringly, looking deep into your eyes. \u201cI\u2019m more than okay.\u201d</p><p>When he speaks- and you swear to everything good you tried to ignore how good the tingles it ignites in you made you feel- his lips brush against yours and you finally realize just how easy it\u2019d be to just&hellip;kiss him. Right here right now.</p><p>Oh Gosh! But this-this was so wrong. So, so wrong. Like, soooo wrong. He was your teacher. He-he was far older than you and you were just&hellip;you. Plain old, boring, embarrassingly inexperienced Y/n.</p><p>And yet&hellip;.you couldn\u2019t find it in you to give a single damn. Not right now, in this very moment with both of you so willing to disregard everything and everyone telling you no.\u00a0</p><p>And maybe that was what was really wrong. Maybe the fact that his touch is enough to wash any trace of reason or rationalization from your brain and turn you into utter mush is dangerous and forbidden.</p><p>But you\u2019ve wanted this for so damn long. You\u2019ve literally <i>dreamt </i>of this moment. Countless nights spent wondering what his lips would feel against yours and finally&hellip;the opportunity was here. And you were so damn ready.\u00a0</p><p>The tender brushing of his fingers had made your skin hyperaware in a way you had no idea even existed. Every nerve in you stands at attention, magnifying the heavenly sensation of the pads of his fingers brushing your slightly damp skin even more.\u00a0</p><p>He breathes out shakily and leans in closer to you, tilting his head to the side slightly. Your breath hitches and all the while, his fingers trail torturously slow up to your hair and his fingertips dance teasing over your skin as he brushes strands stuck to your temples away, tucking it behind your ear.</p><p>His gaze is so dark now, you barely recognize his eyes, the glistening blue irises almost completely gone and replaced with a dark, almost feral look filled with want equally as much as adoration.</p><p>You hold your breath as your heart pounds harshly against your ribcage. Your brain completely blank. Not a single thought on how wrong this was or the possibility of getting caught or anything other than Mr. Evans and his sinfully soft-looking lips and the light scratch of his beard passing through. Your entire body felt like it was on fire, the skin scorching hot to the touch.</p><p>He smiles furtively, almost to himself, his eyes half-hooded with desire as his hand rests on your jaw, tugging you gently to him.</p><p>\u201cYou look so pretty when you blush,\u201d he whispers hotly against your lips.\u00a0</p><p>You barely register the words before his mouth descends upon yours, hot and soft.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take you very long to snap your eyes shut and let your body respond as it wanted to his kiss, melting into him instinctively.</p><p>His lips are plump and soft against yours and the feeling is so overwhelming you can\u2019t help but sigh slightly into his mouth.\u00a0</p><p>He tastes like cinnamon. You remembered him mentioning been Big Red was his favorite gum.</p><p>You grin into the kiss.</p><p>No longer attempting to restrain yourself, you allow a small moan to escape your lips as he moves about your mouth expertly but all the same softly.\u00a0</p><p>He kisses you slowly, taking his time to explore your lips first with his own. His lips tortured you with slow, seductive, wet strokes that had our head spinning and your stomach doing flips Olympic gymnasts would be jealous of.\u00a0</p><p>You respond by moving your own lips in sync with his, desperate to feel him like this.\u00a0</p><p>His fingers dig into your hair as the tip of his tongue slowly swiped at the seam of your lips. You groan softly, parting your lips slightly.</p><p>Immediately, he tugs your face closer to his, tilting his head so he has better access to your mouth and moving his lips a bit more aggressively than before.</p><p>The whole tempo of the kiss completely shifts as overwhelming desire takes over both of you. His tongue, warm and wet makes its way into your mouth, intertwining with yours sensually slow and teasing you.</p><p>He swallows your shallow moans with his mouth as your hands act with a mind of their own and hike up to his hair, tugging at the soft thick dirty blonde locks.</p><p>He parts a centimeter away from you just to growl lowly under his breath, before dipping eagerly down to kiss you again, tugging you so impossibly closer to him, he almost completely pulls you over the console of the car seperating you lower halves.</p><p>You respond with the immense amount of passion weighing down on the pit of your stomach and running your hands all over him. His hair, his neck, his chest. Your hands attach to any part of him you can get your them at, which wasn\u2019t a lot because of the stupid console.</p><p>You nibble on his bottom lip and tug at it gently.</p><p>He groans softly into your mouth and attacks your mouth with even more ferocity than before, his warm long fingers slipping under your shirt and caressing the skin of your hip roughly. You do the same and try to show him just how much you wanted this.\u00a0</p><p>A deep, boiling-hot white fire ignites in the pit of your stomach and you shift slightly on your seat as it presses against your core.\u00a0</p><p>He makes sure to show you just who was in charge here, completely taking over the kiss and claiming your mouth with such fervor, you almost couldn\u2019t believe the same seemingly mild-mannered Mr. Evans you knew and absolutely loved was the one kissing you.</p><p>You break away after a while of having the most mind-numbing kiss and rest your foreheads on eachother.</p><p>Your warm breaths mingle and you feel like you\u2019re coming down from a high.\u00a0</p><p>Wow. Just&hellip;wow. Is this what you\u2019ve been missing out on?\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0His warm panting hits you in the face and makes you want to kiss those delicious lips all over again. \u201c<i>Fuck</i>,\u201d he almost whines. \u201cYou taste just as sweet as I imagined sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Imagined? Imagined?! He <i>imagined </i>this?!</p><p>His rasp is enough to make your core tingle as you bite your lip and look up at him innocently, flushed. \u201cIt must be my chapstick.\u201d</p><p><i>Wow. Is that really all you can say Y/n? </i>You mentally facepalm.\u00a0</p><p>To be fair though, your brain wasn\u2019t working all that well though. You were numb with shock. Every inch of your skin was still cooling down from that sensational kiss.<i>\u00a0</i></p><p>He chuckles sexily, biting his lip and playing with yours. His thumb tugs at the soft, pink muscle as his eyes follow the action.</p><p>\u201cWhat flavor is it?\u201d</p><p>You gulp thickly, completely in shock. \u201cCherry.\u201d</p><p>He licks his own lips and smirks, gazing into your eyes. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know what else to say, so you both fall into a deep silence, looking at one another in a brand new light.\u00a0</p><p>You try to wrap your head around what had just occurred. You just kissed Mr. Evans. And he kissed you back. And he said you tasted sweet and-oh, my God!\u00a0</p><p>Your eyes bulge out of your head.\u00a0</p><p>You kissed your teacher.\u00a0</p><p>You kissed Mr. Evans.</p><p>And he kissed you back, but that is <i>so</i> not the point.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s your teacher and you\u2019re his student, And what-\u00a0</p><p>You look around frantically, the realization of what you\u2019d just done dawning on you. The gravity of it hits you like a truck right in the face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You snap your head towards his and gulp, eyes damp with unspent tears and full with fear.\u00a0\u201cWhat if someone saw us?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His face falls and he sighs defeatedly.\u00a0\u201cNo one saw us, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You exhale deeply and fall against the plush seats, avoiding his gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat did we just do?\u201d you breathe.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0</p><p>Sensing his own realization hitting him, you decide to leave him to his own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go.\u201d You pull the handle of his car and jump out.\u00a0</p><p>You slam it close and don\u2019t look back even once as you walk away on trembling legs.

His arms were still securely wrapped around your waist and yours around his neck. Your breath mixed with eachother and you\u2019re suddenly afraid to so much as sniffle.</p><p>The moment was heart-stoppingly intimate. Like no other kiss could ever even dream of being.\u00a0</p><p>Something about having your heart and not your body laid bare was somehow worse. You were vulnerable and he was right there to support you. It only proved what you thought of him right. He was one of the kindest people you\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Your chest burns with an overwhelming emotion too strong and consuming for you to even <i>attempt </i>to decipher.</p><p>Swallowing hard, you look at him through your slightly wet lashes. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn to do that?\u201d</p><p>Try as you might, the small strain in your voice still makes it through and so God help you, Mr. Evans can clearly see how nervous he makes you.</p><p>In comparison to you, he seems completely confident and comfortable. He makes you feel tiny in all ways possible.\u00a0</p><p>He smiles almost adoringly down at you and you wonder if he realizes that you\u2019re so close your noses are brushing.</p><p>His voice is husky when he speaks and you realize maybe he\u2019s not as cool as he\u2019s trying to seem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI read it helped if someone you trust did it.\u201d His gaze flickers up from your lips to your eyes and a shiver travels through you at the weight of his gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it\u2019d work but I panicked.\u201d</p><p>Your gaze snaps right back to his lips and the air crackles with electricity. Subconsciously, you wet your lips, your throat feeling dry.</p><p>\u201cT-thank you.\u201d</p><p>His thumb casually draws light circles on your hip and your lips part slightly at the sensation. His gaze is soft as a leftover tear makes its way out of your eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>His other thumb softly brushes the tear away and you barely hold back a gasp at his sudden feather-like touch. His eyes seem just as glued to your face as yours to his.</p><p>The atmosphere had completely shifted as you both realize how close you are and how impossible it seemed to move from the other. It was almost magnetic, the pull between you. So strong and\u2026.you can\u2019t possibly look away from his eyes. Not that you want to either way.</p><p>Your heart is beating so fast in your chest, you think it\u2019s a miracle it wasn\u2019t lodged in your throat right now.</p><p>You gulp, tightening your hold on his neck as your head grows fainter and fainter the longer you stare into those intoxicating blue irises.</p><p>So deep. So\u2026beautiful.</p><p>Eventually, you begin leaning in closer to him, drawn by an inexplicable force. His breath hitches when your slight movement causes your chest to press into his further.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so fucking firm</i>. You barely hold back the raggedy moan making its way up your throat. You could easily feel every firm curve made purely of muscle and it was setting your skin aflame.</p><p>His warm breath sent tingles all over your body, the delicious cinnamon scent not aiding your aching soul in the least. Your lips were only a few inches apart.\u00a0</p><p>His lips, so pink and full and kissable\u2026</p><p>Your gaze flickers to his and you look at him from under you lashes heatedly, convinced he could feel just how hard you were breathing.</p><p>The tension between you was so great, you felt almost as if you were being suffocated by the mere pressure of it.</p><p>In response, his gaze grazes every inch of your face shamelessly. It was almost as if he wanted to drink your features in. Soak them into his memory to keep forever.</p><p>\u00a0He eyes that small birthmark and the corner of his lips curls affectionately. He does this for your nose and your brows and your cheeks and your lips where he takes a few extra seconds to fully admire them, taking in every bump and area of soft pink skin, and you wonder if he can see its desperately yelling of it\u2019s want for his own irresistible lips.\u00a0</p><p>You follow his gaze and watch in fascination as the baby blue irises darken to a deep aqua blue right before your eyes and his pupils dilate almost completely. His breathing was hard too, and it made you wonder- hope- that maybe he was as affected by you as you by him.</p><p>His soft hand cups your face and his other one continues to draw circles onto your clothed hip, almost drawing another shuddering breath from you.</p><p>He breathes, \u201care you okay?\u201d</p><p>You have to swallow the huge lump in your throat as his warmth seeps into your skin, but manage to rasp a somewhat coherent sentence through all the want coursing through your system.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You?\u201d</p><p>He smiles adoringly, looking deep into your eyes. \u201cI\u2019m more than okay.\u201d</p><p>When he speaks- and you swear to everything good you tried to ignore how good the tingles it ignites in you made you feel- his lips brush against yours and you finally realize just how easy it\u2019d be to just\u2026kiss him. Right here right now.</p><p>Oh Gosh! But this-this was so wrong. So, so wrong. Like, soooo wrong. He was your teacher. He-he was far older than you and you were just\u2026you.

His arms were still securely wrapped around your waist and yours around his neck. Your breath mixed with eachother and you\u2019re suddenly afraid to so much as sniffle.</p><p>The moment was heart-stoppingly intimate. Like no other kiss could ever even dream of being.\u00a0</p><p>Something about having your heart and not your body laid bare was somehow worse. You were vulnerable and he was right there to support you. It only proved what you thought of him right. He was one of the kindest people you\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Your chest burns with an overwhelming emotion too strong and consuming for you to even <i>attempt </i>to decipher.</p><p>Swallowing hard, you look at him through your slightly wet lashes. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn to do that?\u201d</p><p>Try as you might, the small strain in your voice still makes it through and so God help you, Mr. Evans can clearly see how nervous he makes you.</p><p>In comparison to you, he seems completely confident and comfortable. He makes you feel tiny in all ways possible.\u00a0</p><p>He smiles almost adoringly down at you and you wonder if he realizes that you\u2019re so close your noses are brushing.</p><p>His voice is husky when he speaks and you realize maybe he\u2019s not as cool as he\u2019s trying to seem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI read it helped if someone you trust did it.\u201d His gaze flickers up from your lips to your eyes and a shiver travels through you at the weight of his gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it\u2019d work but I panicked.\u201d</p><p>Your gaze snaps right back to his lips and the air crackles with electricity. Subconsciously, you wet your lips, your throat feeling dry.</p><p>\u201cT-thank you.\u201d</p><p>His thumb casually draws light circles on your hip and your lips part slightly at the sensation. His gaze is soft as a leftover tear makes its way out of your eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>His other thumb softly brushes the tear away and you barely hold back a gasp at his sudden feather-like touch. His eyes seem just as glued to your face as yours to his.</p><p>The atmosphere had completely shifted as you both realize how close you are and how impossible it seemed to move from the other. It was almost magnetic, the pull between you. So strong and\u2026.you can\u2019t possibly look away from his eyes. Not that you want to either way.</p><p>Your heart is beating so fast in your chest, you think it\u2019s a miracle it wasn\u2019t lodged in your throat right now.</p><p>You gulp, tightening your hold on his neck as your head grows fainter and fainter the longer you stare into those intoxicating blue irises.</p><p>So deep. So\u2026beautiful.</p><p>Eventually, you begin leaning in closer to him, drawn by an inexplicable force. His breath hitches when your slight movement causes your chest to press into his further.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so fucking firm</i>. You barely hold back the raggedy moan making its way up your throat. You could easily feel every firm curve made purely of muscle and it was setting your skin aflame.</p><p>His warm breath sent tingles all over your body, the delicious cinnamon scent not aiding your aching soul in the least. Your lips were only a few inches apart.\u00a0</p><p>His lips, so pink and full and kissable\u2026</p><p>Your gaze flickers to his and you look at him from under you lashes heatedly, convinced he could feel just how hard you were breathing.</p><p>The tension between you was so great, you felt almost as if you were being suffocated by the mere pressure of it.</p><p>In response, his gaze grazes every inch of your face shamelessly. It was almost as if he wanted to drink your features in. Soak them into his memory to keep forever.</p><p>\u00a0He eyes that small birthmark and the corner of his lips curls affectionately. He does this for your nose and your brows and your cheeks and your lips where he takes a few extra seconds to fully admire them, taking in every bump and area of soft pink skin, and you wonder if he can see its desperately yelling of it\u2019s want for his own irresistible lips.\u00a0</p><p>You follow his gaze and watch in fascination as the baby blue irises darken to a deep aqua blue right before your eyes and his pupils dilate almost completely. His breathing was hard too, and it made you wonder- hope- that maybe he was as affected by you as you by him.</p><p>His soft hand cups your face and his other one continues to draw circles onto your clothed hip, almost drawing another shuddering breath from you.</p><p>He breathes, \u201care you okay?\u201d</p><p>You have to swallow the huge lump in your throat as his warmth seeps into your skin, but manage to rasp a somewhat coherent sentence through all the want coursing through your system.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You?\u201d</p><p>He smiles adoringly, looking deep into your eyes. \u201cI\u2019m more than okay.\u201d</p><p>When he speaks- and you swear to everything good you tried to ignore how good the tingles it ignites in you made you feel- his lips brush against yours and you finally realize just how easy it\u2019d be to just\u2026kiss him. Right here right now.</p><p>Oh Gosh! But this-this was so wrong. So, so wrong. Like, soooo wrong. He was your teacher. He-he was far older than you and you were just\u2026you. Plain old, boring, embarrassingly inexperienced Y/n.</p><p>And yet\u2026.you couldn\u2019t find it in you to give a single damn. Not right now, in this very moment with both of you so willing to disregard everything and everyone telling you no.\u00a0</p><p>And maybe that was what was really wrong. Maybe the fact that his touch is enough to wash any trace of reason or rationalization from your brain and turn you into utter mush is dangerous and forbidden.</p><p>But you\u2019ve wanted this for so damn long. You\u2019ve literally <i>dreamt </i>of this moment. Countless nights spent wondering what his lips would feel against yours and finally\u2026the opportunity was here. And you were so damn ready.\u00a0</p><p>The tender brushing of his fingers had made your skin hyperaware in a way you had no idea even existed. Every nerve in you stands at attention, magnifying the heavenly sensation of the pads of his fingers brushing your slightly damp skin even more.\u00a0</p><p>He breathes out shakily and leans in closer to you, tilting his head to the side slightly. Your breath hitches and all the while, his fingers trail torturously slow up to your hair and his fingertips dance teasing over your skin as he brushes strands stuck to your temples away, tucking it behind your ear.</p><p>His gaze is so dark now, you barely recognize his eyes, the glistening blue irises almost completely gone and replaced with a dark, almost feral look filled with want equally as much as adoration.</p><p>You hold your breath as your heart pounds harshly against your ribcage. Your brain completely blank. Not a single thought on how wrong this was or the possibility of getting caught or anything other than Mr. Evans and his sinfully soft-looking lips and the light scratch of his beard passing through. Your entire body felt like it was on fire, the skin scorching hot to the touch.</p><p>He smiles furtively, almost to himself, his eyes half-hooded with desire as his hand rests on your jaw, tugging you gently to him.</p><p>\u201cYou look so pretty when you blush,\u201d he whispers hotly against your lips.\u00a0</p><p>You barely register the words before his mouth descends upon yours, hot and soft.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take you very long to snap your eyes shut and let your body respond as it wanted to his kiss, melting into him instinctively.</p><p>His lips are plump and soft against yours and the feeling is so overwhelming you can\u2019t help but sigh slightly into his mouth.\u00a0</p><p>He tastes like cinnamon. You remembered him mentioning been Big Red was his favorite gum.</p><p>You grin into the kiss.</p><p>No longer attempting to restrain yourself, you allow a small moan to escape your lips as he moves about your mouth expertly but all the same softly.\u00a0</p><p>He kisses you slowly, taking his time to explore your lips first with his own. His lips tortured you with slow, seductive, wet strokes that had our head spinning and your stomach doing flips Olympic gymnasts would be jealous of.\u00a0</p><p>You respond by moving your own lips in sync with his, desperate to feel him like this.\u00a0</p><p>His fingers dig into your hair as the tip of his tongue slowly swiped at the seam of your lips. You groan softly, parting your lips slightly.</p><p>Immediately, he tugs your face closer to his, tilting his head so he has better access to your mouth and moving his lips a bit more aggressively than before.</p><p>The whole tempo of the kiss completely shifts as overwhelming desire takes over both of you. His tongue, warm and wet makes its way into your mouth, intertwining with yours sensually slow and teasing you.</p><p>He swallows your shallow moans with his mouth as your hands act with a mind of their own and hike up to his hair, tugging at the soft thick dirty blonde locks.</p><p>He parts a centimeter away from you just to growl lowly under his breath, before dipping eagerly down to kiss you again, tugging you so impossibly closer to him, he almost completely pulls you over the console of the car seperating you lower halves.</p><p>You respond with the immense amount of passion weighing down on the pit of your stomach and running your hands all over him. His hair, his neck, his chest. Your hands attach to any part of him you can get your them at, which wasn\u2019t a lot because of the stupid console.</p><p>You nibble on his bottom lip and tug at it gently.</p><p>He groans softly into your mouth and attacks your mouth with even more ferocity than before, his warm long fingers slipping under your shirt and caressing the skin of your hip roughly. You do the same and try to show him just how much you wanted this.\u00a0</p><p>A deep, boiling-hot white fire ignites in the pit of your stomach and you shift slightly on your seat as it presses against your core.\u00a0</p><p>He makes sure to show you just who was in charge here, completely taking over the kiss and claiming your mouth with such fervor, you almost couldn\u2019t believe the same seemingly mild-mannered Mr. Evans you knew and absolutely loved was the one kissing you.</p><p>You break away after a while of having the most mind-numbing kiss and rest your foreheads on eachother.</p><p>Your warm breaths mingle and you feel like you\u2019re coming down from a high.\u00a0</p><p>Wow. Just\u2026wow. Is this what you\u2019ve been missing out on?\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0His warm panting hits you in the face and makes you want to kiss those delicious lips all over again. \u201c<i>Fuck</i>,\u201d he almost whines. \u201cYou taste just as sweet as I imagined sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Imagined? Imagined?! He <i>imagined </i>this?!</p><p>His rasp is enough to make your core tingle as you bite your lip and look up at him innocently, flushed. \u201cIt must be my chapstick.\u201d</p><p><i>Wow. Is that really all you can say Y/n? </i>You mentally facepalm.\u00a0</p><p>To be fair though, your brain wasn\u2019t working all that well though. You were numb with shock. Every inch of your skin was still cooling down from that sensational kiss.<i>\u00a0</i></p><p>He chuckles sexily, biting his lip and playing with yours. His thumb tugs at the soft, pink muscle as his eyes follow the action.</p><p>\u201cWhat flavor is it?\u201d</p><p>You gulp thickly, completely in shock. \u201cCherry.\u201d</p><p>He licks his own lips and smirks, gazing into your eyes. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know what else to say, so you both fall into a deep silence, looking at one another in a brand new light.\u00a0</p><p>You try to wrap your head around what had just occurred. You just kissed Mr. Evans. And he kissed you back.

His arms were still securely wrapped around your waist and yours around his neck. Your breath mixed with eachother and you&rsquo;re suddenly afraid to so much as sniffle.</p><p>The moment was heart-stoppingly intimate. Like no other kiss could ever even dream of being.&nbsp;</p><p>Something about having your heart and not your body laid bare was somehow worse. You were vulnerable and he was right there to support you. It only proved what you thought of him right. He was one of the kindest people you&rsquo;d ever met.</p><p>Your chest burns with an overwhelming emotion too strong and consuming for you to even <i>attempt </i>to decipher.</p><p>Swallowing hard, you look at him through your slightly wet lashes. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you learn to do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Try as you might, the small strain in your voice still makes it through and so God help you, Mr. Evans can clearly see how nervous he makes you.</p><p>In comparison to you, he seems completely confident and comfortable. He makes you feel tiny in all ways possible.&nbsp;</p><p>He smiles almost adoringly down at you and you wonder if he realizes that you&rsquo;re so close your noses are brushing.</p><p>His voice is husky when he speaks and you realize maybe he&rsquo;s not as cool as he&rsquo;s trying to seem.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I read it helped if someone you trust did it.&rdquo; His gaze flickers up from your lips to your eyes and a shiver travels through you at the weight of his gaze. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;d work but I panicked.&rdquo;</p><p>Your gaze snaps right back to his lips and the air crackles with electricity. Subconsciously, you wet your lips, your throat feeling dry.</p><p>&ldquo;T-thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>His thumb casually draws light circles on your hip and your lips part slightly at the sensation. His gaze is soft as a leftover tear makes its way out of your eye.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, sweetheart.&rdquo;</p><p>His other thumb softly brushes the tear away and you barely hold back a gasp at his sudden feather-like touch. His eyes seem just as glued to your face as yours to his.</p><p>The atmosphere had completely shifted as you both realize how close you are and how impossible it seemed to move from the other. It was almost magnetic, the pull between you. So strong and&hellip;.you can&rsquo;t possibly look away from his eyes. Not that you want to either way.</p><p>Your heart is beating so fast in your chest, you think it&rsquo;s a miracle it wasn&rsquo;t lodged in your throat right now.</p><p>You gulp, tightening your hold on his neck as your head grows fainter and fainter the longer you stare into those intoxicating blue irises.</p><p>So deep. So&hellip;beautiful.</p><p>Eventually, you begin leaning in closer to him, drawn by an inexplicable force. His breath hitches when your slight movement causes your chest to press into his further.</p><p><i>He&rsquo;s so fucking firm</i>. You barely hold back the raggedy moan making its way up your throat. You could easily feel every firm curve made purely of muscle and it was setting your skin aflame.</p><p>His warm breath sent tingles all over your body, the delicious cinnamon scent not aiding your aching soul in the least. Your lips were only a few inches apart.&nbsp;</p><p>His lips, so pink and full and kissable&hellip;</p><p>Your gaze flickers to his and you look at him from under you lashes heatedly, convinced he could feel just how hard you were breathing.</p><p>The tension between you was so great, you felt almost as if you were being suffocated by the mere pressure of it.</p><p>In response, his gaze grazes every inch of your face shamelessly. It was almost as if he wanted to drink your features in. Soak them into his memory to keep forever.</p><p>&nbsp;He eyes that small birthmark and the corner of his lips curls affectionately. He does this for your nose and your brows and your cheeks and your lips where he takes a few extra seconds to fully admire them, taking in every bump and area of soft pink skin, and you wonder if he can see its desperately yelling of it&rsquo;s want for his own irresistible lips.&nbsp;</p><p>You follow his gaze and watch in fascination as the baby blue irises darken to a deep aqua blue right before your eyes and his pupils dilate almost completely. His breathing was hard too, and it made you wonder- hope- that maybe he was as affected by you as you by him.</p><p>His soft hand cups your face and his other one continues to draw circles onto your clothed hip, almost drawing another shuddering breath from you.</p><p>He breathes, &ldquo;are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>You have to swallow the huge lump in your throat as his warmth seeps into your skin, but manage to rasp a somewhat coherent sentence through all the want coursing through your system.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. You?&rdquo;</p><p>He smiles adoringly, looking deep into your eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more than okay.&rdquo;</p><p>When he speaks- and you swear to everything good you tried to ignore how good the tingles it ignites in you made you feel- his lips brush against yours and you finally realize just how easy it&rsquo;d be to just&hellip;kiss him. Right here right now.</p><p>Oh Gosh! But this-this was so wrong. So, so wrong. Like, soooo wrong. He was your teacher. He-he was far older than you and you were just&hellip;you. Plain old, boring, embarrassingly inexperienced Y/n.</p><p>And yet&hellip;.you couldn&rsquo;t find it in you to give a single damn. Not right now, in this very moment with both of you so willing to disregard everything and everyone telling you no.&nbsp;</p><p>And maybe that was what was really wrong. Maybe the fact that his touch is enough to wash any trace of reason or rationalization from your brain and turn you into utter mush is dangerous and forbidden.</p><p>But you&rsquo;ve wanted this for so damn long. You&rsquo;ve literally <i>dreamt </i>of this moment. Countless nights spent wondering what his lips would feel against yours and finally&hellip;the opportunity was here. And you were so damn ready.&nbsp;</p><p>The tender brushing of his fingers had made your skin hyperaware in a way you had no idea even existed. Every nerve in you stands at attention, magnifying the heavenly sensation of the pads of his fingers brushing your slightly damp skin even more.&nbsp;</p><p>He breathes out shakily and leans in closer to you, tilting his head to the side slightly. Your breath hitches and all the while, his fingers trail torturously slow up to your hair and his fingertips dance teasing over your skin as he brushes strands stuck to your temples away, tucking it behind your ear.</p><p>His gaze is so dark now, you barely recognize his eyes, the glistening blue irises almost completely gone and replaced with a dark, almost feral look filled with want equally as much as adoration.</p><p>You hold your breath as your heart pounds harshly against your ribcage. Your brain completely blank. Not a single thought on how wrong this was or the possibility of getting caught or anything other than Mr. Evans and his sinfully soft-looking lips and the light scratch of his beard passing through. Your entire body felt like it was on fire, the skin scorching hot to the touch.</p><p>He smiles furtively, almost to himself, his eyes half-hooded with desire as his hand rests on your jaw, tugging you gently to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You look so pretty when you blush,&rdquo; he whispers hotly against your lips.&nbsp;</p><p>You barely register the words before his mouth descends upon yours, hot and soft.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take you very long to snap your eyes shut and let your body respond as it wanted to his kiss, melting into him instinctively.</p><p>His lips are plump and soft against yours and the feeling is so overwhelming you can&rsquo;t help but sigh slightly into his mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>He tastes like cinnamon. You remembered him mentioning been Big Red was his favorite gum.</p><p>You grin into the kiss.</p><p>No longer attempting to restrain yourself, you allow a small moan to escape your lips as he moves about your mouth expertly but all the same softly.&nbsp;</p><p>He kisses you slowly, taking his time to explore your lips first with his own. His lips tortured you with slow, seductive, wet strokes that had our head spinning and your stomach doing flips Olympic gymnasts would be jealous of.&nbsp;</p><p>You respond by moving your own lips in sync with his, desperate to feel him like this.&nbsp;</p><p>His fingers dig into your hair as the tip of his tongue slowly swiped at the seam of your lips. You groan softly, parting your lips slightly.</p><p>Immediately, he tugs your face closer to his, tilting his head so he has better access to your mouth and moving his lips a bit more aggressively than before.</p><p>The whole tempo of the kiss completely shifts as overwhelming desire takes over both of you. His tongue, warm and wet makes its way into your mouth, intertwining with yours sensually slow and teasing you.</p><p>He swallows your shallow moans with his mouth as your hands act with a mind of their own and hike up to his hair, tugging at the soft thick dirty blonde locks.</p><p>He parts a centimeter away from you just to growl lowly under his breath, before dipping eagerly down to kiss you again, tugging you so impossibly closer to him, he almost completely pulls you over the console of the car seperating you lower halves.</p><p>You respond with the immense amount of passion weighing down on the pit of your stomach and running your hands all over him. His hair, his neck, his chest. Your hands attach to any part of him you can get your them at, which wasn&rsquo;t a lot because of the stupid console.</p><p>You nibble on his bottom lip and tug at it gently.</p><p>He groans softly into your mouth and attacks your mouth with even more ferocity than before, his warm long fingers slipping under your shirt and caressing the skin of your hip roughly. You do the same and try to show him just how much you wanted this.&nbsp;</p><p>A deep, boiling-hot white fire ignites in the pit of your stomach and you shift slightly on your seat as it presses against your core.&nbsp;</p><p>He makes sure to show you just who was in charge here, completely taking over the kiss and claiming your mouth with such fervor, you almost couldn&rsquo;t believe the same seemingly mild-mannered Mr. Evans you knew and absolutely loved was the one kissing you.</p><p>You break away after a while of having the most mind-numbing kiss and rest your foreheads on eachother.</p><p>Your warm breaths mingle and you feel like you&rsquo;re coming down from a high.&nbsp;</p><p>Wow. Just&hellip;wow. Is this what you&rsquo;ve been missing out on?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;His warm panting hits you in the face and makes you want to kiss those delicious lips all over again. &ldquo;<i>Fuck</i>,&rdquo; he almost whines. &ldquo;You taste just as sweet as I imagined sweetheart.&rdquo;</p><p>Imagined? Imagined?! He <i>imagined </i>this?!</p><p>His rasp is enough to make your core tingle as you bite your lip and look up at him innocently, flushed. &ldquo;It must be my chapstick.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Wow. Is that really all you can say Y/n? </i>You mentally facepalm.&nbsp;</p><p>To be fair though, your brain wasn&rsquo;t working all that well though. You were numb with shock. Every inch of your skin was still cooling down from that sensational kiss.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>He chuckles sexily, biting his lip and playing with yours. His thumb tugs at the soft, pink muscle as his eyes follow the action.</p><p>&ldquo;What flavor is it?&rdquo;</p><p>You gulp thickly, completely in shock. &ldquo;Cherry.&rdquo;</p><p>He licks his own lips and smirks, gazing into your eyes. &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t know what else to say, so you both fall into a deep silence, looking at one another in a brand new light.&nbsp;</p><p>You try to wrap your head around what had just occurred. You just kissed Mr. Evans. And he kissed you back. And he said you tasted sweet and-oh, my God!&nbsp;</p><p>Your eyes bulge out of your head.&nbsp;</p><p>You kissed your teacher.&nbsp;</p><p>You kissed Mr. Evans.</p><p>And he kissed you back, but that is <i>so</i> not the point.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s your teacher and you&rsquo;re his student, And what-&nbsp;</p><p>You look around frantically, the realization of what you&rsquo;d just done dawning on you. The gravity of it hits you like a truck right in the face.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You snap your head towards his and gulp, eyes damp with unspent tears and full with fear.&nbsp;&ldquo;What if someone saw us?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>His face falls and he sighs defeatedly.&nbsp;&ldquo;No one saw us, sweetheart.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You exhale deeply and fall against the plush seats, avoiding his gaze.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What did we just do?&rdquo; you breathe.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp;</p><p>Sensing his own realization hitting him, you decide to leave him to his own thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go.&rdquo; You pull the handle of his car and jump out.&nbsp;</p><p>You slam it close and don&rsquo;t look back even once as you walk away on trembling legs.
