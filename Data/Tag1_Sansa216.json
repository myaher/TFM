        "body": "<p>A little bit ago I made a post about Game of Thrones\nparallels and how parallels could be interpreted and read in multiple ways. I\nposited that while it is fun to make predictions based on parallels, it is\nsilly to insist that your reading is the ONLY CORRECT reading so long as we\ndon\u2019t have the ending of the show. Because without the ending, it is unclear\nwhat the show has been building to/going for. Until we have the ending, there\nare many readings we could give the parallels. And I\u2019ma go through some of them\ntoday.</p><p>Please note that I am going to attempt to be completely\nneutral in these readings. Even though I, of course, have stuff that I want to\nhappen/don\u2019t want to happen, I am still going to give every set of parallels a\nfair shake. Then you can decide for yourself which one you like best. Also, an\nimportant note, I am ONLY going to investigate show parallels. I know there\u2019s a\nlot more stuff in the books but if a part from the book didn\u2019t make it into the\nshow, I\u2019m going to assume it won\u2019t influence the show\u2019s ending. With that, I\u2019m\ngoing to start with the most controversial character of the show: Daenerys.</p><p>In my mind, there are three readings of Daenerys character\ngoing around the fandom right now:</p><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is a hero and is going to end up ruling the\nseven kingdoms after saving them from the white walkers. This ending usually\ninvolves her marrying Jon Snow and having a family.</p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is a hero, but will ultimately die in some\nway, never quite making it to the throne. Some theories have her dying in child\nbirth, and others have her dying in a heroic fashion. Either way, in this\ntheory, she chooses heroism over her own ambition.</p><p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is an antagonist who has been going darker\nwith each passing season and in this season she will choose ambition over the\nrealms and become as much a danger as the white walkers.</p><p>So this is a sort of positive, bittersweet and negative\nreading of Daenerys\u2019 arc and trajectory. I\u2019m going to focus on her in each of\nthese arcs. Obviously, shipping stuff is going to come up as it is often tied\nto these parallel reads, but I\u2019ll try to keep it focused on her. But I do think\nI should emphasize that I don\u2019t have a bone in this shipping battle. I\u2019m not\nhardcore for Jonsa or Jonerys. This is an objective as possible, non-shipper\nreading of Dany.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with <b>THEORY\nNUMBER ONE:</b> <b>The positive reading.</b>\n</p><p>This reading revolves around reading Daenerys as a mostly\nmorally good character. Not a character without flaws, of course, but a\ncharacter whose intentions and goals are ultimately just and right. Daenerys\nstarts out in a position of little to no power. This could be paralleled with\nmany other characters in Game of Thrones but, most notably, Sansa. She is not a\nfighter. She is a physically weak princess type. And in some was she\nforeshadows Sansa\u2019s struggles in the later seasons (of being married against\nher will, isolated from her home, becoming disillusioned and learning to find\nher power and stand up for herself). For the purposes of this reading we are\ngoing to call this a positive parallel. We are meant to sympathize equally with\nSansa and Daenerys\u2019 arcs and root for them as they come into their own and\nembrace their name.</p><p>Daenerys can also be paralleled with Jon. As a bastard, he\nhas no claim or ability to inherit anything from his family. As a woman,\nDaenerys\u2019 brother has authority over her. Neither of them are supposed to have\nany strong claim to the throne but by the end, they both seem to be in the best\nposition to take it. But we\u2019ll get more into their relationship later.</p><p>Game of Thrones is full of hard moral choices, and a\npositive reading suggests that Daenerys is another maker of those hard moral\nchoices. When she kills, it is for a variety of reasons. In some cases, she\nkills for vengeance when she burns the witch who killed Khal Drogo and locks\nher betrayers in Quarth. This is parallel to characters like Oberyn Martell and\nRobb Stark (Robb goes to war to get vengeance and justice for his father and\nexpresses how he would like to \u2018kill them all\u2019 when referring to the\nLannisters). This is most parallel of all to Arya Stark, who has been on a\nvengeance train since season 2. Daenerys also kills for justice. After the\nmasters of Mereen crucify several children, she pays them back by crucifying the\nsame number of masters. This treatment could be seen as a parallel to\ncharacters like Ned Stark and Stannis, who are very justice focused. Ned Stark\nwould have beheaded Jorah for selling slaves and has beheaded many men for\nbreaking vows, regardless of circumstances.</p><p>Daenerys has also killed as part of war which many, many\ncharacters have done on all sides of the moral spectrum. Robb Stark sent some\nof his men to their deaths to give them a victory over Jaime Lannister. Stannis\nattacked at the Battle of Blackwater, planning to sack the city which would\nhave led to a whole lot of death. Daenerys does the same and tries to avoid\nattacking civilians. That is not to say she isn\u2019t tempted to attack cities but\nshe can usually be talked down. Her focus is on those who attack her, those who\nviolate the law, and those who take up arms against her. There are times she\nseems to enjoy the rush of killing her enemies because it makes her feel\npowerful, but we\u2019ve seen that in Arya, Sansa, the Hound, Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime\netc.</p><p>Another important character parallel is between Daenerys and\nher father. Her father liked to burn people alive and was, by all accounts, one\nof the most awful kings to have ever ruled. They have some similarities. He was\nalso apparently ambitious and had a lot of high ideals. He did not always\nconsider reality because as a Targaryen he felt himself beyond it. Daenerys\ncertainly embraces her name just as fiercely, and her claim to the throne rests\non the fact that he was the last king. </p><p>However, in this reading we take her at her word: that she\nis not her father. She shows more basic compassion than her father, reaches out\nto the poor and needy, tries not to hurt innocents. She does not burn King\u2019s\nLanding for this reason, while her father was keen to blow the whole place up\nduring his losing war. She also asks her councilors to warn her if they see her\ngoing too far. As Tyrion says \u201cshe knows herself\u201d and wants to improve upon her\nflaws. Sometimes she listens to her advisors and sometimes she doesn\u2019t. This is\nthe same as any king/queen with their councilors. Therefore, because she is\nself aware of her father\u2019s bloody legacy, she is destined to improve on the\npast and be a better ruler than him. She is also attempting to improve on her\nancestor Aegon\u2019s work. He was a conqueror who built the wheel that is the iron\nthrone, but Daenerys has expressed the desire to break the wheel. Maybe this\nwill lead to reforms to improve the monarchy and it\u2019s relationship with the\nseven kingdoms.</p><p>Since many of the other main characters have killed and even\nenjoyed killing, she cannot be placed as darker than any of the rest of them.\nShe is simply one of many morally grey characters on a spectrum. And therefore\na hero of Game of Thrones.</p><p>A hero prioritizes the weak over those in power. A hero\nprioritizes the safety of the people over their own ambition. Most important to\nthis reading is the fact that Daenerys agreed to help Jon Snow whether he bends\nthe knee to her or not. He then, of course, proceeds to bend the knee to her,\nbut she does recognize the necessity of beating the Army of the Dead before\nclaiming her throne. This is foreshadowed in the House of the Undying. Because she\ndid not touch the throne and instead headed the call of her dragons, she proved\nthat she was able to resist ambition when the time called for it. Just like she\nwas rewarded in season 2 (with finding her dragons), she will ultimately be\nrewarded with the throne she worked so hard to claim at the end of season 8. And,\nperhaps, she will break the wheel that is the throne and usher Westeros into a\nbetter future&ndash;probably alongside Jon Snow.</p><p><b>THEORY NUMBER TWO </b>assumes\neverything that I just said about Daenerys being ultimately good. But the\nending is changed. Instead, her not touching the throne symbolizes her final\nsacrifice. That she will save the realms but ultimately she will not have the\nthrone. She had to fully sacrifice her ambition to make Westeros safe again.\nHowever, this is a heroic death, and one that clears the way for future\ngenerations.</p><p>Others, in this tragic death theory, believe she will die in\nchild birth. There has been a lot of strong foreshadowing to suggest Daenerys\nwill have a baby. They kept bringing it up in season 7, after all. And she\nvisually paralleled with Lyanna Stark while having the boat sex with Jon Snow\nwith the \u201cHe loved her and she loved him\u201d line. Lyanna died in child birth and\nRhaegar died in battle, leaving Jon Snow alone. It is possible that a new child\nwill be born and left without parents in the same way. Such is the cost of war.\nThis fits as well with the idea that the ending will be \u201cbittersweet\u201d. It would\nbe bitter sweet to have two major characters die but their child survive.</p><p>Many are also certain Daenerys is going to die because she\nhas been immune to death for so long. All of us knew that she wasn\u2019t dying\nbefore she crossed the narrow sea. George, and the directors, are famous for\nkilling off unexpected characters, so it would be in line with their philosophy\nof \u201cno one is safe\u201d if they killed one of the biggest and most recognizable\ncharacters of the show.</p><p>Now, in reference to theory one and two, we need to talk\nabout Daenerys\u2019 parallels with Jon Snow. They both started out with less power\nand not very much respect. They also (as has been pointed out soooo many times)\nseem to represent ice and fire. Even the climates where they exist represent\nice and fire. Throughout the seasons they both lose their first loves (which\nbegan under circumstances of dubious consent), grow in authority, gain many\nfollowers and allies, have a mystical animal companion, make tough choices that\ncome with ruling, and prove themselves in battle.</p><p>Daenerys faces her most complicated choices in season four\nand five. Same with Jon Snow. They both take up temporary positions of power,\nthat will not be the end goal for their stories (queen of Mereen/Lord\nCommander). At the end of season five, Daenerys is alone in the middle of\nnowhere, surrounded by Dothraki. Jon Snow has been killed. They have fallen\nfrom their position. But they are able to rise up again. By the end of season\nsix, Jon has returned to Winterfell and become King in the North and Daenerys\nhas set out to take her place as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. These parallels\nare meant to show their similarities and foreshadow that they\u2019ve been moving\ntoward each other the whole story. They meet as equals, negotiate as equals,\nand eventually fall for each other as equals. It could be argued that Daenerys\nis putting herself over Jon in this season but he does not allow her to make\nhim feel lesser and their relationship only begins once she puts herself on his\nlevel and his vulnerable with him. And since they\u2019re both Targaryen, the incest\nthing won\u2019t be seen as immoral or out of the ordinary.</p><p>Because they have been so tightly linked, we can predict\nthat in the positive and bitter sweet theories they will either live together\nor die together. In the positive theory, it was meant to be and after so much\nsuffering a struggle, they will earn a happy ending in the end. They compliment\neach other because Jon is more humble and down to earth while Daenerys\npossessed more of the ambition and idealism needed in a leader. They will make\ngood rulers together.</p><p>Or, they have been tragic hero\u2019s from the start and, like\nLyanna and Rhaegar before them, they will not survive the Long Night. But they\nwill bring peace to the realms through their deaths. Lyanna and Rhaegar\u2019s match\ncaused discord and a war in the kingdoms. Their match and sacrifice will bring\nabout peace, which gives us our bitter sweet ending.</p><p>Either way, according to these two theories, when these two\nmajor characters come together in season 7 it is supposed to feel as if two\npeople who have been walking similar journeys are finally uniting with a common\npurpose, bringing the Stark and Targaryen houses together again. They\u2019ve come\nfrom opposite sides of the world, the two last Targaryens, two of the most\nisolated characters in the series, and now they find a place in each other.</p><p>Then there is the very different <b>THEORY THREE: The Dark Daenerys Theory</b></p><p>First off, I think the name Dark! Dany is misleading. It\nimplies that those who subscribe to this theory believe she is evil. Many of\nthem do not. Rather, they see her moving into the role of the antagonist in the\nfinal season of the show. Many people who support this theory ALSO do not hate\nDaenerys, which is important to remember. But for the reasons we are about to\ndiscuss, they prefer her character in the role of the antagonist. This theory\nis not without precedent, and in fact has many parallels that could potentially\nback it up.</p><p>First off, this theory takes a more negative view on\nDaenerys\u2019 parallels with Aegon and Aerys. While the readers of the past few\ntheories believe that she will improve on her ancestors, readers of THIS\ntheory, believe that the cycle is destined to repeat itself. Aegon and Aerys\nwere both visionaries with a high opinion of themselves. Daenerys, like them,\nwill reap destruction on the realms and, like her father, will meet an awful\nend for it. \u201cThe cycle repeats itself\u201d is a very common trope in literature, so\nthis isn\u2019t an unfair reading. The idea of a character trying to avoid their\nfate but tragically falling into it? A classic, and it\u2019s happened to LOTs of\ncharacters on this show. It could certainly happen to Daenerys as well. This\ntheory also takes a more negative view on her parallels to Jon Snow, but we\u2019ll\nget to that in a second.</p><p>So, remember how I said all characters in Game of thrones\nare morally grey to some degree? They don\u2019t all do good shit. But still, many\nof those characters take on the role of protagonist. Arya, Tyrion, Jaime,\nCersei, and Stannis are all morally grey characters who have, at some point,\nbeen in the protagonist seat. Some of them have ALSO been in the antagonist\nseat. So it\u2019s a bit complicated. A lot of people like to compare Daenerys to\nCersei. Certainly there are parallels between them. They have both burned\npeople alive. They are both strong and confident women with a legendary death\nglare. And they have both been victims of a misogynist society. They were both\nmarried off against their will. We can feel sympathy with them because of this.\n</p><p>But Cersei is more often seen in the antagonist role because\nof where she is placed in the narrative. She is fighting characters that WE\nlike. From the very beginning she is set up as an antagonist against the\nStarks. Daenerys on the other hand? She\u2019s the only protagonist in Essos, so all\nof the story content there is told from her perspective. This makes it a bit\nharder to put her actions in perspective (until she comes to Westeros, but we\u2019ll\nget to that later). They are also both ignored for their brothers and are very\neffected by their father\u2019s legacies. They are both trying to succeed their\nfathers. Cersei obviously embraces Tywin\u2019s methods while Daenerys is actively\nworking to avoid becoming her father, but in the eyes of people who subscribe\nto this theory, she has been moving slowly in the direction of Mad King Aerys.</p><p>However, there are some clear differences between Dany and\nCersei. Cersei sort of embraces being a bad person and Dany is genuinely trying\nto do good. She wants to be just. That\u2019s what she strives for. She sees herself\nas a savior. For that reason, I think the best character to parallel with\nDaenerys for this theory is <i>Stannis.</i></p><p>Stannis and Daenerys are extremely similar characters, in\ncircumstance and personality. Both were second in line to the throne, next to\ntheir older brothers. Neither had a good relationship with said brother. Both\nbecame the \u201crightful heir\u201d to the throne one their brother died and they lean\nvery heavily on that fact. They have a lot of similar dialogue claiming the throne\nbelongs to them by right and that they will take what belongs to them. They\nalso are the two characters who execute people by burning. Fire is a very\nimportant element for them. And of course, they are both predicted to be at the\ncenter of the same prophesy. Most importantly they both believe in the\nrighteousness of their cause. They believe they are doing the right thing.</p><p>We don\u2019t yet know the ending of Daenerys\u2019 arc. But we DO\nknow the ending of Stannis\u2019 arc. Though he believes in the good of his cause,\nhas honorable allies to chose him (like Davos), does some good things, and\nfights against people we consider bad&ndash;he goes too far and he falls for it.</p><p>Stannis died because he was willing to sacrifice his\ndaughter for his ambition. He burned a screaming child on a pyre to give him a\nchance against the Boltons, expecting to be rewarded for his noble sacrifice:\nand he failed. He died. All that time spent talking about how he was the\nrightful heir to the throne and it was all for nothing because he went too far.\nHe got too focused on himself as the savior and sacrificed the most important\nthing in his life. This could be foreshadowing for Daenerys (whether she goes\nlight or dark). In order to ever earn the throne, she must be willing to\nsacrifice her ambition. And if in the final season she ever goes too far or\nignores the real threat in favor of her throne, she will be punished in some\nway, just like Stannis was. This isn\u2019t a certainty that she WILL make the wrong\nchoice, but it certainly sets up that she will face a choice.</p><p>See, Game of Thrones is big on the \u2018all actions have\nconsequences\u2019 thing. Robb died for breaking his vow, Ned died because he was\ntoo honorable and foolish in a dishonorable place. Oberyn died because he was\ntoo set on his perfect vengeance. Tywin died because he was a dick to his son.\nStannis died because he burned his daughter alive. And Rickon died because he\ndidn\u2019t run in a zig zag (Too soon? Too soon). Whatever theory you subscribe to,\nI think it\u2019s clear that Daenerys will face a major choice in season 8 that will\nhave major consequences.</p><p>Going back to Stannis for a minute: it is also Stannis who\nshows us the not so great nature of fire. This is the basis for a lot of Dark!\nDany theorists reasoning. Fire has never been portrayed as the good element\nthat fights off the evil ice. It has many times been shown in a negative light.\nStannis burning people for his religion, the wild fire that Tyrion uses on the\nBlackwater and Cersei uses to blow up the sept. Fire and ice have both been\ndestructive forces throughout. One is not better than the other. So people who\nbelieve in this theory see fire and ice not as opposing forces but as two equal\nthreats about to descend on Westeros. This is further backed up by the plot\nstructure of Dany and the white walker\u2019s arrival in Westeros. They\u2019ve been\npresent since season 1 but have only now arrived in Westeros in season 7 (Dany\nat the beginning and the white walkers at the end). </p><p>Likewise, fans of this theory believe that Dany and Jon have\nbeen paralleled not to show them as lost souls who have found each other but to\nset up two opposing forces that will eventually clash. Two Targaryens who are\nrivals for the throne. This theory focuses a lot on the DIFFERENCES between Jon\nand Daenerys. Jon always seems to struggle with killing people, even those who\ndefy him or actively killed him. He hesitates. He appears visibly uncomfortable.\nDaenerys seems to revel in the sight of people burning, especially later on in\nthe series. There\u2019s something satisfied about it. One could easily argue that\nDany is just better at putting on a face than Jon and she is just as disturbed\nby executing people, but if that is the case, the show hasn\u2019t shown it as\nclearly. (Note: this could just as easily be a directing/acting problem).</p><p>It\u2019s also fair to point out that, while lots of people\nsupporting the first theory ship Jonerys, a lot of people supporting this\ntheory support Jonsa. They see Sansa as a better queen than Daenerys. I don\u2019t\nlike to pit female characters against each other, but at the very least, one\ncan say that Sansa is a bit more down to earth because of her many hard earned\nlessons. She thinks more about the practical problems of winter and, as she\nsays to Arya \u201cchopping off people\u2019s heads is satisfying but it\u2019s not a way to\nget them to work together\u201d. Execution is not her first inclination. She only\npulls it after someone has truly revealed themselves to be despicable.\nDaenerys, on the other hand, executes men before knowing if they are guilty or\nnot in season five.</p><p>Regardless, those who believe in this theory tend to focus\non Daenerys\u2019 more sinister acts. Her temper, her desire for vengeance, her fascination\nwith fire. But this does not erase her good deeds either. Trying to end\nslavery, rescuing the weak, locking up her dragons after she finds out that\nthey are causing problems. Again: she\u2019s a grey character. The difference\nbetween the dark vs light Dany theory is that one side believes her darker acts\nare ultimately the most significant to her arc and the light side believes her\ngood acts are ultimately the most significant part of her arc.</p><p>But again, Daenerys, up until now has been pitted against\nnameless faces. So how is she framed when she is put up against characters we\nknow and love? Particularly, long time antagonist house: The Lannisters.</p><p>The attack on the Lannisters is one of the most fascinating\nscenes in the whole show to me. Because put aside the fact that yes, Daenerys\nis attacking soldiers opposing her in war. Put aside the fact that she is\nrefusing to attack innocent civilians. Put aside the fact that many viewers are\nrooting for her and she is way more popular than most of the Lannisters. This\nscene frames Daenerys as the antagonist. </p><p>The camera primarily focuses on three characters: Jaime,\nBronn and Tyrion. We do not follow Daenerys as she sweeps down upon her\nenemies. We follow the Lannisters watching in horror as she arrives. This is\nlike the Huns coming over the ridge in Mulan (no really, it\u2019s introduced almost\nthe exact same way). We zoom in on Jaime and Bronn\u2019s stunned expressions. We\nalso focus on Dickon\u2019s horror as well. The camera lingers on the bodies of\nsoldiers crumbling to ash. It lingers on Tyrion, looking on, astounded by the\nlevel of destruction that can be wrought by the dragon. But he\u2019s seeing the men\nwho serve his family dying. He\u2019s worried for his brother.</p><p>There is no sense of joy in Daenerys\u2019 victory here. We don\u2019t\ncut to her after the battle, feeling satisfied. We cut to Tyrion wandering\nthrough the ashes of Westeros soldiers, looking absolutely devastated. And even\nthough Sam\u2019s dad is a dick, his death alongside his son is still framed in this\nreally gruesome way. Tyrion is the point of view character through all of this.\nWe feel distant from Daenerys in this scene. What is she thinking? What is her\nmotive? But she is separate from the others, which is a classic way to frame a\nvillain in film. </p><p>And her soldiers? They are a faceless threat. We don\u2019t have\nany Dothraki soldiers who we know and love. The show didn\u2019t bother giving any\nof them personalities which could be an error in the writing or something but I\ndon\u2019t know. In the Unsullied, we know Grey worm, and he\u2019s not even in this\nbattle. Contrast this with the scene we got with the Ed Sheeren Lannister\nsoldiers in episode one&ndash;a shockingly nice moment where we see the normal\npeople of Westeros just trying to get through their lives. It\u2019s significant\nthat it forces Arya to recognize some of the Lannisters as human and then they\nprobably got cooked in that battle. We do not get any such conversations with Daenerys\u2019\nsoldiers in this season.</p><p>There are also people who point out Daenerys burning the\nsupplies in this attack&ndash;supplies that would be sorely needed in the winter\ntime. This supports the idea that Daario put forward in a previous episode.\nThat Daenerys is not a ruler made to sit on an iron chair. She is far more\ncomfortable and confident on a dragon. She is a conqueror. And conquerors do\nnot always have the foresight to plan for the future. They sweep in, they\ndestroy, they leave ashes in their wake. One could argue that this was what\nDany did in Essos. She certainly didn\u2019t establish a stable system of government\nin Mereen before she left for the real goal: Westeros. And for all of those\nreasons, those who subscribe to the Dark Dany theory do not think that she\nshould be given the throne as a reward. They think she will die a conqueror,\nunable to give up her ambition for the greater good. She will go too far and\nsuffer the consequences.</p><p>Now, it\u2019s worth mentioning that all three of these theories\nI\u2019ve mentioned have flaws. Those who love Daenerys and want to see her on the\nthrone often ignore her good qualities while those who want to see Dany as an\nantagonist often ignore her bad qualities. The character is often reduced into\na simplistic binary of good vs evil, which is not what this show is about. The \u2018Dany\nwill get the throne\u2019 crowd ignores the idea that the ending of Game of Thrones\nwill be \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cbittersweet\u201d and the fact that George does not like\npredictable happily ever afters. </p><p>Meanwhile those who think Daenerys will go dark assume a\nHUGE amount of intentionality on the parts of the showrunners. They assume any\nlack of chemistry between Jon and Daenerys, any darker expression from\nDaenerys, and the framing of the attack on the Lannisters are intentional\nchoices. Some of this stuff could be errors in directing, writing and acting.\nCertainly, the showrunners have never been perfect. Just look at the dumb as\nhell Arya and Sansa plot that they wrote for season seven. So it\u2019s just as\nlikely that some of this \u201cforeshadowing\u201d is an error that will go\nunacknowledged in the final season.</p><p>Whatever the case, there is room for reasonable doubt and\nthat doubt will only be settled by season 8. It\u2019s going to be controversial no\nmatter what happens, but I wanted to make this post to show the perspective of\nall sides. And, perhaps, to foster courteous discussion. You can start fights\nin the notes if you want, but try to keep it classy. I think it\u2019s great that we\nall love a show so much to do so much analyzing of its content. At this point,\nthere\u2019s enough evidence to support all three theories and none of them are \u201cdelusional\u201d.\nYou may not like some of the theories. They might conflict with your personal\nbeliefs about the show. But there\u2019s not one way this thing could end.</p><p>So, yeah, if you have opinions, let me know. I know that I didn\u2019t get to all of the parallels. Like, I barely brushed the surface. This is meant to be an overview, not a deep dive. But again, keep\nit casual. I\u2019m not going to be fighting with any trolls. Besides, none of you\neven know which side I\u2019m on so you could be starting a fight over nothing!</p><p>I\u2019ll probably be writing one of these on the other main\ncharacters eventually. I might even&ndash;if I\u2019m feeling very bold&ndash;tackle the\nJonerys vs Jonsa debate. Lord help me if I do.</p>",
        "reblog": {
            "comment": "<p>A little bit ago I made a post about Game of Thrones\nparallels and how parallels could be interpreted and read in multiple ways. I\nposited that while it is fun to make predictions based on parallels, it is\nsilly to insist that your reading is the ONLY CORRECT reading so long as we\ndon\u2019t have the ending of the show. Because without the ending, it is unclear\nwhat the show has been building to/going for. Until we have the ending, there\nare many readings we could give the parallels. And I\u2019ma go through some of them\ntoday.</p><p>Please note that I am going to attempt to be completely\nneutral in these readings. Even though I, of course, have stuff that I want to\nhappen/don\u2019t want to happen, I am still going to give every set of parallels a\nfair shake. Then you can decide for yourself which one you like best. Also, an\nimportant note, I am ONLY going to investigate show parallels. I know there\u2019s a\nlot more stuff in the books but if a part from the book didn\u2019t make it into the\nshow, I\u2019m going to assume it won\u2019t influence the show\u2019s ending. With that, I\u2019m\ngoing to start with the most controversial character of the show: Daenerys.</p><p>In my mind, there are three readings of Daenerys character\ngoing around the fandom right now:</p><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is a hero and is going to end up ruling the\nseven kingdoms after saving them from the white walkers. This ending usually\ninvolves her marrying Jon Snow and having a family.</p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is a hero, but will ultimately die in some\nway, never quite making it to the throne. Some theories have her dying in child\nbirth, and others have her dying in a heroic fashion. Either way, in this\ntheory, she chooses heroism over her own ambition.</p><p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is an antagonist who has been going darker\nwith each passing season and in this season she will choose ambition over the\nrealms and become as much a danger as the white walkers.</p><p>So this is a sort of positive, bittersweet and negative\nreading of Daenerys\u2019 arc and trajectory. I\u2019m going to focus on her in each of\nthese arcs. Obviously, shipping stuff is going to come up as it is often tied\nto these parallel reads, but I\u2019ll try to keep it focused on her. But I do think\nI should emphasize that I don\u2019t have a bone in this shipping battle. I\u2019m not\nhardcore for Jonsa or Jonerys. This is an objective as possible, non-shipper\nreading of Dany.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with <b>THEORY\nNUMBER ONE:</b> <b>The positive reading.</b>\n</p><p>This reading revolves around reading Daenerys as a mostly\nmorally good character. Not a character without flaws, of course, but a\ncharacter whose intentions and goals are ultimately just and right. Daenerys\nstarts out in a position of little to no power. This could be paralleled with\nmany other characters in Game of Thrones but, most notably, Sansa. She is not a\nfighter. She is a physically weak princess type. And in some was she\nforeshadows Sansa\u2019s struggles in the later seasons (of being married against\nher will, isolated from her home, becoming disillusioned and learning to find\nher power and stand up for herself). For the purposes of this reading we are\ngoing to call this a positive parallel. We are meant to sympathize equally with\nSansa and Daenerys\u2019 arcs and root for them as they come into their own and\nembrace their name.</p><p>Daenerys can also be paralleled with Jon. As a bastard, he\nhas no claim or ability to inherit anything from his family. As a woman,\nDaenerys\u2019 brother has authority over her. Neither of them are supposed to have\nany strong claim to the throne but by the end, they both seem to be in the best\nposition to take it. But we\u2019ll get more into their relationship later.</p><p>Game of Thrones is full of hard moral choices, and a\npositive reading suggests that Daenerys is another maker of those hard moral\nchoices. When she kills, it is for a variety of reasons. In some cases, she\nkills for vengeance when she burns the witch who killed Khal Drogo and locks\nher betrayers in Quarth. This is parallel to characters like Oberyn Martell and\nRobb Stark (Robb goes to war to get vengeance and justice for his father and\nexpresses how he would like to \u2018kill them all\u2019 when referring to the\nLannisters). This is most parallel of all to Arya Stark, who has been on a\nvengeance train since season 2. Daenerys also kills for justice. After the\nmasters of Mereen crucify several children, she pays them back by crucifying the\nsame number of masters. This treatment could be seen as a parallel to\ncharacters like Ned Stark and Stannis, who are very justice focused. Ned Stark\nwould have beheaded Jorah for selling slaves and has beheaded many men for\nbreaking vows, regardless of circumstances.</p><p>Daenerys has also killed as part of war which many, many\ncharacters have done on all sides of the moral spectrum. Robb Stark sent some\nof his men to their deaths to give them a victory over Jaime Lannister. Stannis\nattacked at the Battle of Blackwater, planning to sack the city which would\nhave led to a whole lot of death. Daenerys does the same and tries to avoid\nattacking civilians. That is not to say she isn\u2019t tempted to attack cities but\nshe can usually be talked down. Her focus is on those who attack her, those who\nviolate the law, and those who take up arms against her. There are times she\nseems to enjoy the rush of killing her enemies because it makes her feel\npowerful, but we\u2019ve seen that in Arya, Sansa, the Hound, Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime\netc.</p><p>Another important character parallel is between Daenerys and\nher father. Her father liked to burn people alive and was, by all accounts, one\nof the most awful kings to have ever ruled. They have some similarities. He was\nalso apparently ambitious and had a lot of high ideals. He did not always\nconsider reality because as a Targaryen he felt himself beyond it. Daenerys\ncertainly embraces her name just as fiercely, and her claim to the throne rests\non the fact that he was the last king. </p><p>However, in this reading we take her at her word: that she\nis not her father. She shows more basic compassion than her father, reaches out\nto the poor and needy, tries not to hurt innocents. She does not burn King\u2019s\nLanding for this reason, while her father was keen to blow the whole place up\nduring his losing war. She also asks her councilors to warn her if they see her\ngoing too far. As Tyrion says \u201cshe knows herself\u201d and wants to improve upon her\nflaws. Sometimes she listens to her advisors and sometimes she doesn\u2019t. This is\nthe same as any king/queen with their councilors. Therefore, because she is\nself aware of her father\u2019s bloody legacy, she is destined to improve on the\npast and be a better ruler than him. She is also attempting to improve on her\nancestor Aegon\u2019s work. He was a conqueror who built the wheel that is the iron\nthrone, but Daenerys has expressed the desire to break the wheel. Maybe this\nwill lead to reforms to improve the monarchy and it\u2019s relationship with the\nseven kingdoms.</p><p>Since many of the other main characters have killed and even\nenjoyed killing, she cannot be placed as darker than any of the rest of them.\nShe is simply one of many morally grey characters on a spectrum. And therefore\na hero of Game of Thrones.</p><p>A hero prioritizes the weak over those in power. A hero\nprioritizes the safety of the people over their own ambition. Most important to\nthis reading is the fact that Daenerys agreed to help Jon Snow whether he bends\nthe knee to her or not. He then, of course, proceeds to bend the knee to her,\nbut she does recognize the necessity of beating the Army of the Dead before\nclaiming her throne. This is foreshadowed in the House of the Undying. Because she\ndid not touch the throne and instead headed the call of her dragons, she proved\nthat she was able to resist ambition when the time called for it. Just like she\nwas rewarded in season 2 (with finding her dragons), she will ultimately be\nrewarded with the throne she worked so hard to claim at the end of season 8. And,\nperhaps, she will break the wheel that is the throne and usher Westeros into a\nbetter future\u2013probably alongside Jon Snow.</p><p><b>THEORY NUMBER TWO </b>assumes\neverything that I just said about Daenerys being ultimately good. But the\nending is changed. Instead, her not touching the throne symbolizes her final\nsacrifice. That she will save the realms but ultimately she will not have the\nthrone. She had to fully sacrifice her ambition to make Westeros safe again.\nHowever, this is a heroic death, and one that clears the way for future\ngenerations.</p><p>Others, in this tragic death theory, believe she will die in\nchild birth. There has been a lot of strong foreshadowing to suggest Daenerys\nwill have a baby. They kept bringing it up in season 7, after all. And she\nvisually paralleled with Lyanna Stark while having the boat sex with Jon Snow\nwith the \u201cHe loved her and she loved him\u201d line. Lyanna died in child birth and\nRhaegar died in battle, leaving Jon Snow alone. It is possible that a new child\nwill be born and left without parents in the same way. Such is the cost of war.\nThis fits as well with the idea that the ending will be \u201cbittersweet\u201d. It would\nbe bitter sweet to have two major characters die but their child survive.</p><p>Many are also certain Daenerys is going to die because she\nhas been immune to death for so long. All of us knew that she wasn\u2019t dying\nbefore she crossed the narrow sea. George, and the directors, are famous for\nkilling off unexpected characters, so it would be in line with their philosophy\nof \u201cno one is safe\u201d if they killed one of the biggest and most recognizable\ncharacters of the show.</p><p>Now, in reference to theory one and two, we need to talk\nabout Daenerys\u2019 parallels with Jon Snow. They both started out with less power\nand not very much respect. They also (as has been pointed out soooo many times)\nseem to represent ice and fire. Even the climates where they exist represent\nice and fire. Throughout the seasons they both lose their first loves (which\nbegan under circumstances of dubious consent), grow in authority, gain many\nfollowers and allies, have a mystical animal companion, make tough choices that\ncome with ruling, and prove themselves in battle.</p><p>Daenerys faces her most complicated choices in season four\nand five. Same with Jon Snow. They both take up temporary positions of power,\nthat will not be the end goal for their stories (queen of Mereen/Lord\nCommander). At the end of season five, Daenerys is alone in the middle of\nnowhere, surrounded by Dothraki. Jon Snow has been killed. They have fallen\nfrom their position. But they are able to rise up again. By the end of season\nsix, Jon has returned to Winterfell and become King in the North and Daenerys\nhas set out to take her place as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. These parallels\nare meant to show their similarities and foreshadow that they\u2019ve been moving\ntoward each other the whole story. They meet as equals, negotiate as equals,\nand eventually fall for each other as equals. It could be argued that Daenerys\nis putting herself over Jon in this season but he does not allow her to make\nhim feel lesser and their relationship only begins once she puts herself on his\nlevel and his vulnerable with him. And since they\u2019re both Targaryen, the incest\nthing won\u2019t be seen as immoral or out of the ordinary.</p><p>Because they have been so tightly linked, we can predict\nthat in the positive and bitter sweet theories they will either live together\nor die together. In the positive theory, it was meant to be and after so much\nsuffering a struggle, they will earn a happy ending in the end. They compliment\neach other because Jon is more humble and down to earth while Daenerys\npossessed more of the ambition and idealism needed in a leader. They will make\ngood rulers together.</p><p>Or, they have been tragic hero\u2019s from the start and, like\nLyanna and Rhaegar before them, they will not survive the Long Night. But they\nwill bring peace to the realms through their deaths. Lyanna and Rhaegar\u2019s match\ncaused discord and a war in the kingdoms. Their match and sacrifice will bring\nabout peace, which gives us our bitter sweet ending.</p><p>Either way, according to these two theories, when these two\nmajor characters come together in season 7 it is supposed to feel as if two\npeople who have been walking similar journeys are finally uniting with a common\npurpose, bringing the Stark and Targaryen houses together again. They\u2019ve come\nfrom opposite sides of the world, the two last Targaryens, two of the most\nisolated characters in the series, and now they find a place in each other.</p><p>Then there is the very different <b>THEORY THREE: The Dark Daenerys Theory</b></p><p>First off, I think the name Dark! Dany is misleading. It\nimplies that those who subscribe to this theory believe she is evil. Many of\nthem do not. Rather, they see her moving into the role of the antagonist in the\nfinal season of the show. Many people who support this theory ALSO do not hate\nDaenerys, which is important to remember. But for the reasons we are about to\ndiscuss, they prefer her character in the role of the antagonist. This theory\nis not without precedent, and in fact has many parallels that could potentially\nback it up.</p><p>First off, this theory takes a more negative view on\nDaenerys\u2019 parallels with Aegon and Aerys. While the readers of the past few\ntheories believe that she will improve on her ancestors, readers of THIS\ntheory, believe that the cycle is destined to repeat itself. Aegon and Aerys\nwere both visionaries with a high opinion of themselves. Daenerys, like them,\nwill reap destruction on the realms and, like her father, will meet an awful\nend for it. \u201cThe cycle repeats itself\u201d is a very common trope in literature, so\nthis isn\u2019t an unfair reading. The idea of a character trying to avoid their\nfate but tragically falling into it? A classic, and it\u2019s happened to LOTs of\ncharacters on this show. It could certainly happen to Daenerys as well. This\ntheory also takes a more negative view on her parallels to Jon Snow, but we\u2019ll\nget to that in a second.</p><p>So, remember how I said all characters in Game of thrones\nare morally grey to some degree? They don\u2019t all do good shit. But still, many\nof those characters take on the role of protagonist. Arya, Tyrion, Jaime,\nCersei, and Stannis are all morally grey characters who have, at some point,\nbeen in the protagonist seat. Some of them have ALSO been in the antagonist\nseat. So it\u2019s a bit complicated. A lot of people like to compare Daenerys to\nCersei. Certainly there are parallels between them. They have both burned\npeople alive. They are both strong and confident women with a legendary death\nglare. And they have both been victims of a misogynist society. They were both\nmarried off against their will. We can feel sympathy with them because of this.\n</p><p>But Cersei is more often seen in the antagonist role because\nof where she is placed in the narrative. She is fighting characters that WE\nlike. From the very beginning she is set up as an antagonist against the\nStarks. Daenerys on the other hand? She\u2019s the only protagonist in Essos, so all\nof the story content there is told from her perspective. This makes it a bit\nharder to put her actions in perspective (until she comes to Westeros, but we\u2019ll\nget to that later). They are also both ignored for their brothers and are very\neffected by their father\u2019s legacies. They are both trying to succeed their\nfathers. Cersei obviously embraces Tywin\u2019s methods while Daenerys is actively\nworking to avoid becoming her father, but in the eyes of people who subscribe\nto this theory, she has been moving slowly in the direction of Mad King Aerys.</p><p>However, there are some clear differences between Dany and\nCersei. Cersei sort of embraces being a bad person and Dany is genuinely trying\nto do good. She wants to be just. That\u2019s what she strives for. She sees herself\nas a savior. For that reason, I think the best character to parallel with\nDaenerys for this theory is <i>Stannis.</i></p><p>Stannis and Daenerys are extremely similar characters, in\ncircumstance and personality. Both were second in line to the throne, next to\ntheir older brothers. Neither had a good relationship with said brother. Both\nbecame the \u201crightful heir\u201d to the throne one their brother died and they lean\nvery heavily on that fact. They have a lot of similar dialogue claiming the throne\nbelongs to them by right and that they will take what belongs to them. They\nalso are the two characters who execute people by burning. Fire is a very\nimportant element for them. And of course, they are both predicted to be at the\ncenter of the same prophesy. Most importantly they both believe in the\nrighteousness of their cause. They believe they are doing the right thing.</p><p>We don\u2019t yet know the ending of Daenerys\u2019 arc. But we DO\nknow the ending of Stannis\u2019 arc. Though he believes in the good of his cause,\nhas honorable allies to chose him (like Davos), does some good things, and\nfights against people we consider bad\u2013he goes too far and he falls for it.</p><p>Stannis died because he was willing to sacrifice his\ndaughter for his ambition. He burned a screaming child on a pyre to give him a\nchance against the Boltons, expecting to be rewarded for his noble sacrifice:\nand he failed. He died. All that time spent talking about how he was the\nrightful heir to the throne and it was all for nothing because he went too far.\nHe got too focused on himself as the savior and sacrificed the most important\nthing in his life. This could be foreshadowing for Daenerys (whether she goes\nlight or dark). In order to ever earn the throne, she must be willing to\nsacrifice her ambition. And if in the final season she ever goes too far or\nignores the real threat in favor of her throne, she will be punished in some\nway, just like Stannis was. This isn\u2019t a certainty that she WILL make the wrong\nchoice, but it certainly sets up that she will face a choice.</p><p>See, Game of Thrones is big on the \u2018all actions have\nconsequences\u2019 thing. Robb died for breaking his vow, Ned died because he was\ntoo honorable and foolish in a dishonorable place. Oberyn died because he was\ntoo set on his perfect vengeance. Tywin died because he was a dick to his son.\nStannis died because he burned his daughter alive. And Rickon died because he\ndidn\u2019t run in a zig zag (Too soon? Too soon). Whatever theory you subscribe to,\nI think it\u2019s clear that Daenerys will face a major choice in season 8 that will\nhave major consequences.</p><p>Going back to Stannis for a minute: it is also Stannis who\nshows us the not so great nature of fire. This is the basis for a lot of Dark!\nDany theorists reasoning. Fire has never been portrayed as the good element\nthat fights off the evil ice. It has many times been shown in a negative light.\nStannis burning people for his religion, the wild fire that Tyrion uses on the\nBlackwater and Cersei uses to blow up the sept. Fire and ice have both been\ndestructive forces throughout. One is not better than the other. So people who\nbelieve in this theory see fire and ice not as opposing forces but as two equal\nthreats about to descend on Westeros. This is further backed up by the plot\nstructure of Dany and the white walker\u2019s arrival in Westeros. They\u2019ve been\npresent since season 1 but have only now arrived in Westeros in season 7 (Dany\nat the beginning and the white walkers at the end). </p><p>Likewise, fans of this theory believe that Dany and Jon have\nbeen paralleled not to show them as lost souls who have found each other but to\nset up two opposing forces that will eventually clash. Two Targaryens who are\nrivals for the throne. This theory focuses a lot on the DIFFERENCES between Jon\nand Daenerys. Jon always seems to struggle with killing people, even those who\ndefy him or actively killed him. He hesitates. He appears visibly uncomfortable.\nDaenerys seems to revel in the sight of people burning, especially later on in\nthe series. There\u2019s something satisfied about it. One could easily argue that\nDany is just better at putting on a face than Jon and she is just as disturbed\nby executing people, but if that is the case, the show hasn\u2019t shown it as\nclearly. (Note: this could just as easily be a directing/acting problem).</p><p>It\u2019s also fair to point out that, while lots of people\nsupporting the first theory ship Jonerys, a lot of people supporting this\ntheory support Jonsa. They see Sansa as a better queen than Daenerys. I don\u2019t\nlike to pit female characters against each other, but at the very least, one\ncan say that Sansa is a bit more down to earth because of her many hard earned\nlessons. She thinks more about the practical problems of winter and, as she\nsays to Arya \u201cchopping off people\u2019s heads is satisfying but it\u2019s not a way to\nget them to work together\u201d. Execution is not her first inclination. She only\npulls it after someone has truly revealed themselves to be despicable.\nDaenerys, on the other hand, executes men before knowing if they are guilty or\nnot in season five.</p><p>Regardless, those who believe in this theory tend to focus\non Daenerys\u2019 more sinister acts. Her temper, her desire for vengeance, her fascination\nwith fire. But this does not erase her good deeds either. Trying to end\nslavery, rescuing the weak, locking up her dragons after she finds out that\nthey are causing problems. Again: she\u2019s a grey character. The difference\nbetween the dark vs light Dany theory is that one side believes her darker acts\nare ultimately the most significant to her arc and the light side believes her\ngood acts are ultimately the most significant part of her arc.</p><p>But again, Daenerys, up until now has been pitted against\nnameless faces. So how is she framed when she is put up against characters we\nknow and love? Particularly, long time antagonist house: The Lannisters.</p><p>The attack on the Lannisters is one of the most fascinating\nscenes in the whole show to me. Because put aside the fact that yes, Daenerys\nis attacking soldiers opposing her in war. Put aside the fact that she is\nrefusing to attack innocent civilians. Put aside the fact that many viewers are\nrooting for her and she is way more popular than most of the Lannisters. This\nscene frames Daenerys as the antagonist. </p><p>The camera primarily focuses on three characters: Jaime,\nBronn and Tyrion. We do not follow Daenerys as she sweeps down upon her\nenemies. We follow the Lannisters watching in horror as she arrives. This is\nlike the Huns coming over the ridge in Mulan (no really, it\u2019s introduced almost\nthe exact same way). We zoom in on Jaime and Bronn\u2019s stunned expressions. We\nalso focus on Dickon\u2019s horror as well. The camera lingers on the bodies of\nsoldiers crumbling to ash. It lingers on Tyrion, looking on, astounded by the\nlevel of destruction that can be wrought by the dragon. But he\u2019s seeing the men\nwho serve his family dying. He\u2019s worried for his brother.</p><p>There is no sense of joy in Daenerys\u2019 victory here. We don\u2019t\ncut to her after the battle, feeling satisfied. We cut to Tyrion wandering\nthrough the ashes of Westeros soldiers, looking absolutely devastated. And even\nthough Sam\u2019s dad is a dick, his death alongside his son is still framed in this\nreally gruesome way. Tyrion is the point of view character through all of this.\nWe feel distant from Daenerys in this scene. What is she thinking? What is her\nmotive? But she is separate from the others, which is a classic way to frame a\nvillain in film. </p><p>And her soldiers? They are a faceless threat. We don\u2019t have\nany Dothraki soldiers who we know and love. The show didn\u2019t bother giving any\nof them personalities which could be an error in the writing or something but I\ndon\u2019t know. In the Unsullied, we know Grey worm, and he\u2019s not even in this\nbattle. Contrast this with the scene we got with the Ed Sheeren Lannister\nsoldiers in episode one\u2013a shockingly nice moment where we see the normal\npeople of Westeros just trying to get through their lives. It\u2019s significant\nthat it forces Arya to recognize some of the Lannisters as human and then they\nprobably got cooked in that battle. We do not get any such conversations with Daenerys\u2019\nsoldiers in this season.</p><p>There are also people who point out Daenerys burning the\nsupplies in this attack\u2013supplies that would be sorely needed in the winter\ntime. This supports the idea that Daario put forward in a previous episode.\nThat Daenerys is not a ruler made to sit on an iron chair. She is far more\ncomfortable and confident on a dragon. She is a conqueror. And conquerors do\nnot always have the foresight to plan for the future. They sweep in, they\ndestroy, they leave ashes in their wake. One could argue that this was what\nDany did in Essos. She certainly didn\u2019t establish a stable system of government\nin Mereen before she left for the real goal: Westeros. And for all of those\nreasons, those who subscribe to the Dark Dany theory do not think that she\nshould be given the throne as a reward. They think she will die a conqueror,\nunable to give up her ambition for the greater good. She will go too far and\nsuffer the consequences.</p><p>Now, it\u2019s worth mentioning that all three of these theories\nI\u2019ve mentioned have flaws. Those who love Daenerys and want to see her on the\nthrone often ignore her good qualities while those who want to see Dany as an\nantagonist often ignore her bad qualities. The character is often reduced into\na simplistic binary of good vs evil, which is not what this show is about. The \u2018Dany\nwill get the throne\u2019 crowd ignores the idea that the ending of Game of Thrones\nwill be \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cbittersweet\u201d and the fact that George does not like\npredictable happily ever afters. </p><p>Meanwhile those who think Daenerys will go dark assume a\nHUGE amount of intentionality on the parts of the showrunners. They assume any\nlack of chemistry between Jon and Daenerys, any darker expression from\nDaenerys, and the framing of the attack on the Lannisters are intentional\nchoices. Some of this stuff could be errors in directing, writing and acting.\nCertainly, the showrunners have never been perfect. Just look at the dumb as\nhell Arya and Sansa plot that they wrote for season seven. So it\u2019s just as\nlikely that some of this \u201cforeshadowing\u201d is an error that will go\nunacknowledged in the final season.</p><p>Whatever the case, there is room for reasonable doubt and\nthat doubt will only be settled by season 8. It\u2019s going to be controversial no\nmatter what happens, but I wanted to make this post to show the perspective of\nall sides. And, perhaps, to foster courteous discussion. You can start fights\nin the notes if you want, but try to keep it classy. I think it\u2019s great that we\nall love a show so much to do so much analyzing of its content. At this point,\nthere\u2019s enough evidence to support all three theories and none of them are \u201cdelusional\u201d.\nYou may not like some of the theories. They might conflict with your personal\nbeliefs about the show. But there\u2019s not one way this thing could end.</p><p>So, yeah, if you have opinions, let me know. I know that I didn\u2019t get to all of the parallels. Like, I barely brushed the surface. This is meant to be an overview, not a deep dive. But again, keep\nit casual. I\u2019m not going to be fighting with any trolls. Besides, none of you\neven know which side I\u2019m on so you could be starting a fight over nothing!</p><p>I\u2019ll probably be writing one of these on the other main\ncharacters eventually. I might even\u2013if I\u2019m feeling very bold\u2013tackle the\nJonerys vs Jonsa debate. Lord help me if I do.</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>A little bit ago I made a post about Game of Thrones\nparallels and how parallels could be interpreted and read in multiple ways. I\nposited that while it is fun to make predictions based on parallels, it is\nsilly to insist that your reading is the ONLY CORRECT reading so long as we\ndon\u2019t have the ending of the show. Because without the ending, it is unclear\nwhat the show has been building to/going for. Until we have the ending, there\nare many readings we could give the parallels. And I\u2019ma go through some of them\ntoday.</p><p>Please note that I am going to attempt to be completely\nneutral in these readings. Even though I, of course, have stuff that I want to\nhappen/don\u2019t want to happen, I am still going to give every set of parallels a\nfair shake. Then you can decide for yourself which one you like best. Also, an\nimportant note, I am ONLY going to investigate show parallels. I know there\u2019s a\nlot more stuff in the books but if a part from the book didn\u2019t make it into the\nshow, I\u2019m going to assume it won\u2019t influence the show\u2019s ending. With that, I\u2019m\ngoing to start with the most controversial character of the show: Daenerys.</p><p>In my mind, there are three readings of Daenerys character\ngoing around the fandom right now:</p><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is a hero and is going to end up ruling the\nseven kingdoms after saving them from the white walkers. This ending usually\ninvolves her marrying Jon Snow and having a family.</p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is a hero, but will ultimately die in some\nway, never quite making it to the throne. Some theories have her dying in child\nbirth, and others have her dying in a heroic fashion. Either way, in this\ntheory, she chooses heroism over her own ambition.</p><p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is an antagonist who has been going darker\nwith each passing season and in this season she will choose ambition over the\nrealms and become as much a danger as the white walkers.</p><p>So this is a sort of positive, bittersweet and negative\nreading of Daenerys\u2019 arc and trajectory. I\u2019m going to focus on her in each of\nthese arcs. Obviously, shipping stuff is going to come up as it is often tied\nto these parallel reads, but I\u2019ll try to keep it focused on her. But I do think\nI should emphasize that I don\u2019t have a bone in this shipping battle. I\u2019m not\nhardcore for Jonsa or Jonerys. This is an objective as possible, non-shipper\nreading of Dany.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with <b>THEORY\nNUMBER ONE:</b> <b>The positive reading.</b>\n</p><p>This reading revolves around reading Daenerys as a mostly\nmorally good character. Not a character without flaws, of course, but a\ncharacter whose intentions and goals are ultimately just and right. Daenerys\nstarts out in a position of little to no power. This could be paralleled with\nmany other characters in Game of Thrones but, most notably, Sansa. She is not a\nfighter. She is a physically weak princess type. And in some was she\nforeshadows Sansa\u2019s struggles in the later seasons (of being married against\nher will, isolated from her home, becoming disillusioned and learning to find\nher power and stand up for herself). For the purposes of this reading we are\ngoing to call this a positive parallel. We are meant to sympathize equally with\nSansa and Daenerys\u2019 arcs and root for them as they come into their own and\nembrace their name.</p><p>Daenerys can also be paralleled with Jon. As a bastard, he\nhas no claim or ability to inherit anything from his family. As a woman,\nDaenerys\u2019 brother has authority over her. Neither of them are supposed to have\nany strong claim to the throne but by the end, they both seem to be in the best\nposition to take it. But we\u2019ll get more into their relationship later.</p><p>Game of Thrones is full of hard moral choices, and a\npositive reading suggests that Daenerys is another maker of those hard moral\nchoices. When she kills, it is for a variety of reasons. In some cases, she\nkills for vengeance when she burns the witch who killed Khal Drogo and locks\nher betrayers in Quarth. This is parallel to characters like Oberyn Martell and\nRobb Stark (Robb goes to war to get vengeance and justice for his father and\nexpresses how he would like to \u2018kill them all\u2019 when referring to the\nLannisters). This is most parallel of all to Arya Stark, who has been on a\nvengeance train since season 2. Daenerys also kills for justice. After the\nmasters of Mereen crucify several children, she pays them back by crucifying the\nsame number of masters. This treatment could be seen as a parallel to\ncharacters like Ned Stark and Stannis, who are very justice focused. Ned Stark\nwould have beheaded Jorah for selling slaves and has beheaded many men for\nbreaking vows, regardless of circumstances.</p><p>Daenerys has also killed as part of war which many, many\ncharacters have done on all sides of the moral spectrum. Robb Stark sent some\nof his men to their deaths to give them a victory over Jaime Lannister. Stannis\nattacked at the Battle of Blackwater, planning to sack the city which would\nhave led to a whole lot of death. Daenerys does the same and tries to avoid\nattacking civilians. That is not to say she isn\u2019t tempted to attack cities but\nshe can usually be talked down. Her focus is on those who attack her, those who\nviolate the law, and those who take up arms against her. There are times she\nseems to enjoy the rush of killing her enemies because it makes her feel\npowerful, but we\u2019ve seen that in Arya, Sansa, the Hound, Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime\netc.</p><p>Another important character parallel is between Daenerys and\nher father. Her father liked to burn people alive and was, by all accounts, one\nof the most awful kings to have ever ruled. They have some similarities. He was\nalso apparently ambitious and had a lot of high ideals. He did not always\nconsider reality because as a Targaryen he felt himself beyond it. Daenerys\ncertainly embraces her name just as fiercely, and her claim to the throne rests\non the fact that he was the last king. </p><p>However, in this reading we take her at her word: that she\nis not her father. She shows more basic compassion than her father, reaches out\nto the poor and needy, tries not to hurt innocents. She does not burn King\u2019s\nLanding for this reason, while her father was keen to blow the whole place up\nduring his losing war. She also asks her councilors to warn her if they see her\ngoing too far. As Tyrion says \u201cshe knows herself\u201d and wants to improve upon her\nflaws. Sometimes she listens to her advisors and sometimes she doesn\u2019t. This is\nthe same as any king/queen with their councilors. Therefore, because she is\nself aware of her father\u2019s bloody legacy, she is destined to improve on the\npast and be a better ruler than him. She is also attempting to improve on her\nancestor Aegon\u2019s work. He was a conqueror who built the wheel that is the iron\nthrone, but Daenerys has expressed the desire to break the wheel. Maybe this\nwill lead to reforms to improve the monarchy and it\u2019s relationship with the\nseven kingdoms.</p><p>Since many of the other main characters have killed and even\nenjoyed killing, she cannot be placed as darker than any of the rest of them.\nShe is simply one of many morally grey characters on a spectrum. And therefore\na hero of Game of Thrones.</p><p>A hero prioritizes the weak over those in power. A hero\nprioritizes the safety of the people over their own ambition. Most important to\nthis reading is the fact that Daenerys agreed to help Jon Snow whether he bends\nthe knee to her or not. He then, of course, proceeds to bend the knee to her,\nbut she does recognize the necessity of beating the Army of the Dead before\nclaiming her throne. This is foreshadowed in the House of the Undying. Because she\ndid not touch the throne and instead headed the call of her dragons, she proved\nthat she was able to resist ambition when the time called for it. Just like she\nwas rewarded in season 2 (with finding her dragons), she will ultimately be\nrewarded with the throne she worked so hard to claim at the end of season 8. And,\nperhaps, she will break the wheel that is the throne and usher Westeros into a\nbetter future\u2013probably alongside Jon Snow.</p><p><b>THEORY NUMBER TWO </b>assumes\neverything that I just said about Daenerys being ultimately good. But the\nending is changed. Instead, her not touching the throne symbolizes her final\nsacrifice. That she will save the realms but ultimately she will not have the\nthrone. She had to fully sacrifice her ambition to make Westeros safe again.\nHowever, this is a heroic death, and one that clears the way for future\ngenerations.</p><p>Others, in this tragic death theory, believe she will die in\nchild birth. There has been a lot of strong foreshadowing to suggest Daenerys\nwill have a baby. They kept bringing it up in season 7, after all. And she\nvisually paralleled with Lyanna Stark while having the boat sex with Jon Snow\nwith the \u201cHe loved her and she loved him\u201d line. Lyanna died in child birth and\nRhaegar died in battle, leaving Jon Snow alone. It is possible that a new child\nwill be born and left without parents in the same way. Such is the cost of war.\nThis fits as well with the idea that the ending will be \u201cbittersweet\u201d. It would\nbe bitter sweet to have two major characters die but their child survive.</p><p>Many are also certain Daenerys is going to die because she\nhas been immune to death for so long. All of us knew that she wasn\u2019t dying\nbefore she crossed the narrow sea. George, and the directors, are famous for\nkilling off unexpected characters, so it would be in line with their philosophy\nof \u201cno one is safe\u201d if they killed one of the biggest and most recognizable\ncharacters of the show.</p><p>Now, in reference to theory one and two, we need to talk\nabout Daenerys\u2019 parallels with Jon Snow. They both started out with less power\nand not very much respect. They also (as has been pointed out soooo many times)\nseem to represent ice and fire. Even the climates where they exist represent\nice and fire. Throughout the seasons they both lose their first loves (which\nbegan under circumstances of dubious consent), grow in authority, gain many\nfollowers and allies, have a mystical animal companion, make tough choices that\ncome with ruling, and prove themselves in battle.</p><p>Daenerys faces her most complicated choices in season four\nand five. Same with Jon Snow. They both take up temporary positions of power,\nthat will not be the end goal for their stories (queen of Mereen/Lord\nCommander). At the end of season five, Daenerys is alone in the middle of\nnowhere, surrounded by Dothraki. Jon Snow has been killed. They have fallen\nfrom their position. But they are able to rise up again. By the end of season\nsix, Jon has returned to Winterfell and become King in the North and Daenerys\nhas set out to take her place as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. These parallels\nare meant to show their similarities and foreshadow that they\u2019ve been moving\ntoward each other the whole story. They meet as equals, negotiate as equals,\nand eventually fall for each other as equals. It could be argued that Daenerys\nis putting herself over Jon in this season but he does not allow her to make\nhim feel lesser and their relationship only begins once she puts herself on his\nlevel and his vulnerable with him. And since they\u2019re both Targaryen, the incest\nthing won\u2019t be seen as immoral or out of the ordinary.</p><p>Because they have been so tightly linked, we can predict\nthat in the positive and bitter sweet theories they will either live together\nor die together. In the positive theory, it was meant to be and after so much\nsuffering a struggle, they will earn a happy ending in the end. They compliment\neach other because Jon is more humble and down to earth while Daenerys\npossessed more of the ambition and idealism needed in a leader. They will make\ngood rulers together.</p><p>Or, they have been tragic hero\u2019s from the start and, like\nLyanna and Rhaegar before them, they will not survive the Long Night. But they\nwill bring peace to the realms through their deaths. Lyanna and Rhaegar\u2019s match\ncaused discord and a war in the kingdoms. Their match and sacrifice will bring\nabout peace, which gives us our bitter sweet ending.</p><p>Either way, according to these two theories, when these two\nmajor characters come together in season 7 it is supposed to feel as if two\npeople who have been walking similar journeys are finally uniting with a common\npurpose, bringing the Stark and Targaryen houses together again. They\u2019ve come\nfrom opposite sides of the world, the two last Targaryens, two of the most\nisolated characters in the series, and now they find a place in each other.</p><p>Then there is the very different <b>THEORY THREE: The Dark Daenerys Theory</b></p><p>First off, I think the name Dark! Dany is misleading. It\nimplies that those who subscribe to this theory believe she is evil. Many of\nthem do not. Rather, they see her moving into the role of the antagonist in the\nfinal season of the show. Many people who support this theory ALSO do not hate\nDaenerys, which is important to remember. But for the reasons we are about to\ndiscuss, they prefer her character in the role of the antagonist. This theory\nis not without precedent, and in fact has many parallels that could potentially\nback it up.</p><p>First off, this theory takes a more negative view on\nDaenerys\u2019 parallels with Aegon and Aerys. While the readers of the past few\ntheories believe that she will improve on her ancestors, readers of THIS\ntheory, believe that the cycle is destined to repeat itself. Aegon and Aerys\nwere both visionaries with a high opinion of themselves. Daenerys, like them,\nwill reap destruction on the realms and, like her father, will meet an awful\nend for it. \u201cThe cycle repeats itself\u201d is a very common trope in literature, so\nthis isn\u2019t an unfair reading. The idea of a character trying to avoid their\nfate but tragically falling into it? A classic, and it\u2019s happened to LOTs of\ncharacters on this show. It could certainly happen to Daenerys as well. This\ntheory also takes a more negative view on her parallels to Jon Snow, but we\u2019ll\nget to that in a second.</p><p>So, remember how I said all characters in Game of thrones\nare morally grey to some degree? They don\u2019t all do good shit. But still, many\nof those characters take on the role of protagonist. Arya, Tyrion, Jaime,\nCersei, and Stannis are all morally grey characters who have, at some point,\nbeen in the protagonist seat. Some of them have ALSO been in the antagonist\nseat. So it\u2019s a bit complicated. A lot of people like to compare Daenerys to\nCersei. Certainly there are parallels between them. They have both burned\npeople alive. They are both strong and confident women with a legendary death\nglare. And they have both been victims of a misogynist society. They were both\nmarried off against their will. We can feel sympathy with them because of this.\n</p><p>But Cersei is more often seen in the antagonist role because\nof where she is placed in the narrative. She is fighting characters that WE\nlike. From the very beginning she is set up as an antagonist against the\nStarks. Daenerys on the other hand? She\u2019s the only protagonist in Essos, so all\nof the story content there is told from her perspective. This makes it a bit\nharder to put her actions in perspective (until she comes to Westeros, but we\u2019ll\nget to that later). They are also both ignored for their brothers and are very\neffected by their father\u2019s legacies. They are both trying to succeed their\nfathers. Cersei obviously embraces Tywin\u2019s methods while Daenerys is actively\nworking to avoid becoming her father, but in the eyes of people who subscribe\nto this theory, she has been moving slowly in the direction of Mad King Aerys.</p><p>However, there are some clear differences between Dany and\nCersei. Cersei sort of embraces being a bad person and Dany is genuinely trying\nto do good. She wants to be just. That\u2019s what she strives for. She sees herself\nas a savior. For that reason, I think the best character to parallel with\nDaenerys for this theory is <i>Stannis.</i></p><p>Stannis and Daenerys are extremely similar characters, in\ncircumstance and personality. Both were second in line to the throne, next to\ntheir older brothers. Neither had a good relationship with said brother. Both\nbecame the \u201crightful heir\u201d to the throne one their brother died and they lean\nvery heavily on that fact. They have a lot of similar dialogue claiming the throne\nbelongs to them by right and that they will take what belongs to them. They\nalso are the two characters who execute people by burning. Fire is a very\nimportant element for them. And of course, they are both predicted to be at the\ncenter of the same prophesy. Most importantly they both believe in the\nrighteousness of their cause. They believe they are doing the right thing.</p><p>We don\u2019t yet know the ending of Daenerys\u2019 arc. But we DO\nknow the ending of Stannis\u2019 arc. Though he believes in the good of his cause,\nhas honorable allies to chose him (like Davos), does some good things, and\nfights against people we consider bad\u2013he goes too far and he falls for it.</p><p>Stannis died because he was willing to sacrifice his\ndaughter for his ambition. He burned a screaming child on a pyre to give him a\nchance against the Boltons, expecting to be rewarded for his noble sacrifice:\nand he failed. He died. All that time spent talking about how he was the\nrightful heir to the throne and it was all for nothing because he went too far.\nHe got too focused on himself as the savior and sacrificed the most important\nthing in his life. This could be foreshadowing for Daenerys (whether she goes\nlight or dark). In order to ever earn the throne, she must be willing to\nsacrifice her ambition. And if in the final season she ever goes too far or\nignores the real threat in favor of her throne, she will be punished in some\nway, just like Stannis was. This isn\u2019t a certainty that she WILL make the wrong\nchoice, but it certainly sets up that she will face a choice.</p><p>See, Game of Thrones is big on the \u2018all actions have\nconsequences\u2019 thing. Robb died for breaking his vow, Ned died because he was\ntoo honorable and foolish in a dishonorable place. Oberyn died because he was\ntoo set on his perfect vengeance. Tywin died because he was a dick to his son.\nStannis died because he burned his daughter alive. And Rickon died because he\ndidn\u2019t run in a zig zag (Too soon? Too soon). Whatever theory you subscribe to,\nI think it\u2019s clear that Daenerys will face a major choice in season 8 that will\nhave major consequences.</p><p>Going back to Stannis for a minute: it is also Stannis who\nshows us the not so great nature of fire. This is the basis for a lot of Dark!\nDany theorists reasoning. Fire has never been portrayed as the good element\nthat fights off the evil ice. It has many times been shown in a negative light.\nStannis burning people for his religion, the wild fire that Tyrion uses on the\nBlackwater and Cersei uses to blow up the sept. Fire and ice have both been\ndestructive forces throughout. One is not better than the other. So people who\nbelieve in this theory see fire and ice not as opposing forces but as two equal\nthreats about to descend on Westeros. This is further backed up by the plot\nstructure of Dany and the white walker\u2019s arrival in Westeros. They\u2019ve been\npresent since season 1 but have only now arrived in Westeros in season 7 (Dany\nat the beginning and the white walkers at the end). </p><p>Likewise, fans of this theory believe that Dany and Jon have\nbeen paralleled not to show them as lost souls who have found each other but to\nset up two opposing forces that will eventually clash. Two Targaryens who are\nrivals for the throne. This theory focuses a lot on the DIFFERENCES between Jon\nand Daenerys. Jon always seems to struggle with killing people, even those who\ndefy him or actively killed him. He hesitates. He appears visibly uncomfortable.\nDaenerys seems to revel in the sight of people burning, especially later on in\nthe series. There\u2019s something satisfied about it. One could easily argue that\nDany is just better at putting on a face than Jon and she is just as disturbed\nby executing people, but if that is the case, the show hasn\u2019t shown it as\nclearly. (Note: this could just as easily be a directing/acting problem).</p><p>It\u2019s also fair to point out that, while lots of people\nsupporting the first theory ship Jonerys, a lot of people supporting this\ntheory support Jonsa. They see Sansa as a better queen than Daenerys. I don\u2019t\nlike to pit female characters against each other, but at the very least, one\ncan say that Sansa is a bit more down to earth because of her many hard earned\nlessons. She thinks more about the practical problems of winter and, as she\nsays to Arya \u201cchopping off people\u2019s heads is satisfying but it\u2019s not a way to\nget them to work together\u201d. Execution is not her first inclination. She only\npulls it after someone has truly revealed themselves to be despicable.\nDaenerys, on the other hand, executes men before knowing if they are guilty or\nnot in season five.</p><p>Regardless, those who believe in this theory tend to focus\non Daenerys\u2019 more sinister acts. Her temper, her desire for vengeance, her fascination\nwith fire. But this does not erase her good deeds either. Trying to end\nslavery, rescuing the weak, locking up her dragons after she finds out that\nthey are causing problems. Again: she\u2019s a grey character. The difference\nbetween the dark vs light Dany theory is that one side believes her darker acts\nare ultimately the most significant to her arc and the light side believes her\ngood acts are ultimately the most significant part of her arc.</p><p>But again, Daenerys, up until now has been pitted against\nnameless faces. So how is she framed when she is put up against characters we\nknow and love? Particularly, long time antagonist house: The Lannisters.</p><p>The attack on the Lannisters is one of the most fascinating\nscenes in the whole show to me. Because put aside the fact that yes, Daenerys\nis attacking soldiers opposing her in war. Put aside the fact that she is\nrefusing to attack innocent civilians. Put aside the fact that many viewers are\nrooting for her and she is way more popular than most of the Lannisters. This\nscene frames Daenerys as the antagonist. </p><p>The camera primarily focuses on three characters: Jaime,\nBronn and Tyrion. We do not follow Daenerys as she sweeps down upon her\nenemies. We follow the Lannisters watching in horror as she arrives. This is\nlike the Huns coming over the ridge in Mulan (no really, it\u2019s introduced almost\nthe exact same way). We zoom in on Jaime and Bronn\u2019s stunned expressions. We\nalso focus on Dickon\u2019s horror as well. The camera lingers on the bodies of\nsoldiers crumbling to ash. It lingers on Tyrion, looking on, astounded by the\nlevel of destruction that can be wrought by the dragon. But he\u2019s seeing the men\nwho serve his family dying. He\u2019s worried for his brother.</p><p>There is no sense of joy in Daenerys\u2019 victory here. We don\u2019t\ncut to her after the battle, feeling satisfied. We cut to Tyrion wandering\nthrough the ashes of Westeros soldiers, looking absolutely devastated. And even\nthough Sam\u2019s dad is a dick, his death alongside his son is still framed in this\nreally gruesome way. Tyrion is the point of view character through all of this.\nWe feel distant from Daenerys in this scene. What is she thinking? What is her\nmotive? But she is separate from the others, which is a classic way to frame a\nvillain in film. </p><p>And her soldiers? They are a faceless threat. We don\u2019t have\nany Dothraki soldiers who we know and love. The show didn\u2019t bother giving any\nof them personalities which could be an error in the writing or something but I\ndon\u2019t know. In the Unsullied, we know Grey worm, and he\u2019s not even in this\nbattle. Contrast this with the scene we got with the Ed Sheeren Lannister\nsoldiers in episode one\u2013a shockingly nice moment where we see the normal\npeople of Westeros just trying to get through their lives. It\u2019s significant\nthat it forces Arya to recognize some of the Lannisters as human and then they\nprobably got cooked in that battle. We do not get any such conversations with Daenerys\u2019\nsoldiers in this season.</p><p>There are also people who point out Daenerys burning the\nsupplies in this attack\u2013supplies that would be sorely needed in the winter\ntime. This supports the idea that Daario put forward in a previous episode.\nThat Daenerys is not a ruler made to sit on an iron chair. She is far more\ncomfortable and confident on a dragon. She is a conqueror. And conquerors do\nnot always have the foresight to plan for the future. They sweep in, they\ndestroy, they leave ashes in their wake. One could argue that this was what\nDany did in Essos. She certainly didn\u2019t establish a stable system of government\nin Mereen before she left for the real goal: Westeros. And for all of those\nreasons, those who subscribe to the Dark Dany theory do not think that she\nshould be given the throne as a reward. They think she will die a conqueror,\nunable to give up her ambition for the greater good. She will go too far and\nsuffer the consequences.</p><p>Now, it\u2019s worth mentioning that all three of these theories\nI\u2019ve mentioned have flaws. Those who love Daenerys and want to see her on the\nthrone often ignore her good qualities while those who want to see Dany as an\nantagonist often ignore her bad qualities. The character is often reduced into\na simplistic binary of good vs evil, which is not what this show is about. The \u2018Dany\nwill get the throne\u2019 crowd ignores the idea that the ending of Game of Thrones\nwill be \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cbittersweet\u201d and the fact that George does not like\npredictable happily ever afters. </p><p>Meanwhile those who think Daenerys will go dark assume a\nHUGE amount of intentionality on the parts of the showrunners. They assume any\nlack of chemistry between Jon and Daenerys, any darker expression from\nDaenerys, and the framing of the attack on the Lannisters are intentional\nchoices. Some of this stuff could be errors in directing, writing and acting.\nCertainly, the showrunners have never been perfect. Just look at the dumb as\nhell Arya and Sansa plot that they wrote for season seven. So it\u2019s just as\nlikely that some of this \u201cforeshadowing\u201d is an error that will go\nunacknowledged in the final season.</p><p>Whatever the case, there is room for reasonable doubt and\nthat doubt will only be settled by season 8. It\u2019s going to be controversial no\nmatter what happens, but I wanted to make this post to show the perspective of\nall sides. And, perhaps, to foster courteous discussion. You can start fights\nin the notes if you want, but try to keep it classy. I think it\u2019s great that we\nall love a show so much to do so much analyzing of its content. At this point,\nthere\u2019s enough evidence to support all three theories and none of them are \u201cdelusional\u201d.\nYou may not like some of the theories. They might conflict with your personal\nbeliefs about the show. But there\u2019s not one way this thing could end.</p><p>So, yeah, if you have opinions, let me know. I know that I didn\u2019t get to all of the parallels. Like, I barely brushed the surface. This is meant to be an overview, not a deep dive. But again, keep\nit casual. I\u2019m not going to be fighting with any trolls. Besides, none of you\neven know which side I\u2019m on so you could be starting a fight over nothing!</p><p>I\u2019ll probably be writing one of these on the other main\ncharacters eventually. I might even\u2013if I\u2019m feeling very bold\u2013tackle the\nJonerys vs Jonsa debate. Lord help me if I do.</p>",
                "content": "<p>A little bit ago I made a post about Game of Thrones\nparallels and how parallels could be interpreted and read in multiple ways. I\nposited that while it is fun to make predictions based on parallels, it is\nsilly to insist that your reading is the ONLY CORRECT reading so long as we\ndon&rsquo;t have the ending of the show. Because without the ending, it is unclear\nwhat the show has been building to/going for. Until we have the ending, there\nare many readings we could give the parallels. And I&rsquo;ma go through some of them\ntoday.</p><p>Please note that I am going to attempt to be completely\nneutral in these readings. Even though I, of course, have stuff that I want to\nhappen/don&rsquo;t want to happen, I am still going to give every set of parallels a\nfair shake. Then you can decide for yourself which one you like best. Also, an\nimportant note, I am ONLY going to investigate show parallels. I know there&rsquo;s a\nlot more stuff in the books but if a part from the book didn&rsquo;t make it into the\nshow, I&rsquo;m going to assume it won&rsquo;t influence the show&rsquo;s ending. With that, I&rsquo;m\ngoing to start with the most controversial character of the show: Daenerys.</p><p>In my mind, there are three readings of Daenerys character\ngoing around the fandom right now:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nShe is a hero and is going to end up ruling the\nseven kingdoms after saving them from the white walkers. This ending usually\ninvolves her marrying Jon Snow and having a family.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nShe is a hero, but will ultimately die in some\nway, never quite making it to the throne. Some theories have her dying in child\nbirth, and others have her dying in a heroic fashion. Either way, in this\ntheory, she chooses heroism over her own ambition.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nShe is an antagonist who has been going darker\nwith each passing season and in this season she will choose ambition over the\nrealms and become as much a danger as the white walkers.</p><p>So this is a sort of positive, bittersweet and negative\nreading of Daenerys&rsquo; arc and trajectory. I&rsquo;m going to focus on her in each of\nthese arcs. Obviously, shipping stuff is going to come up as it is often tied\nto these parallel reads, but I&rsquo;ll try to keep it focused on her. But I do think\nI should emphasize that I don&rsquo;t have a bone in this shipping battle. I&rsquo;m not\nhardcore for Jonsa or Jonerys. This is an objective as possible, non-shipper\nreading of Dany.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with <b>THEORY\nNUMBER ONE:</b> <b>The positive reading.</b>\n</p><p>This reading revolves around reading Daenerys as a mostly\nmorally good character. Not a character without flaws, of course, but a\ncharacter whose intentions and goals are ultimately just and right. Daenerys\nstarts out in a position of little to no power. This could be paralleled with\nmany other characters in Game of Thrones but, most notably, Sansa. She is not a\nfighter. She is a physically weak princess type. And in some was she\nforeshadows Sansa&rsquo;s struggles in the later seasons (of being married against\nher will, isolated from her home, becoming disillusioned and learning to find\nher power and stand up for herself). For the purposes of this reading we are\ngoing to call this a positive parallel. We are meant to sympathize equally with\nSansa and Daenerys&rsquo; arcs and root for them as they come into their own and\nembrace their name.</p><p>Daenerys can also be paralleled with Jon. As a bastard, he\nhas no claim or ability to inherit anything from his family. As a woman,\nDaenerys&rsquo; brother has authority over her. Neither of them are supposed to have\nany strong claim to the throne but by the end, they both seem to be in the best\nposition to take it. But we&rsquo;ll get more into their relationship later.</p><p>Game of Thrones is full of hard moral choices, and a\npositive reading suggests that Daenerys is another maker of those hard moral\nchoices. When she kills, it is for a variety of reasons. In some cases, she\nkills for vengeance when she burns the witch who killed Khal Drogo and locks\nher betrayers in Quarth. This is parallel to characters like Oberyn Martell and\nRobb Stark (Robb goes to war to get vengeance and justice for his father and\nexpresses how he would like to &lsquo;kill them all&rsquo; when referring to the\nLannisters). This is most parallel of all to Arya Stark, who has been on a\nvengeance train since season 2. Daenerys also kills for justice. After the\nmasters of Mereen crucify several children, she pays them back by crucifying the\nsame number of masters. This treatment could be seen as a parallel to\ncharacters like Ned Stark and Stannis, who are very justice focused. Ned Stark\nwould have beheaded Jorah for selling slaves and has beheaded many men for\nbreaking vows, regardless of circumstances.</p><p>Daenerys has also killed as part of war which many, many\ncharacters have done on all sides of the moral spectrum. Robb Stark sent some\nof his men to their deaths to give them a victory over Jaime Lannister. Stannis\nattacked at the Battle of Blackwater, planning to sack the city which would\nhave led to a whole lot of death. Daenerys does the same and tries to avoid\nattacking civilians. That is not to say she isn&rsquo;t tempted to attack cities but\nshe can usually be talked down. Her focus is on those who attack her, those who\nviolate the law, and those who take up arms against her. There are times she\nseems to enjoy the rush of killing her enemies because it makes her feel\npowerful, but we&rsquo;ve seen that in Arya, Sansa, the Hound, Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime\netc.</p><p>Another important character parallel is between Daenerys and\nher father. Her father liked to burn people alive and was, by all accounts, one\nof the most awful kings to have ever ruled. They have some similarities. He was\nalso apparently ambitious and had a lot of high ideals. He did not always\nconsider reality because as a Targaryen he felt himself beyond it. Daenerys\ncertainly embraces her name just as fiercely, and her claim to the throne rests\non the fact that he was the last king. </p><p>However, in this reading we take her at her word: that she\nis not her father. She shows more basic compassion than her father, reaches out\nto the poor and needy, tries not to hurt innocents. She does not burn King&rsquo;s\nLanding for this reason, while her father was keen to blow the whole place up\nduring his losing war. She also asks her councilors to warn her if they see her\ngoing too far. As Tyrion says &ldquo;she knows herself&rdquo; and wants to improve upon her\nflaws. Sometimes she listens to her advisors and sometimes she doesn&rsquo;t. This is\nthe same as any king/queen with their councilors. Therefore, because she is\nself aware of her father&rsquo;s bloody legacy, she is destined to improve on the\npast and be a better ruler than him. She is also attempting to improve on her\nancestor Aegon&rsquo;s work. He was a conqueror who built the wheel that is the iron\nthrone, but Daenerys has expressed the desire to break the wheel. Maybe this\nwill lead to reforms to improve the monarchy and it&rsquo;s relationship with the\nseven kingdoms.</p><p>Since many of the other main characters have killed and even\nenjoyed killing, she cannot be placed as darker than any of the rest of them.\nShe is simply one of many morally grey characters on a spectrum. And therefore\na hero of Game of Thrones.</p><p>A hero prioritizes the weak over those in power. A hero\nprioritizes the safety of the people over their own ambition. Most important to\nthis reading is the fact that Daenerys agreed to help Jon Snow whether he bends\nthe knee to her or not. He then, of course, proceeds to bend the knee to her,\nbut she does recognize the necessity of beating the Army of the Dead before\nclaiming her throne. This is foreshadowed in the House of the Undying. Because she\ndid not touch the throne and instead headed the call of her dragons, she proved\nthat she was able to resist ambition when the time called for it. Just like she\nwas rewarded in season 2 (with finding her dragons), she will ultimately be\nrewarded with the throne she worked so hard to claim at the end of season 8. And,\nperhaps, she will break the wheel that is the throne and usher Westeros into a\nbetter future&ndash;probably alongside Jon Snow.</p><p><b>THEORY NUMBER TWO </b>assumes\neverything that I just said about Daenerys being ultimately good. But the\nending is changed. Instead, her not touching the throne symbolizes her final\nsacrifice. That she will save the realms but ultimately she will not have the\nthrone. She had to fully sacrifice her ambition to make Westeros safe again.\nHowever, this is a heroic death, and one that clears the way for future\ngenerations.</p><p>Others, in this tragic death theory, believe she will die in\nchild birth. There has been a lot of strong foreshadowing to suggest Daenerys\nwill have a baby. They kept bringing it up in season 7, after all. And she\nvisually paralleled with Lyanna Stark while having the boat sex with Jon Snow\nwith the &ldquo;He loved her and she loved him&rdquo; line. Lyanna died in child birth and\nRhaegar died in battle, leaving Jon Snow alone. It is possible that a new child\nwill be born and left without parents in the same way. Such is the cost of war.\nThis fits as well with the idea that the ending will be &ldquo;bittersweet&rdquo;. It would\nbe bitter sweet to have two major characters die but their child survive.</p><p>Many are also certain Daenerys is going to die because she\nhas been immune to death for so long. All of us knew that she wasn&rsquo;t dying\nbefore she crossed the narrow sea. George, and the directors, are famous for\nkilling off unexpected characters, so it would be in line with their philosophy\nof &ldquo;no one is safe&rdquo; if they killed one of the biggest and most recognizable\ncharacters of the show.</p><p>Now, in reference to theory one and two, we need to talk\nabout Daenerys&rsquo; parallels with Jon Snow. They both started out with less power\nand not very much respect. They also (as has been pointed out soooo many times)\nseem to represent ice and fire. Even the climates where they exist represent\nice and fire. Throughout the seasons they both lose their first loves (which\nbegan under circumstances of dubious consent), grow in authority, gain many\nfollowers and allies, have a mystical animal companion, make tough choices that\ncome with ruling, and prove themselves in battle.</p><p>Daenerys faces her most complicated choices in season four\nand five. Same with Jon Snow. They both take up temporary positions of power,\nthat will not be the end goal for their stories (queen of Mereen/Lord\nCommander). At the end of season five, Daenerys is alone in the middle of\nnowhere, surrounded by Dothraki. Jon Snow has been killed. They have fallen\nfrom their position. But they are able to rise up again. By the end of season\nsix, Jon has returned to Winterfell and become King in the North and Daenerys\nhas set out to take her place as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. These parallels\nare meant to show their similarities and foreshadow that they&rsquo;ve been moving\ntoward each other the whole story. They meet as equals, negotiate as equals,\nand eventually fall for each other as equals. It could be argued that Daenerys\nis putting herself over Jon in this season but he does not allow her to make\nhim feel lesser and their relationship only begins once she puts herself on his\nlevel and his vulnerable with him. And since they&rsquo;re both Targaryen, the incest\nthing won&rsquo;t be seen as immoral or out of the ordinary.</p><p>Because they have been so tightly linked, we can predict\nthat in the positive and bitter sweet theories they will either live together\nor die together. In the positive theory, it was meant to be and after so much\nsuffering a struggle, they will earn a happy ending in the end. They compliment\neach other because Jon is more humble and down to earth while Daenerys\npossessed more of the ambition and idealism needed in a leader. They will make\ngood rulers together.</p><p>Or, they have been tragic hero&rsquo;s from the start and, like\nLyanna and Rhaegar before them, they will not survive the Long Night. But they\nwill bring peace to the realms through their deaths. Lyanna and Rhaegar&rsquo;s match\ncaused discord and a war in the kingdoms. Their match and sacrifice will bring\nabout peace, which gives us our bitter sweet ending.</p><p>Either way, according to these two theories, when these two\nmajor characters come together in season 7 it is supposed to feel as if two\npeople who have been walking similar journeys are finally uniting with a common\npurpose, bringing the Stark and Targaryen houses together again. They&rsquo;ve come\nfrom opposite sides of the world, the two last Targaryens, two of the most\nisolated characters in the series, and now they find a place in each other.</p><p>Then there is the very different <b>THEORY THREE: The Dark Daenerys Theory</b></p><p>First off, I think the name Dark! Dany is misleading. It\nimplies that those who subscribe to this theory believe she is evil. Many of\nthem do not. Rather, they see her moving into the role of the antagonist in the\nfinal season of the show. Many people who support this theory ALSO do not hate\nDaenerys, which is important to remember. But for the reasons we are about to\ndiscuss, they prefer her character in the role of the antagonist. This theory\nis not without precedent, and in fact has many parallels that could potentially\nback it up.</p><p>First off, this theory takes a more negative view on\nDaenerys&rsquo; parallels with Aegon and Aerys. While the readers of the past few\ntheories believe that she will improve on her ancestors, readers of THIS\ntheory, believe that the cycle is destined to repeat itself. Aegon and Aerys\nwere both visionaries with a high opinion of themselves. Daenerys, like them,\nwill reap destruction on the realms and, like her father, will meet an awful\nend for it. &ldquo;The cycle repeats itself&rdquo; is a very common trope in literature, so\nthis isn&rsquo;t an unfair reading. The idea of a character trying to avoid their\nfate but tragically falling into it? A classic, and it&rsquo;s happened to LOTs of\ncharacters on this show. It could certainly happen to Daenerys as well. This\ntheory also takes a more negative view on her parallels to Jon Snow, but we&rsquo;ll\nget to that in a second.</p><p>So, remember how I said all characters in Game of thrones\nare morally grey to some degree? They don&rsquo;t all do good shit. But still, many\nof those characters take on the role of protagonist. Arya, Tyrion, Jaime,\nCersei, and Stannis are all morally grey characters who have, at some point,\nbeen in the protagonist seat. Some of them have ALSO been in the antagonist\nseat. So it&rsquo;s a bit complicated. A lot of people like to compare Daenerys to\nCersei. Certainly there are parallels between them. They have both burned\npeople alive. They are both strong and confident women with a legendary death\nglare. And they have both been victims of a misogynist society. They were both\nmarried off against their will. We can feel sympathy with them because of this.\n</p><p>But Cersei is more often seen in the antagonist role because\nof where she is placed in the narrative. She is fighting characters that WE\nlike. From the very beginning she is set up as an antagonist against the\nStarks. Daenerys on the other hand? She&rsquo;s the only protagonist in Essos, so all\nof the story content there is told from her perspective. This makes it a bit\nharder to put her actions in perspective (until she comes to Westeros, but we&rsquo;ll\nget to that later). They are also both ignored for their brothers and are very\neffected by their father&rsquo;s legacies. They are both trying to succeed their\nfathers. Cersei obviously embraces Tywin&rsquo;s methods while Daenerys is actively\nworking to avoid becoming her father, but in the eyes of people who subscribe\nto this theory, she has been moving slowly in the direction of Mad King Aerys.</p><p>However, there are some clear differences between Dany and\nCersei. Cersei sort of embraces being a bad person and Dany is genuinely trying\nto do good. She wants to be just. That&rsquo;s what she strives for. She sees herself\nas a savior. For that reason, I think the best character to parallel with\nDaenerys for this theory is <i>Stannis.</i></p><p>Stannis and Daenerys are extremely similar characters, in\ncircumstance and personality. Both were second in line to the throne, next to\ntheir older brothers. Neither had a good relationship with said brother. Both\nbecame the &ldquo;rightful heir&rdquo; to the throne one their brother died and they lean\nvery heavily on that fact. They have a lot of similar dialogue claiming the throne\nbelongs to them by right and that they will take what belongs to them. They\nalso are the two characters who execute people by burning. Fire is a very\nimportant element for them. And of course, they are both predicted to be at the\ncenter of the same prophesy. Most importantly they both believe in the\nrighteousness of their cause. They believe they are doing the right thing.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t yet know the ending of Daenerys&rsquo; arc. But we DO\nknow the ending of Stannis&rsquo; arc. Though he believes in the good of his cause,\nhas honorable allies to chose him (like Davos), does some good things, and\nfights against people we consider bad&ndash;he goes too far and he falls for it.</p><p>Stannis died because he was willing to sacrifice his\ndaughter for his ambition. He burned a screaming child on a pyre to give him a\nchance against the Boltons, expecting to be rewarded for his noble sacrifice:\nand he failed. He died. All that time spent talking about how he was the\nrightful heir to the throne and it was all for nothing because he went too far.\nHe got too focused on himself as the savior and sacrificed the most important\nthing in his life. This could be foreshadowing for Daenerys (whether she goes\nlight or dark). In order to ever earn the throne, she must be willing to\nsacrifice her ambition. And if in the final season she ever goes too far or\nignores the real threat in favor of her throne, she will be punished in some\nway, just like Stannis was. This isn&rsquo;t a certainty that she WILL make the wrong\nchoice, but it certainly sets up that she will face a choice.</p><p>See, Game of Thrones is big on the &lsquo;all actions have\nconsequences&rsquo; thing. Robb died for breaking his vow, Ned died because he was\ntoo honorable and foolish in a dishonorable place. Oberyn died because he was\ntoo set on his perfect vengeance. Tywin died because he was a dick to his son.\nStannis died because he burned his daughter alive. And Rickon died because he\ndidn&rsquo;t run in a zig zag (Too soon? Too soon). Whatever theory you subscribe to,\nI think it&rsquo;s clear that Daenerys will face a major choice in season 8 that will\nhave major consequences.</p><p>Going back to Stannis for a minute: it is also Stannis who\nshows us the not so great nature of fire. This is the basis for a lot of Dark!\nDany theorists reasoning. Fire has never been portrayed as the good element\nthat fights off the evil ice. It has many times been shown in a negative light.\nStannis burning people for his religion, the wild fire that Tyrion uses on the\nBlackwater and Cersei uses to blow up the sept. Fire and ice have both been\ndestructive forces throughout. One is not better than the other. So people who\nbelieve in this theory see fire and ice not as opposing forces but as two equal\nthreats about to descend on Westeros. This is further backed up by the plot\nstructure of Dany and the white walker&rsquo;s arrival in Westeros. They&rsquo;ve been\npresent since season 1 but have only now arrived in Westeros in season 7 (Dany\nat the beginning and the white walkers at the end). </p><p>Likewise, fans of this theory believe that Dany and Jon have\nbeen paralleled not to show them as lost souls who have found each other but to\nset up two opposing forces that will eventually clash. Two Targaryens who are\nrivals for the throne. This theory focuses a lot on the DIFFERENCES between Jon\nand Daenerys. Jon always seems to struggle with killing people, even those who\ndefy him or actively killed him. He hesitates. He appears visibly uncomfortable.\nDaenerys seems to revel in the sight of people burning, especially later on in\nthe series. There&rsquo;s something satisfied about it. One could easily argue that\nDany is just better at putting on a face than Jon and she is just as disturbed\nby executing people, but if that is the case, the show hasn&rsquo;t shown it as\nclearly. (Note: this could just as easily be a directing/acting problem).</p><p>It&rsquo;s also fair to point out that, while lots of people\nsupporting the first theory ship Jonerys, a lot of people supporting this\ntheory support Jonsa. They see Sansa as a better queen than Daenerys. I don&rsquo;t\nlike to pit female characters against each other, but at the very least, one\ncan say that Sansa is a bit more down to earth because of her many hard earned\nlessons. She thinks more about the practical problems of winter and, as she\nsays to Arya &ldquo;chopping off people&rsquo;s heads is satisfying but it&rsquo;s not a way to\nget them to work together&rdquo;. Execution is not her first inclination. She only\npulls it after someone has truly revealed themselves to be despicable.\nDaenerys, on the other hand, executes men before knowing if they are guilty or\nnot in season five.</p><p>Regardless, those who believe in this theory tend to focus\non Daenerys&rsquo; more sinister acts. Her temper, her desire for vengeance, her fascination\nwith fire. But this does not erase her good deeds either. Trying to end\nslavery, rescuing the weak, locking up her dragons after she finds out that\nthey are causing problems. Again: she&rsquo;s a grey character. The difference\nbetween the dark vs light Dany theory is that one side believes her darker acts\nare ultimately the most significant to her arc and the light side believes her\ngood acts are ultimately the most significant part of her arc.</p><p>But again, Daenerys, up until now has been pitted against\nnameless faces. So how is she framed when she is put up against characters we\nknow and love? Particularly, long time antagonist house: The Lannisters.</p><p>The attack on the Lannisters is one of the most fascinating\nscenes in the whole show to me. Because put aside the fact that yes, Daenerys\nis attacking soldiers opposing her in war. Put aside the fact that she is\nrefusing to attack innocent civilians. Put aside the fact that many viewers are\nrooting for her and she is way more popular than most of the Lannisters. This\nscene frames Daenerys as the antagonist. </p><p>The camera primarily focuses on three characters: Jaime,\nBronn and Tyrion. We do not follow Daenerys as she sweeps down upon her\nenemies. We follow the Lannisters watching in horror as she arrives. This is\nlike the Huns coming over the ridge in Mulan (no really, it&rsquo;s introduced almost\nthe exact same way). We zoom in on Jaime and Bronn&rsquo;s stunned expressions. We\nalso focus on Dickon&rsquo;s horror as well. The camera lingers on the bodies of\nsoldiers crumbling to ash. It lingers on Tyrion, looking on, astounded by the\nlevel of destruction that can be wrought by the dragon. But he&rsquo;s seeing the men\nwho serve his family dying. He&rsquo;s worried for his brother.</p><p>There is no sense of joy in Daenerys&rsquo; victory here. We don&rsquo;t\ncut to her after the battle, feeling satisfied. We cut to Tyrion wandering\nthrough the ashes of Westeros soldiers, looking absolutely devastated. And even\nthough Sam&rsquo;s dad is a dick, his death alongside his son is still framed in this\nreally gruesome way. Tyrion is the point of view character through all of this.\nWe feel distant from Daenerys in this scene. What is she thinking? What is her\nmotive? But she is separate from the others, which is a classic way to frame a\nvillain in film. </p><p>And her soldiers? They are a faceless threat. We don&rsquo;t have\nany Dothraki soldiers who we know and love. The show didn&rsquo;t bother giving any\nof them personalities which could be an error in the writing or something but I\ndon&rsquo;t know. In the Unsullied, we know Grey worm, and he&rsquo;s not even in this\nbattle. Contrast this with the scene we got with the Ed Sheeren Lannister\nsoldiers in episode one&ndash;a shockingly nice moment where we see the normal\npeople of Westeros just trying to get through their lives. It&rsquo;s significant\nthat it forces Arya to recognize some of the Lannisters as human and then they\nprobably got cooked in that battle. We do not get any such conversations with Daenerys&rsquo;\nsoldiers in this season.</p><p>There are also people who point out Daenerys burning the\nsupplies in this attack&ndash;supplies that would be sorely needed in the winter\ntime. This supports the idea that Daario put forward in a previous episode.\nThat Daenerys is not a ruler made to sit on an iron chair. She is far more\ncomfortable and confident on a dragon. She is a conqueror. And conquerors do\nnot always have the foresight to plan for the future. They sweep in, they\ndestroy, they leave ashes in their wake. One could argue that this was what\nDany did in Essos. She certainly didn&rsquo;t establish a stable system of government\nin Mereen before she left for the real goal: Westeros. And for all of those\nreasons, those who subscribe to the Dark Dany theory do not think that she\nshould be given the throne as a reward. They think she will die a conqueror,\nunable to give up her ambition for the greater good. She will go too far and\nsuffer the consequences.</p><p>Now, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that all three of these theories\nI&rsquo;ve mentioned have flaws. Those who love Daenerys and want to see her on the\nthrone often ignore her good qualities while those who want to see Dany as an\nantagonist often ignore her bad qualities. The character is often reduced into\na simplistic binary of good vs evil, which is not what this show is about. The &lsquo;Dany\nwill get the throne&rsquo; crowd ignores the idea that the ending of Game of Thrones\nwill be &ldquo;unexpected&rdquo; and &ldquo;bittersweet&rdquo; and the fact that George does not like\npredictable happily ever afters. </p><p>Meanwhile those who think Daenerys will go dark assume a\nHUGE amount of intentionality on the parts of the showrunners. They assume any\nlack of chemistry between Jon and Daenerys, any darker expression from\nDaenerys, and the framing of the attack on the Lannisters are intentional\nchoices. Some of this stuff could be errors in directing, writing and acting.\nCertainly, the showrunners have never been perfect. Just look at the dumb as\nhell Arya and Sansa plot that they wrote for season seven. So it&rsquo;s just as\nlikely that some of this &ldquo;foreshadowing&rdquo; is an error that will go\nunacknowledged in the final season.</p><p>Whatever the case, there is room for reasonable doubt and\nthat doubt will only be settled by season 8. It&rsquo;s going to be controversial no\nmatter what happens, but I wanted to make this post to show the perspective of\nall sides. And, perhaps, to foster courteous discussion. You can start fights\nin the notes if you want, but try to keep it classy. I think it&rsquo;s great that we\nall love a show so much to do so much analyzing of its content. At this point,\nthere&rsquo;s enough evidence to support all three theories and none of them are &ldquo;delusional&rdquo;.\nYou may not like some of the theories. They might conflict with your personal\nbeliefs about the show. But there&rsquo;s not one way this thing could end.</p><p>So, yeah, if you have opinions, let me know. I know that I didn&rsquo;t get to all of the parallels. Like, I barely brushed the surface. This is meant to be an overview, not a deep dive. But again, keep\nit casual. I&rsquo;m not going to be fighting with any trolls. Besides, none of you\neven know which side I&rsquo;m on so you could be starting a fight over nothing!</p><p>I&rsquo;ll probably be writing one of these on the other main\ncharacters eventually. I might even&ndash;if I&rsquo;m feeling very bold&ndash;tackle the\nJonerys vs Jonsa debate. Lord help me if I do.</p>",

        "question": "Did you notice when they cut to Dan\u2019s scene at the Pit in dance of dragons right after Shireen\u2019s burning. There\u2019s another one in S6E4 where Sansa convinces Jon to take back Winterfell, before cutting to Dany in Vaes Dothrak. Both women were threatened to be gang r*ped. Both wanted to take back what\u2019s theirs. Dany united the dothrakis after burning the Khals. Sansa wanted to unite the Houses through honour and LOYALTY to the Starks. Ok maybe not a fair comparison but still, thoughts?",
        "answer": "<p>That\u2019s a really interesting observation, nonny. I\u2019m going to break it down into 2 parts, because you\u2019re talking about two different parallels. There\u2019s a parallel between D*ny and Stannis and also one between D*ny and Sansa.\u00a0</p><p><b>D*ny/Stannis:\u00a0</b></p><p>I think you noticing this transition between the scene of Shireen\u2019s burning to D*ny in the Fighting Pits is part of a larger parallel between D*ny and Stannis that actually started with the first scene where Stannis was introduced to the audience.\u00a0</p><p>The last scene we have in season 1 is the scene where D*ny hatches her dragons from Khal Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The very first scene we have in season 2 is of Stannis pulling out\u00a0\u201cLightbringer\u201d from a funeral pyre of his own, a pyre erected in order to burn the Gods of the Seven, under the same red comet that hailed the birth of the dragons. The scenes are also similar in construction because of the sandy location as well as the night time scenery (not to mention all that fire). However, unlike the majestic feel of the D*ny scenes, the Stannis scene is, quite frankly, ho-hum and much ado about nothing. That\u2019s because Stannis is doing all of this for propaganda purposes while D*ny is actually imbued with magic that ends with her hatching living dragons from stone.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0I think this sets D*ny and Stannis up on a parallel journey, where they both mirror each other as well as act as foils.\u00a0</p><p>The main reason for this set up, I believe, is the fact that Melisandra hails Stannis as Azor Ahai reborn. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has a fantastic series of metas that make a very compelling case that D*ny is in fact Azor Ahai reborn.\u00a0</p><p>Going on the basis of that theory, Stannis, as a pretender to that title, must act as her foil. And in many ways he does:\u00a0</p><p>- Where D*ny becomes more and more of a mythical character, Stannis remains painfully human and not at all magical</p><p>- Where D*ny gains success after success once she has the dragons, Stannis stumbles from one failure to another</p><p>- Where Stannis fails time and time again to garner the support of people, D*ny is hailed and revered as Mysha</p><p>- Where D*ny believes her own hype and comes to think of herself as a large than life character, Stannis doesn\u2019t. He uses Melisandra\u2019s powers to achieve his goals, is certainly more willing to believe in the Azor Ahai story once presented with the threat beyond the wall, but he never truly believes himself to be anything other that a man</p><p>- This bares repeating but D*ny needed people to jump through increasingly narrow loops in order to march North against the WW, whereas Stannis marched his armies beyond the Wall willingly, after receiving a distress signal from the NW.\u00a0</p><p>But \u2026 the truly interesting part in all of this is just how similar Stannis and D*ny are if one were to look a bit more closely at both their characters.\u00a0</p><p>People tend to hold a great deal of affection for D*ny and use all sorts of justifications in order to do away with her more unsavory actions but they don\u2019t really do the same for Stannis. That\u2019s because, I believe, Stannis is a very rigid, cold type of person who unfortunately does not possess charisma, unlike D*ny. This is a commentary that applies in story as well as out of it. Stannis is such a disliked character in show that people would much rather rally behind Renly, a man without a good claim to the throne as well complete lack of a resume that would justify his campaign, because they think he\u2019s a nice guy and, incidentally, think that Stannis is an unlikable stick in the mud.</p><p>Also, unlike D*ny, the author doesn\u2019t pay Stannis the courtesy of giving him easy to hate villains. No baby murdering maegi for Stannis, no slavers to crucify. Instead he gets his likeable brother, everyone\u2019s favorite Lannister and Mance, the king beyond the Wall who is just trying to get his people to safety. Hard to like Stannis after that \u2026\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>However, if you just look beyond those constructions, what is revealed is a man that is trying very hard to do what he believes is the right thing to do.\u00a0\n\nStannis is, in many ways, the closest representation of who I think Richard III was, despite the most obvious play of Tyrion as Richard. \n\n</p><p>He is a creature of duty, not a luster for power. He calls his bannermen and marches to battle not because he\u2019s an evil man trying to destroy Tyrion\u2019s great setup as the Hand of the King, but rather because the reveal of the bastardy of his brother\u2019s children means that he is the rightful king to the throne and he has a duty to see that through as the remaining Baratheon who can carry on the legacy of his family.\u00a0</p><p>That to me is very similar to D*ny\u2019s own motivation for taking back the Iron Throne. She is the last living Targaryen (as far as she knows) and it is her duty and her right to get back the 7 kingdoms. Both of them even use the same term to refer to their enemies,\u00a0\u201cusurpers\u201d. They also both get given kinslaying incidents and also third parties to do the slaying for them.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s also the similarities between Stannis\u2019\u00a0\u201c We go forward. Only forward\u201d and D*ny\u2019s\u00a0\u201cIf I look back I\u2019m lost\u201d but since D*ny never says this in the TV show it\u2019s more of an aside than anything.\u00a0</p><p>However justified their cause was initially, what really dooms both these characters is their willingness to compromise their morals and values in order to get what they want.\u00a0</p><p>A few examples:</p><p>- Stannis is a fiercely loyal man who sees cheating on his wife as dishonorable but gives into having sex with Melisandra so he can have a shadow baby; even wants to do it again after the battle of the Blackwater</p><p>- D*ny hates being traded like a broodmare by her brother but proposes that the Dothraki take as wives the lamb women that they raped.\u00a0</p><p>- Stannis prides himself on his prowess in battle and his strategic abilities but resorts to having a shadow stab his brother in the back</p><p>- D*ny wants to free all slaves but thinks nothing about forcing her prisoner into a marriage that will suit her purposes, while holding him captive</p><p>Both their stories build up over time, starting with seemingly small compromises at first, while growing and growing until we reach the end of their arcs. One of the ways in which you can really track this decent is through the eyes of their advisors. In many ways, Barristan Selmy and Jorah Mormont are the Ser Davos in D*ny\u2019s story. And just like Stannis starts listening to Davos less and less, so does D*ny who continously ignores Jorah\u2019s advice and only marginally pays lip service to Barristan\u2019s words of wisdom.\u00a0</p><p>The transition you mentioned is a very significant one because it marks the end of Stannis\u2019 story and the start of the last part of D*ny\u2019s story. Stannis\u2019 entire arc hinges on the burning of Shireen. Whatever moral grounds and justification he might have had up until that point is lost the moment he burns his own daughter at the stake. And it\u2019s also pointless, again reminding everyone that he is in fact not Azor Ahai at all but rather a man that completely lost grasp of the situation and ended up relying on the words of a misguided witch.\u00a0</p><p>D*ny flying on Drogon from the Fighting Pits really marks the point where she essentially abandons the things she says she cares about in favor of the fire and blood policy that will become prevalent in her story moving forward.\u00a0</p><p>Gone are the days of the D*ny that wants to rule wisely in Meereen, hello D*ny on top of her dragon burning down the Yunkai fleet and abandoning her city in favor of <strike>her</strike> <strike>pipe dream in</strike>\u00a0Westeros. Gone are the days of the girl horrified of the revelation that Drogon is burning little girls alive and that leads her to locking her remaining 2 dragons up. Hello Field of Fire 2.0, the burning of Vaes Dothrak and\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>D*ny: They filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them up in here.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>That being said, the similarities between these two really come into the forefront in season 7 when D*ny ends up playing Stannis to Jon\u2019s Mance, complete with threats of\u00a0\u201copen rebellion\u201d,\u00a0\u201cbend the knee\u201d requests and this:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"674\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc9f5bd46e3dd9620353504cbe244943/tumblr_inline_pipnu7ECCl1ufeb46_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"674\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"330\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c38ed32cd8507a80a077dd175d6ff2b6/tumblr_inline_pipnuhUcKv1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"330\"/></figure><p>We aslo get another Stannis/Davos dynamic, this time with D*ny/Tyrion where D*ny becomes increasingly antagonistic and mistrustful of Tyrion as his plans don\u2019t bare fruits, she loses patience and he counsels against extreme usage of violence. It\u2019s an almost play by play of season 4 and 5 Stannis and Davos.\u00a0</p><p><b>D*ny/Sansa:\u00a0</b></p><p>Here again I have to bring another meta recommendation\u00a0since <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> already wrote a meta on the treatment of D*ny/Cersei/Sansa as foils.\u00a0</p><p>To me, the D*ny/Sansa mirroring is the opposite of D*ny/Stannis. Where the later start of as foils and then begin to be more and more similar to each other as the story progresses, D*ny/Sansa start off as rather smiliar:\u00a0</p><p>- they\u2019re both pawns in the machinations of their families (Ned/Robert; Viserys/Illyrio)</p><p>- they\u2019re both young, naive and unprepared for the world they\u2019re entering</p><p>- they\u2019re both lusted over by much older men</p><p>- they both find ways to survive the dire circumstances they\u2019re thrown into</p><p>However, there is one thing that marks the transition of this dynamic from a parallel into foil territory and that is the relationship with their husband/betrothed. D*ny manages to change Drogo from her abuser to her loving husband. Sansa fails to do that and ends up a victim of Joffrey. This is, partly, the reason why people hate Sansa so much and find her useless, even more so after the introduction of her other foil, Maergery. If D*ny manages to completely alter her dynamic with Drogo and if Maergery succedes in placating Joffrey, why is Sansa so stupid and useless and continues to be abused?\u00a0</p><p>They fail to take into account that Drogo is a warlord of a very violent culture but not actually a psychopath and that Maergery manages to keep Joffrey\u2019s tendencies at bay for a time. If she had ended up married to the little monster, in time she would have met with a gruesome death because psychopaths like Joffrey can\u2019t be changed, they can only be entertained momentarily.\u00a0</p><p>Things become even more dire for Sansa when D*ny gets her dragons. Because while D*ny is there conquering cities, bending men to her will and essentially doing whatever the hell she likes, Sansa is still stuck in an unrelenting cycle of abuse that culminates in her marriage to Ramsay. It isn\u2019t that Sansa doesn\u2019t have some wins along the way but they fail in comparison to what D*ny achieves.\u00a0</p><p>Now, getting back to this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nS6E4 where Sansa convinces Jon to take back Winterfell, before cutting to Dany in Vaes Dothrak. Both women were threatened to be gang r*ped. Both wanted to take back what\u2019s theirs. Dany united the dothrakis after burning the Khals. Sansa wanted to unite the Houses through honour and LOYALTY to the Starks. \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>I have no doubt that this transition was intentional as was the superficial similarities between the two situations.</p><p>Both Sansa and D*ny are presented with a similar outcome: submit and potentially suffer gang raping and death or try to fight. But they are in slightly different circumstances:\u00a0</p><p>For one, Sansa is not alone in all of this. Jon is in it, as well. Not to mention Ramsay has Rickon. On top of all of that, the North as a whole is suffering under the rule of Ramsay, the guy that goes to people\u2019s castles and flays them alive. The wildlings are at risk as well as Ramsay will most likely decimate them if they don\u2019t fight back.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s all to say that it\u2019s not just Sansa that is in dire circumstances but they\u2019re all in it together and need to figure out a way to fight if they want to stay alive. Sansa isn\u2019t dragging all these people into her own personal vendetta, the way D*ny does with the Dothraki.\u00a0</p><p>The burning of the khals themselves seems like an inevitable choice by D*ny given the situation she finds herself in. But what she does after, isn\u2019t. She essentially recruits the Dothraki in her own personal khalasaar so she can march to Westeros and take back the 7 kingdoms. She could have just gone back to Meereen and left those people in peace.\u00a0</p><p>Also, important to note the outcome of these two situations. The Battle of the Batards marks a redressing of balance in the North. Jon and Sansa don\u2019t change the Northerner\u2019s way of life when they take back Winterfell. Quite the opposite. They relieve them of an oppressor.\u00a0</p><p>D*ny, on the other hand, burns down the Dothraki\u2019s most sacred site and then drags them off with her over the Narrow Sea. Depending on the way her Westerosi campaign ends, the Dothraki might find themselves on the verge of extinction.\u00a0</p><p>\n\n I\u2019m going to go back to GRRM saying that human beings have in them both the ability to do good as well as the ability to do evil and that it\u2019s really individual choices that marks the difference. I will also add that the people you choose to surround yourself with are also important, as they will be able to stay your worse impulses if needs be.\u00a0</p><p>For example, Jon does this in the Alys/Ned situation where Sansa\u2019s instinct would have been to relieve those children of their homes instead of giving them a chance to prove their loyalty. But because she has a partner at her side and she isn\u2019t alone in all of this, she is spared that mistake. Not only that but, through Jon\u2019s example, she begins to change her world view and to start valuing collaboration and understanding over the merciless crushing of real or imagined enemies that LF and Cersei tried to drill into her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Dany doesn\u2019t have that luxury. For one, she\u2019s increasingly unwilling to listen to her advisers, even though they are all essentially telling her the same thing: <i>violence won\u2019t get you anything in the long run. Control your lust for fire and blood.\u00a0</i></p><p>Her other problem is that because of the cult like status she has achieved as Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains etc., she\u2019s no longer just a person for the people that surround her. She\u2019s become a God-like figure that is worshiped. Being worshiped sounds great in theory but in reality you end up isolated, in an eco chamber that will only validate your own beliefs and with people that won\u2019t be able to give you any kind of objective advice because they are unable to see your actions as potentially negative or problematic. In essence, D*ny is slowly losing people\u2019s ability to question her. And that\u2019s a really bad thing.\u00a0</p><p>Well, nonny, you asked for my thoughts and I guess I had a lot of them. :)</p><p>Thank you for the ask!</p><p><i>* none of the art if mine</i></p>",

D*ny manages to change Drogo from her abuser to her loving husband. Sansa fails to do that and ends up a victim of Joffrey. This is, partly, the reason why people hate Sansa so much and find her useless, even more so after the introduction of her other foil, Maergery. If D*ny manages to completely alter her dynamic with Drogo and if Maergery succedes in placating Joffrey, why is Sansa so stupid and useless and continues to be abused?\u00a0</p><p>They fail to take into account that Drogo is a warlord of a very violent culture but not actually a psychopath and that Maergery manages to keep Joffrey\u2019s tendencies at bay for a time. If she had ended up married to the little monster, in time she would have met with a gruesome death because psychopaths like Joffrey can\u2019t be changed, they can only be entertained momentarily.\u00a0</p><p>Things become even more dire for Sansa when D*ny gets her dragons. Because while D*ny is there conquering cities, bending men to her will and essentially doing whatever the hell she likes, Sansa is still stuck in an unrelenting cycle of abuse that culminates in her marriage to Ramsay. It isn\u2019t that Sansa doesn\u2019t have some wins along the way but they fail in comparison to what D*ny achieves.\u00a0</p><p>Now, getting back to this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nS6E4 where Sansa convinces Jon to take back Winterfell, before cutting to Dany in Vaes Dothrak. Both women were threatened to be gang r*ped. Both wanted to take back what\u2019s theirs. Dany united the dothrakis after burning the Khals. Sansa wanted to unite the Houses through honour and LOYALTY to the Starks. \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I have no doubt that this transition was intentional as was the superficial similarities between the two situations.</p><p>Both Sansa and D*ny are presented with a similar outcome: submit and potentially suffer gang raping and death or try to fight. But they are in slightly different circumstances:\u00a0</p><p>For one, Sansa is not alone in all of this. Jon is in it, as well. Not to mention Ramsay has Rickon. On top of all of that, the North as a whole is suffering under the rule of Ramsay, the guy that goes to people\u2019s castles and flays them alive. The wildlings are at risk as well as Ramsay will most likely decimate them if they don\u2019t fight back.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s all to say that it\u2019s not just Sansa that is in dire circumstances but they\u2019re all in it together and need to figure out a way to fight if they want to stay alive. Sansa isn\u2019t dragging all these people into her own personal vendetta, the way D*ny does with the Dothraki.\u00a0</p><p>The burning of the khals themselves seems like an inevitable choice by D*ny given the situation she finds herself in. But what she does after, isn\u2019t. She essentially recruits the Dothraki in her own personal khalasaar so she can march to Westeros and take back the 7 kingdoms. She could have just gone back to Meereen and left those people in peace.\u00a0</p><p>Also, important to note the outcome of these two situations. The Battle of the Batards marks a redressing of balance in the North. Jon and Sansa don\u2019t change the Northerner\u2019s way of life when they take back Winterfell. Quite the opposite. They relieve them of an oppressor.\u00a0</p><p>D*ny, on the other hand, burns down the Dothraki\u2019s most sacred site and then drags them off with her over the Narrow Sea. Depending on the way her Westerosi campaign ends, the Dothraki might find themselves on the verge of extinction.\u00a0</p><p>\n\n I\u2019m going to go back to GRRM saying that human beings have in them both the ability to do good as well as the ability to do evil and that it\u2019s really individual choices that marks the difference. I will also add that the people you choose to surround yourself with are also important, as they will be able to stay your worse impulses if needs be.\u00a0</p><p>For example, Jon does this in the Alys/Ned situation where Sansa\u2019s instinct would have been to relieve those children of their homes instead of giving them a chance to prove their loyalty. But because she has a partner at her side and she isn\u2019t alone in all of this, she is spared that mistake. Not only that but, through Jon\u2019s example, she begins to change her world view and to start valuing collaboration and understanding over the merciless crushing of real or imagined enemies that LF and Cersei tried to drill into her.\u00a0<br></p><p>Dany doesn\u2019t have that luxury. For one, she\u2019s increasingly unwilling to listen to her advisers, even though they are all essentially telling her the same thing: <i>violence won\u2019t get you anything in the long run. Control your lust for fire and blood.\u00a0</i></p><p>Her other problem is that because of the cult like status she has achieved as Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains etc., she\u2019s no longer just a person for the people that surround her. She\u2019s become a God-like figure that is worshiped. Being worshiped sounds great in theory but in reality you end up isolated, in an eco chamber that will only validate your own beliefs and with people that won\u2019t be able to give you any kind of objective advice because they are unable to see your actions as potentially negative or problematic. In essence, D*ny is slowly losing people\u2019s ability to question her. And that\u2019s a really bad thing.\u00a0</p><p>Well, nonny, you asked for my thoughts and I guess I had a lot of them. :)</p><p>Thank you for the ask!</p><p><i>* none of the art if mine</i></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>That\u2019s a really interesting observation, nonny. I\u2019m going to break it down into 2 parts, because you\u2019re talking about two different parallels. There\u2019s a parallel between D*ny and Stannis and also one between D*ny and Sansa.\u00a0</p><p><b>D*ny/Stannis:\u00a0</b></p><p>I think you noticing this transition between the scene of Shireen\u2019s burning to D*ny in the Fighting Pits is part of a larger parallel between D*ny and Stannis that actually started with the first scene where Stannis was introduced to the audience.\u00a0</p><p>The last scene we have in season 1 is the scene where D*ny hatches her dragons from Khal Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre.\u00a0<br></p><p>The very first scene we have in season 2 is of Stannis pulling out\u00a0\u201cLightbringer\u201d from a funeral pyre of his own, a pyre erected in order to burn the Gods of the Seven, under the same red comet that hailed the birth of the dragons. The scenes are also similar in construction because of the sandy location as well as the night time scenery (not to mention all that fire). However, unlike the majestic feel of the D*ny scenes, the Stannis scene is, quite frankly, ho-hum and much ado about nothing. That\u2019s because Stannis is doing all of this for propaganda purposes while D*ny is actually imbued with magic that ends with her hatching living dragons from stone.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0I think this sets D*ny and Stannis up on a parallel journey, where they both mirror each other as well as act as foils.\u00a0</p><p>The main reason for this set up, I believe, is the fact that Melisandra hails Stannis as Azor Ahai reborn. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has a fantastic series of metas that make a very compelling case that D*ny is in fact Azor Ahai reborn.\u00a0</p><p>Going on the basis of that theory, Stannis, as a pretender to that title, must act as her foil. And in many ways he does:\u00a0</p><p>- Where D*ny becomes more and more of a mythical character, Stannis remains painfully human and not at all magical</p><p>- Where D*ny gains success after success once she has the dragons, Stannis stumbles from one failure to another</p><p>- Where Stannis fails time and time again to garner the support of people, D*ny is hailed and revered as Mysha</p><p>- Where D*ny believes her own hype and comes to think of herself as a large than life character, Stannis doesn\u2019t. He uses Melisandra\u2019s powers to achieve his goals, is certainly more willing to believe in the Azor Ahai story once presented with the threat beyond the wall, but he never truly believes himself to be anything other that a man</p><p>- This bares repeating but D*ny needed people to jump through increasingly narrow loops in order to march North against the WW, whereas Stannis marched his armies beyond the Wall willingly, after receiving a distress signal from the NW.\u00a0</p><p>But \u2026 the truly interesting part in all of this is just how similar Stannis and D*ny are if one were to look a bit more closely at both their characters.\u00a0</p><p>People tend to hold a great deal of affection for D*ny and use all sorts of justifications in order to do away with her more unsavory actions but they don\u2019t really do the same for Stannis. That\u2019s because, I believe, Stannis is a very rigid, cold type of person who unfortunately does not possess charisma, unlike D*ny. This is a commentary that applies in story as well as out of it. Stannis is such a disliked character in show that people would much rather rally behind Renly, a man without a good claim to the throne as well complete lack of a resume that would justify his campaign, because they think he\u2019s a nice guy and, incidentally, think that Stannis is an unlikable stick in the mud.</p><p>Also, unlike D*ny, the author doesn\u2019t pay Stannis the courtesy of giving him easy to hate villains. No baby murdering maegi for Stannis, no slavers to crucify. Instead he gets his likeable brother, everyone\u2019s favorite Lannister and Mance, the king beyond the Wall who is just trying to get his people to safety. Hard to like Stannis after that \u2026\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>However, if you just look beyond those constructions, what is revealed is a man that is trying very hard to do what he believes is the right thing to do.\u00a0\n\nStannis is, in many ways, the closest representation of who I think Richard III was, despite the most obvious play of Tyrion as Richard. \n\n</p><p>He is a creature of duty, not a luster for power. He calls his bannermen and marches to battle not because he\u2019s an evil man trying to destroy Tyrion\u2019s great setup as the Hand of the King, but rather because the reveal of the bastardy of his brother\u2019s children means that he is the rightful king to the throne and he has a duty to see that through as the remaining Baratheon who can carry on the legacy of his family.\u00a0</p><p>That to me is very similar to D*ny\u2019s own motivation for taking back the Iron Throne. She is the last living Targaryen (as far as she knows) and it is her duty and her right to get back the 7 kingdoms. Both of them even use the same term to refer to their enemies,\u00a0\u201cusurpers\u201d. They also both get given kinslaying incidents and also third parties to do the slaying for them.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s also the similarities between Stannis\u2019\u00a0\u201c We go forward. Only forward\u201d and D*ny\u2019s\u00a0\u201cIf I look back I\u2019m lost\u201d but since D*ny never says this in the TV show it\u2019s more of an aside than anything.\u00a0</p><p>However justified their cause was initially, what really dooms both these characters is their willingness to compromise their morals and values in order to get what they want.\u00a0</p><p>A few examples:</p><p>- Stannis is a fiercely loyal man who sees cheating on his wife as dishonorable but gives into having sex with Melisandra so he can have a shadow baby; even wants to do it again after the battle of the Blackwater</p><p>- D*ny hates being traded like a broodmare by her brother but proposes that the Dothraki take as wives the lamb women that they raped.\u00a0</p><p>- Stannis prides himself on his prowess in battle and his strategic abilities but resorts to having a shadow stab his brother in the back</p><p>- D*ny wants to free all slaves but thinks nothing about forcing her prisoner into a marriage that will suit her purposes, while holding him captive</p><p>Both their stories build up over time, starting with seemingly small compromises at first, while growing and growing until we reach the end of their arcs. One of the ways in which you can really track this decent is through the eyes of their advisors. In many ways, Barristan Selmy and Jorah Mormont are the Ser Davos in D*ny\u2019s story. And just like Stannis starts listening to Davos less and less, so does D*ny who continously ignores Jorah\u2019s advice and only marginally pays lip service to Barristan\u2019s words of wisdom.\u00a0</p><p>The transition you mentioned is a very significant one because it marks the end of Stannis\u2019 story and the start of the last part of D*ny\u2019s story. Stannis\u2019 entire arc hinges on the burning of Shireen. Whatever moral grounds and justification he might have had up until that point is lost the moment he burns his own daughter at the stake. And it\u2019s also pointless, again reminding everyone that he is in fact not Azor Ahai at all but rather a man that completely lost grasp of the situation and ended up relying on the words of a misguided witch.\u00a0</p><p>D*ny flying on Drogon from the Fighting Pits really marks the point where she essentially abandons the things she says she cares about in favor of the fire and blood policy that will become prevalent in her story moving forward.\u00a0</p><p>Gone are the days of the D*ny that wants to rule wisely in Meereen, hello D*ny on top of her dragon burning down the Yunkai fleet and abandoning her city in favor of <strike>her</strike> <strike>pipe dream in</strike>\u00a0Westeros. Gone are the days of the girl horrified of the revelation that Drogon is burning little girls alive and that leads her to locking her remaining 2 dragons up. Hello Field of Fire 2.0, the burning of Vaes Dothrak and\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>D*ny: They filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them up in here.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>That being said, the similarities between these two really come into the forefront in season 7 when D*ny ends up playing Stannis to Jon\u2019s Mance, complete with threats of\u00a0\u201copen rebellion\u201d,\u00a0\u201cbend the knee\u201d requests and this:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"674\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc9f5bd46e3dd9620353504cbe244943/tumblr_inline_pipnu7ECCl1ufeb46_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"674\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"330\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c38ed32cd8507a80a077dd175d6ff2b6/tumblr_inline_pipnuhUcKv1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"330\"></figure><p>We aslo get another Stannis/Davos dynamic, this time with D*ny/Tyrion where D*ny becomes increasingly antagonistic and mistrustful of Tyrion as his plans don\u2019t bare fruits, she loses patience and he counsels against extreme usage of violence. It\u2019s an almost play by play of season 4 and 5 Stannis and Davos.\u00a0</p><p><b>D*ny/Sansa:\u00a0</b></p><p>Here again I have to bring another meta recommendation\u00a0since <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> already wrote a meta on the treatment of D*ny/Cersei/Sansa as foils.\u00a0</p><p>To me, the D*ny/Sansa mirroring is the opposite of D*ny/Stannis.

That&rsquo;s because Stannis is doing all of this for propaganda purposes while D*ny is actually imbued with magic that ends with her hatching living dragons from stone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I think this sets D*ny and Stannis up on a parallel journey, where they both mirror each other as well as act as foils.&nbsp;</p><p>The main reason for this set up, I believe, is the fact that Melisandra hails Stannis as Azor Ahai reborn. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has a fantastic series of metas that make a very compelling case that D*ny is in fact Azor Ahai reborn.&nbsp;</p><p>Going on the basis of that theory, Stannis, as a pretender to that title, must act as her foil. And in many ways he does:&nbsp;</p><p>- Where D*ny becomes more and more of a mythical character, Stannis remains painfully human and not at all magical</p><p>- Where D*ny gains success after success once she has the dragons, Stannis stumbles from one failure to another</p><p>- Where Stannis fails time and time again to garner the support of people, D*ny is hailed and revered as Mysha</p><p>- Where D*ny believes her own hype and comes to think of herself as a large than life character, Stannis doesn&rsquo;t. He uses Melisandra&rsquo;s powers to achieve his goals, is certainly more willing to believe in the Azor Ahai story once presented with the threat beyond the wall, but he never truly believes himself to be anything other that a man</p><p>- This bares repeating but D*ny needed people to jump through increasingly narrow loops in order to march North against the WW, whereas Stannis marched his armies beyond the Wall willingly, after receiving a distress signal from the NW.&nbsp;</p><p>But &hellip; the truly interesting part in all of this is just how similar Stannis and D*ny are if one were to look a bit more closely at both their characters.&nbsp;</p><p>People tend to hold a great deal of affection for D*ny and use all sorts of justifications in order to do away with her more unsavory actions but they don&rsquo;t really do the same for Stannis. That&rsquo;s because, I believe, Stannis is a very rigid, cold type of person who unfortunately does not possess charisma, unlike D*ny. This is a commentary that applies in story as well as out of it. Stannis is such a disliked character in show that people would much rather rally behind Renly, a man without a good claim to the throne as well complete lack of a resume that would justify his campaign, because they think he&rsquo;s a nice guy and, incidentally, think that Stannis is an unlikable stick in the mud.</p><p>Also, unlike D*ny, the author doesn&rsquo;t pay Stannis the courtesy of giving him easy to hate villains. No baby murdering maegi for Stannis, no slavers to crucify. Instead he gets his likeable brother, everyone&rsquo;s favorite Lannister and Mance, the king beyond the Wall who is just trying to get his people to safety. Hard to like Stannis after that &hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, if you just look beyond those constructions, what is revealed is a man that is trying very hard to do what he believes is the right thing to do.&nbsp;\n\nStannis is, in many ways, the closest representation of who I think Richard III was, despite the most obvious play of Tyrion as Richard. \n\n</p><p>He is a creature of duty, not a luster for power. He calls his bannermen and marches to battle not because he&rsquo;s an evil man trying to destroy Tyrion&rsquo;s great setup as the Hand of the King, but rather because the reveal of the bastardy of his brother&rsquo;s children means that he is the rightful king to the throne and he has a duty to see that through as the remaining Baratheon who can carry on the legacy of his family.&nbsp;</p><p>That to me is very similar to D*ny&rsquo;s own motivation for taking back the Iron Throne. She is the last living Targaryen (as far as she knows) and it is her duty and her right to get back the 7 kingdoms. Both of them even use the same term to refer to their enemies,&nbsp;&ldquo;usurpers&rdquo;. They also both get given kinslaying incidents and also third parties to do the slaying for them.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s also the similarities between Stannis&rsquo;&nbsp;&ldquo; We go forward. Only forward&rdquo; and D*ny&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;If I look back I&rsquo;m lost&rdquo; but since D*ny never says this in the TV show it&rsquo;s more of an aside than anything.&nbsp;</p><p>However justified their cause was initially, what really dooms both these characters is their willingness to compromise their morals and values in order to get what they want.&nbsp;</p><p>A few examples:</p><p>- Stannis is a fiercely loyal man who sees cheating on his wife as dishonorable but gives into having sex with Melisandra so he can have a shadow baby; even wants to do it again after the battle of the Blackwater</p><p>- D*ny hates being traded like a broodmare by her brother but proposes that the Dothraki take as wives the lamb women that they raped.&nbsp;</p><p>- Stannis prides himself on his prowess in battle and his strategic abilities but resorts to having a shadow stab his brother in the back</p><p>- D*ny wants to free all slaves but thinks nothing about forcing her prisoner into a marriage that will suit her purposes, while holding him captive</p><p>Both their stories build up over time, starting with seemingly small compromises at first, while growing and growing until we reach the end of their arcs. One of the ways in which you can really track this decent is through the eyes of their advisors. In many ways, Barristan Selmy and Jorah Mormont are the Ser Davos in D*ny&rsquo;s story. And just like Stannis starts listening to Davos less and less, so does D*ny who continously ignores Jorah&rsquo;s advice and only marginally pays lip service to Barristan&rsquo;s words of wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>The transition you mentioned is a very significant one because it marks the end of Stannis&rsquo; story and the start of the last part of D*ny&rsquo;s story. Stannis&rsquo; entire arc hinges on the burning of Shireen. Whatever moral grounds and justification he might have had up until that point is lost the moment he burns his own daughter at the stake. And it&rsquo;s also pointless, again reminding everyone that he is in fact not Azor Ahai at all but rather a man that completely lost grasp of the situation and ended up relying on the words of a misguided witch.&nbsp;</p><p>D*ny flying on Drogon from the Fighting Pits really marks the point where she essentially abandons the things she says she cares about in favor of the fire and blood policy that will become prevalent in her story moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Gone are the days of the D*ny that wants to rule wisely in Meereen, hello D*ny on top of her dragon burning down the Yunkai fleet and abandoning her city in favor of <strike>her</strike> <strike>pipe dream in</strike>&nbsp;Westeros. Gone are the days of the girl horrified of the revelation that Drogon is burning little girls alive and that leads her to locking her remaining 2 dragons up. Hello Field of Fire 2.0, the burning of Vaes Dothrak and&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>D*ny: They filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them up in here.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>That being said, the similarities between these two really come into the forefront in season 7 when D*ny ends up playing Stannis to Jon&rsquo;s Mance, complete with threats of&nbsp;&ldquo;open rebellion&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;bend the knee&rdquo; requests and this:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc9f5bd46e3dd9620353504cbe244943/tumblr_inline_pipnu7ECCl1ufeb46_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c38ed32cd8507a80a077dd175d6ff2b6/tumblr_inline_pipnuhUcKv1ufeb46_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>We aslo get another Stannis/Davos dynamic, this time with D*ny/Tyrion where D*ny becomes increasingly antagonistic and mistrustful of Tyrion as his plans don&rsquo;t bare fruits, she loses patience and he counsels against extreme usage of violence. It&rsquo;s an almost play by play of season 4 and 5 Stannis and Davos.&nbsp;</p><p><b>D*ny/Sansa:&nbsp;</b></p><p>Here again I have to bring another meta recommendation&nbsp;since <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> already wrote a meta on the treatment of D*ny/Cersei/Sansa as foils.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, the D*ny/Sansa mirroring is the opposite of D*ny/Stannis. Where the later start of as foils and then begin to be more and more similar to each other as the story progresses, D*ny/Sansa start off as rather smiliar:&nbsp;</p><p>- they&rsquo;re both pawns in the machinations of their families (Ned/Robert; Viserys/Illyrio)</p><p>- they&rsquo;re both young, naive and unprepared for the world they&rsquo;re entering</p><p>- they&rsquo;re both lusted over by much older men</p><p>- they both find ways to survive the dire circumstances they&rsquo;re thrown into</p><p>However, there is one thing that marks the transition of this dynamic from a parallel into foil territory and that is the relationship with their husband/betrothed. D*ny manages to change Drogo from her abuser to her loving husband. Sansa fails to do that and ends up a victim of Joffrey. This is, partly, the reason why people hate Sansa so much and find her useless, even more so after the introduction of her other foil, Maergery. If D*ny manages to completely alter her dynamic with Drogo and if Maergery succedes in placating Joffrey, why is Sansa so stupid and useless and continues to be abused?&nbsp;</p><p>They fail to take into account that Drogo is a warlord of a very violent culture but not actually a psychopath and that Maergery manages to keep Joffrey&rsquo;s tendencies at bay for a time. If she had ended up married to the little monster, in time she would have met with a gruesome death because psychopaths like Joffrey can&rsquo;t be changed, they can only be entertained momentarily.&nbsp;</p><p>Things become even more dire for Sansa when D*ny gets her dragons. Because while D*ny is there conquering cities, bending men to her will and essentially doing whatever the hell she likes, Sansa is still stuck in an unrelenting cycle of abuse that culminates in her marriage to Ramsay. It isn&rsquo;t that Sansa doesn&rsquo;t have some wins along the way but they fail in comparison to what D*ny achieves.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, getting back to this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nS6E4 where Sansa convinces Jon to take back Winterfell, before cutting to Dany in Vaes Dothrak. Both women were threatened to be gang r*ped. Both wanted to take back what&rsquo;s theirs. Dany united the dothrakis after burning the Khals. Sansa wanted to unite the Houses through honour and LOYALTY to the Starks. \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>I have no doubt that this transition was intentional as was the superficial similarities between the two situations.</p><p>Both Sansa and D*ny are presented with a similar outcome: submit and potentially suffer gang raping and death or try to fight. But they are in slightly different circumstances:&nbsp;</p><p>For one, Sansa is not alone in all of this. Jon is in it, as well. Not to mention Ramsay has Rickon. On top of all of that, the North as a whole is suffering under the rule of Ramsay, the guy that goes to people&rsquo;s castles and flays them alive. The wildlings are at risk as well as Ramsay will most likely decimate them if they don&rsquo;t fight back.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s all to say that it&rsquo;s not just Sansa that is in dire circumstances but they&rsquo;re all in it together and need to figure out a way to fight if they want to stay alive. Sansa isn&rsquo;t dragging all these people into her own personal vendetta, the way D*ny does with the Dothraki.&nbsp;</p><p>The burning of the khals themselves seems like an inevitable choice by D*ny given the situation she finds herself in. But what she does after, isn&rsquo;t. She essentially recruits the Dothraki in her own personal khalasaar so she can march to Westeros and take back the 7 kingdoms. She could have just gone back to Meereen and left those people in peace.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, important to note the outcome of these two situations. The Battle of the Batards marks a redressing of balance in the North. Jon and Sansa don&rsquo;t change the Northerner&rsquo;s way of life when they take back Winterfell. Quite the opposite. They relieve them of an oppressor.&nbsp;</p><p>D*ny, on the other hand, burns down the Dothraki&rsquo;s most sacred site and then drags them off with her over the Narrow Sea. Depending on the way her Westerosi campaign ends, the Dothraki might find themselves on the verge of extinction.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\n I&rsquo;m going to go back to GRRM saying that human beings have in them both the ability to do good as well as the ability to do evil and that it&rsquo;s really individual choices that marks the difference. I will also add that the people you choose to surround yourself with are also important, as they will be able to stay your worse impulses if needs be.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Jon does this in the Alys/Ned situation where Sansa&rsquo;s instinct would have been to relieve those children of their homes instead of giving them a chance to prove their loyalty. But because she has a partner at her side and she isn&rsquo;t alone in all of this, she is spared that mistake. Not only that but, through Jon&rsquo;s example, she begins to change her world view and to start valuing collaboration and understanding over the merciless crushing of real or imagined enemies that LF and Cersei tried to drill into her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Dany doesn&rsquo;t have that luxury. For one, she&rsquo;s increasingly unwilling to listen to her advisers, even though they are all essentially telling her the same thing: <i>violence won&rsquo;t get you anything in the long run. Control your lust for fire and blood.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Her other problem is that because of the cult like status she has achieved as Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains etc., she&rsquo;s no longer just a person for the people that surround her. She&rsquo;s become a God-like figure that is worshiped. Being worshiped sounds great in theory but in reality you end up isolated, in an eco chamber that will only validate your own beliefs and with people that won&rsquo;t be able to give you any kind of objective advice because they are unable to see your actions as potentially negative or problematic. In essence, D*ny is slowly losing people&rsquo;s ability to question her. And that&rsquo;s a really bad thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, nonny, you asked for my thoughts and I guess I had a lot of them. :)</p><p>Thank you for the ask!</p><p><i>* none of the art if mine</i></p>",

She straightened up, crossing her arms. &ldquo;You can go to bed, but I&rsquo;d like you to tell me why you lied to your mother first.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; Sansa sank down on the bed and tried not to think about how soft it would be in sleep. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t tell her everything, because she didn&rsquo;t ask. And I didn&rsquo;t offer up that information because if I did, she&rsquo;d freak out. And then you would not come. And then I would spend four days up here being miserable, missing you, fending off creepy Petyr, listening to my mom snark about Talisa&rsquo;s eating and Arya&rsquo;s clothes and my dad&rsquo;s beer gut, and for once in my life I was selfish and I decided not to ask what I want, but I wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would have appreciated knowing the truth,&rdquo; Sandor countered with and Sansa sighed, running her fingers through her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but you would&rsquo;ve told me to do it the right way and ask my mom and then wouldn&rsquo;t have came because you are too good a guy to do such a thing. So I am sorry I didn&rsquo;t tell you everything. Are you mad at me, or can we go to bed?&rdquo; she demanded. Sandor pondered his answer for a couple long moments, before fixing her with a strong gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad, but only because I know you, and I&rsquo;ve also met your mother. But I don&rsquo;t want you to ever lie by omission to me again. Even if you do, I&rsquo;ll know. You&rsquo;re a shit liar, little bird.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Sansa grumbled, thinking about her roommates and teammates and friends, before standing up. She opened her arms and Sandor came, hugging her tightly and kissing her head for good measure.</p>",
