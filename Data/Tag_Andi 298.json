\u00a0reserved for cyrus. those big smiles? reserved for cyrus. the only time we have seen tj be himself are his scenes with cyrus.<br/><br/>tj obviously has a lot to make up for. he definitely needs to apologize to buffy, and from then on he just needs to be nicer to people. however, i notice so many people in the fandom act like he needs to do so much more to prove that he&rsquo;s changed (mainly jyrus shippers..) and no, he really doesn&rsquo;t. tj&rsquo;s storyline with buffy is almost over. all he needs to do is apologize and his arc with her is finished. people are so against tyrus that they convince themselves that tj is worse than he actually is. since becoming friends with cyrus, tj has treated people with so much more respect and kindness, he&rsquo;s shown that he has become a better person. \u00a0in every scene together. that&rsquo;s right, every goddamn scene, tj and cyrus have helped each other grow as people. literally all tj needs to do is apologize to buffy. that&rsquo;s it. he doesn&rsquo;t have to save all of china for him to be completely redeemed.<br/><br/>the fandom has forgiven amber, i haven&rsquo;t seen anyone say anything about everything she&rsquo;s done. amber, while she has shown that she is becoming nicer, has still barely been redeemed at all. what she did was way worse than what tj did to buffy. he just picked on her a little to try and get her to quit the basketball team, while amber straight up emotionally manipulated jonah. but i still see people acting like amber is a saint while tj is the embodiment of all evil. i can one hundred percent say that most people hate tj because he rivals jyrus.<br/><br/>and i can also one hundred percent say that tj has made cyrus happier than jonah beck every will, and that&rsquo;s the real tea.<br/><br/>not to mention that i think having tj be more lgbt rep for the show would be much better than jonah. yes, while i would love to have a bi jonah beck, because bi representation is important, i think tj being lgbt would be more ground breaking.<br/><br/>tj would show kids that you can be masculine and still like the same gender. he would show kids that you can be comfortable with your sexuality and still be a jock. he would show kids that it&rsquo;s okay to have a learning disability while also being lgbt, that it&rsquo;s okay to be different in more than one way. i think that even if he isn&rsquo;t lgbt he is still a good character. tj show kids that people you see as bullies may have deeper things going on, but it&rsquo;s still not okay for them to take it out on others. he shows kids that it&rsquo;s okay to have a learning disability. he shows kids that boys can be emotional and still masculine.<br/><br/>and having tryus be endgame would break SO many stereotypes. even the stereotype they resemble (jock x nerd, they also kind of have a romeo and juliet relationship) is completely different to anything i&rsquo;ve seen. tj isn&rsquo;t scared to be seen with cyrus, he has never made fun of cyrus so he could keep up his reputation. cyrus has never had to change himself for tj to like or notice him. cyrus hasn&rsquo;t been hopelessly pining for tj - if anything i&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the opposite, tj is SMITTEN. tj doesn&rsquo;t have to choose between basketball or cyrus, there&rsquo;s no need to choose, because he doesn&rsquo;t value basketball and his reputation over cyrus. they have never had to keep their friendship a secret because of their reputation. i&rsquo;m pretty sure if anyone on the basketball team tried to get tj to stop being friends with cyrus because he&rsquo;s nerdy or embarrassing, tj would go OFF.<br/><br/>overall, this ship is the healthiest, happiest, lgbt ship i&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. wait, no, it&rsquo;s the healthiest and happiest SHIP i&rsquo;ve seen in a long time.<b>\ufeff\u201c</b><br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65R7SctMQy4\">&ndash;Source</a><br/><br/><br/><b>Hey!

He\u2019d stopped for a coffee in the aforementioned caf\u00e9, which he usually timed perfectly, but that day they just happened to be training a new barista, which meant it took nearly twice as long for him to get his coffee.

It wasn\u2019t that Cyrus hated frat boys entirely\u2014they were just people with different interests, after all\u2014but they frequently found ways to annoy him. Or make him late for class. Or both. So, he generally didn\u2019t give them the time of day. </p><p>Cyrus had almost made it through the mine field that was the meadow, when a voice called out from behind him: \u201cLook out!\u201d Cyrus turned, expecting the voice came from yet another frat guy, but instead he came face to face with a confusingly flat projectile, and the next thing he knew he was flat on his back, dew from the grass seeping into his clothes, his forehead throbbing with pain. </p><p>\u201cOh my God, are you okay?\u201d The voice was closer now. \u00a0</p><p>Cyrus groaned, but didn\u2019t move or speak. </p><p>Soon, the stranger to whom the voice belonged was kneeling next to Cyrus, who could only really see his dark blue jeans. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d Cyrus snapped, still not moving. \u201cDo you frat boys ever watch where you throw things?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a fraternity. I play Ultimate Frisbee,\u201d the stranger said, extending a hand. <i>So <b>that</b> was what hit him.

The stranger was stupidly cute, all big, green eyes and dimples and bangs falling in his face. </p><p>\u201cWoah, you okay?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus pulled himself back up. \u201cUh, yeah. But you owe me five bucks for that coffee.\u201d Cyrus gestured to the empty cup next to him in the grass. </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d the boy smirked, \u201cHow about I just buy you another one?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus fought a blush. \u201cI, uh, I\u2019d like that.\u201d There was a long pause, neither one sure what to say, until eventually Cyrus remembered himself.\u00a0\u201cMy name\u2019s Cyrus, by the way.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Cyrus,\u201d the boy\u2019s smirk softened into a genuine smile. \u201cI\u2019m Jonah.\u201d </p>",
