You were also Tony Stark\u2019s little sister, and you knew what a Stark wanted and how a little Stark would act.</p><p>Quickly into staying with Pepper and Morgan, you noticed that Morgan took after Pepper in the attitude department. Morgan was level headed and a bit more mature. She could also shut a conversation down with the most\u00a0\u2018done\u2019 look in the world, and you found it adorable. When Morgan smiled, you remembered everything good about Tony, and how much you missed him. Some days were worse than others. Sometimes, you found it difficult to look at Morgan without tearing up.</p><p>It was in mid-June when the two of you were eating out in Manhattan at Tony\u2019s favorite burger shop, when Morgan spoke up.\u00a0\u201cDad liked cheeseburgers,\u201d she said with a grin and took a bite from her burger.\u00a0</p><p>You smiled, resting you elbow on the table. You rested your chin in the palm of your hand as you gazed at her with your (E/C) eyes.\u00a0\u201cYeah, he sure did. He used to order from here all the time.\u00a0\u2018Specially when he was in the zone making an Iron Man suit.\u201d</p><p>Morgan licked the mustard from her fingers and went to eat her fries. You admired Morgan for being strong, but she was young and she didn\u2019t exactly understand death. Maybe you wished you didn\u2019t understand death. Maybe it would make everything easier, especially when you woke up to see a basic clone of him every morning.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAuntie (Y/N), do you think I could me Iron Girl?\u201d she asked. You paused, your free hand holding a chill drink. The water seeped through the cracks of your fingers. A frown made its way on your face. Did you want Morgan to take that one when she was older.</p><p>You set your drink down, adjusting yourself.\u00a0\u201cI think that is a lot of responsibility for a pretty young girl, Morgan,\u201d you started.\u00a0\u201cI think you could be in the far,<i> far</i> future, but you should find a name for yourself.\u201d You didn\u2019t want Morgan to live in her father\u2019s shadow. If she did become Iron Girl, then she wouldn\u2019t be just Iron Girl, she would be the second Iron Man, and who liked to be second? You surely didn\u2019t.</p><p>Morgan nodded,\u00a0\u201cOkay. Then, I can be a princess?\u201d</p><p>You belted out a laugh. Of course Morgan would ask if she could be a princess.\u00a0\u201cMo, you\u2019re already a princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I really?\u201d Morgan asked, her brown eyes wide with sudden excitement. You loved seeing the innocence in her that resembled Tony\u2019s when it came to technology and science.\u00a0\u201cDo I have a castle?\u201d she asked, her voice becoming a small whisper.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. It\u2019s a big and amazing castle. When you turn sixteen and become a young queen, I shall take you in a chariot to your castle,\u201d you said, voice fond.</p><p>Morgan was nearly jumping out her skin. It was adorable, and her attire didn\u2019t help. She was in a red dress with a golden bow on top. It was like an attempt to be a small Iron Man. Her attitude was just like Tony when something interesting happened.\u00a0</p><p>You could almost feel your tear ducts slowly betraying you.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a long time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery princess must have patience, Mo,\u201d you smiled.</p><p>Morgan pouted, calming down.\u00a0\u201cFine.

Morgan ended up being the brightest light in your world.</p><p>\u201cAre you like Daddy?\u201d Morgan asked, sipping on the chocolate milkshake. </p><p>You shook your head. It was a common question; several people asked you throughout the years. The answer was always the same\u2014 you weren\u2019t anything like your brother. You never wanted the money, and you weren\u2019t as smart as Tony, so even when he did offer you a piece of the company, you turned him down. Being rich was for your past, not now.

I&rsquo;ve seen you do it,&rdquo; Y/N spoke as she stroked little Morgan&rsquo;s hair and looked at Tony with a sad expression. </p><p>He lowered his head as he looked down at the floor and sighed. &ldquo;I just want to leave something behind, something ready, in case something happens to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Y/N with a frown.\u00a0&quot;I refuse to let you come up with the conclusion that you need to leave something recorded in case something happens to you, Tony.\u00a0It&rsquo;s not necessary, because nothing is going to happen to you tomorrow,&ldquo; she said as she raised her voice slightly, causing to the little girl to let go a little whimper. &quot;Sorry, darling,&rdquo; she apologized to the kid.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; whispered Tony as he closed his eyes and enjoyed the gentle breeze caressing his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;\u00a0You must think about her, about both of them, before doing anything. I know that our mission is to bring back all the vanished, but&hellip;\u00a0 Your real responsibility and concern is this!&rdquo; Y/N pointed out as he looked at Morgan, letting Tony understand her message, what she really meant.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, Y/N. But still-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For once, don&rsquo;t be the fucking hero.\u00a0Leave that role to someone else, damn it&hellip;&rdquo; whispered the woman with a frown, as she rocked the girl carefully. &ldquo;For once in your life, I&rsquo;m begging you, don&rsquo;t be the one who has to do everything!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say all this just because you&rsquo;ve seen me make the video before, do you?&rdquo; asked the genius Stark as he pulled away the hair that fell on his daughter&rsquo;s face and put it behind her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;No. You see, I&rsquo;ve had these strange dreams again&hellip;\u00a0Like the ones I told you about before the Sokovia agreements and the&hellip;\u00a0You know, before everything that happened five years ago,&rdquo; said the woman with E/C eyes, as she bit her lip, trying to hold back the urge to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;You have premonitory dreams again,&rdquo; said the brunette man looking at his friend with concern.\u00a0 He placed one of his hands on Y/N&rsquo;s shoulder to try to comfort her, but it was in vain as she began to cry in silence.</p><p>The youngest Stark seemed to notice how the woman holding her in a hug must have been feeling, so she unconsciously grabbed her with more strength, still asleep, as if she was trying to calm her, to comfort her, and make her understand that everything was fine.\u00a0That she was there, and that everything would be fine.</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, Morgan,&rdquo; whispered the c/h haired woman in tears, noticing how the little one was trying to comfort her.\u00a0&quot;Thank you, little miss Stark&hellip;&ldquo; she said before posing a kiss on the crown of the toddler, so that she could rest her chin on the little head.</p><p>&quot;Hey, guys,&rdquo; Pepper whispered as she approached the couple of friends who shared an intimate moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for Morgan, it&rsquo;s time to put her to bed.\u00a0It&rsquo;s a bit too late,&rdquo; said Tony&rsquo;s wife, as she crouched next to Y/N and held her daughter in her arms.\u00a0&quot;Thank you for being with her today.\u00a0 We missed you so much,&ldquo; the redhead said with a small smile.</p><p>&quot;It&rsquo;s the least I can do for my goddaughter.\u00a0After all, I missed her too. All of you.&rdquo; said the young avenger before caressing the girl&rsquo;s cheek as a sign of farewell good night.</p><p>Tony got up from the stairs on the porch so that he could give his daughter a proper kiss and send her off to bed. &ldquo;Night night, Maguna. I love you tons, baby girl.&rdquo; he whispered softly in the girl&rsquo;s ear, before posing a long kiss on her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;I do it 3000, papa,&rdquo; said groggy the little one, as she rested her head on her mother&rsquo;s shoulder, looking for comfort and warmth in her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep now, too,&rdquo; Pepper said, trying to disguise his desire to yawn.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.\u00a0Good night, Peps.&rdquo; said goodbye Tony before giving his tired wife a short kiss on the lips. &ldquo;Sleep well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good night, Pepper&rdquo; Y/N said goodbye to her friend with a small smile and a small hug, after getting up from where she had been sitting. </p><p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow,&rdquo; the woman said goodbye before getting inside the house, this time with her daughter in her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; exclaimed the Stark before he lost sight of the lady of the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; Y/L/N called his friend, thus gaining his attention. &ldquo;This is something you can&rsquo;t miss for anything in the world.\u00a0I wouldn&rsquo;t forgive you,&rdquo; she earnestly pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been dreaming of my death?&rdquo; asked the man as he folded his arms and watched his friend, while waiting for a sincere answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Since we started looking for a solution to this fucking disaster.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; plenty of time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you to play your part in the background tomorrow.\u00a0I can&rsquo;t afford to lose anyone else, you know? I can&rsquo;t afford to let anyone else die.

Any scenario could develop, and that terrified him in an unimaginable way.&nbsp;Losing his family and friends was a blow that he would never know how to fit in, and so he preferred not to even think about it.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time for me to go home.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s late and I had promised Nat that we would-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo; said Tony as he held his friend&rsquo;s face between his hands and made her look into his eyes. &ldquo;You know perfectly well that I love you very much, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p><p>She nodded and smiled warmly.&nbsp;\"I know perfectly well, Tony,&ldquo; she replied, causing Tony to pose a kiss on her forehead, then hug her again. \"I love you too, Stark.&rdquo; whispered Y/N to him before she broke the hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye, kiddo,&rdquo; said Tony goodbye as his friend headed to her car.</p><p>Y/N raised her hand as a bye sign and smiled at him broadly, with a little laugh.&nbsp;\"See you, my dude.&ldquo;&nbsp;She wavered at him as she got into her car.</p><p>\"Hey, Y/L/N!&rdquo; Stark exclaimed as he watched the woman start the vehicle. &ldquo;No surprises tomorrow!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Take your own advice, you old wreck.&nbsp;And remember you made me a promise!&rdquo; </p><p><b>***</b></p><p>&ldquo;I am&hellip;&nbsp;Inevitable.&rdquo; Thanos said arrogantly, before snapping his fingers, which didn&rsquo;t work, because the gauntlet didn&rsquo;t have a any of the infinity stones. </p><p>The mad titan looked with an open mouth and incredulous look at the gauntlet and then at the young woman in front of him.&nbsp;He saw how the power of the stones invaded the body of the female human and how her body react at such magnitude of power. Y/N was in pain.&nbsp;And because of that, she shouted and complained, until her body ended up adapting to all the stones. </p><p>But it wouldn&rsquo;t last long. </p><p><i>Oopsie</i></p><p>Y/N looked defiantly at Thanos, who had remained static looking at her, knowing what was coming next for him and that it was inevitable.&nbsp;\"Yeah, well, and&hellip; we are&hellip; the Avengers!&ldquo; snapped the young woman without hesitation. </p><p>A white flash flooded the place for a few moments, followed by it, all the allies of Thanos and himself, began to turn to dust in the battlefield, as 5 years ago millions of beings from all over the universe had done it before. </p><p><i>Karma is a bitch, huh?</i></p><p>\"I just fried myself, well done Y/L/N&hellip;&rdquo; commented Y/N to herself, trying to make her situation less serious, as the right half of her own body was totally burned and a huge wound in the area of her femoral artery from where emanated lots of blood. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N/N&hellip;&rdquo; called a soft voice, which addressed to her.&nbsp;\"What ha-&hellip; What have you done?&ldquo; </p><p>Y/N finished sitting and leaning on a pile of rubble, looked up and saw Tony, Rhodey, Peter, Pepper, Steve and Thor approaching her.&nbsp;Some of them ducked on to stay at her height and others stood watching everything. </p><p>She smiled weakly and looked at his dearest friend.&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;ve made them to bite the&hellip;&nbsp;dust, you get it?&rdquo; the woman laughed briefly, before grabbing her side because the pain she felt. &ldquo;Goddammit&hellip;&rdquo; she complained. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll still take you to a place where you can be cured and-&rdquo; Captain America tried to talk, as he approached his friend and tried to hold her in his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;No, no&hellip;&nbsp;Steve, no. It&rsquo;s okay, there&rsquo;s nothing that can be done for me.&rdquo; she whispered as she took the captain&rsquo;s hand and stroked it.&nbsp;\"Let it be, please&hellip;&ldquo; she whispered and then gave Tony a warm look. \"This is how it had to happen, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Y/N, please&hellip;\"&nbsp;begged Stark as he stroked her good friend&rsquo;s cheek, who was beginning to have trouble breathing. \"Friday, tell me her situation.\"&nbsp;he asked to the A.I.</p><p>\"Her vital signs are compromised, sir.&rdquo; answered Friday. </p><p>Everyone began to cry in silence. Tony sobbed a little before leaning his head against Y/N&rsquo;s head as he stroked her cheek.&nbsp;She smiled weakly and gently wiped away his tears. </p><p>&ldquo;Your girls need you, Tony.&nbsp;Morgan has both parents.&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t ask for anything better&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered as she looked at Pepper, who was crying in Rhodey&rsquo;s arms and dedicated one of her last smiles to them. </p><p>&ldquo;But, I-I&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered between loud sobs as big tears were falling down his cheeks.&nbsp;\"Y/N&hellip;&ldquo; </p><p>Y/N placed her hand on her friend&rsquo;s chest, over the light of his Ractor Arc, and then gave him one last, small but warm smile.&nbsp;Tony held Y/N&rsquo;s hand on his chest and watched her life flee by moments. </p><p>Indeed, nothing could be done for her, it was late.</p><p>\"N-No, Y/N&rdquo; Peter begged as he got on his knees and embraced the corpse of his friend. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, stay. Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. Stay with us.  Don&rsquo;t die. Stay&hellip; with us.&rdquo; he sobbed so hard, that Thor started to cry even harder. </p><p>&ldquo;You were&hellip; No, you are also my girl. I need you in my life.&rdquo; whispered Tony in his dearest friend&rsquo;s ear, even when he knew that she couldn&rsquo;t hear him. &ldquo;God, I need my girl.&rdquo; pronounced before closing Y/N&rsquo;s eyes for ever.</p><p>Silence and sobs ruled the place once again.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s how it all ended.</p>",

A moonbeam gently filtered in through the almost closed blinds, and there was white noise coming softly from a machine in the corner. The scent of bergamot floated from an essential oil diffuser on a small table. In short, the calm, dreamy setup was perfect for a couple who just needed some rest. One man would argue that his partner needed to be getting MORE rest, but that was neither here nor there. Stephen, the taller of the two, held a half asleep Tony in his arms, softly tracing stars onto his back. Tony, content in his lover\u2019s embrace, smirked.

Tony didn\u2019t know. He could hardly keep up with his son) and it had a question that he desperately wanted to ask Stephen. Tony yawned and snuggled further into Stephen\u2019s chest, smiling as Stephen hugged him tighter and dropped a kiss on his head. Now was as good as any time to ask a weird ass question. Tony yawned again and reached up to ruffle Stephen\u2019s hair. What could he say, the sorcerer supreme liked to cuddle. Tony often thought he should be called the snuggler supreme, and if that was his contact name for Stephen in his phone, nobody had to know. \u201cSteph?\u201d Tony asked, softly rubbing Stephen\u2019s cheek. \u201cHm?\u201d Stephen replied, tiredness present in his voice. \u201cNot to get political or anything, but what the fuck is oatmeal?\u201d Tony asked, barely able to contain his laughter. Stephen, despite himself, laughed. \u201cTony,\u201d he said, \u201cPeter showed me that meme earlier today.

Stephen, despite himself, laughed. \u201cTony,\u201d he said, \u201cPeter showed me that meme earlier today.
