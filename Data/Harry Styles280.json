I liked the idea of being able to lie down on the couch or soaking in the tub with him without having to say a word. Being in this new situation, however, I think I might be comprehending what he meant.\u00a0</p><p>The last traffic light before reaching home was taking much longer than I remembered. Before tonight I was always relieved to see it, but right now the last thing I wanted was to be in the house with him. The entire car ride was enveloped with silence, the air in our home would be just as stale. At least in the car, he didn\u2019t get a say in our proximity, but once we walked through the door, there would be too much space for my comfortability. Tonight was supposed to be fun and memorable and romantic, but I had to ruin it.\u00a0</p><p>The radio was on the lowest volume, but I wasn\u2019t focused on figuring out what song was playing. I peered out my window and allowed the inaudible tears to flow from my cheeks down my neck, lightly dampening the collar\u00a0of my dress. One of my hands grazed the moistened fabric while my other hand clutched onto my elbow. Harry had one hand gripping the steering wheel and the opposite pinching his lower lip between his index and thumb. Every time his tears began to dry they started again, running down his face almost as quickly as the thoughts in his head.</p><p>After an eternity, the light turned green. The car rolled forward towards our street. We pulled into the garage, and Harry put the car in park before turning it off. Harry leaves the vehicle first and walks into the house. I watch the door close before I take a deep breath and grab my overpriced, painful heels and follow him inside.\u00a0</p><p>If I thought tonight couldn\u2019t get any worse, I was sadly mistaken. The heavenly mood staged by candlelights on every counter, shelf, stair step, table, and trim gave the entire home a straight out of a dream look. There had to be hundreds. As I walked through the first floor, I noticed my favorite flowers strategically set up in a way that looked slightly carelessly thrown, but somehow still uniformed. The backs of my hands were covered in black mascara, and I could feel my breathing on the verge of becoming hiccupped\u00a0gasping. My sweaty palms grasped at my chest as if it would help me hold onto some oxygen.\u00a0</p><p>All of my senses\u00a0were delayed\u00a0since the moments before leaving the restaurant. My\u00a0ears recognize the music coming through the speakers.\u00a0\u201cAfter All\u201d by Josh Cash is faint, but it\u2019s there.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYou taught me how to sing, And bring you love.\u201d</i></p><p>How pathetic and selfish could I be? I put myself here. I said no, I rejected him, yet I still had the nerve to be heartbroken.\u00a0</p><p>When did he even have time to do this? We were home earlier, and he was at dinner with us the whole night. There was no way he did it. I feel his presence enter into the kitchen. I slowly turn to look at him. We are standing on two ends of the room, but it feels more like two ends of the Earth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did you do all this?\u201d I whisper so softly I\u2019m not sure he even heard me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJeff, Glenne, Lou, Cameron, and Alice.\u201d He answers, keeping his arms crossed and his gaze down.</p><p>I nod even though I know he\u2019s not looking at me. I turn my attention towards the island. There are two bottles of champagne in a bucket of ice and box from my favorite bakery.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you.\u201d His eyes have turned up to the island, and from the glow of the candles, I can see the tears begging to spill over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that hungry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>The comfortable silence that he hates steps into the room with us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a shower.\u201d I sniffle and start trudging out the other entrance. I walk up the stairs slowly, making sure not to knock over any candles or to step on any flowers, but also to appreciate the hard work so it did not go entirely to waste. I open the door to our bedroom, and for the thousandth time tonight, my heart selfishly breaks. I try to muffle the cry that escapes my throat. There are strings of lights hung from the ceiling and photos from the last 5 and half years of Harry and me. I don\u2019t look at too many because I know it will only upset me more. I step into the bathroom to see two flukes set next to tub filled with rose petals. I strip down and turn on the shower, trying to ignore the space that was meant to be shared with the love of my life and filled with lots of kisses and excitement about a wedding.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother turning on any lights and allow the candles to continue to do their job.\u00a0</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t I say yes? I know I want to spend the rest of my life with Harry, and that entails marriage, but not yet. Not when his career is just taking off. I know we need to talk about it, but I\u2019m not even sure what could be going through his head. If I\u2019m not ready now, does that mean he won\u2019t want to wait around for me to be? The water is no longer warm and brings me out of my flooded thoughts. I turn off the water and slip into sweatpants and a sweatshirt. He will be aware of my discomfort when he notices I\u2019m not wearing at least one piece of his clothing. I open the door back to the bedroom and see Harry sitting on my side of the bed. The lights and pictures were lying on the table near the balcony door. He twists the ring in his fingers. The ring that was supposed to be on my hand right now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just need to change my clothes and then I can clean up downstairs. You can sleep in here, I\u2019ll take the guest room.\u201d</p><p>My stomach drops as he finishes his sentence. He doesn\u2019t even want to. sleep in the same bed. I knew this would be worse than the car ride.</p><p>\u201cI can start cle-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He cuts me off.</p><p>I blink back the burning in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in here, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything back. He pushes the ring into his pocket and rubs his index across his nose once. And for the first time since we left the parking lot, he looks at me. He swallows hard before he steps into the bathroom to reach his closet. I pull at my sleeves as the anxiety in my stomach moves through my chest, and my heart begins to race. I speed walk downstairs and run into his studio and close the door behind me. This has been the only room in the house I\u2019ve seen without candles. Luckily, Harry has soft blue LED lights that guide me through the room. I step into the sound booth and finally let myself cry. I curl up into the corner and gasp for air that doesn\u2019t sting with every breath.\u00a0</p><p>For someone who hates comfortable silence, he has given her an invitation into our home tonight. My head rests in my hands and I\u00a0hopelessly continue to suck in useless breaths. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been in here.\u00a0</p><p>The clock on the wall reads 2:38. He has to be close to finishing by now. I don\u2019t move from my spot, but I wonder what he could be doing.\u00a0</p><p>3:06.</p><p>I finally get the courage to leave the room. The candles on the stairs and in the living room are all out, but I can still see a glow from the kitchen. I hear quick and heavy breathing. I quietly step to the door and slowly turn my eyes to the boy with his head in his hands, and barely able to stand on his own. The velvet box he once held with so much pride sat in front of him, complemented by an open bottle of champagne. Of everything that had taken place tonight, this one had to be the worst. He was heartbroken and distraught because of me. I did this to him and all I can do is stand here and watch him suffer.\u00a0</p><p>I step into his space, but he isn\u2019t aware of me. I gently bring a hand to his back and the other to his bicep. He jumps slightly and cries harder. I rest my head on his shoulder blade and in an effort to calm him down, I run my hand up and down his spine. It is no help.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I try to soothe him.</p><p>His legs can no longer carry his heavy heart, slowly we make our way down to the floor. We hold onto each other like the other might float off into space if one of us were to let go. We cry together for a short while before eventually matching each other\u2019s exhausted breathing. His head rested on my chest supported by my hand on his cheek, and his arms tangled around my torso. My other hand still ran across his back.\u00a0</p><p>Just before I believe he might have fallen asleep I hear him speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not being enough of what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019ve always been more than enough.\u201d</p><p>He slowly sits up and leans his back against the cabinet. He looks me in the eyes and stays quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to marry me?\u201d he presses.</p><p>I\u2019m the one to break the eye contact. My new focal point is my lap. I rub my palms and fingertips together.</p><p>\u201cI do want to marry you. I\u2019ve wanted to marry you since I met you,\u201d I smile to myself remembering the day we met.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut getting married affects more people than just the two of us.\u201d I turn my head back to him. His eyes look like they are made of glass, but I know he won\u2019t cry anymore tonight.</p><p>\u201cOf all people, why do you care what anyone else thinks of us?\u201d he returns.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I almost feel like he\u2019s accusing me of something.</p><p>He looks at me with his eyebrows pushing closer together, as if they\u2019re asking me to explain.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEverything is taking off for you. You\u2019ve released an album, starred in a movie, finished a world tour, and now the show. You\u2019re constantly working on your upcoming projects, I just don\u2019t see how a wedding fits into all of it. And I don\u2019t want to have the responsibility to have to remind you to come home.\u201d My voice shakes, but I open my heart to him so he can try to understand where I\u2019m coming from.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to make me choose,\u201d He thinks out loud now.</p><p>\u201cbut you do know I\u2019d pick you over it all in half a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just scared.\u201d I choke out.</p><p>He leans forward and grabs my\u00a0shaking hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have to be scared alone now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His thumbs rub over the backs of my hands that\u00a0are half the size of his.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m scared too, love.\u201d One of his hands reaches up to caress my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I break again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to be sorry for. We\u2019re going to be okay, you hear me?\u201d He searches for any remaining hope in my eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not breaking up right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He kisses my forehead.</p><p>\u201cCan we go to bed now? Together?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>OKAY this is my first attempt I hope it\u2019s not too ugly. I\u2019m open to loads of feedback! dont forget to send in request and i have prompt post on my page if yall need some ideas. HOPE YALL LIKE IT!!!!!!!!</p>",

I liked the idea of being able to lie down on the couch or soaking in the tub with him without having to say a word. Being in this new situation, however, I think I might be comprehending what he meant.\u00a0</p><p>The last traffic light before reaching home was taking much longer than I remembered. Before tonight I was always relieved to see it, but right now the last thing I wanted was to be in the house with him. The entire car ride was enveloped with silence, the air in our home would be just as stale. At least in the car, he didn\u2019t get a say in our proximity, but once we walked through the door, there would be too much space for my comfortability. Tonight was supposed to be fun and memorable and romantic, but I had to ruin it.\u00a0</p><p>The radio was on the lowest volume, but I wasn\u2019t focused on figuring out what song was playing. I peered out my window and allowed the inaudible tears to flow from my cheeks down my neck, lightly dampening the collar\u00a0of my dress. One of my hands grazed the moistened fabric while my other hand clutched onto my elbow. Harry had one hand gripping the steering wheel and the opposite pinching his lower lip between his index and thumb. Every time his tears began to dry they started again, running down his face almost as quickly as the thoughts in his head.</p><p>After an eternity, the light turned green. The car rolled forward towards our street. We pulled into the garage, and Harry put the car in park before turning it off. Harry leaves the vehicle first and walks into the house. I watch the door close before I take a deep breath and grab my overpriced, painful heels and follow him inside.\u00a0</p><p>If I thought tonight couldn\u2019t get any worse, I was sadly mistaken. The heavenly mood staged by candlelights on every counter, shelf, stair step, table, and trim gave the entire home a straight out of a dream look. There had to be hundreds. As I walked through the first floor, I noticed my favorite flowers strategically set up in a way that looked slightly carelessly thrown, but somehow still uniformed. The backs of my hands were covered in black mascara, and I could feel my breathing on the verge of becoming hiccupped\u00a0gasping. My sweaty palms grasped at my chest as if it would help me hold onto some oxygen.\u00a0</p><p>All of my senses\u00a0were delayed\u00a0since the moments before leaving the restaurant. My\u00a0ears recognize the music coming through the speakers.\u00a0\u201cAfter All\u201d by Josh Cash is faint, but it\u2019s there.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYou taught me how to sing, And bring you love.\u201d</i></p><p>How pathetic and selfish could I be? I put myself here. I said no, I rejected him, yet I still had the nerve to be heartbroken.\u00a0</p><p>When did he even have time to do this? We were home earlier, and he was at dinner with us the whole night. There was no way he did it. I feel his presence enter into the kitchen. I slowly turn to look at him. We are standing on two ends of the room, but it feels more like two ends of the Earth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did you do all this?\u201d I whisper so softly I\u2019m not sure he even heard me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJeff, Glenne, Lou, Cameron, and Alice.\u201d He answers, keeping his arms crossed and his gaze down.</p><p>I nod even though I know he\u2019s not looking at me. I turn my attention towards the island. There are two bottles of champagne in a bucket of ice and box from my favorite bakery.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you.\u201d His eyes have turned up to the island, and from the glow of the candles, I can see the tears begging to spill over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that hungry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>The comfortable silence that he hates steps into the room with us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a shower.\u201d I sniffle and start trudging out the other entrance. I walk up the stairs slowly, making sure not to knock over any candles or to step on any flowers, but also to appreciate the hard work so it did not go entirely to waste. I open the door to our bedroom, and for the thousandth time tonight, my heart selfishly breaks. I try to muffle the cry that escapes my throat. There are strings of lights hung from the ceiling and photos from the last 5 and half years of Harry and me. I don\u2019t look at too many because I know it will only upset me more. I step into the bathroom to see two flukes set next to tub filled with rose petals. I strip down and turn on the shower, trying to ignore the space that was meant to be shared with the love of my life and filled with lots of kisses and excitement about a wedding.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother turning on any lights and allow the candles to continue to do their job.\u00a0</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t I say yes? I know I want to spend the rest of my life with Harry, and that entails marriage, but not yet. Not when his career is just taking off. I know we need to talk about it, but I\u2019m not even sure what could be going through his head. If I\u2019m not ready now, does that mean he won\u2019t want to wait around for me to be? The water is no longer warm and brings me out of my flooded thoughts. I turn off the water and slip into sweatpants and a sweatshirt. He will be aware of my discomfort when he notices I\u2019m not wearing at least one piece of his clothing. I open the door back to the bedroom and see Harry sitting on my side of the bed. The lights and pictures were lying on the table near the balcony door. He twists the ring in his fingers. The ring that was supposed to be on my hand right now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just need to change my clothes and then I can clean up downstairs. You can sleep in here, I\u2019ll take the guest room.\u201d</p><p>My stomach drops as he finishes his sentence. He doesn\u2019t even want to. sleep in the same bed. I knew this would be worse than the car ride.</p><p>\u201cI can start cle-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He cuts me off.</p><p>I blink back the burning in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in here, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything back. He pushes the ring into his pocket and rubs his index across his nose once. And for the first time since we left the parking lot, he looks at me. He swallows hard before he steps into the bathroom to reach his closet. I pull at my sleeves as the anxiety in my stomach moves through my chest, and my heart begins to race. I speed walk downstairs and run into his studio and close the door behind me. This has been the only room in the house I\u2019ve seen without candles. Luckily, Harry has soft blue LED lights that guide me through the room. I step into the sound booth and finally let myself cry. I curl up into the corner and gasp for air that doesn\u2019t sting with every breath.\u00a0</p><p>For someone who hates comfortable silence, he has given her an invitation into our home tonight. My head rests in my hands and I\u00a0hopelessly continue to suck in useless breaths. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been in here.\u00a0</p><p>The clock on the wall reads 2:38. He has to be close to finishing by now. I don\u2019t move from my spot, but I wonder what he could be doing.\u00a0</p><p>3:06.</p><p>I finally get the courage to leave the room. The candles on the stairs and in the living room are all out, but I can still see a glow from the kitchen. I hear quick and heavy breathing. I quietly step to the door and slowly turn my eyes to the boy with his head in his hands, and barely able to stand on his own. The velvet box he once held with so much pride sat in front of him, complemented by an open bottle of champagne. Of everything that had taken place tonight, this one had to be the worst. He was heartbroken and distraught because of me. I did this to him and all I can do is stand here and watch him suffer.\u00a0</p><p>I step into his space, but he isn\u2019t aware of me. I gently bring a hand to his back and the other to his bicep. He jumps slightly and cries harder. I rest my head on his shoulder blade and in an effort to calm him down, I run my hand up and down his spine. It is no help.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I try to soothe him.</p><p>His legs can no longer carry his heavy heart, slowly we make our way down to the floor. We hold onto each other like the other might float off into space if one of us were to let go. We cry together for a short while before eventually matching each other\u2019s exhausted breathing. His head rested on my chest supported by my hand on his cheek, and his arms tangled around my torso. My other hand still ran across his back.\u00a0</p><p>Just before I believe he might have fallen asleep I hear him speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not being enough of what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019ve always been more than enough.\u201d</p><p>He slowly sits up and leans his back against the cabinet. He looks me in the eyes and stays quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to marry me?\u201d he presses.</p><p>I\u2019m the one to break the eye contact. My new focal point is my lap. I rub my palms and fingertips together.</p><p>\u201cI do want to marry you. I\u2019ve wanted to marry you since I met you,\u201d I smile to myself remembering the day we met.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut getting married affects more people than just the two of us.\u201d I turn my head back to him. His eyes look like they are made of glass, but I know he won\u2019t cry anymore tonight.</p><p>\u201cOf all people, why do you care what anyone else thinks of us?\u201d he returns.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I almost feel like he\u2019s accusing me of something.</p><p>He looks at me with his eyebrows pushing closer together, as if they\u2019re asking me to explain.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEverything is taking off for you. You\u2019ve released an album, starred in a movie, finished a world tour, and now the show. You\u2019re constantly working on your upcoming projects, I just don\u2019t see how a wedding fits into all of it.

We hold onto each other like the other might float off into space if one of us were to let go. We cry together for a short while before eventually matching each other&rsquo;s exhausted breathing. His head rested on my chest supported by my hand on his cheek, and his arms tangled around my torso. My other hand still ran across his back.&nbsp;</p><p>Just before I believe he might have fallen asleep I hear him speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you sorry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For not being enough of what you need.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you&rsquo;ve always been more than enough.&rdquo;</p><p>He slowly sits up and leans his back against the cabinet. He looks me in the eyes and stays quiet for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you want to marry me?&rdquo; he presses.</p><p>I&rsquo;m the one to break the eye contact. My new focal point is my lap. I rub my palms and fingertips together.</p><p>&ldquo;I do want to marry you. I&rsquo;ve wanted to marry you since I met you,&rdquo; I smile to myself remembering the day we met.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But getting married affects more people than just the two of us.&rdquo; I turn my head back to him. His eyes look like they are made of glass, but I know he won&rsquo;t cry anymore tonight.</p><p>&ldquo;Of all people, why do you care what anyone else thinks of us?&rdquo; he returns.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I almost feel like he&rsquo;s accusing me of something.</p><p>He looks at me with his eyebrows pushing closer together, as if they&rsquo;re asking me to explain.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is taking off for you. You&rsquo;ve released an album, starred in a movie, finished a world tour, and now the show. You&rsquo;re constantly working on your upcoming projects, I just don&rsquo;t see how a wedding fits into all of it. And I don&rsquo;t want to have the responsibility to have to remind you to come home.&rdquo; My voice shakes, but I open my heart to him so he can try to understand where I&rsquo;m coming from.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to make me choose,&rdquo; He thinks out loud now.</p><p>&ldquo;but you do know I&rsquo;d pick you over it all in half a heartbeat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just scared.&rdquo; I choke out.</p><p>He leans forward and grabs my&nbsp;shaking hands.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good thing you don&rsquo;t have to be scared alone now, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; His thumbs rub over the backs of my hands that&nbsp;are half the size of his.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared too, love.&rdquo; One of his hands reaches up to caress my face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; I break again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have anything to be sorry for. We&rsquo;re going to be okay, you hear me?&rdquo; He searches for any remaining hope in my eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not breaking up right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; He kisses my forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we go to bed now? Together?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>OKAY this is my first attempt I hope it&rsquo;s not too ugly. I&rsquo;m open to loads of feedback! dont forget to send in request and i have prompt post on my page if yall need some ideas. HOPE YALL LIKE IT!!!!!!!!</p></p>",
