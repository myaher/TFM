Sansa's getting so much hate for that scene and I'm not sure why they added it in the first place, what are we getting from this conversation?But the entire crypts scenes were a mess imo",

Someone even mocked her for being raped and the wording of his mockery is so disgusting, I swear I&rsquo;m not making this up. Like, this makes me wonder what does the writer want for her? Nothing is being perceived well about her<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>first, thank you so much for wanting my opinion on this! :)</p><p>I think the final three episodes might not top episode 3 in spectacle department but I think the final 3 episodes will have more compelling drama than the first 3 combined. Things are about to get really messy and it\u2019s gonna happen fast. i\u2019m really excited about it.\u00a0</p><p>As far as Sansa\u2019s words to Tyrion. I think that there are two parts to her behavior. I think a part of her wanted to connect with the only person she had any sort of decent history with at that moment. she was terrified and without her family. She clearly wanted to be out there with her people and at her sister\u2019s side but she knew it wasn\u2019t safe so she was stuck in the dark with a bunch of people she\u2019s not that close to with the fear that she could die at any minute of the WWs breech the entry to the crypts. Tyrion was the only person down there she had any real connection to so it was natural for her to want to connect with him. Despite their marriage being arranged and what his family did to her family Sansa see\u2019s Tyrion as someone who was decent to her at a time when no one else was. I know book Tyrion was different but in show canon from Sansa\u2019s POV Tyrion never tried to force himself on her, he tried to comfort her when her family was murdered, and he tried to protect her from joffrey as best as he could so I think she will always have a certain fondness from him for the simple fact that he was decent at a time when she was starved of common decency from everyone else. I think sharing that moment with Tyrion helped Sansa feel less alone down there and was a good distraction.\u00a0</p><p>I also think that Sansa has recognized that Tyrion as a clear soft spot for her. He sought her out soon after he got to Winterfell. He looks at her with a certain mix of longing and admiration. He keeps mentioning how they were married and alluding to wishing they still were. So I think that even though the first part of her communication with him was about making a genuine connection with someone familiar in a terrifying situation, the second part of her conversation to him was about her planting seeds for the future if there is one. Sansa knows that Tyrion and Dany\u2019s relationship is hot and cold and Tyrion is insecure about his position with her. She also knows that Dany has doubts about him despite her recent outward show of confidence in him. I think she also knows exactly what is driving Tyrion and she\u2019s already mentioned that men do stupid things for\u00a0\u201clove\u201d. Tyrion\u2019s rocky relationship with the woman that Sansa clearly opposes and his clear soft spot for her means that Sansa is a clear avenue to manipulate a valuable player of the game for her own cause. I don\u2019t for a second think she would ever give Tyrion a chance but she wanted a light moment with him and she wanted Tyrion to think that he has a chance if he shifts his loyalties to her later down the line. Getting Dany\u2019s had to betray her and join her cause , as well as securing the loyalty of one of the better thinkers in the realm would be HUGE in Sansa\u2019s quest to get the north from under Dany and Sansa knows this so she\u2019s slowly setting that play in motion and honestly I think that it just might work because Tyrion won\u2019t be forgetting what they shared in those crypts on the brink of death anytime soon. Sansa knows that she can\u2019t beat dany on manpower alone, Dany has 2 dragons, if she\u2019s gonna dethrone her she\u2019s gonna have to be smart, meticulous, and subtle in her approach and this is more of her doing that.\u00a0</p><p>as far as the idea that Sansa needs redemption goes, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s from someone who never liked Sansa to begin with. In order for someone to need redemption they have to commit egregious sins, and contrary to what the fanboys and Dany ass kickers think being born a traditionally feminine woman in a male dominated world is not a sin that requires redemption. The writers have slowly made Sansa one of the major players in the game and have slowly built up her leadership and loyalty from the people around her while showing the exact opposite of her rivals. They have also showed more than once that Sansa is usually always right. She was right about Jon\u2019s trip to Dragonstone, she was right about Ramsey in the BOTB, she was right about Cersei, she was right about Jon letting the Karstarks and the Umbers off easy only showed other houses that they can also be disloyal and escape punishment which is why Lord Glover abandoned Jon and the war AGAIN. She also predicted exactly how the northern lords would react to Jon\u2019s extended absence. Certain people choose to ignore this because they refuse to acknowledge that Sansa is a real threat to their favorite even tho it\u2019s been established over and over at this point. Sansa is Dany\u2019s rival right now even thought Dany only sees her as a minor nuisance on her quest to the bigger problem in Cersei but I suspect she will learn soon enough that she should have paid more attention to the threat Sansa posed to her because Sansa will snatch everything she holds dear right from under her without every having to lift a finger or swords.\u00a0</p><p>Basically the writer\u2019s plan for Sansa is LEADERSHIP. She\u2019s clearly being positioned as a contender for a crown and as a rival for Dany. At this point the only question left is which crown that is, the northern crown or the crown of the 7 kindgoms. The sansa haters know this and that\u2019s why they made, it\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t picking up on it, they are, they just refuse to acknowledge it and think that nitpicking her every move and bringing up old stuff will someone make that reality go away.\u00a0</p>",

She clearly wanted to be out there with her people and at her sister\u2019s side but she knew it wasn\u2019t safe so she was stuck in the dark with a bunch of people she\u2019s not that close to with the fear that she could die at any minute of the WWs breech the entry to the crypts. Tyrion was the only person down there she had any real connection to so it was natural for her to want to connect with him. Despite their marriage being arranged and what his family did to her family Sansa see\u2019s Tyrion as someone who was decent to her at a time when no one else was. I know book Tyrion was different but in show canon from Sansa\u2019s POV Tyrion never tried to force himself on her, he tried to comfort her when her family was murdered, and he tried to protect her from joffrey as best as he could so I think she will always have a certain fondness from him for the simple fact that he was decent at a time when she was starved of common decency from everyone else. I think sharing that moment with Tyrion helped Sansa feel less alone down there and was a good distraction.\u00a0</p><p>I also think that Sansa has recognized that Tyrion as a clear soft spot for her. He sought her out soon after he got to Winterfell. He looks at her with a certain mix of longing and admiration. He keeps mentioning how they were married and alluding to wishing they still were. So I think that even though the first part of her communication with him was about making a genuine connection with someone familiar in a terrifying situation, the second part of her conversation to him was about her planting seeds for the future if there is one. Sansa knows that Tyrion and Dany\u2019s relationship is hot and cold and Tyrion is insecure about his position with her. She also knows that Dany has doubts about him despite her recent outward show of confidence in him. I think she also knows exactly what is driving Tyrion and she\u2019s already mentioned that men do stupid things for\u00a0\u201clove\u201d. Tyrion\u2019s rocky relationship with the woman that Sansa clearly opposes and his clear soft spot for her means that Sansa is a clear avenue to manipulate a valuable player of the game for her own cause. I don\u2019t for a second think she would ever give Tyrion a chance but she wanted a light moment with him and she wanted Tyrion to think that he has a chance if he shifts his loyalties to her later down the line. Getting Dany\u2019s had to betray her and join her cause , as well as securing the loyalty of one of the better thinkers in the realm would be HUGE in Sansa\u2019s quest to get the north from under Dany and Sansa knows this so she\u2019s slowly setting that play in motion and honestly I think that it just might work because Tyrion won\u2019t be forgetting what they shared in those crypts on the brink of death anytime soon. Sansa knows that she can\u2019t beat dany on manpower alone, Dany has 2 dragons, if she\u2019s gonna dethrone her she\u2019s gonna have to be smart, meticulous, and subtle in her approach and this is more of her doing that.\u00a0</p><p>as far as the idea that Sansa needs redemption goes, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s from someone who never liked Sansa to begin with. In order for someone to need redemption they have to commit egregious sins, and contrary to what the fanboys and Dany ass kickers think being born a traditionally feminine woman in a male dominated world is not a sin that requires redemption. The writers have slowly made Sansa one of the major players in the game and have slowly built up her leadership and loyalty from the people around her while showing the exact opposite of her rivals. They have also showed more than once that Sansa is usually always right. She was right about Jon\u2019s trip to Dragonstone, she was right about Ramsey in the BOTB, she was right about Cersei, she was right about Jon letting the Karstarks and the Umbers off easy only showed other houses that they can also be disloyal and escape punishment which is why Lord Glover abandoned Jon and the war AGAIN. She also predicted exactly how the northern lords would react to Jon\u2019s extended absence. Certain people choose to ignore this because they refuse to acknowledge that Sansa is a real threat to their favorite even tho it\u2019s been established over and over at this point. Sansa is Dany\u2019s rival right now even thought Dany only sees her as a minor nuisance on her quest to the bigger problem in Cersei but I suspect she will learn soon enough that she should have paid more attention to the threat Sansa posed to her because Sansa will snatch everything she holds dear right from under her without every having to lift a finger or swords.\u00a0</p><p>Basically the writer\u2019s plan for Sansa is LEADERSHIP. She\u2019s clearly being positioned as a contender for a crown and as a rival for Dany. At this point the only question left is which crown that is, the northern crown or the crown of the 7 kindgoms. The sansa haters know this and that\u2019s why they made, it\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t picking up on it, they are, they just refuse to acknowledge it and think that nitpicking her every move and bringing up old stuff will someone make that reality go away.\u00a0</p>",

Nothing is being perceived well about her<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>first, thank you so much for wanting my opinion on this! :)</p><p>I think the final three episodes might not top episode 3 in spectacle department but I think the final 3 episodes will have more compelling drama than the first 3 combined.
