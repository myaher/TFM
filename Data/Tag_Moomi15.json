It\u2019s not unusual for a young Moomintroll to live with their parents way into adult hood, or to never leave at all. If/when a Moomintroll leaves home, they will make sure to live close by and visit often.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p><br/>The Moomin family we know is no exception to this. Moominmamma and Moominpappa do not consider it unusual or bad for Moomintroll to live with them, nor would they prevent him from leaving if he decided to do so. The Moomintroll family in general treats friends as though they were family and will often make accommodations for them even at the expense of their own happiness. \n\nWhen Moominmamma and Moomintroll first find Sniff, they have no problem taking him with them and letting him live with them as a kind of \u2018younger brother\u2019 to Moomintroll. \n\n<br/><br/>Moomintroll himself is especially victim to this over-exertion in order to please others (even helping Stinky eat his own house, for example!) as he hates to displease people and hasn\u2019t developed the knowledge of when to say no that his parents have a slightly better grasp of.\u00a0<br/><br/>\n\nThe Moomin house expands to accommodate all of their closest friends whether that friend is always around or not, and they have no qualms opening up their home to those who are strangers but may soon become friends. All Moomin are like this, as they are creatures who hearts only grow larger to accommodate more people.\n\n<br/><br/>The love of the family is very strong. They protect each other, they support each other, sometimes they might quarrel but they tend to forgive each other very easily. Although one might seek to accuse Mamma and Pappa of\u00a0\u2018babying\u2019 Moomintroll, this is far from the truth. Although they want to make sure he\u2019s prepared for everything, they would never stop him from going off on adventures on his own.\u00a0</p><p>The ideal Moomintroll family includes anywhere from one to four children, but is rarely too large, as extended cousins and friends often take up a lot in a Moomintrolls life, filling the family void.</p><p>It\u2019s hard for Moomintroll to stay mad at his friends, even when they probably deserve it. Not that he won\u2019t tell them off for doing something that upsets him or other people. Moomintroll is the most dependent on others of all the Moomin family, but as he grows he learns the different ways a person can be friends with another and be close to them even when they\u2019re not around.\u00a0</p><h2>Moomintrolls in love.</h2><p>Love for a Moomintroll is very special and rarely comes only once. A young Moomintroll is heavily expected to have a great number of crushes of any gender, whether the object of affection is real or fictional. It\u2019s seen as healthy for them to explore their interests in this manner.\u00a0<br/><br/>However, Moomintrolls are not heartbreakers. They may crush easily but they fall in love only a handful of times. Moominmamma and Pappa are such a case in which the love they feel might look strange to an outsider. They seem to be complete opposites, but in actually the things that are different between them make the similarities feel all that more special. Moomintrolls usually work better with someone who has a lot of differences to them, as it helps to balance out their large personalities. They are fond of holding paws and rubbing noses together as signs of affection.<br/><br/>Moomintroll crushes on pictures, Prima Donna\u2019s and the figureheads of ships. He also feels genuine love for both the Snork Maiden and Snufkin. The Snork Maiden is one of Moomintrolls very first loves. He views her as lovely beyond compare, but often falls short in his gestures to her because of her particular idea about how love and romance is supposed to work. Both of their ideas on the matter are very juvenile and indeed it seems they are just playing at being together, with Snork Maiden happily going off with other would-be boyfriends but delighting in Moomintroll showing grand romantic gestures of jealousy over her. At times, Moomintroll has upset the Snork Maiden through simply not understand the intense masculine role she expects him to play. Other times, he elaborately gushes over her in their play pretend of gender roles and relationship. In the end of the tales as we know them, he remembers her fondly as\u00a0\u2018his friend with the bangle.\u2019<br/><br/>Snufkin is a tricky matter. Moomintroll hasn\u2019t yet gotten to the point where he realises it\u2019s fine to love a person of his own gender. The two are opposites, but get along extremely well. They grow from each other, balancing being alone with being together, learning that it\u2019s ok to love and be loved and that that doesn\u2019t mean smothering each other all of the time. Moomintrolls love is so deep as to become physically sick when Snufkin has gone and Snufkin too starts to feel those affects too. Even when Moomintroll begins to realise his feelings he still has the idea that as a man he can\u2019t admit such feelings for another man\u00a0\u2018one doesn\u2019t say it\u2019 as he says. In time, Moomintroll will realise that it is perfectly ok and if he can warm the heart of a Mumrik he can warm anything.</p>",

If you read something you don&rsquo;t like, kindly move on.</h2><h2>~<br /><br />Moomintrolls with friends and family:</h2><p>Family for a Moomintroll is very important. Extended families often live together in the same stove pipe, or more rarely in homes they&rsquo;ve built themselves in other places. It&rsquo;s not unusual for a young Moomintroll to live with their parents way into adult hood, or to never leave at all. If/when a Moomintroll leaves home, they will make sure to live close by and visit often.&nbsp;</p><p><br />The Moomin family we know is no exception to this. Moominmamma and Moominpappa do not consider it unusual or bad for Moomintroll to live with them, nor would they prevent him from leaving if he decided to do so. The Moomintroll family in general treats friends as though they were family and will often make accommodations for them even at the expense of their own happiness. \n\nWhen Moominmamma and Moomintroll first find Sniff, they have no problem taking him with them and letting him live with them as a kind of &lsquo;younger brother&rsquo; to Moomintroll. \n\n<br /><br />Moomintroll himself is especially victim to this over-exertion in order to please others (even helping Stinky eat his own house, for example!) as he hates to displease people and hasn&rsquo;t developed the knowledge of when to say no that his parents have a slightly better grasp of.&nbsp;<br /><br />\n\nThe Moomin house expands to accommodate all of their closest friends whether that friend is always around or not, and they have no qualms opening up their home to those who are strangers but may soon become friends. All Moomin are like this, as they are creatures who hearts only grow larger to accommodate more people.\n\n<br /><br />The love of the family is very strong. They protect each other, they support each other, sometimes they might quarrel but they tend to forgive each other very easily. Although one might seek to accuse Mamma and Pappa of&nbsp;&lsquo;babying&rsquo; Moomintroll, this is far from the truth. Although they want to make sure he&rsquo;s prepared for everything, they would never stop him from going off on adventures on his own.&nbsp;</p><p>The ideal Moomintroll family includes anywhere from one to four children, but is rarely too large, as extended cousins and friends often take up a lot in a Moomintrolls life, filling the family void.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard for Moomintroll to stay mad at his friends, even when they probably deserve it. Not that he won&rsquo;t tell them off for doing something that upsets him or other people. Moomintroll is the most dependent on others of all the Moomin family, but as he grows he learns the different ways a person can be friends with another and be close to them even when they&rsquo;re not around.&nbsp;</p><h2>Moomintrolls in love.</h2><p>Love for a Moomintroll is very special and rarely comes only once. A young Moomintroll is heavily expected to have a great number of crushes of any gender, whether the object of affection is real or fictional. It&rsquo;s seen as healthy for them to explore their interests in this manner.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, Moomintrolls are not heartbreakers. They may crush easily but they fall in love only a handful of times. Moominmamma and Pappa are such a case in which the love they feel might look strange to an outsider. They seem to be complete opposites, but in actually the things that are different between them make the similarities feel all that more special. Moomintrolls usually work better with someone who has a lot of differences to them, as it helps to balance out their large personalities. They are fond of holding paws and rubbing noses together as signs of affection.<br /><br />Moomintroll crushes on pictures, Prima Donna&rsquo;s and the figureheads of ships. He also feels genuine love for both the Snork Maiden and Snufkin. The Snork Maiden is one of Moomintrolls very first loves. He views her as lovely beyond compare, but often falls short in his gestures to her because of her particular idea about how love and romance is supposed to work. Both of their ideas on the matter are very juvenile and indeed it seems they are just playing at being together, with Snork Maiden happily going off with other would-be boyfriends but delighting in Moomintroll showing grand romantic gestures of jealousy over her. At times, Moomintroll has upset the Snork Maiden through simply not understand the intense masculine role she expects him to play. Other times, he elaborately gushes over her in their play pretend of gender roles and relationship. In the end of the tales as we know them, he remembers her fondly as&nbsp;&lsquo;his friend with the bangle.&rsquo;<br /><br />Snufkin is a tricky matter. Moomintroll hasn&rsquo;t yet gotten to the point where he realises it&rsquo;s fine to love a person of his own gender. The two are opposites, but get along extremely well. They grow from each other, balancing being alone with being together, learning that it&rsquo;s ok to love and be loved and that that doesn&rsquo;t mean smothering each other all of the time. Moomintrolls love is so deep as to become physically sick when Snufkin has gone and Snufkin too starts to feel those affects too. Even when Moomintroll begins to realise his feelings he still has the idea that as a man he can&rsquo;t admit such feelings for another man&nbsp;&lsquo;one doesn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo; as he says. In time, Moomintroll will realise that it is perfectly ok and if he can warm the heart of a Mumrik he can warm anything.</p></p>",
