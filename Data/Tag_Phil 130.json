Enjoy!\n\n<!-- more --></p>\n<p>CHAPTER 9: No Sulking Allowed</p>\n<p>\u201cPhil, come on.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI ordered pizza for dinner!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh come on, you can\u2019t lie on your bed and sulk all day!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil had his back to the door with Dan standing in it, but he could feel Dan rolling his eyes at him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou knew from the very beginning that we couldn\u2019t keep him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil didn\u2019t say anything to that.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sighed. \u201cWell, do what you want. I\u2019ll be in the kitchen eating your pizza.\u201d And with that, Dan was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to lie on his back and stared at the ceiling. Of course he had known that they couldn\u2019t keep Sammy. There was his allergy, for one (which he actually managed quite well with his meds), and also the fact that Sammy clearly was already a domesticated cat. He had to belong to somebody.</p>\n\n<p>But when the vet didn\u2019t find a chip on him, Phil had hoped that Sammy might be a stray cat after all. A very groomed, friendly stray cat, but a homeless cat nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing they had tried had come to fruition, and Phil had been convinced that his only hurdle to keeping Sammy would be Dan. Phil had been sure that he would be able to talk Dan into keeping Sammy, though, because Dan was just as fond of the cat as Phil was (despite everything he always said about not trusting Sammy). Even Sammy loved Dan in his queer little way.</p>\n\n<p>But of course then Kate discovered Phil\u2019s tweet. Phil suddenly wished he had never re-posted that tweet.</p>\n\n<p>Kate had emailed the address Phil had created just for the search. She had written that she had discovered the tweet via one of her students at school, and that she instantly knew that it was her cat. She had described that weirdly star-shaped white patch on Sammy\u2019s belly that really only the owner could know of. She also wrote that she hadn\u2019t chipped him because he was actually supposed to stay indoors, but he had somehow managed to escape the house and ran away.</p>\n\n<p>We thought Pirate might have been killed outdoors, she wrote. I would love for us to arrange a meeting so we can make sure it really is my daughter\u2019s cat.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPirate,\u201d Phil said, his voice dripping with disdain. \u201cWhat a stupid name for a cat.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In truth, Phil thought the name was brilliant, but he would not admit that to his bedroom ceiling.</p>\n\n<p>Phil had shown the message to Dan. He had pursed his lips, and Phil immediately saw that he was just as dismayed by the message than he himself was.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe should call her,\u201d Dan had said eventually. \u201cSee when she can come over to pick up her cat.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you think this is for real?\u201d Phil had asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to call her first and see if she\u2019s for real or not.\u201d Dan had tapped on the screen and indicated the phone number Kate had written under her name.</p>\n\n<p>As Dan refused to talk to people on the phone on principal, Phil had been forced to call Kate. To his utter disappointment, she seemed genuine. She wanted to see \u201cPirate\u201d to be absolutely sure that it was her cat, so they decided that she should come over on Sunday to have a proper look at him.</p>\n\n<p>That was just two days away.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to lie on his side again, hugging his knees to his chest. He stared at his dresser, hard.</p>\n\n<p>Stupid Kate. Stupid Dan. Stupid Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Stupid, stupid Phil!</p>\n\n<p>If Phil had just never let Sammy into the flat, Sammy would have never entered his life. He would have never stolen his bacon, or interrupted his live show, spread cat hair everywhere, cuddle up with him or become friends with Ivy. </p>\n\n<p>He would never have had the chance to worm his way into Phil\u2019s heart and leave it so broken.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it was all Phil\u2019s own fault. He should have left Sammy wailing on his doorstep and just not give a shit.</p>\n\n<p>But it was too late for that now, and Phil just wanted to feel miserable and sorry for himself for at least a little bit. There was enough time to play all adult on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>He closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep. He really didn\u2019t feel like eating dinner, or joining Dan in the lounge. All he felt like was sleeping his sadness away.</p>\n\n<p>However, this was not how his body worked, and Phil lay with his eyes squeezed shut for about two minutes before he groaned and rolled on his back, his arms and legs spread across his bed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is shit,\u201d he said to the ceiling. The ceiling didn\u2019t respond, but Phil was sure it agreed.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, something flung itself next to Phil on the bed. He flinched and turned his head to see Sammy standing right next to him, eyeing him curiously. His tail twitched in the air.</p>\n\n<p>Phil let out a sigh. Sammy knew damn well that he wasn\u2019t allowed to hop on Phil\u2019s bed, but Sammy didn\u2019t seem to care, and quite frankly, Phil didn\u2019t care right now either.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned on his side to face Sammy, throwing his arms out. \u201cCuddles?\u201d he asked, even though he doubted Sammy would actually cuddle up to him.</p>\n\n<p>How wrong he was.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy carefully picked his way over to Phil, turned on the spot, and flung himself against the nook of Phil\u2019s body. Sammy aligned perfectly with Phil\u2019s curved stomach. Phil stared at the cat, wide-eyed. He wasn\u2019t really sure what had happened that he deserved this.</p>\n\n<p>When Sammy started purring, Phil lowered his right hand and let it slide through Sammy\u2019s soft fur. Sammy\u2019s whole body was vibrating, and Phil felt calmed by it. He thought that, maybe, Sammy had sensed that Phil was upset and came over to calm him down? He knew that it was just wishful thinking, though. Sammy was probably just in the mood for cuddles. And yet, Phil liked to believe that Sammy was also thinking of him.</p>\n\n<p>Phil rested his head on his left arm, looking down at Sammy, his hand stroking his little body. The repetitive motion, the soft fur, and the purring soon expelled any other thought from Phil\u2019s mind, until there was only Phil and Sammy. Only the same motion of his hand, the texture of orange fur, and the vibrating little body.</p>\n\n<p>It was only when Dan poked his head into the room that Phil realized that he felt a lot better than before. Not happy about his circumstances, but better. Like he could accept it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou feeling better?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said, his gaze wandering to Sammy, who had decided to stand up and jump down from Phil\u2019s bed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, the pizza\u2019s arrived, so if you feel like dinner&hellip;\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phil said after his stomach gave an audible rumble. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a sec.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan nodded and left. Phil sat up and looked down at Sammy. The cat was sitting next to his bed, looking up at him expectantly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to come out of my room and stop sulking?\u201d Phil asked with a chuckle.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy meowed. Phil\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise. He didn\u2019t feel like he was allowed to protest, so he swung his legs over the edge of the bed and stood up. Sammy got up, too, and led the way into the lounge.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>For some reason both Sammy and Ivy thought it was very necessary to flank Phil on the sofa while he was eating. They didn\u2019t, to both his and Dan\u2019s surprise, beg for scraps. They actually behaved themselves for once and lay next to Phil, dozing peacefully.</p>\n\n<p>Phil and Dan ate their dinner in silence, watching a new episode of Free!. Phil noticed that Dan had ordered Phil\u2019s favourite. He felt a bit teary-eyed from all the attention he got from all of his housemates. He felt so spoilt and grateful, and the cuddles and his favourite food did manage to make him feel a lot better.</p>\n\n<p>Phil still didn\u2019t like the idea of Sammy leaving them for good, but he knew that it had been inevitable, and that Kate \u2013 and her daughter \u2013 must miss their pet terribly. He tried to think about his hamsters and how he would have felt if one had gone missing to then learn that it had been living with someone else all along. This thought helped him to see this last Saturday they would have together as something to look forward to instead of dread.</p>\n\n<p>When the episode was over, Dan grabbed the remote and turned off the telly. Phil watched as he sat back on the sofa, staring at the black screen in front of him. His lips where pressed together in a thin line. Immediately, Ivy sprang up and tried to lick his face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh, no, Ivy!\u201d Dan giggled, ruffling Ivy\u2019s head.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Phil asked.</p>\n\n<p>Dan took hold of Ivy and hugged her close to his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t like the thought of Sammy leaving, either, you know,\u201d Dan said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil said and immediately felt like the worst friend ever. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Phil. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor being a pain in the ass.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan chuckled. \u201cYou only realize now that you are a constant pain in my ass?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil rolled his eyes and shoved at Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHa-ha, very funny.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan shoved him back. \u201cI mean it, you are a constant pain in the ass.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil pursed his lips and crossed his arms in front of his chest. \u201cYeah, thanks. I\u2019m trying to be real for once.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPhil, leave it, really. You have emotions, that\u2019s not something to apologize for.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStill. I didn\u2019t realize that you would miss Sammy, too, and I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked down at Sammy, who had decided to climb on Phil\u2019s lap. \u201cIt\u2019s really odd how fast they grow on you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil looked at Sammy, a smile spreading across his lips. \u201cYeah.\u201d Phil then eyed Ivy, and his grin got wider. \u201cWe still have Ivy, though.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan followed Phil\u2019s gaze and he smiled, too. \u201cYes, we do. And we still got tomorrow with both of these troublemakers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil reached out to scratch that very specific spot behind Sammy\u2019s ears. Sammy instantly began to purr. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe that his actual name is Pirate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Dan said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much cooler than Sammy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They sat there for a while just patting their pets, when the bell rang. Phil and Dan exchanged confused looks.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you expect someone?\u201d Phil asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said, and the bell rang a second time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d Dan jumped off the sofa and tucked Ivy under his arm.</p>\n\n<p>Phil patted Sammy\u2019s head absentmindedly, thinking about who it could be. He didn\u2019t expect any parcels, and it didn\u2019t seem like Dan expected anything either. It was way too late for the postman to arrive anyway. Maybe it was someone wanting to talk about God? Phil immediately felt very grateful that Dan had volunteered to go and see who was at the door.</p>\n\n<p>Phil could hear the door open, Dan\u2019s surprised voice, then someone else\u2019s voice. The door shut again and there was shuffling. Phil craned his neck to get a glimpse through the open door, but the tiny slit didn\u2019t give much away.</p>\n\n<p>Then Dan entered the room, still holding Ivy under his arm. He looked bemused, but not unpleasantly so.</p>\n\n<p>Before Phil could ask who it had been, Sara barreled into the room right after Dan, a huge smile on her face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sara,\u201d Dan said, rather redundantly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey there Phil!\u201d she said, following Dan into the lounge. \u201cSorry to bother you so late, but I was just in the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan said, putting Ivy on the floor and placing his hands on his hips. \u201cCan I get you something?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh no, I\u2019m fine, I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan nodded and sat down on the sofa. Phil motioned for Sara to sit, too, but she just shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m just too excited to sit right now. I have great news!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She planted herself in front of Phil and Dan, putting out her hands in a way that Phil could only describe as a power-pose and said, \u201cI\u2019ve found a new owner for Ivy!\u201d</p>",

Like he could accept it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou feeling better?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said, his gaze wandering to Sammy, who had decided to stand up and jump down from Phil\u2019s bed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, the pizza\u2019s arrived, so if you feel like dinner\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phil said after his stomach gave an audible rumble. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a sec.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan nodded and left. Phil sat up and looked down at Sammy. The cat was sitting next to his bed, looking up at him expectantly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to come out of my room and stop sulking?\u201d Phil asked with a chuckle.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy meowed. Phil\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise. He didn\u2019t feel like he was allowed to protest, so he swung his legs over the edge of the bed and stood up. Sammy got up, too, and led the way into the lounge.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>For some reason both Sammy and Ivy thought it was very necessary to flank Phil on the sofa while he was eating. They didn\u2019t, to both his and Dan\u2019s surprise, beg for scraps. They actually behaved themselves for once and lay next to Phil, dozing peacefully.</p>\n\n<p>Phil and Dan ate their dinner in silence, watching a new episode of Free!. Phil noticed that Dan had ordered Phil\u2019s favourite. He felt a bit teary-eyed from all the attention he got from all of his housemates. He felt so spoilt and grateful, and the cuddles and his favourite food did manage to make him feel a lot better.</p>\n\n<p>Phil still didn\u2019t like the idea of Sammy leaving them for good, but he knew that it had been inevitable, and that Kate \u2013 and her daughter \u2013 must miss their pet terribly. He tried to think about his hamsters and how he would have felt if one had gone missing to then learn that it had been living with someone else all along. This thought helped him to see this last Saturday they would have together as something to look forward to instead of dread.</p>\n\n<p>When the episode was over, Dan grabbed the remote and turned off the telly. Phil watched as he sat back on the sofa, staring at the black screen in front of him. His lips where pressed together in a thin line. Immediately, Ivy sprang up and tried to lick his face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh, no, Ivy!\u201d Dan giggled, ruffling Ivy\u2019s head.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Phil asked.</p>\n\n<p>Dan took hold of Ivy and hugged her close to his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t like the thought of Sammy leaving, either, you know,\u201d Dan said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil said and immediately felt like the worst friend ever. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Phil. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor being a pain in the ass.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan chuckled. \u201cYou only realize now that you are a constant pain in my ass?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil rolled his eyes and shoved at Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHa-ha, very funny.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan shoved him back. \u201cI mean it, you are a constant pain in the ass.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil pursed his lips and crossed his arms in front of his chest. \u201cYeah, thanks. I\u2019m trying to be real for once.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPhil, leave it, really. You have emotions, that\u2019s not something to apologize for.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStill. I didn\u2019t realize that you would miss Sammy, too, and I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked down at Sammy, who had decided to climb on Phil\u2019s lap. \u201cIt\u2019s really odd how fast they grow on you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil looked at Sammy, a smile spreading across his lips. \u201cYeah.\u201d Phil then eyed Ivy, and his grin got wider. \u201cWe still have Ivy, though.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan followed Phil\u2019s gaze and he smiled, too. \u201cYes, we do. And we still got tomorrow with both of these troublemakers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil reached out to scratch that very specific spot behind Sammy\u2019s ears. Sammy instantly began to purr. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe that his actual name is Pirate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Dan said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much cooler than Sammy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They sat there for a while just patting their pets, when the bell rang. Phil and Dan exchanged confused looks.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you expect someone?\u201d Phil asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said, and the bell rang a second time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d Dan jumped off the sofa and tucked Ivy under his arm.</p>\n\n<p>Phil patted Sammy\u2019s head absentmindedly, thinking about who it could be. He didn\u2019t expect any parcels, and it didn\u2019t seem like Dan expected anything either. It was way too late for the postman to arrive anyway. Maybe it was someone wanting to talk about God? Phil immediately felt very grateful that Dan had volunteered to go and see who was at the door.</p>\n\n<p>Phil could hear the door open, Dan\u2019s surprised voice, then someone else\u2019s voice. The door shut again and there was shuffling. Phil craned his neck to get a glimpse through the open door, but the tiny slit didn\u2019t give much away.</p>\n\n<p>Then Dan entered the room, still holding Ivy under his arm. He looked bemused, but not unpleasantly so.</p>\n\n<p>Before Phil could ask who it had been, Sara barreled into the room right after Dan, a huge smile on her face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sara,\u201d Dan said, rather redundantly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey there Phil!\u201d she said, following Dan into the lounge. \u201cSorry to bother you so late, but I was just in the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan said, putting Ivy on the floor and placing his hands on his hips. \u201cCan I get you something?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh no, I\u2019m fine, I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan nodded and sat down on the sofa. Phil motioned for Sara to sit, too, but she just shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m just too excited to sit right now. I have great news!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She planted herself in front of Phil and Dan, putting out her hands in a way that Phil could only describe as a power-pose and said, \u201cI\u2019ve found a new owner for Ivy!\u201d</p></p>",

Enjoy!\n\n[[MORE]]</p>\n<p>CHAPTER 9: No Sulking Allowed</p>\n<p>\u201cPhil, come on.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI ordered pizza for dinner!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh come on, you can\u2019t lie on your bed and sulk all day!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil had his back to the door with Dan standing in it, but he could feel Dan rolling his eyes at him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou knew from the very beginning that we couldn\u2019t keep him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil didn\u2019t say anything to that.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sighed. \u201cWell, do what you want. I\u2019ll be in the kitchen eating your pizza.\u201d And with that, Dan was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to lie on his back and stared at the ceiling. Of course he had known that they couldn\u2019t keep Sammy. There was his allergy, for one (which he actually managed quite well with his meds), and also the fact that Sammy clearly was already a domesticated cat. He had to belong to somebody.</p>\n\n<p>But when the vet didn\u2019t find a chip on him, Phil had hoped that Sammy might be a stray cat after all. A very groomed, friendly stray cat, but a homeless cat nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing they had tried had come to fruition, and Phil had been convinced that his only hurdle to keeping Sammy would be Dan. Phil had been sure that he would be able to talk Dan into keeping Sammy, though, because Dan was just as fond of the cat as Phil was (despite everything he always said about not trusting Sammy). Even Sammy loved Dan in his queer little way.</p>\n\n<p>But of course then Kate discovered Phil\u2019s tweet. Phil suddenly wished he had never re-posted that tweet.</p>\n\n<p>Kate had emailed the address Phil had created just for the search. She had written that she had discovered the tweet via one of her students at school, and that she instantly knew that it was her cat. She had described that weirdly star-shaped white patch on Sammy\u2019s belly that really only the owner could know of. She also wrote that she hadn\u2019t chipped him because he was actually supposed to stay indoors, but he had somehow managed to escape the house and ran away.</p>\n\n<p>We thought Pirate might have been killed outdoors, she wrote. I would love for us to arrange a meeting so we can make sure it really is my daughter\u2019s cat.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPirate,\u201d Phil said, his voice dripping with disdain. \u201cWhat a stupid name for a cat.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In truth, Phil thought the name was brilliant, but he would not admit that to his bedroom ceiling.</p>\n\n<p>Phil had shown the message to Dan. He had pursed his lips, and Phil immediately saw that he was just as dismayed by the message than he himself was.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe should call her,\u201d Dan had said eventually. \u201cSee when she can come over to pick up her cat.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you think this is for real?\u201d Phil had asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to call her first and see if she\u2019s for real or not.\u201d Dan had tapped on the screen and indicated the phone number Kate had written under her name.</p>\n\n<p>As Dan refused to talk to people on the phone on principal, Phil had been forced to call Kate. To his utter disappointment, she seemed genuine. She wanted to see \u201cPirate\u201d to be absolutely sure that it was her cat, so they decided that she should come over on Sunday to have a proper look at him.</p>\n\n<p>That was just two days away.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to lie on his side again, hugging his knees to his chest. He stared at his dresser, hard.</p>\n\n<p>Stupid Kate. Stupid Dan. Stupid Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Stupid, stupid Phil!</p>\n\n<p>If Phil had just never let Sammy into the flat, Sammy would have never entered his life. He would have never stolen his bacon, or interrupted his live show, spread cat hair everywhere, cuddle up with him or become friends with Ivy. </p>\n\n<p>He would never have had the chance to worm his way into Phil\u2019s heart and leave it so broken.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it was all Phil\u2019s own fault. He should have left Sammy wailing on his doorstep and just not give a shit.</p>\n\n<p>But it was too late for that now, and Phil just wanted to feel miserable and sorry for himself for at least a little bit. There was enough time to play all adult on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>He closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep. He really didn\u2019t feel like eating dinner, or joining Dan in the lounge. All he felt like was sleeping his sadness away.</p>\n\n<p>However, this was not how his body worked, and Phil lay with his eyes squeezed shut for about two minutes before he groaned and rolled on his back, his arms and legs spread across his bed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is shit,\u201d he said to the ceiling. The ceiling didn\u2019t respond, but Phil was sure it agreed.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, something flung itself next to Phil on the bed. He flinched and turned his head to see Sammy standing right next to him, eyeing him curiously. His tail twitched in the air.</p>\n\n<p>Phil let out a sigh. Sammy knew damn well that he wasn\u2019t allowed to hop on Phil\u2019s bed, but Sammy didn\u2019t seem to care, and quite frankly, Phil didn\u2019t care right now either.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned on his side to face Sammy, throwing his arms out. \u201cCuddles?\u201d he asked, even though he doubted Sammy would actually cuddle up to him.</p>\n\n<p>How wrong he was.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy carefully picked his way over to Phil, turned on the spot, and flung himself against the nook of Phil\u2019s body. Sammy aligned perfectly with Phil\u2019s curved stomach. Phil stared at the cat, wide-eyed. He wasn\u2019t really sure what had happened that he deserved this.</p>\n\n<p>When Sammy started purring, Phil lowered his right hand and let it slide through Sammy\u2019s soft fur. Sammy\u2019s whole body was vibrating, and Phil felt calmed by it. He thought that, maybe, Sammy had sensed that Phil was upset and came over to calm him down? He knew that it was just wishful thinking, though. Sammy was probably just in the mood for cuddles. And yet, Phil liked to believe that Sammy was also thinking of him.</p>\n\n<p>Phil rested his head on his left arm, looking down at Sammy, his hand stroking his little body. The repetitive motion, the soft fur, and the purring soon expelled any other thought from Phil\u2019s mind, until there was only Phil and Sammy. Only the same motion of his hand, the texture of orange fur, and the vibrating little body.</p>\n\n<p>It was only when Dan poked his head into the room that Phil realized that he felt a lot better than before. Not happy about his circumstances, but better. Like he could accept it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou feeling better?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said, his gaze wandering to Sammy, who had decided to stand up and jump down from Phil\u2019s bed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, the pizza\u2019s arrived, so if you feel like dinner\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phil said after his stomach gave an audible rumble. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a sec.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan nodded and left.

The cat was sitting next to his bed, looking up at him expectantly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to come out of my room and stop sulking?\u201d Phil asked with a chuckle.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy meowed.

Enjoy!\n\n</p>\n<p>CHAPTER 9: No Sulking Allowed</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Phil, come on.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I ordered pizza for dinner!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh come on, you can&rsquo;t lie on your bed and sulk all day!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil had his back to the door with Dan standing in it, but he could feel Dan rolling his eyes at him.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You knew from the very beginning that we couldn&rsquo;t keep him.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil didn&rsquo;t say anything to that.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sighed. &ldquo;Well, do what you want. I&rsquo;ll be in the kitchen eating your pizza.&rdquo; And with that, Dan was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to lie on his back and stared at the ceiling. Of course he had known that they couldn&rsquo;t keep Sammy. There was his allergy, for one (which he actually managed quite well with his meds), and also the fact that Sammy clearly was already a domesticated cat. He had to belong to somebody.</p>\n\n<p>But when the vet didn&rsquo;t find a chip on him, Phil had hoped that Sammy might be a stray cat after all. A very groomed, friendly stray cat, but a homeless cat nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing they had tried had come to fruition, and Phil had been convinced that his only hurdle to keeping Sammy would be Dan. Phil had been sure that he would be able to talk Dan into keeping Sammy, though, because Dan was just as fond of the cat as Phil was (despite everything he always said about not trusting Sammy). Even Sammy loved Dan in his queer little way.</p>\n\n<p>But of course then Kate discovered Phil&rsquo;s tweet. Phil suddenly wished he had never re-posted that tweet.</p>\n\n<p>Kate had emailed the address Phil had created just for the search. She had written that she had discovered the tweet via one of her students at school, and that she instantly knew that it was her cat. She had described that weirdly star-shaped white patch on Sammy&rsquo;s belly that really only the owner could know of. She also wrote that she hadn&rsquo;t chipped him because he was actually supposed to stay indoors, but he had somehow managed to escape the house and ran away.</p>\n\n<p>We thought Pirate might have been killed outdoors, she wrote. I would love for us to arrange a meeting so we can make sure it really is my daughter&rsquo;s cat.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Pirate,&rdquo; Phil said, his voice dripping with disdain. &ldquo;What a stupid name for a cat.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In truth, Phil thought the name was brilliant, but he would not admit that to his bedroom ceiling.</p>\n\n<p>Phil had shown the message to Dan. He had pursed his lips, and Phil immediately saw that he was just as dismayed by the message than he himself was.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We should call her,&rdquo; Dan had said eventually. &ldquo;See when she can come over to pick up her cat.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Do you think this is for real?&rdquo; Phil had asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going to call her first and see if she&rsquo;s for real or not.&rdquo; Dan had tapped on the screen and indicated the phone number Kate had written under her name.</p>\n\n<p>As Dan refused to talk to people on the phone on principal, Phil had been forced to call Kate. To his utter disappointment, she seemed genuine. She wanted to see &ldquo;Pirate&rdquo; to be absolutely sure that it was her cat, so they decided that she should come over on Sunday to have a proper look at him.</p>\n\n<p>That was just two days away.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to lie on his side again, hugging his knees to his chest. He stared at his dresser, hard.</p>\n\n<p>Stupid Kate. Stupid Dan. Stupid Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Stupid, stupid Phil!</p>\n\n<p>If Phil had just never let Sammy into the flat, Sammy would have never entered his life. He would have never stolen his bacon, or interrupted his live show, spread cat hair everywhere, cuddle up with him or become friends with Ivy. </p>\n\n<p>He would never have had the chance to worm his way into Phil&rsquo;s heart and leave it so broken.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it was all Phil&rsquo;s own fault. He should have left Sammy wailing on his doorstep and just not give a shit.</p>\n\n<p>But it was too late for that now, and Phil just wanted to feel miserable and sorry for himself for at least a little bit. There was enough time to play all adult on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>He closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep. He really didn&rsquo;t feel like eating dinner, or joining Dan in the lounge. All he felt like was sleeping his sadness away.</p>\n\n<p>However, this was not how his body worked, and Phil lay with his eyes squeezed shut for about two minutes before he groaned and rolled on his back, his arms and legs spread across his bed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is shit,&rdquo; he said to the ceiling. The ceiling didn&rsquo;t respond, but Phil was sure it agreed.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, something flung itself next to Phil on the bed. He flinched and turned his head to see Sammy standing right next to him, eyeing him curiously. His tail twitched in the air.</p>\n\n<p>Phil let out a sigh. Sammy knew damn well that he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to hop on Phil&rsquo;s bed, but Sammy didn&rsquo;t seem to care, and quite frankly, Phil didn&rsquo;t care right now either.</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned on his side to face Sammy, throwing his arms out. &ldquo;Cuddles?&rdquo; he asked, even though he doubted Sammy would actually cuddle up to him.</p>\n\n<p>How wrong he was.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy carefully picked his way over to Phil, turned on the spot, and flung himself against the nook of Phil&rsquo;s body. Sammy aligned perfectly with Phil&rsquo;s curved stomach. Phil stared at the cat, wide-eyed. He wasn&rsquo;t really sure what had happened that he deserved this.</p>\n\n<p>When Sammy started purring, Phil lowered his right hand and let it slide through Sammy&rsquo;s soft fur. Sammy&rsquo;s whole body was vibrating, and Phil felt calmed by it. He thought that, maybe, Sammy had sensed that Phil was upset and came over to calm him down? He knew that it was just wishful thinking, though. Sammy was probably just in the mood for cuddles. And yet, Phil liked to believe that Sammy was also thinking of him.</p>\n\n<p>Phil rested his head on his left arm, looking down at Sammy, his hand stroking his little body. The repetitive motion, the soft fur, and the purring soon expelled any other thought from Phil&rsquo;s mind, until there was only Phil and Sammy. Only the same motion of his hand, the texture of orange fur, and the vibrating little body.</p>\n\n<p>It was only when Dan poked his head into the room that Phil realized that he felt a lot better than before. Not happy about his circumstances, but better. Like he could accept it.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You feeling better?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil said, his gaze wandering to Sammy, who had decided to stand up and jump down from Phil&rsquo;s bed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, the pizza&rsquo;s arrived, so if you feel like dinner&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Phil said after his stomach gave an audible rumble. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a sec.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan nodded and left. Phil sat up and looked down at Sammy. The cat was sitting next to his bed, looking up at him expectantly.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to come out of my room and stop sulking?&rdquo; Phil asked with a chuckle.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy meowed. Phil&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up in surprise. He didn&rsquo;t feel like he was allowed to protest, so he swung his legs over the edge of the bed and stood up. Sammy got up, too, and led the way into the lounge.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>For some reason both Sammy and Ivy thought it was very necessary to flank Phil on the sofa while he was eating. They didn&rsquo;t, to both his and Dan&rsquo;s surprise, beg for scraps. They actually behaved themselves for once and lay next to Phil, dozing peacefully.</p>\n\n<p>Phil and Dan ate their dinner in silence, watching a new episode of Free!. Phil noticed that Dan had ordered Phil&rsquo;s favourite. He felt a bit teary-eyed from all the attention he got from all of his housemates. He felt so spoilt and grateful, and the cuddles and his favourite food did manage to make him feel a lot better.</p>\n\n<p>Phil still didn&rsquo;t like the idea of Sammy leaving them for good, but he knew that it had been inevitable, and that Kate &ndash; and her daughter &ndash; must miss their pet terribly. He tried to think about his hamsters and how he would have felt if one had gone missing to then learn that it had been living with someone else all along. This thought helped him to see this last Saturday they would have together as something to look forward to instead of dread.</p>\n\n<p>When the episode was over, Dan grabbed the remote and turned off the telly. Phil watched as he sat back on the sofa, staring at the black screen in front of him. His lips where pressed together in a thin line. Immediately, Ivy sprang up and tried to lick his face.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, Ivy!&rdquo; Dan giggled, ruffling Ivy&rsquo;s head.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p>\n\n<p>Dan took hold of Ivy and hugged her close to his chest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the thought of Sammy leaving, either, you know,&rdquo; Dan said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Phil said and immediately felt like the worst friend ever. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Phil. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For being a pain in the ass.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan chuckled. &ldquo;You only realize now that you are a constant pain in my ass?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil rolled his eyes and shoved at Dan&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Ha-ha, very funny.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan shoved him back. &ldquo;I mean it, you are a constant pain in the ass.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil pursed his lips and crossed his arms in front of his chest. &ldquo;Yeah, thanks. I&rsquo;m trying to be real for once.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Phil, leave it, really. You have emotions, that&rsquo;s not something to apologize for.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Still. I didn&rsquo;t realize that you would miss Sammy, too, and I&rsquo;m sorry for that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked down at Sammy, who had decided to climb on Phil&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really odd how fast they grow on you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil looked at Sammy, a smile spreading across his lips. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Phil then eyed Ivy, and his grin got wider. &ldquo;We still have Ivy, though.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan followed Phil&rsquo;s gaze and he smiled, too. &ldquo;Yes, we do. And we still got tomorrow with both of these troublemakers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil reached out to scratch that very specific spot behind Sammy&rsquo;s ears. Sammy instantly began to purr. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe that his actual name is Pirate.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Me, neither,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much cooler than Sammy.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Right?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>They sat there for a while just patting their pets, when the bell rang. Phil and Dan exchanged confused looks.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Do you expect someone?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan said, and the bell rang a second time.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo; Dan jumped off the sofa and tucked Ivy under his arm.</p>\n\n<p>Phil patted Sammy&rsquo;s head absentmindedly, thinking about who it could be. He didn&rsquo;t expect any parcels, and it didn&rsquo;t seem like Dan expected anything either. It was way too late for the postman to arrive anyway. Maybe it was someone wanting to talk about God? Phil immediately felt very grateful that Dan had volunteered to go and see who was at the door.</p>\n\n<p>Phil could hear the door open, Dan&rsquo;s surprised voice, then someone else&rsquo;s voice. The door shut again and there was shuffling. Phil craned his neck to get a glimpse through the open door, but the tiny slit didn&rsquo;t give much away.</p>\n\n<p>Then Dan entered the room, still holding Ivy under his arm. He looked bemused, but not unpleasantly so.</p>\n\n<p>Before Phil could ask who it had been, Sara barreled into the room right after Dan, a huge smile on her face.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sara,&rdquo; Dan said, rather redundantly.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hey there Phil!&rdquo; she said, following Dan into the lounge. &ldquo;Sorry to bother you so late, but I was just in the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Dan said, putting Ivy on the floor and placing his hands on his hips. &ldquo;Can I get you something?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;m fine, I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan nodded and sat down on the sofa. Phil motioned for Sara to sit, too, but she just shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just too excited to sit right now. I have great news!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>She planted herself in front of Phil and Dan, putting out her hands in a way that Phil could only describe as a power-pose and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a new owner for Ivy!&rdquo;</p></p>",
