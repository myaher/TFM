Finding each other in a crowd, letting the other know that dinner was ready without having to search the entire castle. The most urgent use of it had been when a then-seven-year-old Crispin had wandered off during a trip to Emon, and that was nearly a decade past. </p><p>It was for this reason that Percy\u2019s initial reaction to Vex\u2019s cry was one of confusion. The look was mirrored in his friend\u2019s faces, as was the sinking dread as they all processed what she\u2019d said. He saw Scanlan\u2019s eyes take on the fierce coldness they always did whenever they\u2019d come across goblins, saw Pike look at the children with a growing look of the same fear Percy felt, saw Keyleth take in all the visitors and civilians just passing through the town square or setting up their stands. </p><p>Of all the worst possible settings for an attack\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Percy said, grasping his own earring. As if his voice had been a sign, the others sprang into action, Grog and Pike rushing to fetch their weapons from respective bags. Percy pulled Tiffany off of Trinket\u2019s back as the bear stood, and handed her off to Crispin, who\u2019d been staring with trepidation at the adults in their sudden stillness. \u201cTake your siblings and get into an inn, tell them to brace for a fight,\u201d he said. </p><p>Whitestone had learned from the Briarwoods and the Chroma Conclave. They\u2019d made plans for future attacks, the people needed only to be alerted and they would react as needed. </p><p>(Except they hadn\u2019t actually needed such strategies in decades, and those strategies had assumed that the threat would come from outside, not from the very heart of the city, and they didn\u2019t account for all these visitors, they needed more time to prepare, <i>how in the Nine Hells did goblins get into the heart of Whitestone\u2014</i>) </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one in the storeroom, I\u2019ve got it trapped!\u201d Vex\u2019s voice drew Percy out of his thoughts. Fuck it, they\u2019d have to trust that those who remembered those dark times would guide those who didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with the kids and help direct people to safety,\u201d Pike said, wrenching her mace free. Then, at the top of her lungs: \u201cEveryone get inside, hurry! Keep your kids close! Goblin attack!\u201d Crispin, who had looked ready to ask his father for a further explanation, turned white at Pike\u2019s call and nodded mutely at Percy, grabbing Arthur by the hand and hoarsely telling the other two to stay close. </p><p>Keyleth grabbed Percy\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get in the air and see if I can\u2019t keep an eye on things, maybe signal to the guards where the rest of the attack is,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Percy said, \u201cStay safe.\u201d She pulled away, her form effortlessly shifting into the familiar golden feathers of a giant eagle, and launched herself into the air. Percy looked to Grog and Scanlan and gestured for them to follow him; he didn\u2019t have any weapons on him, but they didn\u2019t know where the storeroom was, and as sure as he was that a single goblin posed no threat for Vex, even unarmed, it was never just one goblin for long. Trinket seemed to agree, the bear already rumbling past. </p><p>The storehouse wasn\u2019t far, but the journey was made difficult by people rushing past in a panic, despite the best efforts of one or two guards and the normal townsfolk to usher them to safely. Word was spreading quickly, it seemed. Trinket, focused purely on coming to Vex\u2019s rescue, cleared enough of a path just by charging past that they still arrived quickly enough. </p><p>Upon rounding the final corner, Percy spotted two guards rushing to help his wife, who was holding the door closed. Another bit of movement caught his eye, however; something small and dark was pushing itself through the small, high window on the opposite side of the storehouse from the door. </p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d he shouted, pointing. The creature turned two huge yellow eyes toward the sound and yelped, struggling even more to squeeze through. \u201cIt\u2019s climbing out the window!\u201d </p><p>Scanlan launched a blast of lightning the goblin\u2019s way just as it managed to slip out of the window, the bolt crashing by it harmlessly and striking the stone wall of the storehouse. The goblin scrambled to its feet and dashed in a headlong sprint down the alley, Grog and Scanlan both rushing in pursuit. The two guards who\u2019d run to Vex stopped by her for a moment, but her angry gesture sent them joining in the chase. </p><p>Percy grabbed Vex by the arm, trying to keep terror from turning his grip into a vice and failing entirely. \u201cAre you hurt at all?\u201d he asked, frantic. \u201cDid it attack you, are you\u2014\u201c </p><p>(He\u2019d seen the aftermath of goblin attacks. Parents devastated by watching their children dragged away screaming, houses ransacked, bodies mangled and in some cases <i>eaten, </i>he\u2019d seen what goblins could do to people who were caught unawares, and for everything he\u2019d seen with his own eyes he\u2019d heard dozens of stories about even worse deeds. In his mind he could see all of it, all the horrors and violence, superimposed over Whitestone, over the visitors, over his own children\u2014) </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fucking fantastic when we\u2019ve killed a few bloody goblins,\u201d Vex snapped, pushing some hair out of her face. Trinket pressed his head under her free hand and moaned. \u201cYes, darling, I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m okay, it never got the chance to so much as touch me. Gods dammit, how\u2019d the little bastards get this far in past our defenses?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Percy said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to investigate after we\u2019ve repelled the initial attack. Hopefully we don\u2019t have too many casualties, but with this many strangers in town\u2014the kids are safe, at least, they\u2019ve got Pike with them, but\u2014\u201c </p><p>\u201cRight, the kids,\u201d Vex said. \u201cI\u2014good, that\u2019s good. Gods, of all things to go wrong today\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should fetch Scanlan and Grog, for now, and regroup. They\u2019ve probably dealt with the one you spotted, and we need to help the town brace for the full attack.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Vex nodded. Her eyes focused and hardened. \u201cGods damn them for attacking when I\u2019ve left Fenthras at home, but we can deal with that, I can make do with any bow in a pinch.\u201d Trinket grunted his agreement.</p><p>Instead of the expected bloodbath, however, what Vex and Percy found in the intersection of two alleys was the guards scratching their heads, Grog looking disappointed, and Scanlan looking <i>livid. </i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Vex asked, looking around. </p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Grog. \u201cIt got away. Not sure where it went.\u201d </p><p>Percy stopped and stared at the goliath. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014you were outrun by a <i>goblin?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d </p><p>Trinket sniffed the air, growling softly before lumbering toward a stack of half-broken crates someone had discarded. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to imply anything bad, Grog, I just\u2014that\u2019s really surprising,\u201d Percy said, holding his hands up reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re just as fast as ever, maybe you just got unlucky.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo be fair, it was a pretty damn quick little runt,\u201d Scanlan grumbled. \u201cProbably got spooked and ran off to rejoin the rest of them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrinket, darling, don\u2019t eat that,\u201d Vex said absently, as the bear pawed at one of the crates. </p><p>Percy nodded, then turned to the two guards, who stood to attention. \u201cOrganize a search,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you send the word out, too, as you go? Tell any stragglers to get inside? Quickly, please, there\u2019s no telling how much time left we\u2019ve got.\u201d </p><p>The guards nodded, and sped off. \u201cI\u2019m sure Keyleth\u2019ll make lots of noise if she spots the main force,\u201d Vex said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care how fast this goblin is, none of them are going to outrun her when she\u2019s in the sky\u2014Trinket, I told you, there\u2019s nothing to eat in there, stop that, you\u2019re going to get a nose full of splinters.\u201d </p><p>The bear grunted, but ignored Vex, continuing to push aside some of the partly rotted wood. There was a crack in the wall behind the pile of crates, now that Percy looked. \u201cOf course he\u2019s looking for food while we\u2019re under attack,\u201d Scanlan grumbled, tail lashing. \u201cFuck, we don\u2019t even know which way the little devil went! I can\u2019t believe we lost it, the blasted\u2014\u201d</p><p>All at once, Trinket went entirely stiff, his occasional grunting replaced by a low, rumbling growl that seemed to vibrate through the very ground. </p><p>\u2026In fact, if he looked closely, the crack might just be big enough for someone very small to squeeze into, should they need to disappear from sight.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Good bear, Trinket,\u201d said Vex, slowly. All four of them changed their stances; Grog stood, a grin splitting his face at the prospect of a return the hunt. Magic swirled around Scanlan\u2019s fingertips, shimmering violet smoke beginning to form into fingers beneath him. Vex and Percy, unarmed, braced themselves. </p><p>Trinket shoved his face into the crack as hard as he could, his jaws audibly snapping, only to then pull back with a roar, a thin line of blood dripping off his muzzle as he reared up. The goblin was a blur of shadows as it took the brief opportunity to zip past, narrowly avoiding the bear\u2019s claws as he thudded back down onto the ground. Percy and Vex both lurched in an attempt to grab the goblin as it sped past, but it dodged away out of reach, narrowly darting under Grog\u2019s axe by fractions of an inch and speeding past. Scanlan sprang up on Bigby\u2019s hand, but the goblin had somehow gotten all the way past them, and was scrambling over a fence between two buildings. </p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019ll get away that easily, you\u2019re in for a <i>shock!</i>\u201d Scanlan shouted, magic crackling around his hand. Lightning slammed into where the goblin should have been, blasting a hole in the fence and setting it ablaze, but somehow, the goblin had shifted, narrowly avoiding what seemed like <i>all </i>of the damage from the strike. With a panicked yelp, it disappeared over the fence, the sound of its retreating footsteps almost inaudible over the crackling flames. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/998d385ebfadd83d8cec0b32ba5e1132/tumblr_inline_pfzpmcwrgL1r1p1hw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"/></figure><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t!\u201d Scanlan shouted, soaring on Bigby\u2019s hand over the fence. With a bellow, Grog followed suit, knocking a hole in the fence with his axe rather than bothering with climbing over it. </p><p>Vex moved to chase as well, but Percy grabbed her arm. \u201cVex,\u201d he said, \u201cVex, we need to deal with things elsewhere\u2014we don\u2019t even have our weapons, there\u2019s not much we can do, leave them to it.\u201d </p><p>With a frustrated noise, Vex tugged her arm away and gestured at Trinket, who was attempting to lick at the thin scratch across the bridge of his muzzle. \u201cLook at your poor face, gods dammit\u2014let\u2019s just\u2026go help where we can, I suppose,\u201d she said. </p><p>Another blast of magic burst audibly some distance away. \u201cSounds like they\u2019ve got that one squared away without us, anyhow,\u201d Percy muttered.</p><hr><p>\u2018Nervous\u2019 was not often a word applicable to the members of the Grey Hunt, but right now, anxiety lingered on all of their faces as they silently watched Vex\u2019ahlia pace in front of them. \u00a0Percy had joined some guards to investigate the storehouse, Scanlan and Grog were still off helping in the search for the main force of the goblins, Keyleth and Pike remained as they were, and Vex was doing some investigating of her own.<br/></p><p>Well, more of an <i>interrogation </i>than an investigation. Percy had his way of seeking answers, and she had hers. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, pausing, arms crossed. \u201cWould any of you would like to explain to me how this happened, exactly?\u201d </p><p>The hunters looked at each other, and one spoke up. \u201cMy lady?\u201d he said, and Vex felt cold fury rise within her at the tentative, yet genuine confusion in his voice. </p><p>\u201cThe bloody goblins!\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou all have one job, one <i>fucking </i>job\u2014to keep watch over the damned Patchwood. There should have been no way that we find out about goblins only when one breaks into a storeroom in the heart of the fucking city!\u201d Several of the hunters cringed at the outburst. Was the guilt she saw sincere or imagined? Who cared, who cared, they <i>should</i> feel guilty\u2014\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I hear any reports about goblin clan movements in the area? We should have heard about this before they reached the fucking farmlands, nevermind the center of town!\u201d <i>It never should have gotten the chance to fool me into\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cLady Vex\u2019ahlia,\u201d said one of the hunters, holding out her hand. She was the only one who\u2019d been around longer than Vex at this point, actually; she\u2019d been a hunter even before the Briarwoods had come, and had helped her greatly with settling into the position of Grand Mistress. \u201cMy Lady, I understand that you\u2019re worried\u2014we all are, and with fair reason. However, I assure you, no one here would dare slack off under your watch. You\u2019ve trained this lot well. If there were no reports of goblins in the area, it\u2019s because none were observed, and we have observed the Patchwood as carefully as ever.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere was a weird burst of magic a couple weeks ago, but all we found when we checked was a bunch of angry bluecoats,\u201d one of the youngest hunters mumbled. </p><p>\u201cAye, and that a fair distance from the city,\u201d said the eldest of the hunters. Vex huffed, but took a deep breath. This was true\u2014she\u2019d remembered that report; she\u2019d not been part of the team that investigated, but she knew that it had been handled carefully and turned out to be nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t know how these goblins got in, but we will find out how they slipped past us,\u201d she continued. </p><p>\u201cSee to it that you do,\u201d Vex said, dismissing them with a frustrated wave of her hand. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even find a bunch of bloody <i>goblins, </i>then we\u2019ve got a real problem on our hands.\u201d </p><p>As the Hunt dispersed, Vex pinched the bridge of her nose. Bloody <i>goblins, </i>of all things to have to deal with\u2014</p><p>Trinket nudged her arm and moaned softly. Absently, she patted the top of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, buddy,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s only goblins. Nothing we can\u2019t handle. Just have to find the bloody things\u2026\u201d </p><p>Shaking herself, she moved towards the tavern Pike had taken the kids to; they\u2019d agreed over the earrings to meet up here again to compare notes in about ten minutes. Not that she\u2019d have much to offer, just the word of a toddler and the news that the Hunt had apparently missed an entire tribe of goblins. Gods. </p><p>What a nightmare. </p><p>The others trickled toward the rendezvous point slowly, Pike coming first after Cassandra stopped by to pick up the kids and usher them all towards the castle. Percy joined them next, looking very thoughtful; Keyleth swooped down and landed next, her own face worried. </p><p>\u201cDid you catch sight of them?\u201d Percy asked her. </p><p>Keyleth shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s the weird thing,\u201d she started, \u201cI only\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud, gruff stream of swearing cut her off, as Grog stomped up, Scanlan looking irritable at his side. </p><p>\u201cLittle fuck got away again!\u201d Grog griped, swinging his axe up to rest on one shoulder. \u201cI nearly \u2018ad it one second, and the next, it was just gone!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt ran between your legs while you were busy overswinging,\u201d Scanlan scowled. \u201cAnd <i>then </i>it disappeared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even get the first goblin?\u201d Pike asked, genuinely confused. Percy paused in whatever thoughts had him distracted long enough to fill Pike in on what she\u2019d missed whilst guarding the kids.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfd71aa82e14435ee6477e0296afe52f/tumblr_inline_pfzpn9mJxB1r1p1hw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"/></figure><p>\u201cIt was really fast, Pike!\u201d Grog whined. </p><p>\u201cAnd very strange,\u201d said Percy. \u201cThe storehouse was full of all kinds of food, albeit not as much as there was before winter, but there was plenty of dried meats, and none of it very well hidden. Yet as far as I can tell, this goblin was evidently only interested in a bunch of herbs, for some reason. The bags they\u2019d been stored in had been ripped open, and there were scraps of them everywhere.\u201d </p><p>Scanlan gestured questioningly at Percy. \u201cSo it made a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a goblin. They do that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but what use do goblins have for cooking herbs?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re getting tired of only putting salt and pepper on their grandma stew.\u201d <br/><br/>\n\u201cScanlan!\u201d Pike hissed. </p><p>Vex was barely processing most of the conversation, staring off into the distance and letting the words fly around her. The first goblin\u2019s escape grated on her nerves. The thought of the little impost\u2014<i>intruder </i>getting away untouched burned her. Sweet Sarenrae, it was one bloody goblin, surely they could at least track it to wherever the rest were hiding? They\u2019d all brought down a would-be god, but <i>goblins </i>were giving them this much trouble?</p><p>\u201cWell, Kiki, you can still point us toward the rest, right?\u201d Grog\u2019s hopeful voice brought her marginally back to the present. No doubt he was looking forward to the chance to fight something. For once, Vex found herself in similar shoes. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was saying when you guys got here,\u201d Keyleth said. \u201cI scanned the whole city as best I could several times, but I only ever saw the one goblin. I don\u2019t know if there <i>are </i>any others here.\u201d </p><p>Scanlan rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never just one goblin, there\u2019s got to be others!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t see any,\u201d said Keyleth, leaning forward with a worried stare. </p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get distracted by anything?\u201d Vex said. \u201cNothing caught in your eye?\u201d</p><p>Keyleth looked hurt. \u201cI was\u2014I tried to be really thorough, and I\u2019m telling you, there was only one goblin!\u201d </p><p>Vex sighed. She\u2019d really meant to keep the scorn out of her voice, there. Keyleth didn\u2019t deserve it, she was just\u2014angry. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you were, I\u2019m sorry, darling. I\u2019m just\u2026stressed out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you at least see which way the first one went?\u201d Scanlan asked. </p><p>Keyleth shifted and shook her head. \u201cI was searching a different part of the city when you two lost track of it, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, guys.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sakes,\u201d Grog growled, letting the head of his axe thump down. </p><p>Scanlan scoffed. \u201cDidn\u2019t see where the first one went, didn\u2019t see the others, maybe you were distracted! Were you paying attention at all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cScanlan,\u201d Percy said, a warning in his voice. </p><p>\u201cGuys, hey, don\u2019t do this now,\u201d Pike cautioned. </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Keyleth snapped. \u201cI didn\u2019t fly up to just fuck around, guys, I was really searching hard! There was only one goblin, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d said Keyleth. </p><p>\u201cIt must have been a scout, then,\u201d Vex said, rolling her eyes. \u201cRight? It was very quick, and, Scanlan, you said before that it was a small one?\u201d </p><p>Scanlan shrugged. \u201cHard to tell under the cloak, but it seemed like it was on the small side for a goblin, yeah.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we found it where we keep the food. There you are, then, it must\u2019ve been a scout,\u201d Vex continued. \u201cIt was sent in ahead of the main force to find out where we keep everything, since it\u2019s quick and good at disappearing, evidently. Explains everything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlmost everything,\u201d said Percy. \u201cExcept for the herbs, which I still don\u2019t get\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes it really matter why it was digging around through something weird?\u201d Scanlan groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s a goblin, Percy, who knows what it was thinking.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026I suppose it probably doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said, still looking thoughtful. He shook his head. \u201cWell, if this was a scout, then the main attack is yet to happen. We\u2019ll have to ask everyone to do a head count on their families, check that their kids are safe, and brace to be hit at a later date\u2026Probably tomorrow, now that I think about it. During a festival would be the time to attack. Although\u2026whether or not the goblins actually know that we\u2019re having a festival is another question entirely, but\u2026regardless, we\u2019d all best make sure we\u2019re rested up tonight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe guards will probably have tracked the goblins down by next morning,\u201d Vex said, waving her hand irritably. </p><p>\u201cRight, but if they don\u2019t,\u201d said Percy, \u201cWe\u2019ll all want to make sure we\u2019re at the top of our game. Anyone who can fight will need to be ready to defend those who can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not\u2026we\u2019re not going through with the festival with goblins nearby, are we?\u201d said Keyleth. </p><p>Percy sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking with the captain of the guard, and the guards have all been checking in with the townsfolk. A lot of the visitors are scared, but most of the residents are all of the opinion that they\u2019re not about to take this without a fight. They\u2019re determined to celebrate, whether we in charge like it or not, and plenty of people have already volunteered to act as a militia to help bolster defenses.\u201d He shot Keyleth a tired grin. \u201cSome of those old enough to remember the Briarwoods have been especially vocal about not hiding away from a threat, and I can\u2019t find it in me to tell them they\u2019re wrong.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cWe\u2019ll\u2026just have to do the best we can, and hope they do track down and destroy the main force before it strikes.\u201d </p><p>Keyleth bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d she murmured. </p><p>\u201cHas anyone been reported missing?\u201d Pike said. \u201cThat\u2019s my first worry, that maybe these ones are sneaky enough to take people quietly, since they\u2019ve avoided detection so far.\u201d </p><p>Percy shook his head. \u201cNot everyone\u2019s done a head count, mind you, but so far everyone seems to be accounted for.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey better fuckin\u2019 attack tomorrow,\u201d Grog grumbled. \u201cGot all worked up for a fight and then the fuckin\u2019 goblin got away.\u201d </p><p>Pike patted his knee. \u201cAw, buddy,\u201d she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll find you somebody to spar with, I promise.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Grog complained. \u201cI was hopin\u2019 for a proper fight and some killing and everything, and the stupid slippery little goblin got away!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we can\u2019t do any killing, but you and me can go visit Vasselheim soon, maybe, go defend our titles?\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026I guess,\u201d Grog said, scuffing the ground. </p><p>\u201cWho knows, maybe the guards\u2019ll miss a few and we\u2019ll get to clean up the mess,\u201d Scanlan muttered, darkly. </p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe!\u201d said Grog, beaming. </p><p>Pike sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s get inside and leave it to the guards,\u201d said Vex, heading up the path. More to herself, she added, \u201cPelor willing, the Hunt will follow through on their fucking jobs and find the rest of the little devils while we\u2019re all asleep.\u201d </p><hr><p>Aside from a brief pause for Percy to fill the leader of the guard in on what they\u2019d discussed, and to confirm that they were going to spend the night seeking out the invaders, the trip back to the castle was blessedly uneventful. After checking in on the kids (who were various levels of shaken, but all unharmed), filling Cassandra in, and getting themselves dinner, they all said their goodnights and headed to bed. </p><p>It was while laying in bed, staring at nothing, that the storm Vex had been fighting for hours finally threatened to break. </p><p>With the day\u2019s stress behind her, grief threatened to overwhelm. It had been waiting in the wings all day, and she hated that it had come so easily, after so long, over something so stupid\u2026She didn\u2019t want to think about that now, she didn\u2019t want to feel this, she was supposed to be <i>over it </i>after twenty blasted years! </p><p>Groaning softly, she rolled over on her side, as if the action would somehow physically force the old feelings away. It didn\u2019t, but it did give her a view of her husband, framed in the soft glow of moonlight, the top buttons on his shirt undone, staring thoughtfully out the window over the city. He had that look about him, the one that spoke of wheels turning furiously behind his eyes, thoughts flying a mile a minute. No doubt, whatever was on his mind was eons more worthwhile than anything plaguing hers. Just about anything had to be more productive than getting worked up over old wounds.</p><p>\u201cA copper for your thoughts, darling?\u201d she said, shoving her grief and a stray pillow out of the way.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI just\u2026\u201d he said, \u201cI still can\u2019t\u2014I feel like we\u2019re missing something. Something about the goblin\u2019s behavior felt\u2026off, in ways we can\u2019t explain even by saying it\u2019s probably a scout, I\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ugh. The fucking <i>goblins </i>were the last thing she wanted to think about right now.</p><p>\u201c<i>Percy,</i>\u201d she said, slipping out of bed, \u201cIt\u2019s just goblins. It\u2019s strange that it slipped past our defenses, sure, but we know it\u2019s here now, and I\u2019m sure the guards will have dealt with it by morning.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2026you\u2019re probably right, I know, but something just\u2026I can\u2019t explain it, but something just isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d </p><p>Padding on nearly silent feet, she crossed to him, pressing herself to his back and loosely wrapping his arms around him. \u201cEverything\u2019s a puzzle with you, lately,\u201d she murmured, quietly reveling in the way she could feel tension leeching out of him at her touch. \u201cWhatever strangeness there may be here doesn\u2019t really change things, does it? Unusual goblins are still goblins, there\u2019s no point in staying up all night thinking about it\u2026\u201d</p><p>Percy hummed, thoughtfully, leaning back slightly against him. </p><p>A playful grin spread across her face. Slowly, with so little pressure as to feel almost like a ghost, she traced a finger down his arm, all the way down to where his own hand still clutched the windowsill, watching a trail of goosebumps break out behind her touch. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more\u2026<i>interesting </i>ways we could spend our time, in any case,\u201d she whispered, right next to his ear. Her grin widened as she felt him shiver. \u201cMuch more worthwhile uses for that scheming mind and those clever hands.\u201d She let her fingers tangle with his. </p><p>He swallowed, hard enough for her to hear, and she had to bury her mouth against the back of his neck to hold back a laugh. Twenty years, and it was still so easy to bring that clear flush to his cheeks, <i>gods </i>she loved him so much. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Percy said, curling his hand in hers. </p><p>\u201cCome to bed, darling,\u201d she whispered, gently tugging him away from the window. Unresisting, he followed.</p><p>There\u2019d be time to worry about goblins and old wounds later. For now, they were alone, spring was upon them, and there were far, far better uses for their time.</p>",

Finding each other in a crowd, letting the other know that dinner was ready without having to search the entire castle. The most urgent use of it had been when a then-seven-year-old Crispin had wandered off during a trip to Emon, and that was nearly a decade past. </p><p>It was for this reason that Percy\u2019s initial reaction to Vex\u2019s cry was one of confusion. The look was mirrored in his friend\u2019s faces, as was the sinking dread as they all processed what she\u2019d said. He saw Scanlan\u2019s eyes take on the fierce coldness they always did whenever they\u2019d come across goblins, saw Pike look at the children with a growing look of the same fear Percy felt, saw Keyleth take in all the visitors and civilians just passing through the town square or setting up their stands. </p><p>Of all the worst possible settings for an attack\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Percy said, grasping his own earring. As if his voice had been a sign, the others sprang into action, Grog and Pike rushing to fetch their weapons from respective bags. Percy pulled Tiffany off of Trinket\u2019s back as the bear stood, and handed her off to Crispin, who\u2019d been staring with trepidation at the adults in their sudden stillness. \u201cTake your siblings and get into an inn, tell them to brace for a fight,\u201d he said. </p><p>Whitestone had learned from the Briarwoods and the Chroma Conclave. They\u2019d made plans for future attacks, the people needed only to be alerted and they would react as needed. </p><p>(Except they hadn\u2019t actually needed such strategies in decades, and those strategies had assumed that the threat would come from outside, not from the very heart of the city, and they didn\u2019t account for all these visitors, they needed more time to prepare, <i>how in the Nine Hells did goblins get into the heart of Whitestone\u2014</i>) </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one in the storeroom, I\u2019ve got it trapped!\u201d Vex\u2019s voice drew Percy out of his thoughts. Fuck it, they\u2019d have to trust that those who remembered those dark times would guide those who didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with the kids and help direct people to safety,\u201d Pike said, wrenching her mace free. Then, at the top of her lungs: \u201cEveryone get inside, hurry! Keep your kids close! Goblin attack!\u201d Crispin, who had looked ready to ask his father for a further explanation, turned white at Pike\u2019s call and nodded mutely at Percy, grabbing Arthur by the hand and hoarsely telling the other two to stay close. </p><p>Keyleth grabbed Percy\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get in the air and see if I can\u2019t keep an eye on things, maybe signal to the guards where the rest of the attack is,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Percy said, \u201cStay safe.\u201d She pulled away, her form effortlessly shifting into the familiar golden feathers of a giant eagle, and launched herself into the air. Percy looked to Grog and Scanlan and gestured for them to follow him; he didn\u2019t have any weapons on him, but they didn\u2019t know where the storeroom was, and as sure as he was that a single goblin posed no threat for Vex, even unarmed, it was never just one goblin for long. Trinket seemed to agree, the bear already rumbling past. </p><p>The storehouse wasn\u2019t far, but the journey was made difficult by people rushing past in a panic, despite the best efforts of one or two guards and the normal townsfolk to usher them to safely. Word was spreading quickly, it seemed. Trinket, focused purely on coming to Vex\u2019s rescue, cleared enough of a path just by charging past that they still arrived quickly enough. </p><p>Upon rounding the final corner, Percy spotted two guards rushing to help his wife, who was holding the door closed. Another bit of movement caught his eye, however; something small and dark was pushing itself through the small, high window on the opposite side of the storehouse from the door. </p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d he shouted, pointing. The creature turned two huge yellow eyes toward the sound and yelped, struggling even more to squeeze through. \u201cIt\u2019s climbing out the window!\u201d </p><p>Scanlan launched a blast of lightning the goblin\u2019s way just as it managed to slip out of the window, the bolt crashing by it harmlessly and striking the stone wall of the storehouse. The goblin scrambled to its feet and dashed in a headlong sprint down the alley, Grog and Scanlan both rushing in pursuit. The two guards who\u2019d run to Vex stopped by her for a moment, but her angry gesture sent them joining in the chase. </p><p>Percy grabbed Vex by the arm, trying to keep terror from turning his grip into a vice and failing entirely. \u201cAre you hurt at all?\u201d he asked, frantic. \u201cDid it attack you, are you\u2014\u201c </p><p>(He\u2019d seen the aftermath of goblin attacks. Parents devastated by watching their children dragged away screaming, houses ransacked, bodies mangled and in some cases <i>eaten, </i>he\u2019d seen what goblins could do to people who were caught unawares, and for everything he\u2019d seen with his own eyes he\u2019d heard dozens of stories about even worse deeds. In his mind he could see all of it, all the horrors and violence, superimposed over Whitestone, over the visitors, over his own children\u2014) </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fucking fantastic when we\u2019ve killed a few bloody goblins,\u201d Vex snapped, pushing some hair out of her face. Trinket pressed his head under her free hand and moaned. \u201cYes, darling, I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m okay, it never got the chance to so much as touch me. Gods dammit, how\u2019d the little bastards get this far in past our defenses?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Percy said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to investigate after we\u2019ve repelled the initial attack. Hopefully we don\u2019t have too many casualties, but with this many strangers in town\u2014the kids are safe, at least, they\u2019ve got Pike with them, but\u2014\u201c </p><p>\u201cRight, the kids,\u201d Vex said. \u201cI\u2014good, that\u2019s good. Gods, of all things to go wrong today\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should fetch Scanlan and Grog, for now, and regroup. They\u2019ve probably dealt with the one you spotted, and we need to help the town brace for the full attack.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Vex nodded. Her eyes focused and hardened. \u201cGods damn them for attacking when I\u2019ve left Fenthras at home, but we can deal with that, I can make do with any bow in a pinch.\u201d Trinket grunted his agreement.</p><p>Instead of the expected bloodbath, however, what Vex and Percy found in the intersection of two alleys was the guards scratching their heads, Grog looking disappointed, and Scanlan looking <i>livid. </i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Vex asked, looking around. </p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Grog. \u201cIt got away. Not sure where it went.\u201d </p><p>Percy stopped and stared at the goliath. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014you were outrun by a <i>goblin?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d </p><p>Trinket sniffed the air, growling softly before lumbering toward a stack of half-broken crates someone had discarded. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to imply anything bad, Grog, I just\u2014that\u2019s really surprising,\u201d Percy said, holding his hands up reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re just as fast as ever, maybe you just got unlucky.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo be fair, it was a pretty damn quick little runt,\u201d Scanlan grumbled. \u201cProbably got spooked and ran off to rejoin the rest of them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrinket, darling, don\u2019t eat that,\u201d Vex said absently, as the bear pawed at one of the crates. </p><p>Percy nodded, then turned to the two guards, who stood to attention. \u201cOrganize a search,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you send the word out, too, as you go? Tell any stragglers to get inside? Quickly, please, there\u2019s no telling how much time left we\u2019ve got.\u201d </p><p>The guards nodded, and sped off. \u201cI\u2019m sure Keyleth\u2019ll make lots of noise if she spots the main force,\u201d Vex said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care how fast this goblin is, none of them are going to outrun her when she\u2019s in the sky\u2014Trinket, I told you, there\u2019s nothing to eat in there, stop that, you\u2019re going to get a nose full of splinters.\u201d </p><p>The bear grunted, but ignored Vex, continuing to push aside some of the partly rotted wood. There was a crack in the wall behind the pile of crates, now that Percy looked. \u201cOf course he\u2019s looking for food while we\u2019re under attack,\u201d Scanlan grumbled, tail lashing. \u201cFuck, we don\u2019t even know which way the little devil went! I can\u2019t believe we lost it, the blasted\u2014\u201d</p><p>All at once, Trinket went entirely stiff, his occasional grunting replaced by a low, rumbling growl that seemed to vibrate through the very ground. </p><p>\u2026In fact, if he looked closely, the crack might just be big enough for someone very small to squeeze into, should they need to disappear from sight.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Good bear, Trinket,\u201d said Vex, slowly. All four of them changed their stances; Grog stood, a grin splitting his face at the prospect of a return the hunt. Magic swirled around Scanlan\u2019s fingertips, shimmering violet smoke beginning to form into fingers beneath him. Vex and Percy, unarmed, braced themselves. </p><p>Trinket shoved his face into the crack as hard as he could, his jaws audibly snapping, only to then pull back with a roar, a thin line of blood dripping off his muzzle as he reared up. The goblin was a blur of shadows as it took the brief opportunity to zip past, narrowly avoiding the bear\u2019s claws as he thudded back down onto the ground. Percy and Vex both lurched in an attempt to grab the goblin as it sped past, but it dodged away out of reach, narrowly darting under Grog\u2019s axe by fractions of an inch and speeding past. Scanlan sprang up on Bigby\u2019s hand, but the goblin had somehow gotten all the way past them, and was scrambling over a fence between two buildings. </p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019ll get away that easily, you\u2019re in for a <i>shock!</i>\u201d Scanlan shouted, magic crackling around his hand. Lightning slammed into where the goblin should have been, blasting a hole in the fence and setting it ablaze, but somehow, the goblin had shifted, narrowly avoiding what seemed like <i>all </i>of the damage from the strike. With a panicked yelp, it disappeared over the fence, the sound of its retreating footsteps almost inaudible over the crackling flames. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/998d385ebfadd83d8cec0b32ba5e1132/tumblr_inline_pfzpmcwrgL1r1p1hw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"></figure><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t!\u201d Scanlan shouted, soaring on Bigby\u2019s hand over the fence. With a bellow, Grog followed suit, knocking a hole in the fence with his axe rather than bothering with climbing over it. </p><p>Vex moved to chase as well, but Percy grabbed her arm. \u201cVex,\u201d he said, \u201cVex, we need to deal with things elsewhere\u2014we don\u2019t even have our weapons, there\u2019s not much we can do, leave them to it.\u201d </p><p>With a frustrated noise, Vex tugged her arm away and gestured at Trinket, who was attempting to lick at the thin scratch across the bridge of his muzzle. \u201cLook at your poor face, gods dammit\u2014let\u2019s just\u2026go help where we can, I suppose,\u201d she said. </p><p>Another blast of magic burst audibly some distance away. \u201cSounds like they\u2019ve got that one squared away without us, anyhow,\u201d Percy muttered.</p><hr><p>\u2018Nervous\u2019 was not often a word applicable to the members of the Grey Hunt, but right now, anxiety lingered on all of their faces as they silently watched Vex\u2019ahlia pace in front of them. \u00a0Percy had joined some guards to investigate the storehouse, Scanlan and Grog were still off helping in the search for the main force of the goblins, Keyleth and Pike remained as they were, and Vex was doing some investigating of her own.<br></p><p>Well, more of an <i>interrogation </i>than an investigation. Percy had his way of seeking answers, and she had hers. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, pausing, arms crossed. \u201cWould any of you would like to explain to me how this happened, exactly?\u201d </p><p>The hunters looked at each other, and one spoke up. \u201cMy lady?\u201d he said, and Vex felt cold fury rise within her at the tentative, yet genuine confusion in his voice. </p><p>\u201cThe bloody goblins!\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou all have one job, one <i>fucking </i>job\u2014to keep watch over the damned Patchwood. There should have been no way that we find out about goblins only when one breaks into a storeroom in the heart of the fucking city!\u201d Several of the hunters cringed at the outburst. Was the guilt she saw sincere or imagined? Who cared, who cared, they <i>should</i> feel guilty\u2014\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I hear any reports about goblin clan movements in the area? We should have heard about this before they reached the fucking farmlands, nevermind the center of town!\u201d <i>It never should have gotten the chance to fool me into\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cLady Vex\u2019ahlia,\u201d said one of the hunters, holding out her hand. She was the only one who\u2019d been around longer than Vex at this point, actually; she\u2019d been a hunter even before the Briarwoods had come, and had helped her greatly with settling into the position of Grand Mistress. \u201cMy Lady, I understand that you\u2019re worried\u2014we all are, and with fair reason. However, I assure you, no one here would dare slack off under your watch. You\u2019ve trained this lot well. If there were no reports of goblins in the area, it\u2019s because none were observed, and we have observed the Patchwood as carefully as ever.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere was a weird burst of magic a couple weeks ago, but all we found when we checked was a bunch of angry bluecoats,\u201d one of the youngest hunters mumbled. </p><p>\u201cAye, and that a fair distance from the city,\u201d said the eldest of the hunters. Vex huffed, but took a deep breath. This was true\u2014she\u2019d remembered that report; she\u2019d not been part of the team that investigated, but she knew that it had been handled carefully and turned out to be nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t know how these goblins got in, but we will find out how they slipped past us,\u201d she continued. </p><p>\u201cSee to it that you do,\u201d Vex said, dismissing them with a frustrated wave of her hand. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even find a bunch of bloody <i>goblins, </i>then we\u2019ve got a real problem on our hands.\u201d </p><p>As the Hunt dispersed, Vex pinched the bridge of her nose. Bloody <i>goblins, </i>of all things to have to deal with\u2014</p><p>Trinket nudged her arm and moaned softly. Absently, she patted the top of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, buddy,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s only goblins. Nothing we can\u2019t handle. Just have to find the bloody things\u2026\u201d </p><p>Shaking herself, she moved towards the tavern Pike had taken the kids to; they\u2019d agreed over the earrings to meet up here again to compare notes in about ten minutes. Not that she\u2019d have much to offer, just the word of a toddler and the news that the Hunt had apparently missed an entire tribe of goblins. Gods. </p><p>What a nightmare. </p><p>The others trickled toward the rendezvous point slowly, Pike coming first after Cassandra stopped by to pick up the kids and usher them all towards the castle. Percy joined them next, looking very thoughtful; Keyleth swooped down and landed next, her own face worried. </p><p>\u201cDid you catch sight of them?\u201d Percy asked her. </p><p>Keyleth shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s the weird thing,\u201d she started, \u201cI only\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud, gruff stream of swearing cut her off, as Grog stomped up, Scanlan looking irritable at his side. </p><p>\u201cLittle fuck got away again!\u201d Grog griped, swinging his axe up to rest on one shoulder. \u201cI nearly \u2018ad it one second, and the next, it was just gone!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt ran between your legs while you were busy overswinging,\u201d Scanlan scowled. \u201cAnd <i>then </i>it disappeared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even get the first goblin?\u201d Pike asked, genuinely confused. Percy paused in whatever thoughts had him distracted long enough to fill Pike in on what she\u2019d missed whilst guarding the kids.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfd71aa82e14435ee6477e0296afe52f/tumblr_inline_pfzpn9mJxB1r1p1hw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"></figure><p>\u201cIt was really fast, Pike!\u201d Grog whined. </p><p>\u201cAnd very strange,\u201d said Percy. \u201cThe storehouse was full of all kinds of food, albeit not as much as there was before winter, but there was plenty of dried meats, and none of it very well hidden. Yet as far as I can tell, this goblin was evidently only interested in a bunch of herbs, for some reason. The bags they\u2019d been stored in had been ripped open, and there were scraps of them everywhere.\u201d </p><p>Scanlan gestured questioningly at Percy. \u201cSo it made a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a goblin. They do that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but what use do goblins have for cooking herbs?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re getting tired of only putting salt and pepper on their grandma stew.\u201d <br><br>\n\u201cScanlan!\u201d Pike hissed. </p><p>Vex was barely processing most of the conversation, staring off into the distance and letting the words fly around her. The first goblin\u2019s escape grated on her nerves. The thought of the little impost\u2014<i>intruder </i>getting away untouched burned her. Sweet Sarenrae, it was one bloody goblin, surely they could at least track it to wherever the rest were hiding? They\u2019d all brought down a would-be god, but <i>goblins </i>were giving them this much trouble?</p><p>\u201cWell, Kiki, you can still point us toward the rest, right?\u201d Grog\u2019s hopeful voice brought her marginally back to the present. No doubt he was looking forward to the chance to fight something. For once, Vex found herself in similar shoes. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was saying when you guys got here,\u201d Keyleth said. \u201cI scanned the whole city as best I could several times, but I only ever saw the one goblin. I don\u2019t know if there <i>are </i>any others here.\u201d </p><p>Scanlan rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never just one goblin, there\u2019s got to be others!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t see any,\u201d said Keyleth, leaning forward with a worried stare. </p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get distracted by anything?\u201d Vex said. \u201cNothing caught in your eye?\u201d</p><p>Keyleth looked hurt. \u201cI was\u2014I tried to be really thorough, and I\u2019m telling you, there was only one goblin!\u201d </p><p>Vex sighed. She\u2019d really meant to keep the scorn out of her voice, there. Keyleth didn\u2019t deserve it, she was just\u2014angry. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you were, I\u2019m sorry, darling. I\u2019m just\u2026stressed out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you at least see which way the first one went?\u201d Scanlan asked. </p><p>Keyleth shifted and shook her head. \u201cI was searching a different part of the city when you two lost track of it, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, guys.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sakes,\u201d Grog growled, letting the head of his axe thump down. </p><p>Scanlan scoffed. \u201cDidn\u2019t see where the first one went, didn\u2019t see the others, maybe you were distracted! Were you paying attention at all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cScanlan,\u201d Percy said, a warning in his voice. </p><p>\u201cGuys, hey, don\u2019t do this now,\u201d Pike cautioned. </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Keyleth snapped. \u201cI didn\u2019t fly up to just fuck around, guys, I was really searching hard! There was only one goblin, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d said Keyleth. </p><p>\u201cIt must have been a scout, then,\u201d Vex said, rolling her eyes. \u201cRight? It was very quick, and, Scanlan, you said before that it was a small one?\u201d </p><p>Scanlan shrugged. \u201cHard to tell under the cloak, but it seemed like it was on the small side for a goblin, yeah.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we found it where we keep the food. There you are, then, it must\u2019ve been a scout,\u201d Vex continued. \u201cIt was sent in ahead of the main force to find out where we keep everything, since it\u2019s quick and good at disappearing, evidently. Explains everything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlmost everything,\u201d said Percy. \u201cExcept for the herbs, which I still don\u2019t get\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes it really matter why it was digging around through something weird?\u201d Scanlan groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s a goblin, Percy, who knows what it was thinking.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026I suppose it probably doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said, still looking thoughtful. He shook his head. \u201cWell, if this was a scout, then the main attack is yet to happen. We\u2019ll have to ask everyone to do a head count on their families, check that their kids are safe, and brace to be hit at a later date\u2026Probably tomorrow, now that I think about it. During a festival would be the time to attack. Although\u2026whether or not the goblins actually know that we\u2019re having a festival is another question entirely, but\u2026regardless, we\u2019d all best make sure we\u2019re rested up tonight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe guards will probably have tracked the goblins down by next morning,\u201d Vex said, waving her hand irritably. </p><p>\u201cRight, but if they don\u2019t,\u201d said Percy, \u201cWe\u2019ll all want to make sure we\u2019re at the top of our game. Anyone who can fight will need to be ready to defend those who can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not\u2026we\u2019re not going through with the festival with goblins nearby, are we?\u201d said Keyleth. </p><p>Percy sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking with the captain of the guard, and the guards have all been checking in with the townsfolk. A lot of the visitors are scared, but most of the residents are all of the opinion that they\u2019re not about to take this without a fight. They\u2019re determined to celebrate, whether we in charge like it or not, and plenty of people have already volunteered to act as a militia to help bolster defenses.\u201d He shot Keyleth a tired grin. \u201cSome of those old enough to remember the Briarwoods have been especially vocal about not hiding away from a threat, and I can\u2019t find it in me to tell them they\u2019re wrong.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cWe\u2019ll\u2026just have to do the best we can, and hope they do track down and destroy the main force before it strikes.\u201d </p><p>Keyleth bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d she murmured. </p><p>\u201cHas anyone been reported missing?\u201d Pike said. \u201cThat\u2019s my first worry, that maybe these ones are sneaky enough to take people quietly, since they\u2019ve avoided detection so far.\u201d </p><p>Percy shook his head. \u201cNot everyone\u2019s done a head count, mind you, but so far everyone seems to be accounted for.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey better fuckin\u2019 attack tomorrow,\u201d Grog grumbled. \u201cGot all worked up for a fight and then the fuckin\u2019 goblin got away.\u201d </p><p>Pike patted his knee. \u201cAw, buddy,\u201d she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll find you somebody to spar with, I promise.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Grog complained. \u201cI was hopin\u2019 for a proper fight and some killing and everything, and the stupid slippery little goblin got away!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we can\u2019t do any killing, but you and me can go visit Vasselheim soon, maybe, go defend our titles?\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026I guess,\u201d Grog said, scuffing the ground. </p><p>\u201cWho knows, maybe the guards\u2019ll miss a few and we\u2019ll get to clean up the mess,\u201d Scanlan muttered, darkly. </p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe!\u201d said Grog, beaming. </p><p>Pike sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s get inside and leave it to the guards,\u201d said Vex, heading up the path. More to herself, she added, \u201cPelor willing, the Hunt will follow through on their fucking jobs and find the rest of the little devils while we\u2019re all asleep.\u201d </p><hr><p>Aside from a brief pause for Percy to fill the leader of the guard in on what they\u2019d discussed, and to confirm that they were going to spend the night seeking out the invaders, the trip back to the castle was blessedly uneventful. After checking in on the kids (who were various levels of shaken, but all unharmed), filling Cassandra in, and getting themselves dinner, they all said their goodnights and headed to bed. </p><p>It was while laying in bed, staring at nothing, that the storm Vex had been fighting for hours finally threatened to break. </p><p>With the day\u2019s stress behind her, grief threatened to overwhelm. It had been waiting in the wings all day, and she hated that it had come so easily, after so long, over something so stupid\u2026She didn\u2019t want to think about that now, she didn\u2019t want to feel this, she was supposed to be <i>over it </i>after twenty blasted years! </p><p>Groaning softly, she rolled over on her side, as if the action would somehow physically force the old feelings away. It didn\u2019t, but it did give her a view of her husband, framed in the soft glow of moonlight, the top buttons on his shirt undone, staring thoughtfully out the window over the city. He had that look about him, the one that spoke of wheels turning furiously behind his eyes, thoughts flying a mile a minute. No doubt, whatever was on his mind was eons more worthwhile than anything plaguing hers. Just about anything had to be more productive than getting worked up over old wounds.</p><p>\u201cA copper for your thoughts, darling?\u201d she said, shoving her grief and a stray pillow out of the way.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI just\u2026\u201d he said, \u201cI still can\u2019t\u2014I feel like we\u2019re missing something. Something about the goblin\u2019s behavior felt\u2026off, in ways we can\u2019t explain even by saying it\u2019s probably a scout, I\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ugh. The fucking <i>goblins </i>were the last thing she wanted to think about right now.</p><p>\u201c<i>Percy,</i>\u201d she said, slipping out of bed, \u201cIt\u2019s just goblins. It\u2019s strange that it slipped past our defenses, sure, but we know it\u2019s here now, and I\u2019m sure the guards will have dealt with it by morning.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2026you\u2019re probably right, I know, but something just\u2026I can\u2019t explain it, but something just isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d </p><p>Padding on nearly silent feet, she crossed to him, pressing herself to his back and loosely wrapping his arms around him. \u201cEverything\u2019s a puzzle with you, lately,\u201d she murmured, quietly reveling in the way she could feel tension leeching out of him at her touch. \u201cWhatever strangeness there may be here doesn\u2019t really change things, does it? Unusual goblins are still goblins, there\u2019s no point in staying up all night thinking about it\u2026\u201d</p><p>Percy hummed, thoughtfully, leaning back slightly against him. </p><p>A playful grin spread across her face. Slowly, with so little pressure as to feel almost like a ghost, she traced a finger down his arm, all the way down to where his own hand still clutched the windowsill, watching a trail of goosebumps break out behind her touch. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more\u2026<i>interesting </i>ways we could spend our time, in any case,\u201d she whispered, right next to his ear. Her grin widened as she felt him shiver. \u201cMuch more worthwhile uses for that scheming mind and those clever hands.\u201d She let her fingers tangle with his. </p><p>He swallowed, hard enough for her to hear, and she had to bury her mouth against the back of his neck to hold back a laugh. Twenty years, and it was still so easy to bring that clear flush to his cheeks, <i>gods </i>she loved him so much. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Percy said, curling his hand in hers. </p><p>\u201cCome to bed, darling,\u201d she whispered, gently tugging him away from the window. Unresisting, he followed.</p><p>There\u2019d be time to worry about goblins and old wounds later. For now, they were alone, spring was upon them, and there were far, far better uses for their time.</p></p>",

Finding each other in a crowd, letting the other know that dinner was ready without having to search the entire castle. The most urgent use of it had been when a then-seven-year-old Crispin had wandered off during a trip to Emon, and that was nearly a decade past. </p><p>It was for this reason that Percy\u2019s initial reaction to Vex\u2019s cry was one of confusion. The look was mirrored in his friend\u2019s faces, as was the sinking dread as they all processed what she\u2019d said. He saw Scanlan\u2019s eyes take on the fierce coldness they always did whenever they\u2019d come across goblins, saw Pike look at the children with a growing look of the same fear Percy felt, saw Keyleth take in all the visitors and civilians just passing through the town square or setting up their stands. </p><p>Of all the worst possible settings for an attack\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Percy said, grasping his own earring. As if his voice had been a sign, the others sprang into action, Grog and Pike rushing to fetch their weapons from respective bags. Percy pulled Tiffany off of Trinket\u2019s back as the bear stood, and handed her off to Crispin, who\u2019d been staring with trepidation at the adults in their sudden stillness. \u201cTake your siblings and get into an inn, tell them to brace for a fight,\u201d he said. </p><p>Whitestone had learned from the Briarwoods and the Chroma Conclave. They\u2019d made plans for future attacks, the people needed only to be alerted and they would react as needed. </p><p>(Except they hadn\u2019t actually needed such strategies in decades, and those strategies had assumed that the threat would come from outside, not from the very heart of the city, and they didn\u2019t account for all these visitors, they needed more time to prepare, <i>how in the Nine Hells did goblins get into the heart of Whitestone\u2014</i>) </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one in the storeroom, I\u2019ve got it trapped!\u201d Vex\u2019s voice drew Percy out of his thoughts. Fuck it, they\u2019d have to trust that those who remembered those dark times would guide those who didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with the kids and help direct people to safety,\u201d Pike said, wrenching her mace free. Then, at the top of her lungs: \u201cEveryone get inside, hurry! Keep your kids close! Goblin attack!\u201d Crispin, who had looked ready to ask his father for a further explanation, turned white at Pike\u2019s call and nodded mutely at Percy, grabbing Arthur by the hand and hoarsely telling the other two to stay close. </p><p>Keyleth grabbed Percy\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get in the air and see if I can\u2019t keep an eye on things, maybe signal to the guards where the rest of the attack is,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Percy said, \u201cStay safe.\u201d She pulled away, her form effortlessly shifting into the familiar golden feathers of a giant eagle, and launched herself into the air. Percy looked to Grog and Scanlan and gestured for them to follow him; he didn\u2019t have any weapons on him, but they didn\u2019t know where the storeroom was, and as sure as he was that a single goblin posed no threat for Vex, even unarmed, it was never just one goblin for long. Trinket seemed to agree, the bear already rumbling past. </p><p>The storehouse wasn\u2019t far, but the journey was made difficult by people rushing past in a panic, despite the best efforts of one or two guards and the normal townsfolk to usher them to safely. Word was spreading quickly, it seemed. Trinket, focused purely on coming to Vex\u2019s rescue, cleared enough of a path just by charging past that they still arrived quickly enough. </p><p>Upon rounding the final corner, Percy spotted two guards rushing to help his wife, who was holding the door closed. Another bit of movement caught his eye, however; something small and dark was pushing itself through the small, high window on the opposite side of the storehouse from the door. </p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d he shouted, pointing. The creature turned two huge yellow eyes toward the sound and yelped, struggling even more to squeeze through. \u201cIt\u2019s climbing out the window!\u201d </p><p>Scanlan launched a blast of lightning the goblin\u2019s way just as it managed to slip out of the window, the bolt crashing by it harmlessly and striking the stone wall of the storehouse. The goblin scrambled to its feet and dashed in a headlong sprint down the alley, Grog and Scanlan both rushing in pursuit. The two guards who\u2019d run to Vex stopped by her for a moment, but her angry gesture sent them joining in the chase. </p><p>Percy grabbed Vex by the arm, trying to keep terror from turning his grip into a vice and failing entirely. \u201cAre you hurt at all?\u201d he asked, frantic. \u201cDid it attack you, are you\u2014\u201c </p><p>(He\u2019d seen the aftermath of goblin attacks. Parents devastated by watching their children dragged away screaming, houses ransacked, bodies mangled and in some cases <i>eaten, </i>he\u2019d seen what goblins could do to people who were caught unawares, and for everything he\u2019d seen with his own eyes he\u2019d heard dozens of stories about even worse deeds. In his mind he could see all of it, all the horrors and violence, superimposed over Whitestone, over the visitors, over his own children\u2014) </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fucking fantastic when we\u2019ve killed a few bloody goblins,\u201d Vex snapped, pushing some hair out of her face. Trinket pressed his head under her free hand and moaned. \u201cYes, darling, I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m okay, it never got the chance to so much as touch me. Gods dammit, how\u2019d the little bastards get this far in past our defenses?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Percy said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to investigate after we\u2019ve repelled the initial attack. Hopefully we don\u2019t have too many casualties, but with this many strangers in town\u2014the kids are safe, at least, they\u2019ve got Pike with them, but\u2014\u201c </p><p>\u201cRight, the kids,\u201d Vex said. \u201cI\u2014good, that\u2019s good. Gods, of all things to go wrong today\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should fetch Scanlan and Grog, for now, and regroup. They\u2019ve probably dealt with the one you spotted, and we need to help the town brace for the full attack.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Vex nodded. Her eyes focused and hardened. \u201cGods damn them for attacking when I\u2019ve left Fenthras at home, but we can deal with that, I can make do with any bow in a pinch.\u201d Trinket grunted his agreement.</p><p>Instead of the expected bloodbath, however, what Vex and Percy found in the intersection of two alleys was the guards scratching their heads, Grog looking disappointed, and Scanlan looking <i>livid. </i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Vex asked, looking around. </p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Grog. \u201cIt got away. Not sure where it went.\u201d </p><p>Percy stopped and stared at the goliath. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014you were outrun by a <i>goblin?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d </p><p>Trinket sniffed the air, growling softly before lumbering toward a stack of half-broken crates someone had discarded. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to imply anything bad, Grog, I just\u2014that\u2019s really surprising,\u201d Percy said, holding his hands up reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re just as fast as ever, maybe you just got unlucky.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo be fair, it was a pretty damn quick little runt,\u201d Scanlan grumbled. \u201cProbably got spooked and ran off to rejoin the rest of them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrinket, darling, don\u2019t eat that,\u201d Vex said absently, as the bear pawed at one of the crates. </p><p>Percy nodded, then turned to the two guards, who stood to attention. \u201cOrganize a search,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you send the word out, too, as you go? Tell any stragglers to get inside? Quickly, please, there\u2019s no telling how much time left we\u2019ve got.\u201d </p><p>The guards nodded, and sped off. \u201cI\u2019m sure Keyleth\u2019ll make lots of noise if she spots the main force,\u201d Vex said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care how fast this goblin is, none of them are going to outrun her when she\u2019s in the sky\u2014Trinket, I told you, there\u2019s nothing to eat in there, stop that, you\u2019re going to get a nose full of splinters.\u201d </p><p>The bear grunted, but ignored Vex, continuing to push aside some of the partly rotted wood. There was a crack in the wall behind the pile of crates, now that Percy looked. \u201cOf course he\u2019s looking for food while we\u2019re under attack,\u201d Scanlan grumbled, tail lashing. \u201cFuck, we don\u2019t even know which way the little devil went! I can\u2019t believe we lost it, the blasted\u2014\u201d</p><p>All at once, Trinket went entirely stiff, his occasional grunting replaced by a low, rumbling growl that seemed to vibrate through the very ground. </p><p>\u2026In fact, if he looked closely, the crack might just be big enough for someone very small to squeeze into, should they need to disappear from sight.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Good bear, Trinket,\u201d said Vex, slowly. All four of them changed their stances; Grog stood, a grin splitting his face at the prospect of a return the hunt. Magic swirled around Scanlan\u2019s fingertips, shimmering violet smoke beginning to form into fingers beneath him. Vex and Percy, unarmed, braced themselves. </p><p>Trinket shoved his face into the crack as hard as he could, his jaws audibly snapping, only to then pull back with a roar, a thin line of blood dripping off his muzzle as he reared up. The goblin was a blur of shadows as it took the brief opportunity to zip past, narrowly avoiding the bear\u2019s claws as he thudded back down onto the ground. Percy and Vex both lurched in an attempt to grab the goblin as it sped past, but it dodged away out of reach, narrowly darting under Grog\u2019s axe by fractions of an inch and speeding past. Scanlan sprang up on Bigby\u2019s hand, but the goblin had somehow gotten all the way past them, and was scrambling over a fence between two buildings. </p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019ll get away that easily, you\u2019re in for a <i>shock!</i>\u201d Scanlan shouted, magic crackling around his hand. Lightning slammed into where the goblin should have been, blasting a hole in the fence and setting it ablaze, but somehow, the goblin had shifted, narrowly avoiding what seemed like <i>all </i>of the damage from the strike. With a panicked yelp, it disappeared over the fence, the sound of its retreating footsteps almost inaudible over the crackling flames. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/998d385ebfadd83d8cec0b32ba5e1132/tumblr_inline_pfzpmcwrgL1r1p1hw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"></figure><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t!\u201d Scanlan shouted, soaring on Bigby\u2019s hand over the fence. With a bellow, Grog followed suit, knocking a hole in the fence with his axe rather than bothering with climbing over it. </p><p>Vex moved to chase as well, but Percy grabbed her arm. \u201cVex,\u201d he said, \u201cVex, we need to deal with things elsewhere\u2014we don\u2019t even have our weapons, there\u2019s not much we can do, leave them to it.\u201d </p><p>With a frustrated noise, Vex tugged her arm away and gestured at Trinket, who was attempting to lick at the thin scratch across the bridge of his muzzle. \u201cLook at your poor face, gods dammit\u2014let\u2019s just\u2026go help where we can, I suppose,\u201d she said. </p><p>Another blast of magic burst audibly some distance away. \u201cSounds like they\u2019ve got that one squared away without us, anyhow,\u201d Percy muttered.</p><hr><p>\u2018Nervous\u2019 was not often a word applicable to the members of the Grey Hunt, but right now, anxiety lingered on all of their faces as they silently watched Vex\u2019ahlia pace in front of them. \u00a0Percy had joined some guards to investigate the storehouse, Scanlan and Grog were still off helping in the search for the main force of the goblins, Keyleth and Pike remained as they were, and Vex was doing some investigating of her own.<br></p><p>Well, more of an <i>interrogation </i>than an investigation. Percy had his way of seeking answers, and she had hers. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, pausing, arms crossed. \u201cWould any of you would like to explain to me how this happened, exactly?\u201d </p><p>The hunters looked at each other, and one spoke up. \u201cMy lady?\u201d he said, and Vex felt cold fury rise within her at the tentative, yet genuine confusion in his voice. </p><p>\u201cThe bloody goblins!\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou all have one job, one <i>fucking </i>job\u2014to keep watch over the damned Patchwood. There should have been no way that we find out about goblins only when one breaks into a storeroom in the heart of the fucking city!\u201d Several of the hunters cringed at the outburst. Was the guilt she saw sincere or imagined? Who cared, who cared, they <i>should</i> feel guilty\u2014\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I hear any reports about goblin clan movements in the area? We should have heard about this before they reached the fucking farmlands, nevermind the center of town!\u201d <i>It never should have gotten the chance to fool me into\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cLady Vex\u2019ahlia,\u201d said one of the hunters, holding out her hand. She was the only one who\u2019d been around longer than Vex at this point, actually; she\u2019d been a hunter even before the Briarwoods had come, and had helped her greatly with settling into the position of Grand Mistress. \u201cMy Lady, I understand that you\u2019re worried\u2014we all are, and with fair reason. However, I assure you, no one here would dare slack off under your watch. You\u2019ve trained this lot well. If there were no reports of goblins in the area, it\u2019s because none were observed, and we have observed the Patchwood as carefully as ever.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere was a weird burst of magic a couple weeks ago, but all we found when we checked was a bunch of angry bluecoats,\u201d one of the youngest hunters mumbled. </p><p>\u201cAye, and that a fair distance from the city,\u201d said the eldest of the hunters. Vex huffed, but took a deep breath. This was true\u2014she\u2019d remembered that report; she\u2019d not been part of the team that investigated, but she knew that it had been handled carefully and turned out to be nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t know how these goblins got in, but we will find out how they slipped past us,\u201d she continued. </p><p>\u201cSee to it that you do,\u201d Vex said, dismissing them with a frustrated wave of her hand. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even find a bunch of bloody <i>goblins, </i>then we\u2019ve got a real problem on our hands.\u201d </p><p>As the Hunt dispersed, Vex pinched the bridge of her nose. Bloody <i>goblins, </i>of all things to have to deal with\u2014</p><p>Trinket nudged her arm and moaned softly. Absently, she patted the top of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, buddy,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s only goblins. Nothing we can\u2019t handle. Just have to find the bloody things\u2026\u201d </p><p>Shaking herself, she moved towards the tavern Pike had taken the kids to; they\u2019d agreed over the earrings to meet up here again to compare notes in about ten minutes. Not that she\u2019d have much to offer, just the word of a toddler and the news that the Hunt had apparently missed an entire tribe of goblins. Gods. </p><p>What a nightmare. </p><p>The others trickled toward the rendezvous point slowly, Pike coming first after Cassandra stopped by to pick up the kids and usher them all towards the castle. Percy joined them next, looking very thoughtful; Keyleth swooped down and landed next, her own face worried. </p><p>\u201cDid you catch sight of them?\u201d Percy asked her. </p><p>Keyleth shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s the weird thing,\u201d she started, \u201cI only\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud, gruff stream of swearing cut her off, as Grog stomped up, Scanlan looking irritable at his side. </p><p>\u201cLittle fuck got away again!\u201d Grog griped, swinging his axe up to rest on one shoulder. \u201cI nearly \u2018ad it one second, and the next, it was just gone!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt ran between your legs while you were busy overswinging,\u201d Scanlan scowled. \u201cAnd <i>then </i>it disappeared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even get the first goblin?\u201d Pike asked, genuinely confused. Percy paused in whatever thoughts had him distracted long enough to fill Pike in on what she\u2019d missed whilst guarding the kids.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfd71aa82e14435ee6477e0296afe52f/tumblr_inline_pfzpn9mJxB1r1p1hw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1400\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"></figure><p>\u201cIt was really fast, Pike!\u201d Grog whined. </p><p>\u201cAnd very strange,\u201d said Percy. \u201cThe storehouse was full of all kinds of food, albeit not as much as there was before winter, but there was plenty of dried meats, and none of it very well hidden. Yet as far as I can tell, this goblin was evidently only interested in a bunch of herbs, for some reason. The bags they\u2019d been stored in had been ripped open, and there were scraps of them everywhere.\u201d </p><p>Scanlan gestured questioningly at Percy. \u201cSo it made a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a goblin. They do that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but what use do goblins have for cooking herbs?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re getting tired of only putting salt and pepper on their grandma stew.\u201d <br><br>\n\u201cScanlan!\u201d Pike hissed. </p><p>Vex was barely processing most of the conversation, staring off into the distance and letting the words fly around her. The first goblin\u2019s escape grated on her nerves. The thought of the little impost\u2014<i>intruder </i>getting away untouched burned her. Sweet Sarenrae, it was one bloody goblin, surely they could at least track it to wherever the rest were hiding? They\u2019d all brought down a would-be god, but <i>goblins </i>were giving them this much trouble?</p><p>\u201cWell, Kiki, you can still point us toward the rest, right?\u201d Grog\u2019s hopeful voice brought her marginally back to the present. No doubt he was looking forward to the chance to fight something. For once, Vex found herself in similar shoes. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was saying when you guys got here,\u201d Keyleth said. \u201cI scanned the whole city as best I could several times, but I only ever saw the one goblin. I don\u2019t know if there <i>are </i>any others here.\u201d </p><p>Scanlan rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never just one goblin, there\u2019s got to be others!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t see any,\u201d said Keyleth, leaning forward with a worried stare. </p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get distracted by anything?\u201d Vex said. \u201cNothing caught in your eye?\u201d</p><p>Keyleth looked hurt. \u201cI was\u2014I tried to be really thorough, and I\u2019m telling you, there was only one goblin!\u201d </p><p>Vex sighed. She\u2019d really meant to keep the scorn out of her voice, there. Keyleth didn\u2019t deserve it, she was just\u2014angry. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you were, I\u2019m sorry, darling. I\u2019m just\u2026stressed out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you at least see which way the first one went?\u201d Scanlan asked. </p><p>Keyleth shifted and shook her head. \u201cI was searching a different part of the city when you two lost track of it, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, guys.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sakes,\u201d Grog growled, letting the head of his axe thump down. </p><p>Scanlan scoffed. \u201cDidn\u2019t see where the first one went, didn\u2019t see the others, maybe you were distracted! Were you paying attention at all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cScanlan,\u201d Percy said, a warning in his voice. </p><p>\u201cGuys, hey, don\u2019t do this now,\u201d Pike cautioned. </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Keyleth snapped. \u201cI didn\u2019t fly up to just fuck around, guys, I was really searching hard! There was only one goblin, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d said Keyleth. </p><p>\u201cIt must have been a scout, then,\u201d Vex said, rolling her eyes. \u201cRight? It was very quick, and, Scanlan, you said before that it was a small one?\u201d </p><p>Scanlan shrugged. \u201cHard to tell under the cloak, but it seemed like it was on the small side for a goblin, yeah.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we found it where we keep the food. There you are, then, it must\u2019ve been a scout,\u201d Vex continued. \u201cIt was sent in ahead of the main force to find out where we keep everything, since it\u2019s quick and good at disappearing, evidently. Explains everything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlmost everything,\u201d said Percy. \u201cExcept for the herbs, which I still don\u2019t get\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes it really matter why it was digging around through something weird?\u201d Scanlan groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s a goblin, Percy, who knows what it was thinking.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026I suppose it probably doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said, still looking thoughtful. He shook his head. \u201cWell, if this was a scout, then the main attack is yet to happen. We\u2019ll have to ask everyone to do a head count on their families, check that their kids are safe, and brace to be hit at a later date\u2026Probably tomorrow, now that I think about it. During a festival would be the time to attack. Although\u2026whether or not the goblins actually know that we\u2019re having a festival is another question entirely, but\u2026regardless, we\u2019d all best make sure we\u2019re rested up tonight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe guards will probably have tracked the goblins down by next morning,\u201d Vex said, waving her hand irritably. </p><p>\u201cRight, but if they don\u2019t,\u201d said Percy, \u201cWe\u2019ll all want to make sure we\u2019re at the top of our game. Anyone who can fight will need to be ready to defend those who can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not\u2026we\u2019re not going through with the festival with goblins nearby, are we?\u201d said Keyleth. </p><p>Percy sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking with the captain of the guard, and the guards have all been checking in with the townsfolk. A lot of the visitors are scared, but most of the residents are all of the opinion that they\u2019re not about to take this without a fight. They\u2019re determined to celebrate, whether we in charge like it or not, and plenty of people have already volunteered to act as a militia to help bolster defenses.\u201d He shot Keyleth a tired grin. \u201cSome of those old enough to remember the Briarwoods have been especially vocal about not hiding away from a threat, and I can\u2019t find it in me to tell them they\u2019re wrong.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cWe\u2019ll\u2026just have to do the best we can, and hope they do track down and destroy the main force before it strikes.\u201d </p><p>Keyleth bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d she murmured. </p><p>\u201cHas anyone been reported missing?\u201d Pike said. \u201cThat\u2019s my first worry, that maybe these ones are sneaky enough to take people quietly, since they\u2019ve avoided detection so far.\u201d </p><p>Percy shook his head. \u201cNot everyone\u2019s done a head count, mind you, but so far everyone seems to be accounted for.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey better fuckin\u2019 attack tomorrow,\u201d Grog grumbled. \u201cGot all worked up for a fight and then the fuckin\u2019 goblin got away.\u201d </p><p>Pike patted his knee. \u201cAw, buddy,\u201d she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll find you somebody to spar with, I promise.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Grog complained. \u201cI was hopin\u2019 for a proper fight and some killing and everything, and the stupid slippery little goblin got away!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we can\u2019t do any killing, but you and me can go visit Vasselheim soon, maybe, go defend our titles?\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026I guess,\u201d Grog said, scuffing the ground. </p><p>\u201cWho knows, maybe the guards\u2019ll miss a few and we\u2019ll get to clean up the mess,\u201d Scanlan muttered, darkly. </p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe!\u201d said Grog, beaming. </p><p>Pike sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s get inside and leave it to the guards,\u201d said Vex, heading up the path. More to herself, she added, \u201cPelor willing, the Hunt will follow through on their fucking jobs and find the rest of the little devils while we\u2019re all asleep.\u201d </p><hr><p>Aside from a brief pause for Percy to fill the leader of the guard in on what they\u2019d discussed, and to confirm that they were going to spend the night seeking out the invaders, the trip back to the castle was blessedly uneventful. After checking in on the kids (who were various levels of shaken, but all unharmed), filling Cassandra in, and getting themselves dinner, they all said their goodnights and headed to bed. </p><p>It was while laying in bed, staring at nothing, that the storm Vex had been fighting for hours finally threatened to break. </p><p>With the day\u2019s stress behind her, grief threatened to overwhelm. It had been waiting in the wings all day, and she hated that it had come so easily, after so long, over something so stupid\u2026She didn\u2019t want to think about that now, she didn\u2019t want to feel this, she was supposed to be <i>over it </i>after twenty blasted years! </p><p>Groaning softly, she rolled over on her side, as if the action would somehow physically force the old feelings away. It didn\u2019t, but it did give her a view of her husband, framed in the soft glow of moonlight, the top buttons on his shirt undone, staring thoughtfully out the window over the city. He had that look about him, the one that spoke of wheels turning furiously behind his eyes, thoughts flying a mile a minute. No doubt, whatever was on his mind was eons more worthwhile than anything plaguing hers. Just about anything had to be more productive than getting worked up over old wounds.</p><p>\u201cA copper for your thoughts, darling?\u201d she said, shoving her grief and a stray pillow out of the way.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI just\u2026\u201d he said, \u201cI still can\u2019t\u2014I feel like we\u2019re missing something. Something about the goblin\u2019s behavior felt\u2026off, in ways we can\u2019t explain even by saying it\u2019s probably a scout, I\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ugh. The fucking <i>goblins </i>were the last thing she wanted to think about right now.</p><p>\u201c<i>Percy,</i>\u201d she said, slipping out of bed, \u201cIt\u2019s just goblins. It\u2019s strange that it slipped past our defenses, sure, but we know it\u2019s here now, and I\u2019m sure the guards will have dealt with it by morning.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2026you\u2019re probably right, I know, but something just\u2026I can\u2019t explain it, but something just isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d </p><p>Padding on nearly silent feet, she crossed to him, pressing herself to his back and loosely wrapping his arms around him. \u201cEverything\u2019s a puzzle with you, lately,\u201d she murmured, quietly reveling in the way she could feel tension leeching out of him at her touch. \u201cWhatever strangeness there may be here doesn\u2019t really change things, does it? Unusual goblins are still goblins, there\u2019s no point in staying up all night thinking about it\u2026\u201d</p><p>Percy hummed, thoughtfully, leaning back slightly against him. </p><p>A playful grin spread across her face. Slowly, with so little pressure as to feel almost like a ghost, she traced a finger down his arm, all the way down to where his own hand still clutched the windowsill, watching a trail of goosebumps break out behind her touch. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more\u2026<i>interesting </i>ways we could spend our time, in any case,\u201d she whispered, right next to his ear. Her grin widened as she felt him shiver. \u201cMuch more worthwhile uses for that scheming mind and those clever hands.\u201d She let her fingers tangle with his. </p><p>He swallowed, hard enough for her to hear, and she had to bury her mouth against the back of his neck to hold back a laugh. Twenty years, and it was still so easy to bring that clear flush to his cheeks, <i>gods </i>she loved him so much. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Percy said, curling his hand in hers. </p><p>\u201cCome to bed, darling,\u201d she whispered, gently tugging him away from the window. Unresisting, he followed.</p><p>There\u2019d be time to worry about goblins and old wounds later. For now, they were alone, spring was upon them, and there were far, far better uses for their time.</p></p>",

Finding each other in a crowd, letting the other know that dinner was ready without having to search the entire castle. The most urgent use of it had been when a then-seven-year-old Crispin had wandered off during a trip to Emon, and that was nearly a decade past. </p><p>It was for this reason that Percy&rsquo;s initial reaction to Vex&rsquo;s cry was one of confusion. The look was mirrored in his friend&rsquo;s faces, as was the sinking dread as they all processed what she&rsquo;d said. He saw Scanlan&rsquo;s eyes take on the fierce coldness they always did whenever they&rsquo;d come across goblins, saw Pike look at the children with a growing look of the same fear Percy felt, saw Keyleth take in all the visitors and civilians just passing through the town square or setting up their stands. </p><p>Of all the worst possible settings for an attack&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Percy said, grasping his own earring. As if his voice had been a sign, the others sprang into action, Grog and Pike rushing to fetch their weapons from respective bags. Percy pulled Tiffany off of Trinket&rsquo;s back as the bear stood, and handed her off to Crispin, who&rsquo;d been staring with trepidation at the adults in their sudden stillness. &ldquo;Take your siblings and get into an inn, tell them to brace for a fight,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>Whitestone had learned from the Briarwoods and the Chroma Conclave. They&rsquo;d made plans for future attacks, the people needed only to be alerted and they would react as needed. </p><p>(Except they hadn&rsquo;t actually needed such strategies in decades, and those strategies had assumed that the threat would come from outside, not from the very heart of the city, and they didn&rsquo;t account for all these visitors, they needed more time to prepare, <i>how in the Nine Hells did goblins get into the heart of Whitestone&mdash;</i>) </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one in the storeroom, I&rsquo;ve got it trapped!&rdquo; Vex&rsquo;s voice drew Percy out of his thoughts. Fuck it, they&rsquo;d have to trust that those who remembered those dark times would guide those who didn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay with the kids and help direct people to safety,&rdquo; Pike said, wrenching her mace free. Then, at the top of her lungs: &ldquo;Everyone get inside, hurry! Keep your kids close! Goblin attack!&rdquo; Crispin, who had looked ready to ask his father for a further explanation, turned white at Pike&rsquo;s call and nodded mutely at Percy, grabbing Arthur by the hand and hoarsely telling the other two to stay close. </p><p>Keyleth grabbed Percy&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna get in the air and see if I can&rsquo;t keep an eye on things, maybe signal to the guards where the rest of the attack is,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Percy said, &ldquo;Stay safe.&rdquo; She pulled away, her form effortlessly shifting into the familiar golden feathers of a giant eagle, and launched herself into the air. Percy looked to Grog and Scanlan and gestured for them to follow him; he didn&rsquo;t have any weapons on him, but they didn&rsquo;t know where the storeroom was, and as sure as he was that a single goblin posed no threat for Vex, even unarmed, it was never just one goblin for long. Trinket seemed to agree, the bear already rumbling past. </p><p>The storehouse wasn&rsquo;t far, but the journey was made difficult by people rushing past in a panic, despite the best efforts of one or two guards and the normal townsfolk to usher them to safely. Word was spreading quickly, it seemed. Trinket, focused purely on coming to Vex&rsquo;s rescue, cleared enough of a path just by charging past that they still arrived quickly enough. </p><p>Upon rounding the final corner, Percy spotted two guards rushing to help his wife, who was holding the door closed. Another bit of movement caught his eye, however; something small and dark was pushing itself through the small, high window on the opposite side of the storehouse from the door. </p><p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he shouted, pointing. The creature turned two huge yellow eyes toward the sound and yelped, struggling even more to squeeze through. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s climbing out the window!&rdquo; </p><p>Scanlan launched a blast of lightning the goblin&rsquo;s way just as it managed to slip out of the window, the bolt crashing by it harmlessly and striking the stone wall of the storehouse. The goblin scrambled to its feet and dashed in a headlong sprint down the alley, Grog and Scanlan both rushing in pursuit. The two guards who&rsquo;d run to Vex stopped by her for a moment, but her angry gesture sent them joining in the chase. </p><p>Percy grabbed Vex by the arm, trying to keep terror from turning his grip into a vice and failing entirely. &ldquo;Are you hurt at all?&rdquo; he asked, frantic. &ldquo;Did it attack you, are you&mdash;&ldquo; </p><p>(He&rsquo;d seen the aftermath of goblin attacks. Parents devastated by watching their children dragged away screaming, houses ransacked, bodies mangled and in some cases <i>eaten, </i>he&rsquo;d seen what goblins could do to people who were caught unawares, and for everything he&rsquo;d seen with his own eyes he&rsquo;d heard dozens of stories about even worse deeds. In his mind he could see all of it, all the horrors and violence, superimposed over Whitestone, over the visitors, over his own children&mdash;) </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fucking fantastic when we&rsquo;ve killed a few bloody goblins,&rdquo; Vex snapped, pushing some hair out of her face. Trinket pressed his head under her free hand and moaned. &ldquo;Yes, darling, I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m okay, it never got the chance to so much as touch me. Gods dammit, how&rsquo;d the little bastards get this far in past our defenses?!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Percy said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to investigate after we&rsquo;ve repelled the initial attack. Hopefully we don&rsquo;t have too many casualties, but with this many strangers in town&mdash;the kids are safe, at least, they&rsquo;ve got Pike with them, but&mdash;&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right, the kids,&rdquo; Vex said. &ldquo;I&mdash;good, that&rsquo;s good. Gods, of all things to go wrong today&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We should fetch Scanlan and Grog, for now, and regroup. They&rsquo;ve probably dealt with the one you spotted, and we need to help the town brace for the full attack.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Vex nodded. Her eyes focused and hardened. &ldquo;Gods damn them for attacking when I&rsquo;ve left Fenthras at home, but we can deal with that, I can make do with any bow in a pinch.&rdquo; Trinket grunted his agreement.</p><p>Instead of the expected bloodbath, however, what Vex and Percy found in the intersection of two alleys was the guards scratching their heads, Grog looking disappointed, and Scanlan looking <i>livid. </i></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Vex asked, looking around. </p><p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Grog. &ldquo;It got away. Not sure where it went.&rdquo; </p><p>Percy stopped and stared at the goliath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;you were outrun by a <i>goblin?</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; </p><p>Trinket sniffed the air, growling softly before lumbering toward a stack of half-broken crates someone had discarded. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to imply anything bad, Grog, I just&mdash;that&rsquo;s really surprising,&rdquo; Percy said, holding his hands up reassuringly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re just as fast as ever, maybe you just got unlucky.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;To be fair, it was a pretty damn quick little runt,&rdquo; Scanlan grumbled. &ldquo;Probably got spooked and ran off to rejoin the rest of them.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Trinket, darling, don&rsquo;t eat that,&rdquo; Vex said absently, as the bear pawed at one of the crates. </p><p>Percy nodded, then turned to the two guards, who stood to attention. &ldquo;Organize a search,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can you send the word out, too, as you go? Tell any stragglers to get inside? Quickly, please, there&rsquo;s no telling how much time left we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo; </p><p>The guards nodded, and sped off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Keyleth&rsquo;ll make lots of noise if she spots the main force,&rdquo; Vex said. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t care how fast this goblin is, none of them are going to outrun her when she&rsquo;s in the sky&mdash;Trinket, I told you, there&rsquo;s nothing to eat in there, stop that, you&rsquo;re going to get a nose full of splinters.&rdquo; </p><p>The bear grunted, but ignored Vex, continuing to push aside some of the partly rotted wood. There was a crack in the wall behind the pile of crates, now that Percy looked. &ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s looking for food while we&rsquo;re under attack,&rdquo; Scanlan grumbled, tail lashing. &ldquo;Fuck, we don&rsquo;t even know which way the little devil went! I can&rsquo;t believe we lost it, the blasted&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>All at once, Trinket went entirely stiff, his occasional grunting replaced by a low, rumbling growl that seemed to vibrate through the very ground. </p><p>&hellip;In fact, if he looked closely, the crack might just be big enough for someone very small to squeeze into, should they need to disappear from sight.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Good bear, Trinket,&rdquo; said Vex, slowly. All four of them changed their stances; Grog stood, a grin splitting his face at the prospect of a return the hunt. Magic swirled around Scanlan&rsquo;s fingertips, shimmering violet smoke beginning to form into fingers beneath him. Vex and Percy, unarmed, braced themselves. </p><p>Trinket shoved his face into the crack as hard as he could, his jaws audibly snapping, only to then pull back with a roar, a thin line of blood dripping off his muzzle as he reared up. The goblin was a blur of shadows as it took the brief opportunity to zip past, narrowly avoiding the bear&rsquo;s claws as he thudded back down onto the ground. Percy and Vex both lurched in an attempt to grab the goblin as it sped past, but it dodged away out of reach, narrowly darting under Grog&rsquo;s axe by fractions of an inch and speeding past. Scanlan sprang up on Bigby&rsquo;s hand, but the goblin had somehow gotten all the way past them, and was scrambling over a fence between two buildings. </p><p>&ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;ll get away that easily, you&rsquo;re in for a <i>shock!</i>&rdquo; Scanlan shouted, magic crackling around his hand. Lightning slammed into where the goblin should have been, blasting a hole in the fence and setting it ablaze, but somehow, the goblin had shifted, narrowly avoiding what seemed like <i>all </i>of the damage from the strike. With a panicked yelp, it disappeared over the fence, the sound of its retreating footsteps almost inaudible over the crackling flames. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/998d385ebfadd83d8cec0b32ba5e1132/tumblr_inline_pfzpmcwrgL1r1p1hw_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Scanlan shouted, soaring on Bigby&rsquo;s hand over the fence. With a bellow, Grog followed suit, knocking a hole in the fence with his axe rather than bothering with climbing over it. </p><p>Vex moved to chase as well, but Percy grabbed her arm. &ldquo;Vex,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Vex, we need to deal with things elsewhere&mdash;we don&rsquo;t even have our weapons, there&rsquo;s not much we can do, leave them to it.&rdquo; </p><p>With a frustrated noise, Vex tugged her arm away and gestured at Trinket, who was attempting to lick at the thin scratch across the bridge of his muzzle. &ldquo;Look at your poor face, gods dammit&mdash;let&rsquo;s just&hellip;go help where we can, I suppose,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>Another blast of magic burst audibly some distance away. &ldquo;Sounds like they&rsquo;ve got that one squared away without us, anyhow,&rdquo; Percy muttered.</p><hr /><p>&lsquo;Nervous&rsquo; was not often a word applicable to the members of the Grey Hunt, but right now, anxiety lingered on all of their faces as they silently watched Vex&rsquo;ahlia pace in front of them. &nbsp;Percy had joined some guards to investigate the storehouse, Scanlan and Grog were still off helping in the search for the main force of the goblins, Keyleth and Pike remained as they were, and Vex was doing some investigating of her own.<br /></p><p>Well, more of an <i>interrogation </i>than an investigation. Percy had his way of seeking answers, and she had hers. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said, pausing, arms crossed. &ldquo;Would any of you would like to explain to me how this happened, exactly?&rdquo; </p><p>The hunters looked at each other, and one spoke up. &ldquo;My lady?&rdquo; he said, and Vex felt cold fury rise within her at the tentative, yet genuine confusion in his voice. </p><p>&ldquo;The bloody goblins!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;You all have one job, one <i>fucking </i>job&mdash;to keep watch over the damned Patchwood. There should have been no way that we find out about goblins only when one breaks into a storeroom in the heart of the fucking city!&rdquo; Several of the hunters cringed at the outburst. Was the guilt she saw sincere or imagined? Who cared, who cared, they <i>should</i> feel guilty&mdash;&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I hear any reports about goblin clan movements in the area? We should have heard about this before they reached the fucking farmlands, nevermind the center of town!&rdquo; <i>It never should have gotten the chance to fool me into&mdash;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Lady Vex&rsquo;ahlia,&rdquo; said one of the hunters, holding out her hand. She was the only one who&rsquo;d been around longer than Vex at this point, actually; she&rsquo;d been a hunter even before the Briarwoods had come, and had helped her greatly with settling into the position of Grand Mistress. &ldquo;My Lady, I understand that you&rsquo;re worried&mdash;we all are, and with fair reason. However, I assure you, no one here would dare slack off under your watch. You&rsquo;ve trained this lot well. If there were no reports of goblins in the area, it&rsquo;s because none were observed, and we have observed the Patchwood as carefully as ever.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There was a weird burst of magic a couple weeks ago, but all we found when we checked was a bunch of angry bluecoats,&rdquo; one of the youngest hunters mumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;Aye, and that a fair distance from the city,&rdquo; said the eldest of the hunters. Vex huffed, but took a deep breath. This was true&mdash;she&rsquo;d remembered that report; she&rsquo;d not been part of the team that investigated, but she knew that it had been handled carefully and turned out to be nothing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how these goblins got in, but we will find out how they slipped past us,&rdquo; she continued. </p><p>&ldquo;See to it that you do,&rdquo; Vex said, dismissing them with a frustrated wave of her hand. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t even find a bunch of bloody <i>goblins, </i>then we&rsquo;ve got a real problem on our hands.&rdquo; </p><p>As the Hunt dispersed, Vex pinched the bridge of her nose. Bloody <i>goblins, </i>of all things to have to deal with&mdash;</p><p>Trinket nudged her arm and moaned softly. Absently, she patted the top of his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, buddy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only goblins. Nothing we can&rsquo;t handle. Just have to find the bloody things&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Shaking herself, she moved towards the tavern Pike had taken the kids to; they&rsquo;d agreed over the earrings to meet up here again to compare notes in about ten minutes. Not that she&rsquo;d have much to offer, just the word of a toddler and the news that the Hunt had apparently missed an entire tribe of goblins. Gods. </p><p>What a nightmare. </p><p>The others trickled toward the rendezvous point slowly, Pike coming first after Cassandra stopped by to pick up the kids and usher them all towards the castle. Percy joined them next, looking very thoughtful; Keyleth swooped down and landed next, her own face worried. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you catch sight of them?&rdquo; Percy asked her. </p><p>Keyleth shook her head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the weird thing,&rdquo; she started, &ldquo;I only&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>A loud, gruff stream of swearing cut her off, as Grog stomped up, Scanlan looking irritable at his side. </p><p>&ldquo;Little fuck got away again!&rdquo; Grog griped, swinging his axe up to rest on one shoulder. &ldquo;I nearly &lsquo;ad it one second, and the next, it was just gone!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It ran between your legs while you were busy overswinging,&rdquo; Scanlan scowled. &ldquo;And <i>then </i>it disappeared.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even get the first goblin?&rdquo; Pike asked, genuinely confused. Percy paused in whatever thoughts had him distracted long enough to fill Pike in on what she&rsquo;d missed whilst guarding the kids.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfd71aa82e14435ee6477e0296afe52f/tumblr_inline_pfzpn9mJxB1r1p1hw_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;It was really fast, Pike!&rdquo; Grog whined. </p><p>&ldquo;And very strange,&rdquo; said Percy. &ldquo;The storehouse was full of all kinds of food, albeit not as much as there was before winter, but there was plenty of dried meats, and none of it very well hidden. Yet as far as I can tell, this goblin was evidently only interested in a bunch of herbs, for some reason. The bags they&rsquo;d been stored in had been ripped open, and there were scraps of them everywhere.&rdquo; </p><p>Scanlan gestured questioningly at Percy. &ldquo;So it made a mess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a goblin. They do that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but what use do goblins have for cooking herbs?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re getting tired of only putting salt and pepper on their grandma stew.&rdquo; <br /><br />\n&ldquo;Scanlan!&rdquo; Pike hissed. </p><p>Vex was barely processing most of the conversation, staring off into the distance and letting the words fly around her. The first goblin&rsquo;s escape grated on her nerves. The thought of the little impost&mdash;<i>intruder </i>getting away untouched burned her. Sweet Sarenrae, it was one bloody goblin, surely they could at least track it to wherever the rest were hiding? They&rsquo;d all brought down a would-be god, but <i>goblins </i>were giving them this much trouble?</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Kiki, you can still point us toward the rest, right?&rdquo; Grog&rsquo;s hopeful voice brought her marginally back to the present. No doubt he was looking forward to the chance to fight something. For once, Vex found herself in similar shoes. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was saying when you guys got here,&rdquo; Keyleth said. &ldquo;I scanned the whole city as best I could several times, but I only ever saw the one goblin. I don&rsquo;t know if there <i>are </i>any others here.&rdquo; </p><p>Scanlan rolled his eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never just one goblin, there&rsquo;s got to be others!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t see any,&rdquo; said Keyleth, leaning forward with a worried stare. </p><p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t get distracted by anything?&rdquo; Vex said. &ldquo;Nothing caught in your eye?&rdquo;</p><p>Keyleth looked hurt. &ldquo;I was&mdash;I tried to be really thorough, and I&rsquo;m telling you, there was only one goblin!&rdquo; </p><p>Vex sighed. She&rsquo;d really meant to keep the scorn out of her voice, there. Keyleth didn&rsquo;t deserve it, she was just&mdash;angry. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure you were, I&rsquo;m sorry, darling. I&rsquo;m just&hellip;stressed out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Did you at least see which way the first one went?&rdquo; Scanlan asked. </p><p>Keyleth shifted and shook her head. &ldquo;I was searching a different part of the city when you two lost track of it, I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry, guys.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;s sakes,&rdquo; Grog growled, letting the head of his axe thump down. </p><p>Scanlan scoffed. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see where the first one went, didn&rsquo;t see the others, maybe you were distracted! Were you paying attention at all?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Scanlan,&rdquo; Percy said, a warning in his voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Guys, hey, don&rsquo;t do this now,&rdquo; Pike cautioned. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Keyleth snapped. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fly up to just fuck around, guys, I was really searching hard! There was only one goblin, I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo; said Keyleth. </p><p>&ldquo;It must have been a scout, then,&rdquo; Vex said, rolling her eyes. &ldquo;Right? It was very quick, and, Scanlan, you said before that it was a small one?&rdquo; </p><p>Scanlan shrugged. &ldquo;Hard to tell under the cloak, but it seemed like it was on the small side for a goblin, yeah.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And we found it where we keep the food. There you are, then, it must&rsquo;ve been a scout,&rdquo; Vex continued. &ldquo;It was sent in ahead of the main force to find out where we keep everything, since it&rsquo;s quick and good at disappearing, evidently. Explains everything.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Almost everything,&rdquo; said Percy. &ldquo;Except for the herbs, which I still don&rsquo;t get&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Does it really matter why it was digging around through something weird?&rdquo; Scanlan groaned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a goblin, Percy, who knows what it was thinking.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I suppose it probably doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, still looking thoughtful. He shook his head. &ldquo;Well, if this was a scout, then the main attack is yet to happen. We&rsquo;ll have to ask everyone to do a head count on their families, check that their kids are safe, and brace to be hit at a later date&hellip;Probably tomorrow, now that I think about it. During a festival would be the time to attack. Although&hellip;whether or not the goblins actually know that we&rsquo;re having a festival is another question entirely, but&hellip;regardless, we&rsquo;d all best make sure we&rsquo;re rested up tonight.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The guards will probably have tracked the goblins down by next morning,&rdquo; Vex said, waving her hand irritably. </p><p>&ldquo;Right, but if they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Percy, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all want to make sure we&rsquo;re at the top of our game. Anyone who can fight will need to be ready to defend those who can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not&hellip;we&rsquo;re not going through with the festival with goblins nearby, are we?&rdquo; said Keyleth. </p><p>Percy sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking with the captain of the guard, and the guards have all been checking in with the townsfolk. A lot of the visitors are scared, but most of the residents are all of the opinion that they&rsquo;re not about to take this without a fight. They&rsquo;re determined to celebrate, whether we in charge like it or not, and plenty of people have already volunteered to act as a militia to help bolster defenses.&rdquo; He shot Keyleth a tired grin. &ldquo;Some of those old enough to remember the Briarwoods have been especially vocal about not hiding away from a threat, and I can&rsquo;t find it in me to tell them they&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; His smile faded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll&hellip;just have to do the best we can, and hope they do track down and destroy the main force before it strikes.&rdquo; </p><p>Keyleth bit her lip. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; she murmured. </p><p>&ldquo;Has anyone been reported missing?&rdquo; Pike said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my first worry, that maybe these ones are sneaky enough to take people quietly, since they&rsquo;ve avoided detection so far.&rdquo; </p><p>Percy shook his head. &ldquo;Not everyone&rsquo;s done a head count, mind you, but so far everyone seems to be accounted for.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They better fuckin&rsquo; attack tomorrow,&rdquo; Grog grumbled. &ldquo;Got all worked up for a fight and then the fuckin&rsquo; goblin got away.&rdquo; </p><p>Pike patted his knee. &ldquo;Aw, buddy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find you somebody to spar with, I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same,&rdquo; Grog complained. &ldquo;I was hopin&rsquo; for a proper fight and some killing and everything, and the stupid slippery little goblin got away!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, maybe we can&rsquo;t do any killing, but you and me can go visit Vasselheim soon, maybe, go defend our titles?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I guess,&rdquo; Grog said, scuffing the ground. </p><p>&ldquo;Who knows, maybe the guards&rsquo;ll miss a few and we&rsquo;ll get to clean up the mess,&rdquo; Scanlan muttered, darkly. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, maybe!&rdquo; said Grog, beaming. </p><p>Pike sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever, let&rsquo;s just&mdash;it&rsquo;s getting late, let&rsquo;s get inside and leave it to the guards,&rdquo; said Vex, heading up the path. More to herself, she added, &ldquo;Pelor willing, the Hunt will follow through on their fucking jobs and find the rest of the little devils while we&rsquo;re all asleep.&rdquo; </p><hr /><p>Aside from a brief pause for Percy to fill the leader of the guard in on what they&rsquo;d discussed, and to confirm that they were going to spend the night seeking out the invaders, the trip back to the castle was blessedly uneventful. After checking in on the kids (who were various levels of shaken, but all unharmed), filling Cassandra in, and getting themselves dinner, they all said their goodnights and headed to bed. </p><p>It was while laying in bed, staring at nothing, that the storm Vex had been fighting for hours finally threatened to break. </p><p>With the day&rsquo;s stress behind her, grief threatened to overwhelm. It had been waiting in the wings all day, and she hated that it had come so easily, after so long, over something so stupid&hellip;She didn&rsquo;t want to think about that now, she didn&rsquo;t want to feel this, she was supposed to be <i>over it </i>after twenty blasted years! </p><p>Groaning softly, she rolled over on her side, as if the action would somehow physically force the old feelings away. It didn&rsquo;t, but it did give her a view of her husband, framed in the soft glow of moonlight, the top buttons on his shirt undone, staring thoughtfully out the window over the city. He had that look about him, the one that spoke of wheels turning furiously behind his eyes, thoughts flying a mile a minute. No doubt, whatever was on his mind was eons more worthwhile than anything plaguing hers. Just about anything had to be more productive than getting worked up over old wounds.</p><p>&ldquo;A copper for your thoughts, darling?&rdquo; she said, shoving her grief and a stray pillow out of the way.</p><p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I just&hellip;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t&mdash;I feel like we&rsquo;re missing something. Something about the goblin&rsquo;s behavior felt&hellip;off, in ways we can&rsquo;t explain even by saying it&rsquo;s probably a scout, I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Ugh. The fucking <i>goblins </i>were the last thing she wanted to think about right now.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Percy,</i>&rdquo; she said, slipping out of bed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just goblins. It&rsquo;s strange that it slipped past our defenses, sure, but we know it&rsquo;s here now, and I&rsquo;m sure the guards will have dealt with it by morning.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed. &ldquo;I&hellip;you&rsquo;re probably right, I know, but something just&hellip;I can&rsquo;t explain it, but something just isn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Padding on nearly silent feet, she crossed to him, pressing herself to his back and loosely wrapping his arms around him. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s a puzzle with you, lately,&rdquo; she murmured, quietly reveling in the way she could feel tension leeching out of him at her touch. &ldquo;Whatever strangeness there may be here doesn&rsquo;t really change things, does it? Unusual goblins are still goblins, there&rsquo;s no point in staying up all night thinking about it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Percy hummed, thoughtfully, leaning back slightly against him. </p><p>A playful grin spread across her face. Slowly, with so little pressure as to feel almost like a ghost, she traced a finger down his arm, all the way down to where his own hand still clutched the windowsill, watching a trail of goosebumps break out behind her touch. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much more&hellip;<i>interesting </i>ways we could spend our time, in any case,&rdquo; she whispered, right next to his ear. Her grin widened as she felt him shiver. &ldquo;Much more worthwhile uses for that scheming mind and those clever hands.&rdquo; She let her fingers tangle with his. </p><p>He swallowed, hard enough for her to hear, and she had to bury her mouth against the back of his neck to hold back a laugh. Twenty years, and it was still so easy to bring that clear flush to his cheeks, <i>gods </i>she loved him so much. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Percy said, curling his hand in hers. </p><p>&ldquo;Come to bed, darling,&rdquo; she whispered, gently tugging him away from the window. Unresisting, he followed.</p><p>There&rsquo;d be time to worry about goblins and old wounds later. For now, they were alone, spring was upon them, and there were far, far better uses for their time.</p></p>",
