                "content": "<p>idk why im bothering to point out the obvious here but septon meribald is not a reliable source of information re: nymeria&rsquo;s pack. his statement on them is actually a blatant example of&nbsp;&ldquo;the unreliability of a story&rdquo; which grrm uses often. (see also: the varying inaccurate accounts of robert and joffreys deaths) meribald has no eyes within this wolf pack therefore he knows nothing of their experiences. but arya does. we have a direct link to the pack through her and we can see the inconsistencies. ie: the wolf pack doesnt just &ldquo;devour&rdquo; man flesh but birds, horses and sheep. because they are animals. they eat what they can get. and generally, in nymeria&rsquo;s own words:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Men on horses [&hellip;] Some of her younger brothers bared their teeth to defend the food they&rsquo;d found, but she snapped at them until they scattered. That was the way of the wild. Deer and hares and crows fled before wolves, *<b>and wolves fled from men</b>.&rdquo;\n\n</p></blockquote><p>but the people of westeros still see them as monsters and it shows in their tales. this is how wolves have been treated throughout human history and its why theyve been so viciously hunted to the point of extinction in many places. they are deeply misunderstood. nymeria is not an evil demon from &ldquo;the seventh hell&rdquo; who eats babies. she is an alpha wolf who protects and provides for her pack. thats who arya is too.</p><p>*unless theyre fucking with arya stark</p>",

We last saw Nymeria when Arya made her run away because she wanted to save Nymeria\u2019s life, when Cersei was gonna kill her if she found her. When she finally finds Nymeria again, or Nymeria finds her, and she of course wants her to come back home with her and be her loyal companion again, but Nymeria\u2019s found her own life. &lsquo;That\u2019s not you&rsquo; is a direct reference to what Arya herself said to her father when her father painted this picture for her of this life she could have as a lady of a castle and marrying some lord and wearing a nice frilly dress. Arya\u2019s not domesticated and it makes total sense that her wolf wouldn\u2019t be either and once the wolf walks away, at first she\u2019s heartbroken to have come this close but then she realizes the wolf is doing exactly what she would do if she were that wolf.",

JUST imagine if the conclusion to this story, was that a poor orphaned boy&nbsp;from Flee Bottom became the ruler of Westeros. Not the main character, but the one we least expect to sit on the Iron Throne. Let&rsquo;s also consider that he&rsquo;s known hard work, he&rsquo;s known hunger, he&rsquo;s been kidnapped, imprisoned and at one point knew he was wanted by Cersei/the Crown. Dead or alive for all he knows. Gendry truly knows the plight of lowborns. So, what better person to rule? Sure, Gendry doesn&rsquo;t know diddly squat about running a kingdom, or the rules of court but there&rsquo;s the small council and that&rsquo;s why he marries a certain Northern girl; who knows the ins and outs of highborn life. Arya experienced must strife with Gendry and together they wouldn&rsquo;t fail the people. Hell, they&rsquo;d shake things up and if anyone would get rid of monarchy it&rsquo;d be Arya and Gendry.&nbsp;</p>",
