Sam uses Corey to scare the rest of the guys, Mase has some deep intellectual conversations with Mr. Stark, Theo and Bucky bond, Scott and Steve hit it off really well, and Lydia and Natasha are just unstoppable. </p><p>The pack forms an allegiance with the Avengers after that, and from then on The Wolves of War help out&nbsp;whenever there is a threat and also have cleared access to any Stark facility&nbsp;at any time. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b01ed54fdbc6b2a51481c7a107eb527/tumblr_pfi3gtgf2s1v07cvn_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",

All that matters are what she thinks of herself. Sitting here right now, in this bed with you Wanda knew she was good enough. She knew she could take on whatever the world threw at her.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you Y/N&rdquo; Wanda whispers, &ldquo;and I promise I&rsquo;ll protect you from all the monsters whether they are in the dark or light.&rdquo; She pulls you towards her, &ldquo;so sleep my love; you have nothing to fear. I promise I&rsquo;ll be here when you wake up&rdquo; Wanda presses a kiss to your forehead and snuggles into your neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Wanda&rdquo; you whisper before sleep finally takes over your body.</p></p>",

        "body": "<p>I\u2019ve literally been building towards what starts in this chapter since I came up with the idea for this AU. It\u2019s what got the idea in my head in the first place. I hope you guys are as excited as I am!</p><p><b>Word count:</b>\u00a01388</p><p><b>Warnings:</b>\u00a0Not the most interesting chapter but really necessary for the story arc. There is a bit of cute fluff at the beginning, though!</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You awoke with the weight of Bucky\u2019s metal arm across your\nstomach, warm from being pressed against your stomach where your shirt had\nridden up. His deep, even breaths tickled the back of your neck and caused you\nto smile. He\u2019d slept soundly all night.</p><p>With a groan and a sigh, Bucky pulled you in closer and\nsnuggled his face into the crook of your shoulder. You tried to wiggle out of\nhis arms to get up but he held you tighter.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cdon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good morning, sleepyhead,\u201d you whispered. \u201cI need to\ngo to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Bucky let out a disgruntled huff but released you. You came\nback over to the bed when you were done.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Bucky patted the bed next to him and gave you his\nbest puppy dog eyes. \u201cSnuggle with me?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to, but I have to get ready for work.\u201d</p><p>His face screwed up. \u201cYou have work today?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his confused expression.\n\u201cYes, Bucky, I have work today. We met on Saturday and yesterday was Sunday.\nToday is Monday and I have to work.\u201d</p><p>It was as though Bucky had made it his goal to make it\nimpossible for you to get ready. He got up and practically hung from your\nshoulders as you selected your outfit for the day, only letting go when you\nshooed him out of the bathroom for your shower. Fortunately by the time you\nwere out, Bucky was no longer in your room. You quickly finished getting ready\nfor the day and headed toward the kitchen to see what you could grab for\nbreakfast.</p><p>The smell of sausage and eggs assailed your senses as you\napproached, and to your surprise you found Bucky in the kitchen, wearing a\ngreen apron and standing over the stove.</p><p>\u201cPerfect timing,\u201d he grinned as you entered. \u201cThe toast\nshould be up any minute and I just finished the sausage and eggs.\u201d The sound of\nthe toast popping up punctuated his sentence.</p><p>You moved to the toaster and pulled the four pieces of bread\nout. \u201cWhat would you like on yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrawberry jam, please,\u201d he replied distractedly as he\nplated the eggs and sausage. </p><p>You went ahead and put jam on all four pieces and brought\nthem to where he was setting the plates on the table. His face lit up when he\nsaw them.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He saw your curious look and explained, \u201cSteve\u2019s the\nonly other one around here who uses enough jam.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, you replied, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got to have enough to\ntaste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d</p><p>The breakfast conversation topics ranged around your\nfavorite foods as the two of you got to know each other. You learned that Bucky\nwould try anything at least once because he was so fascinated by the different\ncuisines from all over the world that could now be found in New York. He was\ntelling you about his favorite Indian restaurant when you realized you had to\nleave immediately if you were going to make it to work on time.</p><p>Without thinking about it, you gave Bucky a quick peck on\nthe cheek as you rushed out. He sat in his chair for several minutes with a big\ngrin on his face before finally getting up to do the dishes.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cOkay, Y/N, spill everything.\u201d Margie practically assaulted\nyou as you entered through the back door. \u201cJon\u2019s been begging me to call you\nall weekend, and if I go home with nothing he just might kill me.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at your coworker\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat do you want\nto know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he like? Is he different with you than with other\npeople? Does the metal arm freak you out at all? Are you going to talk him into\ngetting a haircut?\u201d She sighed. \u201cAlso, Jon wants to know if the sex is amazing,\nbut you don\u2019t have to tell me. Please don\u2019t tell me, actually. Tell me to tell\nhim to forget about ever finding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had sex yet,\u201d you admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s really sweet\nand wants to fall in love with who I am before we go that far, rather than take\nthat step just because we\u2019re soulmates. He\u2019s quieter around most other people,\nbut he doesn\u2019t change his personality for anyone. The metal arm does not freak\nme out and,\u201d you dropped to a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cI may be getting my own\nsoon, but he doesn\u2019t know that yet.\u201d</p><p>Margie\u2019s screech brought Andrew out of his office with his\nphone in hand. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s hurt? Do I need to call 911?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N is getting a metal arm!\u201d </p><p>Andrew sighed and tucked his phone back in his pocket. \u201cAs\nepically cool as that is, could we save the horror film sound effects for\nactual emergencies, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Might</i> be getting\na metal arm,\u201d you corrected Margie. \u201cTony and Bruce think it will work since\nBucky has one, but since I\u2019ve never had a left arm, we\u2019re not positive my brain\nwill know what to do with it. We won\u2019t know until we try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you need leave for recovery when you have it\nattached?\u201d Andrew asked.</p><p>Your eyes grew wide. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that. I\u2019ll ask\nTony tonight what he recommends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and call him,\u201d Andrew suggested. \u201cThe sooner we\ncan plan the schedule, the better. Worst case, I have to help Margie for a\ncouple hours a day until Karen gets here at noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d you nodded, pulling out your phone and\nturning to Margie. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll sanitize the computer keyboards when I\u2019m done. Can\nyou go ahead and get today\u2019s paperwork started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do best,\u201d she replied with a grin. \u201cGo call\nIron Man, with whom you\u2019re now on a first-name basis. Jon is gonna be so\njealous.\u201d</p><p>You laughed and placed your call as she headed out front. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Tony had squealed like a little girl when he heard your\nvoice. Your leave happened much earlier than you were expecting, but your boss\nhad been fully supportive. Happy arrived within the hour to smuggle you back to\nthe tower without Bucky finding out. You wouldn\u2019t be back to work until the\nnext week.</p><p>Shuri had already fabricated your new arm and sent it via\ncourier along with the equipment used to install Bucky\u2019s current arm.

His deep, even breaths tickled the back of your neck and caused you\nto smile. He&rsquo;d slept soundly all night.</p><p>With a groan and a sigh, Bucky pulled you in closer and\nsnuggled his face into the crook of your shoulder. You tried to wiggle out of\nhis arms to get up but he held you tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmm,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, good morning, sleepyhead,&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;I need to\ngo to the bathroom.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky let out a disgruntled huff but released you. You came\nback over to the bed when you were done.</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; Bucky patted the bed next to him and gave you his\nbest puppy dog eyes. &ldquo;Snuggle with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but I have to get ready for work.&rdquo;</p><p>His face screwed up. &ldquo;You have work today?&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at his confused expression.\n&ldquo;Yes, Bucky, I have work today. We met on Saturday and yesterday was Sunday.\nToday is Monday and I have to work.&rdquo;</p><p>It was as though Bucky had made it his goal to make it\nimpossible for you to get ready. He got up and practically hung from your\nshoulders as you selected your outfit for the day, only letting go when you\nshooed him out of the bathroom for your shower. Fortunately by the time you\nwere out, Bucky was no longer in your room. You quickly finished getting ready\nfor the day and headed toward the kitchen to see what you could grab for\nbreakfast.</p><p>The smell of sausage and eggs assailed your senses as you\napproached, and to your surprise you found Bucky in the kitchen, wearing a\ngreen apron and standing over the stove.</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect timing,&rdquo; he grinned as you entered. &ldquo;The toast\nshould be up any minute and I just finished the sausage and eggs.&rdquo; The sound of\nthe toast popping up punctuated his sentence.</p><p>You moved to the toaster and pulled the four pieces of bread\nout. &ldquo;What would you like on yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Strawberry jam, please,&rdquo; he replied distractedly as he\nplated the eggs and sausage. </p><p>You went ahead and put jam on all four pieces and brought\nthem to where he was setting the plates on the table. His face lit up when he\nsaw them.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; He saw your curious look and explained, &ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s the\nonly other one around here who uses enough jam.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughing, you replied, &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got to have enough to\ntaste it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;</p><p>The breakfast conversation topics ranged around your\nfavorite foods as the two of you got to know each other. You learned that Bucky\nwould try anything at least once because he was so fascinated by the different\ncuisines from all over the world that could now be found in New York. He was\ntelling you about his favorite Indian restaurant when you realized you had to\nleave immediately if you were going to make it to work on time.</p><p>Without thinking about it, you gave Bucky a quick peck on\nthe cheek as you rushed out. He sat in his chair for several minutes with a big\ngrin on his face before finally getting up to do the dishes.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Y/N, spill everything.&rdquo; Margie practically assaulted\nyou as you entered through the back door. &ldquo;Jon&rsquo;s been begging me to call you\nall weekend, and if I go home with nothing he just might kill me.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed at your coworker&rsquo;s expression. &ldquo;What do you want\nto know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like? Is he different with you than with other\npeople? Does the metal arm freak you out at all? Are you going to talk him into\ngetting a haircut?&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;Also, Jon wants to know if the sex is amazing,\nbut you don&rsquo;t have to tell me. Please don&rsquo;t tell me, actually. Tell me to tell\nhim to forget about ever finding out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had sex yet,&rdquo; you admitted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really sweet\nand wants to fall in love with who I am before we go that far, rather than take\nthat step just because we&rsquo;re soulmates. He&rsquo;s quieter around most other people,\nbut he doesn&rsquo;t change his personality for anyone. The metal arm does not freak\nme out and,&rdquo; you dropped to a conspiratorial whisper, &ldquo;I may be getting my own\nsoon, but he doesn&rsquo;t know that yet.&rdquo;</p><p>Margie&rsquo;s screech brought Andrew out of his office with his\nphone in hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hurt? Do I need to call 911?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N is getting a metal arm!&rdquo; </p><p>Andrew sighed and tucked his phone back in his pocket. &ldquo;As\nepically cool as that is, could we save the horror film sound effects for\nactual emergencies, please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Might</i> be getting\na metal arm,&rdquo; you corrected Margie. &ldquo;Tony and Bruce think it will work since\nBucky has one, but since I&rsquo;ve never had a left arm, we&rsquo;re not positive my brain\nwill know what to do with it. We won&rsquo;t know until we try it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing you need leave for recovery when you have it\nattached?&rdquo; Andrew asked.</p><p>Your eyes grew wide. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think about that. I&rsquo;ll ask\nTony tonight what he recommends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead and call him,&rdquo; Andrew suggested. &ldquo;The sooner we\ncan plan the schedule, the better. Worst case, I have to help Margie for a\ncouple hours a day until Karen gets here at noon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; you nodded, pulling out your phone and\nturning to Margie. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll sanitize the computer keyboards when I&rsquo;m done. Can\nyou go ahead and get today&rsquo;s paperwork started?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I do best,&rdquo; she replied with a grin. &ldquo;Go call\nIron Man, with whom you&rsquo;re now on a first-name basis. Jon is gonna be so\njealous.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed and placed your call as she headed out front. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Tony had squealed like a little girl when he heard your\nvoice. Your leave happened much earlier than you were expecting, but your boss\nhad been fully supportive. Happy arrived within the hour to smuggle you back to\nthe tower without Bucky finding out. You wouldn&rsquo;t be back to work until the\nnext week.</p><p>Shuri had already fabricated your new arm and sent it via\ncourier along with the equipment used to install Bucky&rsquo;s current arm. It was\neven more beautiful than you had imagined it would be. Looking at it, you felt\na burst of excitement bubble up in your stomach. You were getting an arm just\nlike Bucky&rsquo;s!</p><p>Bruce talked to you through the prep for your procedure,\ntelling you what to expect and how long it would likely take.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure how the anesthetic will work since you&rsquo;re\naffected by the same serum as Bucky,&rdquo; he told you, &ldquo;but since we want to\nsurprise him with your arm and he&rsquo;ll feel anything you feel during the\nprocedure, we&rsquo;re going to knock you both out. That combined anesthetic, without\nactually having the double dose in your system, should be enough. F.R.I.D.A.Y.\nwill be monitoring just in case. You still want to do this?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded. &ldquo;I really do. How are you going to knock Bucky\nout without telling him, though?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got our best people on it,&rdquo; Tony laughed, coming\nin. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one better for the job.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sent Clint, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I sent Clint.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Clint grinned to himself as he stalked his prey, crawling\nthrough the air ducts above the common room.
