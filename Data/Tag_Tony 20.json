So relieved to hear his voice, to feel him embrace again after a long terrifying 22 days. More or less, I was relieved our little baby was gonna have their father. </p><p>Tony has yet to find out though. It&rsquo;s been two weeks since he returned and I have been nursing him back to health with Bruce. I wanted to tell him when he wasn&rsquo;t so near death and a pile of bones. </p><p>I sat with Tony in the physical therapy room, helping Tony do some stretching. The lack of food and malnutrition caused his muscles to get really weak, but after all of this physical therapy, he&rsquo;s been able to walk on his own and his muscle is rebuilding well.</p><p>The baby bumb was already starting to form, and I don&rsquo;t know if Tony had nessicarlly even noticed. But I wore a sweater in attempt to hide it as well as I could.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I wanna try lifting the 15 pound dumbbell.&rdquo; Tony says standing up. &ldquo;Woahhh there, trying to get shredded or what?&rdquo; I tease. He smirks and rolls his eyes. 15lbs is a big deal in our book, considering he couldn&rsquo;t lift a full pound when he got home. He picked it up with very little struggle and curled it a few times.</p><p>He looked over at me and winked and flexed making me chuckle. I watch him for a few moments and realize this is a good time. &ldquo;Tony, we need to talk.&rdquo; I say. Tony puts down the dumbbell and quirks his brow. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s never good.&rdquo; He mumbles, walking back towards me on the bench. </p><p>I laugh softly and shake my head. &ldquo;I think this might be the one good thing in our life.&rdquo; I say with a small smile. Tony, still with a look of confusion, sits down besides me and takes my hand and gives it a small squeeze. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up honey?&rdquo; Tony says, his voice as smooth as the nickname. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony, remember the day you went into space, when we went to the park.&rdquo; I start off. &ldquo;How could I forget? It was the worse day of my life getting my ass handed to me on a platter.&rdquo; Tony mumbles, looking down. I give him a small frown and squeeze his hand. &ldquo;Before, <i>everyone</i>, got their ass handed to them. Our conversation in the park, remember?&rdquo; I say. </p><p>Tony looks up at, his soft brown eyes locking with mine. &ldquo;A-about my dream?&rdquo; He whispers. &ldquo;Well, after you left. I decided to go see. I went to the store and bought a test, took it, and whatcha know, you&rsquo;re psych.&rdquo; I say, a small smile tugging at my lips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I tried to call you and our call was dropped.&rdquo; I whisper. Tony&rsquo;s eyes fill with tears. </p><p>I gently lay my hand against Tony&rsquo;s cheek, my thumb whipping away some of the tears that spilled out. &ldquo;Oh Y/n, I-I&rsquo;m so sorry, I should&rsquo;ve c-came ho-&rdquo;  &ldquo;No. No don&rsquo;t do that Tony. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matter is your here, alive, with me, and our baby.&rdquo; I cut him off. Tony smiles, some tears still stained on his cheeks. He turns his head in my hand and kisses my palm. Then leaning forward, placing his soft lips onto mine. </p><p>He pulls away, a big grin still on his face. He leans down and lifts up my shirt, admiring my small bump. &ldquo;Hi sweetheart, this is your daddy. I promise I&rsquo;m gonna take such good care of you, such, such good care of you.&rdquo; He whispers the last part, placing a soft kiss on my stomach.</p><p>I smile down at him, running my hands through his brown hair. &ldquo;Ya know, it still could be a boy.&rdquo; I say, tears of my own welling in my eyes. &ldquo;Well my dream has been right so far, little Morgan, my sweetie wee.&rdquo; He says, placing another kiss on the bump. </p><p>He sits up, pulling my sweater back down and pulls me into his arms. &ldquo;I love you Y/n.&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;I love you too To-&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m cut off when Steve comes walking into the door. &ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; He says. Tony pulls away, lightly grimacing at me before turning around to face Steve. &ldquo;Cap.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;Tony we found Thanos, we are leaving right now, you coming?&rdquo; He says. Worry hits me hard. I bite my lip to keep from crying, though my eyes sting. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be the one to stop Tony from being a hero, but god the thought of him leaving me and almost dying again hurts so bad. I sigh and hold my head down, knowing there is no point in trying to stop Tony, since he always wants to go towards the fight. It&rsquo;s embedded in him.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice says. I look up, tears filling my eyes again. &ldquo;What? Tony this is our only cha- &quot;I said no Cap. I am not joining this fight anymore. I already fought the fight, I won&rsquo;t go back.&rdquo; Tony says standing up. He turns around and gently takes my hand, making me stand up besides him. &ldquo;Not when I have everything right here.&rdquo; He whispers, his arm sliding behind my back along my waist.</p><p>Steve scoffs and walks away. Tony turns and looks at me, his hand cupping my cheeks, wiping way the tears that had slipped. &ldquo;I am never leaving you again Y/n, you, or our little Morgan, I promise.&rdquo; He whispers. I nod, a soft sob escaping my lips. I wrapped my arms around him and he did then same, kissing my head lightly.</p>",

More or less, I was relieved our little baby was gonna have their father. </p><p>Tony has yet to find out though. It\u2019s been two weeks since he returned and I have been nursing him back to health with Bruce. I wanted to tell him when he wasn\u2019t so near death and a pile of bones. </p><p>I sat with Tony in the physical therapy room, helping Tony do some stretching. The lack of food and malnutrition caused his muscles to get really weak, but after all of this physical therapy, he\u2019s been able to walk on his own and his muscle is rebuilding well.</p><p>The baby bumb was already starting to form, and I don\u2019t know if Tony had nessicarlly even noticed.

He smirks and rolls his eyes. 15lbs is a big deal in our book, considering he couldn\u2019t lift a full pound when he got home. He picked it up with very little struggle and curled it a few times.</p><p>He looked over at me and winked and flexed making me chuckle. I watch him for a few moments and realize this is a good time. \u201cTony, we need to talk.\u201d I say. Tony puts down the dumbbell and quirks his brow. \u201cThat\u2019s never good.\u201d He mumbles, walking back towards me on the bench. </p><p>I laugh softly and shake my head. \u201cI think this might be the one good thing in our life.\u201d I say with a small smile. Tony, still with a look of confusion, sits down besides me and takes my hand and gives it a small squeeze. \u201cWhat\u2019s up honey?\u201d Tony says, his voice as smooth as the nickname. </p><p>\u201cTony, remember the day you went into space, when we went to the park.\u201d I start off. \u201cHow could I forget? It was the worse day of my life getting my ass handed to me on a platter.\u201d Tony mumbles, looking down. I give him a small frown and squeeze his hand. \u201cBefore, <i>everyone</i>, got their ass handed to them. Our conversation in the park, remember?\u201d I say. </p><p>Tony looks up at, his soft brown eyes locking with mine. \u201cA-about my dream?\u201d He whispers. \u201cWell, after you left. I decided to go see. I went to the store and bought a test, took it, and whatcha know, you\u2019re psych.\u201d I say, a small smile tugging at my lips. \u201cThat\u2019s why I tried to call you and our call was dropped.\u201d I whisper. Tony\u2019s eyes fill with tears. </p><p>I gently lay my hand against Tony\u2019s cheek, my thumb whipping away some of the tears that spilled out. \u201cOh Y/n, I-I\u2019m so sorry, I should\u2019ve c-came ho-\u201d  \u201cNo. No don\u2019t do that Tony. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matter is your here, alive, with me, and our baby.\u201d I cut him off. Tony smiles, some tears still stained on his cheeks. He turns his head in my hand and kisses my palm. Then leaning forward, placing his soft lips onto mine. </p><p>He pulls away, a big grin still on his face. He leans down and lifts up my shirt, admiring my small bump. \u201cHi sweetheart, this is your daddy. I promise I\u2019m gonna take such good care of you, such, such good care of you.\u201d He whispers the last part, placing a soft kiss on my stomach.</p><p>I smile down at him, running my hands through his brown hair. \u201cYa know, it still could be a boy.\u201d I say, tears of my own welling in my eyes. \u201cWell my dream has been right so far, little Morgan, my sweetie wee.\u201d He says, placing another kiss on the bump. </p><p>He sits up, pulling my sweater back down and pulls me into his arms. \u201cI love you Y/n.\u201d Tony says. \u201cI love you too To-\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m cut off when Steve comes walking into the door. \u201cTony.\u201d He says. Tony pulls away, lightly grimacing at me before turning around to face Steve. \u201cCap.\u201d He says. \u201cTony we found Thanos, we are leaving right now, you coming?\u201d He says. Worry hits me hard. I bite my lip to keep from crying, though my eyes sting. </p><p>I don\u2019t wanna be the one to stop Tony from being a hero, but god the thought of him leaving me and almost dying again hurts so bad. I sigh and hold my head down, knowing there is no point in trying to stop Tony, since he always wants to go towards the fight. It\u2019s embedded in him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice says. I look up, tears filling my eyes again. \u201cWhat? Tony this is our only cha- \"I said no Cap. I am not joining this fight anymore. I already fought the fight, I won\u2019t go back.\u201d Tony says standing up. He turns around and gently takes my hand, making me stand up besides him. \u201cNot when I have everything right here.\u201d He whispers, his arm sliding behind my back along my waist.</p><p>Steve scoffs and walks away. Tony turns and looks at me, his hand cupping my cheeks, wiping way the tears that had slipped. \u201cI am never leaving you again Y/n, you, or our little Morgan, I promise.\u201d He whispers. I nod, a soft sob escaping my lips. I wrapped my arms around him and he did then same, kissing my head lightly.</p></p>",

Just meant to rest my eyes for a second!&rdquo; Before Tony can say anything, Peter looks at his watch. &ldquo;Look at the time! It&rsquo;s super late! Going to bed! Night!&rdquo;</p><p>The boy nearly flies out of the lab and past a now entering Stephen with a quick &lsquo;Night Mom!&rsquo;, and leaves both parents looking baffled.

Night!&rdquo;</p><p>The boy nearly flies out of the lab and past a now entering Stephen with a quick &lsquo;Night Mom!&rsquo;, and leaves both parents looking baffled. The sorcerer recovers first and enters the room, leaving the door to slide shut behind him, and he takes Peter&rsquo;s previously occupied spot. Tony took a little while longer to recover. Peter had been acting weird and it was always like pulling teeth when it came to getting the boy out of the lab for the night. He went willingly this time though.&nbsp; As if he was hiding something. Tony knew those papers weren&rsquo;t homework, but it was likely just new upgrade ideas for their suits or even new web formulas.</p><p>Of course, Peter tended to leave those ideas in the lab.</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t some really convincing copy of our son was it?&rdquo; Tony finally asks.</p><p>Stephen furrows his brows. &ldquo;No. He <i>has</i> been acting strange though. I walked into his room earlier this afternoon to ask him what he wanted for lunch and he slammed his laptop closed. You know what he said?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shrugs, grabs the wanted wrench off the worktable, and returns to his project. &ldquo;Chicken salad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Porn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh. That&rsquo;s not what he usually wan&ndash;wait. What?!&rdquo; Tony looks over at his husband with bewilderment.</p><p>&ldquo;I think he thought I asked what he was doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t a huge red flag telling us he&rsquo;s doing something he&rsquo;s not supposed to, I don&rsquo;t know what is.&rdquo;</p><p>It only got weirder.</p><p>Peter moved on from suspicious activities to constantly hounding them about something or another. Like favorite foods or favorite music. Stephen eventually came to the assumption that the teen had to do an essay of some sort about his parents but was too embarrassed to say anything, but Tony nixed that. The genius said Peter would have fun with an essay like that, but any problems about it would be at school with students who still didn&rsquo;t quite believe he was actually adopted by two Avengers.</p><p>Nevermind that there was a whole news story about it that ran for two months. It only ran so long because everyone had to put in their two cents about Tony&rsquo;s ability to parent properly and keep Peter safe. Yes, it was hard sometimes, mostly because the safe part was hard when Peter put himself in danger every night because he was Spiderman, but Tony made him a suit. Actual parenting? At least if Peter drove him up the wall, he could pawn him off on Stephen. He could switch to Mama Bear so fast and the teen had a love/hate relationship with the sorcerer&rsquo;s 'maternal&rsquo; side.</p><p>He loved when it wasn&rsquo;t directed at him.</p><p>He hated it when it was.</p><p>Unless of course snuggling was involved, then one would need to get a crowbar to separate the two.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you two doing tonight?&rdquo; Peter asks a couple of days later.</p><p>Tony and Stephen look up at him from their respective beverages across the island counter before the mechanic shrugs.</p><p>&ldquo;Probably just going to order take-out and watch a movie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Well in that case&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boss.&rdquo; Friday interrupts. &ldquo;There are a group of people running around the city with alien tech. I&rsquo;ve detected that they&rsquo;ve planted a few power cores already as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groans. &ldquo;Hold that thought Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, they never got back to the conversation. By the time they took care of the 'crazy people with alien guns&rsquo; (Scott&rsquo;s words), it was late and they were all too tired to do anything but what Tony originally planned. They ordered take-out, watched a movie while they ate, and then retired for bed.</p><p>Peter tried again the next morning but Stephen shook his head. &ldquo;I have to check on the Sanctums and go to Kamar-Taj for a couple of days. Maybe more if the other masters have something for me to deal with.&rdquo;</p><p>And that was that. Stephen left through a portal and was gone for a week. He came back exhausted and injured, so Peter left him alone until he had healed and rested. That took another week.</p><p>The third time Peter was going to ask about their plans, he couldn&rsquo;t even open his mouth before Tony&rsquo;s phone was ringing. Stephen did seem to notice the teen&rsquo;s exasperation though.</p><p>&ldquo;Another meeting? What&rsquo;s it about this time? A schedule to cough? Pep-&rdquo; </p><p>Peter snatches his father&rsquo;s phone from him and holds it up to his ear. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s busy! Things are already planned!&rdquo; Both parents stare incredulously at their son while he talks to Pepper. &ldquo;Yes. No&hellip;I told you&hellip;okay. Thanks Aunt Pepper.&rdquo; Peter hangs up and drops the phone in Tony&rsquo;s lap as he turns toward Stephen. &ldquo;No sorcerer duties today for you either. I already talked to Wong and he&rsquo;ll take care of things for the rest of the night.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen cocks his head. &ldquo;When did you talk to Wong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;the more important question would be what the fuck?&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>Peter only smiles at them. &ldquo;Go get dressed. Something not too fancy but not too casual either.&rdquo;</p><p>Both men stand and the teen pushes them toward their bedroom, and then to the elevator once they come out dressed accordingly. They both chose dress shirts (Tony wore a dark red, and Stephen a dark blue) and black slacks, and to Peter&rsquo;s satisfaction, left the ties behind.</p><p>Now they were just trying to figure out what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, if you wanted to go do something you just needed to ask.&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. It&rsquo;s not for me. It&rsquo;s for you two.&rdquo; He shoves them into the elevator and grins. &ldquo;Have fun on your date! To the garage Friday!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony and Stephen stare at the doors of the elevator when they close and then look at each other. Their kid planned a date night for them? They stand in stunned silence as the elevator descends to the garage floor, and when the elevator doors open, they find Happy standing against one of Tony&rsquo;s cars.</p><p>Tony points at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in on it too?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So is Pepper. She made reservations for dinner. You&rsquo;ve got a good kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She called me about a meeting!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that was planned. She knew you would complain and that was Peter&rsquo;s signal to take the phone and make sure everything was ready.&rdquo; Happy opens the back door and Tony slides in while Stephen hesitates. &ldquo;Peter asked me to drive <i>extra</i> careful for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen smiles softly. The teen even thought of the sorcerer&rsquo;s unease with driving.  &ldquo;Of course he did.&rdquo;</p><p>He climbs in next to Tony and the driver closes the door before getting into the front seat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put up the divider so you don&rsquo;t scar me for life.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grins. &ldquo;You know what that means Stephanie?&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen smirks. &ldquo;We have to be <i>extra</i> loud.&rdquo;</p><p>Happy rolls his eyes and the last thing they hear before the divider closes is a mumbled, &ldquo;I hate you guys.&rdquo;</p></p>",
