Coffee and sweets every morning, sent her lunch, he gave up when she had a messenger sent and the message was the same as her last words to him.</p><!-- more --><p>He shook his head and offered the man before him a wry smile, \u201cto what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Sean Beaudry grunted as he sat and glanced around the room quickly, he gave a curt nod, \u201cthank you&hellip; for seeing me.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, \u201cit\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d He poked around the desk, \u201ch-how is Ms. Moses these days? I assume that is why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>The man shifted in his seat and looked down at his hands before nodding, \u201cshe would&hellip; would beat me if she found out I came.\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow, \u201cshe\u2019s been&hellip; off since her last meeting with you. I think she expected- not sure what she expected really, I don\u2019t know what happened between you two either&hellip;?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, it was an argument,\u201d Tony waved a hand, a heavy sigh leaving him.</p><p>\u201cHey, first off, cause I know Ash hasn\u2019t said it, thank you for the equipment. The precinct needed it and it\u2019s something everyone is grateful for, state\u2019s funds aren\u2019t what they used to be. The new vests are amazing and the riot shields? Not to mention the everyday uniforms&hellip;really you went above and beyond.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head, \u201cit was nothing really.\u201d She had made a point, he had looked into it and found the locals were seriously underfunded. His first purchase had been the vests.</p><p>Beaudry nodded, suppressing a smirk, he knew Ash and he knew she must have hit a nerve with him.\u201cListen, Ash is pretty reckless on any given day, but she\u2019s been throwing herself more and more into training. Sticking herself into business that isn\u2019t hers and I\u2019m not sure what I am really asking here, not even sure what this argument between you two was about. Look,\u201d he took in a deep breath and pursed his lips, \u201cas long as I\u2019ve known Ash she\u2019s always been driven to not be distracted from her work. She loves what she does you know? I mean we all do,\u201d he shrugged. </p><p>\u201cAsh and the rest of us, we were stuck together, the boss told her we would fail, we would end up getting kicked. This lit a fire inside her and she\u2019s done turned us around, I mean, we can\u2019t let this small chick go into a major drug trafficking house alone and not look like a pack of bitch ass pussies.\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned, \u201cwhy does it not surprise me that she\u2019s the leader of your group?\u201d</p><p>Beaudry snickered leaning back in his chair. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m saying here&hellip; she just seemed&hellip;. different having you around. She\u2019s not gonna say it, but I can see whatever she said to you is getting to her and it\u2019s not good when she gets distracted.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded and met his gaze, the two staring at each other for a moment.</p><p>***</p><p>Ash didn\u2019t understand herself why she had been more reckless than usual. It was a frustration that seemed to be seething within her. She refused to believe that it started when she had stomped out of the restaurant so long ago. Refused to believe that she missed the stupid phone calls and stupid flowers he sent. </p><p>Who the fuck cared about flowers anyway?</p><p>The equipment had been nice, that damned vest had been long overdue to be replaced. She had used it more than once not that she would ever tell Sean about that, he would kill her if he knew it had been compromised. Shit, she had been on the verge of knitting it back together.</p><p>Hanging her head she replayed her childish tantrum and groaned quietly to herself. He hadn\u2019t deserved that at all. She had always hated seeing him be the one to face all those government officials, always lobbying for the good of his team, she knew what that felt like. Everybody being against you, nobody willing to believe in you or yours, never giving up on the small family unit she had put together&hellip; she growled to herself. They were too much alike anyhow, those things never worked out, work always took most of her time&hellip; not like she was going to apologize, she ran a hand down her face.</p><p>\u201cMoses?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, determination in her green eyes and nodded. She knew that Sean would be beyond angry at her, but honestly the guys had been on her ass for the last month and it was suffocating.</p><p>She could take care of herself. She needed to remind herself of that.</p><p>If she wanted to take on extra shifts with another team she could. She had shouldered her gear and grunted when the Captain congratulated her on trying to move up, work with others that wouldn\u2019t drag her down. It wasn\u2019t that, she just wanted a moment to fucking breathe. </p><p>Just breathe.</p><p>It was odd working with another team, they were not as coordinated as her guys, they seemed to be struggling to keep together but she kept her head low moving through the rooms of the building. </p><p>Another drug den, she couldn\u2019t help but growl in frustration. You would think they had cleared these out. That with the world falling apart into disarray, aliens coming to earth, super beings popping up like mad&hellip; men dressing up in armor&hellip; Ash let out a little sigh, more and more seemed to find comfort in drugs.</p><p>\u201cWhy is there another unit joining ours?\u201d she heard, two men ahead of her turned and stared at her. Fuck. </p><p>\u201cMoses? Clear out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaudry fuck off, we\u2019re almost done here.\u201d She bit back over her comm, she had known, just known it was them. She jutted her chin at the two men in front of her, \u201ckeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoses stand down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegative. Last floor to be cleared,\u201d she answered, rifle held up and against her shoulder as they swept the first room. </p><p>\u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>She could feel her blood boil and tore her earpiece out as Beaudry demanded her to stand down once again. \u201cMother fucker, lets get this done,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The two men nodded and pushed forwards. The second room opened up and led to a number of doors. Ash stepped across the open space, her breath came out slowly, one of the men stepping in front of her as a door opened to their right. </p><p>Ash knew it wasn\u2019t good, knew this was gonna hurt. She shoved her shoulder hard into the man in front of her throwing him down with all her strength, lifting her rifle back up as the crack of gun fire exploded and the room became smaller. It was getting harder to breath under her helmet, she fell to a knee, rolling and taking cover behind a couch.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she growled and replaced her earpiece, grimacing when she heard Beaudry\u2019s voice biting curses at her. \u201cShut up and tell me you\u2019re on the last floor already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we got surprised down here. Handling our own shit, but got a friend headed in for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I don\u2019t have tim-\u201d there was a loud cracking sound, the wall caving in as concrete and bricks exploded into the room. Ash couldn\u2019t help the scream that tore from her lips as she was thrown down, coughing she shoved to her knee\u2019s, rifle back up.</p><p>There in front of her was the Iron Man.</p><p>\u201cMiss me honey?\u201d<br/>\u201cUn-fucking-believable,\u201d she uttered under her breath, pulling her helmet off as she looked up at him from her spot on the floor. She sucked in a quick breath as he ran towards her, her arms coming up to defend herself. A small squeak escaping her as he wrapped his arm around her, lifting her off her feet and swinging her around, his body shielding her from the onslaught of bullets. She stared up at him as he raised his free hand, propulsion blast sending men flying back as the two men that had accompanied her scrambled out the door.</p><p>Ash wondered briefly what it was like to dawn the metal suit, how much did it weigh? How many bruises did he accumulate every time he wore it? God he must be exhausted&hellip; Ash didn\u2019t like that she was becoming concerned about him and his well being.</p><p>Tony looked down once the dust settled, she was shoving against him, struggling to get out of his grasp,he ignored her attempts till he saw Sean come through the door, gun raised, and looking very intimidating. He finally allowed her to pull away, \u201cOfficer Beaudry&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Sean lowered his weapon, \u201cTony.\u201d <br/><br/></p><p>****<br/></p><p>A/N: Leave me comments??</p><p>Perma

Coffee and sweets every morning, sent her lunch, he gave up when she had a messenger sent and the message was the same as her last words to him.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He shook his head and offered the man before him a wry smile, \u201cto what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Sean Beaudry grunted as he sat and glanced around the room quickly, he gave a curt nod, \u201cthank you\u2026 for seeing me.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, \u201cit\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d He poked around the desk, \u201ch-how is Ms. Moses these days? I assume that is why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>The man shifted in his seat and looked down at his hands before nodding, \u201cshe would\u2026 would beat me if she found out I came.\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow, \u201cshe\u2019s been\u2026 off since her last meeting with you. I think she expected- not sure what she expected really, I don\u2019t know what happened between you two either\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, it was an argument,\u201d Tony waved a hand, a heavy sigh leaving him.</p><p>\u201cHey, first off, cause I know Ash hasn\u2019t said it, thank you for the equipment. The precinct needed it and it\u2019s something everyone is grateful for, state\u2019s funds aren\u2019t what they used to be. The new vests are amazing and the riot shields? Not to mention the everyday uniforms\u2026really you went above and beyond.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head, \u201cit was nothing really.\u201d She had made a point, he had looked into it and found the locals were seriously underfunded. His first purchase had been the vests.</p><p>Beaudry nodded, suppressing a smirk, he knew Ash and he knew she must have hit a nerve with him.\u201cListen, Ash is pretty reckless on any given day, but she\u2019s been throwing herself more and more into training. Sticking herself into business that isn\u2019t hers and I\u2019m not sure what I am really asking here, not even sure what this argument between you two was about. Look,\u201d he took in a deep breath and pursed his lips, \u201cas long as I\u2019ve known Ash she\u2019s always been driven to not be distracted from her work. She loves what she does you know? I mean we all do,\u201d he shrugged. </p><p>\u201cAsh and the rest of us, we were stuck together, the boss told her we would fail, we would end up getting kicked. This lit a fire inside her and she\u2019s done turned us around, I mean, we can\u2019t let this small chick go into a major drug trafficking house alone and not look like a pack of bitch ass pussies.\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned, \u201cwhy does it not surprise me that she\u2019s the leader of your group?\u201d</p><p>Beaudry snickered leaning back in his chair. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m saying here\u2026 she just seemed\u2026. different having you around. She\u2019s not gonna say it, but I can see whatever she said to you is getting to her and it\u2019s not good when she gets distracted.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded and met his gaze, the two staring at each other for a moment.</p><p>***</p><p>Ash didn\u2019t understand herself why she had been more reckless than usual. It was a frustration that seemed to be seething within her. She refused to believe that it started when she had stomped out of the restaurant so long ago. Refused to believe that she missed the stupid phone calls and stupid flowers he sent. </p><p>Who the fuck cared about flowers anyway?</p><p>The equipment had been nice, that damned vest had been long overdue to be replaced. She had used it more than once not that she would ever tell Sean about that, he would kill her if he knew it had been compromised. Shit, she had been on the verge of knitting it back together.</p><p>Hanging her head she replayed her childish tantrum and groaned quietly to herself. He hadn\u2019t deserved that at all. She had always hated seeing him be the one to face all those government officials, always lobbying for the good of his team, she knew what that felt like. Everybody being against you, nobody willing to believe in you or yours, never giving up on the small family unit she had put together\u2026 she growled to herself. They were too much alike anyhow, those things never worked out, work always took most of her time\u2026 not like she was going to apologize, she ran a hand down her face.</p><p>\u201cMoses?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, determination in her green eyes and nodded. She knew that Sean would be beyond angry at her, but honestly the guys had been on her ass for the last month and it was suffocating.</p><p>She could take care of herself. She needed to remind herself of that.</p><p>If she wanted to take on extra shifts with another team she could. She had shouldered her gear and grunted when the Captain congratulated her on trying to move up, work with others that wouldn\u2019t drag her down. It wasn\u2019t that, she just wanted a moment to fucking breathe. </p><p>Just breathe.</p><p>It was odd working with another team, they were not as coordinated as her guys, they seemed to be struggling to keep together but she kept her head low moving through the rooms of the building. </p><p>Another drug den, she couldn\u2019t help but growl in frustration. You would think they had cleared these out. That with the world falling apart into disarray, aliens coming to earth, super beings popping up like mad\u2026 men dressing up in armor\u2026 Ash let out a little sigh, more and more seemed to find comfort in drugs.</p><p>\u201cWhy is there another unit joining ours?\u201d she heard, two men ahead of her turned and stared at her. Fuck. </p><p>\u201cMoses? Clear out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaudry fuck off, we\u2019re almost done here.\u201d She bit back over her comm, she had known, just known it was them. She jutted her chin at the two men in front of her, \u201ckeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoses stand down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegative. Last floor to be cleared,\u201d she answered, rifle held up and against her shoulder as they swept the first room. </p><p>\u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>She could feel her blood boil and tore her earpiece out as Beaudry demanded her to stand down once again. \u201cMother fucker, lets get this done,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The two men nodded and pushed forwards. The second room opened up and led to a number of doors. Ash stepped across the open space, her breath came out slowly, one of the men stepping in front of her as a door opened to their right. </p><p>Ash knew it wasn\u2019t good, knew this was gonna hurt. She shoved her shoulder hard into the man in front of her throwing him down with all her strength, lifting her rifle back up as the crack of gun fire exploded and the room became smaller. It was getting harder to breath under her helmet, she fell to a knee, rolling and taking cover behind a couch.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she growled and replaced her earpiece, grimacing when she heard Beaudry\u2019s voice biting curses at her. \u201cShut up and tell me you\u2019re on the last floor already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we got surprised down here. Handling our own shit, but got a friend headed in for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I don\u2019t have tim-\u201d there was a loud cracking sound, the wall caving in as concrete and bricks exploded into the room. Ash couldn\u2019t help the scream that tore from her lips as she was thrown down, coughing she shoved to her knee\u2019s, rifle back up.</p><p>There in front of her was the Iron Man.</p><p>\u201cMiss me honey?\u201d<br>\u201cUn-fucking-believable,\u201d she uttered under her breath, pulling her helmet off as she looked up at him from her spot on the floor. She sucked in a quick breath as he ran towards her, her arms coming up to defend herself. A small squeak escaping her as he wrapped his arm around her, lifting her off her feet and swinging her around, his body shielding her from the onslaught of bullets. She stared up at him as he raised his free hand, propulsion blast sending men flying back as the two men that had accompanied her scrambled out the door.</p><p>Ash wondered briefly what it was like to dawn the metal suit, how much did it weigh? How many bruises did he accumulate every time he wore it? God he must be exhausted\u2026 Ash didn\u2019t like that she was becoming concerned about him and his well being.</p><p>Tony looked down once the dust settled, she was shoving against him, struggling to get out of his grasp,he ignored her attempts till he saw Sean come through the door, gun raised, and looking very intimidating. He finally allowed her to pull away, \u201cOfficer Beaudry\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sean lowered his weapon, \u201cTony.\u201d <br><br></p><p>****<br></p><p>A/N: Leave me comments??</p><p>Perma

Coffee and sweets every morning, sent her lunch, he gave up when she had a messenger sent and the message was the same as her last words to him.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He shook his head and offered the man before him a wry smile, \u201cto what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Sean Beaudry grunted as he sat and glanced around the room quickly, he gave a curt nod, \u201cthank you\u2026 for seeing me.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, \u201cit\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d He poked around the desk, \u201ch-how is Ms. Moses these days? I assume that is why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>The man shifted in his seat and looked down at his hands before nodding, \u201cshe would\u2026 would beat me if she found out I came.\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow, \u201cshe\u2019s been\u2026 off since her last meeting with you. I think she expected- not sure what she expected really, I don\u2019t know what happened between you two either\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, it was an argument,\u201d Tony waved a hand, a heavy sigh leaving him.</p><p>\u201cHey, first off, cause I know Ash hasn\u2019t said it, thank you for the equipment. The precinct needed it and it\u2019s something everyone is grateful for, state\u2019s funds aren\u2019t what they used to be. The new vests are amazing and the riot shields? Not to mention the everyday uniforms\u2026really you went above and beyond.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head, \u201cit was nothing really.\u201d She had made a point, he had looked into it and found the locals were seriously underfunded. His first purchase had been the vests.</p><p>Beaudry nodded, suppressing a smirk, he knew Ash and he knew she must have hit a nerve with him.\u201cListen, Ash is pretty reckless on any given day, but she\u2019s been throwing herself more and more into training. Sticking herself into business that isn\u2019t hers and I\u2019m not sure what I am really asking here, not even sure what this argument between you two was about. Look,\u201d he took in a deep breath and pursed his lips, \u201cas long as I\u2019ve known Ash she\u2019s always been driven to not be distracted from her work. She loves what she does you know? I mean we all do,\u201d he shrugged. </p><p>\u201cAsh and the rest of us, we were stuck together, the boss told her we would fail, we would end up getting kicked. This lit a fire inside her and she\u2019s done turned us around, I mean, we can\u2019t let this small chick go into a major drug trafficking house alone and not look like a pack of bitch ass pussies.\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned, \u201cwhy does it not surprise me that she\u2019s the leader of your group?\u201d</p><p>Beaudry snickered leaning back in his chair. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m saying here\u2026 she just seemed\u2026. different having you around. She\u2019s not gonna say it, but I can see whatever she said to you is getting to her and it\u2019s not good when she gets distracted.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded and met his gaze, the two staring at each other for a moment.</p><p>***</p><p>Ash didn\u2019t understand herself why she had been more reckless than usual. It was a frustration that seemed to be seething within her. She refused to believe that it started when she had stomped out of the restaurant so long ago. Refused to believe that she missed the stupid phone calls and stupid flowers he sent. </p><p>Who the fuck cared about flowers anyway?</p><p>The equipment had been nice, that damned vest had been long overdue to be replaced. She had used it more than once not that she would ever tell Sean about that, he would kill her if he knew it had been compromised. Shit, she had been on the verge of knitting it back together.</p><p>Hanging her head she replayed her childish tantrum and groaned quietly to herself. He hadn\u2019t deserved that at all. She had always hated seeing him be the one to face all those government officials, always lobbying for the good of his team, she knew what that felt like. Everybody being against you, nobody willing to believe in you or yours, never giving up on the small family unit she had put together\u2026 she growled to herself. They were too much alike anyhow, those things never worked out, work always took most of her time\u2026 not like she was going to apologize, she ran a hand down her face.</p><p>\u201cMoses?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, determination in her green eyes and nodded. She knew that Sean would be beyond angry at her, but honestly the guys had been on her ass for the last month and it was suffocating.</p><p>She could take care of herself. She needed to remind herself of that.</p><p>If she wanted to take on extra shifts with another team she could. She had shouldered her gear and grunted when the Captain congratulated her on trying to move up, work with others that wouldn\u2019t drag her down. It wasn\u2019t that, she just wanted a moment to fucking breathe. </p><p>Just breathe.</p><p>It was odd working with another team, they were not as coordinated as her guys, they seemed to be struggling to keep together but she kept her head low moving through the rooms of the building. </p><p>Another drug den, she couldn\u2019t help but growl in frustration. You would think they had cleared these out. That with the world falling apart into disarray, aliens coming to earth, super beings popping up like mad\u2026 men dressing up in armor\u2026 Ash let out a little sigh, more and more seemed to find comfort in drugs.</p><p>\u201cWhy is there another unit joining ours?\u201d she heard, two men ahead of her turned and stared at her. Fuck. </p><p>\u201cMoses? Clear out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaudry fuck off, we\u2019re almost done here.\u201d She bit back over her comm, she had known, just known it was them. She jutted her chin at the two men in front of her, \u201ckeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoses stand down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegative. Last floor to be cleared,\u201d she answered, rifle held up and against her shoulder as they swept the first room. </p><p>\u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>She could feel her blood boil and tore her earpiece out as Beaudry demanded her to stand down once again. \u201cMother fucker, lets get this done,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The two men nodded and pushed forwards. The second room opened up and led to a number of doors. Ash stepped across the open space, her breath came out slowly, one of the men stepping in front of her as a door opened to their right. </p><p>Ash knew it wasn\u2019t good, knew this was gonna hurt. She shoved her shoulder hard into the man in front of her throwing him down with all her strength, lifting her rifle back up as the crack of gun fire exploded and the room became smaller. It was getting harder to breath under her helmet, she fell to a knee, rolling and taking cover behind a couch.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she growled and replaced her earpiece, grimacing when she heard Beaudry\u2019s voice biting curses at her. \u201cShut up and tell me you\u2019re on the last floor already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we got surprised down here. Handling our own shit, but got a friend headed in for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I don\u2019t have tim-\u201d there was a loud cracking sound, the wall caving in as concrete and bricks exploded into the room. Ash couldn\u2019t help the scream that tore from her lips as she was thrown down, coughing she shoved to her knee\u2019s, rifle back up.</p><p>There in front of her was the Iron Man.</p><p>\u201cMiss me honey?\u201d<br>\u201cUn-fucking-believable,\u201d she uttered under her breath, pulling her helmet off as she looked up at him from her spot on the floor. She sucked in a quick breath as he ran towards her, her arms coming up to defend herself. A small squeak escaping her as he wrapped his arm around her, lifting her off her feet and swinging her around, his body shielding her from the onslaught of bullets. She stared up at him as he raised his free hand, propulsion blast sending men flying back as the two men that had accompanied her scrambled out the door.</p><p>Ash wondered briefly what it was like to dawn the metal suit, how much did it weigh? How many bruises did he accumulate every time he wore it? God he must be exhausted\u2026 Ash didn\u2019t like that she was becoming concerned about him and his well being.</p><p>Tony looked down once the dust settled, she was shoving against him, struggling to get out of his grasp,he ignored her attempts till he saw Sean come through the door, gun raised, and looking very intimidating. He finally allowed her to pull away, \u201cOfficer Beaudry\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sean lowered his weapon, \u201cTony.\u201d <br><br></p><p>****<br></p><p>A/N: Leave me comments??</p><p>Perma

Coffee and sweets every morning, sent her lunch, he gave up when she had a messenger sent and the message was the same as her last words to him.</p><p>He shook his head and offered the man before him a wry smile, &ldquo;to what do I owe the pleasure?&rdquo;</p><p>Sean Beaudry grunted as he sat and glanced around the room quickly, he gave a curt nod, &ldquo;thank you&hellip; for seeing me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the least I can do.&rdquo; He poked around the desk, &ldquo;h-how is Ms. Moses these days? I assume that is why you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p><p>The man shifted in his seat and looked down at his hands before nodding, &ldquo;she would&hellip; would beat me if she found out I came.&rdquo; Tony raised an eyebrow, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s been&hellip; off since her last meeting with you. I think she expected- not sure what she expected really, I don&rsquo;t know what happened between you two either&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, it was an argument,&rdquo; Tony waved a hand, a heavy sigh leaving him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, first off, cause I know Ash hasn&rsquo;t said it, thank you for the equipment. The precinct needed it and it&rsquo;s something everyone is grateful for, state&rsquo;s funds aren&rsquo;t what they used to be. The new vests are amazing and the riot shields? Not to mention the everyday uniforms&hellip;really you went above and beyond.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shook his head, &ldquo;it was nothing really.&rdquo; She had made a point, he had looked into it and found the locals were seriously underfunded. His first purchase had been the vests.</p><p>Beaudry nodded, suppressing a smirk, he knew Ash and he knew she must have hit a nerve with him.&ldquo;Listen, Ash is pretty reckless on any given day, but she&rsquo;s been throwing herself more and more into training. Sticking herself into business that isn&rsquo;t hers and I&rsquo;m not sure what I am really asking here, not even sure what this argument between you two was about. Look,&rdquo; he took in a deep breath and pursed his lips, &ldquo;as long as I&rsquo;ve known Ash she&rsquo;s always been driven to not be distracted from her work. She loves what she does you know? I mean we all do,&rdquo; he shrugged. </p><p>&ldquo;Ash and the rest of us, we were stuck together, the boss told her we would fail, we would end up getting kicked. This lit a fire inside her and she&rsquo;s done turned us around, I mean, we can&rsquo;t let this small chick go into a major drug trafficking house alone and not look like a pack of bitch ass pussies.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grinned, &ldquo;why does it not surprise me that she&rsquo;s the leader of your group?&rdquo;</p><p>Beaudry snickered leaning back in his chair. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m saying here&hellip; she just seemed&hellip;. different having you around. She&rsquo;s not gonna say it, but I can see whatever she said to you is getting to her and it&rsquo;s not good when she gets distracted.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded and met his gaze, the two staring at each other for a moment.</p><p>***</p><p>Ash didn&rsquo;t understand herself why she had been more reckless than usual. It was a frustration that seemed to be seething within her. She refused to believe that it started when she had stomped out of the restaurant so long ago. Refused to believe that she missed the stupid phone calls and stupid flowers he sent. </p><p>Who the fuck cared about flowers anyway?</p><p>The equipment had been nice, that damned vest had been long overdue to be replaced. She had used it more than once not that she would ever tell Sean about that, he would kill her if he knew it had been compromised. Shit, she had been on the verge of knitting it back together.</p><p>Hanging her head she replayed her childish tantrum and groaned quietly to herself. He hadn&rsquo;t deserved that at all. She had always hated seeing him be the one to face all those government officials, always lobbying for the good of his team, she knew what that felt like. Everybody being against you, nobody willing to believe in you or yours, never giving up on the small family unit she had put together&hellip; she growled to herself. They were too much alike anyhow, those things never worked out, work always took most of her time&hellip; not like she was going to apologize, she ran a hand down her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Moses?&rdquo;</p><p>She looked up, determination in her green eyes and nodded. She knew that Sean would be beyond angry at her, but honestly the guys had been on her ass for the last month and it was suffocating.</p><p>She could take care of herself. She needed to remind herself of that.</p><p>If she wanted to take on extra shifts with another team she could. She had shouldered her gear and grunted when the Captain congratulated her on trying to move up, work with others that wouldn&rsquo;t drag her down. It wasn&rsquo;t that, she just wanted a moment to fucking breathe. </p><p>Just breathe.</p><p>It was odd working with another team, they were not as coordinated as her guys, they seemed to be struggling to keep together but she kept her head low moving through the rooms of the building. </p><p>Another drug den, she couldn&rsquo;t help but growl in frustration. You would think they had cleared these out. That with the world falling apart into disarray, aliens coming to earth, super beings popping up like mad&hellip; men dressing up in armor&hellip; Ash let out a little sigh, more and more seemed to find comfort in drugs.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is there another unit joining ours?&rdquo; she heard, two men ahead of her turned and stared at her. Fuck. </p><p>&ldquo;Moses? Clear out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beaudry fuck off, we&rsquo;re almost done here.&rdquo; She bit back over her comm, she had known, just known it was them. She jutted her chin at the two men in front of her, &ldquo;keep going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Moses stand down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Negative. Last floor to be cleared,&rdquo; she answered, rifle held up and against her shoulder as they swept the first room. </p><p>&ldquo;Clear.&rdquo;</p><p>She could feel her blood boil and tore her earpiece out as Beaudry demanded her to stand down once again. &ldquo;Mother fucker, lets get this done,&rdquo; she demanded.</p><p>The two men nodded and pushed forwards. The second room opened up and led to a number of doors. Ash stepped across the open space, her breath came out slowly, one of the men stepping in front of her as a door opened to their right. </p><p>Ash knew it wasn&rsquo;t good, knew this was gonna hurt. She shoved her shoulder hard into the man in front of her throwing him down with all her strength, lifting her rifle back up as the crack of gun fire exploded and the room became smaller. It was getting harder to breath under her helmet, she fell to a knee, rolling and taking cover behind a couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; she growled and replaced her earpiece, grimacing when she heard Beaudry&rsquo;s voice biting curses at her. &ldquo;Shut up and tell me you&rsquo;re on the last floor already?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, we got surprised down here. Handling our own shit, but got a friend headed in for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sean, I don&rsquo;t have tim-&rdquo; there was a loud cracking sound, the wall caving in as concrete and bricks exploded into the room. Ash couldn&rsquo;t help the scream that tore from her lips as she was thrown down, coughing she shoved to her knee&rsquo;s, rifle back up.</p><p>There in front of her was the Iron Man.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss me honey?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Un-fucking-believable,&rdquo; she uttered under her breath, pulling her helmet off as she looked up at him from her spot on the floor. She sucked in a quick breath as he ran towards her, her arms coming up to defend herself. A small squeak escaping her as he wrapped his arm around her, lifting her off her feet and swinging her around, his body shielding her from the onslaught of bullets. She stared up at him as he raised his free hand, propulsion blast sending men flying back as the two men that had accompanied her scrambled out the door.</p><p>Ash wondered briefly what it was like to dawn the metal suit, how much did it weigh? How many bruises did he accumulate every time he wore it? God he must be exhausted&hellip; Ash didn&rsquo;t like that she was becoming concerned about him and his well being.</p><p>Tony looked down once the dust settled, she was shoving against him, struggling to get out of his grasp,he ignored her attempts till he saw Sean come through the door, gun raised, and looking very intimidating. He finally allowed her to pull away, &ldquo;Officer Beaudry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Sean lowered his weapon, &ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; <br /><br /></p><p>****<br /></p><p>A/N: Leave me comments??</p><p>Perma
