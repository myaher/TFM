If you could sigh, you would - you\u2019re covered in his hair again, and you\u2019d just cleaned off your work clothes. He\u2019s never usually this clingy, but your hybrid is as unpredictable as you would expect,</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cGet off of me, you overgrown house cat,\u201d You grunt, tugging at Taehyung\u2019s striped tail. He yelps in response and jumps down, growling at you from low in his throat. When you first got him, you\u2019d been terrified of this kind of thing. He goes down into a crouch and bares his teeth as he growls, tail swishing behind him in a menacing display, but he doesn\u2019t mean any harm. He\u2019s scared of the bath, what\u2019s your tiny little tiger cub going to do? Kiss you to death?</p><p>\u201c\u2019M not a house cat,\u201d Taehyung whines, standing up after you pat his ears messily before walking away to continue getting ready. He\u2019s been getting more and more needy lately, and after your two-week holiday he\u2019s reluctant to let you go back to work. When you tease him by squishing his cheeks and asking what he is if not that, he stomps his foot and replies, \u201cTiger! I\u2019ll stop you from going. I\u2019ll tear up your apartment and curl up in your lap until you give up,\u201d Taehyung continues to protest while you sit down to do your hair, reaching for your lint roller. Occupational hazard of owning a tiger hybrid - they shed fur too, but there\u2019s more of it,</p><p>\u201cYou seem like a house cat to me. A pouty one,\u201d You reply, chuckling to yourself when Taehyung whines again, sitting in the seat next to you at your dressing table as he noses your arm. He\u2019s sweet and a great companion, and it\u2019s damn lucky his protective and territorial instinct come out to diluted and soft,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like how your clothes smell. They don\u2019t smell like me,\u201d Taehyung further protests, and his ears tickle your face as he moves around. You reach up a hand to scratch behind them, smiling when he immediately starts purring, his head collapsing into your lap. Normal cat hybrids purr softly, barely audible. Taehyung\u2019s different though, and this is why you call him an overgrown house cat. He\u2019s similar to other cat hybrids, but his tiger DNA presents in stronger emotions, stronger physical strength, a longer tail and louder purrs. It shakes his chest and vibrates against you as he nudges up into your loving touch,</p><p>\u201cI know, Tae. I\u2019ll only be gone for a little while, and then we can have dinner together. Why don\u2019t you go and hunt some things down so I can whip up our favourite meal?\u201d You ask gently. For all your teasing and his feeble protests, you know this is difficult for him. Taehyung has abandonment issues, and even tough he knows you\u2019re coming back he\u2019s still scared. You understand. But at the sound of hunting (hopefully in the supermarket, since the first time you teased with that term he came back with a dead pigeon) Taehyung perks up, looking up at you with wide and excited eyes,</p><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll go and get food for my loving mate while you take care of the cubs,\u201d Taehyung confirms, bouncing up with a new sense of purpose. You snort to yourself as you brush the few tiger hairs off of you,</p><p>\u201cI am not your mate, and the only cub here is you,\u201d You fire back, but Taehyung\u2019s not listening. His tail is curled around his thigh as he fiddles around with his shoelaces (he only recently learned how to tie them by himself) and mumbles to himself, likely compiling a list of things you need. With a fond smile, you place a kiss between his twitching tiger ears, \u201cThere\u2019s a pad of paper in the kitchen if you need to write some things down. Don\u2019t forget to lock up with your key before you leave, and be careful, little cub,\u201d You say to him, unsure if he took all of it in but not really minding.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s too busy thinking of how happy you\u2019ll be when he does the shopping all on his own, and did his shoelaces by himself too to realise when you creep out of the door.</p><p><a href=\"https://taehyungiejiminie95.tumblr.com/post/164938184180/the-masterlist\">Masterlist</a></p>",

If you could sigh, you would - you\u2019re covered in his hair again, and you\u2019d just cleaned off your work clothes. He\u2019s never usually this clingy, but your hybrid is as unpredictable as you would expect,</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cGet off of me, you overgrown house cat,\u201d You grunt, tugging at Taehyung\u2019s striped tail. He yelps in response and jumps down, growling at you from low in his throat. When you first got him, you\u2019d been terrified of this kind of thing. He goes down into a crouch and bares his teeth as he growls, tail swishing behind him in a menacing display, but he doesn\u2019t mean any harm. He\u2019s scared of the bath, what\u2019s your tiny little tiger cub going to do? Kiss you to death?</p><p>\u201c\u2019M not a house cat,\u201d Taehyung whines, standing up after you pat his ears messily before walking away to continue getting ready. He\u2019s been getting more and more needy lately, and after your two-week holiday he\u2019s reluctant to let you go back to work. When you tease him by squishing his cheeks and asking what he is if not that, he stomps his foot and replies, \u201cTiger! I\u2019ll stop you from going. I\u2019ll tear up your apartment and curl up in your lap until you give up,\u201d Taehyung continues to protest while you sit down to do your hair, reaching for your lint roller. Occupational hazard of owning a tiger hybrid - they shed fur too, but there\u2019s more of it,</p><p>\u201cYou seem like a house cat to me. A pouty one,\u201d You reply, chuckling to yourself when Taehyung whines again, sitting in the seat next to you at your dressing table as he noses your arm. He\u2019s sweet and a great companion, and it\u2019s damn lucky his protective and territorial instinct come out to diluted and soft,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like how your clothes smell. They don\u2019t smell like me,\u201d Taehyung further protests, and his ears tickle your face as he moves around. You reach up a hand to scratch behind them, smiling when he immediately starts purring, his head collapsing into your lap. Normal cat hybrids purr softly, barely audible. Taehyung\u2019s different though, and this is why you call him an overgrown house cat. He\u2019s similar to other cat hybrids, but his tiger DNA presents in stronger emotions, stronger physical strength, a longer tail and louder purrs. It shakes his chest and vibrates against you as he nudges up into your loving touch,</p><p>\u201cI know, Tae. I\u2019ll only be gone for a little while, and then we can have dinner together. Why don\u2019t you go and hunt some things down so I can whip up our favourite meal?\u201d You ask gently. For all your teasing and his feeble protests, you know this is difficult for him. Taehyung has abandonment issues, and even tough he knows you\u2019re coming back he\u2019s still scared. You understand. But at the sound of hunting (hopefully in the supermarket, since the first time you teased with that term he came back with a dead pigeon) Taehyung perks up, looking up at you with wide and excited eyes,</p><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll go and get food for my loving mate while you take care of the cubs,\u201d Taehyung confirms, bouncing up with a new sense of purpose. You snort to yourself as you brush the few tiger hairs off of you,</p><p>\u201cI am not your mate, and the only cub here is you,\u201d You fire back, but Taehyung\u2019s not listening. His tail is curled around his thigh as he fiddles around with his shoelaces (he only recently learned how to tie them by himself) and mumbles to himself, likely compiling a list of things you need. With a fond smile, you place a kiss between his twitching tiger ears, \u201cThere\u2019s a pad of paper in the kitchen if you need to write some things down. Don\u2019t forget to lock up with your key before you leave, and be careful, little cub,\u201d You say to him, unsure if he took all of it in but not really minding.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s too busy thinking of how happy you\u2019ll be when he does the shopping all on his own, and did his shoelaces by himself too to realise when you creep out of the door.</p><p><a href=\"https://taehyungiejiminie95.tumblr.com/post/164938184180/the-masterlist\">Masterlist</a></p></p>",

My brother is seven years younger then me but, he&rsquo;s still the golden child. That meaning if there was ever something wrong with him it was always &lsquo;oh my poor baby&rsquo; or 'what&rsquo;s wrong my love&rsquo;. If it was me it was like I wasn&rsquo;t even there. I was invisible to my whole family. And if I were to ever say anything about I how I was feeling it would always be 'what are you crying for, you have nothing to cry about&rsquo; or they would scoff and then just leave it at that. So naturally I dealt with everything on my own. The only thing I had to turn to was music. I self taught myself to play the piano but, I couldn&rsquo;t do that because 'shut up it&rsquo;s annoying&rsquo; so I just play when they&rsquo;re all at my brothers soccer games or just listen to music. </p><p>I met Jungkook through school. He&rsquo;s my best friend and he introduced me to all of his hyungs. There&rsquo;s Soekjin, Youngi, Hosoek, Namjoon, Jimin, and Taehyung. They&rsquo;re all really nice and, I enjoy being around all of them as much as I can. We&rsquo;ve all grown really close but, Jungkook is still the only one who knows my living situation so he lets me stay at their dorm all the time. Of course my parents don&rsquo;t care, hell they probably don&rsquo;t notice I&rsquo;m not around anyway. They even let me bring my keyboard so I can play whenever I want and even sing with them. </p><p>Some nights, though I rather not, I do go home. Like tonight, I&rsquo;m going home because they&rsquo;re all boys and even though they&rsquo;ve told me multiple times that it&rsquo;s really okay for me to stay, I still want them to have time just being boys with each other. It&rsquo;s been four days since the last time I was home and when I got here I didn&rsquo;t know what I was going to walk into. Let me just say that I was wrong to think that no one saw that I was gone all the time. He wasn&rsquo;t happy about it either so he followed me one day and found out where I was going and that it was a house full of boys. Him being my younger brother told my parents so when I got home that night they started yelling at me. Telling me how I&rsquo;m a disgrace to the family and that the next time I leave to not bother coming back because they can&rsquo;t bare to look me in my face because of how disgusting I was. So I went to my room, packed a bag and, left. I didn&rsquo;t want to go to Jungkook because one, he and all the boys were probably already asleep; two, I didn&rsquo;t want them to see me crying and; three, I&rsquo;m already a burden to my family so why would I ever want to become a burden to them. So I just walked, I didn&rsquo;t know where I was going I just let my feet carry me until I was at the park. I went and sat on a swing so I could think about what I&rsquo;m going to do. Before long I could feel myself dozing off. </p><p>~~Jimins pov~~</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t get myself to fall asleep so I thought if I take a little walk I&rsquo;ll tire myself out so that when I get back I can fall asleep just fine. I walked to the park, it wasn&rsquo;t to far from the house and, I want to swing. I always loved to swing when I was little so I wanted to revisit those memories. As I walked through the entrance of the park I could see a girl already sitting on one of the swings. I couldn&rsquo;t make out who she was at first because it&rsquo;s dark outside but, as I got closer I saw that it was Ros\u00e9. She also looked like she was about to fall off the swing as if she had fallen asleep there. I didn&rsquo;t want her to fall and get hurt so I ran and caught her before she fell. This caused her to wake up and when she saw it was me she looked relieved. </p><p>&ldquo;Ros\u00e9, what are you doing here this late at night&rdquo; I saw her backpack on the ground next to her, &ldquo;why do you have a bag with you? Is everything alright?&rdquo;  I was starting to worry for her, she&rsquo;s like my little sister, I don&rsquo;t want her out here this late and it seems like she doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere to go. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to our dorm Ros\u00e9?&rdquo; Her head was hung low like she was embarrassed. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting what came next, I&rsquo;ve never seen her blow up like this.</p><p>~~Ros\u00e9s pov~~ </p><p>&ldquo;Stop asking me all these questions Jimin! I know I&rsquo;m stupid alright! You don&rsquo;t have to make me feel any worse then I already do!&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t mean to blow up on him like that but, I was frustrated and overwhelmed that it all just came out that way. When I realized what I had done I looked up at him and he looked even more shocked then I was with myself. This made me me feel really bad so I apologized.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, just it&rsquo;s been a rough night and, I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I wanted to call Jungkook but, I didn&rsquo;t want to bother any of you because I had just left. To put it in short I&rsquo;ve got no where to go. So I came here to try and figure something out but, I guess I was falling asleep, thanks for catching me by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome&rdquo; then let me continue.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just frustrated and angry and sad and tired, that&rsquo;s why I just yelled at you. It wasn&rsquo;t right of me to do that so I&rsquo;m sorry Jimin.&rdquo; I bowed my head again because I didn&rsquo;t want him to see me trying to hold in my tears. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Res\u00e9 but, you should have just called Jungkook. Or any of us for that matter. You&rsquo;re our little sister and, the last thing we want is for you to be out here this late, with a bag and, no where to go. Jungkook worries about you a lot. I know because he tells us. Never anything personal but, he always says things like 'I hope Ros\u00e9 is okay&rsquo;.&rdquo; This made me feel worse because I didn&rsquo;t want to be that person for Jungkook, I just want him and all the boys to be happy. &ldquo;Remember this Ros\u00e9, you&rsquo;ll always have us, even when you don&rsquo;t want our help we will always be right there ready to help you. So if something ever happens to you again please call one of us okay?&rdquo; I looked up at him and nodded because if I were to talk right now I would cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, come on.&rdquo; He picks up my bag for me and starts walking off. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; After I said it I felt dumb.</p><p>&ldquo;To our dorm.&rdquo; He laughed a little and that made me laugh. </p><p>So we walked to the dorm, I guess somewhere along the way Jimin texted the other boys so when we got there they were all waiting in the lounge room for us. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what Jimin told them but, when Tae came up to me and hugged me I knew that they all kind of new what happened. When he pulled away he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to have our little Ros\u00e9 here with us all the time now.&rdquo; I smiled and he patted my head. And that&rsquo;s how they all welcomed me in. All except for Jungkook. When he came up to me he grabbed my wrist and dragged me to his room after he glared at Jimin. Whats wrong with him right now. </p><p>~~Jungkooks pov~~</p><p>Why didn&rsquo;t she call me. I&rsquo;m her best friend. I care about her the most. She&rsquo;s mine. Why did Jimin hyung have to go be 'Prince Charming&rsquo; oh right because she didn&rsquo;t call me! She tells me everything and I tell her everything. All of our troubles, what makes us happy, everything. SO WHY DIDN&rsquo;T SHE CALL ME. It made me mad so I took her to my room to talk to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook you&rsquo;re hurting me! Stop!&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t realize I was holding her that tight so when she ripped her wrist from my hold and, looked angrily at me I tried to calm myself down a little. But I was still mad at her. &ldquo;What is wrong with\u2014&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t let her finish.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you call me Ros\u00e9! Did you think I wouldn&rsquo;t have helped you!&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t say anything. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my best friend Ros\u00e9. You&rsquo;ve told me everything. About your family and the piano, everything so why didn&rsquo;t you call me?! Why did you let it go far enough for Jimin to just find you in the park?! Huh? Someone could have hurt you Ros\u00e9 and then what? I don&rsquo;t know what I would do if I lost you.&rdquo; I ran my finger through my hair in frustration. &ldquo;I like you and this is how you treat me? By letting Jimin save you instead of me. I care for you the most!&rdquo; When I looked at her I realized what I just said and started to panic. Why are you so stupid Jungkook if you had just calmed yourself down none of this would have happened. </p><p>~~Ros\u00e9s pov~~ </p><p>What? Did he just say that? Is it true? He&rsquo;s just rambling now maybe I should stop him but, it&rsquo;s kind of funny. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, I don&rsquo;t, well I do but, it&rsquo;s fine if you don&rsquo;t, I understand cuz, friends and yeah so, uhm sorry I think, but I wanted to say it for a while, but not like this and yeah sorry.&rdquo; He scratched the back of his neck. &ldquo;Ros\u00e9 I\u2014&rdquo; I hugged him. </p><p>&ldquo;I like you too Jungkook.&rdquo; I looked up at him and he was smiling and his cheeks were red. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry okay. I know I should have called you first. I wanted to but, I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb you if you were sleeping and I didn&rsquo;t want to become a burden to you or the boys. I just want all of you to be happy. Especially you. You matter the most to me, you&rsquo;re my best friend and I like you a lot.&rdquo; I hugged him a little tighter. &ldquo;My brother found out that I was coming here most of the time that I wasn&rsquo;t home. It made him mad and even more mad when he realized I was staying here for days at a time. So he told our parents and when I got home earlier they called me disgusting and told me not to come back. I didn&rsquo;t want to be a hassle for anyone. That&rsquo;s why didn&rsquo;t call you. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He unwrapped my arms from around him and cupped my face with his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;You will never be a burden to any of us Ros\u00e9. Especially not to me okay. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to call on me or any of the boys but, mostly me. You&rsquo;re mine and none of them can have you, especially Jimin.&rdquo; Him saying that made me smile and he rubbed his thumbs on my cheeks. &ldquo;I will always be her for you Ros\u00e9, no matter what.&rdquo; Then he leaned in and kissed me. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it so when he did it I was caught off guard a little. But I melted under his kiss and soon enough was kissing him back. We both pulled away and my cheeks were probably bright red. </p><p>&ldquo;We should probably go back out there so I can explain what happened to the others. They deserve to know.&rdquo; I turn to go out the door but, before I could twist the nob he grabs me back and hugs me again. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I just wanted to hug you again before we go.&rdquo; We both laughed and, I opened to door to have Jimin and Tae fall into the room while Youngj and Hoseok ran away and Namjoon and Soekjin just stood there looking at us. I was surprised to say the least. </p><p>&ldquo;Hyungs! Were you guys eavesdropping on us?&rdquo; When they didn&rsquo;t say anything but smirk Jungkook ran after them. While I was laughing so hard my stomach started hurting. I&rsquo;m happy that me and Jungkook finally cunfessed to each other and I couldn&rsquo;t wait for the adventures I would have with the boys in the future. When Jimin got up I jumped on his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s gooo Jiminnie!&rdquo; And we both laughed as he ran with me on his back. </p><p>&ldquo;Jimin hyung put her down now!&rdquo; This made me laugh even more. That&rsquo;s how the rest of the night went until we were all tired and fell asleep in the lounge room.</p>",

My brother is seven years younger then me but, he\u2019s still the golden child. That meaning if there was ever something wrong with him it was always \u2018oh my poor baby\u2019 or 'what\u2019s wrong my love\u2019. If it was me it was like I wasn\u2019t even there. I was invisible to my whole family. And if I were to ever say anything about I how I was feeling it would always be 'what are you crying for, you have nothing to cry about\u2019 or they would scoff and then just leave it at that. So naturally I dealt with everything on my own. The only thing I had to turn to was music. I self taught myself to play the piano but, I couldn\u2019t do that because 'shut up it\u2019s annoying\u2019 so I just play when they\u2019re all at my brothers soccer games or just listen to music. </p><p>I met Jungkook through school. He\u2019s my best friend and he introduced me to all of his hyungs. There\u2019s Soekjin, Youngi, Hosoek, Namjoon, Jimin, and Taehyung. They\u2019re all really nice and, I enjoy being around all of them as much as I can. We\u2019ve all grown really close but, Jungkook is still the only one who knows my living situation so he lets me stay at their dorm all the time. Of course my parents don\u2019t care, hell they probably don\u2019t notice I\u2019m not around anyway. They even let me bring my keyboard so I can play whenever I want and even sing with them. </p><p>Some nights, though I rather not, I do go home. Like tonight, I\u2019m going home because they\u2019re all boys and even though they\u2019ve told me multiple times that it\u2019s really okay for me to stay, I still want them to have time just being boys with each other. It\u2019s been four days since the last time I was home and when I got here I didn\u2019t know what I was going to walk into. Let me just say that I was wrong to think that no one saw that I was gone all the time. He wasn\u2019t happy about it either so he followed me one day and found out where I was going and that it was a house full of boys. Him being my younger brother told my parents so when I got home that night they started yelling at me. Telling me how I\u2019m a disgrace to the family and that the next time I leave to not bother coming back because they can\u2019t bare to look me in my face because of how disgusting I was. So I went to my room, packed a bag and, left. I didn\u2019t want to go to Jungkook because one, he and all the boys were probably already asleep; two, I didn\u2019t want them to see me crying and; three, I\u2019m already a burden to my family so why would I ever want to become a burden to them. So I just walked, I didn\u2019t know where I was going I just let my feet carry me until I was at the park. I went and sat on a swing so I could think about what I\u2019m going to do. Before long I could feel myself dozing off. </p><p>~~Jimins pov~~</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get myself to fall asleep so I thought if I take a little walk I\u2019ll tire myself out so that when I get back I can fall asleep just fine. I walked to the park, it wasn\u2019t to far from the house and, I want to swing. I always loved to swing when I was little so I wanted to revisit those memories. As I walked through the entrance of the park I could see a girl already sitting on one of the swings. I couldn\u2019t make out who she was at first because it\u2019s dark outside but, as I got closer I saw that it was Ros\u00e9. She also looked like she was about to fall off the swing as if she had fallen asleep there. I didn\u2019t want her to fall and get hurt so I ran and caught her before she fell. This caused her to wake up and when she saw it was me she looked relieved. </p><p>\u201cRos\u00e9, what are you doing here this late at night\u201d I saw her backpack on the ground next to her, \u201cwhy do you have a bag with you? Is everything alright?\u201d  I was starting to worry for her, she\u2019s like my little sister, I don\u2019t want her out here this late and it seems like she doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to our dorm Ros\u00e9?\u201d Her head was hung low like she was embarrassed. I wasn\u2019t expecting what came next, I\u2019ve never seen her blow up like this.</p><p>~~Ros\u00e9s pov~~ </p><p>\u201cStop asking me all these questions Jimin! I know I\u2019m stupid alright! You don\u2019t have to make me feel any worse then I already do!\u201d I didn\u2019t mean to blow up on him like that but, I was frustrated and overwhelmed that it all just came out that way. When I realized what I had done I looked up at him and he looked even more shocked then I was with myself. This made me me feel really bad so I apologized.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, just it\u2019s been a rough night and, I don\u2019t know what to do. I wanted to call Jungkook but, I didn\u2019t want to bother any of you because I had just left. To put it in short I\u2019ve got no where to go. So I came here to try and figure something out but, I guess I was falling asleep, thanks for catching me by the way.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d then let me continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated and angry and sad and tired, that\u2019s why I just yelled at you. It wasn\u2019t right of me to do that so I\u2019m sorry Jimin.\u201d I bowed my head again because I didn\u2019t want him to see me trying to hold in my tears. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Res\u00e9 but, you should have just called Jungkook. Or any of us for that matter. You\u2019re our little sister and, the last thing we want is for you to be out here this late, with a bag and, no where to go. Jungkook worries about you a lot. I know because he tells us. Never anything personal but, he always says things like 'I hope Ros\u00e9 is okay\u2019.\u201d This made me feel worse because I didn\u2019t want to be that person for Jungkook, I just want him and all the boys to be happy. \u201cRemember this Ros\u00e9, you\u2019ll always have us, even when you don\u2019t want our help we will always be right there ready to help you. So if something ever happens to you again please call one of us okay?\u201d I looked up at him and nodded because if I were to talk right now I would cry.</p><p>\u201cAlright, come on.\u201d He picks up my bag for me and starts walking off. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d After I said it I felt dumb.</p><p>\u201cTo our dorm.\u201d He laughed a little and that made me laugh. </p><p>So we walked to the dorm, I guess somewhere along the way Jimin texted the other boys so when we got there they were all waiting in the lounge room for us. I wasn\u2019t sure what Jimin told them but, when Tae came up to me and hugged me I knew that they all kind of new what happened. When he pulled away he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited to have our little Ros\u00e9 here with us all the time now.\u201d I smiled and he patted my head. And that\u2019s how they all welcomed me in. All except for Jungkook. When he came up to me he grabbed my wrist and dragged me to his room after he glared at Jimin. Whats wrong with him right now. </p><p>~~Jungkooks pov~~</p><p>Why didn\u2019t she call me. I\u2019m her best friend. I care about her the most. She\u2019s mine. Why did Jimin hyung have to go be 'Prince Charming\u2019 oh right because she didn\u2019t call me! She tells me everything and I tell her everything. All of our troubles, what makes us happy, everything. SO WHY DIDN\u2019T SHE CALL ME. It made me mad so I took her to my room to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cJungkook you\u2019re hurting me! Stop!\u201d I didn\u2019t realize I was holding her that tight so when she ripped her wrist from my hold and, looked angrily at me I tried to calm myself down a little. But I was still mad at her. \u201cWhat is wrong with\u2014\u201d I didn\u2019t let her finish.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me Ros\u00e9! Did you think I wouldn\u2019t have helped you!\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend Ros\u00e9. You\u2019ve told me everything. About your family and the piano, everything so why didn\u2019t you call me?! Why did you let it go far enough for Jimin to just find you in the park?! Huh? Someone could have hurt you Ros\u00e9 and then what? I don\u2019t know what I would do if I lost you.\u201d I ran my finger through my hair in frustration. \u201cI like you and this is how you treat me? By letting Jimin save you instead of me. I care for you the most!\u201d When I looked at her I realized what I just said and started to panic. Why are you so stupid Jungkook if you had just calmed yourself down none of this would have happened. </p><p>~~Ros\u00e9s pov~~ </p><p>What? Did he just say that? Is it true? He\u2019s just rambling now maybe I should stop him but, it\u2019s kind of funny. </p><p>\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t, well I do but, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t, I understand cuz, friends and yeah so, uhm sorry I think, but I wanted to say it for a while, but not like this and yeah sorry.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cRos\u00e9 I\u2014\u201d I hugged him. </p><p>\u201cI like you too Jungkook.\u201d I looked up at him and he was smiling and his cheeks were red. \u201cI\u2019m sorry okay. I know I should have called you first. I wanted to but, I didn\u2019t want to disturb you if you were sleeping and I didn\u2019t want to become a burden to you or the boys. I just want all of you to be happy. Especially you. You matter the most to me, you\u2019re my best friend and I like you a lot.\u201d I hugged him a little tighter. \u201cMy brother found out that I was coming here most of the time that I wasn\u2019t home. It made him mad and even more mad when he realized I was staying here for days at a time. So he told our parents and when I got home earlier they called me disgusting and told me not to come back. I didn\u2019t want to be a hassle for anyone. That\u2019s why didn\u2019t call you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He unwrapped my arms from around him and cupped my face with his hands. </p><p>\u201cYou will never be a burden to any of us Ros\u00e9. Especially not to me okay. So don\u2019t be afraid to call on me or any of the boys but, mostly me. You\u2019re mine and none of them can have you, especially Jimin.\u201d Him saying that made me smile and he rubbed his thumbs on my cheeks. \u201cI will always be her for you Ros\u00e9, no matter what.\u201d Then he leaned in and kissed me. I wasn\u2019t expecting it so when he did it I was caught off guard a little. But I melted under his kiss and soon enough was kissing him back. We both pulled away and my cheeks were probably bright red. </p><p>\u201cWe should probably go back out there so I can explain what happened to the others. They deserve to know.\u201d I turn to go out the door but, before I could twist the nob he grabs me back and hugs me again. </p><p>\u201cSorry, I just wanted to hug you again before we go.\u201d We both laughed and, I opened to door to have Jimin and Tae fall into the room while Youngj and Hoseok ran away and Namjoon and Soekjin just stood there looking at us. I was surprised to say the least. </p><p>\u201cHyungs! Were you guys eavesdropping on us?\u201d When they didn\u2019t say anything but smirk Jungkook ran after them. While I was laughing so hard my stomach started hurting. I\u2019m happy that me and Jungkook finally cunfessed to each other and I couldn\u2019t wait for the adventures I would have with the boys in the future. When Jimin got up I jumped on his back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s gooo Jiminnie!\u201d And we both laughed as he ran with me on his back. </p><p>\u201cJimin hyung put her down now!\u201d This made me laugh even more. That\u2019s how the rest of the night went until we were all tired and fell asleep in the lounge room.</p></p>",

You&rsquo;re mine and none of them can have you, especially Jimin.&rdquo; Him saying that made me smile and he rubbed his thumbs on my cheeks. &ldquo;I will always be her for you Ros&eacute;, no matter what.&rdquo; Then he leaned in and kissed me. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it so when he did it I was caught off guard a little. But I melted under his kiss and soon enough was kissing him back. We both pulled away and my cheeks were probably bright red. </p><p>&ldquo;We should probably go back out there so I can explain what happened to the others. They deserve to know.&rdquo; I turn to go out the door but, before I could twist the nob he grabs me back and hugs me again. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I just wanted to hug you again before we go.&rdquo; We both laughed and, I opened to door to have Jimin and Tae fall into the room while Youngj and Hoseok ran away and Namjoon and Soekjin just stood there looking at us. I was surprised to say the least. </p><p>&ldquo;Hyungs! Were you guys eavesdropping on us?&rdquo; When they didn&rsquo;t say anything but smirk Jungkook ran after them. While I was laughing so hard my stomach started hurting. I&rsquo;m happy that me and Jungkook finally cunfessed to each other and I couldn&rsquo;t wait for the adventures I would have with the boys in the future. When Jimin got up I jumped on his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s gooo Jiminnie!&rdquo; And we both laughed as he ran with me on his back. </p><p>&ldquo;Jimin hyung put her down now!&rdquo; This made me laugh even more. That&rsquo;s how the rest of the night went until we were all tired and fell asleep in the lounge room.</p></p>",
