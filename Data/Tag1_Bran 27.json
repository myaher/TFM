He brings up Sansa&rsquo;s traumatic memories which is pretty shitty and I&rsquo;d be a bit afraid of him at that point. He&rsquo;s not comforting to be around and he has no interest in any truly human affairs. He&rsquo;s not going to be sticking around to be Lord of Winterfell. Being around him is lonely and only reminds his siblings of the brother they have lost. </p><p>But Jon. Jon was King in the North. Jon loves the North. Jon never wants to leave the North. Winterfell is his home. It&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;s always wanted to live. He&rsquo;s always wanted to be a Stark. And now that Sansa shares all the same sentiments of valuing her Starkness and never wanting to leave the North and Winterfell, they have such common goals for their futures. She can rule with Jon. And I think that&rsquo;s her dream of the future: an independent North ruled by her and Jon. She never expects Jon to want to leave or to not end up in Winterfell with her at the end of this. And it&rsquo;s telling that she&rsquo;s okay sharing that power&hellip; especially even after all he&rsquo;s done to undermine Northern independence - she still wants him back home. </p><p>Jon being with another woman, especially a Southerner and especially someone who wants to subjugate the North, crushes that dream Initially though. It&rsquo;s not something she was expecting out of him. Even if she doesn&rsquo;t want him romantically (which I think she does), his new queen takes up a place in his life that boxes her out. </p><p>It&rsquo;s telling to me that in Sansas goodbye she says &ldquo;they lost their king&rdquo; because honestly they lost him a long time ago. When Jon bent the knee they lost him. When the Northern lords who made Jon king wanted to unmake him, they lost him. He gave up his crown, and yet Sansa was always trying to get it back to him. She always trying to fix his mistakes and get power back into his hands, and get him back to Winterfell. She still always wanted Jon to be King and her to be Lady of Winterfell and for them to rule together basically like they had before he went South. </p>",

I am very sorry for the late reply. </p><p>So moving on to your question about Bran&rsquo;s endgame in the books. I do think that he will end up as a king. In fact ruling Winterfell is something that&rsquo;s heavily foreshadowed in Bran&rsquo;s storyline. From as early as AGoT we see Bran claiming to feel like a lord of the castle: </p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well.<b> It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.</b></p><p>In ACoK we see him presiding over the harvest feast and learning the simple nuances of politics. I also think that out of all the siblings Bran is the one who is most connected to this ancient seat of House Stark.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>&hellip;Beyond, the tops of the keeps and towers still stood as they had for hundreds of years, and it was hard to tell that the castle had been sacked and burned at all. The stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained<b>. It was not dead, just\u00a0broken.\u00a0Like\u00a0me, he thought. I&rsquo;m not dead either. </b></p><p>The fact that he compares himself to Winterfell is very telling in itself. So how can Bran then end the series by moving away from Winterfell, the place from where he draws his strength? It wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense if George just plucks him out of the North to plop him down in Kingslanding, a place that once represented Bran&rsquo;s dreams of being a knight. </p><p>Now as for Arya. I would be really disappointed if George makes her sail off to some unknown land after focusing so much on the importance of her family and the North in her povs. Take this excerpt for example:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>If only she could climb like Bran, she thought; she would go out the window and down the tower, run away from this horrible place, away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of them.

She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, <b>and together they&rsquo;d return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on the Wall.</b></p><p>This is just after Mycah&rsquo;s death and Arya feels miserable in the Red Keep. And what does she think of doing? Arya wants to run away to Winterfell or to Jon at the Wall.

So how is Arya returning home and staying with her family not the story that Grrm is writing? What is the point of all these if by the end of it all, Arya just sails away to the West of Westeros?

I am not saying that I am right and you are wrong. To be completely honest I am just speculating. I really feel that the way the story is going, Arya will only agree to leave the North (again!) if it means that she can be with a loved one or with someone who feels like home to her. </p><p>Also I think I made a mistake by saying that the story was moving on the &ldquo;right track&rdquo;. D&amp;d&rsquo;s was always a fanfiction (with some sprinkles of truth). It had diverged too much to not to be. What I was trying to point out is the inconsistency of it all. If the story is really going to end like this in the books, then whose expectation did D&amp;d subvert? I once read a very articulate post here about how D&amp;d&rsquo;s ending was a cheap, basterised version of Grrm&rsquo;s ending. And I agree. Maybe it won&rsquo;t end the way we want it to, but it sure as hell is not going to be the lazy and tacky ending that D&amp;d gave us.</p>",

I am very sorry for the late reply. </p><p>So moving on to your question about Bran\u2019s endgame in the books. I do think that he will end up as a king. In fact ruling Winterfell is something that\u2019s heavily foreshadowed in Bran\u2019s storyline. From as early as AGoT we see Bran claiming to feel like a lord of the castle: </p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well.<b> It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.</b></p><p>In ACoK we see him presiding over the harvest feast and learning the simple nuances of politics. I also think that out of all the siblings Bran is the one who is most connected to this ancient seat of House Stark.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u2026Beyond, the tops of the keeps and towers still stood as they had for hundreds of years, and it was hard to tell that the castle had been sacked and burned at all. The stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained<b>. It was not dead, just\u00a0broken.\u00a0Like\u00a0me, he thought. I\u2019m not dead either. </b></p><p>The fact that he compares himself to Winterfell is very telling in itself. So how can Bran then end the series by moving away from Winterfell, the place from where he draws his strength? It wouldn\u2019t make any sense if George just plucks him out of the North to plop him down in Kingslanding, a place that once represented Bran\u2019s dreams of being a knight. </p><p>Now as for Arya. I would be really disappointed if George makes her sail off to some unknown land after focusing so much on the importance of her family and the North in her povs. Take this excerpt for example:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>If only she could climb like Bran, she thought; she would go out the window and down the tower, run away from this horrible place, away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of them. Steal some food from the kitchens, take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak. She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, <b>and together they\u2019d return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on the Wall.</b></p><p>This is just after Mycah\u2019s death and Arya feels miserable in the Red Keep. And what does she think of doing? Arya wants to run away to Winterfell or to Jon at the Wall. So even before she loses everything, Arya longs to return home. </p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u2026but Yoren at least must have a grave, Arya had insisted. <b>He was going to bring me safe to Winterfell, he promised. </b>Part of her wanted to cry.

So how is Arya returning home and staying with her family not the story that Grrm is writing? What is the point of all these if by the end of it all, Arya just sails away to the West of Westeros?
