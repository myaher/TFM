I obsess so you\u2019ll notice my blog going through phases. The current phase is Critical Role. Vax and Vex are my smol trash children and Gilmore literally gives me life. \nI also love Shadowhunters, the Marvel Universe in all its incarnations, various poorly known TV shows and web series that deserve far more fans than they have, and a lot of YouTubers. I will post feminist things. I will post \u2018social justice\u2019 things. I will talk about myself. I will bitch about work (I have a tag for it).\nI\u2019m bisexual. I like queer representation, which is how you can convince me to watch pretty much anything. I\u2019m a graduate. I write. Tumblr is my happy place and my life\u2019s blood and now I have internet access on my phone I am here pretty much all the time. I don\u2019t bite, so feel free to say hi.",
