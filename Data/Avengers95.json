        "answer": "<p>SO CUTE, I hope you like this! &lt;3</p><p>___________________________________</p><p>You grimaced as your bare feet touched the wooden floors when you got out of bed. It was a bitter cold day in December and all you wanted was a warm cup of hot chocolate to jumpstart your day. </p><p>Pattering your way to the living room in your robe, you heard the familiar sounds of Assassin\u2019s Creed coming from the TV. JARVIS had turned on the heat and you enjoyed the warm blast of air hit your face as you entered the room. </p><p>\u201cGood morning Peter,\u201d you smiled, your best friend turned around to look at you. </p><p>\u201cMorning Y/N,\u201d he grinned back, he immediately turned his attention back towards the TV and you shook your head. Peter has been coming to the Stark Tower to train every morning and evening, including on the weekends. You\u2019ve watched him grow and mature as the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man but he was definitely still a fifteen year old teenage boy. He would arrive at the tower an hour or two early so he could play on Tony\u2019s state-of-the-art video game system, Tony had offered multiple times that he would buy Peter the same system so he could play at home, but he always refused because he didn\u2019t want to raise questions from his Aunt May. </p><p>You excitedly shuffled your way into the kitchen and opened up the pantry, to your relief a box of hot chocolate mix was waiting for you on the lower shelf and you quickly grabbed it. As soon as you moved it off the shelf, you noticed it was suspiciously light, you opened up the flaps and peered into the cardboard box. </p><p>Empty. </p><p>Your eyelid twitched as you stared at the box of lies. What kind of monster leaves an empty package inside the pantry? You swore there was a packet left last night and the only people who religiously drank hot chocolate was you\u2026and Peter Parker. </p><p>\u201cHey Pete?\u201d You called out, still angrily clutching the empty box in your hands. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He was focused on the game and didn\u2019t even notice that you had walked over and was sternly standing next to him. </p><p>\u201cDid you happen to have a cup of hot chocolate this morning?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDie!\u201d Peter shouted at the game, \u201cYeah, it was really cold on the way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me, you took the last hot chocolate packet, left the empty box in the pantry, and didn\u2019t bother to tell me that we\u2019re all out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, what\u2019s the big deal Y/N?\u201d </p><p>A frown stretched down your face and you felt your fists close slowly. <i>Don\u2019t punch him,</i> you whispered to yourself, <i>it\u2019s not worth explaining the black eye to Tony. </i>You knew you would actually never hurt Peter in a million years, but that thief needed to be punished. You combed through your brain for ideas and suddenly one popped up, you weren\u2019t even sure if it was going to work but it was better than nothing. </p><p>Peter was still completely engrossed in the game and didn\u2019t notice you crouching down next to him. Silently counting to three, you attacked his sides and wiggled your fingers as fast as you could. He let out a hilariously loud squeal and dropped the controller, he collapsed onto the floor and you quickly straddled his midsection so he couldn\u2019t escape. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ticklish!\u201d You laughed joyfully as you wildly tickled all over his upper body. He cackled and his face turned a deep red, you realized that he was incredibly sensitive and you wondered how no one knew about it. You noted that his ribs and sides were the most ticklish, especially when you turned your fingers into claws, and his belly was most sensitive to feather-light touches. His high pitched giggling and snorts were absolutely adorable, but you knew you should stop before he passed out. </p><p>\u201cY-you better not tell Tony about this,\u201d he stammered out, his hair was a complete mess and a goofy smile was plastered on his face, \u201cthe Avengers will torture me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah sure,\u201d you laughed, but you already had a devious plan formulating in your mind. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey Tony,\u201d you basically ran up to him, Peter was done with his training for the day so he had hopped into the shower before participating in movie night with the Avengers. Tony was in his workshop and making some adjustments to the Spider-Man suit when you broke his concentration by barreling through the doors. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it Y/N?\u201d He wiped his greasy hands on a rag and turned to face you, \u201cIf this is a complaint about tonight\u2019s choice of movie, bring it up to Bucky.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d you couldn\u2019t help but smile widely, \u201cI know a secret about Peter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSpill,\u201d Tony\u2019s full attention was on you and he crossed his arms, \u201che seemed distracted today, is it a crush at school?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s ticklish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be shitting me,\u201d he bursted out laughing, silently relieved that it was something innocent and nothing that related to Spider-Man. </p><p>\u201cLanguage.\u201d </p><p>You turned around to see Steve Rogers standing by the door, he had an amused smile on his face and raised an eyebrow at Tony\u2019s outburst. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all waiting for you two upstairs, what\u2019s the hold up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N told me something very interesting about our favorite Peter Parker,\u201d Tony grinned and Steve leaned in with interest, \u201che\u2019s ticklish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no way,\u201d he laughed, mischievously rubbing his hands together, \u201cthis is going to be fun.\u201d </p><p>\u2026</p><p>Bucky ended up choosing Grease for movie night, much to everyone\u2019s surprise. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Guys can watch chick flicks too,\u201d he had defended. </p><p>The Avengers settled in their usual spots on the couch, but tonight Peter was sandwiched between Tony and Steve. He didn\u2019t think much of it, but he started to get nervous when they were sitting awfully close to him. You plopped down next to Steve instead of your spot on the floor, Peter gave you a questioning look and you just shrugged innocently. </p><p>You\u2019ve never seen Grease before so you found yourself getting immersed in the film. The songs were catchy and everyone was humming along to Summer Nights, you wondered if you could fight in the long skirts the girls were wearing. While you were silently calculating the air resistance and the chances of the skirt getting caught on something, Peter\u2019s loud squeal made you jump out of your seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Nat clutched her chest and everyone\u2019s eyes fell on the blushing teenager. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! Mr. Stark poked me,\u201d he stammered. </p><p>\u201cMan Y/N was right about this one,\u201d Steve chuckled. </p><p><i>Shit. </i></p><p>Peter slowly turned to you with betrayal in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou told me you were going to keep it a secret!\u201d He shouted accusingly. </p><p>\u201cWe never pinkie swore to it so it was void,\u201d you slowly got up from the couch and bolted to the door. </p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t,\u201d Peter sprinted after you and quickly put on his web-shooter, before you reached the exit he fired a stream of web around your legs, making you crash to the floor. </p><p>\u201cThat was not fair,\u201d you groaned as Peter straddled your hips with a smile. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t fair when you did this,\u201d he suddenly dug his fingers into your belly and you screamed at the ticklish sensations. He copied exactly how you had tortured him earlier and you were silently kicking yourself for underestimating Spider-Man. Your hysterical laughter overpowered the movie and the Avengers decided to watch you being tickled to pieces by Peter. His wiggling fingers finally hit your ribs and you nearly bucked him off from the electric shocks that went down your spine. </p><p>\u201cO-Ok I\u2019m sorry!\u201d You screamed, you were sure you were going to pee or pass out from the torture.</p><p>\u201cThen I get an entire box of hot chocolate to myself,\u201d Peter slowly counted your ribs and your laughter was starting to turn silent.</p><p>\u201cF-fine,\u201d you managed to barely wheeze out. He stopped tickling you and laughed as you tried to get back your breath. Everyone suddenly remembered about the movie and turned back to the large flat screen TV. </p><p>\u201cAw man,\u201d Bucky groaned, \u201cwe missed sexy Sandy.\u201d </p><p>The Avengers\u2019 laughter filled the room and you weakly cracked a smile, now that everyone knew about you and Peter\u2019s sensitivities, life was going to be a bit interesting at the Stark Tower. </p>",

You swore there was a packet left last night and the only people who religiously drank hot chocolate was you\u2026and Peter Parker. </p><p>\u201cHey Pete?\u201d You called out, still angrily clutching the empty box in your hands. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He was focused on the game and didn\u2019t even notice that you had walked over and was sternly standing next to him. </p><p>\u201cDid you happen to have a cup of hot chocolate this morning?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDie!\u201d Peter shouted at the game, \u201cYeah, it was really cold on the way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me, you took the last hot chocolate packet, left the empty box in the pantry, and didn\u2019t bother to tell me that we\u2019re all out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, what\u2019s the big deal Y/N?\u201d </p><p>A frown stretched down your face and you felt your fists close slowly. <i>Don\u2019t punch him,</i> you whispered to yourself, <i>it\u2019s not worth explaining the black eye to Tony. </i>You knew you would actually never hurt Peter in a million years, but that thief needed to be punished. You combed through your brain for ideas and suddenly one popped up, you weren\u2019t even sure if it was going to work but it was better than nothing. </p><p>Peter was still completely engrossed in the game and didn\u2019t notice you crouching down next to him. Silently counting to three, you attacked his sides and wiggled your fingers as fast as you could. He let out a hilariously loud squeal and dropped the controller, he collapsed onto the floor and you quickly straddled his midsection so he couldn\u2019t escape. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ticklish!\u201d You laughed joyfully as you wildly tickled all over his upper body. He cackled and his face turned a deep red, you realized that he was incredibly sensitive and you wondered how no one knew about it. You noted that his ribs and sides were the most ticklish, especially when you turned your fingers into claws, and his belly was most sensitive to feather-light touches. His high pitched giggling and snorts were absolutely adorable, but you knew you should stop before he passed out. </p><p>\u201cY-you better not tell Tony about this,\u201d he stammered out, his hair was a complete mess and a goofy smile was plastered on his face, \u201cthe Avengers will torture me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah sure,\u201d you laughed, but you already had a devious plan formulating in your mind. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey Tony,\u201d you basically ran up to him, Peter was done with his training for the day so he had hopped into the shower before participating in movie night with the Avengers. Tony was in his workshop and making some adjustments to the Spider-Man suit when you broke his concentration by barreling through the doors. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it Y/N?\u201d He wiped his greasy hands on a rag and turned to face you, \u201cIf this is a complaint about tonight\u2019s choice of movie, bring it up to Bucky.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d you couldn\u2019t help but smile widely, \u201cI know a secret about Peter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSpill,\u201d Tony\u2019s full attention was on you and he crossed his arms, \u201che seemed distracted today, is it a crush at school?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s ticklish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be shitting me,\u201d he bursted out laughing, silently relieved that it was something innocent and nothing that related to Spider-Man. </p><p>\u201cLanguage.\u201d </p><p>You turned around to see Steve Rogers standing by the door, he had an amused smile on his face and raised an eyebrow at Tony\u2019s outburst. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all waiting for you two upstairs, what\u2019s the hold up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N told me something very interesting about our favorite Peter Parker,\u201d Tony grinned and Steve leaned in with interest, \u201che\u2019s ticklish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no way,\u201d he laughed, mischievously rubbing his hands together, \u201cthis is going to be fun.\u201d </p><p>\u2026</p><p>Bucky ended up choosing Grease for movie night, much to everyone\u2019s surprise. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Guys can watch chick flicks too,\u201d he had defended. </p><p>The Avengers settled in their usual spots on the couch, but tonight Peter was sandwiched between Tony and Steve. He didn\u2019t think much of it, but he started to get nervous when they were sitting awfully close to him. You plopped down next to Steve instead of your spot on the floor, Peter gave you a questioning look and you just shrugged innocently. </p><p>You\u2019ve never seen Grease before so you found yourself getting immersed in the film. The songs were catchy and everyone was humming along to Summer Nights, you wondered if you could fight in the long skirts the girls were wearing. While you were silently calculating the air resistance and the chances of the skirt getting caught on something, Peter\u2019s loud squeal made you jump out of your seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Nat clutched her chest and everyone\u2019s eyes fell on the blushing teenager. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! Mr. Stark poked me,\u201d he stammered. </p><p>\u201cMan Y/N was right about this one,\u201d Steve chuckled. </p><p><i>Shit. </i></p><p>Peter slowly turned to you with betrayal in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou told me you were going to keep it a secret!\u201d He shouted accusingly. </p><p>\u201cWe never pinkie swore to it so it was void,\u201d you slowly got up from the couch and bolted to the door. </p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t,\u201d Peter sprinted after you and quickly put on his web-shooter, before you reached the exit he fired a stream of web around your legs, making you crash to the floor. </p><p>\u201cThat was not fair,\u201d you groaned as Peter straddled your hips with a smile. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t fair when you did this,\u201d he suddenly dug his fingers into your belly and you screamed at the ticklish sensations. He copied exactly how you had tortured him earlier and you were silently kicking yourself for underestimating Spider-Man. Your hysterical laughter overpowered the movie and the Avengers decided to watch you being tickled to pieces by Peter. His wiggling fingers finally hit your ribs and you nearly bucked him off from the electric shocks that went down your spine. </p><p>\u201cO-Ok I\u2019m sorry!\u201d You screamed, you were sure you were going to pee or pass out from the torture.</p><p>\u201cThen I get an entire box of hot chocolate to myself,\u201d Peter slowly counted your ribs and your laughter was starting to turn silent.</p><p>\u201cF-fine,\u201d you managed to barely wheeze out. He stopped tickling you and laughed as you tried to get back your breath. Everyone suddenly remembered about the movie and turned back to the large flat screen TV. </p><p>\u201cAw man,\u201d Bucky groaned, \u201cwe missed sexy Sandy.\u201d </p><p>The Avengers\u2019 laughter filled the room and you weakly cracked a smile, now that everyone knew about you and Peter\u2019s sensitivities, life was going to be a bit interesting at the Stark Tower. </p>",

It was a bitter cold day in December and all you wanted was a warm cup of hot chocolate to jumpstart your day. </p><p>Pattering your way to the living room in your robe, you heard the familiar sounds of Assassin\u2019s Creed coming from the TV. JARVIS had turned on the heat and you enjoyed the warm blast of air hit your face as you entered the room. </p><p>\u201cGood morning Peter,\u201d you smiled, your best friend turned around to look at you. </p><p>\u201cMorning Y/N,\u201d he grinned back, he immediately turned his attention back towards the TV and you shook your head. Peter has been coming to the Stark Tower to train every morning and evening, including on the weekends. You\u2019ve watched him grow and mature as the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man but he was definitely still a fifteen year old teenage boy. He would arrive at the tower an hour or two early so he could play on Tony\u2019s state-of-the-art video game system, Tony had offered multiple times that he would buy Peter the same system so he could play at home, but he always refused because he didn\u2019t want to raise questions from his Aunt May. </p><p>You excitedly shuffled your way into the kitchen and opened up the pantry, to your relief a box of hot chocolate mix was waiting for you on the lower shelf and you quickly grabbed it.

His wiggling fingers finally hit your ribs and you nearly bucked him off from the electric shocks that went down your spine. </p><p>&ldquo;O-Ok I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; You screamed, you were sure you were going to pee or pass out from the torture.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I get an entire box of hot chocolate to myself,&rdquo; Peter slowly counted your ribs and your laughter was starting to turn silent.</p><p>&ldquo;F-fine,&rdquo; you managed to barely wheeze out. He stopped tickling you and laughed as you tried to get back your breath. Everyone suddenly remembered about the movie and turned back to the large flat screen TV. </p><p>&ldquo;Aw man,&rdquo; Bucky groaned, &ldquo;we missed sexy Sandy.&rdquo; </p><p>The Avengers&rsquo; laughter filled the room and you weakly cracked a smile, now that everyone knew about you and Peter&rsquo;s sensitivities, life was going to be a bit interesting at the Stark Tower. </p>",
