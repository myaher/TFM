This stopped being true very quickly as a blue Nissan Versa rounded a corner and barrelled down the road toward a comic book store. The screech of the vehicle&rsquo;s tires were nearly&ndash;although not quite&ndash;loud enough to drown out the Queen music it was blasting. As the Versa reached the comic book store, it pulled to a halt and a man in sunglasses stepped out.</p><p>As he walked in, the little bell on the door chimed, catching the attention of the shop&rsquo;s proprietor, who was currently lounging in a beanbag chair. He had been there for several hours now, or perhaps several days, depending on how long it took for dust to start gathering on someone.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re closed!&rdquo; Hiro called out without looking up from his first-edition original-run Superman comic. &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Hiro-kun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Lowering the comic, Hiro glanced up to see Ando leaning in the doorway, hand in his pocket. &ldquo;Ando-kun. What brings you here?&rdquo;</p><p>Ando grimaced as he walked over to sit down beside Hiro*. As he turned to face him, Ando took off his sunglasses and tucked them in his jacket pocket, showing off his snake eyes. Hiro looked at him expectantly. As much as he may have secretly wished otherwise, Ando didn&rsquo;t usually drop by without a reason. He wondered if he was going to invite him out to dinner again, or perhaps he just wanted to get drunk and unwind in Hiro&rsquo;s backroom.</p><p>[* he pulled up a chair that certainly hadn&rsquo;t been next to the beanbag chair before, and most likely would no longer be there after he stood back up.]</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Ando hesitated for a moment, then let out a beleaguered sigh. &ldquo;Armageddon is officially on.&rdquo;</p><p>Hiro blinked in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be time for that yet!&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t your side wait a little longer?&rdquo;</p><p>Ando shrugged as if to say, &ldquo;why not check the future for yourself if you don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, can&rsquo;t you tell them to put it off?&rdquo; Hiro persisted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the world to end yet! What about all my comics? And&ndash;well, all the people and cities and everything,&rdquo; he added quickly. &ldquo;Especially America. I must say, I&rsquo;ve gotten rather attached to America.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, believe me, I know,&rdquo; said Ando. &ldquo;It almost makes me think&hellip; hmm.&rdquo; He hummed in contemplation, brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hiro prompted.</p><p>&ldquo;Ehh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Ando said, waving his hand dismissively. &ldquo;Nothing that&rsquo;d ever work, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>At this, Hiro perked up. In his experience, there were a lot of things Ando thought wouldn&rsquo;t work that worked out just fine. Adjusting his glasses*, he leaned forward attentively to hear his counterpart&rsquo;s idea.</p><p>[* naturally, ethereal beings don&rsquo;t require any sort of eyewear, but Hiro opted to wear glasses because they matched his general disposition. At least, that was what he told the higher-ups. Truth be told, he kind of hoped his next corporation would have better eyesight.]</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Ando said, &ldquo;I suppose we could always try to save it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Save it?&rdquo; Hiro echoed. &ldquo;The world?&rdquo; His mouth quirked into a frown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but&hellip; do you think Upstairs would allow it? They&rsquo;re very strict about following the course of destiny, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Ando acknowledged. He leaned back in his chair, a wine bottle manifesting in his hand. &ldquo;Your side&rsquo;s uptight like that. No sinning, no questioning, no straying from the path of destiny&hellip;&rdquo; He paused to take a sip of wine and shot Hiro a meaningful look. &ldquo;&hellip;No comics, as you say. No waffles, either.&rdquo;</p><p>Right about then, a wine bottle appeared in Hiro&rsquo;s hand as well. He took a sip and reflected on what Ando was saying. Truth be told, saving the world did seem like a very exciting prospect. The superheros in his comics did it all the time, and they rarely saw any serious consequences for it. Still, if the world was supposed to end, then stopping it would be going against destiny.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know the world is ending, anyway?&rdquo; Hiro asked. &ldquo;Did you read it in a book of prophecy? Because those things are rarely accurate, you know. Except for the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Isaac Mendez, of course, but there aren&rsquo;t any copies of that left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. No books of prophecy,&rdquo; Ando told him. &ldquo;I know&hellip; because I just got back from delivering the antichrist.&rdquo;</p><p>Hiro&rsquo;s eyebrows rocketed up. &ldquo;Really?&rsquo;</p><p>&quot;Yep. We gave her to the family of an American diplomat*. She&rsquo;s a very cute baby, really, apart from the fact that she&rsquo;s the spawn of satan.&rdquo;</p><p>[* as far as Ando knew, the baby swap had gone perfectly.

As he turned to face him, Ando took off his sunglasses and tucked them in his jacket pocket, showing off his snake eyes. Hiro looked at him expectantly. As much as he may have secretly wished otherwise, Ando didn&rsquo;t usually drop by without a reason. He wondered if he was going to invite him out to dinner again, or perhaps he just wanted to get drunk and unwind in Hiro&rsquo;s backroom.</p><p>[* he pulled up a chair that certainly hadn&rsquo;t been next to the beanbag chair before, and most likely would no longer be there after he stood back up.]</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Ando hesitated for a moment, then let out a beleaguered sigh. &ldquo;Armageddon is officially on.&rdquo;</p><p>Hiro blinked in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be time for that yet!&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t your side wait a little longer?&rdquo;</p><p>Ando shrugged as if to say, &ldquo;why not check the future for yourself if you don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, can&rsquo;t you tell them to put it off?&rdquo; Hiro persisted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the world to end yet! What about all my comics? And&ndash;well, all the people and cities and everything,&rdquo; he added quickly. &ldquo;Especially America. I must say, I&rsquo;ve gotten rather attached to America.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, believe me, I know,&rdquo; said Ando. &ldquo;It almost makes me think&hellip; hmm.&rdquo; He hummed in contemplation, brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hiro prompted.</p><p>&ldquo;Ehh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Ando said, waving his hand dismissively. &ldquo;Nothing that&rsquo;d ever work, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>At this, Hiro perked up. In his experience, there were a lot of things Ando thought wouldn&rsquo;t work that worked out just fine. Adjusting his glasses*, he leaned forward attentively to hear his counterpart&rsquo;s idea.</p><p>[* naturally, ethereal beings don&rsquo;t require any sort of eyewear, but Hiro opted to wear glasses because they matched his general disposition. At least, that was what he told the higher-ups. Truth be told, he kind of hoped his next corporation would have better eyesight.]</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Ando said, &ldquo;I suppose we could always try to save it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Save it?&rdquo; Hiro echoed. &ldquo;The world?&rdquo; His mouth quirked into a frown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but&hellip; do you think Upstairs would allow it? They&rsquo;re very strict about following the course of destiny, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Ando acknowledged. He leaned back in his chair, a wine bottle manifesting in his hand. &ldquo;Your side&rsquo;s uptight like that. No sinning, no questioning, no straying from the path of destiny&hellip;&rdquo; He paused to take a sip of wine and shot Hiro a meaningful look. &ldquo;&hellip;No comics, as you say. No waffles, either.&rdquo;</p><p>Right about then, a wine bottle appeared in Hiro&rsquo;s hand as well. He took a sip and reflected on what Ando was saying. Truth be told, saving the world did seem like a very exciting prospect. The superheros in his comics did it all the time, and they rarely saw any serious consequences for it. Still, if the world was supposed to end, then stopping it would be going against destiny.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know the world is ending, anyway?&rdquo; Hiro asked. &ldquo;Did you read it in a book of prophecy? Because those things are rarely accurate, you know. Except for the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Isaac Mendez, of course, but there aren&rsquo;t any copies of that left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. No books of prophecy,&rdquo; Ando told him. &ldquo;I know&hellip; because I just got back from delivering the antichrist.&rdquo;</p><p>Hiro&rsquo;s eyebrows rocketed up. &ldquo;Really?&rsquo;</p><p>\"Yep. We gave her to the family of an American diplomat*. She&rsquo;s a very cute baby, really, apart from the fact that she&rsquo;s the spawn of satan.&rdquo;</p><p>[* as far as Ando knew, the baby swap had gone perfectly. A blonde-haired baby girl, whose new parents had named her Jackie, had indeed been delivered to the American diplomat. The other blonde-haired baby girl one room over, whose parents had named her Claire, was without a doubt a perfectly normal child and not the misplaced antichrist. Ando may or may not have been very wrong about this.]</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if the antichrist is on earth, I don&rsquo;t see what we can do,&rdquo; Hiro said, his shoulders sagging. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want to kill her&hellip; I suppose we could just lock her away somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who said anything about killing?&rdquo; Ando asked incredulously. &ldquo;I just thought maybe we could provide some outside influence to her. Prevent her from growing up evil, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ohh! That might work,&rdquo; Hiro said. For a moment he perked back up, only to immediately slump back down again when he remembered his side&rsquo;s non-interference policy. &ldquo;But Upstairs still isn&rsquo;t going to like it. We aren&rsquo;t supposed to get in the way of destiny, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know what our destiny is if the only accurate prophecy book has been destroyed?&rdquo; Ando countered. &ldquo;Hey, maybe it&rsquo;s our destiny to interfere and protect the earth. It&rsquo;s about as likely as anything, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Hiro stopped to think that over and to take a sip of wine. Outside the shop, cars drove by on the street as the sun sank lower in the sky. A bird cawed somewhere off in the distance. It was a nice city, and a nice planet, for that matter. Sure, there were other planets, but Hiro <i>did</i> like earth. He certainly didn&rsquo;t <i>want</i> it to be destroyed. And, well, if what Ando said was right&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it, then,&rdquo; he decided, breaking into a grin. &ldquo;Steer the antichrist onto the right path. Save the world!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or try to, anyway,&rdquo; Ando amended.</p><p>Grinning, Hiro snapped his fingers. Somewhere many miles away, a diner in Texas suddenly had a table reserved for two.</p><p>&ldquo;On that note, would you care for breakfast?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Angel, it&rsquo;s 5:30 PM.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not in America, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Hiro said. Laying his hand atop Ando&rsquo;s, he added, &ldquo;Besides, I still owe you from&hellip; what was it, the Edo period?&rdquo;</p><p>At that, Ando smiled. He laced his fingers through Hiro&rsquo;s&ndash;a typically wily demonic gesture&ndash;and lowered his sunglasses back over his eyes. Hiro snapped his fingers again, and the next moment, they were comfortably seated across from each other at the Burnt Toast Diner.</p><p>Throughout their meal, they built upon their plan until they were fairly confident in it. They were going to go undercover as a nanny and a gardener*, and they would each try to sway the antichrist toward their respective side. It was hard to tell how well it would work out, but Hiro, for one, was pretty optimistic.</p><p>[* Hiro called dibs on the position of gardener, not because he was particularly fond of gardens, but because he had no interest whatsoever in looking after babies, satanic or otherwise.]</p><p>In fact, as the night went on, Hiro became quite certain that the plan would work. Having it <i>not</i> work would mean armageddon, after all, and that was the last thing anybody wanted. How hard could it be, really? It all boiled down to simple cause and effect: raise the antichrist, save the world.</p>",
