Lucas halts in his movements a little, as if he had been caught doing something he shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d, he says, almost bashfully, throwing a quick glance at Eliott before turning his attention back to the garments. \u201dI didn\u2019t have any clean ones left.\u201d </p><p>Eliott can\u2019t help but grin at that, finding it endearing that Lucas still worries about crossing unspoken boundaries after four years together. They\u2019ve been sharing clothes ever since they first started dating, but admittedly never their underwear, Eliott realizes.\u00a0Judging by the sight in front of him, he can\u2019t possibly understand why.</p><p>He lets his gaze travel down the lines of Lucas\u2019s toned figure as he keeps observing him, the sculpted muscles of his back somehow just as prominent even in the low light of dusk. Eliott\u2019s boxers are somewhat too big for him, the hem resting dangerously low on his hips. His lean legs look as enticing as ever, causing Eliott to reminisce the feeling of having them wrapped around him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u201d, Eliott says after snapping out of his reverie, voice a bit gravelly in spite of his efforts to conceal it. \u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours\u201d, he states lowly as he starts moving toward Lucas, his steps slow but determined. Lucas only huffs out a laugh before he turns around, his motions freezing when his eyes meet Eliott\u2019s. </p><p>In moments like this, Eliott knows that the intensity of his stare is one of Lucas\u2019s weaknesses, but he still gloats internally each time he gets to witness how it affects him. </p><p>Tonight is certainly no exception. </p><p>As he shifts closer and closer, he can pinpoint the second Lucas starts to unfurl in front of him, the perfectly folded shirt in his hands unravelling as it falls to the floor. Eliott halts his movements when he is just a few inches away from him, mischievously intent on not touching him yet.</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, he decides to speak again, intentionally dragging the words out in a slow, steady pace.</p><p>\u201cI think that also means, that what\u2019s yours is mine\u201d, he says lowly, voice sounding husky even to his own ears. Lucas visibly gulps, swallowing as he holds Eliott\u2019s gaze. The air between them is turning heavy and electric, already overwhelmingly charged with want and hunger and need. Lucas\u2019s eyes briefly travel down to Eliott\u2019s lips, licking his own before he meets his gaze again, a playful glint revealing itself as he smirks. Eliott knows then that he has reeled Lucas in before he even speaks up.</p><p>\u201cProve it\u201d, Lucas says simply, his voice just as gravelly as Eliott\u2019s own.\u00a0</p><p>Eliott gladly accepts the challenge, taking a small step forward to test the waters. Lucas immediately catches on, letting himself be backed up until he\u2019s flush against the wall behind him, his bottom lip caught between his teeth. Eliott fights the urge to reach out and touch him, feel him, taste him, too intrigued by the compelling atmosphere to want to break out of it. The distance between them is only a few centimeters as they stare at each other, their eyes inevitably flicking to the lips of the other. Their close proximity makes the air feel unbearably thick, leaving Eliott\u2019s body on edge and burning, provoking him to make a move.</p><p>He leans down slightly, until his parted lips are only millimeters away from Lucas\u2019s awaiting ones. He lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding, hearing Lucas drawing it in as if his life depended on it. A quiet whimper escapes the boy as his eyes fall closed, and Eliott surrenders then. </p><p>Bringing his right hand up, he finally lets the tips of his fingers connect with the warm skin of the boy in front of him, lightly stroking his beautifully chiseled cheekbone. Eliott feels Lucas shudder from the contact, a silent cue for him to keep going. He gently maps his way down to Lucas\u2019s neck, crossing the frail collarbone, his firm chest, carefully tracing the carved lines of his abdominal muscles. When he reaches the hem of the underwear, he stops and lets his fingers linger for a moment, delicate and purposeful and wanting. Lucas gasps softly at the sensation, prompting Eliott to curl a finger under the fabric, pulling it lightly for it to loosen its hold on Lucas.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s yours is mine\u201d, he repeats hoarsely against Lucas\u2019s mouth as he reaches his hand inside the thin piece of clothing, taking hold of Lucas where he knows he craves it most. \u201cLook at me\u201d, he demands with a stern whisper, Lucas\u2019s eyes darting open almost comically fast. Lucas sighs into Eliott\u2019s mouth as he finally starts moving his hand, bringing the other one up to rest against the wall, caging Lucas in and blanketing him with the breadth of his shoulders. Lucas\u2019s eyes are already glazed with arousal, an alluring indication of what the night has in store for them. </p><p>Between heavy breaths and soft whines into the warmth of Eliott\u2019s mouth, Lucas eventually manages to find his broken voice, his eyes still locked with Eliott\u2019s as he confirms. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours.\u201d</p>",

Lucas only huffs out a laugh before he turns around, his motions freezing when his eyes meet Eliott&rsquo;s. </p><p>In moments like this, Eliott knows that the intensity of his stare is one of Lucas&rsquo;s weaknesses, but he still gloats internally each time he gets to witness how it affects him. </p><p>Tonight is certainly no exception. </p><p>As he shifts closer and closer, he can pinpoint the second Lucas starts to unfurl in front of him, the perfectly folded shirt in his hands unravelling as it falls to the floor. Eliott halts his movements when he is just a few inches away from him, mischievously intent on not touching him yet.</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, he decides to speak again, intentionally dragging the words out in a slow, steady pace.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that also means, that what&rsquo;s yours is mine&rdquo;, he says lowly, voice sounding husky even to his own ears. Lucas visibly gulps, swallowing as he holds Eliott&rsquo;s gaze. The air between them is turning heavy and electric, already overwhelmingly charged with want and hunger and need. Lucas&rsquo;s eyes briefly travel down to Eliott&rsquo;s lips, licking his own before he meets his gaze again, a playful glint revealing itself as he smirks. Eliott knows then that he has reeled Lucas in before he even speaks up.</p><p>&ldquo;Prove it&rdquo;, Lucas says simply, his voice just as gravelly as Eliott&rsquo;s own.&nbsp;</p><p>Eliott gladly accepts the challenge, taking a small step forward to test the waters. Lucas immediately catches on, letting himself be backed up until he&rsquo;s flush against the wall behind him, his bottom lip caught between his teeth. Eliott fights the urge to reach out and touch him, feel him, taste him, too intrigued by the compelling atmosphere to want to break out of it. The distance between them is only a few centimeters as they stare at each other, their eyes inevitably flicking to the lips of the other. Their close proximity makes the air feel unbearably thick, leaving Eliott&rsquo;s body on edge and burning, provoking him to make a move.</p><p>He leans down slightly, until his parted lips are only millimeters away from Lucas&rsquo;s awaiting ones. He lets out a breath he didn&rsquo;t know he was holding, hearing Lucas drawing it in as if his life depended on it. A quiet whimper escapes the boy as his eyes fall closed, and Eliott surrenders then. </p><p>Bringing his right hand up, he finally lets the tips of his fingers connect with the warm skin of the boy in front of him, lightly stroking his beautifully chiseled cheekbone. Eliott feels Lucas shudder from the contact, a silent cue for him to keep going. He gently maps his way down to Lucas&rsquo;s neck, crossing the frail collarbone, his firm chest, carefully tracing the carved lines of his abdominal muscles. When he reaches the hem of the underwear, he stops and lets his fingers linger for a moment, delicate and purposeful and wanting. Lucas gasps softly at the sensation, prompting Eliott to curl a finger under the fabric, pulling it lightly for it to loosen its hold on Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours is mine&rdquo;, he repeats hoarsely against Lucas&rsquo;s mouth as he reaches his hand inside the thin piece of clothing, taking hold of Lucas where he knows he craves it most. &ldquo;Look at me&rdquo;, he demands with a stern whisper, Lucas&rsquo;s eyes darting open almost comically fast. Lucas sighs into Eliott&rsquo;s mouth as he finally starts moving his hand, bringing the other one up to rest against the wall, caging Lucas in and blanketing him with the breadth of his shoulders. Lucas&rsquo;s eyes are already glazed with arousal, an alluring indication of what the night has in store for them. </p><p>Between heavy breaths and soft whines into the warmth of Eliott&rsquo;s mouth, Lucas eventually manages to find his broken voice, his eyes still locked with Eliott&rsquo;s as he confirms. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s mine is yours.&rdquo;</p>",

The sun is mere minutes from fully setting, casting the room in a golden haze, pinks and purples lingering to coat the walls with their hues.</p>\n<p>Eliott is standing in the doorway of their bedroom, leaning against the frame of it as he watches Lucas fold their fresh laundry, neatly putting it away in their shared wardrobe. The soft light is enveloping his sun-kissed skin, silently painting him to match the world outside of their bubble. A particularly familiar pair of boxers is the only thing covering him, quickly making Eliott feel far too clothed for the occasion.</p>\n</p>",
