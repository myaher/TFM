There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn&rsquo;t know that, Bran was convinced.",

        "answer": "<p>I get where you\u2019re coming from, Anon, and I agree to some extent. However, the only POV that really feels <i>way</i> too old to me is Bran\u2019s. GRRM has said that he has trouble with Bran\u2019s POV the most because it\u2019s hard to write from the mind of someone that young, and yeah, it shows in his writing sometimes. Even with Bran, though, there are plenty of times when Bran sounds age appropriate (Like \u201cWhy would anyone kill Jory?\u201d or\u00a0\u201cHe sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.\u201d)</p><p>But, you asked for examples, so here\u2019s my thoughts on it:</p><p>Jon\u2019s POV is age appropriate, to an extent. At the start of his story, he\u2019s an angsty, bratty teen with a good heart, and reads like it, for the most part.<br/></p><p>I think Sansa and Arya start off acting their age, for sure. Sansa\u2019s romanticism in the beginning of her arc is age appropriate, and written accordingly. I love that Arya calls everything and everyone \u201cstupid,\u201d and Sansa refers to her stomach as her \u201ctummy.\u201d Language like that definitely shows their age. Also, Sansa and Arya\u2019s sisterly beef with each other is written perfectly, considering their ages.</p><p>However, after Sansa goes through her trauma and has grown accustomed to being a prisoner, her POV matures in a way that, while fascinating to read, still feels a bit too\u00a0\u201cold\u201d sometimes in my opinion, if that makes sense. Like, she\u2019s just 13, but she tends to sound like someone in their later teens, and though that doesn\u2019t sound like a huge difference, the mind of someone who\u2019s 17-19 is far different from someone who just turned 13. I get why GRRM would do that, because trauma can definitely age a child, and it\u2019s beautiful writing, but I think sometimes it\u2019s just too old in how it reads. IIRC, though (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m not a Sansa expert), she still calls her stomach her\u00a0\u201ctummy,\u201d so there\u2019s that. That word is associated with youth and innocence, so when Sansa starts saying\u00a0\u201cstomach\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbelly\u201d more than\u00a0\u201ctummy\u201d &hellip; I think it\u2019ll be kinda sad, because it will represent more of her lost/stolen innocence, due to her trauma.</p><p>I think George does a better job with making Arya still sound childish, even after she\u2019s traumatized. The way she thinks of her lost identity (\u201chad she dreamed Arya Stark?\u201d) gets the job done as far as storytelling and characterization goes, while saying it in a\u00a0\u201cchildish\u201d way.</p><p>Dany\u2019s POV is weird. Sometimes she sounds young \u2014 maybe not as young as 13, but considering her backstory, she\u2019s been forced to grow up long before the Stark children, so that makes sense. I think if her story started when she was 15 instead of 13, it would sound more\u00a0\u201cright,\u201d but honestly, with the whole dramatically written crush over Daario and the mistakes she makes as a ruler, I think you can tell that she\u2019s a teenager.</p><p>I think Theon\u2019s POV is age appropriate. He\u2019s college age, and acts like a particularly douchey frat boy. And when the Reek thing happens, he\u2019s old enough that the change in prose doesn\u2019t sound awkward. It\u2019s all written perfectly.</p><p>Also, if non-POV characters count, Tommen and Sweetrobin act pretty age appropriate. Myrcella feels like an intelligent child. I don\u2019t know, I think GRRM does a good job on this for the most part.\u00a0</p>",

                "content": "<p>I get where you&rsquo;re coming from, Anon, and I agree to some extent. However, the only POV that really feels <i>way</i> too old to me is Bran&rsquo;s. GRRM has said that he has trouble with Bran&rsquo;s POV the most because it&rsquo;s hard to write from the mind of someone that young, and yeah, it shows in his writing sometimes. Even with Bran, though, there are plenty of times when Bran sounds age appropriate (Like &ldquo;Why would anyone kill Jory?&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.&rdquo;)</p><p>But, you asked for examples, so here&rsquo;s my thoughts on it:</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s POV is age appropriate, to an extent. At the start of his story, he&rsquo;s an angsty, bratty teen with a good heart, and reads like it, for the most part.<br /></p><p>I think Sansa and Arya start off acting their age, for sure. Sansa&rsquo;s romanticism in the beginning of her arc is age appropriate, and written accordingly. I love that Arya calls everything and everyone &ldquo;stupid,&rdquo; and Sansa refers to her stomach as her &ldquo;tummy.&rdquo; Language like that definitely shows their age. Also, Sansa and Arya&rsquo;s sisterly beef with each other is written perfectly, considering their ages.</p><p>However, after Sansa goes through her trauma and has grown accustomed to being a prisoner, her POV matures in a way that, while fascinating to read, still feels a bit too&nbsp;&ldquo;old&rdquo; sometimes in my opinion, if that makes sense. Like, she&rsquo;s just 13, but she tends to sound like someone in their later teens, and though that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a huge difference, the mind of someone who&rsquo;s 17-19 is far different from someone who just turned 13. I get why GRRM would do that, because trauma can definitely age a child, and it&rsquo;s beautiful writing, but I think sometimes it&rsquo;s just too old in how it reads. IIRC, though (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, I&rsquo;m not a Sansa expert), she still calls her stomach her&nbsp;&ldquo;tummy,&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s that. That word is associated with youth and innocence, so when Sansa starts saying&nbsp;&ldquo;stomach&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;belly&rdquo; more than&nbsp;&ldquo;tummy&rdquo; &hellip; I think it&rsquo;ll be kinda sad, because it will represent more of her lost/stolen innocence, due to her trauma.</p><p>I think George does a better job with making Arya still sound childish, even after she&rsquo;s traumatized. The way she thinks of her lost identity (&ldquo;had she dreamed Arya Stark?&rdquo;) gets the job done as far as storytelling and characterization goes, while saying it in a&nbsp;&ldquo;childish&rdquo; way.</p><p>Dany&rsquo;s POV is weird.

Your mother had brought you the best handmaidens out there to groom you for your first meeting to your betrothed.</p><p>You hated it. You felt a absolutely ridiculous with the gown they had chosen for you to wear today: it was a baby pink gown with very long sleeves you were afraid to step on. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless&rdquo; you thought. Your betrothed was from the noble House Stark, located in the North, you&rsquo;d have to wear a furry coat on top of it so you didn&rsquo;t die from the cold, no one was going to notice the dress.</p><p>That was not the worst thing. You almost begged your mother to let you wear something black. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous, we&rsquo;re not attending a funeral Y/N&rdquo; she said. </p><p>You wanted wear black because it&rsquo;s the color you felt comfortable with, now they were dressing you up like you were a doll. Sometimes you just wished you could look like your sisters, with their thin and delicate bodies. </p><p>That way people wouldn&rsquo;t give you &lsquo;looks&rsquo; while you&rsquo;re just walking around, whispering behind your back, thinking you can&rsquo;t hear them. And you couldn&rsquo;t. But you could imagine what they were saying. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s nothing like her mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;her sisters are so beautiful&rdquo;, &ldquo;she should take care of her self more&rdquo; </p><p>The list continued. The thing was: you didn&rsquo;t care, not anymore at least. You had grown as a woman, for the better; you didn&rsquo;t listen to what those people said because the only one who knew you really was yourself and that was more than enough for you. </p><p>The trip didn&rsquo;t take more than 2 days, your city wasn&rsquo;t so far from Winterfell so it was good. If you were nervous before, now you felt like dying. </p><p>Once the doors opened, you tried your best to take a look from inside the carriage. The Starks where the people standing at the front, you assumed. </p><p>There were only two boys, one of them had curly hair and beautiful eyes but he was holding hands with a woman; 'he&rsquo;s already married, that&rsquo;s not Bran Stark&rsquo;, you thought. The other one was blonde ish, but he was too young to be Bran, would your father be capable of marrying you with someone younger? </p><p>The Herald of Arms announced each member of your family. Once you were out of the carriage your father took your hand carefully and gave you a loving look. He might not be present most of the time but he was a great father and with that gesture you felt a little less nervous. </p><p>You found yourself about to pass out because of the nerves when you stood in front of the Starks. Your father and Lord Stark shared a hug, while your mother was greeted by Lady Stark. She was a beautiful woman, your thought. </p><p>When they finished talking your father reached to you, signaling you to take a step closer. </p><p>\u201cThis is my beautiful daughter, Y/N&quot; your father said and you felt like dying when everyone standing in front of you looked in your direction. </p><p>You looked down, not wanting to see their expressions, but you had to be polite. When you lifted your head, everyone had a smile on their faces, <i>honest smiles.</i> They made you feel so welcome you were in complete awe. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to Winterfell, Y/N&rdquo; Lord Stark reached to you and took your hand in his, giving you a smile, so genuine. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, let me introduce you to my son Bran&rdquo; you were ready to greet to young blonde boy but then he took step aside and you were able to see the boy sitting on a wheelchair, staring a you. You weren\u2019t really surprised but you felt kind of bad knowing that you hadn\u2019t acknowledged him before. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Y/N, it&rsquo;s nice too meet you&rdquo; he said to you. He sounded so sincere, you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile widely at him. </p><p>The day went by, while both families were sharing a fest. Bran and you tried several times to star a conversation but the music was so loud, you just couldn\u2019t hear each other. He suggested you to join him for a walk so he could show you Winterfell around. Of course you said yes. </p><p>Bran showed you every little thing. Winterfell was incredibly beautiful, it wasn&rsquo;t very far from your city but it was surprisingly different, the architecture was breathtaking and what surprised you the most was the dire wolves running around like dogs. The weather was also different, you weren\u2019t used to this much cold. </p><p>You had to carry him around but you didn&rsquo;t care, you had so much fun with him and it was so easy to start conversation, there were no uncomfortable silences. </p><p>When you were finishing your little tour, you reached the Weirwood, your family was devoted to the Old Gods too so you were familiar with it and even though you had seen paintings of this tree from your maester&rsquo;s book several times, clearly it didn\u2019t compare to see it in all its glory. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s so beautiful, I&rsquo;ve never seen one of them&rdquo; you looked at Bran and he was smiling at you. </p><p>Your felt the heat on your cheeks. You were stupidly surprised by a tree. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;ve just&hellip; I&rsquo;ve just never seen one of them and I grew up with stories about the Old Gods, I got a little excited&rdquo; you sat next to him. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Y/N, really, I like that you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself, this will be your home soon&rdquo; he said and you looked at him, he was a beautiful boy for sure: pale skin that looked so soft and pink lips, he was actually breathtaking and you suddenly felt bad for him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry&rdquo; you blurted. </p><p>Bran looked at you with a confused expression. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re betrothed to me, there are plenty of better options.&rdquo; </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t dare to look at him but you were surprised when he took your hand and interlaced your fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N please, look at me&rdquo; </p><p>Slowly, you did. He was looking at you tenderly, and when you connected your eyes with his, you both smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful, and I don&rsquo;t really need five years of marriage to know you&rsquo;re a very fun person with an amazing personality, our little Winterfell tour was all I needed to know I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m betrothed to you&rdquo; you didn&rsquo;t want to, but you could feel the tears about to enter the scene &ldquo;Look at me, I&rsquo;m a cripple, but I know I&rsquo;m so much more. And there&rsquo;s you, you don&rsquo;t have to look like every girl to be breathtaking, you already are&rdquo; you couldn&rsquo;t help it you hugged him tightly and he embraced you letting out a little laugh.  </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an amazing person Bran Stark&rdquo; you said to and then realized you were inches apart when you said so. He looked at you intently. </p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a beautiful girl and a good person, I&rsquo;m thankful I get to marry you soon&rdquo; the two of you stared at each other, wondering if it was okay. You surely didn&rsquo;t want to rush things, you had meet him not so long ago but he already had your heart. </p><p>No one ever, who wasn&rsquo;t a part of your family, was interested on knowing you and then Bran came in the picture all of a sudden, appreciating you for who you were and not asking for more or less. </p><p>And you did the same for him. Because you were able to see more than Bran the cripple, he was so much more and he was your future husband. </p><p>You stared into each other eyes and then Bran closed the distance between the two of you. His lips were soft against yours, and moved slowly, one of his hands was caressing your cheek lovingly, you never expected for this to happen, it felt unreal.  </p><p>But right in this boy&rsquo;s arms you felt safe. You felt home</p>",

Your mother had brought you the best handmaidens out there to groom you for your first meeting to your betrothed.</p><p>You hated it. You felt a absolutely ridiculous with the gown they had chosen for you to wear today: it was a baby pink gown with very long sleeves you were afraid to step on. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless\u201d you thought. Your betrothed was from the noble House Stark, located in the North, you\u2019d have to wear a furry coat on top of it so you didn\u2019t die from the cold, no one was going to notice the dress.</p><p>That was not the worst thing. You almost begged your mother to let you wear something black. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, we\u2019re not attending a funeral Y/N\u201d she said. </p><p>You wanted wear black because it\u2019s the color you felt comfortable with, now they were dressing you up like you were a doll. Sometimes you just wished you could look like your sisters, with their thin and delicate bodies. </p><p>That way people wouldn\u2019t give you \u2018looks\u2019 while you\u2019re just walking around, whispering behind your back, thinking you can\u2019t hear them. And you couldn\u2019t. But you could imagine what they were saying. </p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s nothing like her mother\u201d, \u201cher sisters are so beautiful\u201d, \u201cshe should take care of her self more\u201d </p><p>The list continued. The thing was: you didn\u2019t care, not anymore at least. You had grown as a woman, for the better; you didn\u2019t listen to what those people said because the only one who knew you really was yourself and that was more than enough for you. </p><p>The trip didn\u2019t take more than 2 days, your city wasn\u2019t so far from Winterfell so it was good. If you were nervous before, now you felt like dying. </p><p>Once the doors opened, you tried your best to take a look from inside the carriage. The Starks where the people standing at the front, you assumed. </p><p>There were only two boys, one of them had curly hair and beautiful eyes but he was holding hands with a woman; 'he\u2019s already married, that\u2019s not Bran Stark\u2019, you thought. The other one was blonde ish, but he was too young to be Bran, would your father be capable of marrying you with someone younger? </p><p>The Herald of Arms announced each member of your family. Once you were out of the carriage your father took your hand carefully and gave you a loving look. He might not be present most of the time but he was a great father and with that gesture you felt a little less nervous. </p><p>You found yourself about to pass out because of the nerves when you stood in front of the Starks. Your father and Lord Stark shared a hug, while your mother was greeted by Lady Stark. She was a beautiful woman, your thought. </p><p>When they finished talking your father reached to you, signaling you to take a step closer. </p><p>\u201cThis is my beautiful daughter, Y/N\" your father said and you felt like dying when everyone standing in front of you looked in your direction. </p><p>You looked down, not wanting to see their expressions, but you had to be polite. When you lifted your head, everyone had a smile on their faces, <i>honest smiles.</i> They made you feel so welcome you were in complete awe. </p><p>\u201cWelcome to Winterfell, Y/N\u201d Lord Stark reached to you and took your hand in his, giving you a smile, so genuine. </p><p>\u201cPlease, let me introduce you to my son Bran\u201d you were ready to greet to young blonde boy but then he took step aside and you were able to see the boy sitting on a wheelchair, staring a you. You weren\u2019t really surprised but you felt kind of bad knowing that you hadn\u2019t acknowledged him before. </p><p>\u201cLady Y/N, it\u2019s nice too meet you\u201d he said to you. He sounded so sincere, you couldn\u2019t help but smile widely at him. </p><p>The day went by, while both families were sharing a fest. Bran and you tried several times to star a conversation but the music was so loud, you just couldn\u2019t hear each other. He suggested you to join him for a walk so he could show you Winterfell around. Of course you said yes. </p><p>Bran showed you every little thing. Winterfell was incredibly beautiful, it wasn\u2019t very far from your city but it was surprisingly different, the architecture was breathtaking and what surprised you the most was the dire wolves running around like dogs. The weather was also different, you weren\u2019t used to this much cold. </p><p>You had to carry him around but you didn\u2019t care, you had so much fun with him and it was so easy to start conversation, there were no uncomfortable silences. </p><p>When you were finishing your little tour, you reached the Weirwood, your family was devoted to the Old Gods too so you were familiar with it and even though you had seen paintings of this tree from your maester\u2019s book several times, clearly it didn\u2019t compare to see it in all its glory. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s so beautiful, I\u2019ve never seen one of them\u201d you looked at Bran and he was smiling at you. </p><p>Your felt the heat on your cheeks. You were stupidly surprised by a tree. </p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve just\u2026 I\u2019ve just never seen one of them and I grew up with stories about the Old Gods, I got a little excited\u201d you sat next to him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Y/N, really, I like that you\u2019re enjoying yourself, this will be your home soon\u201d he said and you looked at him, he was a beautiful boy for sure: pale skin that looked so soft and pink lips, he was actually breathtaking and you suddenly felt bad for him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u201d you blurted. </p><p>Bran looked at you with a confused expression. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re betrothed to me, there are plenty of better options.\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t dare to look at him but you were surprised when he took your hand and interlaced your fingers. </p><p>\u201cY/N please, look at me\u201d </p><p>Slowly, you did. He was looking at you tenderly, and when you connected your eyes with his, you both smiled. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, and I don\u2019t really need five years of marriage to know you\u2019re a very fun person with an amazing personality, our little Winterfell tour was all I needed to know I\u2019m glad I\u2019m betrothed to you\u201d you didn\u2019t want to, but you could feel the tears about to enter the scene \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m a cripple, but I know I\u2019m so much more. And there\u2019s you, you don\u2019t have to look like every girl to be breathtaking, you already are\u201d you couldn\u2019t help it you hugged him tightly and he embraced you letting out a little laugh.  </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an amazing person Bran Stark\u201d you said to and then realized you were inches apart when you said so. He looked at you intently. </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a beautiful girl and a good person, I\u2019m thankful I get to marry you soon\u201d the two of you stared at each other, wondering if it was okay. You surely didn\u2019t want to rush things, you had meet him not so long ago but he already had your heart. </p><p>No one ever, who wasn\u2019t a part of your family, was interested on knowing you and then Bran came in the picture all of a sudden, appreciating you for who you were and not asking for more or less. </p><p>And you did the same for him.
