Grey worm was standing in front of them in the sun\nwith Tyrion by his side, with chains around his wrists. It was an intense\nmoment as you inhaled deep, softly pushing your fingers deeper into Bran\u2019s\nshoulder. Tyrion looked brief at Grey worm before he started to speak. \u2013 \u201cJon\u2019s\nfaith is to be decided by our king\u2026 or queen.\u201d \u2013 Tyrion then looked humble at\neach and everyone of them as a lord sitting next to Lord Arryn spoke. \u2013 \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t have a king or queen?\u201d \u2013 Tyrion softly nodded with his head as he smiled\nfaintly. \u2013 \u201cYou are all the most powerful people in Westeros\u2026 choose one\u201d </p><p>Tyrion\nlooked up to Grey worm who exhaled deep, keeping his face in a firm expression.\n\u2013 \u201cMake your choice then!\u201d \u2013 You could hear at the tone of Grey worm\u2019s voice\nthat he rather had Jon be executed for his actions right now. Another moment of\nsilence broke free as everyone looked at each other without moving a bit. The\ntension was nerve-racking as you grabbed Bran\u2019s shoulder even tighter. Your\nmuscles relaxed a bit as you felt Bran\u2019s hand touch yours that laid on his\nshoulder. Sansa made some eye contact with Yara beside her as Brienne of Tarth\nlooked brief at you. Suddenly the Stark\u2019s uncle\u2019s chair cracked as he got up\nand stepped closer into the middle. </p><!-- more --><p>You looked\nwith curious eyes at his movements as Bran had let go of your hand. \u2013 \u201cMy lords\nand ladies\u2026\u201d \u2013 he started as he cleared his throat soft. \u2013 \u201cI suppose this is\nthe most important moment of our lives\u2026\u201d \u2013 Everyone was staring at him as Tyrion\nshook softly his head. \u2013 \u201cWhat we decided today will forever live on in\nhistory! I stand before you as one of the senior lords of the country\u201d \u2013 You\npressed your lips softly together as the tension was getting to much. \u2013 \u201cA\nveteran of two wars and I\u2019d like to think my experiences lead to some small\u2026-\u201c-\nHe continued to speak as suddenly a voice broke through his speech. \u2013 \u201cUncle!\u201d\n\u2013 Sansa had spoken as everyone looked directly at her. \u2013 \u201cPlease sit!\u201d \u2013 He\nblinked a bit confused as Sansa signalled to his seat with her head. </p><p>Her uncle\nlooked nervously around as everyone started to hide their laughs. You also\ntried to hide your laughing as you were impressed by Sansa\u2019s sudden comment.\nHer uncle then looked behind him as Sam pretended to look at anywhere but him\nas he knew how awkward that was. He then looked at Sansa with an expression,\nmaking it clear to her that he didn\u2019t appreciated her comment. He then stepped\nback as he wanted to seat himself down, but his sword bumped against the side.\nYou chuckled quietly as Bran looked up at you. You immediately stopped laughing\nas you knew it was wrong from you to laugh at his uncle. </p><p>\u201cWe have to\nchoose someone?\u201d \u2013 the same elderly man said that was sitting next to Lord\nArryn. Sam Tarly cleared his throat as everyone looked at him in silence. \u2013\n\u201cWhy just us?\u201d \u2013 you frowned deep as Sam got up from his seat, nervously. \u2013 \u201cWe\nrepresent all the great houses but whoever we choose won\u2019t just rule over lords\nand ladies\u2026\u201d \u2013 You listened closely as Sam was indeed right. \u2013 \u201cMaybe the\ndecision about what\u2019s best for everyone should be left to \u2026 oh\u2026 well everyone?\u201d\n\u2013 Immediately started several ladies and lords to chuckle quietly as they\ndidn\u2019t want to hear another word of this strange request from Sam.</p><p>As everyone\nwas looking at each other some lords started to laugh loud at his silly\nrequest. \u2013 \u201cMaybe we should give the dogs a vote as well!\u201d \u2013 Bran\u2019s uncle\nlaughed out as everyone was laughing at Sam. Sam smiled faintly as he tried to\nhide his sadness and seated himself quickly down. \u2013 \u201cShould I ask my horse?\u201d \u2013\nthe old lord laughed out as you had enough of their laughter. \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s\nenough!\u201d \u2013 you called out in a calm but powerful tone as they suddenly stopped\nlaughing. \u2013 \u201cI suppose you want the crown?\u201d \u2013 Bran\u2019s uncle asked Tyrion as\nTyrion was looking down in a humble way. \u2013 \u201cMe? The imp?\u201d \u2013 he shook his head\nas you felt like there was no progress. \u2013 \u201cHalf of the people hate me for\nserving Daenerys, the other half hates me for betraying her\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tyrion then\nbriefly looked at Grey Worm who still stood in his soldier position. </p><p>\u201cWho then?\u201d\n\u2013 Sir Davos spoke as Tyrion took a deep breath. \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing else to do\nbut think these past few weeks\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tyrion started again, - \u201cabout our bloody\nhistory!\u201d \u2013 He looked brief at his right as he continued, - \u201cAbout the mistakes\nwe\u2019ve made\u2026\u201d \u2013 He looked again brief at Grey worm who rejected his apologetic\nexpression as Tyrion suddenly looked in front of him at you. \u2013 \u201cWhat unites\npeople?\u201d \u2013 he spoke again as he started to walk around. \u2013 \u201cArmies? Gold? Flags?\u201d\n\u2013 he shook his head as he looked up to his left. \u2013 \u201cStories\u2026\u201d </p><p>Tyrion kept\nwalking around as he suddenly paused and slowly turned around. \u2013 \u201cAnd who has a\nbetter story than Y/n the valiant!\u201d \u2013 All the lord and ladies\u2019 eyes went\nstraight to you as you lifted your hands up from Bran\u2019s shoulder out of shock.\nSansa and Arya looked at you with shock as Tyrion kept looking directly at you.\n\u2013 \u201cLost both of her parents in the war\u2026 Survived for many years alone\u2026 helped\nBrandon Stark on his journey beyond the wall\u2026\u201d \u2013 Everyone kept looking at you\nas Tyrion kept telling everyone your life\u2019s story. \u2013 \u201cShowed more bravery then\nanyone I know\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tyrion nodded soft at you as you still couldn\u2019t believe that\nTyrion wanted you to be Queen of the seven kingdoms. </p><p>\u201cWas\nprepared to sacrifice her own life for the people of Kingslanding that weren\u2019t\neven her own\u2026\u201d \u2013 You were so overwhelmed that you took a step closer to Tyrion,\nstanding next to Bran. \u2013 \u201cIn the many times I\u2019ve encountered Y/n she kept\nsurprising me with her determination and bravery\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tyrion now spoke to the\nother lords and Ladies as Sansa bit her lip, looking not very pleased with the\noutcome. \u2013 \u201cIf there was someone I would believe in, it would be Y/n the\nvaliant!\u201d \u2013 You gasped soft as Bran had taken your hand and placed a kiss on\nit. </p><p>\u201cY/n can\u2019t\nrule the seven kingdoms?\u201d \u2013 Sansa said as you looked at her. \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s to young\nand Bran can\u2019t bare her children!\u201d \u2013 You gave her a foul look as Bran looked\nthe same at her. \u2013 \u201cGood!\u201d \u2013 Tyrion said, - \u201cChildren of a Queen can be cruel\nand stupid\u2026 as you know all too well\u2026\u201d \u00a0-\nSansa stopped talking as Tyrion had shown her, her place. \u2013 \u201cI believe in her!\u201d\n\u2013 Bran spoke as he looked up to you and smiled. \u2013 \u201cI believe in her too! She\nwill be a great queen that will value the voice of her people!\u201d \u2013 Arya said as\nshe nodded at you. You nodded back at her as Bran kissed your hand again. </p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d \u2013\nTyrion asked you as you took some deep breaths. Tyrion then looked at everyone\nelse to see if anyone would protest. \u2013 \u201cI believe we should vote then\u2026\u201d \u2013\nTyrion looked at his left as you held Bran\u2019s hand firm. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 the first\nmen said out loud as it only increased your nerves. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 the second and\nthe third said. It went so on until you reached Sansa, she turned her body\ntowards you as you prepared yourself to hear a no. \u2013 \u201cY/n if you let me\u2026 I want\nthe north to be a free and an independent country\u2026 it has suffered more than\nenough for Westeros!\u201d \u2013 You were surprised by her request, but you understood\nit fully. </p><p>\u201cThe North\nis from this day on an independent country!\u201d \u2013 You called out as Sansa bowed\nher head out of respect to you. You did the same as you held one hand near your\nheart. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 she then said out loud, looking directly at Tyrion. Aria and\nBran also said loud \u2018Aye!\u2019 as only a few more needed to say their vote. The\nrest of the lords and ladies all said \u2018Aye!\u2019 as Tyrion ended his vote with a\nnod. Tyrion then signalled to you as you took some more steps, making yourself\nmore visible for everyone. \u2013 \u201cAll hail Y/n the valiant, First of her name\u2026Queen\nof the Andals and the first men. Lady of the six kingdoms and protector of the\nrealm!\u201d </p><p>It felt\nglorious to hear the title come out of Tyrion\u2019s mouth as he bowed his head in\nrespect of you. Everyone started to clap loud for you as Tyrion smiled at you.\nYou then moved to the back of Bran\u2019s wheelchair as you started to push him\naway, all the others followed you as the council was over. Their Queen had been\nchosen and now they could all return home. You rolled with him in silence past\nTyrion as you paused for a moment. \u2013 \u201cGrey worm! I will make sure Tyrion will\nbe faced with his actions at my council!\u201d \u2013 Grey worm nodded with a forced expression\nas he removed the chains from around Tyrion\u2019s wrists. \u2013 \u201cThank you, My queen!\u201d \u2013\nTyrion said as you nodded at him and continued to walk with Bran to somewhere\nyou could be alone. You leaded him to your tent as Kingslanding needed to be\nrebuild and it was to dangerous now to head into the city. </p><p>You parked\nBran\u2019s wheelchair near your bed as you stretched your back a bit, moving over\nto the mirror stand.

He then looked at Sansa with an expression,\nmaking it clear to her that he didn\u2019t appreciated her comment. He then stepped\nback as he wanted to seat himself down, but his sword bumped against the side.\nYou chuckled quietly as Bran looked up at you.

Gold? Flags?\u201d\n\u2013 he shook his head as he looked up to his left. \u2013 \u201cStories\u2026\u201d </p><p>Tyrion kept\nwalking around as he suddenly paused and slowly turned around. \u2013 \u201cAnd who has a\nbetter story than Y/n the valiant!\u201d \u2013 All the lord and ladies\u2019 eyes went\nstraight to you as you lifted your hands up from Bran\u2019s shoulder out of shock.\nSansa and Arya looked at you with shock as Tyrion kept looking directly at you.\n\u2013 \u201cLost both of her parents in the war\u2026 Survived for many years alone\u2026 helped\nBrandon Stark on his journey beyond the wall\u2026\u201d \u2013 Everyone kept looking at you\nas Tyrion kept telling everyone your life\u2019s story. \u2013 \u201cShowed more bravery then\nanyone I know\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tyrion nodded soft at you as you still couldn\u2019t believe that\nTyrion wanted you to be Queen of the seven kingdoms. </p><p>\u201cWas\nprepared to sacrifice her own life for the people of Kingslanding that weren\u2019t\neven her own\u2026\u201d \u2013 You were so overwhelmed that you took a step closer to Tyrion,\nstanding next to Bran. \u2013 \u201cIn the many times I\u2019ve encountered Y/n she kept\nsurprising me with her determination and bravery\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tyrion now spoke to the\nother lords and Ladies as Sansa bit her lip, looking not very pleased with the\noutcome. \u2013 \u201cIf there was someone I would believe in, it would be Y/n the\nvaliant!\u201d \u2013 You gasped soft as Bran had taken your hand and placed a kiss on\nit. </p><p>\u201cY/n can\u2019t\nrule the seven kingdoms?\u201d \u2013 Sansa said as you looked at her. \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s to young\nand Bran can\u2019t bare her children!\u201d \u2013 You gave her a foul look as Bran looked\nthe same at her. \u2013 \u201cGood!\u201d \u2013 Tyrion said, - \u201cChildren of a Queen can be cruel\nand stupid\u2026 as you know all too well\u2026\u201d \u00a0-\nSansa stopped talking as Tyrion had shown her, her place. \u2013 \u201cI believe in her!\u201d\n\u2013 Bran spoke as he looked up to you and smiled. \u2013 \u201cI believe in her too!

You nodded back at her as Bran kissed your hand again. </p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d \u2013\nTyrion asked you as you took some deep breaths. Tyrion then looked at everyone\nelse to see if anyone would protest. \u2013 \u201cI believe we should vote then\u2026\u201d \u2013\nTyrion looked at his left as you held Bran\u2019s hand firm. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 the first\nmen said out loud as it only increased your nerves. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 the second and\nthe third said. It went so on until you reached Sansa, she turned her body\ntowards you as you prepared yourself to hear a no. \u2013 \u201cY/n if you let me\u2026 I want\nthe north to be a free and an independent country\u2026 it has suffered more than\nenough for Westeros!\u201d \u2013 You were surprised by her request, but you understood\nit fully. </p><p>\u201cThe North\nis from this day on an independent country!\u201d \u2013 You called out as Sansa bowed\nher head out of respect to you. You did the same as you held one hand near your\nheart. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 she then said out loud, looking directly at Tyrion. Aria and\nBran also said loud \u2018Aye!\u2019 as only a few more needed to say their vote. The\nrest of the lords and ladies all said \u2018Aye!\u2019 as Tyrion ended his vote with a\nnod. Tyrion then signalled to you as you took some more steps, making yourself\nmore visible for everyone. \u2013 \u201cAll hail Y/n the valiant, First of her name\u2026Queen\nof the Andals and the first men. Lady of the six kingdoms and protector of the\nrealm!\u201d </p><p>It felt\nglorious to hear the title come out of Tyrion\u2019s mouth as he bowed his head in\nrespect of you. Everyone started to clap loud for you as Tyrion smiled at you.\nYou then moved to the back of Bran\u2019s wheelchair as you started to push him\naway, all the others followed you as the council was over. Their Queen had been\nchosen and now they could all return home. You rolled with him in silence past\nTyrion as you paused for a moment. \u2013 \u201cGrey worm! I will make sure Tyrion will\nbe faced with his actions at my council!\u201d \u2013 Grey worm nodded with a forced expression\nas he removed the chains from around Tyrion\u2019s wrists. \u2013 \u201cThank you, My queen!\u201d \u2013\nTyrion said as you nodded at him and continued to walk with Bran to somewhere\nyou could be alone. You leaded him to your tent as Kingslanding needed to be\nrebuild and it was to dangerous now to head into the city. </p><p>You parked\nBran\u2019s wheelchair near your bed as you stretched your back a bit, moving over\nto the mirror stand.

Gold? Flags?\u201d\n\u2013 he shook his head as he looked up to his left. \u2013 \u201cStories\u2026\u201d </p><p>Tyrion kept\nwalking around as he suddenly paused and slowly turned around. \u2013 \u201cAnd who has a\nbetter story than Y/n the valiant!\u201d \u2013 All the lord and ladies\u2019 eyes went\nstraight to you as you lifted your hands up from Bran\u2019s shoulder out of shock.\nSansa and Arya looked at you with shock as Tyrion kept looking directly at you.\n\u2013 \u201cLost both of her parents in the war\u2026 Survived for many years alone\u2026 helped\nBrandon Stark on his journey beyond the wall\u2026\u201d \u2013 Everyone kept looking at you\nas Tyrion kept telling everyone your life\u2019s story. \u2013 \u201cShowed more bravery then\nanyone I know\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tyrion nodded soft at you as you still couldn\u2019t believe that\nTyrion wanted you to be Queen of the seven kingdoms. </p><p>\u201cWas\nprepared to sacrifice her own life for the people of Kingslanding that weren\u2019t\neven her own\u2026\u201d \u2013 You were so overwhelmed that you took a step closer to Tyrion,\nstanding next to Bran. \u2013 \u201cIn the many times I\u2019ve encountered Y/n she kept\nsurprising me with her determination and bravery\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tyrion now spoke to the\nother lords and Ladies as Sansa bit her lip, looking not very pleased with the\noutcome. \u2013 \u201cIf there was someone I would believe in, it would be Y/n the\nvaliant!\u201d \u2013 You gasped soft as Bran had taken your hand and placed a kiss on\nit. </p><p>\u201cY/n can\u2019t\nrule the seven kingdoms?\u201d \u2013 Sansa said as you looked at her. \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s to young\nand Bran can\u2019t bare her children!\u201d \u2013 You gave her a foul look as Bran looked\nthe same at her. \u2013 \u201cGood!\u201d \u2013 Tyrion said, - \u201cChildren of a Queen can be cruel\nand stupid\u2026 as you know all too well\u2026\u201d \u00a0-\nSansa stopped talking as Tyrion had shown her, her place. \u2013 \u201cI believe in her!\u201d\n\u2013 Bran spoke as he looked up to you and smiled. \u2013 \u201cI believe in her too!

You nodded back at her as Bran kissed your hand again. </p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d \u2013\nTyrion asked you as you took some deep breaths. Tyrion then looked at everyone\nelse to see if anyone would protest. \u2013 \u201cI believe we should vote then\u2026\u201d \u2013\nTyrion looked at his left as you held Bran\u2019s hand firm. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 the first\nmen said out loud as it only increased your nerves. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 the second and\nthe third said. It went so on until you reached Sansa, she turned her body\ntowards you as you prepared yourself to hear a no. \u2013 \u201cY/n if you let me\u2026 I want\nthe north to be a free and an independent country\u2026 it has suffered more than\nenough for Westeros!\u201d \u2013 You were surprised by her request, but you understood\nit fully. </p><p>\u201cThe North\nis from this day on an independent country!\u201d \u2013 You called out as Sansa bowed\nher head out of respect to you. You did the same as you held one hand near your\nheart. \u2013 \u201cAye!\u201d \u2013 she then said out loud, looking directly at Tyrion. Aria and\nBran also said loud \u2018Aye!\u2019 as only a few more needed to say their vote. The\nrest of the lords and ladies all said \u2018Aye!\u2019 as Tyrion ended his vote with a\nnod. Tyrion then signalled to you as you took some more steps, making yourself\nmore visible for everyone. \u2013 \u201cAll hail Y/n the valiant, First of her name\u2026Queen\nof the Andals and the first men. Lady of the six kingdoms and protector of the\nrealm!\u201d </p><p>It felt\nglorious to hear the title come out of Tyrion\u2019s mouth as he bowed his head in\nrespect of you. Everyone started to clap loud for you as Tyrion smiled at you.\nYou then moved to the back of Bran\u2019s wheelchair as you started to push him\naway, all the others followed you as the council was over. Their Queen had been\nchosen and now they could all return home. You rolled with him in silence past\nTyrion as you paused for a moment. \u2013 \u201cGrey worm! I will make sure Tyrion will\nbe faced with his actions at my council!\u201d \u2013 Grey worm nodded with a forced expression\nas he removed the chains from around Tyrion\u2019s wrists. \u2013 \u201cThank you, My queen!\u201d \u2013\nTyrion said as you nodded at him and continued to walk with Bran to somewhere\nyou could be alone. You leaded him to your tent as Kingslanding needed to be\nrebuild and it was to dangerous now to head into the city. </p><p>You parked\nBran\u2019s wheelchair near your bed as you stretched your back a bit, moving over\nto the mirror stand. Bran pulled himself a bit up by his arms as he wanted to\nsit down on your bed. You noticed him struggling as you came to his aid. \u2013 \u201cYou\njust should have asked!\u201d \u2013 you said to him as you grabbed his legs and placed\nthem on the bed. \u2013 \u201cAnd let my Queen do all the work?\u201d \u2013 he joked as you slightly\nshook your head. \u2013 \u201cI still can\u2019t believe everyone voted for me to be Queen of\nthe six kingdoms?\u201d \u2013 You had placed Bran in the best position for him to sit as\nyou came sitting next to him with a deep exhale. \u2013 \u201cYou will be wonderful!\u201d \u2013\nhe replied as he suddenly grabbed your waist and let himself fall. </p><p>You fell on\ntop of Bran as you squealed loud. \u2013 \u201cBrandon!\u201d \u2013 you laughed out as he still\nhad his arms around you. You slowly lifted your head to look at him better as\nhe moved some hair of yours behind your ear. \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for\nsuch a big responsibility, Brandon\u2026\u201d \u2013 you said to him in a vulnerable tone as\nyou looked away from him. \u2013 \u201cY/n I know for a fact that you will be the best\nqueen, you are kind, strong, wise and most importantly mine\u2026\u201d \u2013 Bran forced you\nto smile as he ticked you soft. \u2013 \u201cYou truly believe in me?\u201d \u2013 Bran nodded deep\nas you were leaning against his chest, fumbling a piece of his shirt. </p><p>Bran then\npulled your body more down to reach for your lips as he pressed his lips gently\nonto yours. You slowly moved your hands to his neck as you kept kissing him\nrepeatedly. Bran then rolled you over to your side so that you were laying next\nto him. You removed your lips from him and wrapped your arms around him,\nplacing your head on his shoulder. Bran also wrapped his arms around you as he kept\ncuddling with you. \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t even have a throne?\u201d \u2013 you suddenly called out as\nyou pulled your head up. Bran sighed soft as he placed your head down again and\nlet his fingers play with yours. \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ll build you a new one\u2026 a better one!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne\nwithout the creepy swords?\u201d \u2013 You asked him as Bran hummed deep. \u2013 \u201cWithout the\nswords.\u201d \u2013 he then kissed the top of your head as you placed your head better\non his chest. \u2013 \u201cYou know me being Queen makes you kind of my King?\u201d \u2013 you waited\nfor a moment because you knew Bran never had any intentions of becoming King of\nanything. \u2013 \u201cI would be honoured to be by your side Y/n\u2026\u201d \u2013 he replied after a while\nas you lifted your head up again. \u2013 \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re not abandoning me for being Queen?\u201d\n\u2013 Bran gave you a quick shocked expression that you would think like that. \u2013 \u201cY/n\nI love you more than anything, I would never leave you not even when you are\nQueen now\u2026 I would love to be your King even though I can\u2019t give you any\nchildren\u2026.\u201d \u2013 You moved your hand to his cheek as you looked him into his eyes.\n\u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want them\u2026 just you\u2026\u201d \u2013 you then pressed your lips again onto his as\nyou felt him wrap his arms around you better. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\n\nCheck out my <b><a href=\"https://frost-queen.tumblr.com/post/175583277876/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></b> for more Game of thrones fics<br></p>",

Sam Tarly cleared his throat as everyone looked at him in silence. &ndash;\n&ldquo;Why just us?&rdquo; &ndash; you frowned deep as Sam got up from his seat, nervously. &ndash; &ldquo;We\nrepresent all the great houses but whoever we choose won&rsquo;t just rule over lords\nand ladies&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; You listened closely as Sam was indeed right. &ndash; &ldquo;Maybe the\ndecision about what&rsquo;s best for everyone should be left to &hellip; oh&hellip; well everyone?&rdquo;\n&ndash; Immediately started several ladies and lords to chuckle quietly as they\ndidn&rsquo;t want to hear another word of this strange request from Sam.</p><p>As everyone\nwas looking at each other some lords started to laugh loud at his silly\nrequest. &ndash; &ldquo;Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well!&rdquo; &ndash; Bran&rsquo;s uncle\nlaughed out as everyone was laughing at Sam. Sam smiled faintly as he tried to\nhide his sadness and seated himself quickly down. &ndash; &ldquo;Should I ask my horse?&rdquo; &ndash;\nthe old lord laughed out as you had enough of their laughter. &ndash; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nenough!&rdquo; &ndash; you called out in a calm but powerful tone as they suddenly stopped\nlaughing. &ndash; &ldquo;I suppose you want the crown?&rdquo; &ndash; Bran&rsquo;s uncle asked Tyrion as\nTyrion was looking down in a humble way. &ndash; &ldquo;Me? The imp?&rdquo; &ndash; he shook his head\nas you felt like there was no progress. &ndash; &ldquo;Half of the people hate me for\nserving Daenerys, the other half hates me for betraying her&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Tyrion then\nbriefly looked at Grey Worm who still stood in his soldier position. </p><p>&ldquo;Who then?&rdquo;\n&ndash; Sir Davos spoke as Tyrion took a deep breath. &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had nothing else to do\nbut think these past few weeks&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Tyrion started again, - &ldquo;about our bloody\nhistory!&rdquo; &ndash; He looked brief at his right as he continued, - &ldquo;About the mistakes\nwe&rsquo;ve made&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; He looked again brief at Grey worm who rejected his apologetic\nexpression as Tyrion suddenly looked in front of him at you. &ndash; &ldquo;What unites\npeople?&rdquo; &ndash; he spoke again as he started to walk around. &ndash; &ldquo;Armies? Gold? Flags?&rdquo;\n&ndash; he shook his head as he looked up to his left. &ndash; &ldquo;Stories&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Tyrion kept\nwalking around as he suddenly paused and slowly turned around. &ndash; &ldquo;And who has a\nbetter story than Y/n the valiant!&rdquo; &ndash; All the lord and ladies&rsquo; eyes went\nstraight to you as you lifted your hands up from Bran&rsquo;s shoulder out of shock.\nSansa and Arya looked at you with shock as Tyrion kept looking directly at you.\n&ndash; &ldquo;Lost both of her parents in the war&hellip; Survived for many years alone&hellip; helped\nBrandon Stark on his journey beyond the wall&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Everyone kept looking at you\nas Tyrion kept telling everyone your life&rsquo;s story. &ndash; &ldquo;Showed more bravery then\nanyone I know&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Tyrion nodded soft at you as you still couldn&rsquo;t believe that\nTyrion wanted you to be Queen of the seven kingdoms. </p><p>&ldquo;Was\nprepared to sacrifice her own life for the people of Kingslanding that weren&rsquo;t\neven her own&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; You were so overwhelmed that you took a step closer to Tyrion,\nstanding next to Bran. &ndash; &ldquo;In the many times I&rsquo;ve encountered Y/n she kept\nsurprising me with her determination and bravery&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Tyrion now spoke to the\nother lords and Ladies as Sansa bit her lip, looking not very pleased with the\noutcome. &ndash; &ldquo;If there was someone I would believe in, it would be Y/n the\nvaliant!&rdquo; &ndash; You gasped soft as Bran had taken your hand and placed a kiss on\nit. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n can&rsquo;t\nrule the seven kingdoms?&rdquo; &ndash; Sansa said as you looked at her. &ndash; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s to young\nand Bran can&rsquo;t bare her children!&rdquo; &ndash; You gave her a foul look as Bran looked\nthe same at her. &ndash; &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; &ndash; Tyrion said, - &ldquo;Children of a Queen can be cruel\nand stupid&hellip; as you know all too well&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;-\nSansa stopped talking as Tyrion had shown her, her place. &ndash; &ldquo;I believe in her!&rdquo;\n&ndash; Bran spoke as he looked up to you and smiled. &ndash; &ldquo;I believe in her too! She\nwill be a great queen that will value the voice of her people!&rdquo; &ndash; Arya said as\nshe nodded at you. You nodded back at her as Bran kissed your hand again. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; &ndash;\nTyrion asked you as you took some deep breaths. Tyrion then looked at everyone\nelse to see if anyone would protest. &ndash; &ldquo;I believe we should vote then&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash;\nTyrion looked at his left as you held Bran&rsquo;s hand firm. &ndash; &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; &ndash; the first\nmen said out loud as it only increased your nerves. &ndash; &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; &ndash; the second and\nthe third said. It went so on until you reached Sansa, she turned her body\ntowards you as you prepared yourself to hear a no. &ndash; &ldquo;Y/n if you let me&hellip; I want\nthe north to be a free and an independent country&hellip; it has suffered more than\nenough for Westeros!&rdquo; &ndash; You were surprised by her request, but you understood\nit fully. </p><p>&ldquo;The North\nis from this day on an independent country!&rdquo; &ndash; You called out as Sansa bowed\nher head out of respect to you. You did the same as you held one hand near your\nheart. &ndash; &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; &ndash; she then said out loud, looking directly at Tyrion. Aria and\nBran also said loud &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; as only a few more needed to say their vote. The\nrest of the lords and ladies all said &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; as Tyrion ended his vote with a\nnod. Tyrion then signalled to you as you took some more steps, making yourself\nmore visible for everyone. &ndash; &ldquo;All hail Y/n the valiant, First of her name&hellip;Queen\nof the Andals and the first men. Lady of the six kingdoms and protector of the\nrealm!&rdquo; </p><p>It felt\nglorious to hear the title come out of Tyrion&rsquo;s mouth as he bowed his head in\nrespect of you. Everyone started to clap loud for you as Tyrion smiled at you.\nYou then moved to the back of Bran&rsquo;s wheelchair as you started to push him\naway, all the others followed you as the council was over. Their Queen had been\nchosen and now they could all return home. You rolled with him in silence past\nTyrion as you paused for a moment. &ndash; &ldquo;Grey worm! I will make sure Tyrion will\nbe faced with his actions at my council!&rdquo; &ndash; Grey worm nodded with a forced expression\nas he removed the chains from around Tyrion&rsquo;s wrists. &ndash; &ldquo;Thank you, My queen!&rdquo; &ndash;\nTyrion said as you nodded at him and continued to walk with Bran to somewhere\nyou could be alone. You leaded him to your tent as Kingslanding needed to be\nrebuild and it was to dangerous now to head into the city. </p><p>You parked\nBran&rsquo;s wheelchair near your bed as you stretched your back a bit, moving over\nto the mirror stand. Bran pulled himself a bit up by his arms as he wanted to\nsit down on your bed. You noticed him struggling as you came to his aid. &ndash; &ldquo;You\njust should have asked!&rdquo; &ndash; you said to him as you grabbed his legs and placed\nthem on the bed. &ndash; &ldquo;And let my Queen do all the work?&rdquo; &ndash; he joked as you slightly\nshook your head. &ndash; &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe everyone voted for me to be Queen of\nthe six kingdoms?&rdquo; &ndash; You had placed Bran in the best position for him to sit as\nyou came sitting next to him with a deep exhale. &ndash; &ldquo;You will be wonderful!&rdquo; &ndash;\nhe replied as he suddenly grabbed your waist and let himself fall. </p><p>You fell on\ntop of Bran as you squealed loud. &ndash; &ldquo;Brandon!&rdquo; &ndash; you laughed out as he still\nhad his arms around you. You slowly lifted your head to look at him better as\nhe moved some hair of yours behind your ear. &ndash; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready for\nsuch a big responsibility, Brandon&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; you said to him in a vulnerable tone as\nyou looked away from him. &ndash; &ldquo;Y/n I know for a fact that you will be the best\nqueen, you are kind, strong, wise and most importantly mine&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Bran forced you\nto smile as he ticked you soft. &ndash; &ldquo;You truly believe in me?&rdquo; &ndash; Bran nodded deep\nas you were leaning against his chest, fumbling a piece of his shirt. </p><p>Bran then\npulled your body more down to reach for your lips as he pressed his lips gently\nonto yours. You slowly moved your hands to his neck as you kept kissing him\nrepeatedly. Bran then rolled you over to your side so that you were laying next\nto him. You removed your lips from him and wrapped your arms around him,\nplacing your head on his shoulder. Bran also wrapped his arms around you as he kept\ncuddling with you. &ndash; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even have a throne?&rdquo; &ndash; you suddenly called out as\nyou pulled your head up. Bran sighed soft as he placed your head down again and\nlet his fingers play with yours. &ndash; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll build you a new one&hellip; a better one!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;One\nwithout the creepy swords?&rdquo; &ndash; You asked him as Bran hummed deep. &ndash; &ldquo;Without the\nswords.&rdquo; &ndash; he then kissed the top of your head as you placed your head better\non his chest. &ndash; &ldquo;You know me being Queen makes you kind of my King?&rdquo; &ndash; you waited\nfor a moment because you knew Bran never had any intentions of becoming King of\nanything. &ndash; &ldquo;I would be honoured to be by your side Y/n&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; he replied after a while\nas you lifted your head up again. &ndash; &ldquo;So&hellip; you&rsquo;re not abandoning me for being Queen?&rdquo;\n&ndash; Bran gave you a quick shocked expression that you would think like that. &ndash; &ldquo;Y/n\nI love you more than anything, I would never leave you not even when you are\nQueen now&hellip; I would love to be your King even though I can&rsquo;t give you any\nchildren&hellip;.&rdquo; &ndash; You moved your hand to his cheek as you looked him into his eyes.\n&ndash; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them&hellip; just you&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; you then pressed your lips again onto his as\nyou felt him wrap his arms around you better. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\n\nCheck out my <b><a href=\"https://frost-queen.tumblr.com/post/175583277876/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></b> for more Game of thrones fics<br /></p>",

Grey worm was standing in front of them in the sun\nwith Tyrion by his side, with chains around his wrists. It was an intense\nmoment as you inhaled deep, softly pushing your fingers deeper into Bran&rsquo;s\nshoulder. Tyrion looked brief at Grey worm before he started to speak. &ndash; &ldquo;Jon&rsquo;s\nfaith is to be decided by our king&hellip; or queen.&rdquo; &ndash; Tyrion then looked humble at\neach and everyone of them as a lord sitting next to Lord Arryn spoke. &ndash; &ldquo;We\ndon&rsquo;t have a king or queen?&rdquo; &ndash; Tyrion softly nodded with his head as he smiled\nfaintly. &ndash; &ldquo;You are all the most powerful people in Westeros&hellip; choose one&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Tyrion\nlooked up to Grey worm who exhaled deep, keeping his face in a firm expression.\n&ndash; &ldquo;Make your choice then!&rdquo; &ndash; You could hear at the tone of Grey worm&rsquo;s voice\nthat he rather had Jon be executed for his actions right now. Another moment of\nsilence broke free as everyone looked at each other without moving a bit. The\ntension was nerve-racking as you grabbed Bran&rsquo;s shoulder even tighter. Your\nmuscles relaxed a bit as you felt Bran&rsquo;s hand touch yours that laid on his\nshoulder. Sansa made some eye contact with Yara beside her as Brienne of Tarth\nlooked brief at you. Suddenly the Stark&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s chair cracked as he got up\nand stepped closer into the middle. </p>\n</p>",

What was baby Bran's opinion on vegetables, did he feel menaced by them like Arya did? Did they ever try to sneak out of winterfell? Did they have adventures in the Godswood? Did they share a nursery before Arya moved to Sansa's room?",

Possibly, I got my little brother to play dress-up and most children enjoy playing with dolls (legos and toy cars are, by all means, dolls).
