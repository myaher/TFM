        "answer": "<p><b>REQUESTED READING:</b> BTS </p><p>Date: 12/02/19; Time: 9:30 am; Tea: Earl Grey</p><p>Disclaimer: Tasseography is a very intuitive practice, like all areas of divination, so this is simply what I see and the meaning it holds for me.</p><p>I use (s) (m) (b) to indicate the size/importance of something within the cup. (s) = small. (m) = medium. (b) = big. And the reading itself is split into two sections - the symbols painted within the cup (which are more general), and the signs I see myself (which are more personal and specific).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"294\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d38c658061972a46233285d3372d8a8/tumblr_inline_pmxh7gv8xM1viv3y5_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"294\"/></figure><p><b>THE RIM SYMBOLS (near future, up to ten days in the future):</b></p><p><b>[HEART]</b> (b) This is the rim symbol with the most significance for bts. Hearts indicate love and affectionate relationships - and the strengthening of those relationships. Hearts are also representative of a person\u2019s home and/or home life.</p><p><b>[CUP] </b>(m) Celebrations, social invitations, and enjoyment are on the cards. This could be a cosy get together with friends or something more \u2018official\u2019 - like award shows, events etc.</p><p><b>[STAR] </b>(m) Stars shine brightly, like those favoured by this symbol. It\u2019s representative of successful projects, recognition, and praise. All of that hard work is about to be rewarded.</p><p><b>THE INNER CIRCLE (larger themes, for the coming weeks and months):</b></p><p><b>[MARS]</b> (b) Mars is symbolic of energy, action, and assertiveness. It\u2019s all about the doing. It\u2019s about getting things done and/or finalised.</p><p><b>[JUPITER] </b>(b) Jupiter brings good luck and good fortune. The universe is on bangtan\u2019s side at the moment. Heart-warming encounters are likely to significantly brighten their lives on a day-to-day basis. As will long-distance friendships, which consistently broaden their horizons and benefit them emotionally. </p><p><b>[SUN] </b>(m) People who have the sun in their cups are capable of making positive impressions on the circumstances and people around them. As a symbol it brings with it joy, creativity, and success. These people are mood-makers.</p><p><b>[MOON] </b>(m) \u00a0Innermost feelings and intimate relationships will be important at this time. This symbol asks them to pay particular attention to their dreams (literal dreams) and their feelings and intuition.</p><p><b>WHAT THE LEAVES SAY (symbols and signs I saw in the cup):</b></p><p><b>[CROWN]</b> (b) Success, honour, and the recognition of talents are all on the horizon for bangtan. This is a very good omen for them individually and as a group - in fact, it\u2019s a very positive and reassuring symbol in general. </p><p>Because of its relationship to the head, the crown is a sign connected to how they view the world and how they feel about their place in it. So, it\u2019s very possible that they feel like the \u2018Kings of the World\u2019 in some sense. This<i> could</i> sound arrogant but it really shouldn\u2019t - kings carry a lot of weight on their shoulders, it\u2019s certainly a lot of responsibility, and those with a crown in their tea cup know this all too well. But it\u2019s important to remember that this symbol suggests a sense of authority and the urge to lead others - no one has forced them into this life, they want and desire to be the best that they can be. They want to be kings - trials, tribulations, and all.</p><p>Significantly, the sign\u2019s bottom positioning warns bangtan against those around them who don\u2019t wear the crown themselves but still try and control it (-issues of control have come up in several of my bangtan readings, so I always consider them very important pieces in their overall picture). There may be a few struggles coming up for them in this regard - after all, kings never rule without trouble and/or contention - but it\u2019s nothing for them to worry about in the long run - in the end, the crown is still symbolic of supremacy and ascendance. They\u2019re always moving forward and upwards, and this should lead them to the attainment of their \u2018highest ambitions\u2019. \u00a0(*tiny yoongi voice* GRAMMY?)</p><p><b>[FLAG] </b>(b) Flags are about personal values - someone\u2019s \u2018colour\u2019, if you will - and how this ties into their identity and the development of their identity. But they\u2019re also about <i>actual</i> countries (usually the birth/home country), and the ways that this country intertwines with the sense of self. So, this is bangtan\u2019s cup emphasising the fact that they\u2019re very specifically <i>Korean</i> artists, as well as artists. </p><p>The sign\u2019s lower position offers bangtan another warning (as with the crown)- this time against negativity. Waving their flag with pride draws a lot of attention and that, of course, can nurture jealousy and spite in others. The suggestion here is to ignore the haters as much as possible and to keep waving their flag proudly. After all, every person has power over their own identity - and that stretches to how they present it to the world. They shouldn\u2019t be discouraged.</p><p>The flag is also, very specifically, a message for them about their reputations. It asks them to be very wary of those with \u2018negative reputations\u2019 and those who may become bad influences in their lives. This omen is urging them to remember that these kinds of people will not only impact <i>them</i> negatively but \u2018spoil\u2019 their public image. It asks them to be very careful. Which makes a lot of sense, I\u2019m sure that many people want to be a part of their lives right now, and they won\u2019t all be \u2018good\u2019 or have good intentions.</p><p><b>[MOOSE]</b> (b) Symbolic of strength, pride, self-esteem, courage, confidence, primal feminine energy, and life itself. Bangtan are focused/interested in finding the truth and finding guidance, for themselves and for others. </p><p>People with a moose in their cup frequently deal with oppositions and opposites. They may have many contrasting thoughts, and face many contrasting situations. Kind of like the moose itself - it\u2019s clumsy but it\u2019s graceful, it\u2019s weird looking but it\u2019s still beautiful. And bangtan have experienced / are experiencing / will experience many thing that seem to contradict one another. This is simply how their lives are. It may be confusing for them sometimes, or even shocking, but in the end it\u2019ll all make sense. They\u2019ll start to understand that these oppositions and opposites are not so far apart but actually elements of the same thing. Something looking odd, or something looking beautiful\u2026 it\u2019s all just about perception and aesthetics. So, this moose encourages them to have pride in <i>everything; </i>in absolutely all of their achievements (whether that\u2019s \u2018I made a great meal today\u2019, or \u2018I sold a million records\u2019), it\u2019s all important. And that sense of joy that achieving things brings to them, no matter how small it is, should be shared and basked in. There\u2019s nothing wrong with indulging in good feelings.</p><p>Moose are strong, powerful creatures - meaning that this sign is also symbolic of those who move forward powerfully. Particularly with companions. It\u2019s about the strength of togetherness and solidarity. It\u2019s about adaptability and endurance. In this sense, it\u2019s a wonderful omen for their relationship at present and in the future. And bangtan should definitely be focused on the future right now. In fact, this moose encourages them to dream big, to look at the present, to observe their current reality, and to not dwell on the things they experienced in the past, especially those things that they may have \u2018lost\u2019. They should stay focused on the now, take stock of it, and move on. The past is done. It\u2019s finished.</p><p>Following on nicely from that little message of togetherness is the moose and its message of love. In a cup, a moose encourages all kinds of love and the creation of an atmosphere that not only attracts love but allows it to flourish. And, for long standing relationships in particular, it\u2019s an incredible sign of commitment and promises made. The love that bangtan share for one another is here to stay, even when time passes and the limelight fades.</p><p>The final message of the moose is one of control. It wants bangtan to know that they - and <i>only</i> they - control their own lives. (see, I told you that this comes up a lot. Some of them <i>really</i> do seem to worry about this quite a bit.) This sign reminds them that they have <i>absolute authority</i> over themselves - as individuals and as a unit. On a personal level, their cup promises them that they never <i>ever</i> have to feel ashamed or pressured - by their friends or by their peers especially. If what they choose for themselves - as individuals or as a group - is different from what others expect / want / need / choose then so be it. They need to stand strong, they need to recognise that their difference is actually a strength (kind of like the opposition thing I was talking about earlier). They should take pride in that difference and always be true to themselves. It\u2019s clich\u00e9, but anyone who matters will support them - both individually and as a group. And, if you have the support of the people that you care about, then the rest is far less important in the grand scheme of things.</p><p><b>[HILL] </b>(m) Gentle challenges lie ahead but they\u2019re the kind of challenges that result in pleasure, wisdom, and a lasting sense of achievement. Higher attainment is possible and success is almost certain. Their hill, whatever it is, will simply be overcome and they will move on. </p><p>Because this sign was near the bottom of their tea cup it argues that they still have quite a journey to undertake before they fulfil their absolute, full potential (which is both scary and impressive). All they have to do is keep working hard. Those ups and downs are not as big as they once were - hills are much more manageable than mountains - and they\u2019re strong enough to journey as far as they want to. Which, in terms of their creativity and their careers, is a beautiful sign. If they put in the hard work, then they\u2019re almost guaranteed great results. </p><p><b>[BOW TIE]</b> (m) In a tea cup, any form of bow is a happy and fortunate symbol. Often they indicate special gifts, or events that are associated with anniversaries or special achievements. While ties are representative of a person\u2019s sense of obligation and/or responsibility. So, it\u2019s very likely that bangtan feel obliged to be good, helpful, considerate influences - both for each other and for the wider world.</p><p>Unfortunately, because of their insistence on being so responsible and polite, there\u2019s a chance that they extend their respect to people they <i>know </i>don\u2019t respect them back. At all. This can, obviously, be discouraging for them. But the tie in their cup suggests that they wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Showing a blatant lack of respect is just not a part of who they are, or who they feel they want to be / need to be - for themselves and for others. </p><p>While the bow tie itself, as you can probably guess, points to important events, honours, and great prestige.</p><p><b>[FISH] </b>(m) Fish are largely about wisdom and knowledge. Now, and in the future, bangtan are in a position to teach others and / or they\u2019re in a position to learn something valuable from others.</p><p>Over the upcoming months they should pay particular attention to their dreams (their literal dreams) and their daydreams. Their intuitive gifts and feelings are strong at the moment and the things that they dream up could be <i>very</i> important for them. Overall, this should be a time for the healing and purification of bangtan\u2019s subconscious - a clearing out of old thoughts and a healing of old wounds etc.</p><p>Again (!), a fish can indicate a struggle for independence and / or control. But the overall message here is a very positive one and it <i>should</i> be treated as such. Bangtan can overcome anything and achieve anything, as long as they push themselves to their limits. Luck is with them right now and their lives are full of abundance.</p><p>Of course, fish are also symbolic of pieces people and pieces energy - meaning that Yoongi may have a lot of sway over bangtan in general, both at the moment and throughout the year. This could take any form - the general mood, at home, at work, creatively. If this is the case, then how this year turns out for them could be significantly influenced by Yoongi and his energy. And like I said, that\u2019s not necessarily a \u2018major\u2019 thing that we\u2019ll see as spectators, but it\u2019s important to them as a group. </p><p><b>[DINOSAUR]</b> (m) The last time I saw a dinosaur it was in Taehyung\u2019s cup and it was a cute diplodocus. This time it\u2019s in bangtan\u2019s cup and it\u2019s a cute pterodactyl. The same general message applies. There needs to be an updating of old views and old opinions - of the world, of themselves, of whatever it is. Old attitudes are old news and they do nobody any favours, often bringing with them unnecessary negativity. The prevailing message is one of adapting and evolving, of not been stuck in the past, where they\u2019re doomed and facing extinction.With a little persistence they can flourish in their new forms. They just need to think flexibly and learn to trust in themselves.</p><p>Again (!!), there is the message that they are free to decide their own future. Their efforts won\u2019t go to waste \u00a0- especially when they work with others (i.e. each other).</p><p>Because of the other signs in this cup, and those found in their previous group cup, these \u2018old views\u2019 and \u2018old opinions\u2019 probably relate to their understandings of themselves. But, whatever it is, it\u2019s time for them to let it go and move on. </p><p>Because of the mid-position of the dinosaur it also suggests that someone in bangtan may be battling some form of involuntary behaviour. As I said in Tae\u2019s cup (because his was similarly positioned), I have no idea what this is or what it could be but - if this is the case - then effort is being put in to overcome it. \u00a0</p><p><b>OTHER SIGNS: </b></p><p>There are two other things I wanted to make note of for bangtan and their cup. First, the significant presence of bubbles. When you pour tea for a reading sometimes bubbles linger on the surface, this is a sign that money is on its way. There were <i>a lot</i> of lingering bubbles for them. So, you guessed it, this is that reminder that they\u2019re all filthy rich and getting richer, I bet you thought we\u2019d escaped it this time but you were wrong, it was <i>literally</i> the first thing to happen! </p><p>The second thing I wanted to draw attention to is the [CUP] rim symbol - I think you can see it in the picture actually - there\u2019s the roman numeral for 4 (IV)? It kind of merges over onto the [STAR]. This seemed important to me, and it\u2019s quite big too. So, we shouldn\u2019t ignore it. I felt like it was related to the fourth month (April) - suggesting that this period of time is a time of significant upcoming celebrations [CUP] and recognition [STAR] for them. A new album in April maybe?? \u00a0Also, those bubbles I just mentioned were positioned near the end of the third month (March) and the beginning of the fourth (April) \u00a0- if you approach the cup\u2019s rim as a clock/calendar. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening for them around then, obviously. But it\u2019s very good, whatever it is - they\u2019ll be feeling joyful, they\u2019ll be heavily praised, and there will be a lot of money involved. Take it how you want to. It might not be something we even see but it very well could be!</p><p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b></p><p>This reading was so easy. Seriously, I could probably read for them in my sleep. The symbols and signs just leap out. I decided to do this just after their Grammy appearance because their energy was so good and I was feeling it overall. </p><p>Bangtan seem to be feeling very good at the moment (hello, kings?) and, for me, there is a sense that they\u2019re on the cusp of clearing out all of their old thoughts about themselves as individuals and as a group. There\u2019s also love, respect, pride, and the desire to be a good influence - both for themselves and for others. </p><p>There were a few warning signs - about bad influences and negativity - and the whole \u2018controlling my own destiny\u2019 thing is still alive and kicking. But, overall, this<i> </i>was such a positive cup. Filled with possibilities.</p><p>To answer your questions, Anon. If they work hard together then they can literally achieve <i>anything </i>including, dare I say it\u2026. that grammy. They have luck on their side and they have each other. They\u2019re old hands at overcoming and they\u2019re apparently not even close to their full potential (wow). So, I really doubt that this is the peak for them. It\u2019s all <i>good</i>. If they want it, and they keep working hard, the sky\u2019s the limit.</p><p>Thank you for asking for this and for your sweet message!\u00a0</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dailyjeons:v1CIca9C09ckRn4ZoHqaVw:Zs1jsd2gBQokm\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67e78b88b7e1a77b1b7240d1146aaa9f/tumblr_pmqy3zk5lH1wq9bfzo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\"/></figure>",

Hearts indicate love and affectionate relationships - and the strengthening of those relationships. Hearts are also representative of a person\u2019s home and/or home life.</p><p><b>[CUP] </b>(m) Celebrations, social invitations, and enjoyment are on the cards. This could be a cosy get together with friends or something more \u2018official\u2019 - like award shows, events etc.</p><p><b>[STAR] </b>(m) Stars shine brightly, like those favoured by this symbol. It\u2019s representative of successful projects, recognition, and praise. All of that hard work is about to be rewarded.</p><p><b>THE INNER CIRCLE (larger themes, for the coming weeks and months):</b></p><p><b>[MARS]</b> (b) Mars is symbolic of energy, action, and assertiveness. It\u2019s all about the doing. It\u2019s about getting things done and/or finalised.</p><p><b>[JUPITER] </b>(b) Jupiter brings good luck and good fortune. The universe is on bangtan\u2019s side at the moment. Heart-warming encounters are likely to significantly brighten their lives on a day-to-day basis. As will long-distance friendships, which consistently broaden their horizons and benefit them emotionally. </p><p><b>[SUN] </b>(m) People who have the sun in their cups are capable of making positive impressions on the circumstances and people around them. As a symbol it brings with it joy, creativity, and success. These people are mood-makers.</p><p><b>[MOON] </b>(m) \u00a0Innermost feelings and intimate relationships will be important at this time. This symbol asks them to pay particular attention to their dreams (literal dreams) and their feelings and intuition.</p><p><b>WHAT THE LEAVES SAY (symbols and signs I saw in the cup):</b></p><p><b>[CROWN]</b> (b) Success, honour, and the recognition of talents are all on the horizon for bangtan. This is a very good omen for them individually and as a group - in fact, it\u2019s a very positive and reassuring symbol in general. </p><p>Because of its relationship to the head, the crown is a sign connected to how they view the world and how they feel about their place in it. So, it\u2019s very possible that they feel like the \u2018Kings of the World\u2019 in some sense. This<i> could</i> sound arrogant but it really shouldn\u2019t - kings carry a lot of weight on their shoulders, it\u2019s certainly a lot of responsibility, and those with a crown in their tea cup know this all too well. But it\u2019s important to remember that this symbol suggests a sense of authority and the urge to lead others - no one has forced them into this life, they want and desire to be the best that they can be. They want to be kings - trials, tribulations, and all.</p><p>Significantly, the sign\u2019s bottom positioning warns bangtan against those around them who don\u2019t wear the crown themselves but still try and control it (-issues of control have come up in several of my bangtan readings, so I always consider them very important pieces in their overall picture). There may be a few struggles coming up for them in this regard - after all, kings never rule without trouble and/or contention - but it\u2019s nothing for them to worry about in the long run - in the end, the crown is still symbolic of supremacy and ascendance. They\u2019re always moving forward and upwards, and this should lead them to the attainment of their \u2018highest ambitions\u2019. \u00a0(*tiny yoongi voice* GRAMMY?)</p><p><b>[FLAG] </b>(b) Flags are about personal values - someone\u2019s \u2018colour\u2019, if you will - and how this ties into their identity and the development of their identity. But they\u2019re also about <i>actual</i> countries (usually the birth/home country), and the ways that this country intertwines with the sense of self. So, this is bangtan\u2019s cup emphasising the fact that they\u2019re very specifically <i>Korean</i> artists, as well as artists. </p><p>The sign\u2019s lower position offers bangtan another warning (as with the crown)- this time against negativity. Waving their flag with pride draws a lot of attention and that, of course, can nurture jealousy and spite in others. The suggestion here is to ignore the haters as much as possible and to keep waving their flag proudly. After all, every person has power over their own identity - and that stretches to how they present it to the world. They shouldn\u2019t be discouraged.</p><p>The flag is also, very specifically, a message for them about their reputations. It asks them to be very wary of those with \u2018negative reputations\u2019 and those who may become bad influences in their lives. This omen is urging them to remember that these kinds of people will not only impact <i>them</i> negatively but \u2018spoil\u2019 their public image. It asks them to be very careful. Which makes a lot of sense, I\u2019m sure that many people want to be a part of their lives right now, and they won\u2019t all be \u2018good\u2019 or have good intentions.</p><p><b>[MOOSE]</b> (b) Symbolic of strength, pride, self-esteem, courage, confidence, primal feminine energy, and life itself. Bangtan are focused/interested in finding the truth and finding guidance, for themselves and for others. </p><p>People with a moose in their cup frequently deal with oppositions and opposites. They may have many contrasting thoughts, and face many contrasting situations. Kind of like the moose itself - it\u2019s clumsy but it\u2019s graceful, it\u2019s weird looking but it\u2019s still beautiful. And bangtan have experienced / are experiencing / will experience many thing that seem to contradict one another. This is simply how their lives are. It may be confusing for them sometimes, or even shocking, but in the end it\u2019ll all make sense. They\u2019ll start to understand that these oppositions and opposites are not so far apart but actually elements of the same thing. Something looking odd, or something looking beautiful\u2026 it\u2019s all just about perception and aesthetics. So, this moose encourages them to have pride in <i>everything; </i>in absolutely all of their achievements (whether that\u2019s \u2018I made a great meal today\u2019, or \u2018I sold a million records\u2019), it\u2019s all important. And that sense of joy that achieving things brings to them, no matter how small it is, should be shared and basked in. There\u2019s nothing wrong with indulging in good feelings.</p><p>Moose are strong, powerful creatures - meaning that this sign is also symbolic of those who move forward powerfully. Particularly with companions. It\u2019s about the strength of togetherness and solidarity. It\u2019s about adaptability and endurance. In this sense, it\u2019s a wonderful omen for their relationship at present and in the future. And bangtan should definitely be focused on the future right now. In fact, this moose encourages them to dream big, to look at the present, to observe their current reality, and to not dwell on the things they experienced in the past, especially those things that they may have \u2018lost\u2019. They should stay focused on the now, take stock of it, and move on. The past is done. It\u2019s finished.</p><p>Following on nicely from that little message of togetherness is the moose and its message of love. In a cup, a moose encourages all kinds of love and the creation of an atmosphere that not only attracts love but allows it to flourish. And, for long standing relationships in particular, it\u2019s an incredible sign of commitment and promises made. The love that bangtan share for one another is here to stay, even when time passes and the limelight fades.</p><p>The final message of the moose is one of control. It wants bangtan to know that they - and <i>only</i> they - control their own lives. (see, I told you that this comes up a lot. Some of them <i>really</i> do seem to worry about this quite a bit.) This sign reminds them that they have <i>absolute authority</i> over themselves - as individuals and as a unit. On a personal level, their cup promises them that they never <i>ever</i> have to feel ashamed or pressured - by their friends or by their peers especially. If what they choose for themselves - as individuals or as a group - is different from what others expect / want / need / choose then so be it. They need to stand strong, they need to recognise that their difference is actually a strength (kind of like the opposition thing I was talking about earlier). They should take pride in that difference and always be true to themselves. It\u2019s clich\u00e9, but anyone who matters will support them - both individually and as a group. And, if you have the support of the people that you care about, then the rest is far less important in the grand scheme of things.</p><p><b>[HILL] </b>(m) Gentle challenges lie ahead but they\u2019re the kind of challenges that result in pleasure, wisdom, and a lasting sense of achievement. Higher attainment is possible and success is almost certain. Their hill, whatever it is, will simply be overcome and they will move on. </p><p>Because this sign was near the bottom of their tea cup it argues that they still have quite a journey to undertake before they fulfil their absolute, full potential (which is both scary and impressive). All they have to do is keep working hard. Those ups and downs are not as big as they once were - hills are much more manageable than mountains - and they\u2019re strong enough to journey as far as they want to. Which, in terms of their creativity and their careers, is a beautiful sign. If they put in the hard work, then they\u2019re almost guaranteed great results. </p><p><b>[BOW TIE]</b> (m) In a tea cup, any form of bow is a happy and fortunate symbol. Often they indicate special gifts, or events that are associated with anniversaries or special achievements. While ties are representative of a person\u2019s sense of obligation and/or responsibility. So, it\u2019s very likely that bangtan feel obliged to be good, helpful, considerate influences - both for each other and for the wider world.</p><p>Unfortunately, because of their insistence on being so responsible and polite, there\u2019s a chance that they extend their respect to people they <i>know </i>don\u2019t respect them back. At all. This can, obviously, be discouraging for them. But the tie in their cup suggests that they wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Showing a blatant lack of respect is just not a part of who they are, or who they feel they want to be / need to be - for themselves and for others. </p><p>While the bow tie itself, as you can probably guess, points to important events, honours, and great prestige.</p><p><b>[FISH] </b>(m) Fish are largely about wisdom and knowledge. Now, and in the future, bangtan are in a position to teach others and / or they\u2019re in a position to learn something valuable from others.</p><p>Over the upcoming months they should pay particular attention to their dreams (their literal dreams) and their daydreams. Their intuitive gifts and feelings are strong at the moment and the things that they dream up could be <i>very</i> important for them. Overall, this should be a time for the healing and purification of bangtan\u2019s subconscious - a clearing out of old thoughts and a healing of old wounds etc.</p><p>Again (!), a fish can indicate a struggle for independence and / or control. But the overall message here is a very positive one and it <i>should</i> be treated as such. Bangtan can overcome anything and achieve anything, as long as they push themselves to their limits. Luck is with them right now and their lives are full of abundance.</p><p>Of course, fish are also symbolic of pieces people and pieces energy - meaning that Yoongi may have a lot of sway over bangtan in general, both at the moment and throughout the year. This could take any form - the general mood, at home, at work, creatively. If this is the case, then how this year turns out for them could be significantly influenced by Yoongi and his energy. And like I said, that\u2019s not necessarily a \u2018major\u2019 thing that we\u2019ll see as spectators, but it\u2019s important to them as a group. </p><p><b>[DINOSAUR]</b> (m) The last time I saw a dinosaur it was in Taehyung\u2019s cup and it was a cute diplodocus. This time it\u2019s in bangtan\u2019s cup and it\u2019s a cute pterodactyl. The same general message applies. There needs to be an updating of old views and old opinions - of the world, of themselves, of whatever it is. Old attitudes are old news and they do nobody any favours, often bringing with them unnecessary negativity. The prevailing message is one of adapting and evolving, of not been stuck in the past, where they\u2019re doomed and facing extinction.With a little persistence they can flourish in their new forms. They just need to think flexibly and learn to trust in themselves.</p><p>Again (!!), there is the message that they are free to decide their own future. Their efforts won\u2019t go to waste \u00a0- especially when they work with others (i.e. each other).</p><p>Because of the other signs in this cup, and those found in their previous group cup, these \u2018old views\u2019 and \u2018old opinions\u2019 probably relate to their understandings of themselves. But, whatever it is, it\u2019s time for them to let it go and move on. </p><p>Because of the mid-position of the dinosaur it also suggests that someone in bangtan may be battling some form of involuntary behaviour. As I said in Tae\u2019s cup (because his was similarly positioned), I have no idea what this is or what it could be but - if this is the case - then effort is being put in to overcome it. \u00a0</p><p><b>OTHER SIGNS: </b></p><p>There are two other things I wanted to make note of for bangtan and their cup. First, the significant presence of bubbles. When you pour tea for a reading sometimes bubbles linger on the surface, this is a sign that money is on its way. There were <i>a lot</i> of lingering bubbles for them. So, you guessed it, this is that reminder that they\u2019re all filthy rich and getting richer, I bet you thought we\u2019d escaped it this time but you were wrong, it was <i>literally</i> the first thing to happen! </p><p>The second thing I wanted to draw attention to is the [CUP] rim symbol - I think you can see it in the picture actually - there\u2019s the roman numeral for 4 (IV)? It kind of merges over onto the [STAR]. This seemed important to me, and it\u2019s quite big too. So, we shouldn\u2019t ignore it. I felt like it was related to the fourth month (April) - suggesting that this period of time is a time of significant upcoming celebrations [CUP] and recognition [STAR] for them. A new album in April maybe?? \u00a0Also, those bubbles I just mentioned were positioned near the end of the third month (March) and the beginning of the fourth (April) \u00a0- if you approach the cup\u2019s rim as a clock/calendar. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening for them around then, obviously. But it\u2019s very good, whatever it is - they\u2019ll be feeling joyful, they\u2019ll be heavily praised, and there will be a lot of money involved. Take it how you want to. It might not be something we even see but it very well could be!</p><p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b></p><p>This reading was so easy. Seriously, I could probably read for them in my sleep. The symbols and signs just leap out. I decided to do this just after their Grammy appearance because their energy was so good and I was feeling it overall. </p><p>Bangtan seem to be feeling very good at the moment (hello, kings?) and, for me, there is a sense that they\u2019re on the cusp of clearing out all of their old thoughts about themselves as individuals and as a group. There\u2019s also love, respect, pride, and the desire to be a good influence - both for themselves and for others. </p><p>There were a few warning signs - about bad influences and negativity - and the whole \u2018controlling my own destiny\u2019 thing is still alive and kicking. But, overall, this<i> </i>was such a positive cup. Filled with possibilities.</p><p>To answer your questions, Anon. If they work hard together then they can literally achieve <i>anything </i>including, dare I say it\u2026. that grammy. They have luck on their side and they have each other. They\u2019re old hands at overcoming and they\u2019re apparently not even close to their full potential (wow). So, I really doubt that this is the peak for them. It\u2019s all <i>good</i>. If they want it, and they keep working hard, the sky\u2019s the limit.</p><p>Thank you for asking for this and for your sweet message!\u00a0</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dailyjeons:v1CIca9C09ckRn4ZoHqaVw:Zs1jsd2gBQokm\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67e78b88b7e1a77b1b7240d1146aaa9f/tumblr_pmqy3zk5lH1wq9bfzo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\"></figure></p>",

They\u2019ll start to understand that these oppositions and opposites are not so far apart but actually elements of the same thing. Something looking odd, or something looking beautiful\u2026 it\u2019s all just about perception and aesthetics. So, this moose encourages them to have pride in <i>everything; </i>in absolutely all of their achievements (whether that\u2019s \u2018I made a great meal today\u2019, or \u2018I sold a million records\u2019), it\u2019s all important. And that sense of joy that achieving things brings to them, no matter how small it is, should be shared and basked in. There\u2019s nothing wrong with indulging in good feelings.</p><p>Moose are strong, powerful creatures - meaning that this sign is also symbolic of those who move forward powerfully. Particularly with companions. It\u2019s about the strength of togetherness and solidarity. It\u2019s about adaptability and endurance. In this sense, it\u2019s a wonderful omen for their relationship at present and in the future. And bangtan should definitely be focused on the future right now. In fact, this moose encourages them to dream big, to look at the present, to observe their current reality, and to not dwell on the things they experienced in the past, especially those things that they may have \u2018lost\u2019. They should stay focused on the now, take stock of it, and move on. The past is done. It\u2019s finished.</p><p>Following on nicely from that little message of togetherness is the moose and its message of love. In a cup, a moose encourages all kinds of love and the creation of an atmosphere that not only attracts love but allows it to flourish. And, for long standing relationships in particular, it\u2019s an incredible sign of commitment and promises made. The love that bangtan share for one another is here to stay, even when time passes and the limelight fades.</p><p>The final message of the moose is one of control. It wants bangtan to know that they - and <i>only</i> they - control their own lives. (see, I told you that this comes up a lot. Some of them <i>really</i> do seem to worry about this quite a bit.) This sign reminds them that they have <i>absolute authority</i> over themselves - as individuals and as a unit. On a personal level, their cup promises them that they never <i>ever</i> have to feel ashamed or pressured - by their friends or by their peers especially. If what they choose for themselves - as individuals or as a group - is different from what others expect / want / need / choose then so be it. They need to stand strong, they need to recognise that their difference is actually a strength (kind of like the opposition thing I was talking about earlier). They should take pride in that difference and always be true to themselves. It\u2019s clich\u00e9, but anyone who matters will support them - both individually and as a group. And, if you have the support of the people that you care about, then the rest is far less important in the grand scheme of things.</p><p><b>[HILL] </b>(m) Gentle challenges lie ahead but they\u2019re the kind of challenges that result in pleasure, wisdom, and a lasting sense of achievement. Higher attainment is possible and success is almost certain. Their hill, whatever it is, will simply be overcome and they will move on. </p><p>Because this sign was near the bottom of their tea cup it argues that they still have quite a journey to undertake before they fulfil their absolute, full potential (which is both scary and impressive). All they have to do is keep working hard. Those ups and downs are not as big as they once were - hills are much more manageable than mountains - and they\u2019re strong enough to journey as far as they want to. Which, in terms of their creativity and their careers, is a beautiful sign. If they put in the hard work, then they\u2019re almost guaranteed great results. </p><p><b>[BOW TIE]</b> (m) In a tea cup, any form of bow is a happy and fortunate symbol. Often they indicate special gifts, or events that are associated with anniversaries or special achievements. While ties are representative of a person\u2019s sense of obligation and/or responsibility. So, it\u2019s very likely that bangtan feel obliged to be good, helpful, considerate influences - both for each other and for the wider world.</p><p>Unfortunately, because of their insistence on being so responsible and polite, there\u2019s a chance that they extend their respect to people they <i>know </i>don\u2019t respect them back. At all. This can, obviously, be discouraging for them. But the tie in their cup suggests that they wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Showing a blatant lack of respect is just not a part of who they are, or who they feel they want to be / need to be - for themselves and for others. </p><p>While the bow tie itself, as you can probably guess, points to important events, honours, and great prestige.</p><p><b>[FISH] </b>(m) Fish are largely about wisdom and knowledge. Now, and in the future, bangtan are in a position to teach others and / or they\u2019re in a position to learn something valuable from others.</p><p>Over the upcoming months they should pay particular attention to their dreams (their literal dreams) and their daydreams. Their intuitive gifts and feelings are strong at the moment and the things that they dream up could be <i>very</i> important for them. Overall, this should be a time for the healing and purification of bangtan\u2019s subconscious - a clearing out of old thoughts and a healing of old wounds etc.</p><p>Again (!), a fish can indicate a struggle for independence and / or control. But the overall message here is a very positive one and it <i>should</i> be treated as such. Bangtan can overcome anything and achieve anything, as long as they push themselves to their limits. Luck is with them right now and their lives are full of abundance.</p><p>Of course, fish are also symbolic of pieces people and pieces energy - meaning that Yoongi may have a lot of sway over bangtan in general, both at the moment and throughout the year. This could take any form - the general mood, at home, at work, creatively. If this is the case, then how this year turns out for them could be significantly influenced by Yoongi and his energy. And like I said, that\u2019s not necessarily a \u2018major\u2019 thing that we\u2019ll see as spectators, but it\u2019s important to them as a group. </p><p><b>[DINOSAUR]</b> (m) The last time I saw a dinosaur it was in Taehyung\u2019s cup and it was a cute diplodocus. This time it\u2019s in bangtan\u2019s cup and it\u2019s a cute pterodactyl. The same general message applies. There needs to be an updating of old views and old opinions - of the world, of themselves, of whatever it is. Old attitudes are old news and they do nobody any favours, often bringing with them unnecessary negativity. The prevailing message is one of adapting and evolving, of not been stuck in the past, where they\u2019re doomed and facing extinction.With a little persistence they can flourish in their new forms. They just need to think flexibly and learn to trust in themselves.</p><p>Again (!!), there is the message that they are free to decide their own future. Their efforts won\u2019t go to waste \u00a0- especially when they work with others (i.e. each other).</p><p>Because of the other signs in this cup, and those found in their previous group cup, these \u2018old views\u2019 and \u2018old opinions\u2019 probably relate to their understandings of themselves. But, whatever it is, it\u2019s time for them to let it go and move on. </p><p>Because of the mid-position of the dinosaur it also suggests that someone in bangtan may be battling some form of involuntary behaviour. As I said in Tae\u2019s cup (because his was similarly positioned), I have no idea what this is or what it could be but - if this is the case - then effort is being put in to overcome it. \u00a0</p><p><b>OTHER SIGNS: </b></p><p>There are two other things I wanted to make note of for bangtan and their cup. First, the significant presence of bubbles. When you pour tea for a reading sometimes bubbles linger on the surface, this is a sign that money is on its way. There were <i>a lot</i> of lingering bubbles for them. So, you guessed it, this is that reminder that they\u2019re all filthy rich and getting richer, I bet you thought we\u2019d escaped it this time but you were wrong, it was <i>literally</i> the first thing to happen! </p><p>The second thing I wanted to draw attention to is the [CUP] rim symbol - I think you can see it in the picture actually - there\u2019s the roman numeral for 4 (IV)? It kind of merges over onto the [STAR]. This seemed important to me, and it\u2019s quite big too. So, we shouldn\u2019t ignore it. I felt like it was related to the fourth month (April) - suggesting that this period of time is a time of significant upcoming celebrations [CUP] and recognition [STAR] for them. A new album in April maybe?? \u00a0Also, those bubbles I just mentioned were positioned near the end of the third month (March) and the beginning of the fourth (April) \u00a0- if you approach the cup\u2019s rim as a clock/calendar. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening for them around then, obviously. But it\u2019s very good, whatever it is - they\u2019ll be feeling joyful, they\u2019ll be heavily praised, and there will be a lot of money involved. Take it how you want to. It might not be something we even see but it very well could be!</p><p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b></p><p>This reading was so easy. Seriously, I could probably read for them in my sleep. The symbols and signs just leap out. I decided to do this just after their Grammy appearance because their energy was so good and I was feeling it overall. </p><p>Bangtan seem to be feeling very good at the moment (hello, kings?) and, for me, there is a sense that they\u2019re on the cusp of clearing out all of their old thoughts about themselves as individuals and as a group. There\u2019s also love, respect, pride, and the desire to be a good influence - both for themselves and for others. </p><p>There were a few warning signs - about bad influences and negativity - and the whole \u2018controlling my own destiny\u2019 thing is still alive and kicking. But, overall, this<i> </i>was such a positive cup. Filled with possibilities.</p><p>To answer your questions, Anon. If they work hard together then they can literally achieve <i>anything </i>including, dare I say it\u2026. that grammy. They have luck on their side and they have each other. They\u2019re old hands at overcoming and they\u2019re apparently not even close to their full potential (wow). So, I really doubt that this is the peak for them. It\u2019s all <i>good</i>. If they want it, and they keep working hard, the sky\u2019s the limit.</p><p>Thank you for asking for this and for your sweet message!\u00a0</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dailyjeons:v1CIca9C09ckRn4ZoHqaVw:Zs1jsd2gBQokm\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67e78b88b7e1a77b1b7240d1146aaa9f/tumblr_pmqy3zk5lH1wq9bfzo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\"></figure></p>",

(s) = small. (m) = medium. (b) = big. And the reading itself is split into two sections - the symbols painted within the cup (which are more general), and the signs I see myself (which are more personal and specific).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d38c658061972a46233285d3372d8a8/tumblr_inline_pmxh7gv8xM1viv3y5_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>THE RIM SYMBOLS (near future, up to ten days in the future):</b></p><p><b>[HEART]</b> (b) This is the rim symbol with the most significance for bts. Hearts indicate love and affectionate relationships - and the strengthening of those relationships. Hearts are also representative of a person&rsquo;s home and/or home life.</p><p><b>[CUP] </b>(m) Celebrations, social invitations, and enjoyment are on the cards. This could be a cosy get together with friends or something more &lsquo;official&rsquo; - like award shows, events etc.</p><p><b>[STAR] </b>(m) Stars shine brightly, like those favoured by this symbol. It&rsquo;s representative of successful projects, recognition, and praise. All of that hard work is about to be rewarded.</p><p><b>THE INNER CIRCLE (larger themes, for the coming weeks and months):</b></p><p><b>[MARS]</b> (b) Mars is symbolic of energy, action, and assertiveness. It&rsquo;s all about the doing. It&rsquo;s about getting things done and/or finalised.</p><p><b>[JUPITER] </b>(b) Jupiter brings good luck and good fortune. The universe is on bangtan&rsquo;s side at the moment. Heart-warming encounters are likely to significantly brighten their lives on a day-to-day basis. As will long-distance friendships, which consistently broaden their horizons and benefit them emotionally. </p><p><b>[SUN] </b>(m) People who have the sun in their cups are capable of making positive impressions on the circumstances and people around them. As a symbol it brings with it joy, creativity, and success. These people are mood-makers.</p><p><b>[MOON] </b>(m) &nbsp;Innermost feelings and intimate relationships will be important at this time. This symbol asks them to pay particular attention to their dreams (literal dreams) and their feelings and intuition.</p><p><b>WHAT THE LEAVES SAY (symbols and signs I saw in the cup):</b></p><p><b>[CROWN]</b> (b) Success, honour, and the recognition of talents are all on the horizon for bangtan. This is a very good omen for them individually and as a group - in fact, it&rsquo;s a very positive and reassuring symbol in general. </p><p>Because of its relationship to the head, the crown is a sign connected to how they view the world and how they feel about their place in it. So, it&rsquo;s very possible that they feel like the &lsquo;Kings of the World&rsquo; in some sense. This<i> could</i> sound arrogant but it really shouldn&rsquo;t - kings carry a lot of weight on their shoulders, it&rsquo;s certainly a lot of responsibility, and those with a crown in their tea cup know this all too well. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that this symbol suggests a sense of authority and the urge to lead others - no one has forced them into this life, they want and desire to be the best that they can be. They want to be kings - trials, tribulations, and all.</p><p>Significantly, the sign&rsquo;s bottom positioning warns bangtan against those around them who don&rsquo;t wear the crown themselves but still try and control it (-issues of control have come up in several of my bangtan readings, so I always consider them very important pieces in their overall picture). There may be a few struggles coming up for them in this regard - after all, kings never rule without trouble and/or contention - but it&rsquo;s nothing for them to worry about in the long run - in the end, the crown is still symbolic of supremacy and ascendance. They&rsquo;re always moving forward and upwards, and this should lead them to the attainment of their &lsquo;highest ambitions&rsquo;. &nbsp;(*tiny yoongi voice* GRAMMY?)</p><p><b>[FLAG] </b>(b) Flags are about personal values - someone&rsquo;s &lsquo;colour&rsquo;, if you will - and how this ties into their identity and the development of their identity. But they&rsquo;re also about <i>actual</i> countries (usually the birth/home country), and the ways that this country intertwines with the sense of self. So, this is bangtan&rsquo;s cup emphasising the fact that they&rsquo;re very specifically <i>Korean</i> artists, as well as artists. </p><p>The sign&rsquo;s lower position offers bangtan another warning (as with the crown)- this time against negativity. Waving their flag with pride draws a lot of attention and that, of course, can nurture jealousy and spite in others. The suggestion here is to ignore the haters as much as possible and to keep waving their flag proudly. After all, every person has power over their own identity - and that stretches to how they present it to the world. They shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraged.</p><p>The flag is also, very specifically, a message for them about their reputations. It asks them to be very wary of those with &lsquo;negative reputations&rsquo; and those who may become bad influences in their lives. This omen is urging them to remember that these kinds of people will not only impact <i>them</i> negatively but &lsquo;spoil&rsquo; their public image. It asks them to be very careful. Which makes a lot of sense, I&rsquo;m sure that many people want to be a part of their lives right now, and they won&rsquo;t all be &lsquo;good&rsquo; or have good intentions.</p><p><b>[MOOSE]</b> (b) Symbolic of strength, pride, self-esteem, courage, confidence, primal feminine energy, and life itself. Bangtan are focused/interested in finding the truth and finding guidance, for themselves and for others. </p><p>People with a moose in their cup frequently deal with oppositions and opposites. They may have many contrasting thoughts, and face many contrasting situations. Kind of like the moose itself - it&rsquo;s clumsy but it&rsquo;s graceful, it&rsquo;s weird looking but it&rsquo;s still beautiful. And bangtan have experienced / are experiencing / will experience many thing that seem to contradict one another. This is simply how their lives are. It may be confusing for them sometimes, or even shocking, but in the end it&rsquo;ll all make sense. They&rsquo;ll start to understand that these oppositions and opposites are not so far apart but actually elements of the same thing. Something looking odd, or something looking beautiful&hellip; it&rsquo;s all just about perception and aesthetics. So, this moose encourages them to have pride in <i>everything; </i>in absolutely all of their achievements (whether that&rsquo;s &lsquo;I made a great meal today&rsquo;, or &lsquo;I sold a million records&rsquo;), it&rsquo;s all important. And that sense of joy that achieving things brings to them, no matter how small it is, should be shared and basked in. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with indulging in good feelings.</p><p>Moose are strong, powerful creatures - meaning that this sign is also symbolic of those who move forward powerfully. Particularly with companions. It&rsquo;s about the strength of togetherness and solidarity. It&rsquo;s about adaptability and endurance. In this sense, it&rsquo;s a wonderful omen for their relationship at present and in the future. And bangtan should definitely be focused on the future right now. In fact, this moose encourages them to dream big, to look at the present, to observe their current reality, and to not dwell on the things they experienced in the past, especially those things that they may have &lsquo;lost&rsquo;. They should stay focused on the now, take stock of it, and move on. The past is done. It&rsquo;s finished.</p><p>Following on nicely from that little message of togetherness is the moose and its message of love. In a cup, a moose encourages all kinds of love and the creation of an atmosphere that not only attracts love but allows it to flourish. And, for long standing relationships in particular, it&rsquo;s an incredible sign of commitment and promises made. The love that bangtan share for one another is here to stay, even when time passes and the limelight fades.</p><p>The final message of the moose is one of control. It wants bangtan to know that they - and <i>only</i> they - control their own lives. (see, I told you that this comes up a lot. Some of them <i>really</i> do seem to worry about this quite a bit.) This sign reminds them that they have <i>absolute authority</i> over themselves - as individuals and as a unit. On a personal level, their cup promises them that they never <i>ever</i> have to feel ashamed or pressured - by their friends or by their peers especially. If what they choose for themselves - as individuals or as a group - is different from what others expect / want / need / choose then so be it. They need to stand strong, they need to recognise that their difference is actually a strength (kind of like the opposition thing I was talking about earlier). They should take pride in that difference and always be true to themselves. It&rsquo;s clich&eacute;, but anyone who matters will support them - both individually and as a group. And, if you have the support of the people that you care about, then the rest is far less important in the grand scheme of things.</p><p><b>[HILL] </b>(m) Gentle challenges lie ahead but they&rsquo;re the kind of challenges that result in pleasure, wisdom, and a lasting sense of achievement. Higher attainment is possible and success is almost certain. Their hill, whatever it is, will simply be overcome and they will move on. </p><p>Because this sign was near the bottom of their tea cup it argues that they still have quite a journey to undertake before they fulfil their absolute, full potential (which is both scary and impressive). All they have to do is keep working hard. Those ups and downs are not as big as they once were - hills are much more manageable than mountains - and they&rsquo;re strong enough to journey as far as they want to. Which, in terms of their creativity and their careers, is a beautiful sign. If they put in the hard work, then they&rsquo;re almost guaranteed great results. </p><p><b>[BOW TIE]</b> (m) In a tea cup, any form of bow is a happy and fortunate symbol. Often they indicate special gifts, or events that are associated with anniversaries or special achievements. While ties are representative of a person&rsquo;s sense of obligation and/or responsibility. So, it&rsquo;s very likely that bangtan feel obliged to be good, helpful, considerate influences - both for each other and for the wider world.</p><p>Unfortunately, because of their insistence on being so responsible and polite, there&rsquo;s a chance that they extend their respect to people they <i>know </i>don&rsquo;t respect them back. At all. This can, obviously, be discouraging for them. But the tie in their cup suggests that they wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. Showing a blatant lack of respect is just not a part of who they are, or who they feel they want to be / need to be - for themselves and for others. </p><p>While the bow tie itself, as you can probably guess, points to important events, honours, and great prestige.</p><p><b>[FISH] </b>(m) Fish are largely about wisdom and knowledge. Now, and in the future, bangtan are in a position to teach others and / or they&rsquo;re in a position to learn something valuable from others.</p><p>Over the upcoming months they should pay particular attention to their dreams (their literal dreams) and their daydreams. Their intuitive gifts and feelings are strong at the moment and the things that they dream up could be <i>very</i> important for them.

But the overall message here is a very positive one and it <i>should</i> be treated as such. Bangtan can overcome anything and achieve anything, as long as they push themselves to their limits. Luck is with them right now and their lives are full of abundance.</p><p>Of course, fish are also symbolic of pieces people and pieces energy - meaning that Yoongi may have a lot of sway over bangtan in general, both at the moment and throughout the year. This could take any form - the general mood, at home, at work, creatively. If this is the case, then how this year turns out for them could be significantly influenced by Yoongi and his energy. And like I said, that&rsquo;s not necessarily a &lsquo;major&rsquo; thing that we&rsquo;ll see as spectators, but it&rsquo;s important to them as a group. </p><p><b>[DINOSAUR]</b> (m) The last time I saw a dinosaur it was in Taehyung&rsquo;s cup and it was a cute diplodocus. This time it&rsquo;s in bangtan&rsquo;s cup and it&rsquo;s a cute pterodactyl. The same general message applies. There needs to be an updating of old views and old opinions - of the world, of themselves, of whatever it is.

(Valentines Day Special Part 2)</b></p><p><b>genre: smut, fluff, angst?<br/>word count: 6.8k<br/>warnings: swearing, underaged drinking, sex</b></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>YOUR POV</p><p>Although most of you had a cocktail or two during the dinner, the real drinking was about to start now back at Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s apartment. Before you all got to it, though, of course you spent at least 30 minutes taking pictures at the apartment\u2019s infamous \u201cmarble tapestry wall\u201d. It wasn\u2019t every day that the ten of you stunted like that.</p><p>\u201cWait, can I have a picture with Jungkook?\u201d You asked shyly, \u201cWe\u2019re matching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Yoongi cracked a grin, holding up his camera as you posed hugging Jungkook\u2019s waist. The boy stiffened as he felt your body lean against his, cheeks flushing as his stare flickered to your plunging neckline and how close it was to his chest. He cleared his throat, trying to channel the confidence that he usually received when dancing, and slung his arms around your shoulder, the corner of his right lip curving upwards into a smirk. \u201cSmile kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough pictures,\u201d Tae complained taking off his shoes and socks and standing on the couch, \u201clet\u2019s fucking drink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is taking a shot, and I literally mean everyone. That means you too, Jinhee.\u201d Hoseok said pulling her up from where she was sitting. The girl shrugged, one shot wouldn\u2019t kill her. The ten of you gathered in a circle, shots in one hand and phones in the other. The flashes turned on and you cheered, clinking shot drinks with several of the boys before downing it one gulp. Your face scrunched up in disgust at the burning taste of tequila, waving your hand for some water to chase it down. </p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s take another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down there, y/n.\u201d Seokjin laughed patting your back, \u201care you trying to get hammered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a rough week, I\u2019m ready to drown in alcohol.\u201d You said pouring yourself another shot and taking it without a second thought. Kevin, Jimin, and Jinhee started to scold you, threatening to leave you in your own vomit if you didn\u2019t pace yourself.</p><p>Hoseok laughed, \u201cLast time you got wasted, you offered to suck my dick, y/n.\u201d You apologized defending yourself with<i> sorry, I\u2019m a flirty drunk</i> \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, I was gonna let you. Although tonight, it might not be me you\u2019re going after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that, oppa?\u201d </p><p>Before Hoseok could answer, Yoongi played a song that brought you to your feet. Pulling the body closest in your vicinity up with you, you began swaying to the beat, facing the boy whose blue button up resembled your mini dress. \u201cDance with me Kook, I know you can.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, I wanna take another shot,\u201d He said inwardly begging for the alcohol to kick in. You agreed with a smile, entering and leaving the kitchen within minutes before taking hold of Jungkook\u2019s hand, using it as a leverage to spin around. By this point all of you were dancing and slowly but surely getting quite intoxicated. You couldn\u2019t help but stay close to Jungkook, the image of him getting more attractive as the minutes passed by. The room was beginning to get hazy as the alcohol took over your judgement. </p><p>Jungkook didn\u2019t seem to be faring any better against the liquid as his hold on your waist tightened and his gaze intensified. The sparkly innocent doe eyes you were usually met with now a different, dark, and seductive look. His eyes mimicked how you would see them when he performed and you would be lying if you said that they didn\u2019t turn you on in the slightest. He leaned closer to you, making you shiver with his breath against your ear, \u201ccan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>You nod in anticipation, your heart pounding by how close he was, \u201cI want to kiss you so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He smirked leaving their makeshift dance floor to go downstairs to the basement, his eyes telling you to follow him after a few minutes - not that any of the boys or Jinhee would notice, they were caught up in their own drunk antics anyway. Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s basement was alright, but there were two other rooms that they converted into more guest bedrooms for when the boys slept over. Going inside the first one, you let out a small \u201coh\u201d as you spotted Jungkook sitting at the edge of the bed, legs spread and arms leaning back against the duvet, \u201cI was beginning to think you weren\u2019t going to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been 5 minutes,\u201d you crossed your arms, all your weight resting on one leg. The room screamed Seokjin, the walls a nice millennial shade of pink and the furniture statement pieces. The center point of the whole room was the bed with a crown shaped headboard, directly above it hung a banner that said BT\u03a3. The boy chuckled and stood, towering over you with his large frame. Slowly, he brought his hand to your chin, tilting your head upwards to meet his lips.</p><p>The kiss was soft and sweet, nothing like the fiery stares and burning touches that he left on your body earlier tonight. He pulled away much too quickly for your liking, letting out a small whine at the loss of contact. Jungkook found it amusing teasing you, the look in his eyes now playful instead of seductive.</p><p>But no, you were not settling with a cute little peck. Almost aggressively, you cupped his cheeks and brought his lips in for another kiss, the force you put against his body enough to make him fall back on the bed. Immediately, you brought your legs to both sides of his lap, straddling him as your arms snaked around his neck. Jungkook\u2019s hands instinctively gripped your waist, barely hovering over the top of your ass. Your lips moved almost desperately against each other, tongues fighting and searching over every crevice of each others\u2019 mouths. Your hands were entangled in his hair, the boy letting out a groan when you tugged on it slightly.</p><!-- more --><p>You felt that hit your core.</p><p>\u201cy/n,\u201d He breathed out, thrusting up to grind his pelvis against yours. You gasped at the sudden amount of pleasure, your body falling forward against his chest, causing the boy to bite your shoulder in response. This time it was your turn to moan, the sound going straight to his dick. \u201cHold on, I want to make sure you\u2019re okay with this. I don\u2019t want to make you do anything you don\u2019t want to or push you to go farther than you intend to go-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKook, you\u2019re incredibly sweet and it honestly means the world to me that you\u2019re asking, but I trust you. I know what kind of person you are, and I want nothing more in this moment than for you to fuck me. Don\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>It was as if a switch went off in Jungkook\u2019s head, his gaze looking more predatory than ever. His hands went from your waist to your ass, taking fistfuls of your cheeks and squeezing. Your dress was ridden up to your stomach by now, showing the full view of your black Victoria\u2019s Secret thong that you thank god decided to wear. With a smirk, he slipped two fingers under the string, bringing it out far enough so that a light smack resonated the bedroom. \u201cAs much as I love this dress on you, I think it needs to go, don\u2019t you think baby girl?\u201d</p><p>Your stomach churned at the pet name he gave you, your hands swiftly crossing across your body to remove your dress before he even had the chance. His eyes shamelessly stared at your bare chest, one hand moving up to knead your breast, his index finger and thumb playing with your nipple. You bit your lip at the stimulation, impatiently trying to rid the boy of his own button up.</p><p>Before you could rip his shirt open, he flipped you over, your back hitting the mattress with a soft thud. He stood up and went to make sure the door was locked, going back to the edge of the bed soon after. His hands went to his shirt buttons, giving you a little strip show before the fabric fell to the floor. Sitting up on your elbows, you watched as he moved on to his pants, slipping off his belt before undoing his pants and zipper, stepping out of his tight black jeans.</p><p>Jungkook rejoined you on the bed, his lips attached to yours as his hands roamed your body. His mouth ghosted over your jawline to your neck, sucking harshly intending to leave several marks. You threw your head back, taking fistfuls of the duvet as one of his hands cupped your core, moving your thong to the side and prodding two fingers at your entrance. It was embarrassing how wet you were, but at that moment, you really couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>His fingers made figure eights on your clit, making you squirm in response. Smiling against your neck, he thrusted his fingers into your pussy, biting at the already abused flesh of your neck as you let out a rather loud moan. You were thankful that the music upstairs was still blasting otherwise the whole apartment would have just heard you.</p><p>You reached for his crotch with one hand, squeezing his member through his boxers. Jungkook let out a <i>fuck</i>, hastily removing the last of both of your undergarments. Your eyes bulged at his dick, although not the biggest you\u2019ve ever seen, it was definitely on the girthy side. Impatiently, he went to the drawer and pulled out a condom, rolling it onto his length before lining it up with your entrance. You put your hand on his chest, motioning for him to stop, \u201cwait. Jungkook, I want to suck your dick-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck as much as I would love for you to do that, y/n, I need to be inside you right now. We\u2019ll do that next time,\u201d He said moving his tip up and down your slit, making sure it was well-lubricated enough to slide in. You gasped as his dick slowly entered you, feeling the burning stretch almost immediately. As soon as he was buried to the hilt, you clenched your pussy making him moan. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJungkook<i> please</i> move,\u201d you whined thrusting your hips up. The boy grabbed your arms, pinning them against the mattress as he started to thrust at a leisurely pace. \u201cJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go faster baby girl?\u201d He asked with a smirk, staring down at you authoritatively. You nodded, now that you were used to his length, you needed him to just wreck you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy please</i>.\u201d</p><p>With the magic word, he rested his forehead against yours, keeping eye contact with you as his pace rapidly quickened. Anyone who said sex intoxicated is a bad idea, has clearly never had sex with Jeon Jungkook. Every time he thrusted back in, his tip lightly grazed over your g spot, your stomach tightening in record time.</p><p>You clenched your stomach as your high approached, the sudden tightness making Jungkook drill into you even faster, chasing his own climax. You moaned into his shoulder as you came, the boy muffling curses against your neck as he released into the condom. He rested on top of you, keeping his length in you for a few moments more before he had to pull out.</p><p>You were feeling a little bit more sober now, your body still laying down. Jungkook stood and removed the condom, throwing it away in the trash bin before finding some tissues and wiping his length of any cum. Taking an additional few tissues, he returned to where you laid and started wiping your core clean, your body wincing from sensitivity. He apologized with a sweet smile, tossing the tissues before coming back to join you on the bed.</p><p>The sweet doe-eyed boy was back, even with how incredibly sinful he looked naked. Jungkook stared at you as you sat up, admiring how breathtaking you looked post-sex. You chuckled and moved closer, hugging his waist, \u201cdo you think they\u2019re looking for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d He shrugged wrapping his arms around your body. \u201cWe should probably go back.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and pressed a soft kiss on his cheek, \u201cYeah, we should, daddy.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed as you searched for your dress and thong, \u201cDon\u2019t say that unless you want a round two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I don\u2019t?\u201d </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cYooooongi.\u201d Jinhee laid down dramatically from her seated position on the couch, her head hitting Yoongi\u2019s thighs. Yoongi\u2019s slowly sobering attention went to the silver haired girl, looking down and tilting his head when she drawled out his name. \u201cWhy the hell are you playing so much rap? It\u2019s thotty hours, we should be playing some fuckin\u2019&hellip; Trap or some shit. Give me the fucking phone.\u201d Her hands reached out for the phone in Yoongi\u2019s hand, the phone only lifting slightly so that it was out of her reach. His phone was the only one connected to the house\u2019s speaker, and he was confused as to why she suddenly had a problem with the music. </p><p>Jinhee whined, sitting back up and reaching for his phone once more. Once she was basically on his lap, she finally got a hold of his phone, trying to unlock it. Yoongi sighed, holding his hand out. </p><p>\u201cJinhee, my lineage are the only people who can unlock it, give me back my phone.\u201d Yoongi managed to muster at least a little bit of authority in his voice, grabbing for his phone from the younger one. Jinhee only kept swerving, getting up and stumbling around to avoid Yoongi grabbing for his phone. He only followed after her slowly, watching her stumble around. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? Why won\u2019t it unlock?! I won\u2019t until we play fucking something else! Alexa, play<i> Reel It In</i> by Amine!\u201d Jinhee managed to yell that over the music, frowning when she didn\u2019t get a response back. Yoongi furrowed his brows. Seokjin and Hoseok didn\u2019t have an Alexa in the first place, so where did Jinhee get that idea? </p><p>\u201cJinhee, maybe you need to drink some water\u2026\u201c Yoongi started, swiping his phone from her. He tucked his phone away and reached towards Jinhee. She squinted, pushing the general direction of Yoongi\u2019s hands away. </p><p>\u201cBitch, why the fuck are you trying to touch me? Weird ass creep!\u201d A hand flew in the air, and a crisp smack resonated through the room.</p><p>If Yoongi wasn\u2019t completely sober before then, he clearly was now. He stood there in shock, trying to process what was happening, but everything after that felt like it was happening in slow motion. Jinhee attempted to jump on him to hit him more, but she was held back by Jimin, who was oddly concerned about her. </p><p>\u201cWoah woah calm down Jinhee! You know what? You need to calm down, let\u2019s go to Jin hyung\u2019s room.\u201d Jimin said softly, spinning her around and leading her to Seokjin\u2019s room. His hand settled on the small of her back, making Yoongi shift uncomfortably.</p><p>He sat back down on the couch, sighing slowly in defeat. Namjoon came over a few beats later with a bag of frozen pineapple from the freezer, gently pressing it to the reddening skin of Yoongi\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\u201cHyung, are you good?\u201d Namjoon took Yoongi\u2019s phone, changing the music but to something calmer. The party that the 10 of them were hosting had been dying down for a little now, since you, Jungkook, Jimin, and Jinhee were missing from the main scene. Yoongi only frowned, shaking his head. </p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve met a violent drunk\u2026\u201d Yoongi laughs a little, throwing his head back. </p><p>\u201cYou know what, I didn\u2019t expect that from her.\u201d Seokjin laughed, settling on Yoongi\u2019s other side. Yoongi held the frozen pineapple, letting Namjoon\u2019s hand rest. Seokjin was only slightly tipsy and Namjoon, after hitting the wall, decided he was done with alcohol for the night, so he was also sobering up with the two seniors. </p><p>\u201cI feel really bad though\u2026\u201d Yoongi frowned, leaning forward so that his elbows rested on his thighs. He set down the bag of frozen pineapple, burying his face into his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her hating me for anything, it\u2019s just hard forming words around her and her and Jimin kinda make me upset, is that weird? I\u2019ve been floored by her voice for like. Months now. I caught her singing late in the practice rooms one night while I was figuring out my rep for my last recital and I just fell in love with her voice\u2014 and to now put a face to that voice? Jinhee\u2019s an angel and I feel bad for making her mad&hellip;\u201d Yoongi sighed, massaging his temples. This wasn\u2019t the first time Seokjin had heard Yoongi talk about his best friend like this, but hearing it sober for the first time was almost unbearable. </p><p>\u201cYoongi, I love you, but you need to apologize to her. And maybe confess to her. Maybe dick her down.\u201d Seokjin patted Yoongi gently, the younger one\u2019s face going red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that second one! I don\u2019t know about that last one!\u201d He exclaimed, a smile cracking on Seokjin\u2019s face. Yoongi stood up, hyping himself up to go into the room.</p><p>In the room, however, Jinhee was still as heated as she was before, pacing back and forth in Seokjin\u2019s room. Jimin watched her pace and babble from Seokjin\u2019s gaming chair, casually biting his lower lip while he eyed the singer. </p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck was he being so mean to me? He fucking started it. He wouldn\u2019t let me fucking change the song?? It literally takes like 2 seconds to unlock his fucking phone. I fucking hate him? And don\u2019t get me fucking started on how much I want to kiss him! Have you seen his hands? I don\u2019t even know if I want them on my neck choking me hard enough that I have to learn how to do actual makeup to match my neck or if I just want to hold them!\u201d She exhaled loudly, stopping in front of Seokjin\u2019s bedside table. She eyed the picture of Seokjin and Yoongi from their reveal for Beta Tau their freshman year, picking the frame up. </p><p>She made the motion to throw it down, but right when she was about to drop it, a hand wrapped around her wrist, spinning her around so that she was face to face with Jimin. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so reckless sometimes, you know that, Jinhee darling?\u201d His hands pried the framed picture away from her hands, setting the frame back down on the bedside table, only face down so that it wouldn\u2019t crack. \u201cI promised the hyungs I\u2019d calm you down, so why don\u2019t you sit down? I know the perfect way to calm you down.\u201d His eyes glinted with a little bit of mischief, pushing her gently onto the bed. Once she was sitting, he pushed her slightly, letting her move so that she was backing up and sitting with her back leaning on the sea of pillows propped up on the bed frame. He crawled over Jinhee, making her blush and look away. </p><p>Jimin only chuckled, using one of his fingers to trace her jawline before tilting her head gently so that they were making eye contact again while the other kept him steady holding the bed frame. \u201cTrust me, I know exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d He leaned in close, hearing Jinhee suck in a breath. Another chuckle. </p><p>Jimin began to pepper small kisses along Jinhee\u2019s jawline and down her neck, stopping occasionally on her neck to bite down, but not enough to make a mark. A small moan escaped her lips, her body becoming like putty in his arms as she tilted her head back so that he could have more room. He pulled away, cupping her cheeks. </p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Jimin carefully asked. His lips ghosted over hers, causing Jinhee to nod eagerly, her eyes matching his with full blown lust. Jinhee closed the gap between them almost desperately, sighing in bliss when he began kissing back, her arms wrapping around his waist. </p><p>Jimin\u2019s hands moved sensually against her body, his fingertips already playing with the edge of her dress. Lifting it up, his hands lightly moved up and down the outside of her thighs before moving inside to spread her legs apart. \u201cJimin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help you relax, baby.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her once more, expertly moving his lips as his hand stayed on Jinhee\u2019s inner thigh. She sighed in content as the older boy finally pressed his fingers against the cloth of her underwear, \u201cI can feel how wet you are, baby.\u201d</p><p>She blushed at his comment, turning her head away to the side. He only grinned, moving downwards so that he was face to face with her core. Jimin looped his fingers around the sides of her panties, licking his lips in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jinhee?\u201d The door opened suddenly, Yoongi standing at the doorway with Seokjin. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Seokjin said shocked at the sight of his brother about to eat out his best friend. Jinhee sat up abruptly quick, her face burning. </p><p>\u201cI need to. Bathroom. Attempt to die by eating Seokjin\u2019s lemon soaps.\u201d She muttered quickly, speeding through into the private bathroom. Once the door closed, Yoongi stomped up to Jimin, grabbing him by the collar. </p><p>\u201cYou. Absolute. Fuck.\u201d Yoongi growled, Seokjin stood next to Yoongi, hoping he wouldn\u2019t beat his brother up. \u201cWhat the fuck were you trying to do with her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was trying to make her relax, hyung. Isn\u2019t that what I promised?\u201d Jimin said quite casually. Yoongi paused for a minute, letting go of his collar. Jinhee peeked her head out of the bathroom, slowly trying to sneak out incognito. She managed to slip past the three, praying constantly that the floors wouldn\u2019t creak. She successfully snuck out, relaxing and going over to the couch where Namjoon sat, scrolling through his phone. Kevin, Taehyung, and Hoseok were engrossed in a game of Cards Against Humanity on the floor, so Jinhee sat next to Namjoon. She sighed, taking the plush that rested on the couch and mashing its face in. \u201cHookup culture is fucking weird, Joon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me. Have you seen y/n and Jungkook? I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re partaking in said culture.\u201d Namjoon counted heads, clicking his tongue.</p><p>Back in Seokjin\u2019s room, Jimin, Seokjin, and Yoongi were still in the same predicament, Yoongi\u2019s arms crossed as he towered over Jimin.</p><p>\u201cPark Jimin. You know she was intoxicated. So why did you still try taking advantage of her?\u201d Yoongi sighed, mussing up his own hair. The younger one shrugged, smirking a little at Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cShe was extremely willing to let me use my ways to calm her down. Why are you so mad, hm? Not like you like her or anything, right?\u201d Jimin asked rhetorically, before seeing the change in Yoongi\u2019s face. \u201cOh? Did I strike a chord?\u201d Jimin asked innocently, smiling lazily at Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cJimin, you\u2019re drunk. Apologize to him,\u201d Seokjin said firmly, holding back Yoongi from doing anything irrational. Jimin shrugged again, leaning back on his propped arms. </p><p>\u201cYou know what? It\u2019s whatever, I\u2019m just gonna take her home and apologize in the morning.\u201d Yoongi left the room, not wanting to deal with his brother anymore. </p><p>Yoongi walked back into the living room, where Jungkook and you were finally back up in, looking a little presentable in comparison to what you two were just doing. You two had joined the three playing the card game on the floor, Namjoon and Jinhee watching a video on Namjoon\u2019s phone. The party had died down considerably, making Yoongi sigh. It was still a weekday so he justified his next move, walking up to Jinhee who only eyed him and crossed her arms. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to take you back to your dorm, Seokjin said you had a shift tomorrow.\u201d Yoongi started off carefully. Jinhee didn\u2019t seem to object, instead, she sat up from resting on Namjoon\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cAlready? Jinnie\u2019s no fun.\u201d She sighed, easily complying with Yoongi. Taehyung and Kevin also looked up, seeing the two getting ready to leave. </p><p>\u201cOh, are you two leaving already? Can we tag along?\u201d Taehyung piped up. Yoongi nodded, motioning them to get ready as well. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just gonna drop Jinhee off and\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cAh, shit. I forgot my keys at my dorm and my roommate\u2019s out on a fucking date.\u201d Jinhee groaned, throwing her head back. \u201cI\u2019ll just sleep in like the lounge or something\u2026\u201d She huffed, but Yoongi\u2019s fist tightened. </p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in my dorm, it\u2019s a single.\u201d Yoongi waved goodbye to everyone, Jinhee\u2019s arm around his shoulder and Kevin and Taehyung trailing behind, suspiciously holding hands with each other. </p><p>\u2014<br/></p><p>Once Yoongi checked Jinhee in and bid goodnight to Kevin and Taehyung, the two younger brothers went back to Taehyung\u2019s room, considering that Kevin\u2019s roommates were back and he didn\u2019t want to deal with them just yet. Considering they weren\u2019t as drunk as before, Taehyung felt completely confident in confiding in someone else that wasn\u2019t just his soulmate.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kevin?\u201d Taehyung asked absentmindedly, locking the door behind him. Yeontan saw the two come in and came running over to greet the new guest, Kevin smiling softly when he saw the little ball of fluff hop on his leg. Kevin crouched down, picking up the pomeranian, scratching his chin. \u201cI have a question\u2026\u201d Taehyung bit his lip. The two sat down on the floor in their room, Yeontan running around the two of them. Kevin tilted his head, curious as to what Taehyung had to say.</p><p>\u201cOh? Shoot.\u201d Kevin\u2019s smile sent a little flutter to Taehyung\u2019s stomach. The older\u2019s hands were clasped, trying to calm down. </p><p>\u201cEarlier on the dance floor\u2026 You whispered in my ear and you told me that you really liked me, is that true?\u201d Taehyung stared at his hands. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been thinking about it and maybe I don\u2019t just like girls? I often imagine myself maybe getting with people like you and not just for sex like. I just wanna give you the world sometimes and the fact that you wore real Gucci, and not even that knockoff sh\u2014\u201c Taehyung\u2019s words were cut off by a kiss, his eyes widening. Kevin didn\u2019t feel the kiss being reciprocated, so he began to pull back. Almost frantically, Taehyung pulled him back in for another kiss, sighing in relief. </p><p>They continued to make out for a little, not going any further due to the awkward position of their knees bumping each other from the both of them sitting cross legged and the sheer fatigue both of them were feeling. They both managed to get up and make it onto Taehyung\u2019s bed, soft whispers of \u201ci really like you\u201d and replies of \u201cme too, love\u201d. </p><p>\u2014<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s time for me to take the kids back.\u201d Namjoon stood next to Seokjin, the two of them watching Jimin fuss about the mess in the apartment. Jimin\u2019s punishment, given to him by Seokjin and Hoseok, was to clean up the apartment, which was a mess to say the least. You and Jungkook were sitting on the couch now, holding each other\u2019s hands and half asleep. Seokjin nodded, patting Namjoon on the back. </p><p>\u201cHave a safe trip back up to north campus, alright?\u201d Namjoon only nodded, walking over to you and Jungkook and smiling.</p><p>\u201cHey you two, time to go back up to your dorm.\u201d Namjoon stifled a yawn. You and Jungkook nodded, the both of you getting off the couch. Jimin noticed your figures moving, a pout on his face.</p><p>\u201cAh~ My baby y/n is leaving? Have a safe trip back!\u201d Jimin said cheerfully, although him throwing the cups into the trash bag conveyed that he was just very sad to see you go. You giggled, giving him a tight hug before joining Jungkook and Namjoon at the door. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you when I get back to my dorm to let you know I didn\u2019t die the two blocks back to north campus!\u201d You yelled, grabbing Jungkook\u2019s hand as he balanced you while you slipped your shoes on. The three of you waved to those left in the apartment, starting the walk home. The whole time, you and Jungkook walked ahead of Namjoon, the older one bidding you two a goodnight as soon as you two got back to your dorm. Jungkook scanned his ID at the front of the gate to your dorm, the two of you managing to get back up to the elevators. You didn\u2019t realize that you two lived on the same floor till then, and you only realized it when you both got off at the same floor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to wake up for our 8 am~\u201d Jungkook teased you, adding a cute ending syllable to your name. You blushed a little, giggling before you snuck one last kiss before running into your room. Once the door shut, your grin never fell off your face till you fell asleep, and Jungkook would also have to say the same.</p><p>\u2014<br/></p><p>Your alarm sounded at 6:30 am, you groaned squinting at the tiny screen of your phone. Fuck, you had class. You got ready for class half-awake, putting the least amount of effort possible to look presentable to go out. Your mind didn\u2019t register the events from last night until you saw Jungkook walk into class, wearing grey sweats and a white shirt (no surprise there) and making a simple outfit look so fucking good. You, on the other hand, suddenly felt self conscious about your pink hoodie, black leggings, and messy bun. Nonetheless, you waved brightly as you made eye contact with him. Jungkook waved awkwardly, sitting in the front row instead of his usual spot in the back next to you. Your cheeks burned in embarrassment, staring into the back of his head as you wondered why he was acting so weird. He didn\u2019t even respond to the meme you texted him during class, and he always responded to memes.</p><p>Warily, you approached him as class ended, Jungkook had a habit of packing up slowly. \u201cHey, did I do something wrong? You\u2019re acting really weird.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at you, his eyes widening like a deer in headlights, \u201cN-no, you did nothing wrong! Sorry, I just uh&hellip;I gotta go, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You frowned as he left the classroom, panic suddenly filling your insides at the events from last night. You cradled your head in your hands, your breath getting shorter as you stressed out. Immediately, you rushed back to your dorm, not having the willpower to go to your next class. After dropping your backpack in your dorm room, you pulled your phone and some headphones out, dialing your Big on FaceTime.</p><p>\u201cMy Little,\u201d she smiled upon answering, \u201cI was meaning to call you last night and tell you that you looked so hot, but I fell asleep and forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnie.\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in your eyes, your voice breaking as you called out her name. Her face broke out in worry, questioning you endlessly as you began to cry. As soon as you regained your breath, you spilled everything about last night and this morning to her, \u201c-I just don\u2019t know if he like regrets having sex with me? Or if he just became friends with me so that we could fuck and now that we have he doesn\u2019t wanna be friends anymore?? Like Jieun unnie, I don\u2019t know what&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, now that sounds ridiculous. Jungkook wouldn\u2019t do that to you, especially since you\u2019re Jimin\u2019s potential little sis. It would ruin their brotherhood if he played you like that,\u201d Jieun said reasonably, \u201cHe\u2019s probably just dealing with his own shit, y/n. I don\u2019t think you should take it personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if-\u201d</p><p>The lounge door slowly opened, the same brown-haired doe-eyed boy that you were ranting about behind the door. He called your name softly, asking if you wanted to talk back in his room. You told your Big you would call her later, furiously wiping away at your tears as you followed him the couple rooms down to his single. You sat down on his bean bag chair as he went to his bed, the atmosphere awkward as he stared at you sniffling across from him.</p><p>\u201cy/n-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I bad yesterday? Like was I just a really bad fuck?\u201d You blurted, eyes puffy from crying.</p><p>He shook his head, both hands mirroring the movement as he continuously denied your statement, \u201cNo y/n, you were, wow, amazing. It was honestly the best I\u2019ve had. I just&hellip;like&hellip;isn\u2019t drunk sex nonconsensual??\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like I took advantage of you or something, especially since you\u2019re basically Jimin hyung\u2019s little. And I made you cry too, like-\u201d He stopped as you started giggling, confused at your change of emotion.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I wanted everything that we did yesterday. I don\u2019t regret any single part of it.\u201d You said, \u201cit\u2019s cute that you would worry about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, we did agree on a round two, didn\u2019t we?\u201d You said with a little smirk, wiping away any leftover tears from your face.</p><p>He chuckled, scratching the back of his neck, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you cry. Trust me, that was the last thing I ever wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>You crossed your arms, \u201cThat\u2019s because I thought you hated me or maybe you thought I was ugly, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, y/n, and you are nowhere near ugly.\u201d He said grabbing your hands to pull you up for a hug. You wrapped your arms around his waist, your body suddenly hyperaware of his abdomen pressing against you. He relaxed, resting his chin on top of your head. \u201cSo, daddy kink, huh?\u201d</p><p>You shoved him away while laughing, but he caught the blush on your cheeks. You told him to shut up, threatening to tell the boys about what happened.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d be in more trouble than me, y/n.\u201d He chuckled, \u201cbesides, I think they already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do? Jimin oppa<i> knows</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were all pretty drunk last night, y/n. Apparently even Jinhee noona slapped Yoongi hyung.\u201d He said, your mouth making an O shape at the new piece of information. The both of you casually sat down on his bed, suddenly not knowing what to say. </p><p>\u201cSo, uh, what do you wanna do about last night?\u201d He asked, fingers playing with the ends of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you said carefully, \u201cwhat can we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can either pretend it never happened, say it was a one time thing, or I don\u2019t know, maybe we can make a deal.\u201d He said, his voice trailing at the end.</p><p>You raised your eyebrow, \u201cWhat kind of deal? Like, be fuck buddies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah.\u201d He said, a flash of confidence in his tone, \u201cCollege and Greek life is stressful, and having someone to relieve stress with - that isn\u2019t a stranger - could be beneficial. For the both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck around with many guys, Jeon. Even though drunk me may act differently.\u201d You said seriously, \u201cyou\u2019re a sweet friend, but I know your previous sex stories and I\u2019m not the kind of girl who waits to be someone\u2019s safe backup when they get rejected by someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear y/n, if you agree to this, you\u2019ll be the only girl I\u2019ll be with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But if I see you hook up with someone else at a party, I\u2019ll beat you up before Jimin oppa can.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, completely hooked by your feistiness. \u201cDeal, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u2014<br/></p><p>The first thing Jinhee felt when she woke up was the head splitting headache. She groaned, the feeling of death washing over her senses.</p><p>Right\u2026 That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t drink. The pounding in her ears seemed to almost be unbearable, but the warmth on top of her head helped aid the headache.</p><p>Wait\u2014 Why was there something warm on her head?</p><p>Jinhee mentally prepared herself for the light, opening her eyes to see a pair of green cat eyes looking back at her curiously. Immediately, instead of freaking out, she only tensed for a split moment before reaching up to the cat on her chest, her hand in a loosely covered fist. The grey cat saw the movement, only registering it for a few seconds before it began to nuzzle into her hand. Jinhee softened, scratching the cheek of the cat. It was only then that Jinhee saw the sleeves of the dark green sweater she was wearing. Last she remembered, she never owned a dark green champion crewneck. Immediately, she sat up, squinting as she didn\u2019t have her contacts in. She looked around the room, hazy memories of her making out with someone making her heartbeat speed up. The cat, which had hopped off her chest as soon as she sat up only looked back at her in curiosity before her eyes landed on the sleeping figure on the couch across from the single desk in the room. </p><p>There was Min Yoongi, sleeping casually on the couch. She connected two and two, recognizing the cat to be his own, Killmonger. The said cat hopped onto the couch, kneading at the throw blanket on top of the sleeping pianist. Jinhee\u2019s face went red, watching as he woke up. Yoongi woke up slowly, sitting up and looking over at the blushing singer.</p><p>\u201cMm, good morning, Jinhee.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s morning voice sent shivers down Jinhee\u2019s spine, the younger one\u2019s mind already going a million miles a minute. </p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 Did we do something last night? Why am I here? Why didn\u2019t you just leave me at Seokjin\u2019s place?\u201d Jinhee was asking too many questions for her head to be in that much pain and for Yoongi just waking up. Yoongi gave a little chuckle, his hand casually scratching his cat\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened, but you did almost strip in front of me after complaining dresses were too confining, hence my sweater and a pair of shorts a girl left behind some months ago &ndash; don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s washed.\u201d Jinhee felt a twinge of jealousy, only casually gripping at the cuffs of the sweater before releasing her fists. </p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t explain how I got here! I remember making out with someone, was that someone you? Oh my god, did Killmonger watch us?\u201d Jinhee interrogated. This time, it was Yoongi\u2019s turn to tense up. He stopped scratching Killmonger for a little too long, the cat sliding out of his hand. After the flash of anger subsided, Yoongi only chuckled. </p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me. To explain, you slapped the shit out of me because I didn\u2019t let you change the music and Seokjin just told me to bring you home\u2026 Which, by the way, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t let you change the music, although, I don\u2019t think sober you wouldn\u2019t put up as much of a fuss as drunk you did.\u201d His explanation only made Jinhee more embarrassed hearing about her drunk. She looked down, playing with the hem of the sweater.</p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s okay, I guess.\u201d Jinhee\u2019s words barely came out above a whisper, but it was loud enough that Yoongi could hear her. She swung her feet over to grab her (charging, she might add) phone. Her eyes widened at the time, \u201coh fuck, my shift starts in an hour\u2026\u201d She scrambled over to the door, wincing when she put the high heels back on and grabbed her dress from the desk chair. \u201cThank god I live across the street, right?\u201d She laughed a little uncomfortably, Yoongi trailing behind her so he could check her out of the building. He grabbed onto a little gift before they both left his dorm, the both of them going into the elevator and heading down.</p><p>He gave the RA on duty a little nod as she grabbed her ID, his fist clenching a little around the gift for her.</p><p>\u201cJinhee.\u201d Yoongi finally mustered the courage to say her name, the younger one spinning around in curiosity and almost losing her balance. Jinhee tilted her head, watching Yoongi retrieve a little gift bag from his pocket. Inside the clear cellophane bag was some matcha shortbread cookies, haphazardly covered in white chocolate and the bag was tied off with a ribbon wrapping and her name written messily on a card. \u201cI forgot to give this to you yesterday, uh. Happy Valentines day?\u201d </p><p>Jinhee\u2019s heart softened at the bag of cookies, taking it with a smile. \u201cY-Yeah, happy Valentines, Yoongi.\u201d Their hands lingered on each other for just the slightest bit before she raised her other hand to wave goodbye, running across the street to her dorm. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t till she got home and looked at herself in the mirror when she realized she was barefaced, meaning he had wiped off her makeup while she was sleeping. Her mouth curved into a small smile once more, putting on her regular makeup and her glasses before changing into pants. She opted to wear the same sweatshirt (it fits my hair color, she convinced herself), grabbing her backpack with Yoongi\u2019s cookies in it and keys before slipping on her shoes and leaving her dorm. </p><p>\u2014<br/></p><p><i>2-14-19</i></p><p><i>happy valentines day everyone :)</i></p>",

Before you all got to it, though, of course you spent at least 30 minutes taking pictures at the apartment&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;marble tapestry wall&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t every day that the ten of you stunted like that.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Wait, can I have a picture with Jungkook?&rdquo; You asked shyly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re matching.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Yoongi cracked a grin, holding up his camera as you posed hugging Jungkook&rsquo;s waist. The boy stiffened as he felt your body lean against his, cheeks flushing as his stare flickered to your plunging neckline and how close it was to his chest. He cleared his throat, trying to channel the confidence that he usually received when dancing, and slung his arms around your shoulder, the corner of his right lip curving upwards into a smirk. &ldquo;Smile kids.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Enough pictures,&rdquo; Tae complained taking off his shoes and socks and standing on the couch, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s fucking drink!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone is taking a shot, and I literally mean everyone. That means you too, Jinhee.&rdquo; Hoseok said pulling her up from where she was sitting. The girl shrugged, one shot wouldn&rsquo;t kill her. The ten of you gathered in a circle, shots in one hand and phones in the other. The flashes turned on and you cheered, clinking shot drinks with several of the boys before downing it one gulp. Your face scrunched up in disgust at the burning taste of tequila, waving your hand for some water to chase it down. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s take another.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Slow down there, y/n.&rdquo; Seokjin laughed patting your back, &ldquo;are you trying to get hammered?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a rough week, I&rsquo;m ready to drown in alcohol.&rdquo; You said pouring yourself another shot and taking it without a second thought. Kevin, Jimin, and Jinhee started to scold you, threatening to leave you in your own vomit if you didn&rsquo;t pace yourself.</p>\n<p>Hoseok laughed, &ldquo;Last time you got wasted, you offered to suck my dick, y/n.&rdquo; You apologized defending yourself with<i> sorry, I&rsquo;m a flirty drunk</i> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize, I was gonna let you. Although tonight, it might not be me you&rsquo;re going after.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, oppa?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Before Hoseok could answer, Yoongi played a song that brought you to your feet. Pulling the body closest in your vicinity up with you, you began swaying to the beat, facing the boy whose blue button up resembled your mini dress. &ldquo;Dance with me Kook, I know you can.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Wait, I wanna take another shot,&rdquo; He said inwardly begging for the alcohol to kick in. You agreed with a smile, entering and leaving the kitchen within minutes before taking hold of Jungkook&rsquo;s hand, using it as a leverage to spin around. By this point all of you were dancing and slowly but surely getting quite intoxicated. You couldn&rsquo;t help but stay close to Jungkook, the image of him getting more attractive as the minutes passed by. The room was beginning to get hazy as the alcohol took over your judgement. </p>\n<p>Jungkook didn&rsquo;t seem to be faring any better against the liquid as his hold on your waist tightened and his gaze intensified. The sparkly innocent doe eyes you were usually met with now a different, dark, and seductive look. His eyes mimicked how you would see them when he performed and you would be lying if you said that they didn&rsquo;t turn you on in the slightest. He leaned closer to you, making you shiver with his breath against your ear, &ldquo;can I tell you something?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You nod in anticipation, your heart pounding by how close he was, &ldquo;I want to kiss you so bad.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He smirked leaving their makeshift dance floor to go downstairs to the basement, his eyes telling you to follow him after a few minutes - not that any of the boys or Jinhee would notice, they were caught up in their own drunk antics anyway. Seokjin and Hoseok&rsquo;s basement was alright, but there were two other rooms that they converted into more guest bedrooms for when the boys slept over. Going inside the first one, you let out a small &ldquo;oh&rdquo; as you spotted Jungkook sitting at the edge of the bed, legs spread and arms leaning back against the duvet, &ldquo;I was beginning to think you weren&rsquo;t going to come.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been 5 minutes,&rdquo; you crossed your arms, all your weight resting on one leg. The room screamed Seokjin, the walls a nice millennial shade of pink and the furniture statement pieces. The center point of the whole room was the bed with a crown shaped headboard, directly above it hung a banner that said BT&Sigma;. The boy chuckled and stood, towering over you with his large frame. Slowly, he brought his hand to your chin, tilting your head upwards to meet his lips.</p>\n<p>The kiss was soft and sweet, nothing like the fiery stares and burning touches that he left on your body earlier tonight.

Almost aggressively, you cupped his cheeks and brought his lips in for another kiss, the force you put against his body enough to make him fall back on the bed. Immediately, you brought your legs to both sides of his lap, straddling him as your arms snaked around his neck. Jungkook&rsquo;s hands instinctively gripped your waist, barely hovering over the top of your ass. Your lips moved almost desperately against each other, tongues fighting and searching over every crevice of each others&rsquo; mouths. Your hands were entangled in his hair, the boy letting out a groan when you tugged on it slightly.</p>\n",

Your lips moved almost desperately against each other, tongues fighting and searching over every crevice of each others\u2019 mouths. Your hands were entangled in his hair, the boy letting out a groan when you tugged on it slightly.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You felt that hit your core.</p><p>\u201cy/n,\u201d He breathed out, thrusting up to grind his pelvis against yours. You gasped at the sudden amount of pleasure, your body falling forward against his chest, causing the boy to bite your shoulder in response. This time it was your turn to moan, the sound going straight to his dick. \u201cHold on, I want to make sure you\u2019re okay with this. I don\u2019t want to make you do anything you don\u2019t want to or push you to go farther than you intend to go-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKook, you\u2019re incredibly sweet and it honestly means the world to me that you\u2019re asking, but I trust you. I know what kind of person you are, and I want nothing more in this moment than for you to fuck me. Don\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>It was as if a switch went off in Jungkook\u2019s head, his gaze looking more predatory than ever. His hands went from your waist to your ass, taking fistfuls of your cheeks and squeezing. Your dress was ridden up to your stomach by now, showing the full view of your black Victoria\u2019s Secret thong that you thank god decided to wear. With a smirk, he slipped two fingers under the string, bringing it out far enough so that a light smack resonated the bedroom. \u201cAs much as I love this dress on you, I think it needs to go, don\u2019t you think baby girl?\u201d</p><p>Your stomach churned at the pet name he gave you, your hands swiftly crossing across your body to remove your dress before he even had the chance. His eyes shamelessly stared at your bare chest, one hand moving up to knead your breast, his index finger and thumb playing with your nipple. You bit your lip at the stimulation, impatiently trying to rid the boy of his own button up.</p><p>Before you could rip his shirt open, he flipped you over, your back hitting the mattress with a soft thud. He stood up and went to make sure the door was locked, going back to the edge of the bed soon after. His hands went to his shirt buttons, giving you a little strip show before the fabric fell to the floor. Sitting up on your elbows, you watched as he moved on to his pants, slipping off his belt before undoing his pants and zipper, stepping out of his tight black jeans.</p><p>Jungkook rejoined you on the bed, his lips attached to yours as his hands roamed your body. His mouth ghosted over your jawline to your neck, sucking harshly intending to leave several marks. You threw your head back, taking fistfuls of the duvet as one of his hands cupped your core, moving your thong to the side and prodding two fingers at your entrance. It was embarrassing how wet you were, but at that moment, you really couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>His fingers made figure eights on your clit, making you squirm in response. Smiling against your neck, he thrusted his fingers into your pussy, biting at the already abused flesh of your neck as you let out a rather loud moan. You were thankful that the music upstairs was still blasting otherwise the whole apartment would have just heard you.</p><p>You reached for his crotch with one hand, squeezing his member through his boxers. Jungkook let out a <i>fuck</i>, hastily removing the last of both of your undergarments. Your eyes bulged at his dick, although not the biggest you\u2019ve ever seen, it was definitely on the girthy side. Impatiently, he went to the drawer and pulled out a condom, rolling it onto his length before lining it up with your entrance. You put your hand on his chest, motioning for him to stop, \u201cwait. Jungkook, I want to suck your dick-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck as much as I would love for you to do that, y/n, I need to be inside you right now. We\u2019ll do that next time,\u201d He said moving his tip up and down your slit, making sure it was well-lubricated enough to slide in. You gasped as his dick slowly entered you, feeling the burning stretch almost immediately. As soon as he was buried to the hilt, you clenched your pussy making him moan. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJungkook<i> please</i> move,\u201d you whined thrusting your hips up. The boy grabbed your arms, pinning them against the mattress as he started to thrust at a leisurely pace. \u201cJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go faster baby girl?\u201d He asked with a smirk, staring down at you authoritatively. You nodded, now that you were used to his length, you needed him to just wreck you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy please</i>.\u201d</p><p>With the magic word, he rested his forehead against yours, keeping eye contact with you as his pace rapidly quickened. Anyone who said sex intoxicated is a bad idea, has clearly never had sex with Jeon Jungkook. Every time he thrusted back in, his tip lightly grazed over your g spot, your stomach tightening in record time.</p><p>You clenched your stomach as your high approached, the sudden tightness making Jungkook drill into you even faster, chasing his own climax. You moaned into his shoulder as you came, the boy muffling curses against your neck as he released into the condom. He rested on top of you, keeping his length in you for a few moments more before he had to pull out.</p><p>You were feeling a little bit more sober now, your body still laying down. Jungkook stood and removed the condom, throwing it away in the trash bin before finding some tissues and wiping his length of any cum. Taking an additional few tissues, he returned to where you laid and started wiping your core clean, your body wincing from sensitivity. He apologized with a sweet smile, tossing the tissues before coming back to join you on the bed.</p><p>The sweet doe-eyed boy was back, even with how incredibly sinful he looked naked. Jungkook stared at you as you sat up, admiring how breathtaking you looked post-sex. You chuckled and moved closer, hugging his waist, \u201cdo you think they\u2019re looking for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d He shrugged wrapping his arms around your body. \u201cWe should probably go back.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and pressed a soft kiss on his cheek, \u201cYeah, we should, daddy.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed as you searched for your dress and thong, \u201cDon\u2019t say that unless you want a round two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I don\u2019t?\u201d </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cYooooongi.\u201d Jinhee laid down dramatically from her seated position on the couch, her head hitting Yoongi\u2019s thighs. Yoongi\u2019s slowly sobering attention went to the silver haired girl, looking down and tilting his head when she drawled out his name. \u201cWhy the hell are you playing so much rap? It\u2019s thotty hours, we should be playing some fuckin\u2019\u2026 Trap or some shit. Give me the fucking phone.\u201d Her hands reached out for the phone in Yoongi\u2019s hand, the phone only lifting slightly so that it was out of her reach. His phone was the only one connected to the house\u2019s speaker, and he was confused as to why she suddenly had a problem with the music. </p><p>Jinhee whined, sitting back up and reaching for his phone once more. Once she was basically on his lap, she finally got a hold of his phone, trying to unlock it. Yoongi sighed, holding his hand out. </p><p>\u201cJinhee, my lineage are the only people who can unlock it, give me back my phone.\u201d Yoongi managed to muster at least a little bit of authority in his voice, grabbing for his phone from the younger one. Jinhee only kept swerving, getting up and stumbling around to avoid Yoongi grabbing for his phone. He only followed after her slowly, watching her stumble around. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? Why won\u2019t it unlock?! I won\u2019t until we play fucking something else! Alexa, play<i> Reel It In</i> by Amine!\u201d Jinhee managed to yell that over the music, frowning when she didn\u2019t get a response back. Yoongi furrowed his brows. Seokjin and Hoseok didn\u2019t have an Alexa in the first place, so where did Jinhee get that idea? </p><p>\u201cJinhee, maybe you need to drink some water\u2026\u201c Yoongi started, swiping his phone from her. He tucked his phone away and reached towards Jinhee. She squinted, pushing the general direction of Yoongi\u2019s hands away. </p><p>\u201cBitch, why the fuck are you trying to touch me? Weird ass creep!\u201d A hand flew in the air, and a crisp smack resonated through the room.</p><p>If Yoongi wasn\u2019t completely sober before then, he clearly was now. He stood there in shock, trying to process what was happening, but everything after that felt like it was happening in slow motion. Jinhee attempted to jump on him to hit him more, but she was held back by Jimin, who was oddly concerned about her. </p><p>\u201cWoah woah calm down Jinhee! You know what? You need to calm down, let\u2019s go to Jin hyung\u2019s room.\u201d Jimin said softly, spinning her around and leading her to Seokjin\u2019s room. His hand settled on the small of her back, making Yoongi shift uncomfortably.</p><p>He sat back down on the couch, sighing slowly in defeat. Namjoon came over a few beats later with a bag of frozen pineapple from the freezer, gently pressing it to the reddening skin of Yoongi\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\u201cHyung, are you good?\u201d Namjoon took Yoongi\u2019s phone, changing the music but to something calmer. The party that the 10 of them were hosting had been dying down for a little now, since you, Jungkook, Jimin, and Jinhee were missing from the main scene. Yoongi only frowned, shaking his head. </p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve met a violent drunk\u2026\u201d Yoongi laughs a little, throwing his head back. </p><p>\u201cYou know what, I didn\u2019t expect that from her.\u201d Seokjin laughed, settling on Yoongi\u2019s other side. Yoongi held the frozen pineapple, letting Namjoon\u2019s hand rest. Seokjin was only slightly tipsy and Namjoon, after hitting the wall, decided he was done with alcohol for the night, so he was also sobering up with the two seniors. </p><p>\u201cI feel really bad though\u2026\u201d Yoongi frowned, leaning forward so that his elbows rested on his thighs. He set down the bag of frozen pineapple, burying his face into his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her hating me for anything, it\u2019s just hard forming words around her and her and Jimin kinda make me upset, is that weird? I\u2019ve been floored by her voice for like. Months now. I caught her singing late in the practice rooms one night while I was figuring out my rep for my last recital and I just fell in love with her voice\u2014 and to now put a face to that voice? Jinhee\u2019s an angel and I feel bad for making her mad\u2026\u201d Yoongi sighed, massaging his temples. This wasn\u2019t the first time Seokjin had heard Yoongi talk about his best friend like this, but hearing it sober for the first time was almost unbearable. </p><p>\u201cYoongi, I love you, but you need to apologize to her. And maybe confess to her. Maybe dick her down.\u201d Seokjin patted Yoongi gently, the younger one\u2019s face going red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that second one! I don\u2019t know about that last one!\u201d He exclaimed, a smile cracking on Seokjin\u2019s face. Yoongi stood up, hyping himself up to go into the room.</p><p>In the room, however, Jinhee was still as heated as she was before, pacing back and forth in Seokjin\u2019s room. Jimin watched her pace and babble from Seokjin\u2019s gaming chair, casually biting his lower lip while he eyed the singer. </p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck was he being so mean to me? He fucking started it. He wouldn\u2019t let me fucking change the song?? It literally takes like 2 seconds to unlock his fucking phone. I fucking hate him? And don\u2019t get me fucking started on how much I want to kiss him! Have you seen his hands? I don\u2019t even know if I want them on my neck choking me hard enough that I have to learn how to do actual makeup to match my neck or if I just want to hold them!\u201d She exhaled loudly, stopping in front of Seokjin\u2019s bedside table. She eyed the picture of Seokjin and Yoongi from their reveal for Beta Tau their freshman year, picking the frame up. </p><p>She made the motion to throw it down, but right when she was about to drop it, a hand wrapped around her wrist, spinning her around so that she was face to face with Jimin. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so reckless sometimes, you know that, Jinhee darling?\u201d His hands pried the framed picture away from her hands, setting the frame back down on the bedside table, only face down so that it wouldn\u2019t crack. \u201cI promised the hyungs I\u2019d calm you down, so why don\u2019t you sit down? I know the perfect way to calm you down.\u201d His eyes glinted with a little bit of mischief, pushing her gently onto the bed. Once she was sitting, he pushed her slightly, letting her move so that she was backing up and sitting with her back leaning on the sea of pillows propped up on the bed frame. He crawled over Jinhee, making her blush and look away. </p><p>Jimin only chuckled, using one of his fingers to trace her jawline before tilting her head gently so that they were making eye contact again while the other kept him steady holding the bed frame. \u201cTrust me, I know exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d He leaned in close, hearing Jinhee suck in a breath. Another chuckle. </p><p>Jimin began to pepper small kisses along Jinhee\u2019s jawline and down her neck, stopping occasionally on her neck to bite down, but not enough to make a mark. A small moan escaped her lips, her body becoming like putty in his arms as she tilted her head back so that he could have more room. He pulled away, cupping her cheeks. </p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Jimin carefully asked. His lips ghosted over hers, causing Jinhee to nod eagerly, her eyes matching his with full blown lust. Jinhee closed the gap between them almost desperately, sighing in bliss when he began kissing back, her arms wrapping around his waist. </p><p>Jimin\u2019s hands moved sensually against her body, his fingertips already playing with the edge of her dress. Lifting it up, his hands lightly moved up and down the outside of her thighs before moving inside to spread her legs apart. \u201cJimin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help you relax, baby.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her once more, expertly moving his lips as his hand stayed on Jinhee\u2019s inner thigh. She sighed in content as the older boy finally pressed his fingers against the cloth of her underwear, \u201cI can feel how wet you are, baby.\u201d</p><p>She blushed at his comment, turning her head away to the side. He only grinned, moving downwards so that he was face to face with her core. Jimin looped his fingers around the sides of her panties, licking his lips in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jinhee?\u201d The door opened suddenly, Yoongi standing at the doorway with Seokjin. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Seokjin said shocked at the sight of his brother about to eat out his best friend. Jinhee sat up abruptly quick, her face burning. </p><p>\u201cI need to. Bathroom. Attempt to die by eating Seokjin\u2019s lemon soaps.\u201d She muttered quickly, speeding through into the private bathroom. Once the door closed, Yoongi stomped up to Jimin, grabbing him by the collar. </p><p>\u201cYou. Absolute. Fuck.\u201d Yoongi growled, Seokjin stood next to Yoongi, hoping he wouldn\u2019t beat his brother up. \u201cWhat the fuck were you trying to do with her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was trying to make her relax, hyung. Isn\u2019t that what I promised?\u201d Jimin said quite casually. Yoongi paused for a minute, letting go of his collar. Jinhee peeked her head out of the bathroom, slowly trying to sneak out incognito. She managed to slip past the three, praying constantly that the floors wouldn\u2019t creak. She successfully snuck out, relaxing and going over to the couch where Namjoon sat, scrolling through his phone. Kevin, Taehyung, and Hoseok were engrossed in a game of Cards Against Humanity on the floor, so Jinhee sat next to Namjoon. She sighed, taking the plush that rested on the couch and mashing its face in. \u201cHookup culture is fucking weird, Joon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me. Have you seen y/n and Jungkook? I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re partaking in said culture.\u201d Namjoon counted heads, clicking his tongue.</p><p>Back in Seokjin\u2019s room, Jimin, Seokjin, and Yoongi were still in the same predicament, Yoongi\u2019s arms crossed as he towered over Jimin.</p><p>\u201cPark Jimin. You know she was intoxicated. So why did you still try taking advantage of her?\u201d Yoongi sighed, mussing up his own hair. The younger one shrugged, smirking a little at Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cShe was extremely willing to let me use my ways to calm her down. Why are you so mad, hm? Not like you like her or anything, right?\u201d Jimin asked rhetorically, before seeing the change in Yoongi\u2019s face. \u201cOh? Did I strike a chord?\u201d Jimin asked innocently, smiling lazily at Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cJimin, you\u2019re drunk. Apologize to him,\u201d Seokjin said firmly, holding back Yoongi from doing anything irrational. Jimin shrugged again, leaning back on his propped arms. </p><p>\u201cYou know what? It\u2019s whatever, I\u2019m just gonna take her home and apologize in the morning.\u201d Yoongi left the room, not wanting to deal with his brother anymore. </p><p>Yoongi walked back into the living room, where Jungkook and you were finally back up in, looking a little presentable in comparison to what you two were just doing. You two had joined the three playing the card game on the floor, Namjoon and Jinhee watching a video on Namjoon\u2019s phone. The party had died down considerably, making Yoongi sigh. It was still a weekday so he justified his next move, walking up to Jinhee who only eyed him and crossed her arms. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to take you back to your dorm, Seokjin said you had a shift tomorrow.\u201d Yoongi started off carefully. Jinhee didn\u2019t seem to object, instead, she sat up from resting on Namjoon\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cAlready? Jinnie\u2019s no fun.\u201d She sighed, easily complying with Yoongi. Taehyung and Kevin also looked up, seeing the two getting ready to leave. </p><p>\u201cOh, are you two leaving already? Can we tag along?\u201d Taehyung piped up. Yoongi nodded, motioning them to get ready as well. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just gonna drop Jinhee off and\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cAh, shit. I forgot my keys at my dorm and my roommate\u2019s out on a fucking date.\u201d Jinhee groaned, throwing her head back. \u201cI\u2019ll just sleep in like the lounge or something\u2026\u201d She huffed, but Yoongi\u2019s fist tightened. </p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in my dorm, it\u2019s a single.\u201d Yoongi waved goodbye to everyone, Jinhee\u2019s arm around his shoulder and Kevin and Taehyung trailing behind, suspiciously holding hands with each other. </p><p>\u2014<br></p><p>Once Yoongi checked Jinhee in and bid goodnight to Kevin and Taehyung, the two younger brothers went back to Taehyung\u2019s room, considering that Kevin\u2019s roommates were back and he didn\u2019t want to deal with them just yet. Considering they weren\u2019t as drunk as before, Taehyung felt completely confident in confiding in someone else that wasn\u2019t just his soulmate.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kevin?\u201d Taehyung asked absentmindedly, locking the door behind him. Yeontan saw the two come in and came running over to greet the new guest, Kevin smiling softly when he saw the little ball of fluff hop on his leg. Kevin crouched down, picking up the pomeranian, scratching his chin. \u201cI have a question\u2026\u201d Taehyung bit his lip. The two sat down on the floor in their room, Yeontan running around the two of them. Kevin tilted his head, curious as to what Taehyung had to say.</p><p>\u201cOh? Shoot.\u201d Kevin\u2019s smile sent a little flutter to Taehyung\u2019s stomach. The older\u2019s hands were clasped, trying to calm down. </p><p>\u201cEarlier on the dance floor\u2026 You whispered in my ear and you told me that you really liked me, is that true?\u201d Taehyung stared at his hands. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been thinking about it and maybe I don\u2019t just like girls? I often imagine myself maybe getting with people like you and not just for sex like. I just wanna give you the world sometimes and the fact that you wore real Gucci, and not even that knockoff sh\u2014\u201c Taehyung\u2019s words were cut off by a kiss, his eyes widening. Kevin didn\u2019t feel the kiss being reciprocated, so he began to pull back. Almost frantically, Taehyung pulled him back in for another kiss, sighing in relief. </p><p>They continued to make out for a little, not going any further due to the awkward position of their knees bumping each other from the both of them sitting cross legged and the sheer fatigue both of them were feeling. They both managed to get up and make it onto Taehyung\u2019s bed, soft whispers of \u201ci really like you\u201d and replies of \u201cme too, love\u201d. </p><p>\u2014<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s time for me to take the kids back.\u201d Namjoon stood next to Seokjin, the two of them watching Jimin fuss about the mess in the apartment. Jimin\u2019s punishment, given to him by Seokjin and Hoseok, was to clean up the apartment, which was a mess to say the least. You and Jungkook were sitting on the couch now, holding each other\u2019s hands and half asleep. Seokjin nodded, patting Namjoon on the back. </p><p>\u201cHave a safe trip back up to north campus, alright?\u201d Namjoon only nodded, walking over to you and Jungkook and smiling.</p><p>\u201cHey you two, time to go back up to your dorm.\u201d Namjoon stifled a yawn. You and Jungkook nodded, the both of you getting off the couch. Jimin noticed your figures moving, a pout on his face.</p><p>\u201cAh~ My baby y/n is leaving? Have a safe trip back!\u201d Jimin said cheerfully, although him throwing the cups into the trash bag conveyed that he was just very sad to see you go. You giggled, giving him a tight hug before joining Jungkook and Namjoon at the door. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you when I get back to my dorm to let you know I didn\u2019t die the two blocks back to north campus!\u201d You yelled, grabbing Jungkook\u2019s hand as he balanced you while you slipped your shoes on. The three of you waved to those left in the apartment, starting the walk home. The whole time, you and Jungkook walked ahead of Namjoon, the older one bidding you two a goodnight as soon as you two got back to your dorm. Jungkook scanned his ID at the front of the gate to your dorm, the two of you managing to get back up to the elevators. You didn\u2019t realize that you two lived on the same floor till then, and you only realized it when you both got off at the same floor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to wake up for our 8 am~\u201d Jungkook teased you, adding a cute ending syllable to your name. You blushed a little, giggling before you snuck one last kiss before running into your room. Once the door shut, your grin never fell off your face till you fell asleep, and Jungkook would also have to say the same.</p><p>\u2014<br></p><p>Your alarm sounded at 6:30 am, you groaned squinting at the tiny screen of your phone. Fuck, you had class. You got ready for class half-awake, putting the least amount of effort possible to look presentable to go out. Your mind didn\u2019t register the events from last night until you saw Jungkook walk into class, wearing grey sweats and a white shirt (no surprise there) and making a simple outfit look so fucking good. You, on the other hand, suddenly felt self conscious about your pink hoodie, black leggings, and messy bun. Nonetheless, you waved brightly as you made eye contact with him. Jungkook waved awkwardly, sitting in the front row instead of his usual spot in the back next to you. Your cheeks burned in embarrassment, staring into the back of his head as you wondered why he was acting so weird. He didn\u2019t even respond to the meme you texted him during class, and he always responded to memes.</p><p>Warily, you approached him as class ended, Jungkook had a habit of packing up slowly. \u201cHey, did I do something wrong? You\u2019re acting really weird.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at you, his eyes widening like a deer in headlights, \u201cN-no, you did nothing wrong! Sorry, I just uh\u2026I gotta go, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You frowned as he left the classroom, panic suddenly filling your insides at the events from last night. You cradled your head in your hands, your breath getting shorter as you stressed out. Immediately, you rushed back to your dorm, not having the willpower to go to your next class. After dropping your backpack in your dorm room, you pulled your phone and some headphones out, dialing your Big on FaceTime.</p><p>\u201cMy Little,\u201d she smiled upon answering, \u201cI was meaning to call you last night and tell you that you looked so hot, but I fell asleep and forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnie.\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in your eyes, your voice breaking as you called out her name. Her face broke out in worry, questioning you endlessly as you began to cry. As soon as you regained your breath, you spilled everything about last night and this morning to her, \u201c-I just don\u2019t know if he like regrets having sex with me? Or if he just became friends with me so that we could fuck and now that we have he doesn\u2019t wanna be friends anymore?? Like Jieun unnie, I don\u2019t know what\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, now that sounds ridiculous. Jungkook wouldn\u2019t do that to you, especially since you\u2019re Jimin\u2019s potential little sis. It would ruin their brotherhood if he played you like that,\u201d Jieun said reasonably, \u201cHe\u2019s probably just dealing with his own shit, y/n. I don\u2019t think you should take it personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if-\u201d</p><p>The lounge door slowly opened, the same brown-haired doe-eyed boy that you were ranting about behind the door. He called your name softly, asking if you wanted to talk back in his room. You told your Big you would call her later, furiously wiping away at your tears as you followed him the couple rooms down to his single. You sat down on his bean bag chair as he went to his bed, the atmosphere awkward as he stared at you sniffling across from him.</p><p>\u201cy/n-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I bad yesterday? Like was I just a really bad fuck?\u201d You blurted, eyes puffy from crying.</p><p>He shook his head, both hands mirroring the movement as he continuously denied your statement, \u201cNo y/n, you were, wow, amazing. It was honestly the best I\u2019ve had. I just\u2026like\u2026isn\u2019t drunk sex nonconsensual??\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like I took advantage of you or something, especially since you\u2019re basically Jimin hyung\u2019s little. And I made you cry too, like-\u201d He stopped as you started giggling, confused at your change of emotion.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I wanted everything that we did yesterday. I don\u2019t regret any single part of it.\u201d You said, \u201cit\u2019s cute that you would worry about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, we did agree on a round two, didn\u2019t we?\u201d You said with a little smirk, wiping away any leftover tears from your face.</p><p>He chuckled, scratching the back of his neck, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you cry. Trust me, that was the last thing I ever wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>You crossed your arms, \u201cThat\u2019s because I thought you hated me or maybe you thought I was ugly, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, y/n, and you are nowhere near ugly.\u201d He said grabbing your hands to pull you up for a hug. You wrapped your arms around his waist, your body suddenly hyperaware of his abdomen pressing against you. He relaxed, resting his chin on top of your head. \u201cSo, daddy kink, huh?\u201d</p><p>You shoved him away while laughing, but he caught the blush on your cheeks. You told him to shut up, threatening to tell the boys about what happened.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d be in more trouble than me, y/n.\u201d He chuckled, \u201cbesides, I think they already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do? Jimin oppa<i> knows</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were all pretty drunk last night, y/n. Apparently even Jinhee noona slapped Yoongi hyung.\u201d He said, your mouth making an O shape at the new piece of information. The both of you casually sat down on his bed, suddenly not knowing what to say. </p><p>\u201cSo, uh, what do you wanna do about last night?\u201d He asked, fingers playing with the ends of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you said carefully, \u201cwhat can we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can either pretend it never happened, say it was a one time thing, or I don\u2019t know, maybe we can make a deal.\u201d He said, his voice trailing at the end.</p><p>You raised your eyebrow, \u201cWhat kind of deal? Like, be fuck buddies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah.\u201d He said, a flash of confidence in his tone, \u201cCollege and Greek life is stressful, and having someone to relieve stress with - that isn\u2019t a stranger - could be beneficial. For the both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck around with many guys, Jeon. Even though drunk me may act differently.\u201d You said seriously, \u201cyou\u2019re a sweet friend, but I know your previous sex stories and I\u2019m not the kind of girl who waits to be someone\u2019s safe backup when they get rejected by someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear y/n, if you agree to this, you\u2019ll be the only girl I\u2019ll be with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But if I see you hook up with someone else at a party, I\u2019ll beat you up before Jimin oppa can.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, completely hooked by your feistiness. \u201cDeal, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u2014<br></p><p>The first thing Jinhee felt when she woke up was the head splitting headache. She groaned, the feeling of death washing over her senses.</p><p>Right\u2026 That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t drink. The pounding in her ears seemed to almost be unbearable, but the warmth on top of her head helped aid the headache.</p><p>Wait\u2014 Why was there something warm on her head?</p><p>Jinhee mentally prepared herself for the light, opening her eyes to see a pair of green cat eyes looking back at her curiously. Immediately, instead of freaking out, she only tensed for a split moment before reaching up to the cat on her chest, her hand in a loosely covered fist. The grey cat saw the movement, only registering it for a few seconds before it began to nuzzle into her hand. Jinhee softened, scratching the cheek of the cat. It was only then that Jinhee saw the sleeves of the dark green sweater she was wearing. Last she remembered, she never owned a dark green champion crewneck. Immediately, she sat up, squinting as she didn\u2019t have her contacts in. She looked around the room, hazy memories of her making out with someone making her heartbeat speed up. The cat, which had hopped off her chest as soon as she sat up only looked back at her in curiosity before her eyes landed on the sleeping figure on the couch across from the single desk in the room. </p><p>There was Min Yoongi, sleeping casually on the couch. She connected two and two, recognizing the cat to be his own, Killmonger. The said cat hopped onto the couch, kneading at the throw blanket on top of the sleeping pianist. Jinhee\u2019s face went red, watching as he woke up. Yoongi woke up slowly, sitting up and looking over at the blushing singer.</p><p>\u201cMm, good morning, Jinhee.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s morning voice sent shivers down Jinhee\u2019s spine, the younger one\u2019s mind already going a million miles a minute. </p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 Did we do something last night? Why am I here? Why didn\u2019t you just leave me at Seokjin\u2019s place?\u201d Jinhee was asking too many questions for her head to be in that much pain and for Yoongi just waking up. Yoongi gave a little chuckle, his hand casually scratching his cat\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened, but you did almost strip in front of me after complaining dresses were too confining, hence my sweater and a pair of shorts a girl left behind some months ago \u2013 don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s washed.\u201d Jinhee felt a twinge of jealousy, only casually gripping at the cuffs of the sweater before releasing her fists. </p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t explain how I got here! I remember making out with someone, was that someone you? Oh my god, did Killmonger watch us?\u201d Jinhee interrogated. This time, it was Yoongi\u2019s turn to tense up. He stopped scratching Killmonger for a little too long, the cat sliding out of his hand. After the flash of anger subsided, Yoongi only chuckled. </p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me. To explain, you slapped the shit out of me because I didn\u2019t let you change the music and Seokjin just told me to bring you home\u2026 Which, by the way, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t let you change the music, although, I don\u2019t think sober you wouldn\u2019t put up as much of a fuss as drunk you did.\u201d His explanation only made Jinhee more embarrassed hearing about her drunk. She looked down, playing with the hem of the sweater.</p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s okay, I guess.\u201d Jinhee\u2019s words barely came out above a whisper, but it was loud enough that Yoongi could hear her. She swung her feet over to grab her (charging, she might add) phone. Her eyes widened at the time, \u201coh fuck, my shift starts in an hour\u2026\u201d She scrambled over to the door, wincing when she put the high heels back on and grabbed her dress from the desk chair. \u201cThank god I live across the street, right?\u201d She laughed a little uncomfortably, Yoongi trailing behind her so he could check her out of the building. He grabbed onto a little gift before they both left his dorm, the both of them going into the elevator and heading down.</p><p>He gave the RA on duty a little nod as she grabbed her ID, his fist clenching a little around the gift for her.</p><p>\u201cJinhee.\u201d Yoongi finally mustered the courage to say her name, the younger one spinning around in curiosity and almost losing her balance. Jinhee tilted her head, watching Yoongi retrieve a little gift bag from his pocket. Inside the clear cellophane bag was some matcha shortbread cookies, haphazardly covered in white chocolate and the bag was tied off with a ribbon wrapping and her name written messily on a card. \u201cI forgot to give this to you yesterday, uh. Happy Valentines day?\u201d </p><p>Jinhee\u2019s heart softened at the bag of cookies, taking it with a smile. \u201cY-Yeah, happy Valentines, Yoongi.\u201d Their hands lingered on each other for just the slightest bit before she raised her other hand to wave goodbye, running across the street to her dorm. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t till she got home and looked at herself in the mirror when she realized she was barefaced, meaning he had wiped off her makeup while she was sleeping. Her mouth curved into a small smile once more, putting on her regular makeup and her glasses before changing into pants. She opted to wear the same sweatshirt (it fits my hair color, she convinced herself), grabbing her backpack with Yoongi\u2019s cookies in it and keys before slipping on her shoes and leaving her dorm. </p><p>\u2014<br></p><p><i>2-14-19</i></p><p><i>happy valentines day everyone :)</i></p>",

(Valentines Day Special Part 2)</b></p><p><b>genre: smut, fluff, angst?<br>word count: 6.8k<br>warnings: swearing, underaged drinking, sex</b></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>YOUR POV</p><p>Although most of you had a cocktail or two during the dinner, the real drinking was about to start now back at Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s apartment. Before you all got to it, though, of course you spent at least 30 minutes taking pictures at the apartment\u2019s infamous \u201cmarble tapestry wall\u201d. It wasn\u2019t every day that the ten of you stunted like that.</p><p>\u201cWait, can I have a picture with Jungkook?\u201d You asked shyly, \u201cWe\u2019re matching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Yoongi cracked a grin, holding up his camera as you posed hugging Jungkook\u2019s waist. The boy stiffened as he felt your body lean against his, cheeks flushing as his stare flickered to your plunging neckline and how close it was to his chest. He cleared his throat, trying to channel the confidence that he usually received when dancing, and slung his arms around your shoulder, the corner of his right lip curving upwards into a smirk. \u201cSmile kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough pictures,\u201d Tae complained taking off his shoes and socks and standing on the couch, \u201clet\u2019s fucking drink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is taking a shot, and I literally mean everyone. That means you too, Jinhee.\u201d Hoseok said pulling her up from where she was sitting. The girl shrugged, one shot wouldn\u2019t kill her. The ten of you gathered in a circle, shots in one hand and phones in the other. The flashes turned on and you cheered, clinking shot drinks with several of the boys before downing it one gulp. Your face scrunched up in disgust at the burning taste of tequila, waving your hand for some water to chase it down. </p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s take another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down there, y/n.\u201d Seokjin laughed patting your back, \u201care you trying to get hammered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a rough week, I\u2019m ready to drown in alcohol.\u201d You said pouring yourself another shot and taking it without a second thought. Kevin, Jimin, and Jinhee started to scold you, threatening to leave you in your own vomit if you didn\u2019t pace yourself.</p><p>Hoseok laughed, \u201cLast time you got wasted, you offered to suck my dick, y/n.\u201d You apologized defending yourself with<i> sorry, I\u2019m a flirty drunk</i> \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, I was gonna let you. Although tonight, it might not be me you\u2019re going after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that, oppa?\u201d </p><p>Before Hoseok could answer, Yoongi played a song that brought you to your feet. Pulling the body closest in your vicinity up with you, you began swaying to the beat, facing the boy whose blue button up resembled your mini dress. \u201cDance with me Kook, I know you can.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, I wanna take another shot,\u201d He said inwardly begging for the alcohol to kick in. You agreed with a smile, entering and leaving the kitchen within minutes before taking hold of Jungkook\u2019s hand, using it as a leverage to spin around. By this point all of you were dancing and slowly but surely getting quite intoxicated. You couldn\u2019t help but stay close to Jungkook, the image of him getting more attractive as the minutes passed by. The room was beginning to get hazy as the alcohol took over your judgement. </p><p>Jungkook didn\u2019t seem to be faring any better against the liquid as his hold on your waist tightened and his gaze intensified. The sparkly innocent doe eyes you were usually met with now a different, dark, and seductive look. His eyes mimicked how you would see them when he performed and you would be lying if you said that they didn\u2019t turn you on in the slightest. He leaned closer to you, making you shiver with his breath against your ear, \u201ccan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>You nod in anticipation, your heart pounding by how close he was, \u201cI want to kiss you so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He smirked leaving their makeshift dance floor to go downstairs to the basement, his eyes telling you to follow him after a few minutes - not that any of the boys or Jinhee would notice, they were caught up in their own drunk antics anyway. Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s basement was alright, but there were two other rooms that they converted into more guest bedrooms for when the boys slept over. Going inside the first one, you let out a small \u201coh\u201d as you spotted Jungkook sitting at the edge of the bed, legs spread and arms leaning back against the duvet, \u201cI was beginning to think you weren\u2019t going to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been 5 minutes,\u201d you crossed your arms, all your weight resting on one leg. The room screamed Seokjin, the walls a nice millennial shade of pink and the furniture statement pieces. The center point of the whole room was the bed with a crown shaped headboard, directly above it hung a banner that said BT\u03a3. The boy chuckled and stood, towering over you with his large frame. Slowly, he brought his hand to your chin, tilting your head upwards to meet his lips.</p><p>The kiss was soft and sweet, nothing like the fiery stares and burning touches that he left on your body earlier tonight. He pulled away much too quickly for your liking, letting out a small whine at the loss of contact. Jungkook found it amusing teasing you, the look in his eyes now playful instead of seductive.</p><p>But no, you were not settling with a cute little peck. Almost aggressively, you cupped his cheeks and brought his lips in for another kiss, the force you put against his body enough to make him fall back on the bed. Immediately, you brought your legs to both sides of his lap, straddling him as your arms snaked around his neck. Jungkook\u2019s hands instinctively gripped your waist, barely hovering over the top of your ass. Your lips moved almost desperately against each other, tongues fighting and searching over every crevice of each others\u2019 mouths. Your hands were entangled in his hair, the boy letting out a groan when you tugged on it slightly.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You felt that hit your core.</p><p>\u201cy/n,\u201d He breathed out, thrusting up to grind his pelvis against yours. You gasped at the sudden amount of pleasure, your body falling forward against his chest, causing the boy to bite your shoulder in response. This time it was your turn to moan, the sound going straight to his dick. \u201cHold on, I want to make sure you\u2019re okay with this. I don\u2019t want to make you do anything you don\u2019t want to or push you to go farther than you intend to go-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKook, you\u2019re incredibly sweet and it honestly means the world to me that you\u2019re asking, but I trust you. I know what kind of person you are, and I want nothing more in this moment than for you to fuck me. Don\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>It was as if a switch went off in Jungkook\u2019s head, his gaze looking more predatory than ever. His hands went from your waist to your ass, taking fistfuls of your cheeks and squeezing. Your dress was ridden up to your stomach by now, showing the full view of your black Victoria\u2019s Secret thong that you thank god decided to wear. With a smirk, he slipped two fingers under the string, bringing it out far enough so that a light smack resonated the bedroom. \u201cAs much as I love this dress on you, I think it needs to go, don\u2019t you think baby girl?\u201d</p><p>Your stomach churned at the pet name he gave you, your hands swiftly crossing across your body to remove your dress before he even had the chance. His eyes shamelessly stared at your bare chest, one hand moving up to knead your breast, his index finger and thumb playing with your nipple. You bit your lip at the stimulation, impatiently trying to rid the boy of his own button up.</p><p>Before you could rip his shirt open, he flipped you over, your back hitting the mattress with a soft thud. He stood up and went to make sure the door was locked, going back to the edge of the bed soon after. His hands went to his shirt buttons, giving you a little strip show before the fabric fell to the floor. Sitting up on your elbows, you watched as he moved on to his pants, slipping off his belt before undoing his pants and zipper, stepping out of his tight black jeans.</p><p>Jungkook rejoined you on the bed, his lips attached to yours as his hands roamed your body. His mouth ghosted over your jawline to your neck, sucking harshly intending to leave several marks. You threw your head back, taking fistfuls of the duvet as one of his hands cupped your core, moving your thong to the side and prodding two fingers at your entrance. It was embarrassing how wet you were, but at that moment, you really couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>His fingers made figure eights on your clit, making you squirm in response. Smiling against your neck, he thrusted his fingers into your pussy, biting at the already abused flesh of your neck as you let out a rather loud moan. You were thankful that the music upstairs was still blasting otherwise the whole apartment would have just heard you.</p><p>You reached for his crotch with one hand, squeezing his member through his boxers. Jungkook let out a <i>fuck</i>, hastily removing the last of both of your undergarments. Your eyes bulged at his dick, although not the biggest you\u2019ve ever seen, it was definitely on the girthy side. Impatiently, he went to the drawer and pulled out a condom, rolling it onto his length before lining it up with your entrance. You put your hand on his chest, motioning for him to stop, \u201cwait. Jungkook, I want to suck your dick-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck as much as I would love for you to do that, y/n, I need to be inside you right now. We\u2019ll do that next time,\u201d He said moving his tip up and down your slit, making sure it was well-lubricated enough to slide in. You gasped as his dick slowly entered you, feeling the burning stretch almost immediately. As soon as he was buried to the hilt, you clenched your pussy making him moan. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJungkook<i> please</i> move,\u201d you whined thrusting your hips up. The boy grabbed your arms, pinning them against the mattress as he started to thrust at a leisurely pace. \u201cJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go faster baby girl?\u201d He asked with a smirk, staring down at you authoritatively. You nodded, now that you were used to his length, you needed him to just wreck you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy please</i>.\u201d</p><p>With the magic word, he rested his forehead against yours, keeping eye contact with you as his pace rapidly quickened. Anyone who said sex intoxicated is a bad idea, has clearly never had sex with Jeon Jungkook. Every time he thrusted back in, his tip lightly grazed over your g spot, your stomach tightening in record time.</p><p>You clenched your stomach as your high approached, the sudden tightness making Jungkook drill into you even faster, chasing his own climax. You moaned into his shoulder as you came, the boy muffling curses against your neck as he released into the condom. He rested on top of you, keeping his length in you for a few moments more before he had to pull out.</p><p>You were feeling a little bit more sober now, your body still laying down. Jungkook stood and removed the condom, throwing it away in the trash bin before finding some tissues and wiping his length of any cum. Taking an additional few tissues, he returned to where you laid and started wiping your core clean, your body wincing from sensitivity. He apologized with a sweet smile, tossing the tissues before coming back to join you on the bed.</p><p>The sweet doe-eyed boy was back, even with how incredibly sinful he looked naked. Jungkook stared at you as you sat up, admiring how breathtaking you looked post-sex. You chuckled and moved closer, hugging his waist, \u201cdo you think they\u2019re looking for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d He shrugged wrapping his arms around your body. \u201cWe should probably go back.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and pressed a soft kiss on his cheek, \u201cYeah, we should, daddy.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed as you searched for your dress and thong, \u201cDon\u2019t say that unless you want a round two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I don\u2019t?\u201d </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cYooooongi.\u201d Jinhee laid down dramatically from her seated position on the couch, her head hitting Yoongi\u2019s thighs. Yoongi\u2019s slowly sobering attention went to the silver haired girl, looking down and tilting his head when she drawled out his name. \u201cWhy the hell are you playing so much rap? It\u2019s thotty hours, we should be playing some fuckin\u2019\u2026 Trap or some shit. Give me the fucking phone.\u201d Her hands reached out for the phone in Yoongi\u2019s hand, the phone only lifting slightly so that it was out of her reach. His phone was the only one connected to the house\u2019s speaker, and he was confused as to why she suddenly had a problem with the music. </p><p>Jinhee whined, sitting back up and reaching for his phone once more. Once she was basically on his lap, she finally got a hold of his phone, trying to unlock it. Yoongi sighed, holding his hand out. </p><p>\u201cJinhee, my lineage are the only people who can unlock it, give me back my phone.\u201d Yoongi managed to muster at least a little bit of authority in his voice, grabbing for his phone from the younger one. Jinhee only kept swerving, getting up and stumbling around to avoid Yoongi grabbing for his phone. He only followed after her slowly, watching her stumble around. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? Why won\u2019t it unlock?! I won\u2019t until we play fucking something else! Alexa, play<i> Reel It In</i> by Amine!\u201d Jinhee managed to yell that over the music, frowning when she didn\u2019t get a response back. Yoongi furrowed his brows. Seokjin and Hoseok didn\u2019t have an Alexa in the first place, so where did Jinhee get that idea? </p><p>\u201cJinhee, maybe you need to drink some water\u2026\u201c Yoongi started, swiping his phone from her. He tucked his phone away and reached towards Jinhee. She squinted, pushing the general direction of Yoongi\u2019s hands away. </p><p>\u201cBitch, why the fuck are you trying to touch me? Weird ass creep!\u201d A hand flew in the air, and a crisp smack resonated through the room.</p><p>If Yoongi wasn\u2019t completely sober before then, he clearly was now. He stood there in shock, trying to process what was happening, but everything after that felt like it was happening in slow motion. Jinhee attempted to jump on him to hit him more, but she was held back by Jimin, who was oddly concerned about her. </p><p>\u201cWoah woah calm down Jinhee! You know what? You need to calm down, let\u2019s go to Jin hyung\u2019s room.\u201d Jimin said softly, spinning her around and leading her to Seokjin\u2019s room. His hand settled on the small of her back, making Yoongi shift uncomfortably.</p><p>He sat back down on the couch, sighing slowly in defeat. Namjoon came over a few beats later with a bag of frozen pineapple from the freezer, gently pressing it to the reddening skin of Yoongi\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\u201cHyung, are you good?\u201d Namjoon took Yoongi\u2019s phone, changing the music but to something calmer. The party that the 10 of them were hosting had been dying down for a little now, since you, Jungkook, Jimin, and Jinhee were missing from the main scene. Yoongi only frowned, shaking his head. </p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve met a violent drunk\u2026\u201d Yoongi laughs a little, throwing his head back. </p><p>\u201cYou know what, I didn\u2019t expect that from her.\u201d Seokjin laughed, settling on Yoongi\u2019s other side. Yoongi held the frozen pineapple, letting Namjoon\u2019s hand rest. Seokjin was only slightly tipsy and Namjoon, after hitting the wall, decided he was done with alcohol for the night, so he was also sobering up with the two seniors. </p><p>\u201cI feel really bad though\u2026\u201d Yoongi frowned, leaning forward so that his elbows rested on his thighs. He set down the bag of frozen pineapple, burying his face into his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her hating me for anything, it\u2019s just hard forming words around her and her and Jimin kinda make me upset, is that weird? I\u2019ve been floored by her voice for like. Months now. I caught her singing late in the practice rooms one night while I was figuring out my rep for my last recital and I just fell in love with her voice\u2014 and to now put a face to that voice? Jinhee\u2019s an angel and I feel bad for making her mad\u2026\u201d Yoongi sighed, massaging his temples. This wasn\u2019t the first time Seokjin had heard Yoongi talk about his best friend like this, but hearing it sober for the first time was almost unbearable. </p><p>\u201cYoongi, I love you, but you need to apologize to her. And maybe confess to her. Maybe dick her down.\u201d Seokjin patted Yoongi gently, the younger one\u2019s face going red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that second one! I don\u2019t know about that last one!\u201d He exclaimed, a smile cracking on Seokjin\u2019s face. Yoongi stood up, hyping himself up to go into the room.</p><p>In the room, however, Jinhee was still as heated as she was before, pacing back and forth in Seokjin\u2019s room. Jimin watched her pace and babble from Seokjin\u2019s gaming chair, casually biting his lower lip while he eyed the singer. </p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck was he being so mean to me? He fucking started it. He wouldn\u2019t let me fucking change the song?? It literally takes like 2 seconds to unlock his fucking phone. I fucking hate him? And don\u2019t get me fucking started on how much I want to kiss him! Have you seen his hands? I don\u2019t even know if I want them on my neck choking me hard enough that I have to learn how to do actual makeup to match my neck or if I just want to hold them!\u201d She exhaled loudly, stopping in front of Seokjin\u2019s bedside table. She eyed the picture of Seokjin and Yoongi from their reveal for Beta Tau their freshman year, picking the frame up. </p><p>She made the motion to throw it down, but right when she was about to drop it, a hand wrapped around her wrist, spinning her around so that she was face to face with Jimin. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so reckless sometimes, you know that, Jinhee darling?\u201d His hands pried the framed picture away from her hands, setting the frame back down on the bedside table, only face down so that it wouldn\u2019t crack. \u201cI promised the hyungs I\u2019d calm you down, so why don\u2019t you sit down? I know the perfect way to calm you down.\u201d His eyes glinted with a little bit of mischief, pushing her gently onto the bed. Once she was sitting, he pushed her slightly, letting her move so that she was backing up and sitting with her back leaning on the sea of pillows propped up on the bed frame. He crawled over Jinhee, making her blush and look away. </p><p>Jimin only chuckled, using one of his fingers to trace her jawline before tilting her head gently so that they were making eye contact again while the other kept him steady holding the bed frame. \u201cTrust me, I know exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d He leaned in close, hearing Jinhee suck in a breath. Another chuckle. </p><p>Jimin began to pepper small kisses along Jinhee\u2019s jawline and down her neck, stopping occasionally on her neck to bite down, but not enough to make a mark. A small moan escaped her lips, her body becoming like putty in his arms as she tilted her head back so that he could have more room. He pulled away, cupping her cheeks. </p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Jimin carefully asked. His lips ghosted over hers, causing Jinhee to nod eagerly, her eyes matching his with full blown lust. Jinhee closed the gap between them almost desperately, sighing in bliss when he began kissing back, her arms wrapping around his waist. </p><p>Jimin\u2019s hands moved sensually against her body, his fingertips already playing with the edge of her dress. Lifting it up, his hands lightly moved up and down the outside of her thighs before moving inside to spread her legs apart. \u201cJimin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help you relax, baby.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her once more, expertly moving his lips as his hand stayed on Jinhee\u2019s inner thigh. She sighed in content as the older boy finally pressed his fingers against the cloth of her underwear, \u201cI can feel how wet you are, baby.\u201d</p><p>She blushed at his comment, turning her head away to the side. He only grinned, moving downwards so that he was face to face with her core. Jimin looped his fingers around the sides of her panties, licking his lips in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jinhee?\u201d The door opened suddenly, Yoongi standing at the doorway with Seokjin. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Seokjin said shocked at the sight of his brother about to eat out his best friend. Jinhee sat up abruptly quick, her face burning. </p><p>\u201cI need to. Bathroom. Attempt to die by eating Seokjin\u2019s lemon soaps.\u201d She muttered quickly, speeding through into the private bathroom. Once the door closed, Yoongi stomped up to Jimin, grabbing him by the collar. </p><p>\u201cYou. Absolute. Fuck.\u201d Yoongi growled, Seokjin stood next to Yoongi, hoping he wouldn\u2019t beat his brother up. \u201cWhat the fuck were you trying to do with her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was trying to make her relax, hyung. Isn\u2019t that what I promised?\u201d Jimin said quite casually. Yoongi paused for a minute, letting go of his collar. Jinhee peeked her head out of the bathroom, slowly trying to sneak out incognito. She managed to slip past the three, praying constantly that the floors wouldn\u2019t creak. She successfully snuck out, relaxing and going over to the couch where Namjoon sat, scrolling through his phone. Kevin, Taehyung, and Hoseok were engrossed in a game of Cards Against Humanity on the floor, so Jinhee sat next to Namjoon. She sighed, taking the plush that rested on the couch and mashing its face in. \u201cHookup culture is fucking weird, Joon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me. Have you seen y/n and Jungkook? I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re partaking in said culture.\u201d Namjoon counted heads, clicking his tongue.</p><p>Back in Seokjin\u2019s room, Jimin, Seokjin, and Yoongi were still in the same predicament, Yoongi\u2019s arms crossed as he towered over Jimin.</p><p>\u201cPark Jimin. You know she was intoxicated. So why did you still try taking advantage of her?\u201d Yoongi sighed, mussing up his own hair. The younger one shrugged, smirking a little at Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cShe was extremely willing to let me use my ways to calm her down. Why are you so mad, hm? Not like you like her or anything, right?\u201d Jimin asked rhetorically, before seeing the change in Yoongi\u2019s face. \u201cOh? Did I strike a chord?\u201d Jimin asked innocently, smiling lazily at Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cJimin, you\u2019re drunk. Apologize to him,\u201d Seokjin said firmly, holding back Yoongi from doing anything irrational. Jimin shrugged again, leaning back on his propped arms. </p><p>\u201cYou know what? It\u2019s whatever, I\u2019m just gonna take her home and apologize in the morning.\u201d Yoongi left the room, not wanting to deal with his brother anymore. </p><p>Yoongi walked back into the living room, where Jungkook and you were finally back up in, looking a little presentable in comparison to what you two were just doing. You two had joined the three playing the card game on the floor, Namjoon and Jinhee watching a video on Namjoon\u2019s phone. The party had died down considerably, making Yoongi sigh. It was still a weekday so he justified his next move, walking up to Jinhee who only eyed him and crossed her arms. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to take you back to your dorm, Seokjin said you had a shift tomorrow.\u201d Yoongi started off carefully. Jinhee didn\u2019t seem to object, instead, she sat up from resting on Namjoon\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cAlready? Jinnie\u2019s no fun.\u201d She sighed, easily complying with Yoongi. Taehyung and Kevin also looked up, seeing the two getting ready to leave. </p><p>\u201cOh, are you two leaving already? Can we tag along?\u201d Taehyung piped up. Yoongi nodded, motioning them to get ready as well. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just gonna drop Jinhee off and\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cAh, shit. I forgot my keys at my dorm and my roommate\u2019s out on a fucking date.\u201d Jinhee groaned, throwing her head back. \u201cI\u2019ll just sleep in like the lounge or something\u2026\u201d She huffed, but Yoongi\u2019s fist tightened. </p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in my dorm, it\u2019s a single.\u201d Yoongi waved goodbye to everyone, Jinhee\u2019s arm around his shoulder and Kevin and Taehyung trailing behind, suspiciously holding hands with each other. </p><p>\u2014<br></p><p>Once Yoongi checked Jinhee in and bid goodnight to Kevin and Taehyung, the two younger brothers went back to Taehyung\u2019s room, considering that Kevin\u2019s roommates were back and he didn\u2019t want to deal with them just yet. Considering they weren\u2019t as drunk as before, Taehyung felt completely confident in confiding in someone else that wasn\u2019t just his soulmate.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kevin?\u201d Taehyung asked absentmindedly, locking the door behind him. Yeontan saw the two come in and came running over to greet the new guest, Kevin smiling softly when he saw the little ball of fluff hop on his leg. Kevin crouched down, picking up the pomeranian, scratching his chin. \u201cI have a question\u2026\u201d Taehyung bit his lip. The two sat down on the floor in their room, Yeontan running around the two of them. Kevin tilted his head, curious as to what Taehyung had to say.</p><p>\u201cOh? Shoot.\u201d Kevin\u2019s smile sent a little flutter to Taehyung\u2019s stomach. The older\u2019s hands were clasped, trying to calm down. </p><p>\u201cEarlier on the dance floor\u2026 You whispered in my ear and you told me that you really liked me, is that true?\u201d Taehyung stared at his hands. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been thinking about it and maybe I don\u2019t just like girls? I often imagine myself maybe getting with people like you and not just for sex like. I just wanna give you the world sometimes and the fact that you wore real Gucci, and not even that knockoff sh\u2014\u201c Taehyung\u2019s words were cut off by a kiss, his eyes widening. Kevin didn\u2019t feel the kiss being reciprocated, so he began to pull back. Almost frantically, Taehyung pulled him back in for another kiss, sighing in relief. </p><p>They continued to make out for a little, not going any further due to the awkward position of their knees bumping each other from the both of them sitting cross legged and the sheer fatigue both of them were feeling. They both managed to get up and make it onto Taehyung\u2019s bed, soft whispers of \u201ci really like you\u201d and replies of \u201cme too, love\u201d. </p><p>\u2014<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s time for me to take the kids back.\u201d Namjoon stood next to Seokjin, the two of them watching Jimin fuss about the mess in the apartment. Jimin\u2019s punishment, given to him by Seokjin and Hoseok, was to clean up the apartment, which was a mess to say the least. You and Jungkook were sitting on the couch now, holding each other\u2019s hands and half asleep. Seokjin nodded, patting Namjoon on the back. </p><p>\u201cHave a safe trip back up to north campus, alright?\u201d Namjoon only nodded, walking over to you and Jungkook and smiling.</p><p>\u201cHey you two, time to go back up to your dorm.\u201d Namjoon stifled a yawn. You and Jungkook nodded, the both of you getting off the couch. Jimin noticed your figures moving, a pout on his face.</p><p>\u201cAh~ My baby y/n is leaving? Have a safe trip back!\u201d Jimin said cheerfully, although him throwing the cups into the trash bag conveyed that he was just very sad to see you go. You giggled, giving him a tight hug before joining Jungkook and Namjoon at the door. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you when I get back to my dorm to let you know I didn\u2019t die the two blocks back to north campus!\u201d You yelled, grabbing Jungkook\u2019s hand as he balanced you while you slipped your shoes on. The three of you waved to those left in the apartment, starting the walk home. The whole time, you and Jungkook walked ahead of Namjoon, the older one bidding you two a goodnight as soon as you two got back to your dorm. Jungkook scanned his ID at the front of the gate to your dorm, the two of you managing to get back up to the elevators. You didn\u2019t realize that you two lived on the same floor till then, and you only realized it when you both got off at the same floor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to wake up for our 8 am~\u201d Jungkook teased you, adding a cute ending syllable to your name. You blushed a little, giggling before you snuck one last kiss before running into your room. Once the door shut, your grin never fell off your face till you fell asleep, and Jungkook would also have to say the same.</p><p>\u2014<br></p><p>Your alarm sounded at 6:30 am, you groaned squinting at the tiny screen of your phone. Fuck, you had class. You got ready for class half-awake, putting the least amount of effort possible to look presentable to go out. Your mind didn\u2019t register the events from last night until you saw Jungkook walk into class, wearing grey sweats and a white shirt (no surprise there) and making a simple outfit look so fucking good. You, on the other hand, suddenly felt self conscious about your pink hoodie, black leggings, and messy bun. Nonetheless, you waved brightly as you made eye contact with him. Jungkook waved awkwardly, sitting in the front row instead of his usual spot in the back next to you. Your cheeks burned in embarrassment, staring into the back of his head as you wondered why he was acting so weird. He didn\u2019t even respond to the meme you texted him during class, and he always responded to memes.</p><p>Warily, you approached him as class ended, Jungkook had a habit of packing up slowly. \u201cHey, did I do something wrong? You\u2019re acting really weird.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at you, his eyes widening like a deer in headlights, \u201cN-no, you did nothing wrong! Sorry, I just uh\u2026I gotta go, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You frowned as he left the classroom, panic suddenly filling your insides at the events from last night. You cradled your head in your hands, your breath getting shorter as you stressed out. Immediately, you rushed back to your dorm, not having the willpower to go to your next class. After dropping your backpack in your dorm room, you pulled your phone and some headphones out, dialing your Big on FaceTime.</p><p>\u201cMy Little,\u201d she smiled upon answering, \u201cI was meaning to call you last night and tell you that you looked so hot, but I fell asleep and forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnie.\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in your eyes, your voice breaking as you called out her name. Her face broke out in worry, questioning you endlessly as you began to cry. As soon as you regained your breath, you spilled everything about last night and this morning to her, \u201c-I just don\u2019t know if he like regrets having sex with me? Or if he just became friends with me so that we could fuck and now that we have he doesn\u2019t wanna be friends anymore?? Like Jieun unnie, I don\u2019t know what\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, now that sounds ridiculous. Jungkook wouldn\u2019t do that to you, especially since you\u2019re Jimin\u2019s potential little sis. It would ruin their brotherhood if he played you like that,\u201d Jieun said reasonably, \u201cHe\u2019s probably just dealing with his own shit, y/n. I don\u2019t think you should take it personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if-\u201d</p><p>The lounge door slowly opened, the same brown-haired doe-eyed boy that you were ranting about behind the door. He called your name softly, asking if you wanted to talk back in his room. You told your Big you would call her later, furiously wiping away at your tears as you followed him the couple rooms down to his single. You sat down on his bean bag chair as he went to his bed, the atmosphere awkward as he stared at you sniffling across from him.</p><p>\u201cy/n-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I bad yesterday? Like was I just a really bad fuck?\u201d You blurted, eyes puffy from crying.</p><p>He shook his head, both hands mirroring the movement as he continuously denied your statement, \u201cNo y/n, you were, wow, amazing. It was honestly the best I\u2019ve had. I just\u2026like\u2026isn\u2019t drunk sex nonconsensual??\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like I took advantage of you or something, especially since you\u2019re basically Jimin hyung\u2019s little. And I made you cry too, like-\u201d He stopped as you started giggling, confused at your change of emotion.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I wanted everything that we did yesterday. I don\u2019t regret any single part of it.\u201d You said, \u201cit\u2019s cute that you would worry about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, we did agree on a round two, didn\u2019t we?\u201d You said with a little smirk, wiping away any leftover tears from your face.</p><p>He chuckled, scratching the back of his neck, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you cry. Trust me, that was the last thing I ever wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>You crossed your arms, \u201cThat\u2019s because I thought you hated me or maybe you thought I was ugly, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, y/n, and you are nowhere near ugly.\u201d He said grabbing your hands to pull you up for a hug. You wrapped your arms around his waist, your body suddenly hyperaware of his abdomen pressing against you. He relaxed, resting his chin on top of your head. \u201cSo, daddy kink, huh?\u201d</p><p>You shoved him away while laughing, but he caught the blush on your cheeks. You told him to shut up, threatening to tell the boys about what happened.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d be in more trouble than me, y/n.\u201d He chuckled, \u201cbesides, I think they already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do? Jimin oppa<i> knows</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were all pretty drunk last night, y/n. Apparently even Jinhee noona slapped Yoongi hyung.\u201d He said, your mouth making an O shape at the new piece of information. The both of you casually sat down on his bed, suddenly not knowing what to say. </p><p>\u201cSo, uh, what do you wanna do about last night?\u201d He asked, fingers playing with the ends of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you said carefully, \u201cwhat can we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can either pretend it never happened, say it was a one time thing, or I don\u2019t know, maybe we can make a deal.\u201d He said, his voice trailing at the end.</p><p>You raised your eyebrow, \u201cWhat kind of deal? Like, be fuck buddies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah.\u201d He said, a flash of confidence in his tone, \u201cCollege and Greek life is stressful, and having someone to relieve stress with - that isn\u2019t a stranger - could be beneficial. For the both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck around with many guys, Jeon. Even though drunk me may act differently.\u201d You said seriously, \u201cyou\u2019re a sweet friend, but I know your previous sex stories and I\u2019m not the kind of girl who waits to be someone\u2019s safe backup when they get rejected by someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear y/n, if you agree to this, you\u2019ll be the only girl I\u2019ll be with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But if I see you hook up with someone else at a party, I\u2019ll beat you up before Jimin oppa can.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, completely hooked by your feistiness. \u201cDeal, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u2014<br></p><p>The first thing Jinhee felt when she woke up was the head splitting headache. She groaned, the feeling of death washing over her senses.</p><p>Right\u2026 That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t drink. The pounding in her ears seemed to almost be unbearable, but the warmth on top of her head helped aid the headache.</p><p>Wait\u2014 Why was there something warm on her head?</p><p>Jinhee mentally prepared herself for the light, opening her eyes to see a pair of green cat eyes looking back at her curiously. Immediately, instead of freaking out, she only tensed for a split moment before reaching up to the cat on her chest, her hand in a loosely covered fist. The grey cat saw the movement, only registering it for a few seconds before it began to nuzzle into her hand. Jinhee softened, scratching the cheek of the cat. It was only then that Jinhee saw the sleeves of the dark green sweater she was wearing. Last she remembered, she never owned a dark green champion crewneck. Immediately, she sat up, squinting as she didn\u2019t have her contacts in. She looked around the room, hazy memories of her making out with someone making her heartbeat speed up. The cat, which had hopped off her chest as soon as she sat up only looked back at her in curiosity before her eyes landed on the sleeping figure on the couch across from the single desk in the room. </p><p>There was Min Yoongi, sleeping casually on the couch. She connected two and two, recognizing the cat to be his own, Killmonger. The said cat hopped onto the couch, kneading at the throw blanket on top of the sleeping pianist. Jinhee\u2019s face went red, watching as he woke up. Yoongi woke up slowly, sitting up and looking over at the blushing singer.</p><p>\u201cMm, good morning, Jinhee.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s morning voice sent shivers down Jinhee\u2019s spine, the younger one\u2019s mind already going a million miles a minute. </p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 Did we do something last night? Why am I here? Why didn\u2019t you just leave me at Seokjin\u2019s place?\u201d Jinhee was asking too many questions for her head to be in that much pain and for Yoongi just waking up. Yoongi gave a little chuckle, his hand casually scratching his cat\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened, but you did almost strip in front of me after complaining dresses were too confining, hence my sweater and a pair of shorts a girl left behind some months ago \u2013 don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s washed.\u201d Jinhee felt a twinge of jealousy, only casually gripping at the cuffs of the sweater before releasing her fists. </p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t explain how I got here! I remember making out with someone, was that someone you? Oh my god, did Killmonger watch us?\u201d Jinhee interrogated. This time, it was Yoongi\u2019s turn to tense up. He stopped scratching Killmonger for a little too long, the cat sliding out of his hand. After the flash of anger subsided, Yoongi only chuckled. </p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me. To explain, you slapped the shit out of me because I didn\u2019t let you change the music and Seokjin just told me to bring you home\u2026 Which, by the way, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t let you change the music, although, I don\u2019t think sober you wouldn\u2019t put up as much of a fuss as drunk you did.\u201d His explanation only made Jinhee more embarrassed hearing about her drunk. She looked down, playing with the hem of the sweater.</p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s okay, I guess.\u201d Jinhee\u2019s words barely came out above a whisper, but it was loud enough that Yoongi could hear her. She swung her feet over to grab her (charging, she might add) phone. Her eyes widened at the time, \u201coh fuck, my shift starts in an hour\u2026\u201d She scrambled over to the door, wincing when she put the high heels back on and grabbed her dress from the desk chair. \u201cThank god I live across the street, right?\u201d She laughed a little uncomfortably, Yoongi trailing behind her so he could check her out of the building. He grabbed onto a little gift before they both left his dorm, the both of them going into the elevator and heading down.</p><p>He gave the RA on duty a little nod as she grabbed her ID, his fist clenching a little around the gift for her.</p><p>\u201cJinhee.\u201d Yoongi finally mustered the courage to say her name, the younger one spinning around in curiosity and almost losing her balance. Jinhee tilted her head, watching Yoongi retrieve a little gift bag from his pocket. Inside the clear cellophane bag was some matcha shortbread cookies, haphazardly covered in white chocolate and the bag was tied off with a ribbon wrapping and her name written messily on a card. \u201cI forgot to give this to you yesterday, uh. Happy Valentines day?\u201d </p><p>Jinhee\u2019s heart softened at the bag of cookies, taking it with a smile. \u201cY-Yeah, happy Valentines, Yoongi.\u201d Their hands lingered on each other for just the slightest bit before she raised her other hand to wave goodbye, running across the street to her dorm. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t till she got home and looked at herself in the mirror when she realized she was barefaced, meaning he had wiped off her makeup while she was sleeping. Her mouth curved into a small smile once more, putting on her regular makeup and her glasses before changing into pants. She opted to wear the same sweatshirt (it fits my hair color, she convinced herself), grabbing her backpack with Yoongi\u2019s cookies in it and keys before slipping on her shoes and leaving her dorm. </p><p>\u2014<br></p><p><i>2-14-19</i></p><p><i>happy valentines day everyone :)</i></p>",

(Valentines Day Special Part 2)</b></p><p><b>genre: smut, fluff, angst?<br />word count: 6.8k<br />warnings: swearing, underaged drinking, sex</b></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>YOUR POV</p><p>Although most of you had a cocktail or two during the dinner, the real drinking was about to start now back at Seokjin and Hoseok&rsquo;s apartment. Before you all got to it, though, of course you spent at least 30 minutes taking pictures at the apartment&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;marble tapestry wall&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t every day that the ten of you stunted like that.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, can I have a picture with Jungkook?&rdquo; You asked shyly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re matching.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Yoongi cracked a grin, holding up his camera as you posed hugging Jungkook&rsquo;s waist. The boy stiffened as he felt your body lean against his, cheeks flushing as his stare flickered to your plunging neckline and how close it was to his chest. He cleared his throat, trying to channel the confidence that he usually received when dancing, and slung his arms around your shoulder, the corner of his right lip curving upwards into a smirk. &ldquo;Smile kids.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough pictures,&rdquo; Tae complained taking off his shoes and socks and standing on the couch, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s fucking drink!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone is taking a shot, and I literally mean everyone. That means you too, Jinhee.&rdquo; Hoseok said pulling her up from where she was sitting. The girl shrugged, one shot wouldn&rsquo;t kill her. The ten of you gathered in a circle, shots in one hand and phones in the other. The flashes turned on and you cheered, clinking shot drinks with several of the boys before downing it one gulp. Your face scrunched up in disgust at the burning taste of tequila, waving your hand for some water to chase it down. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s take another.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Slow down there, y/n.&rdquo; Seokjin laughed patting your back, &ldquo;are you trying to get hammered?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a rough week, I&rsquo;m ready to drown in alcohol.&rdquo; You said pouring yourself another shot and taking it without a second thought. Kevin, Jimin, and Jinhee started to scold you, threatening to leave you in your own vomit if you didn&rsquo;t pace yourself.</p><p>Hoseok laughed, &ldquo;Last time you got wasted, you offered to suck my dick, y/n.&rdquo; You apologized defending yourself with<i> sorry, I&rsquo;m a flirty drunk</i> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize, I was gonna let you. Although tonight, it might not be me you&rsquo;re going after.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, oppa?&rdquo; </p><p>Before Hoseok could answer, Yoongi played a song that brought you to your feet. Pulling the body closest in your vicinity up with you, you began swaying to the beat, facing the boy whose blue button up resembled your mini dress. &ldquo;Dance with me Kook, I know you can.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, I wanna take another shot,&rdquo; He said inwardly begging for the alcohol to kick in. You agreed with a smile, entering and leaving the kitchen within minutes before taking hold of Jungkook&rsquo;s hand, using it as a leverage to spin around. By this point all of you were dancing and slowly but surely getting quite intoxicated. You couldn&rsquo;t help but stay close to Jungkook, the image of him getting more attractive as the minutes passed by. The room was beginning to get hazy as the alcohol took over your judgement. </p><p>Jungkook didn&rsquo;t seem to be faring any better against the liquid as his hold on your waist tightened and his gaze intensified. The sparkly innocent doe eyes you were usually met with now a different, dark, and seductive look. His eyes mimicked how you would see them when he performed and you would be lying if you said that they didn&rsquo;t turn you on in the slightest. He leaned closer to you, making you shiver with his breath against your ear, &ldquo;can I tell you something?&rdquo;</p><p>You nod in anticipation, your heart pounding by how close he was, &ldquo;I want to kiss you so bad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>He smirked leaving their makeshift dance floor to go downstairs to the basement, his eyes telling you to follow him after a few minutes - not that any of the boys or Jinhee would notice, they were caught up in their own drunk antics anyway. Seokjin and Hoseok&rsquo;s basement was alright, but there were two other rooms that they converted into more guest bedrooms for when the boys slept over. Going inside the first one, you let out a small &ldquo;oh&rdquo; as you spotted Jungkook sitting at the edge of the bed, legs spread and arms leaning back against the duvet, &ldquo;I was beginning to think you weren&rsquo;t going to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been 5 minutes,&rdquo; you crossed your arms, all your weight resting on one leg. The room screamed Seokjin, the walls a nice millennial shade of pink and the furniture statement pieces. The center point of the whole room was the bed with a crown shaped headboard, directly above it hung a banner that said BT&Sigma;. The boy chuckled and stood, towering over you with his large frame. Slowly, he brought his hand to your chin, tilting your head upwards to meet his lips.</p><p>The kiss was soft and sweet, nothing like the fiery stares and burning touches that he left on your body earlier tonight. He pulled away much too quickly for your liking, letting out a small whine at the loss of contact. Jungkook found it amusing teasing you, the look in his eyes now playful instead of seductive.</p><p>But no, you were not settling with a cute little peck. Almost aggressively, you cupped his cheeks and brought his lips in for another kiss, the force you put against his body enough to make him fall back on the bed. Immediately, you brought your legs to both sides of his lap, straddling him as your arms snaked around his neck. Jungkook&rsquo;s hands instinctively gripped your waist, barely hovering over the top of your ass. Your lips moved almost desperately against each other, tongues fighting and searching over every crevice of each others&rsquo; mouths. Your hands were entangled in his hair, the boy letting out a groan when you tugged on it slightly.</p><p>You felt that hit your core.</p><p>&ldquo;y/n,&rdquo; He breathed out, thrusting up to grind his pelvis against yours. You gasped at the sudden amount of pleasure, your body falling forward against his chest, causing the boy to bite your shoulder in response. This time it was your turn to moan, the sound going straight to his dick. &ldquo;Hold on, I want to make sure you&rsquo;re okay with this. I don&rsquo;t want to make you do anything you don&rsquo;t want to or push you to go farther than you intend to go-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kook, you&rsquo;re incredibly sweet and it honestly means the world to me that you&rsquo;re asking, but I trust you. I know what kind of person you are, and I want nothing more in this moment than for you to fuck me. Don&rsquo;t hold back.&rdquo;</p><p>It was as if a switch went off in Jungkook&rsquo;s head, his gaze looking more predatory than ever. His hands went from your waist to your ass, taking fistfuls of your cheeks and squeezing. Your dress was ridden up to your stomach by now, showing the full view of your black Victoria&rsquo;s Secret thong that you thank god decided to wear. With a smirk, he slipped two fingers under the string, bringing it out far enough so that a light smack resonated the bedroom. &ldquo;As much as I love this dress on you, I think it needs to go, don&rsquo;t you think baby girl?&rdquo;</p><p>Your stomach churned at the pet name he gave you, your hands swiftly crossing across your body to remove your dress before he even had the chance. His eyes shamelessly stared at your bare chest, one hand moving up to knead your breast, his index finger and thumb playing with your nipple. You bit your lip at the stimulation, impatiently trying to rid the boy of his own button up.</p><p>Before you could rip his shirt open, he flipped you over, your back hitting the mattress with a soft thud. He stood up and went to make sure the door was locked, going back to the edge of the bed soon after. His hands went to his shirt buttons, giving you a little strip show before the fabric fell to the floor. Sitting up on your elbows, you watched as he moved on to his pants, slipping off his belt before undoing his pants and zipper, stepping out of his tight black jeans.</p><p>Jungkook rejoined you on the bed, his lips attached to yours as his hands roamed your body. His mouth ghosted over your jawline to your neck, sucking harshly intending to leave several marks. You threw your head back, taking fistfuls of the duvet as one of his hands cupped your core, moving your thong to the side and prodding two fingers at your entrance. It was embarrassing how wet you were, but at that moment, you really couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p><p>His fingers made figure eights on your clit, making you squirm in response. Smiling against your neck, he thrusted his fingers into your pussy, biting at the already abused flesh of your neck as you let out a rather loud moan. You were thankful that the music upstairs was still blasting otherwise the whole apartment would have just heard you.</p><p>You reached for his crotch with one hand, squeezing his member through his boxers. Jungkook let out a <i>fuck</i>, hastily removing the last of both of your undergarments. Your eyes bulged at his dick, although not the biggest you&rsquo;ve ever seen, it was definitely on the girthy side. Impatiently, he went to the drawer and pulled out a condom, rolling it onto his length before lining it up with your entrance. You put your hand on his chest, motioning for him to stop, &ldquo;wait. Jungkook, I want to suck your dick-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck as much as I would love for you to do that, y/n, I need to be inside you right now. We&rsquo;ll do that next time,&rdquo; He said moving his tip up and down your slit, making sure it was well-lubricated enough to slide in. You gasped as his dick slowly entered you, feeling the burning stretch almost immediately. As soon as he was buried to the hilt, you clenched your pussy making him moan. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so fucking tight baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook<i> please</i> move,&rdquo; you whined thrusting your hips up. The boy grabbed your arms, pinning them against the mattress as he started to thrust at a leisurely pace. &ldquo;Jungkook.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to go faster baby girl?&rdquo; He asked with a smirk, staring down at you authoritatively. You nodded, now that you were used to his length, you needed him to just wreck you.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Daddy please</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>With the magic word, he rested his forehead against yours, keeping eye contact with you as his pace rapidly quickened. Anyone who said sex intoxicated is a bad idea, has clearly never had sex with Jeon Jungkook. Every time he thrusted back in, his tip lightly grazed over your g spot, your stomach tightening in record time.</p><p>You clenched your stomach as your high approached, the sudden tightness making Jungkook drill into you even faster, chasing his own climax. You moaned into his shoulder as you came, the boy muffling curses against your neck as he released into the condom. He rested on top of you, keeping his length in you for a few moments more before he had to pull out.</p><p>You were feeling a little bit more sober now, your body still laying down. Jungkook stood and removed the condom, throwing it away in the trash bin before finding some tissues and wiping his length of any cum. Taking an additional few tissues, he returned to where you laid and started wiping your core clean, your body wincing from sensitivity. He apologized with a sweet smile, tossing the tissues before coming back to join you on the bed.</p><p>The sweet doe-eyed boy was back, even with how incredibly sinful he looked naked. Jungkook stared at you as you sat up, admiring how breathtaking you looked post-sex. You chuckled and moved closer, hugging his waist, &ldquo;do you think they&rsquo;re looking for us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; He shrugged wrapping his arms around your body. &ldquo;We should probably go back.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and pressed a soft kiss on his cheek, &ldquo;Yeah, we should, daddy.&rdquo;</p><p>He scoffed as you searched for your dress and thong, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that unless you want a round two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who says I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yooooongi.&rdquo; Jinhee laid down dramatically from her seated position on the couch, her head hitting Yoongi&rsquo;s thighs. Yoongi&rsquo;s slowly sobering attention went to the silver haired girl, looking down and tilting his head when she drawled out his name. &ldquo;Why the hell are you playing so much rap? It&rsquo;s thotty hours, we should be playing some fuckin&rsquo;&hellip; Trap or some shit. Give me the fucking phone.&rdquo; Her hands reached out for the phone in Yoongi&rsquo;s hand, the phone only lifting slightly so that it was out of her reach. His phone was the only one connected to the house&rsquo;s speaker, and he was confused as to why she suddenly had a problem with the music. </p><p>Jinhee whined, sitting back up and reaching for his phone once more. Once she was basically on his lap, she finally got a hold of his phone, trying to unlock it. Yoongi sighed, holding his hand out. </p><p>&ldquo;Jinhee, my lineage are the only people who can unlock it, give me back my phone.&rdquo; Yoongi managed to muster at least a little bit of authority in his voice, grabbing for his phone from the younger one. Jinhee only kept swerving, getting up and stumbling around to avoid Yoongi grabbing for his phone. He only followed after her slowly, watching her stumble around. </p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck? Why won&rsquo;t it unlock?! I won&rsquo;t until we play fucking something else! Alexa, play<i> Reel It In</i> by Amine!&rdquo; Jinhee managed to yell that over the music, frowning when she didn&rsquo;t get a response back. Yoongi furrowed his brows. Seokjin and Hoseok didn&rsquo;t have an Alexa in the first place, so where did Jinhee get that idea? </p><p>&ldquo;Jinhee, maybe you need to drink some water&hellip;&ldquo; Yoongi started, swiping his phone from her. He tucked his phone away and reached towards Jinhee. She squinted, pushing the general direction of Yoongi&rsquo;s hands away. </p><p>&ldquo;Bitch, why the fuck are you trying to touch me? Weird ass creep!&rdquo; A hand flew in the air, and a crisp smack resonated through the room.</p><p>If Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t completely sober before then, he clearly was now. He stood there in shock, trying to process what was happening, but everything after that felt like it was happening in slow motion. Jinhee attempted to jump on him to hit him more, but she was held back by Jimin, who was oddly concerned about her. </p><p>&ldquo;Woah woah calm down Jinhee! You know what? You need to calm down, let&rsquo;s go to Jin hyung&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; Jimin said softly, spinning her around and leading her to Seokjin&rsquo;s room. His hand settled on the small of her back, making Yoongi shift uncomfortably.</p><p>He sat back down on the couch, sighing slowly in defeat. Namjoon came over a few beats later with a bag of frozen pineapple from the freezer, gently pressing it to the reddening skin of Yoongi&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;Hyung, are you good?&rdquo; Namjoon took Yoongi&rsquo;s phone, changing the music but to something calmer. The party that the 10 of them were hosting had been dying down for a little now, since you, Jungkook, Jimin, and Jinhee were missing from the main scene. Yoongi only frowned, shaking his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve met a violent drunk&hellip;&rdquo; Yoongi laughs a little, throwing his head back. </p><p>&ldquo;You know what, I didn&rsquo;t expect that from her.&rdquo; Seokjin laughed, settling on Yoongi&rsquo;s other side. Yoongi held the frozen pineapple, letting Namjoon&rsquo;s hand rest. Seokjin was only slightly tipsy and Namjoon, after hitting the wall, decided he was done with alcohol for the night, so he was also sobering up with the two seniors. </p><p>&ldquo;I feel really bad though&hellip;&rdquo; Yoongi frowned, leaning forward so that his elbows rested on his thighs. He set down the bag of frozen pineapple, burying his face into his hands. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want her hating me for anything, it&rsquo;s just hard forming words around her and her and Jimin kinda make me upset, is that weird? I&rsquo;ve been floored by her voice for like. Months now. I caught her singing late in the practice rooms one night while I was figuring out my rep for my last recital and I just fell in love with her voice&mdash; and to now put a face to that voice? Jinhee&rsquo;s an angel and I feel bad for making her mad&hellip;&rdquo; Yoongi sighed, massaging his temples. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time Seokjin had heard Yoongi talk about his best friend like this, but hearing it sober for the first time was almost unbearable. </p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi, I love you, but you need to apologize to her. And maybe confess to her. Maybe dick her down.&rdquo; Seokjin patted Yoongi gently, the younger one&rsquo;s face going red.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting to that second one! I don&rsquo;t know about that last one!&rdquo; He exclaimed, a smile cracking on Seokjin&rsquo;s face. Yoongi stood up, hyping himself up to go into the room.</p><p>In the room, however, Jinhee was still as heated as she was before, pacing back and forth in Seokjin&rsquo;s room. Jimin watched her pace and babble from Seokjin&rsquo;s gaming chair, casually biting his lower lip while he eyed the singer. </p><p>&ldquo;Why the fuck was he being so mean to me? He fucking started it. He wouldn&rsquo;t let me fucking change the song?? It literally takes like 2 seconds to unlock his fucking phone. I fucking hate him? And don&rsquo;t get me fucking started on how much I want to kiss him! Have you seen his hands? I don&rsquo;t even know if I want them on my neck choking me hard enough that I have to learn how to do actual makeup to match my neck or if I just want to hold them!&rdquo; She exhaled loudly, stopping in front of Seokjin&rsquo;s bedside table. She eyed the picture of Seokjin and Yoongi from their reveal for Beta Tau their freshman year, picking the frame up. </p><p>She made the motion to throw it down, but right when she was about to drop it, a hand wrapped around her wrist, spinning her around so that she was face to face with Jimin. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so reckless sometimes, you know that, Jinhee darling?&rdquo; His hands pried the framed picture away from her hands, setting the frame back down on the bedside table, only face down so that it wouldn&rsquo;t crack. &ldquo;I promised the hyungs I&rsquo;d calm you down, so why don&rsquo;t you sit down? I know the perfect way to calm you down.&rdquo; His eyes glinted with a little bit of mischief, pushing her gently onto the bed. Once she was sitting, he pushed her slightly, letting her move so that she was backing up and sitting with her back leaning on the sea of pillows propped up on the bed frame. He crawled over Jinhee, making her blush and look away. </p><p>Jimin only chuckled, using one of his fingers to trace her jawline before tilting her head gently so that they were making eye contact again while the other kept him steady holding the bed frame. &ldquo;Trust me, I know exactly what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; He leaned in close, hearing Jinhee suck in a breath. Another chuckle. </p><p>Jimin began to pepper small kisses along Jinhee&rsquo;s jawline and down her neck, stopping occasionally on her neck to bite down, but not enough to make a mark. A small moan escaped her lips, her body becoming like putty in his arms as she tilted her head back so that he could have more room. He pulled away, cupping her cheeks. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you trust me?&rdquo; Jimin carefully asked. His lips ghosted over hers, causing Jinhee to nod eagerly, her eyes matching his with full blown lust. Jinhee closed the gap between them almost desperately, sighing in bliss when he began kissing back, her arms wrapping around his waist. </p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s hands moved sensually against her body, his fingertips already playing with the edge of her dress. Lifting it up, his hands lightly moved up and down the outside of her thighs before moving inside to spread her legs apart. &ldquo;Jimin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to help you relax, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>He kissed her once more, expertly moving his lips as his hand stayed on Jinhee&rsquo;s inner thigh. She sighed in content as the older boy finally pressed his fingers against the cloth of her underwear, &ldquo;I can feel how wet you are, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>She blushed at his comment, turning her head away to the side. He only grinned, moving downwards so that he was face to face with her core. Jimin looped his fingers around the sides of her panties, licking his lips in anticipation.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Jinhee?&rdquo; The door opened suddenly, Yoongi standing at the doorway with Seokjin. </p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo; Seokjin said shocked at the sight of his brother about to eat out his best friend. Jinhee sat up abruptly quick, her face burning. </p><p>&ldquo;I need to. Bathroom. Attempt to die by eating Seokjin&rsquo;s lemon soaps.&rdquo; She muttered quickly, speeding through into the private bathroom. Once the door closed, Yoongi stomped up to Jimin, grabbing him by the collar. </p><p>&ldquo;You. Absolute. Fuck.&rdquo; Yoongi growled, Seokjin stood next to Yoongi, hoping he wouldn&rsquo;t beat his brother up. &ldquo;What the fuck were you trying to do with her?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was trying to make her relax, hyung. Isn&rsquo;t that what I promised?&rdquo; Jimin said quite casually. Yoongi paused for a minute, letting go of his collar. Jinhee peeked her head out of the bathroom, slowly trying to sneak out incognito. She managed to slip past the three, praying constantly that the floors wouldn&rsquo;t creak. She successfully snuck out, relaxing and going over to the couch where Namjoon sat, scrolling through his phone. Kevin, Taehyung, and Hoseok were engrossed in a game of Cards Against Humanity on the floor, so Jinhee sat next to Namjoon. She sighed, taking the plush that rested on the couch and mashing its face in. &ldquo;Hookup culture is fucking weird, Joon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me. Have you seen y/n and Jungkook? I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;re partaking in said culture.&rdquo; Namjoon counted heads, clicking his tongue.</p><p>Back in Seokjin&rsquo;s room, Jimin, Seokjin, and Yoongi were still in the same predicament, Yoongi&rsquo;s arms crossed as he towered over Jimin.</p><p>&ldquo;Park Jimin. You know she was intoxicated. So why did you still try taking advantage of her?&rdquo; Yoongi sighed, mussing up his own hair. The younger one shrugged, smirking a little at Yoongi.</p><p>&ldquo;She was extremely willing to let me use my ways to calm her down. Why are you so mad, hm? Not like you like her or anything, right?&rdquo; Jimin asked rhetorically, before seeing the change in Yoongi&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Oh? Did I strike a chord?&rdquo; Jimin asked innocently, smiling lazily at Yoongi.</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin, you&rsquo;re drunk. Apologize to him,&rdquo; Seokjin said firmly, holding back Yoongi from doing anything irrational. Jimin shrugged again, leaning back on his propped arms. </p><p>&ldquo;You know what? It&rsquo;s whatever, I&rsquo;m just gonna take her home and apologize in the morning.&rdquo; Yoongi left the room, not wanting to deal with his brother anymore. </p><p>Yoongi walked back into the living room, where Jungkook and you were finally back up in, looking a little presentable in comparison to what you two were just doing. You two had joined the three playing the card game on the floor, Namjoon and Jinhee watching a video on Namjoon&rsquo;s phone. The party had died down considerably, making Yoongi sigh. It was still a weekday so he justified his next move, walking up to Jinhee who only eyed him and crossed her arms. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to take you back to your dorm, Seokjin said you had a shift tomorrow.&rdquo; Yoongi started off carefully. Jinhee didn&rsquo;t seem to object, instead, she sat up from resting on Namjoon&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Already? Jinnie&rsquo;s no fun.&rdquo; She sighed, easily complying with Yoongi. Taehyung and Kevin also looked up, seeing the two getting ready to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, are you two leaving already? Can we tag along?&rdquo; Taehyung piped up. Yoongi nodded, motioning them to get ready as well. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m just gonna drop Jinhee off and&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, shit. I forgot my keys at my dorm and my roommate&rsquo;s out on a fucking date.&rdquo; Jinhee groaned, throwing her head back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just sleep in like the lounge or something&hellip;&rdquo; She huffed, but Yoongi&rsquo;s fist tightened. </p><p>&ldquo;You can sleep in my dorm, it&rsquo;s a single.&rdquo; Yoongi waved goodbye to everyone, Jinhee&rsquo;s arm around his shoulder and Kevin and Taehyung trailing behind, suspiciously holding hands with each other. </p><p>&mdash;<br /></p><p>Once Yoongi checked Jinhee in and bid goodnight to Kevin and Taehyung, the two younger brothers went back to Taehyung&rsquo;s room, considering that Kevin&rsquo;s roommates were back and he didn&rsquo;t want to deal with them just yet. Considering they weren&rsquo;t as drunk as before, Taehyung felt completely confident in confiding in someone else that wasn&rsquo;t just his soulmate.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Kevin?&rdquo; Taehyung asked absentmindedly, locking the door behind him. Yeontan saw the two come in and came running over to greet the new guest, Kevin smiling softly when he saw the little ball of fluff hop on his leg. Kevin crouched down, picking up the pomeranian, scratching his chin. &ldquo;I have a question&hellip;&rdquo; Taehyung bit his lip. The two sat down on the floor in their room, Yeontan running around the two of them. Kevin tilted his head, curious as to what Taehyung had to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Shoot.&rdquo; Kevin&rsquo;s smile sent a little flutter to Taehyung&rsquo;s stomach. The older&rsquo;s hands were clasped, trying to calm down. </p><p>&ldquo;Earlier on the dance floor&hellip; You whispered in my ear and you told me that you really liked me, is that true?&rdquo; Taehyung stared at his hands. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it and maybe I don&rsquo;t just like girls? I often imagine myself maybe getting with people like you and not just for sex like. I just wanna give you the world sometimes and the fact that you wore real Gucci, and not even that knockoff sh&mdash;&ldquo; Taehyung&rsquo;s words were cut off by a kiss, his eyes widening. Kevin didn&rsquo;t feel the kiss being reciprocated, so he began to pull back. Almost frantically, Taehyung pulled him back in for another kiss, sighing in relief. </p><p>They continued to make out for a little, not going any further due to the awkward position of their knees bumping each other from the both of them sitting cross legged and the sheer fatigue both of them were feeling. They both managed to get up and make it onto Taehyung&rsquo;s bed, soft whispers of &ldquo;i really like you&rdquo; and replies of &ldquo;me too, love&rdquo;. </p><p>&mdash;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s time for me to take the kids back.&rdquo; Namjoon stood next to Seokjin, the two of them watching Jimin fuss about the mess in the apartment. Jimin&rsquo;s punishment, given to him by Seokjin and Hoseok, was to clean up the apartment, which was a mess to say the least. You and Jungkook were sitting on the couch now, holding each other&rsquo;s hands and half asleep. Seokjin nodded, patting Namjoon on the back. </p><p>&ldquo;Have a safe trip back up to north campus, alright?&rdquo; Namjoon only nodded, walking over to you and Jungkook and smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey you two, time to go back up to your dorm.&rdquo; Namjoon stifled a yawn. You and Jungkook nodded, the both of you getting off the couch. Jimin noticed your figures moving, a pout on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah~ My baby y/n is leaving? Have a safe trip back!&rdquo; Jimin said cheerfully, although him throwing the cups into the trash bag conveyed that he was just very sad to see you go. You giggled, giving him a tight hug before joining Jungkook and Namjoon at the door. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll text you when I get back to my dorm to let you know I didn&rsquo;t die the two blocks back to north campus!&rdquo; You yelled, grabbing Jungkook&rsquo;s hand as he balanced you while you slipped your shoes on. The three of you waved to those left in the apartment, starting the walk home. The whole time, you and Jungkook walked ahead of Namjoon, the older one bidding you two a goodnight as soon as you two got back to your dorm. Jungkook scanned his ID at the front of the gate to your dorm, the two of you managing to get back up to the elevators. You didn&rsquo;t realize that you two lived on the same floor till then, and you only realized it when you both got off at the same floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to wake up for our 8 am~&rdquo; Jungkook teased you, adding a cute ending syllable to your name. You blushed a little, giggling before you snuck one last kiss before running into your room. Once the door shut, your grin never fell off your face till you fell asleep, and Jungkook would also have to say the same.</p><p>&mdash;<br /></p><p>Your alarm sounded at 6:30 am, you groaned squinting at the tiny screen of your phone. Fuck, you had class. You got ready for class half-awake, putting the least amount of effort possible to look presentable to go out. Your mind didn&rsquo;t register the events from last night until you saw Jungkook walk into class, wearing grey sweats and a white shirt (no surprise there) and making a simple outfit look so fucking good. You, on the other hand, suddenly felt self conscious about your pink hoodie, black leggings, and messy bun. Nonetheless, you waved brightly as you made eye contact with him. Jungkook waved awkwardly, sitting in the front row instead of his usual spot in the back next to you. Your cheeks burned in embarrassment, staring into the back of his head as you wondered why he was acting so weird. He didn&rsquo;t even respond to the meme you texted him during class, and he always responded to memes.</p><p>Warily, you approached him as class ended, Jungkook had a habit of packing up slowly. &ldquo;Hey, did I do something wrong? You&rsquo;re acting really weird.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked up at you, his eyes widening like a deer in headlights, &ldquo;N-no, you did nothing wrong! Sorry, I just uh&hellip;I gotta go, y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>You frowned as he left the classroom, panic suddenly filling your insides at the events from last night. You cradled your head in your hands, your breath getting shorter as you stressed out. Immediately, you rushed back to your dorm, not having the willpower to go to your next class. After dropping your backpack in your dorm room, you pulled your phone and some headphones out, dialing your Big on FaceTime.</p><p>&ldquo;My Little,&rdquo; she smiled upon answering, &ldquo;I was meaning to call you last night and tell you that you looked so hot, but I fell asleep and forgot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unnie.&rdquo;</p><p>Tears pooled in your eyes, your voice breaking as you called out her name. Her face broke out in worry, questioning you endlessly as you began to cry. As soon as you regained your breath, you spilled everything about last night and this morning to her, &ldquo;-I just don&rsquo;t know if he like regrets having sex with me? Or if he just became friends with me so that we could fuck and now that we have he doesn&rsquo;t wanna be friends anymore?? Like Jieun unnie, I don&rsquo;t know what&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop, now that sounds ridiculous. Jungkook wouldn&rsquo;t do that to you, especially since you&rsquo;re Jimin&rsquo;s potential little sis. It would ruin their brotherhood if he played you like that,&rdquo; Jieun said reasonably, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably just dealing with his own shit, y/n. I don&rsquo;t think you should take it personally.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what if-&rdquo;</p><p>The lounge door slowly opened, the same brown-haired doe-eyed boy that you were ranting about behind the door. He called your name softly, asking if you wanted to talk back in his room. You told your Big you would call her later, furiously wiping away at your tears as you followed him the couple rooms down to his single. You sat down on his bean bag chair as he went to his bed, the atmosphere awkward as he stared at you sniffling across from him.</p><p>&ldquo;y/n-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was I bad yesterday? Like was I just a really bad fuck?&rdquo; You blurted, eyes puffy from crying.</p><p>He shook his head, both hands mirroring the movement as he continuously denied your statement, &ldquo;No y/n, you were, wow, amazing. It was honestly the best I&rsquo;ve had. I just&hellip;like&hellip;isn&rsquo;t drunk sex nonconsensual??&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to feel like I took advantage of you or something, especially since you&rsquo;re basically Jimin hyung&rsquo;s little. And I made you cry too, like-&rdquo; He stopped as you started giggling, confused at your change of emotion.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, I wanted everything that we did yesterday. I don&rsquo;t regret any single part of it.&rdquo; You said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s cute that you would worry about this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you absolutely sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I mean, we did agree on a round two, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; You said with a little smirk, wiping away any leftover tears from your face.</p><p>He chuckled, scratching the back of his neck, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for making you cry. Trust me, that was the last thing I ever wanted to do.&rdquo;</p><p>You crossed your arms, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I thought you hated me or maybe you thought I was ugly, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate you, y/n, and you are nowhere near ugly.&rdquo; He said grabbing your hands to pull you up for a hug. You wrapped your arms around his waist, your body suddenly hyperaware of his abdomen pressing against you. He relaxed, resting his chin on top of your head. &ldquo;So, daddy kink, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>You shoved him away while laughing, but he caught the blush on your cheeks. You told him to shut up, threatening to tell the boys about what happened.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d be in more trouble than me, y/n.&rdquo; He chuckled, &ldquo;besides, I think they already know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They do? Jimin oppa<i> knows</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were all pretty drunk last night, y/n. Apparently even Jinhee noona slapped Yoongi hyung.&rdquo; He said, your mouth making an O shape at the new piece of information. The both of you casually sat down on his bed, suddenly not knowing what to say. </p><p>&ldquo;So, uh, what do you wanna do about last night?&rdquo; He asked, fingers playing with the ends of his shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you said carefully, &ldquo;what can we do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can either pretend it never happened, say it was a one time thing, or I don&rsquo;t know, maybe we can make a deal.&rdquo; He said, his voice trailing at the end.</p><p>You raised your eyebrow, &ldquo;What kind of deal? Like, be fuck buddies?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, yeah.&rdquo; He said, a flash of confidence in his tone, &ldquo;College and Greek life is stressful, and having someone to relieve stress with - that isn&rsquo;t a stranger - could be beneficial. For the both of us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fuck around with many guys, Jeon. Even though drunk me may act differently.&rdquo; You said seriously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a sweet friend, but I know your previous sex stories and I&rsquo;m not the kind of girl who waits to be someone&rsquo;s safe backup when they get rejected by someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swear y/n, if you agree to this, you&rsquo;ll be the only girl I&rsquo;ll be with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. But if I see you hook up with someone else at a party, I&rsquo;ll beat you up before Jimin oppa can.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled, completely hooked by your feistiness. &ldquo;Deal, baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;<br /></p><p>The first thing Jinhee felt when she woke up was the head splitting headache. She groaned, the feeling of death washing over her senses.</p><p>Right&hellip; That&rsquo;s why she didn&rsquo;t drink. The pounding in her ears seemed to almost be unbearable, but the warmth on top of her head helped aid the headache.</p><p>Wait&mdash; Why was there something warm on her head?</p><p>Jinhee mentally prepared herself for the light, opening her eyes to see a pair of green cat eyes looking back at her curiously. Immediately, instead of freaking out, she only tensed for a split moment before reaching up to the cat on her chest, her hand in a loosely covered fist. The grey cat saw the movement, only registering it for a few seconds before it began to nuzzle into her hand. Jinhee softened, scratching the cheek of the cat. It was only then that Jinhee saw the sleeves of the dark green sweater she was wearing. Last she remembered, she never owned a dark green champion crewneck. Immediately, she sat up, squinting as she didn&rsquo;t have her contacts in. She looked around the room, hazy memories of her making out with someone making her heartbeat speed up. The cat, which had hopped off her chest as soon as she sat up only looked back at her in curiosity before her eyes landed on the sleeping figure on the couch across from the single desk in the room. </p><p>There was Min Yoongi, sleeping casually on the couch. She connected two and two, recognizing the cat to be his own, Killmonger. The said cat hopped onto the couch, kneading at the throw blanket on top of the sleeping pianist. Jinhee&rsquo;s face went red, watching as he woke up. Yoongi woke up slowly, sitting up and looking over at the blushing singer.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm, good morning, Jinhee.&rdquo; Yoongi&rsquo;s morning voice sent shivers down Jinhee&rsquo;s spine, the younger one&rsquo;s mind already going a million miles a minute. </p><p>&ldquo;Did&hellip; Did we do something last night? Why am I here? Why didn&rsquo;t you just leave me at Seokjin&rsquo;s place?&rdquo; Jinhee was asking too many questions for her head to be in that much pain and for Yoongi just waking up. Yoongi gave a little chuckle, his hand casually scratching his cat&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing happened, but you did almost strip in front of me after complaining dresses were too confining, hence my sweater and a pair of shorts a girl left behind some months ago &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s washed.&rdquo; Jinhee felt a twinge of jealousy, only casually gripping at the cuffs of the sweater before releasing her fists. </p><p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t explain how I got here! I remember making out with someone, was that someone you? Oh my god, did Killmonger watch us?&rdquo; Jinhee interrogated. This time, it was Yoongi&rsquo;s turn to tense up. He stopped scratching Killmonger for a little too long, the cat sliding out of his hand. After the flash of anger subsided, Yoongi only chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t me. To explain, you slapped the shit out of me because I didn&rsquo;t let you change the music and Seokjin just told me to bring you home&hellip; Which, by the way, I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t let you change the music, although, I don&rsquo;t think sober you wouldn&rsquo;t put up as much of a fuss as drunk you did.&rdquo; His explanation only made Jinhee more embarrassed hearing about her drunk. She looked down, playing with the hem of the sweater.</p><p>&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s okay, I guess.&rdquo; Jinhee&rsquo;s words barely came out above a whisper, but it was loud enough that Yoongi could hear her. She swung her feet over to grab her (charging, she might add) phone. Her eyes widened at the time, &ldquo;oh fuck, my shift starts in an hour&hellip;&rdquo; She scrambled over to the door, wincing when she put the high heels back on and grabbed her dress from the desk chair. &ldquo;Thank god I live across the street, right?&rdquo; She laughed a little uncomfortably, Yoongi trailing behind her so he could check her out of the building. He grabbed onto a little gift before they both left his dorm, the both of them going into the elevator and heading down.</p><p>He gave the RA on duty a little nod as she grabbed her ID, his fist clenching a little around the gift for her.</p><p>&ldquo;Jinhee.&rdquo; Yoongi finally mustered the courage to say her name, the younger one spinning around in curiosity and almost losing her balance. Jinhee tilted her head, watching Yoongi retrieve a little gift bag from his pocket. Inside the clear cellophane bag was some matcha shortbread cookies, haphazardly covered in white chocolate and the bag was tied off with a ribbon wrapping and her name written messily on a card. &ldquo;I forgot to give this to you yesterday, uh. Happy Valentines day?&rdquo; </p><p>Jinhee&rsquo;s heart softened at the bag of cookies, taking it with a smile. &ldquo;Y-Yeah, happy Valentines, Yoongi.&rdquo; Their hands lingered on each other for just the slightest bit before she raised her other hand to wave goodbye, running across the street to her dorm. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t till she got home and looked at herself in the mirror when she realized she was barefaced, meaning he had wiped off her makeup while she was sleeping. Her mouth curved into a small smile once more, putting on her regular makeup and her glasses before changing into pants. She opted to wear the same sweatshirt (it fits my hair color, she convinced herself), grabbing her backpack with Yoongi&rsquo;s cookies in it and keys before slipping on her shoes and leaving her dorm. </p><p>&mdash;<br /></p><p><i>2-14-19</i></p><p><i>happy valentines day everyone :)</i></p>",

(Valentines Day Special Part 2)</b></p>\n<p><b>genre: smut, fluff, angst?<br />word count: 6.8k<br />warnings: swearing, underaged drinking, sex</b></p>\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>\n<p>YOUR POV</p>\n<p>Although most of you had a cocktail or two during the dinner, the real drinking was about to start now back at Seokjin and Hoseok&rsquo;s apartment. Before you all got to it, though, of course you spent at least 30 minutes taking pictures at the apartment&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;marble tapestry wall&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t every day that the ten of you stunted like that.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Wait, can I have a picture with Jungkook?&rdquo; You asked shyly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re matching.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Yoongi cracked a grin, holding up his camera as you posed hugging Jungkook&rsquo;s waist. The boy stiffened as he felt your body lean against his, cheeks flushing as his stare flickered to your plunging neckline and how close it was to his chest. He cleared his throat, trying to channel the confidence that he usually received when dancing, and slung his arms around your shoulder, the corner of his right lip curving upwards into a smirk. &ldquo;Smile kids.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Enough pictures,&rdquo; Tae complained taking off his shoes and socks and standing on the couch, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s fucking drink!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone is taking a shot, and I literally mean everyone. That means you too, Jinhee.&rdquo; Hoseok said pulling her up from where she was sitting. The girl shrugged, one shot wouldn&rsquo;t kill her. The ten of you gathered in a circle, shots in one hand and phones in the other. The flashes turned on and you cheered, clinking shot drinks with several of the boys before downing it one gulp. Your face scrunched up in disgust at the burning taste of tequila, waving your hand for some water to chase it down. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s take another.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Slow down there, y/n.&rdquo; Seokjin laughed patting your back, &ldquo;are you trying to get hammered?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a rough week, I&rsquo;m ready to drown in alcohol.&rdquo; You said pouring yourself another shot and taking it without a second thought. Kevin, Jimin, and Jinhee started to scold you, threatening to leave you in your own vomit if you didn&rsquo;t pace yourself.</p>\n<p>Hoseok laughed, &ldquo;Last time you got wasted, you offered to suck my dick, y/n.&rdquo; You apologized defending yourself with<i> sorry, I&rsquo;m a flirty drunk</i> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize, I was gonna let you. Although tonight, it might not be me you&rsquo;re going after.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, oppa?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Before Hoseok could answer, Yoongi played a song that brought you to your feet. Pulling the body closest in your vicinity up with you, you began swaying to the beat, facing the boy whose blue button up resembled your mini dress. &ldquo;Dance with me Kook, I know you can.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Wait, I wanna take another shot,&rdquo; He said inwardly begging for the alcohol to kick in. You agreed with a smile, entering and leaving the kitchen within minutes before taking hold of Jungkook&rsquo;s hand, using it as a leverage to spin around. By this point all of you were dancing and slowly but surely getting quite intoxicated. You couldn&rsquo;t help but stay close to Jungkook, the image of him getting more attractive as the minutes passed by. The room was beginning to get hazy as the alcohol took over your judgement. </p>\n<p>Jungkook didn&rsquo;t seem to be faring any better against the liquid as his hold on your waist tightened and his gaze intensified. The sparkly innocent doe eyes you were usually met with now a different, dark, and seductive look. His eyes mimicked how you would see them when he performed and you would be lying if you said that they didn&rsquo;t turn you on in the slightest. He leaned closer to you, making you shiver with his breath against your ear, &ldquo;can I tell you something?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You nod in anticipation, your heart pounding by how close he was, &ldquo;I want to kiss you so bad.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He smirked leaving their makeshift dance floor to go downstairs to the basement, his eyes telling you to follow him after a few minutes - not that any of the boys or Jinhee would notice, they were caught up in their own drunk antics anyway. Seokjin and Hoseok&rsquo;s basement was alright, but there were two other rooms that they converted into more guest bedrooms for when the boys slept over. Going inside the first one, you let out a small &ldquo;oh&rdquo; as you spotted Jungkook sitting at the edge of the bed, legs spread and arms leaning back against the duvet, &ldquo;I was beginning to think you weren&rsquo;t going to come.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been 5 minutes,&rdquo; you crossed your arms, all your weight resting on one leg. The room screamed Seokjin, the walls a nice millennial shade of pink and the furniture statement pieces. The center point of the whole room was the bed with a crown shaped headboard, directly above it hung a banner that said BT&Sigma;. The boy chuckled and stood, towering over you with his large frame. Slowly, he brought his hand to your chin, tilting your head upwards to meet his lips.</p>\n<p>The kiss was soft and sweet, nothing like the fiery stares and burning touches that he left on your body earlier tonight. He pulled away much too quickly for your liking, letting out a small whine at the loss of contact. Jungkook found it amusing teasing you, the look in his eyes now playful instead of seductive.</p>\n<p>But no, you were not settling with a cute little peck. Almost aggressively, you cupped his cheeks and brought his lips in for another kiss, the force you put against his body enough to make him fall back on the bed. Immediately, you brought your legs to both sides of his lap, straddling him as your arms snaked around his neck. Jungkook&rsquo;s hands instinctively gripped your waist, barely hovering over the top of your ass. Your lips moved almost desperately against each other, tongues fighting and searching over every crevice of each others&rsquo; mouths. Your hands were entangled in his hair, the boy letting out a groan when you tugged on it slightly.</p>\n</p>",
