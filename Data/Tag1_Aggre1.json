Primarily MLP of all generations, but also with some Pokemon, Classic Spyro and Minecraft mixed in. <br>I also like a lot of other things, although I can't promise consistent content for such. I am an artist and will attempt to upload fanart to this blog as well as photos of found merch of interest and my ponies. <br><br><br>This blog will never upload or reblog porn, content that is otherwise sexual, or gore. However reblogs may contain the odd swear word or so, and though I do my best, I cannot always vouch for those I reblog from. I'd say this blog is more PG than G. :p\n<br>Following this theme,<b> I do not consent to interaction from NSFW/Kink/ddlg/cgl blogs.</b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br><br><br><br><br>For your searching and blocking convince, all fandom content will be tagged with the names of relating media and characters.\nAnything that falls outside of fandom stuff will be tagged \"Not Fandom\". Pony-esque things that aren't necessarily MLP will be tagged \"Not A Real Pony\" and/or \"Fakie\" when applicable. I also like real horses. Those are tagged \"Real Horses.\"\n<br><br>If you decide to follow me and require any tags please let me know! It's not a problem at all and I will do it for you. c:\n<br><br>Tags for my content are currently \"ArtByTheFanBlob\" and \"TheFanBlobTakesPics\"! :)<font?",
