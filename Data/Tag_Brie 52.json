She never failed to surprise me. &ldquo;I can dance!&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I never said you couldn&rsquo;t,&ldquo; she said, her attention on a guest list. &quot;It&rsquo;s supposed to be fun, Y/N. I booked it for Isaac and I, you and Brie, my sister, Naomi, Kieran and their partners. What&rsquo;s wrong with some dance lessons to help you out when it comes to the wedding reception?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;The dance lessons bit,&ldquo; I pointed out. &quot;And the bit where Naomi and Kieran are there. Oh, yeah, and the bit where it&rsquo;s happening later on this afternoon. And again tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;All in time for the wedding at the end of the week,&ldquo; she said, finally meeting me eyes with a knowing look. &quot;Quit complaining. You&rsquo;ll love it. You should go tell Brie. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll love it, too!&rdquo; </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Do we get a choice?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Not really, now shoo, you&rsquo;re distracting me,&ldquo; she said, shoving me gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed and left her to her own devices, deciding to go find Brie. It was still early in the morning, so she&rsquo;d be at the hotel&rsquo;s gym doing her workout. I didn&rsquo;t know much, just that it was part of her nine month training to help prepare her for the part of Captain Marvel. She&rsquo;d promised her personal trainer she&rsquo;d keep up with it, so she&rsquo;d been going once every day since we got here a few days ago. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I headed to the gym, having to ask three different people for directions because I&rsquo;d never been there and hadn&rsquo;t really planned on it. I didn&rsquo;t even know the hotel <i>had </i>a gym until Brie asked when we first checked in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I got there, the gym had like eight people in it, as expected. I mean, who exercises on holiday? I saw Brie by the weights, a man next to her spot checking as she lifted the heavy bar. I approached them and tried not to choke on my own spit when I saw her lifting the weight with ease. How hadn&rsquo;t I noticed how strong she was before? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Is that Y/N?&rdquo; Brie asked, her eyes not leaving her spot on the ceiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yeah,&ldquo; I managed to get out, distracted by her muscles. I tried not to ogle, but she was wearing a sleeveless shirt and her muscles were literally rippling under the pressure of the weights. Now that I paid attention, I realised how fit she was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Okay, I&rsquo;m stopping now,&rdquo; Brie said, having help from the tall guy to put the bar on the stand. She sat up and smiled at the man. &ldquo;Thanks, Jack.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack saluted and left the two of us, giving me a friendly smile as he walked past. Brie breathed out and grabbed her water bottle, taking serval gulps before looking to me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Everything okay?&ldquo; she asked, grabbing her sweat towel and wiping her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Okay, was Brie always this hot or what? Did I miss something? Pretending to be girlfriend was clouding my judgement. She was my <i>friend</i>. I was being weird, right?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook it off and cleared my throat. &quot;Yeah, everything&rsquo;s cool. How&rsquo;s your workout going?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awesome. Not as good without my trainer, but Jack is one of the trainers here at the hotel and he&rsquo;s been helping me out a little. Gotta stay on track if I&rsquo;m gonna be kicking superhero butt, right?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. &ldquo;True. Well, I actually came to tell you that we have dance lessons this afternoon.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie almost choked on her water. &ldquo;Come again?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You heard me,&ldquo; I said, laughing now. &quot;My mum thought it would be &lsquo;fun&rsquo; to have dance lessons. Us, her and Isaac, my auntie, and thing one and thing two with their partners.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call them that, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Sorry, I meant dumb and dumber.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie gave me a knowing smile. &quot;Well, it does sound fun. And I could use the lessons. I&rsquo;m a terrible dancer.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re not. And we can probably get out of it if you say you don&rsquo;t wanna go,&ldquo; I pointed out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;But I want to go,&rdquo; she replied with a small smile. &ldquo;Worst comes to worst, we laugh at your cousins, right?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I thought about it for a moment, a mischievous smile forming on my lips. &ldquo;Very true.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed before checking her watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be done in like half an hour then we can grab some brunch and head down. Sound good?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded. &ldquo;Okay, have fun with&hellip; this.&rdquo; I motioned to the gym, making her laugh. I felt my stomach flip at the sound. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thanks,&ldquo; she said, rolling her eyes playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I left her to it, heading back up to my room to grab my book and go to the beach, but I ended up bumping into none other than Naomi. If it were up to me, I would&rsquo;ve just kept walking, but she thought to have an actual conversation, unfortunately. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N, how are things?&rdquo; she asked, her obnoxious grin on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I saw you yesterday,&ldquo; I said bluntly. &quot;Things are fine since you asked that. Yesterday.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She swallowed hard, and I could see her resisting the urge to roll her eyes. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Brie?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s at the gym. Look, is this important? I kinda have stuff to do.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Quite the engagement party your mum threw yesterday,&ldquo; she said, her smile fading. &quot;Lovely words exchanged between your mum and you and Brie.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Your point is?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She clenched her jaw and stepped forward, getting in my face and forcing me to stumble back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Look, you can lick your mum&rsquo;s arse all you want, but we all know she doesn&rsquo;t like you,&ldquo; she said angrily, glaring at me. &quot;I don&rsquo;t care what you do, you&rsquo;re not getting the firm.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. &ldquo;What the hell are you talking about?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play dumb, though I know that mustn&rsquo;t be hard for you.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I clenched my fists, trying ever so hard not to punch her right now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;There&rsquo;s something up with you and I&rsquo;m going to find out what it is,&ldquo; she continued, studying me. &quot;I think you&rsquo;re lying. Your mum is only showing mild interest in you because of Brie.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I froze momentarily, feeling caught. She couldn&rsquo;t know, could she? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Excellent move, I must admit,&ldquo; she said, smiling devilishly. &quot;Bringing a famous girlfriend to meet the parents. Talk about expert arse licking. But it won&rsquo;t work. I see right through you. And so will your mum. She&rsquo;s not going to give you the firm. I deserve it. And she&rsquo;ll see that.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What the hell are you going on about?!&ldquo; I asked with exasperation. &quot;Why do you keep mentioning the firm?!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Don&rsquo;t act like you don&rsquo;t know!&ldquo; she argued right back. &quot;I&rsquo;m going to find out what you&rsquo;re hiding. And your mum will see what a failure you are and you won&rsquo;t get the firm when she retires. She&rsquo;ll give it to Kieran and I, like we deserve. Good luck hiding.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows as she walked past me, nudging my shoulder purposely. I was angry at her for saying such hurtful things, but I was too confused to snap at her. My mum was retiring? And wanted to give me the firm? Why would she do that? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head and headed to my room, a million questions running through my mind still. But more importantly, I had to make sure Brie and I didn&rsquo;t get discovered by Naomi. That wouldn&rsquo;t look so good&hellip;</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie and I went to the hotel&rsquo;s ballroom that afternoon to find everyone already there, standing around and talking between each other. Some were stretching, others were on their phones, as if they were waiting for us. Oops? I saw the dance teacher stood in the corner, messing with her phone and a speaker. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;They&rsquo;re here!&ldquo; my mum shouted with delight when she saw us approaching. &quot;We can begin!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Ah, ladies, thank you for coming,&ldquo; the dance teacher said, walking to us. &quot;My name is Yara and I will be your dance teacher for today and tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hi,&ldquo; Brie and I greeted in response, Brie a little more enthusiastic than me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Okay, everybody stand with your partner, face to face, please!&rdquo; Yara instructed, pulling everyone into line. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You should have stopped your mother from booking this,&ldquo; Isaac mumbled as he walked past me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed at his expression. &quot;Are you serious?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Isaac gave me a pleading look before standing in front of my mum who was excited. I stood in front of a smiling Brie, her height a few inches over mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m assuming you all stretched before class, as I asked, so we&rsquo;re going to dive right in,&ldquo; Yara said, circling the room. &quot;We&rsquo;ll start with technique.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to be here,&ldquo; I muttered to Brie, making her grin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Shut up and listen,&rdquo; she ordered playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Traditionally, the male leads,&ldquo; Yara explained, &quot;but in the case of two women, you may choose the lead.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Bagsy being lead,&ldquo; I said quickly like a child. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thought you didn&rsquo;t want to be here,&rdquo; Brie said, chuckling quietly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey, I didn&rsquo;t know I was leading, so,&ldquo; I said with a shrug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I want the lead to rest a hand on the other&rsquo;s back, and another holding their hand,&rdquo; Yara instructed, moving around to help if need be. &ldquo;The partner should rest their hand on the lead&rsquo;s waist.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I did as Yara said, placing a hand in Brie&rsquo;s and resting the other on her back. I was surprised to feel how strong and defined it was and widened my eyes subconsciously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Holy shit,&ldquo; I blurted out quietly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You good?&rdquo; Brie asked, furrowing her eyebrows and smiling with confusion. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cleared my throat, nodding a little too enthusiastically. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Closer you two,&ldquo; Yara said, suddenly appearing by our side and pushing our bodies closer together. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I got a better grasp on Brie&rsquo;s back, making me gasp quietly and look over my shoulder to mumble another &quot;shit&rdquo; under my breath. Seriously, was she always this strong? Because <i>damn</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You sure you&rsquo;re okay?&ldquo; Brie asked, searching my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Mhm, yeah,&rdquo; I said, nodding and getting over myself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been&hellip; you&rsquo;ve gotten stronger, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Uh, I guess?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That&rsquo;s good,&ldquo; I said, nodding. &quot;Congrats.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled with confusion. &ldquo;Thaaaaanks&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of the hour was pretty much exactly like that. Me trying not to thirst over Brie&rsquo;s physique and also trying not to stand on her feet because apparently I wasn&rsquo;t as good at dancing as I thought. On the bright side, we&rsquo;d learnt a basic waltz and had one more lesson tomorrow to fine tune everything. It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought, and having Brie there made me forget how annoying Naomi and Kieran were. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Especially Naomi, who was eyeballing us whenever she could, as if trying to find a way to disprove our relationship. She was stupid, honestly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day&rsquo;s lesson went better, this time with myself able to dance with Brie and not have weird, not-friendly thoughts about her. But seriously though. When was she getting so strong and well-defined? I guess I hadn&rsquo;t been paying much attention until she was my 'girlfriend&rsquo;&hellip;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That evening, after our dance class and a dinner, the hotel were having a fireworks display on the beach, so of course everybody was outside on the sand with their loved ones, staring up at the sky, waiting for the display to start. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was sat with Brie, the two of us sat on a towel on the sand, with one blanket wrapped around both of us as we curled up next to each other. Her warmth was tickling my skin and I wasn&rsquo;t complaining one bit \u2013 it felt good. She was doing something to me these past few days and I had no idea what, but I liked it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;The sky looks so pretty,&ldquo; Brie said with a dreamy voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her and smiled. She was staring up at the stars with a lovestruck smile, her golden eyes sparkling under the sky. She looked stunning and I felt my stomach flip-flopping at the sight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;It does,&rdquo; I said, tearing my eyes away from her and looking to the sky. &ldquo;I like it out here.&rdquo; </p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With you</i>, I wanted to add, but didn&rsquo;t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Me, too,&ldquo; she agreed, before looking to me. &quot;Wait, d'you mean this beach or Hawaii in general?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her, meeting her eyes. &ldquo;Both. Makes this trip worth it.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled. &ldquo;Hawaii is always worth it, difficult family or not.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. &ldquo;True. It&rsquo;s only fun though because I&rsquo;m not alone.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was quiet for a moment, before saying, &ldquo;Is that your way of telling me you&rsquo;re glad I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suppressed a smile, feeling her eyes on me. &ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Knew it,&ldquo; she mumbled, making me laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You know, this whole fake dating thing makes things so easy,&rdquo; I realised aloud. &ldquo;I mean, people just assume because we&rsquo;re together that we do everything together, so they don&rsquo;t bother pulling us apart. Like we can stay in our room and avoid socialising and they don&rsquo;t question it. We can sit here now and not have to sit with my family because they think we&rsquo;re having a couple-y moment. It&rsquo;s super chill, y'know?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie chuckled. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just the perk of having a girlfriend, Y/N, not necessarily faking it.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Ooh, fireworks are gonna start,&ldquo; I said, shaking her arm a little. &quot;Ssshhh.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re the one speaking,&ldquo; she said, nudging me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Oh my god, you&rsquo;re such a child&hellip;&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched eagerly as the first firework was lit, shooting into the starry sky and bursting into a pretty burst of blue. It was followed by several more fireworks, all lighting up the sky with an array of colours. Everyone on the beach cheered as the display had officially begun. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;It&rsquo;s awesome,&rdquo; I said with a grin, looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded in agreement, mirroring my expression. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glanced around and realised everybody sat with their significant other was kissing them, in celebration of the display. I ignored it, knowing nobody would notice if Brie and I didn&rsquo;t, only to turn and meet Naomi&rsquo;s eyes across the beach. She was sat with her family and boyfriend, but she was eyeballing me curiously now, making me grow nervous. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie, kiss me,&ldquo; I said quickly, tearing my eyes from Naomi&rsquo;s terrorising ones. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie, who was once distracted by the fireworks display, now tore her gaze from the sky and looked to me with raised eyebrows. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glanced at Naomi, seeing a smirk forming on her lips. All I kept thinking about were her words from yesterday, about catching me out. Wanting to prove a point and not raise any suspicion, I leaned forward and smacked my lips against Brie&rsquo;s, kissing her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was taken by surprise, but rested a hand on my waist as I moved my lips against hers. I caressed her cheek, moving closer to feel more comfortable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled away after a moment, meeting Brie&rsquo;s eyes and subtly seeing if Naomi was staring still. She was glaring now, her smirk long gone as she turned away. I breathed out in relief and let go of Brie&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That was close,&ldquo; I got out, feeling a lot better, only to realise what I&rsquo;d done. I looked to Brie, eyes widening a little. &quot;Er, sorry. Everybody was kissing and Naomi saw that we weren&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t let her think otherwise&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie was still a little surprised, but nodded her head. She cleared her throat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, erm, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She awkwardly turned and looked back up to the sky, admiring the fireworks display. I did the same, moving back a little, suddenly feeling heat radiating between us. My lips were still tingling a little and I realised maybe I wanted to kiss her again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was a <i>really </i>good kisser.</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You okay?&ldquo; I asked Brie as she was finishing wiping the last of her makeup off in the bathroom mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yeah, why?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged, jumping into the bed. &ldquo;I dunno. You&rsquo;ve just been quiet since&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She paused her actions and I saw her eyes flicker to mine in the reflection of the mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry if I overstepped,&ldquo; I apologised, maintaining eye contact. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked away, looking down at the wipe in her hand. &quot;It&rsquo;s fine, Y/N, you don&rsquo;t need to apologise. It&rsquo;s not weird. I literally agreed to this.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I nodded. &ldquo;I know, but I just thought\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m fine,&ldquo; she said, smiling at me in the mirror. &quot;You&rsquo;re just seeing things.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded and watched as she finished wiping her makeup off. She hasn&rsquo;t said much after I kissed her earlier and I was worried I&rsquo;d upset her or something. But maybe she was right and I was just seeing into things. I mean, it was just a kiss, right? It didn&rsquo;t mean anything to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it might have meant something to me.</p>",

I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll love it, too!\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes. \u201cDo we get a choice?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really, now shoo, you\u2019re distracting me,\u201c she said, shoving me gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed and left her to her own devices, deciding to go find Brie. It was still early in the morning, so she\u2019d be at the hotel\u2019s gym doing her workout. I didn\u2019t know much, just that it was part of her nine month training to help prepare her for the part of Captain Marvel. She\u2019d promised her personal trainer she\u2019d keep up with it, so she\u2019d been going once every day since we got here a few days ago. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I headed to the gym, having to ask three different people for directions because I\u2019d never been there and hadn\u2019t really planned on it. I didn\u2019t even know the hotel <i>had </i>a gym until Brie asked when we first checked in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I got there, the gym had like eight people in it, as expected. I mean, who exercises on holiday? I saw Brie by the weights, a man next to her spot checking as she lifted the heavy bar. I approached them and tried not to choke on my own spit when I saw her lifting the weight with ease. How hadn\u2019t I noticed how strong she was before? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that Y/N?\u201d Brie asked, her eyes not leaving her spot on the ceiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\u201c I managed to get out, distracted by her muscles. I tried not to ogle, but she was wearing a sleeveless shirt and her muscles were literally rippling under the pressure of the weights. Now that I paid attention, I realised how fit she was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, I\u2019m stopping now,\u201d Brie said, having help from the tall guy to put the bar on the stand. She sat up and smiled at the man. \u201cThanks, Jack.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack saluted and left the two of us, giving me a friendly smile as he walked past. Brie breathed out and grabbed her water bottle, taking serval gulps before looking to me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything okay?\u201c she asked, grabbing her sweat towel and wiping her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Okay, was Brie always this hot or what? Did I miss something? Pretending to be girlfriend was clouding my judgement. She was my <i>friend</i>. I was being weird, right?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook it off and cleared my throat. \"Yeah, everything\u2019s cool. How\u2019s your workout going?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome. Not as good without my trainer, but Jack is one of the trainers here at the hotel and he\u2019s been helping me out a little. Gotta stay on track if I\u2019m gonna be kicking superhero butt, right?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. \u201cTrue. Well, I actually came to tell you that we have dance lessons this afternoon.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie almost choked on her water. \u201cCome again?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You heard me,\u201c I said, laughing now. \"My mum thought it would be \u2018fun\u2019 to have dance lessons. Us, her and Isaac, my auntie, and thing one and thing two with their partners.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t call them that, Y/N.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, I meant dumb and dumber.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie gave me a knowing smile. \"Well, it does sound fun. And I could use the lessons. I\u2019m a terrible dancer.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re not. And we can probably get out of it if you say you don\u2019t wanna go,\u201c I pointed out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But I want to go,\u201d she replied with a small smile. \u201cWorst comes to worst, we laugh at your cousins, right?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I thought about it for a moment, a mischievous smile forming on my lips. \u201cVery true.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed before checking her watch. \u201cI\u2019ll be done in like half an hour then we can grab some brunch and head down. Sound good?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded. \u201cOkay, have fun with\u2026 this.\u201d I motioned to the gym, making her laugh. I felt my stomach flip at the sound. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\u201c she said, rolling her eyes playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I left her to it, heading back up to my room to grab my book and go to the beach, but I ended up bumping into none other than Naomi. If it were up to me, I would\u2019ve just kept walking, but she thought to have an actual conversation, unfortunately. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N, how are things?\u201d she asked, her obnoxious grin on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I saw you yesterday,\u201c I said bluntly. \"Things are fine since you asked that. Yesterday.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She swallowed hard, and I could see her resisting the urge to roll her eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s Brie?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s at the gym. Look, is this important? I kinda have stuff to do.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quite the engagement party your mum threw yesterday,\u201c she said, her smile fading. \"Lovely words exchanged between your mum and you and Brie.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised an eyebrow. \u201cYour point is?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She clenched her jaw and stepped forward, getting in my face and forcing me to stumble back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, you can lick your mum\u2019s arse all you want, but we all know she doesn\u2019t like you,\u201c she said angrily, glaring at me. \"I don\u2019t care what you do, you\u2019re not getting the firm.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \u201cDon\u2019t play dumb, though I know that mustn\u2019t be hard for you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I clenched my fists, trying ever so hard not to punch her right now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There\u2019s something up with you and I\u2019m going to find out what it is,\u201c she continued, studying me. \"I think you\u2019re lying. Your mum is only showing mild interest in you because of Brie.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I froze momentarily, feeling caught. She couldn\u2019t know, could she? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excellent move, I must admit,\u201c she said, smiling devilishly. \"Bringing a famous girlfriend to meet the parents. Talk about expert arse licking. But it won\u2019t work. I see right through you. And so will your mum. She\u2019s not going to give you the firm. I deserve it. And she\u2019ll see that.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell are you going on about?!\u201c I asked with exasperation. \"Why do you keep mentioning the firm?!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know!\u201c she argued right back. \"I\u2019m going to find out what you\u2019re hiding. And your mum will see what a failure you are and you won\u2019t get the firm when she retires. She\u2019ll give it to Kieran and I, like we deserve. Good luck hiding.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows as she walked past me, nudging my shoulder purposely. I was angry at her for saying such hurtful things, but I was too confused to snap at her. My mum was retiring? And wanted to give me the firm? Why would she do that? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head and headed to my room, a million questions running through my mind still. But more importantly, I had to make sure Brie and I didn\u2019t get discovered by Naomi. That wouldn\u2019t look so good\u2026</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie and I went to the hotel\u2019s ballroom that afternoon to find everyone already there, standing around and talking between each other. Some were stretching, others were on their phones, as if they were waiting for us. Oops? I saw the dance teacher stood in the corner, messing with her phone and a speaker. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They\u2019re here!\u201c my mum shouted with delight when she saw us approaching. \"We can begin!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, ladies, thank you for coming,\u201c the dance teacher said, walking to us. \"My name is Yara and I will be your dance teacher for today and tomorrow.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi,\u201c Brie and I greeted in response, Brie a little more enthusiastic than me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, everybody stand with your partner, face to face, please!\u201d Yara instructed, pulling everyone into line. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should have stopped your mother from booking this,\u201c Isaac mumbled as he walked past me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed at his expression. \"Are you serious?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Isaac gave me a pleading look before standing in front of my mum who was excited. I stood in front of a smiling Brie, her height a few inches over mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m assuming you all stretched before class, as I asked, so we\u2019re going to dive right in,\u201c Yara said, circling the room. \"We\u2019ll start with technique.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to be here,\u201c I muttered to Brie, making her grin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shut up and listen,\u201d she ordered playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Traditionally, the male leads,\u201c Yara explained, \"but in the case of two women, you may choose the lead.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bagsy being lead,\u201c I said quickly like a child. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thought you didn\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Brie said, chuckling quietly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, I didn\u2019t know I was leading, so,\u201c I said with a shrug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I want the lead to rest a hand on the other\u2019s back, and another holding their hand,\u201d Yara instructed, moving around to help if need be. \u201cThe partner should rest their hand on the lead\u2019s waist.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I did as Yara said, placing a hand in Brie\u2019s and resting the other on her back. I was surprised to feel how strong and defined it was and widened my eyes subconsciously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Holy shit,\u201c I blurted out quietly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You good?\u201d Brie asked, furrowing her eyebrows and smiling with confusion. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cleared my throat, nodding a little too enthusiastically. \u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Closer you two,\u201c Yara said, suddenly appearing by our side and pushing our bodies closer together. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I got a better grasp on Brie\u2019s back, making me gasp quietly and look over my shoulder to mumble another \"shit\u201d under my breath. Seriously, was she always this strong? Because <i>damn</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure you\u2019re okay?\u201c Brie asked, searching my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mhm, yeah,\u201d I said, nodding and getting over myself. \u201cYou\u2019ve been\u2026 you\u2019ve gotten stronger, haven\u2019t you?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile and raised an eyebrow. \u201cUh, I guess?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s good,\u201c I said, nodding. \"Congrats.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled with confusion. \u201cThaaaaanks\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of the hour was pretty much exactly like that. Me trying not to thirst over Brie\u2019s physique and also trying not to stand on her feet because apparently I wasn\u2019t as good at dancing as I thought. On the bright side, we\u2019d learnt a basic waltz and had one more lesson tomorrow to fine tune everything. It wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought, and having Brie there made me forget how annoying Naomi and Kieran were. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Especially Naomi, who was eyeballing us whenever she could, as if trying to find a way to disprove our relationship. She was stupid, honestly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day\u2019s lesson went better, this time with myself able to dance with Brie and not have weird, not-friendly thoughts about her. But seriously though. When was she getting so strong and well-defined? I guess I hadn\u2019t been paying much attention until she was my 'girlfriend\u2019\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That evening, after our dance class and a dinner, the hotel were having a fireworks display on the beach, so of course everybody was outside on the sand with their loved ones, staring up at the sky, waiting for the display to start. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was sat with Brie, the two of us sat on a towel on the sand, with one blanket wrapped around both of us as we curled up next to each other. Her warmth was tickling my skin and I wasn\u2019t complaining one bit \u2013 it felt good. She was doing something to me these past few days and I had no idea what, but I liked it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The sky looks so pretty,\u201c Brie said with a dreamy voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her and smiled. She was staring up at the stars with a lovestruck smile, her golden eyes sparkling under the sky. She looked stunning and I felt my stomach flip-flopping at the sight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It does,\u201d I said, tearing my eyes away from her and looking to the sky. \u201cI like it out here.\u201d </p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With you</i>, I wanted to add, but didn\u2019t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me, too,\u201c she agreed, before looking to me. \"Wait, d'you mean this beach or Hawaii in general?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her, meeting her eyes. \u201cBoth. Makes this trip worth it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled. \u201cHawaii is always worth it, difficult family or not.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. \u201cTrue. It\u2019s only fun though because I\u2019m not alone.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was quiet for a moment, before saying, \u201cIs that your way of telling me you\u2019re glad I\u2019m here?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suppressed a smile, feeling her eyes on me. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Knew it,\u201c she mumbled, making me laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, this whole fake dating thing makes things so easy,\u201d I realised aloud. \u201cI mean, people just assume because we\u2019re together that we do everything together, so they don\u2019t bother pulling us apart. Like we can stay in our room and avoid socialising and they don\u2019t question it. We can sit here now and not have to sit with my family because they think we\u2019re having a couple-y moment. It\u2019s super chill, y'know?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie chuckled. \u201cI think that\u2019s just the perk of having a girlfriend, Y/N, not necessarily faking it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged. \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooh, fireworks are gonna start,\u201c I said, shaking her arm a little. \"Ssshhh.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re the one speaking,\u201c she said, nudging me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god, you\u2019re such a child\u2026\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched eagerly as the first firework was lit, shooting into the starry sky and bursting into a pretty burst of blue. It was followed by several more fireworks, all lighting up the sky with an array of colours. Everyone on the beach cheered as the display had officially begun. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It\u2019s awesome,\u201d I said with a grin, looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded in agreement, mirroring my expression. \u201cIt is.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glanced around and realised everybody sat with their significant other was kissing them, in celebration of the display. I ignored it, knowing nobody would notice if Brie and I didn\u2019t, only to turn and meet Naomi\u2019s eyes across the beach. She was sat with her family and boyfriend, but she was eyeballing me curiously now, making me grow nervous. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, kiss me,\u201c I said quickly, tearing my eyes from Naomi\u2019s terrorising ones. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie, who was once distracted by the fireworks display, now tore her gaze from the sky and looked to me with raised eyebrows. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glanced at Naomi, seeing a smirk forming on her lips. All I kept thinking about were her words from yesterday, about catching me out. Wanting to prove a point and not raise any suspicion, I leaned forward and smacked my lips against Brie\u2019s, kissing her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was taken by surprise, but rested a hand on my waist as I moved my lips against hers. I caressed her cheek, moving closer to feel more comfortable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled away after a moment, meeting Brie\u2019s eyes and subtly seeing if Naomi was staring still. She was glaring now, her smirk long gone as she turned away. I breathed out in relief and let go of Brie\u2019s cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was close,\u201c I got out, feeling a lot better, only to realise what I\u2019d done. I looked to Brie, eyes widening a little. \"Er, sorry. Everybody was kissing and Naomi saw that we weren\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t let her think otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie was still a little surprised, but nodded her head. She cleared her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, erm, yeah\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She awkwardly turned and looked back up to the sky, admiring the fireworks display. I did the same, moving back a little, suddenly feeling heat radiating between us. My lips were still tingling a little and I realised maybe I wanted to kiss her again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was a <i>really </i>good kisser.</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You okay?\u201c I asked Brie as she was finishing wiping the last of her makeup off in the bathroom mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, why?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged, jumping into the bed. \u201cI dunno. You\u2019ve just been quiet since\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She paused her actions and I saw her eyes flicker to mine in the reflection of the mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry if I overstepped,\u201c I apologised, maintaining eye contact. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked away, looking down at the wipe in her hand. \"It\u2019s fine, Y/N, you don\u2019t need to apologise. It\u2019s not weird. I literally agreed to this.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I nodded. \u201cI know, but I just thought\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m fine,\u201c she said, smiling at me in the mirror. \"You\u2019re just seeing things.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded and watched as she finished wiping her makeup off. She hasn\u2019t said much after I kissed her earlier and I was worried I\u2019d upset her or something. But maybe she was right and I was just seeing into things. I mean, it was just a kiss, right? It didn\u2019t mean anything to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it might have meant something to me.</p>",

What\u2019s wrong with some dance lessons to help you out when it comes to the wedding reception?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The dance lessons bit,\u201c I pointed out. \"And the bit where Naomi and Kieran are there.

It was still early in the morning, so she\u2019d be at the hotel\u2019s gym doing her workout. I didn\u2019t know much, just that it was part of her nine month training to help prepare her for the part of Captain Marvel. She\u2019d promised her personal trainer she\u2019d keep up with it, so she\u2019d been going once every day since we got here a few days ago. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I headed to the gym, having to ask three different people for directions because I\u2019d never been there and hadn\u2019t really planned on it. I didn\u2019t even know the hotel <i>had </i>a gym until Brie asked when we first checked in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I got there, the gym had like eight people in it, as expected. I mean, who exercises on holiday? I saw Brie by the weights, a man next to her spot checking as she lifted the heavy bar. I approached them and tried not to choke on my own spit when I saw her lifting the weight with ease. How hadn\u2019t I noticed how strong she was before? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that Y/N?\u201d Brie asked, her eyes not leaving her spot on the ceiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\u201c I managed to get out, distracted by her muscles. I tried not to ogle, but she was wearing a sleeveless shirt and her muscles were literally rippling under the pressure of the weights. Now that I paid attention, I realised how fit she was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, I\u2019m stopping now,\u201d Brie said, having help from the tall guy to put the bar on the stand. She sat up and smiled at the man. \u201cThanks, Jack.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack saluted and left the two of us, giving me a friendly smile as he walked past. Brie breathed out and grabbed her water bottle, taking serval gulps before looking to me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything okay?\u201c she asked, grabbing her sweat towel and wiping her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Okay, was Brie always this hot or what? Did I miss something? Pretending to be girlfriend was clouding my judgement. She was my <i>friend</i>. I was being weird, right?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook it off and cleared my throat. \"Yeah, everything\u2019s cool. How\u2019s your workout going?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome. Not as good without my trainer, but Jack is one of the trainers here at the hotel and he\u2019s been helping me out a little. Gotta stay on track if I\u2019m gonna be kicking superhero butt, right?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. \u201cTrue. Well, I actually came to tell you that we have dance lessons this afternoon.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie almost choked on her water. \u201cCome again?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You heard me,\u201c I said, laughing now. \"My mum thought it would be \u2018fun\u2019 to have dance lessons. Us, her and Isaac, my auntie, and thing one and thing two with their partners.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t call them that, Y/N.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, I meant dumb and dumber.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie gave me a knowing smile. \"Well, it does sound fun. And I could use the lessons. I\u2019m a terrible dancer.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re not. And we can probably get out of it if you say you don\u2019t wanna go,\u201c I pointed out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But I want to go,\u201d she replied with a small smile. \u201cWorst comes to worst, we laugh at your cousins, right?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I thought about it for a moment, a mischievous smile forming on my lips. \u201cVery true.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed before checking her watch. \u201cI\u2019ll be done in like half an hour then we can grab some brunch and head down. Sound good?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded. \u201cOkay, have fun with\u2026 this.\u201d I motioned to the gym, making her laugh. I felt my stomach flip at the sound. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\u201c she said, rolling her eyes playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I left her to it, heading back up to my room to grab my book and go to the beach, but I ended up bumping into none other than Naomi. If it were up to me, I would\u2019ve just kept walking, but she thought to have an actual conversation, unfortunately. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N, how are things?\u201d she asked, her obnoxious grin on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I saw you yesterday,\u201c I said bluntly. \"Things are fine since you asked that. Yesterday.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She swallowed hard, and I could see her resisting the urge to roll her eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s Brie?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s at the gym. Look, is this important? I kinda have stuff to do.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quite the engagement party your mum threw yesterday,\u201c she said, her smile fading. \"Lovely words exchanged between your mum and you and Brie.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised an eyebrow. \u201cYour point is?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She clenched her jaw and stepped forward, getting in my face and forcing me to stumble back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, you can lick your mum\u2019s arse all you want, but we all know she doesn\u2019t like you,\u201c she said angrily, glaring at me. \"I don\u2019t care what you do, you\u2019re not getting the firm.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \u201cDon\u2019t play dumb, though I know that mustn\u2019t be hard for you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I clenched my fists, trying ever so hard not to punch her right now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There\u2019s something up with you and I\u2019m going to find out what it is,\u201c she continued, studying me. \"I think you\u2019re lying. Your mum is only showing mild interest in you because of Brie.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I froze momentarily, feeling caught. She couldn\u2019t know, could she? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excellent move, I must admit,\u201c she said, smiling devilishly. \"Bringing a famous girlfriend to meet the parents. Talk about expert arse licking. But it won\u2019t work. I see right through you. And so will your mum. She\u2019s not going to give you the firm. I deserve it. And she\u2019ll see that.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell are you going on about?!\u201c I asked with exasperation. \"Why do you keep mentioning the firm?!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know!\u201c she argued right back. \"I\u2019m going to find out what you\u2019re hiding. And your mum will see what a failure you are and you won\u2019t get the firm when she retires. She\u2019ll give it to Kieran and I, like we deserve. Good luck hiding.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows as she walked past me, nudging my shoulder purposely. I was angry at her for saying such hurtful things, but I was too confused to snap at her. My mum was retiring? And wanted to give me the firm? Why would she do that? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head and headed to my room, a million questions running through my mind still. But more importantly, I had to make sure Brie and I didn\u2019t get discovered by Naomi. That wouldn\u2019t look so good\u2026</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie and I went to the hotel\u2019s ballroom that afternoon to find everyone already there, standing around and talking between each other. Some were stretching, others were on their phones, as if they were waiting for us. Oops? I saw the dance teacher stood in the corner, messing with her phone and a speaker. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They\u2019re here!\u201c my mum shouted with delight when she saw us approaching. \"We can begin!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, ladies, thank you for coming,\u201c the dance teacher said, walking to us. \"My name is Yara and I will be your dance teacher for today and tomorrow.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi,\u201c Brie and I greeted in response, Brie a little more enthusiastic than me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, everybody stand with your partner, face to face, please!\u201d Yara instructed, pulling everyone into line. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should have stopped your mother from booking this,\u201c Isaac mumbled as he walked past me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed at his expression. \"Are you serious?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Isaac gave me a pleading look before standing in front of my mum who was excited. I stood in front of a smiling Brie, her height a few inches over mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m assuming you all stretched before class, as I asked, so we\u2019re going to dive right in,\u201c Yara said, circling the room. \"We\u2019ll start with technique.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to be here,\u201c I muttered to Brie, making her grin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shut up and listen,\u201d she ordered playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Traditionally, the male leads,\u201c Yara explained, \"but in the case of two women, you may choose the lead.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bagsy being lead,\u201c I said quickly like a child. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thought you didn\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Brie said, chuckling quietly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, I didn\u2019t know I was leading, so,\u201c I said with a shrug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I want the lead to rest a hand on the other\u2019s back, and another holding their hand,\u201d Yara instructed, moving around to help if need be. \u201cThe partner should rest their hand on the lead\u2019s waist.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I did as Yara said, placing a hand in Brie\u2019s and resting the other on her back. I was surprised to feel how strong and defined it was and widened my eyes subconsciously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Holy shit,\u201c I blurted out quietly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You good?\u201d Brie asked, furrowing her eyebrows and smiling with confusion. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cleared my throat, nodding a little too enthusiastically. \u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Closer you two,\u201c Yara said, suddenly appearing by our side and pushing our bodies closer together. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I got a better grasp on Brie\u2019s back, making me gasp quietly and look over my shoulder to mumble another \"shit\u201d under my breath. Seriously, was she always this strong? Because <i>damn</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure you\u2019re okay?\u201c Brie asked, searching my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mhm, yeah,\u201d I said, nodding and getting over myself. \u201cYou\u2019ve been\u2026 you\u2019ve gotten stronger, haven\u2019t you?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile and raised an eyebrow. \u201cUh, I guess?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s good,\u201c I said, nodding. \"Congrats.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled with confusion. \u201cThaaaaanks\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of the hour was pretty much exactly like that. Me trying not to thirst over Brie\u2019s physique and also trying not to stand on her feet because apparently I wasn\u2019t as good at dancing as I thought. On the bright side, we\u2019d learnt a basic waltz and had one more lesson tomorrow to fine tune everything. It wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought, and having Brie there made me forget how annoying Naomi and Kieran were. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Especially Naomi, who was eyeballing us whenever she could, as if trying to find a way to disprove our relationship. She was stupid, honestly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day\u2019s lesson went better, this time with myself able to dance with Brie and not have weird, not-friendly thoughts about her. But seriously though. When was she getting so strong and well-defined? I guess I hadn\u2019t been paying much attention until she was my 'girlfriend\u2019\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That evening, after our dance class and a dinner, the hotel were having a fireworks display on the beach, so of course everybody was outside on the sand with their loved ones, staring up at the sky, waiting for the display to start. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was sat with Brie, the two of us sat on a towel on the sand, with one blanket wrapped around both of us as we curled up next to each other. Her warmth was tickling my skin and I wasn\u2019t complaining one bit \u2013 it felt good. She was doing something to me these past few days and I had no idea what, but I liked it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The sky looks so pretty,\u201c Brie said with a dreamy voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her and smiled. She was staring up at the stars with a lovestruck smile, her golden eyes sparkling under the sky. She looked stunning and I felt my stomach flip-flopping at the sight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It does,\u201d I said, tearing my eyes away from her and looking to the sky. \u201cI like it out here.\u201d </p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With you</i>, I wanted to add, but didn\u2019t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me, too,\u201c she agreed, before looking to me. \"Wait, d'you mean this beach or Hawaii in general?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her, meeting her eyes. \u201cBoth. Makes this trip worth it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled. \u201cHawaii is always worth it, difficult family or not.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. \u201cTrue. It\u2019s only fun though because I\u2019m not alone.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was quiet for a moment, before saying, \u201cIs that your way of telling me you\u2019re glad I\u2019m here?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suppressed a smile, feeling her eyes on me. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Knew it,\u201c she mumbled, making me laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, this whole fake dating thing makes things so easy,\u201d I realised aloud. \u201cI mean, people just assume because we\u2019re together that we do everything together, so they don\u2019t bother pulling us apart. Like we can stay in our room and avoid socialising and they don\u2019t question it. We can sit here now and not have to sit with my family because they think we\u2019re having a couple-y moment. It\u2019s super chill, y'know?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie chuckled. \u201cI think that\u2019s just the perk of having a girlfriend, Y/N, not necessarily faking it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged. \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes playfully. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooh, fireworks are gonna start,\u201c I said, shaking her arm a little. \"Ssshhh.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re the one speaking,\u201c she said, nudging me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god, you\u2019re such a child\u2026\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched eagerly as the first firework was lit, shooting into the starry sky and bursting into a pretty burst of blue. It was followed by several more fireworks, all lighting up the sky with an array of colours. Everyone on the beach cheered as the display had officially begun. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It\u2019s awesome,\u201d I said with a grin, looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded in agreement, mirroring my expression. \u201cIt is.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glanced around and realised everybody sat with their significant other was kissing them, in celebration of the display. I ignored it, knowing nobody would notice if Brie and I didn\u2019t, only to turn and meet Naomi\u2019s eyes across the beach. She was sat with her family and boyfriend, but she was eyeballing me curiously now, making me grow nervous. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, kiss me,\u201c I said quickly, tearing my eyes from Naomi\u2019s terrorising ones. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie, who was once distracted by the fireworks display, now tore her gaze from the sky and looked to me with raised eyebrows. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glanced at Naomi, seeing a smirk forming on her lips. All I kept thinking about were her words from yesterday, about catching me out. Wanting to prove a point and not raise any suspicion, I leaned forward and smacked my lips against Brie\u2019s, kissing her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was taken by surprise, but rested a hand on my waist as I moved my lips against hers. I caressed her cheek, moving closer to feel more comfortable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled away after a moment, meeting Brie\u2019s eyes and subtly seeing if Naomi was staring still. She was glaring now, her smirk long gone as she turned away. I breathed out in relief and let go of Brie\u2019s cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was close,\u201c I got out, feeling a lot better, only to realise what I\u2019d done. I looked to Brie, eyes widening a little. \"Er, sorry. Everybody was kissing and Naomi saw that we weren\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t let her think otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie was still a little surprised, but nodded her head. She cleared her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, erm, yeah\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She awkwardly turned and looked back up to the sky, admiring the fireworks display. I did the same, moving back a little, suddenly feeling heat radiating between us. My lips were still tingling a little and I realised maybe I wanted to kiss her again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was a <i>really </i>good kisser.</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You okay?\u201c I asked Brie as she was finishing wiping the last of her makeup off in the bathroom mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, why?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged, jumping into the bed. \u201cI dunno. You\u2019ve just been quiet since\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She paused her actions and I saw her eyes flicker to mine in the reflection of the mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry if I overstepped,\u201c I apologised, maintaining eye contact. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked away, looking down at the wipe in her hand. \"It\u2019s fine, Y/N, you don\u2019t need to apologise. It\u2019s not weird. I literally agreed to this.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I nodded. \u201cI know, but I just thought\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m fine,\u201c she said, smiling at me in the mirror. \"You\u2019re just seeing things.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded and watched as she finished wiping her makeup off. She hasn\u2019t said much after I kissed her earlier and I was worried I\u2019d upset her or something. But maybe she was right and I was just seeing into things. I mean, it was just a kiss, right? It didn\u2019t mean anything to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it might have meant something to me.</p>",

She never failed to surprise me. &ldquo;I can dance!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I never said you couldn&rsquo;t,&ldquo; she said, her attention on a guest list. \"It&rsquo;s supposed to be fun, Y/N. I booked it for Isaac and I, you and Brie, my sister, Naomi, Kieran and their partners. What&rsquo;s wrong with some dance lessons to help you out when it comes to the wedding reception?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"The dance lessons bit,&ldquo; I pointed out. \"And the bit where Naomi and Kieran are there. Oh, yeah, and the bit where it&rsquo;s happening later on this afternoon. And again tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"All in time for the wedding at the end of the week,&ldquo; she said, finally meeting me eyes with a knowing look. \"Quit complaining. You&rsquo;ll love it. You should go tell Brie. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll love it, too!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Do we get a choice?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Not really, now shoo, you&rsquo;re distracting me,&ldquo; she said, shoving me gently. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed and left her to her own devices, deciding to go find Brie. It was still early in the morning, so she&rsquo;d be at the hotel&rsquo;s gym doing her workout. I didn&rsquo;t know much, just that it was part of her nine month training to help prepare her for the part of Captain Marvel. She&rsquo;d promised her personal trainer she&rsquo;d keep up with it, so she&rsquo;d been going once every day since we got here a few days ago. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I headed to the gym, having to ask three different people for directions because I&rsquo;d never been there and hadn&rsquo;t really planned on it. I didn&rsquo;t even know the hotel <i>had </i>a gym until Brie asked when we first checked in. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I got there, the gym had like eight people in it, as expected. I mean, who exercises on holiday? I saw Brie by the weights, a man next to her spot checking as she lifted the heavy bar. I approached them and tried not to choke on my own spit when I saw her lifting the weight with ease. How hadn&rsquo;t I noticed how strong she was before? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Is that Y/N?&rdquo; Brie asked, her eyes not leaving her spot on the ceiling. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yeah,&ldquo; I managed to get out, distracted by her muscles. I tried not to ogle, but she was wearing a sleeveless shirt and her muscles were literally rippling under the pressure of the weights. Now that I paid attention, I realised how fit she was. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Okay, I&rsquo;m stopping now,&rdquo; Brie said, having help from the tall guy to put the bar on the stand. She sat up and smiled at the man. &ldquo;Thanks, Jack.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack saluted and left the two of us, giving me a friendly smile as he walked past. Brie breathed out and grabbed her water bottle, taking serval gulps before looking to me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Everything okay?&ldquo; she asked, grabbing her sweat towel and wiping her face. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Okay, was Brie always this hot or what? Did I miss something? Pretending to be girlfriend was clouding my judgement. She was my <i>friend</i>. I was being weird, right?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook it off and cleared my throat. \"Yeah, everything&rsquo;s cool. How&rsquo;s your workout going?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awesome. Not as good without my trainer, but Jack is one of the trainers here at the hotel and he&rsquo;s been helping me out a little. Gotta stay on track if I&rsquo;m gonna be kicking superhero butt, right?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chuckled. &ldquo;True. Well, I actually came to tell you that we have dance lessons this afternoon.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie almost choked on her water. &ldquo;Come again?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You heard me,&ldquo; I said, laughing now. \"My mum thought it would be &lsquo;fun&rsquo; to have dance lessons. Us, her and Isaac, my auntie, and thing one and thing two with their partners.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call them that, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Sorry, I meant dumb and dumber.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie gave me a knowing smile. \"Well, it does sound fun. And I could use the lessons. I&rsquo;m a terrible dancer.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re not. And we can probably get out of it if you say you don&rsquo;t wanna go,&ldquo; I pointed out. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"But I want to go,&rdquo; she replied with a small smile. &ldquo;Worst comes to worst, we laugh at your cousins, right?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I thought about it for a moment, a mischievous smile forming on my lips. &ldquo;Very true.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed before checking her watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be done in like half an hour then we can grab some brunch and head down. Sound good?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded. &ldquo;Okay, have fun with&hellip; this.&rdquo; I motioned to the gym, making her laugh. I felt my stomach flip at the sound. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thanks,&ldquo; she said, rolling her eyes playfully. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I left her to it, heading back up to my room to grab my book and go to the beach, but I ended up bumping into none other than Naomi. If it were up to me, I would&rsquo;ve just kept walking, but she thought to have an actual conversation, unfortunately. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N, how are things?&rdquo; she asked, her obnoxious grin on her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I saw you yesterday,&ldquo; I said bluntly. \"Things are fine since you asked that. Yesterday.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She swallowed hard, and I could see her resisting the urge to roll her eyes. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Brie?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s at the gym. Look, is this important? I kinda have stuff to do.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Quite the engagement party your mum threw yesterday,&ldquo; she said, her smile fading. \"Lovely words exchanged between your mum and you and Brie.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Your point is?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She clenched her jaw and stepped forward, getting in my face and forcing me to stumble back. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Look, you can lick your mum&rsquo;s arse all you want, but we all know she doesn&rsquo;t like you,&ldquo; she said angrily, glaring at me. \"I don&rsquo;t care what you do, you&rsquo;re not getting the firm.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pulled a face. &ldquo;What the hell are you talking about?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play dumb, though I know that mustn&rsquo;t be hard for you.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I clenched my fists, trying ever so hard not to punch her right now. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"There&rsquo;s something up with you and I&rsquo;m going to find out what it is,&ldquo; she continued, studying me. \"I think you&rsquo;re lying. Your mum is only showing mild interest in you because of Brie.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I froze momentarily, feeling caught. She couldn&rsquo;t know, could she? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Excellent move, I must admit,&ldquo; she said, smiling devilishly. \"Bringing a famous girlfriend to meet the parents. Talk about expert arse licking. But it won&rsquo;t work. I see right through you. And so will your mum. She&rsquo;s not going to give you the firm. I deserve it. And she&rsquo;ll see that.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What the hell are you going on about?!&ldquo; I asked with exasperation. \"Why do you keep mentioning the firm?!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Don&rsquo;t act like you don&rsquo;t know!&ldquo; she argued right back. \"I&rsquo;m going to find out what you&rsquo;re hiding. And your mum will see what a failure you are and you won&rsquo;t get the firm when she retires. She&rsquo;ll give it to Kieran and I, like we deserve. Good luck hiding.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I furrowed my eyebrows as she walked past me, nudging my shoulder purposely. I was angry at her for saying such hurtful things, but I was too confused to snap at her. My mum was retiring? And wanted to give me the firm? Why would she do that? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook my head and headed to my room, a million questions running through my mind still. But more importantly, I had to make sure Brie and I didn&rsquo;t get discovered by Naomi. That wouldn&rsquo;t look so good&hellip;</p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie and I went to the hotel&rsquo;s ballroom that afternoon to find everyone already there, standing around and talking between each other. Some were stretching, others were on their phones, as if they were waiting for us. Oops? I saw the dance teacher stood in the corner, messing with her phone and a speaker. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"They&rsquo;re here!&ldquo; my mum shouted with delight when she saw us approaching. \"We can begin!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Ah, ladies, thank you for coming,&ldquo; the dance teacher said, walking to us. \"My name is Yara and I will be your dance teacher for today and tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hi,&ldquo; Brie and I greeted in response, Brie a little more enthusiastic than me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Okay, everybody stand with your partner, face to face, please!&rdquo; Yara instructed, pulling everyone into line. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You should have stopped your mother from booking this,&ldquo; Isaac mumbled as he walked past me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed at his expression. \"Are you serious?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isaac gave me a pleading look before standing in front of my mum who was excited. I stood in front of a smiling Brie, her height a few inches over mine. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m assuming you all stretched before class, as I asked, so we&rsquo;re going to dive right in,&ldquo; Yara said, circling the room. \"We&rsquo;ll start with technique.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I don&rsquo;t want to be here,&ldquo; I muttered to Brie, making her grin. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Shut up and listen,&rdquo; she ordered playfully. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Traditionally, the male leads,&ldquo; Yara explained, \"but in the case of two women, you may choose the lead.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Bagsy being lead,&ldquo; I said quickly like a child. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thought you didn&rsquo;t want to be here,&rdquo; Brie said, chuckling quietly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey, I didn&rsquo;t know I was leading, so,&ldquo; I said with a shrug. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I want the lead to rest a hand on the other&rsquo;s back, and another holding their hand,&rdquo; Yara instructed, moving around to help if need be. &ldquo;The partner should rest their hand on the lead&rsquo;s waist.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I did as Yara said, placing a hand in Brie&rsquo;s and resting the other on her back. I was surprised to feel how strong and defined it was and widened my eyes subconsciously. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Holy shit,&ldquo; I blurted out quietly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You good?&rdquo; Brie asked, furrowing her eyebrows and smiling with confusion. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I cleared my throat, nodding a little too enthusiastically. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Closer you two,&ldquo; Yara said, suddenly appearing by our side and pushing our bodies closer together. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got a better grasp on Brie&rsquo;s back, making me gasp quietly and look over my shoulder to mumble another \"shit&rdquo; under my breath. Seriously, was she always this strong? Because <i>damn</i>. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You sure you&rsquo;re okay?&ldquo; Brie asked, searching my eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Mhm, yeah,&rdquo; I said, nodding and getting over myself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been&hellip; you&rsquo;ve gotten stronger, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She suppressed a smile and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Uh, I guess?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That&rsquo;s good,&ldquo; I said, nodding. \"Congrats.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She smiled with confusion. &ldquo;Thaaaaanks&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of the hour was pretty much exactly like that. Me trying not to thirst over Brie&rsquo;s physique and also trying not to stand on her feet because apparently I wasn&rsquo;t as good at dancing as I thought. On the bright side, we&rsquo;d learnt a basic waltz and had one more lesson tomorrow to fine tune everything. It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought, and having Brie there made me forget how annoying Naomi and Kieran were. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Especially Naomi, who was eyeballing us whenever she could, as if trying to find a way to disprove our relationship. She was stupid, honestly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next day&rsquo;s lesson went better, this time with myself able to dance with Brie and not have weird, not-friendly thoughts about her. But seriously though. When was she getting so strong and well-defined? I guess I hadn&rsquo;t been paying much attention until she was my 'girlfriend&rsquo;&hellip;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That evening, after our dance class and a dinner, the hotel were having a fireworks display on the beach, so of course everybody was outside on the sand with their loved ones, staring up at the sky, waiting for the display to start. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was sat with Brie, the two of us sat on a towel on the sand, with one blanket wrapped around both of us as we curled up next to each other. Her warmth was tickling my skin and I wasn&rsquo;t complaining one bit &ndash; it felt good. She was doing something to me these past few days and I had no idea what, but I liked it. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"The sky looks so pretty,&ldquo; Brie said with a dreamy voice. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked to her and smiled. She was staring up at the stars with a lovestruck smile, her golden eyes sparkling under the sky. She looked stunning and I felt my stomach flip-flopping at the sight. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"It does,&rdquo; I said, tearing my eyes away from her and looking to the sky. &ldquo;I like it out here.&rdquo; </p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With you</i>, I wanted to add, but didn&rsquo;t. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Me, too,&ldquo; she agreed, before looking to me. \"Wait, d'you mean this beach or Hawaii in general?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked to her, meeting her eyes. &ldquo;Both. Makes this trip worth it.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She smiled. &ldquo;Hawaii is always worth it, difficult family or not.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed. &ldquo;True. It&rsquo;s only fun though because I&rsquo;m not alone.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was quiet for a moment, before saying, &ldquo;Is that your way of telling me you&rsquo;re glad I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suppressed a smile, feeling her eyes on me. &ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Knew it,&ldquo; she mumbled, making me laugh. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You know, this whole fake dating thing makes things so easy,&rdquo; I realised aloud. &ldquo;I mean, people just assume because we&rsquo;re together that we do everything together, so they don&rsquo;t bother pulling us apart. Like we can stay in our room and avoid socialising and they don&rsquo;t question it. We can sit here now and not have to sit with my family because they think we&rsquo;re having a couple-y moment. It&rsquo;s super chill, y'know?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie chuckled. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just the perk of having a girlfriend, Y/N, not necessarily faking it.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rolled her eyes playfully. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Ooh, fireworks are gonna start,&ldquo; I said, shaking her arm a little. \"Ssshhh.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re the one speaking,&ldquo; she said, nudging me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Oh my god, you&rsquo;re such a child&hellip;&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched eagerly as the first firework was lit, shooting into the starry sky and bursting into a pretty burst of blue. It was followed by several more fireworks, all lighting up the sky with an array of colours. Everyone on the beach cheered as the display had officially begun. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"It&rsquo;s awesome,&rdquo; I said with a grin, looking to Brie. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded in agreement, mirroring my expression. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glanced around and realised everybody sat with their significant other was kissing them, in celebration of the display. I ignored it, knowing nobody would notice if Brie and I didn&rsquo;t, only to turn and meet Naomi&rsquo;s eyes across the beach. She was sat with her family and boyfriend, but she was eyeballing me curiously now, making me grow nervous. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie, kiss me,&ldquo; I said quickly, tearing my eyes from Naomi&rsquo;s terrorising ones. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie, who was once distracted by the fireworks display, now tore her gaze from the sky and looked to me with raised eyebrows. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glanced at Naomi, seeing a smirk forming on her lips. All I kept thinking about were her words from yesterday, about catching me out. Wanting to prove a point and not raise any suspicion, I leaned forward and smacked my lips against Brie&rsquo;s, kissing her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was taken by surprise, but rested a hand on my waist as I moved my lips against hers. I caressed her cheek, moving closer to feel more comfortable. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pulled away after a moment, meeting Brie&rsquo;s eyes and subtly seeing if Naomi was staring still. She was glaring now, her smirk long gone as she turned away. I breathed out in relief and let go of Brie&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That was close,&ldquo; I got out, feeling a lot better, only to realise what I&rsquo;d done. I looked to Brie, eyes widening a little. \"Er, sorry. Everybody was kissing and Naomi saw that we weren&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t let her think otherwise&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie was still a little surprised, but nodded her head. She cleared her throat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, erm, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She awkwardly turned and looked back up to the sky, admiring the fireworks display. I did the same, moving back a little, suddenly feeling heat radiating between us. My lips were still tingling a little and I realised maybe I wanted to kiss her again. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was a <i>really </i>good kisser.</p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You okay?&ldquo; I asked Brie as she was finishing wiping the last of her makeup off in the bathroom mirror. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yeah, why?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shrugged, jumping into the bed. &ldquo;I dunno.

It&rsquo;s not weird. I literally agreed to this.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I nodded. &ldquo;I know, but I just thought&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m fine,&ldquo; she said, smiling at me in the mirror. \"You&rsquo;re just seeing things.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded and watched as she finished wiping her makeup off. She hasn&rsquo;t said much after I kissed her earlier and I was worried I&rsquo;d upset her or something. But maybe she was right and I was just seeing into things. I mean, it was just a kiss, right? It didn&rsquo;t mean anything to her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it might have meant something to me.</p>",
