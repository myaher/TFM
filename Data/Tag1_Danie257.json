The box count when we first took inventory was 16 and the furniture count was seven. Is that correct?\u201d The man named Anthony asked. You furrowed your eyebrows before laughing quietly.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure\u2026 That sounds accurate enough.\u201d You replied with a shrug. Anthony gave a small smile before walking over to the back of the truck. He placed a key in the lock, but you stopped paying attention to him after you heard a bark. You turned your head to look at Steven and saw him holding open the passenger seat door. Your eyes widened, and you knelt with a large smile as you realized what was happening. Your dog (D/n) was currently bolting towards you at scale breaking speeds.</p><p>She barked happily and catapulted herself into your arms. Your face became wet with dog saliva as she kissed you feverishly. Sure, it was gross, but you were too enthralled to see her again to care. You laughed and wrapped your arms around her neck. She was barking loudly in your ear as you sighed.</p><p>\u201cGod, I missed you girl.\u201d You whispered. (D/n) continued barking happily as a response.</p><p>You pulled away and stood up, rubbing the fur on top of her head as you did. You looked over your shoulder and saw that Phil was already beginning to move boxes from the truck to your apartment. You cleared your throat and began to quiet (D/n) down. You walked inside and into the kitchen, making sure she was following.</p><p>\u201cAlright girl. I need you to sit and stay. Heavy stuff is being moved and I don\u2019t want you to get hurt, okay?\u00a0<i>Stay</i>.\u201d You said. She followed your directions and sat down on the wooden floor. You smiled and walked away, looking over your shoulder to make sure she had listened to the second part of your instructions. Phil stood up from the box he had just set down and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to her like she understands you.\u201d He said with a small laugh. You shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it feels like she\u2019s the only one who can.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u3010\ufeff\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude31\u3011 \n\n<br/></p><p>You watched as Phil and the workers set the last piece of furniture down. You checked your watch and sighed.\u00a0<i>5:04.\u00a0</i>The sun was hanging low in the sky and the clouds were drifting serenely by. Phil stood straight and groaned, laying his hands on his lower back.<br/></p><p>\u201cJesus, this is one of the things I do\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0miss about moving.\u201d He said with a laugh. You gave a small smile before shaking your head and looking to the movers.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d You said. Anthony nodded.</p><p>\u201cAlright, have a good rest of the day ma\u2019am.\u201d He replied. You nodded and smiled, holding open the door for him. Steven followed in suit and got in the passenger seat as Anthony got in the drivers. You gave a small wave before shutting the door and sighing.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got everything in the house. Now we need to get everything out of boxes.\u201d You said. Phil sighed and sank down onto your couch.</p><p>\u201cPhysical\u2026 Activity\u2026 Not my strong suit.\u201d He replied. You laughed and sat next to him.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d You mumbled. You heard a bark come from your kitchen before you laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. I forget. Come here (D/n).\u201d You called. (D/n) came bounding towards you, her paws slipping on the polished wood. You laughed as she jumped onto the couch, kissing your face once again.</p><p>\u201cHeel, girl.<i>\u00a0Heel</i>.\u201d You said. She pulled away and let her tongue lull out of her mouth. You sighed and began to wipe her slobber off your face.</p><p>\u201cPhil, this is my dog (D/n), (D/n) this is Phil. Be nice.\u201d You said, ushering to each one as you said their names. (D/n) turned her body and looked at Phil. She gave a quiet bark that made Phil smile.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t bite, right?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. She might wanna smell you before letting you pet her though. Just to build trust you know.\u201d You answered. Phil nodded before holding out his hand. (D/n) pushed her nose into his palm, sniffing gingerly. It took her about 30 seconds before she was nudging the top of her head into his hand, begging for his attention. Phil smiled before moving his hand and scratching the top of her head and behind her ears.</p><p>\u201cSo (D/n), how\u2019d you come to that name?\u201d He asked, looking up at you. You scrunched your face before laughing.</p><p>\u201cGosh, it was so long ago I barely even remember. Let\u2019s see. I think I was just shuffling through names, you know? I said, like, 30 before I said (D/n) and she turned her head to me and I guess I just knew? That probably sounds cheesy.\u201d You replied. Phil smiled before shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I get it. Sometimes things are just meant to be. She\u2019s\u2026 11 now, right?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. As of three months ago.\u201d You answered. (D/n) laid her head on Phil\u2019s lap, rolling around so she could get comfortable.</p><p>\u201cYikes. Maybe wearing black pants today\u00a0<i>wasn\u2019t</i>\u00a0the best idea.\u201d He said, looking down at his now fur-covered jeans. You laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Perhaps not.\u201d You replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always admired huskies. They\u2019re such beautiful dogs.\u201d He said. You smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey really are. They\u2019ve been my favorite dog since\u2026 Gosh, forever I think. Took me forever to convince my mom though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made her finally budge?\u201d Phil asked. You frowned.</p><p>\u201cEh\u2026 She wanted to give me something that would motivate me to get out of bed, I guess you could say.\u201d You replied. Phil had could tell from your facial expressions and body language that this was a touchy subject. He knew better than to pry.</p><p>\u201cI see. Your mom. I forget her name.\u201d He said, trying to change the subject.</p><p>\u201c(Mo/n). And your dad\u2026 Well, my dad too but\u2026 His name is Michael, right?\u201d You asked. Phil nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He-\u201c Phil was cut off by his phone ringing. He pulled out his phone before laughing.</p><p>\u201cDan again.\u201d He said. You nodded.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Phil asked as he picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cOh, no worries. What are you in the mood for?\u201d He asked. You heard the other line buzz.</p><p>\u201cWell, my sister cooks. I can ask if she could make us something.\u201d He said. You raised your eyebrows.\u00a0<i>How did he know you cooked?</i></p><p>\u201cNonsense Dan. Look, I\u2019m already asking her. My roommate Dan wants to know if you\u2019ll cook us dinner. He said he\u2019s craving something homemade.\u201d Phil said. You laughed before shaking your head.</p><p>\u201cI mean, sure. How did you know I cooked though?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYour videos.\u201d He replied.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That makes sense.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cShe already said yes Dan. You\u2019ll be forced to interact now. What kind of homemade meal are you thinking?\u201d Phil asked. There was a pause before he began talking again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask. Do you know how to make ravioli?\u201d Phil asked you. You nodded.</p><p>\u201cAlright. He\u2019s gonna stop by the store so what stuff do you need?\u201d He asked. You bit your lip in thought.</p><p>\u201cFlour, salt, eggs, water, ground beef, ground veal, butter, a clove of garlic, spinach, parsley, Romano cheese, and nutmeg.\u201d You replied. Phil blinked for a second before clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll message you everything we need.\u201d He said into the phone. You laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cAlright, see you later. Bye.\u201d He said. You gave a small smile.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll be meeting Dan a little sooner than I anticipated.\u201d</p>",

The box count when we first took inventory was 16 and the furniture count was seven. Is that correct?\u201d The man named Anthony asked. You furrowed your eyebrows before laughing quietly.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure\u2026 That sounds accurate enough.\u201d You replied with a shrug. Anthony gave a small smile before walking over to the back of the truck. He placed a key in the lock, but you stopped paying attention to him after you heard a bark. You turned your head to look at Steven and saw him holding open the passenger seat door. Your eyes widened, and you knelt with a large smile as you realized what was happening. Your dog (D/n) was currently bolting towards you at scale breaking speeds.</p><p>She barked happily and catapulted herself into your arms. Your face became wet with dog saliva as she kissed you feverishly. Sure, it was gross, but you were too enthralled to see her again to care. You laughed and wrapped your arms around her neck. She was barking loudly in your ear as you sighed.</p><p>\u201cGod, I missed you girl.\u201d You whispered. (D/n) continued barking happily as a response.</p><p>You pulled away and stood up, rubbing the fur on top of her head as you did. You looked over your shoulder and saw that Phil was already beginning to move boxes from the truck to your apartment. You cleared your throat and began to quiet (D/n) down. You walked inside and into the kitchen, making sure she was following.</p><p>\u201cAlright girl. I need you to sit and stay. Heavy stuff is being moved and I don\u2019t want you to get hurt, okay?\u00a0<i>Stay</i>.\u201d You said. She followed your directions and sat down on the wooden floor. You smiled and walked away, looking over your shoulder to make sure she had listened to the second part of your instructions. Phil stood up from the box he had just set down and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to her like she understands you.\u201d He said with a small laugh. You shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it feels like she\u2019s the only one who can.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u3010\ufeff\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude31\u3011 \n\n<br></p><p>You watched as Phil and the workers set the last piece of furniture down. You checked your watch and sighed.\u00a0<i>5:04.\u00a0</i>The sun was hanging low in the sky and the clouds were drifting serenely by. Phil stood straight and groaned, laying his hands on his lower back.<br></p><p>\u201cJesus, this is one of the things I do\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0miss about moving.\u201d He said with a laugh. You gave a small smile before shaking your head and looking to the movers.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d You said. Anthony nodded.</p><p>\u201cAlright, have a good rest of the day ma\u2019am.\u201d He replied. You nodded and smiled, holding open the door for him. Steven followed in suit and got in the passenger seat as Anthony got in the drivers. You gave a small wave before shutting the door and sighing.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got everything in the house. Now we need to get everything out of boxes.\u201d You said. Phil sighed and sank down onto your couch.</p><p>\u201cPhysical\u2026 Activity\u2026 Not my strong suit.\u201d He replied. You laughed and sat next to him.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d You mumbled. You heard a bark come from your kitchen before you laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. I forget. Come here (D/n).\u201d You called. (D/n) came bounding towards you, her paws slipping on the polished wood. You laughed as she jumped onto the couch, kissing your face once again.</p><p>\u201cHeel, girl.<i>\u00a0Heel</i>.\u201d You said. She pulled away and let her tongue lull out of her mouth. You sighed and began to wipe her slobber off your face.</p><p>\u201cPhil, this is my dog (D/n), (D/n) this is Phil. Be nice.\u201d You said, ushering to each one as you said their names. (D/n) turned her body and looked at Phil. She gave a quiet bark that made Phil smile.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t bite, right?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. She might wanna smell you before letting you pet her though. Just to build trust you know.\u201d You answered. Phil nodded before holding out his hand. (D/n) pushed her nose into his palm, sniffing gingerly. It took her about 30 seconds before she was nudging the top of her head into his hand, begging for his attention. Phil smiled before moving his hand and scratching the top of her head and behind her ears.</p><p>\u201cSo (D/n), how\u2019d you come to that name?\u201d He asked, looking up at you. You scrunched your face before laughing.</p><p>\u201cGosh, it was so long ago I barely even remember. Let\u2019s see. I think I was just shuffling through names, you know? I said, like, 30 before I said (D/n) and she turned her head to me and I guess I just knew? That probably sounds cheesy.\u201d You replied. Phil smiled before shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I get it. Sometimes things are just meant to be. She\u2019s\u2026 11 now, right?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. As of three months ago.\u201d You answered. (D/n) laid her head on Phil\u2019s lap, rolling around so she could get comfortable.</p><p>\u201cYikes. Maybe wearing black pants today\u00a0<i>wasn\u2019t</i>\u00a0the best idea.\u201d He said, looking down at his now fur-covered jeans. You laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Perhaps not.\u201d You replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always admired huskies. They\u2019re such beautiful dogs.\u201d He said. You smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey really are. They\u2019ve been my favorite dog since\u2026 Gosh, forever I think. Took me forever to convince my mom though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made her finally budge?\u201d Phil asked. You frowned.</p><p>\u201cEh\u2026 She wanted to give me something that would motivate me to get out of bed, I guess you could say.\u201d You replied. Phil had could tell from your facial expressions and body language that this was a touchy subject. He knew better than to pry.</p><p>\u201cI see. Your mom. I forget her name.\u201d He said, trying to change the subject.</p><p>\u201c(Mo/n). And your dad\u2026 Well, my dad too but\u2026 His name is Michael, right?\u201d You asked. Phil nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He-\u201c Phil was cut off by his phone ringing. He pulled out his phone before laughing.</p><p>\u201cDan again.\u201d He said. You nodded.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Phil asked as he picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cOh, no worries. What are you in the mood for?\u201d He asked. You heard the other line buzz.</p><p>\u201cWell, my sister cooks. I can ask if she could make us something.\u201d He said. You raised your eyebrows.\u00a0<i>How did he know you cooked?</i></p><p>\u201cNonsense Dan. Look, I\u2019m already asking her. My roommate Dan wants to know if you\u2019ll cook us dinner. He said he\u2019s craving something homemade.\u201d Phil said. You laughed before shaking your head.</p><p>\u201cI mean, sure. How did you know I cooked though?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYour videos.\u201d He replied.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That makes sense.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cShe already said yes Dan. You\u2019ll be forced to interact now. What kind of homemade meal are you thinking?\u201d Phil asked. There was a pause before he began talking again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask. Do you know how to make ravioli?\u201d Phil asked you. You nodded.</p><p>\u201cAlright. He\u2019s gonna stop by the store so what stuff do you need?\u201d He asked. You bit your lip in thought.</p><p>\u201cFlour, salt, eggs, water, ground beef, ground veal, butter, a clove of garlic, spinach, parsley, Romano cheese, and nutmeg.\u201d You replied. Phil blinked for a second before clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll message you everything we need.\u201d He said into the phone. You laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cAlright, see you later. Bye.\u201d He said. You gave a small smile.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll be meeting Dan a little sooner than I anticipated.\u201d</p></p>",

You gave a small smile before shaking your head and looking to the movers.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d You said. Anthony nodded.</p><p>\u201cAlright, have a good rest of the day ma\u2019am.\u201d He replied. You nodded and smiled, holding open the door for him.

You gave a small wave before shutting the door and sighing.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got everything in the house. Now we need to get everything out of boxes.\u201d You said. Phil sighed and sank down onto your couch.</p><p>\u201cPhysical\u2026 Activity\u2026 Not my strong suit.\u201d He replied. You laughed and sat next to him.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d You mumbled. You heard a bark come from your kitchen before you laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. I forget. Come here (D/n).\u201d You called. (D/n) came bounding towards you, her paws slipping on the polished wood. You laughed as she jumped onto the couch, kissing your face once again.</p><p>\u201cHeel, girl.<i>\u00a0Heel</i>.\u201d You said. She pulled away and let her tongue lull out of her mouth. You sighed and began to wipe her slobber off your face.</p><p>\u201cPhil, this is my dog (D/n), (D/n) this is Phil. Be nice.\u201d You said, ushering to each one as you said their names. (D/n) turned her body and looked at Phil. She gave a quiet bark that made Phil smile.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t bite, right?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. She might wanna smell you before letting you pet her though. Just to build trust you know.\u201d You answered. Phil nodded before holding out his hand. (D/n) pushed her nose into his palm, sniffing gingerly. It took her about 30 seconds before she was nudging the top of her head into his hand, begging for his attention. Phil smiled before moving his hand and scratching the top of her head and behind her ears.</p><p>\u201cSo (D/n), how\u2019d you come to that name?\u201d He asked, looking up at you. You scrunched your face before laughing.</p><p>\u201cGosh, it was so long ago I barely even remember. Let\u2019s see. I think I was just shuffling through names, you know? I said, like, 30 before I said (D/n) and she turned her head to me and I guess I just knew? That probably sounds cheesy.\u201d You replied. Phil smiled before shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I get it. Sometimes things are just meant to be. She\u2019s\u2026 11 now, right?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. As of three months ago.\u201d You answered. (D/n) laid her head on Phil\u2019s lap, rolling around so she could get comfortable.</p><p>\u201cYikes. Maybe wearing black pants today\u00a0<i>wasn\u2019t</i>\u00a0the best idea.\u201d He said, looking down at his now fur-covered jeans. You laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Perhaps not.\u201d You replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always admired huskies. They\u2019re such beautiful dogs.\u201d He said. You smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey really are. They\u2019ve been my favorite dog since\u2026 Gosh, forever I think. Took me forever to convince my mom though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made her finally budge?\u201d Phil asked. You frowned.</p><p>\u201cEh\u2026 She wanted to give me something that would motivate me to get out of bed, I guess you could say.\u201d You replied. Phil had could tell from your facial expressions and body language that this was a touchy subject. He knew better than to pry.</p><p>\u201cI see. Your mom. I forget her name.\u201d He said, trying to change the subject.</p><p>\u201c(Mo/n). And your dad\u2026 Well, my dad too but\u2026 His name is Michael, right?\u201d You asked. Phil nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He-\u201c Phil was cut off by his phone ringing. He pulled out his phone before laughing.</p><p>\u201cDan again.\u201d He said. You nodded.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Phil asked as he picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cOh, no worries. What are you in the mood for?\u201d He asked. You heard the other line buzz.</p><p>\u201cWell, my sister cooks. I can ask if she could make us something.\u201d He said. You raised your eyebrows.\u00a0<i>How did he know you cooked?</i></p><p>\u201cNonsense Dan. Look, I\u2019m already asking her. My roommate Dan wants to know if you\u2019ll cook us dinner. He said he\u2019s craving something homemade.\u201d Phil said. You laughed before shaking your head.</p><p>\u201cI mean, sure. How did you know I cooked though?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYour videos.\u201d He replied.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That makes sense.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cShe already said yes Dan. You\u2019ll be forced to interact now. What kind of homemade meal are you thinking?\u201d Phil asked. There was a pause before he began talking again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask. Do you know how to make ravioli?\u201d Phil asked you. You nodded.</p><p>\u201cAlright. He\u2019s gonna stop by the store so what stuff do you need?\u201d He asked. You bit your lip in thought.</p><p>\u201cFlour, salt, eggs, water, ground beef, ground veal, butter, a clove of garlic, spinach, parsley, Romano cheese, and nutmeg.\u201d You replied. Phil blinked for a second before clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll message you everything we need.\u201d He said into the phone. You laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cAlright, see you later. Bye.\u201d He said. You gave a small smile.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll be meeting Dan a little sooner than I anticipated.\u201d</p></p>",

Perhaps not.&rdquo; You replied.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always admired huskies. They&rsquo;re such beautiful dogs.&rdquo; He said. You smiled and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;They really are. They&rsquo;ve been my favorite dog since&hellip; Gosh, forever I think. Took me forever to convince my mom though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What made her finally budge?&rdquo; Phil asked. You frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; She wanted to give me something that would motivate me to get out of bed, I guess you could say.&rdquo; You replied. Phil had could tell from your facial expressions and body language that this was a touchy subject. He knew better than to pry.</p><p>&ldquo;I see. Your mom. I forget her name.&rdquo; He said, trying to change the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;(Mo/n). And your dad&hellip; Well, my dad too but&hellip; His name is Michael, right?&rdquo; You asked. Phil nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. He-&ldquo; Phil was cut off by his phone ringing. He pulled out his phone before laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan again.&rdquo; He said. You nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Phil asked as he picked up the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no worries. What are you in the mood for?&rdquo; He asked. You heard the other line buzz.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, my sister cooks. I can ask if she could make us something.&rdquo; He said. You raised your eyebrows.&nbsp;<i>How did he know you cooked?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense Dan. Look, I&rsquo;m already asking her. My roommate Dan wants to know if you&rsquo;ll cook us dinner. He said he&rsquo;s craving something homemade.&rdquo; Phil said. You laughed before shaking your head.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, sure. How did you know I cooked though?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Your videos.&rdquo; He replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. That makes sense.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;She already said yes Dan. You&rsquo;ll be forced to interact now. What kind of homemade meal are you thinking?&rdquo; Phil asked. There was a pause before he began talking again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask. Do you know how to make ravioli?&rdquo; Phil asked you. You nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. He&rsquo;s gonna stop by the store so what stuff do you need?&rdquo; He asked. You bit your lip in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Flour, salt, eggs, water, ground beef, ground veal, butter, a clove of garlic, spinach, parsley, Romano cheese, and nutmeg.&rdquo; You replied. Phil blinked for a second before clearing his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll message you everything we need.&rdquo; He said into the phone. You laughed quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, see you later. Bye.&rdquo; He said. You gave a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;ll be meeting Dan a little sooner than I anticipated.&rdquo;</p></p>",

He would only speak to Kate and Eric, whose medication had been adjusted and he seemed to be doing much better, and even when he talked to them it was just whispering.

Of course, she wanted to help the other man and if helping him went along with helping Phil then great, but she was not going to go out of her way to help.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>Lela jingled the door handle making sure it was locked so they wouldn&rsquo;t have a repeat of last time.</p><p>\u201cOk, Danny do you remember what we discussed a few days ago?\u201d She questioned him as she sat down at her desk.</p><p>Dan shook his head no. Sighing, she reminded him that they were going to be doing something he didn\u2019t like but they were things that could help his daddy.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d</p><p>Still not looking her in the eyes and clutching his bear to his chest he nodded his head yes.</p><p>\u201cOk great Danny! Let\u2019s get started. I want you to lay down and get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Without saying a word, Dan obeyed her request.</p><p>Lela took him through the process of being put under hypnosis again and once she was satisfied he was completely under, she began.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan I want you to remember the cabin.\u201d</p><p>Lela was met with silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the cabin that Sir\u2019s took you to Danny?\u201d she tried again.</p><p>Dan whimpered and breathed out a pained, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good Dan now tell me what do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain; lots of pain,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of pain Dan? Can you explain it to me?\u201d she pushed.</p><p>Whimpering again, \u201cAll over, it hurts all over.\u201d</p><p>Lela quickly jotted down a few notes in her journal before returning her attention back to Dan.</p><p>\u201cDan I need you to be more specific what kind of pain are you referring to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir&hellip;couldn\u2019t move&hellip; other Sir\u2026 pain in bum,\u201d he moaned.</p><p>Lela wrote that down. The police had already confirmed Dan was raped the first time while in captivity but the fact he was remembering was a good thing.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan that\u2019s very good. Can you tell me anything else you remember?\u201d</p><p>The boy whimpered again, \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok Dan, let\u2019s move on.\u201d she jotted some more stuff down and accidentally knocked the glass of water she had sitting on her desk down.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d she swore desperately trying to save the papers on her desk from being ruined. The water poured off the desk making the carpet soaked.</p><p>But she was pulled from her thoughts and stopped what she was doing instantly when she heard Dan scream.</p><p>\u201cStop! It hurts! Please!\u201d he sobbed.</p><p>She sprung into action, \u201cWhat hurts Dan? Stop what?\u201d</p><p>Dan did respond instead his body started to violently convulse. Not sure what was going on or what to do she attempted to bring the boy out of his hypnotic state.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan when I get to three you will no longer be there but instead back in my office in the hospital. Ok?\u201d She\u2019s not even sure why she asked knowing he wasn\u2019t going to respond.</p><p>\u201cOne\u2026\u201d Dan momentarily stopped convulsing to start back up only seconds later \u201ctwo&hellip;three.\u201d</p><p>The moment she hit three everything stopped and the room went quiet.</p><p>\u201cDanny are you alright?\u201d she questioned hesitantly putting her hand on his knee. Dan\u2019s eyelids fluttered open. \u201cLela?\u201d he slurred out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Lela was shocked, this most definitely was not the voice she had become accustomed to over the last few months.</p><p>\u201cD&hellip;Da&hellip;Dan is that you?\u201d she stammered.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes were unfocused and foggy but he managed to pull himself up into a seated position.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. Who else would it be?\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Lela knew she had to proceed carefully. \u201cDan, do you remember anything from the last few weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m in the hospital right?\u201d</p><p>Lela shook her head to confirm.</p><p>\u201cAnd&hellip;and Phil was here yesterday, right?\u201d he asked uncertainty.</p><p>So Dan didn\u2019t remember anything from the last few weeks, including the trial. The last time Phil had visited, was around a month and a half, nearly two months ago.</p><p>\u201cDan I\u2019m so sorry, that was over a month ago, and a lot has happened during that time.\u201d</p><p>Confusion clouded his eyes, \u201cWhat do you mean? I want to talk to Phil, he\u2019ll explain what&rsquo;s going on.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He stood up and started walking to the door, \u201cDan I\u2019m sorry I have to be the one to tell you this. But you can\u2019t call Phil and you most definitely can\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><p>Fear was evident on his face, \u201cWhy? What happened? Is he alright?\u201d he asked panicking.</p><p>\u201cDan, Phil\u2019s fine. Well, as fine as he can be for being in prison.\u201d</p><p>Dan stopped dead in his tracks and whispered, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Lela sighed Dan I\u2019m so sorry Phil was tried and found guilty of your kidnapping and torture and -\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he screamed his jaw and fists clenched together.</p><p>\u201cDan I know this isn\u2019t what you wanted to hear, but I need you to calm down.\u201d She said trying to reason with him.</p><p>\u201cCalm down! Calm down! You think I\u2019m going to calm down when my innocent boyfriend is sitting in prison!?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan-\u201d She was cut off by Dan picking up a little figuring she had on her desk and threw it, smashing it to the floor.</p><p>Lela flinched, \u201cDan I need you to stop or I\u2019m going to have to call the nurses and they will have no choice but to sedate you.\u201d</p><p>Dan fell to the floor. \u201cThis is fucking ridiculous,\u201d he sobbed into his hands.</p><p>Positive he was done throwing things, Lela got down onto the floor next to him and pulled him into a hug.</p><p>He wailed and sobbed into her shoulder, drenching her jumper with his tears repeating the same thing over and over, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not fair Dan, but I had to call the police on him. I just didn\u2019t think it would end up like this.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s body went rigid. Pulling back he glared at her with hatred, \u201cYou fucking did this?\u201d</p><p>Startled Lela shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Dan I had too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d he screeched as he flung himself away from her.</p><p>\u201cDan I really didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen.\u201d she pleaded with him.</p><p>Dan tried to open the door to escape the room, but the door wouldn\u2019t open, remembering she had locked it before the session.</p><p>Frustrated he started pounding on the door as hard as he could with his fists, new tears streaming down his face. He fell to the floor sobbing, \u201cI want my daddy!\u201d clearing having regressed again. He sobbed into his hands as her door opened from the outside. There stood a nurse, needle in hand and ready to strike.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked. His eyes fell to Lela sitting on the floor as well as Dan and his bloodied fists.</p><p>He was moments away from injection when Lela screamed, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d the nurse pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the doctor here? I said no!\u201d She flung herself over to Dan and let him sob into her clothing again.</p><p>\u201cI got this under control, I just need help getting him to his room.\u201d</p><p>The nurse looked anything but happy but he obliged and carried Dan back to his room, with Lela following close behind.</p><p>He set his now quiet figure on to the bed. From the somewhat peaceful look on his face, Lela thought he must be asleep.</p><p>She sighed, leaving Dan to sleep it off and she went to write her report, now being able to add water as a trigger.</p>",

Is he alright?\u201d he asked panicking.</p><p>\u201cDan, Phil\u2019s fine. Well, as fine as he can be for being in prison.\u201d</p><p>Dan stopped dead in his tracks and whispered, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Lela sighed Dan I\u2019m so sorry Phil was tried and found guilty of your kidnapping and torture and -\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he screamed his jaw and fists clenched together.</p><p>\u201cDan I know this isn\u2019t what you wanted to hear, but I need you to calm down.\u201d She said trying to reason with him.</p><p>\u201cCalm down! Calm down! You think I\u2019m going to calm down when my innocent boyfriend is sitting in prison!?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan-\u201d She was cut off by Dan picking up a little figuring she had on her desk and threw it, smashing it to the floor.</p><p>Lela flinched, \u201cDan I need you to stop or I\u2019m going to have to call the nurses and they will have no choice but to sedate you.\u201d</p><p>Dan fell to the floor. \u201cThis is fucking ridiculous,\u201d he sobbed into his hands.</p><p>Positive he was done throwing things, Lela got down onto the floor next to him and pulled him into a hug.</p><p>He wailed and sobbed into her shoulder, drenching her jumper with his tears repeating the same thing over and over, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not fair Dan, but I had to call the police on him. I just didn\u2019t think it would end up like this.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s body went rigid. Pulling back he glared at her with hatred, \u201cYou fucking did this?\u201d</p><p>Startled Lela shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Dan I had too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d he screeched as he flung himself away from her.</p><p>\u201cDan I really didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen.\u201d she pleaded with him.</p><p>Dan tried to open the door to escape the room, but the door wouldn\u2019t open, remembering she had locked it before the session.</p><p>Frustrated he started pounding on the door as hard as he could with his fists, new tears streaming down his face. He fell to the floor sobbing, \u201cI want my daddy!\u201d clearing having regressed again. He sobbed into his hands as her door opened from the outside. There stood a nurse, needle in hand and ready to strike.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked. His eyes fell to Lela sitting on the floor as well as Dan and his bloodied fists.</p><p>He was moments away from injection when Lela screamed, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d the nurse pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the doctor here? I said no!\u201d She flung herself over to Dan and let him sob into her clothing again.</p><p>\u201cI got this under control, I just need help getting him to his room.\u201d</p><p>The nurse looked anything but happy but he obliged and carried Dan back to his room, with Lela following close behind.</p><p>He set his now quiet figure on to the bed. From the somewhat peaceful look on his face, Lela thought he must be asleep.</p><p>She sighed, leaving Dan to sleep it off and she went to write her report, now being able to add water as a trigger.</p>",

He would only speak to Kate and Eric, whose medication had been adjusted and he seemed to be doing much better, and even when he talked to them it was just whispering. He would refuse to share during group therapy spending the entire time clutching Pooh bear to his chest looking down at his feet, which were resting on the edge of the chair, with a vacant expression in his eyes.</p><p>A few days after the incident, Lela had received an alarming phone call from Phil. She had no idea how he had been able to make a phone call to the hospital as she figured the prison would bar any contact between the two men.</p><p>The call had been quick but she could tell from his voice Phil was not doing well. She had to keep reminding herself that Phil was not her patient and her sole focus needed to be on Dan. Of course, she wanted to help the other man and if helping him went along with helping Phil then great, but she was not going to go out of her way to help.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>Lela jingled the door handle making sure it was locked so they wouldn\u2019t have a repeat of last time.</p><p>\u201cOk, Danny do you remember what we discussed a few days ago?\u201d She questioned him as she sat down at her desk.</p><p>Dan shook his head no. Sighing, she reminded him that they were going to be doing something he didn\u2019t like but they were things that could help his daddy.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d</p><p>Still not looking her in the eyes and clutching his bear to his chest he nodded his head yes.</p><p>\u201cOk great Danny! Let\u2019s get started. I want you to lay down and get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Without saying a word, Dan obeyed her request.</p><p>Lela took him through the process of being put under hypnosis again and once she was satisfied he was completely under, she began.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan I want you to remember the cabin.\u201d</p><p>Lela was met with silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the cabin that Sir\u2019s took you to Danny?\u201d she tried again.</p><p>Dan whimpered and breathed out a pained, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good Dan now tell me what do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain; lots of pain,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of pain Dan? Can you explain it to me?\u201d she pushed.</p><p>Whimpering again, \u201cAll over, it hurts all over.\u201d</p><p>Lela quickly jotted down a few notes in her journal before returning her attention back to Dan.</p><p>\u201cDan I need you to be more specific what kind of pain are you referring to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir\u2026couldn\u2019t move\u2026 other Sir\u2026 pain in bum,\u201d he moaned.</p><p>Lela wrote that down. The police had already confirmed Dan was raped the first time while in captivity but the fact he was remembering was a good thing.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan that\u2019s very good. Can you tell me anything else you remember?\u201d</p><p>The boy whimpered again, \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok Dan, let\u2019s move on.\u201d she jotted some more stuff down and accidentally knocked the glass of water she had sitting on her desk down.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d she swore desperately trying to save the papers on her desk from being ruined. The water poured off the desk making the carpet soaked.</p><p>But she was pulled from her thoughts and stopped what she was doing instantly when she heard Dan scream.</p><p>\u201cStop! It hurts! Please!\u201d he sobbed.</p><p>She sprung into action, \u201cWhat hurts Dan? Stop what?\u201d</p><p>Dan did respond instead his body started to violently convulse. Not sure what was going on or what to do she attempted to bring the boy out of his hypnotic state.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan when I get to three you will no longer be there but instead back in my office in the hospital. Ok?\u201d She\u2019s not even sure why she asked knowing he wasn\u2019t going to respond.</p><p>\u201cOne\u2026\u201d Dan momentarily stopped convulsing to start back up only seconds later \u201ctwo\u2026three.\u201d</p><p>The moment she hit three everything stopped and the room went quiet.</p><p>\u201cDanny are you alright?\u201d she questioned hesitantly putting her hand on his knee. Dan\u2019s eyelids fluttered open. \u201cLela?\u201d he slurred out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Lela was shocked, this most definitely was not the voice she had become accustomed to over the last few months.</p><p>\u201cD\u2026Da\u2026Dan is that you?\u201d she stammered.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes were unfocused and foggy but he managed to pull himself up into a seated position.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. Who else would it be?\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Lela knew she had to proceed carefully. \u201cDan, do you remember anything from the last few weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m in the hospital right?\u201d</p><p>Lela shook her head to confirm.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026and Phil was here yesterday, right?\u201d he asked uncertainty.</p><p>So Dan didn\u2019t remember anything from the last few weeks, including the trial. The last time Phil had visited, was around a month and a half, nearly two months ago.</p><p>\u201cDan I\u2019m so sorry, that was over a month ago, and a lot has happened during that time.\u201d</p><p>Confusion clouded his eyes, \u201cWhat do you mean? I want to talk to Phil, he\u2019ll explain what\u2019s going on.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He stood up and started walking to the door, \u201cDan I\u2019m sorry I have to be the one to tell you this. But you can\u2019t call Phil and you most definitely can\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><p>Fear was evident on his face, \u201cWhy? What happened? Is he alright?\u201d he asked panicking.</p><p>\u201cDan, Phil\u2019s fine. Well, as fine as he can be for being in prison.\u201d</p><p>Dan stopped dead in his tracks and whispered, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Lela sighed Dan I\u2019m so sorry Phil was tried and found guilty of your kidnapping and torture and -\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he screamed his jaw and fists clenched together.</p><p>\u201cDan I know this isn\u2019t what you wanted to hear, but I need you to calm down.\u201d She said trying to reason with him.</p><p>\u201cCalm down! Calm down! You think I\u2019m going to calm down when my innocent boyfriend is sitting in prison!?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan-\u201d She was cut off by Dan picking up a little figuring she had on her desk and threw it, smashing it to the floor.</p><p>Lela flinched, \u201cDan I need you to stop or I\u2019m going to have to call the nurses and they will have no choice but to sedate you.\u201d</p><p>Dan fell to the floor. \u201cThis is fucking ridiculous,\u201d he sobbed into his hands.</p><p>Positive he was done throwing things, Lela got down onto the floor next to him and pulled him into a hug.</p><p>He wailed and sobbed into her shoulder, drenching her jumper with his tears repeating the same thing over and over, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not fair Dan, but I had to call the police on him.

Well, as fine as he can be for being in prison.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stopped dead in his tracks and whispered, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Lela sighed Dan I&rsquo;m so sorry Phil was tried and found guilty of your kidnapping and torture and -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you fucking kidding me?&rdquo; he screamed his jaw and fists clenched together.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan I know this isn&rsquo;t what you wanted to hear, but I need you to calm down.&rdquo; She said trying to reason with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down! Calm down! You think I&rsquo;m going to calm down when my innocent boyfriend is sitting in prison!?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan-&rdquo; She was cut off by Dan picking up a little figuring she had on her desk and threw it, smashing it to the floor.</p><p>Lela flinched, &ldquo;Dan I need you to stop or I&rsquo;m going to have to call the nurses and they will have no choice but to sedate you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan fell to the floor. &ldquo;This is fucking ridiculous,&rdquo; he sobbed into his hands.</p><p>Positive he was done throwing things, Lela got down onto the floor next to him and pulled him into a hug.</p><p>He wailed and sobbed into her shoulder, drenching her jumper with his tears repeating the same thing over and over, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not fair Dan, but I had to call the police on him. I just didn&rsquo;t think it would end up like this.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s body went rigid. Pulling back he glared at her with hatred, &ldquo;You fucking did this?&rdquo;</p><p>Startled Lela shook her head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Dan I had too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You bitch!&rdquo; he screeched as he flung himself away from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan I really didn&rsquo;t mean for any of this to happen.&rdquo; she pleaded with him.</p><p>Dan tried to open the door to escape the room, but the door wouldn&rsquo;t open, remembering she had locked it before the session.</p><p>Frustrated he started pounding on the door as hard as he could with his fists, new tears streaming down his face. He fell to the floor sobbing, &ldquo;I want my daddy!&rdquo; clearing having regressed again. He sobbed into his hands as her door opened from the outside. There stood a nurse, needle in hand and ready to strike.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he asked. His eyes fell to Lela sitting on the floor as well as Dan and his bloodied fists.</p><p>He was moments away from injection when Lela screamed, &ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo; the nurse pleaded.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the doctor here? I said no!&rdquo; She flung herself over to Dan and let him sob into her clothing again.</p><p>&ldquo;I got this under control, I just need help getting him to his room.&rdquo;</p><p>The nurse looked anything but happy but he obliged and carried Dan back to his room, with Lela following close behind.</p><p>He set his now quiet figure on to the bed. From the somewhat peaceful look on his face, Lela thought he must be asleep.</p><p>She sighed, leaving Dan to sleep it off and she went to write her report, now being able to add water as a trigger.</p>",
