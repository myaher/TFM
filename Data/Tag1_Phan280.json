But that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg - with an unsteady future, undiagnosed mental illness, and suddenly thrust into the public eye, 2012 was a tumultuous year, one that no one has yet to truly understand.</p><p><b>Chapter: </b>2 - <i>February</i></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2.2k</p><p><b>Relationship: </b>Dan Howell/Phil Lester</p><p><b>Rating: </b>E</p><p><b>Chapter Warnings: </b>n/a</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15992774/chapters/37489847\">Read on AO3</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15992774/chapters/37311836\">January</a></i></p></blockquote><p><b>2/6/2012 \u2013 8:27 PM</b></p><p>Today was a good day, at least it ought to be. They had uploaded the first episode of the Super Amazing Project\u2019s second season, after all. Phil, for one, was thrilled to see all their hard work pay off in a video he was proud of.</p><p>Dan was just\u2026tired.</p><p>And Phil could understand it, he supposed. They had exerted more mental and physical energy than they otherwise would for a video, even more so considering how important the premiere was to them. But Dan looked like he had the wind taken out of his sails, like his soul departed from his body and only a zombie of himself remained. He watched the younger male sit on the couch with bowed shoulders, seemingly unable to keep focus. Phil frowned, sitting down by his side and gently resting his hand between his shoulder blades. \u201cHey, do you want some tea? Maybe go take a bath?\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cJust wanna sleep,\u201d he answered, squeezing his eyes shut and opening them wide. \u201cIt\u2019ll fuck up my internal clock, though.\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cGoing to sleep around nine might not be such a bad thing. You might wake up before noon, go out and have a productive morning,\u201d he offered with a slight laugh.</p><p>Dan appeared to be listening, but not actually hearing anything. He stood up slowly \u2013 even in his exhausted state he was aware of the physical consequences of pushing himself up too fast. \u201cGonna shower,\u201d he decided, silently shuffling from the lounge to the bathroom.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Phil got up and tailed after him \u2013 which at the snail\u2019s pace Dan was moving at, was not very difficult. \u201cYou\u2019re so tired, I don\u2019t want you to fall and hurt yourself. I really think you should just take a bath instead\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>fine</i>,\u201d Dan insisted, annoyance in his tone. Despite Phil\u2019s protests, he closed the door to the bathroom, and the sound of water running could be heard from the outside.</p><p>Luckily, that night did not end in tragedy. Dan had been in bed by ten but had still ended up sleeping well into the next day. Phil, however, was up much later, preoccupied with worry.</p><p><b>2/14/12 \u2013 3:54 PM</b></p><p>What had started out as a lovely holiday had gone sour rapidly. The morning was great \u2013 a long pancake breakfast in front of the tv, calm, pleasant conversation, an exchange of homemade cards because \u2013 despite everything \u2013 they couldn\u2019t resist being cheesy. All was well.</p><p>Then Phil suggested going out for dinner, and all hell broke loose.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your fucking <i>mind</i>?\u201d it looked like a blood vessel could pop at any moment. \u201cWe can\u2019t go <i>out</i> on Valentine\u2019s Day. Everyone is out on a fucking date. Do you know how easily we could be spotted? How much it would blow up if we were?\u201d Dan shook his head, getting up and pacing around. \u201cWe have more eyes on us than ever before. You got recognized <i>twice</i> getting cereal from fucking Tesco\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>Phil was taken aback, but quickly went from being hurt at the refusal to angry at the overreaction. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem? Yeah, okay, we might be recognized if we go out. Are we supposed to stay inside for the rest of our lives? Am I supposed to act like I barely know you if we go out together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so selfish?\u201d Dan snapped. \u201cCan\u2019t you stop thinking about what you want now long enough to think about what it could mean for our future?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> being selfish? You\u2019re the one that\u2019s so caught up in how strangers on the internet see you that you\u2019ve stopped giving a shit about anyone else\u2019s feelings!\u201d Phil gritted his teeth. \u201cI should be allowed to express how I feel about you without having to look over my shoulder every minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go upload another video about it?\u201d and with that, Dan stormed off and slammed the door to his room.</p><p><b>12/15/12 \u2013 2:33 AM</b></p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d Dan knocked on the door, voice meek. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>There was silence, but just before he was about to retreat into his room, he heard a gruff \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Dan sheepishly padded into Phil\u2019s bedroom and sat down at the edge of the bed. He stared at the floor without speaking for another moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I took out a lot of stress and anger out on you before and totally ruined Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d he sighed, fidgeting with the hem of his t-shirt. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to forgive me. I just wanted you to know that I know I was a dick.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled weakly, sitting up and reaching out to take Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cIt was a dick move, but you\u2019re not a dick,\u201d he told him. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have pushed for going out anyway, we\u2019d have to wait at least an hour anywhere we went,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I can\u2019t let you take any fault for this. <i>I</i> fucked up,\u201d Dan insisted, then paused for a moment. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be doing this right now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if now is the right time to be in an exclusive relationship. We have so much going on with videos and conventions, worrying about \u2018us\u2019 is just another thing that\u2019ll stress us out,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Phil frowned, letting go of Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you breaking up with me?\u201d he held one of his pillows to his chest, trying to ignore the feeling that his world was crashing down around him.</p><p>\u201cNo, not exactly,\u201d Dan got up and started to walk back and forth as he searched for his words. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that until we get more settled, until we don\u2019t have so much on our plates, we should just\u2026take a break from being a couple. That way we won\u2019t have to worry about hiding this big secret from our audience.\u201d</p><p>Silence refilled the room as Phil mulled over what Dan said. As much as he hated the idea of not being with him, he couldn\u2019t argue his points. Dan had seemed so on edge, on the brink of breaking. Maybe he was right, maybe a relationship was just an additional thing they needed to juggle in their increasingly busy lives. \u201cI guess you have a point. Besides, everyone likes the dynamic we have as friends. It could work like that,\u201d he didn\u2019t seem to fully believe his own words, but was willing to try.</p><p>\u201cSee, I knew you\u2019d get it,\u201d he smiled, seeming to relax. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be all the stronger for it,\u201d he walked over and squeezed his shoulder. \u201cThank you for being so understanding.\u201d</p><p>Phil pat his hand and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot. Now get to sleep, it\u2019s late,\u201d he told him before laying down and rolling over. He listened to his door open and close, and for Dan\u2019s door to do the same. He buried his face in his pillow and let out a frustrated sob, tears dropping from his eyes and to the pillowcase. As much as he suspected this would happen, and that it may even be for the best, he couldn\u2019t stop the hurt he felt.</p><p><b>2/25/12 \u2013 12:47 PM</b></p><p>Phil stood with his phone in his hand, brows furrowed. \u201cI still think this is a stupid idea,\u201d he mumbled, but continued typing away.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, it could be fun,\u201d Dan retorted. \u201cBesides, if nothing else, we can get some funny stories out of it,\u201d he held up his phone, showing Phil his camera roll. \u201cWhich one should be the profile picture? I want something that says, \u2018puts effort into his appearance without trying too hard\u2019,\u201d he hummed.</p><p>Not enough time had passed for this, Phil felt. It hadn\u2019t even been two weeks since their unofficial breakup and there they were, making dating profiles on OkCupid. He had been opposed to the idea from the beginning, but Dan had been insistent that it was a good idea. Phil relented, deciding that just because he downloaded the app didn\u2019t mean he had to go on a bunch of dates, though he winced at the idea of Dan doing so. \u201cI like the third one in the second row,\u201d he told him with a shrug, before returning to his own profile. He liked the personality quizzes, if nothing else. \u201cOkay, I think I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up and grinned. \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so bad. You\u2019ll be spammed with inappropriate messages in no time,\u201d he teased. \u201cGood thing most of our viewers are under eighteen, that\u2019d make things so much worse,\u201d he chuckled, scrolling through recommended profiles.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d like your ego stroked a little bit,\u201d Phil retorted, shoving his phone into his pocket and getting up from the couch. \u201cDo we have food?\u201d he asked as he made his way into the kitchen and began rifling through the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cShould have some leftover Indian takeaway,\u201d Dan shrugged, attention more on the messages he was starting to receive. As far as he was concerned, this was an obvious solution \u2013 they could date and sleep around, get their needs fulfilled, and keep making videos and have the appearance of normal best friends. Besides, Phil had so much more to offer in a relationship \u2013 he doubted he\u2019d even need him after a while. \u201cSave some for me, though. I don\u2019t feel like cooking.\u201d</p><p>Phil heated up a plate of food in the microwave. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty left,\u201d he assured. When his food was ready, he went and set at the table to eat. He scrolled aimlessly through OkCupid profiles as he ate, then tapped on Dan\u2019s profile when he stumbled upon it. They were a 99% match, go figure.</p><p><b>2/29/12 \u2013 3:08 AM</b></p><p>Phil was a light sleeper. It was never more than a minor inconvenience growing up, though it made for some unpleasant nights at university. Sometimes it led him to scold Dan for staying up until four in the morning, because he could hear him playing video games through the wall. Though tonight, he would have much preferred it was video games.</p><p>Instead, he heard Dan having sex with the guy he\u2019d brought back to the flat about an hour before. He found it ironic, in a way, that the first person he hooked up with from the website was a man, considering he had been so preoccupied with coming off as \u2018gay\u2019 to his audience. The noises were muffled, leading Phil to believe he was trying to be quiet by hiding his face in the pillow \u2013 a courtesy he appreciated.</p><p>Phil tossed and turned as he tried to get himself back to sleep, but he was far too distracted by what was going on in the next room. He got up, rifling through his nightstand for earplugs, putting them in and laying back down. With the sounds drowning out, he let himself drift back off to sleep.</p><p>When the morning came, the man was gone, and Dan was sitting at the table, eating breakfast like nothing had happened. Phil had expected that they would start seeing other people eventually, but he wasn\u2019t ready for it to be so soon. He sure as hell wasn\u2019t ready to bring home a one-night stand, and almost resented Dan for jumping in bed with someone else.</p><p>\u201cHave fun last night?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>Dan blushed, looking down at his bowl of cereal. \u201cYou uh\u2026were awake? I was trying to be discreet,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cThin walls, Dan. I was a little surprised, is all,\u201d Phil was doing his damnedest to seem unaffected. The last thing he wanted was to come off as jealous or needy \u2013 he was a grown man, he wasn\u2019t supposed to cling to someone that clearly wanted space.</p><p>\u201cJust needed a distraction. You don\u2019t have to think when you\u2019re running on endorphins,\u201d Dan explained. Apart from Phil, he had always found it easy to detach emotions from sex. To him, sex was an activity that could be used to relieve stress, the same way someone would go for a run or smoke weed \u2013 both things he had tried and quickly decided he was not a fan of.</p><p>Phil shrugged, helping himself to a bowl of Dan\u2019s cereal. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re not bothered by it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t really matter now does it? This is what you wanted, and I\u2019m a big boy, I\u2019ll cope just fine,\u201d Phil\u2019s tone was a bit harsher than he intended, so he tried to offset it. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just jealous that it\u2019s so easy for you to score,\u201d he joked.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019d be easy for you too if you weren\u2019t so picky. It\u2019s just sex \u2013 find someone hot and put your penis in them,\u201d it may have come off as a bit odd for him to be so insistent on Phil seeing other people as well, but deep down he knew he was trying to alleviate his conscience of guilt for putting them in that situation in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so appealing,\u201d Phil laughed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try lowering my standards a little bit,\u201d it could be fun, he thought. He was overdue for a bit of fun.</p><p>And when he did get an attractive stranger in his bed that night, he felt satisfied in the moment \u2013 it was good sex. But falling asleep alone made him question if it was worth it.</p>",

I really think you should just take a bath instead\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>fine</i>,\u201d Dan insisted, annoyance in his tone. Despite Phil\u2019s protests, he closed the door to the bathroom, and the sound of water running could be heard from the outside.</p><p>Luckily, that night did not end in tragedy. Dan had been in bed by ten but had still ended up sleeping well into the next day. Phil, however, was up much later, preoccupied with worry.</p><p><b>2/14/12 \u2013 3:54 PM</b></p><p>What had started out as a lovely holiday had gone sour rapidly. The morning was great \u2013 a long pancake breakfast in front of the tv, calm, pleasant conversation, an exchange of homemade cards because \u2013 despite everything \u2013 they couldn\u2019t resist being cheesy. All was well.</p><p>Then Phil suggested going out for dinner, and all hell broke loose.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your fucking <i>mind</i>?\u201d it looked like a blood vessel could pop at any moment. \u201cWe can\u2019t go <i>out</i> on Valentine\u2019s Day. Everyone is out on a fucking date. Do you know how easily we could be spotted? How much it would blow up if we were?\u201d Dan shook his head, getting up and pacing around. \u201cWe have more eyes on us than ever before. You got recognized <i>twice</i> getting cereal from fucking Tesco\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>Phil was taken aback, but quickly went from being hurt at the refusal to angry at the overreaction. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem? Yeah, okay, we might be recognized if we go out. Are we supposed to stay inside for the rest of our lives? Am I supposed to act like I barely know you if we go out together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so selfish?\u201d Dan snapped. \u201cCan\u2019t you stop thinking about what you want now long enough to think about what it could mean for our future?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> being selfish? You\u2019re the one that\u2019s so caught up in how strangers on the internet see you that you\u2019ve stopped giving a shit about anyone else\u2019s feelings!\u201d Phil gritted his teeth. \u201cI should be allowed to express how I feel about you without having to look over my shoulder every minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go upload another video about it?\u201d and with that, Dan stormed off and slammed the door to his room.</p><p><b>12/15/12 \u2013 2:33 AM</b></p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d Dan knocked on the door, voice meek. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>There was silence, but just before he was about to retreat into his room, he heard a gruff \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Dan sheepishly padded into Phil\u2019s bedroom and sat down at the edge of the bed.

They had uploaded the first episode of the Super Amazing Project\u2019s second season, after all. Phil, for one, was thrilled to see all their hard work pay off in a video he was proud of.</p><p>Dan was just\u2026tired.</p><p>And Phil could understand it, he supposed. They had exerted more mental and physical energy than they otherwise would for a video, even more so considering how important the premiere was to them. But Dan looked like he had the wind taken out of his sails, like his soul departed from his body and only a zombie of himself remained. He watched the younger male sit on the couch with bowed shoulders, seemingly unable to keep focus. Phil frowned, sitting down by his side and gently resting his hand between his shoulder blades. \u201cHey, do you want some tea? Maybe go take a bath?\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cJust wanna sleep,\u201d he answered, squeezing his eyes shut and opening them wide. \u201cIt\u2019ll fuck up my internal clock, though.\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cGoing to sleep around nine might not be such a bad thing. You might wake up before noon, go out and have a productive morning,\u201d he offered with a slight laugh.</p><p>Dan appeared to be listening, but not actually hearing anything. He stood up slowly \u2013 even in his exhausted state he was aware of the physical consequences of pushing himself up too fast. \u201cGonna shower,\u201d he decided, silently shuffling from the lounge to the bathroom.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Phil got up and tailed after him \u2013 which at the snail\u2019s pace Dan was moving at, was not very difficult. \u201cYou\u2019re so tired, I don\u2019t want you to fall and hurt yourself. I really think you should just take a bath instead\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>fine</i>,\u201d Dan insisted, annoyance in his tone. Despite Phil\u2019s protests, he closed the door to the bathroom, and the sound of water running could be heard from the outside.</p><p>Luckily, that night did not end in tragedy. Dan had been in bed by ten but had still ended up sleeping well into the next day. Phil, however, was up much later, preoccupied with worry.</p><p><b>2/14/12 \u2013 3:54 PM</b></p><p>What had started out as a lovely holiday had gone sour rapidly. The morning was great \u2013 a long pancake breakfast in front of the tv, calm, pleasant conversation, an exchange of homemade cards because \u2013 despite everything \u2013 they couldn\u2019t resist being cheesy. All was well.</p><p>Then Phil suggested going out for dinner, and all hell broke loose.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your fucking <i>mind</i>?\u201d it looked like a blood vessel could pop at any moment. \u201cWe can\u2019t go <i>out</i> on Valentine\u2019s Day. Everyone is out on a fucking date. Do you know how easily we could be spotted? How much it would blow up if we were?\u201d Dan shook his head, getting up and pacing around. \u201cWe have more eyes on us than ever before. You got recognized <i>twice</i> getting cereal from fucking Tesco\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>Phil was taken aback, but quickly went from being hurt at the refusal to angry at the overreaction. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem? Yeah, okay, we might be recognized if we go out. Are we supposed to stay inside for the rest of our lives? Am I supposed to act like I barely know you if we go out together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so selfish?\u201d Dan snapped. \u201cCan\u2019t you stop thinking about what you want now long enough to think about what it could mean for our future?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> being selfish? You\u2019re the one that\u2019s so caught up in how strangers on the internet see you that you\u2019ve stopped giving a shit about anyone else\u2019s feelings!\u201d Phil gritted his teeth. \u201cI should be allowed to express how I feel about you without having to look over my shoulder every minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go upload another video about it?\u201d and with that, Dan stormed off and slammed the door to his room.</p><p><b>12/15/12 \u2013 2:33 AM</b></p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d Dan knocked on the door, voice meek. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>There was silence, but just before he was about to retreat into his room, he heard a gruff \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Dan sheepishly padded into Phil\u2019s bedroom and sat down at the edge of the bed. He stared at the floor without speaking for another moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I took out a lot of stress and anger out on you before and totally ruined Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d he sighed, fidgeting with the hem of his t-shirt. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to forgive me. I just wanted you to know that I know I was a dick.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled weakly, sitting up and reaching out to take Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cIt was a dick move, but you\u2019re not a dick,\u201d he told him. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have pushed for going out anyway, we\u2019d have to wait at least an hour anywhere we went,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I can\u2019t let you take any fault for this. <i>I</i> fucked up,\u201d Dan insisted, then paused for a moment. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be doing this right now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if now is the right time to be in an exclusive relationship. We have so much going on with videos and conventions, worrying about \u2018us\u2019 is just another thing that\u2019ll stress us out,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Phil frowned, letting go of Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you breaking up with me?\u201d he held one of his pillows to his chest, trying to ignore the feeling that his world was crashing down around him.</p><p>\u201cNo, not exactly,\u201d Dan got up and started to walk back and forth as he searched for his words. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that until we get more settled, until we don\u2019t have so much on our plates, we should just\u2026take a break from being a couple. That way we won\u2019t have to worry about hiding this big secret from our audience.\u201d</p><p>Silence refilled the room as Phil mulled over what Dan said. As much as he hated the idea of not being with him, he couldn\u2019t argue his points. Dan had seemed so on edge, on the brink of breaking. Maybe he was right, maybe a relationship was just an additional thing they needed to juggle in their increasingly busy lives. \u201cI guess you have a point. Besides, everyone likes the dynamic we have as friends. It could work like that,\u201d he didn\u2019t seem to fully believe his own words, but was willing to try.</p><p>\u201cSee, I knew you\u2019d get it,\u201d he smiled, seeming to relax. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be all the stronger for it,\u201d he walked over and squeezed his shoulder. \u201cThank you for being so understanding.\u201d</p><p>Phil pat his hand and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot. Now get to sleep, it\u2019s late,\u201d he told him before laying down and rolling over. He listened to his door open and close, and for Dan\u2019s door to do the same. He buried his face in his pillow and let out a frustrated sob, tears dropping from his eyes and to the pillowcase. As much as he suspected this would happen, and that it may even be for the best, he couldn\u2019t stop the hurt he felt.</p><p><b>2/25/12 \u2013 12:47 PM</b></p><p>Phil stood with his phone in his hand, brows furrowed. \u201cI still think this is a stupid idea,\u201d he mumbled, but continued typing away.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, it could be fun,\u201d Dan retorted. \u201cBesides, if nothing else, we can get some funny stories out of it,\u201d he held up his phone, showing Phil his camera roll. \u201cWhich one should be the profile picture? I want something that says, \u2018puts effort into his appearance without trying too hard\u2019,\u201d he hummed.</p><p>Not enough time had passed for this, Phil felt. It hadn\u2019t even been two weeks since their unofficial breakup and there they were, making dating profiles on OkCupid. He had been opposed to the idea from the beginning, but Dan had been insistent that it was a good idea. Phil relented, deciding that just because he downloaded the app didn\u2019t mean he had to go on a bunch of dates, though he winced at the idea of Dan doing so. \u201cI like the third one in the second row,\u201d he told him with a shrug, before returning to his own profile. He liked the personality quizzes, if nothing else. \u201cOkay, I think I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up and grinned. \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so bad. You\u2019ll be spammed with inappropriate messages in no time,\u201d he teased. \u201cGood thing most of our viewers are under eighteen, that\u2019d make things so much worse,\u201d he chuckled, scrolling through recommended profiles.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d like your ego stroked a little bit,\u201d Phil retorted, shoving his phone into his pocket and getting up from the couch. \u201cDo we have food?\u201d he asked as he made his way into the kitchen and began rifling through the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cShould have some leftover Indian takeaway,\u201d Dan shrugged, attention more on the messages he was starting to receive. As far as he was concerned, this was an obvious solution \u2013 they could date and sleep around, get their needs fulfilled, and keep making videos and have the appearance of normal best friends. Besides, Phil had so much more to offer in a relationship \u2013 he doubted he\u2019d even need him after a while. \u201cSave some for me, though. I don\u2019t feel like cooking.\u201d</p><p>Phil heated up a plate of food in the microwave. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty left,\u201d he assured. When his food was ready, he went and set at the table to eat. He scrolled aimlessly through OkCupid profiles as he ate, then tapped on Dan\u2019s profile when he stumbled upon it. They were a 99% match, go figure.</p><p><b>2/29/12 \u2013 3:08 AM</b></p><p>Phil was a light sleeper. It was never more than a minor inconvenience growing up, though it made for some unpleasant nights at university. Sometimes it led him to scold Dan for staying up until four in the morning, because he could hear him playing video games through the wall. Though tonight, he would have much preferred it was video games.</p><p>Instead, he heard Dan having sex with the guy he\u2019d brought back to the flat about an hour before. He found it ironic, in a way, that the first person he hooked up with from the website was a man, considering he had been so preoccupied with coming off as \u2018gay\u2019 to his audience. The noises were muffled, leading Phil to believe he was trying to be quiet by hiding his face in the pillow \u2013 a courtesy he appreciated.</p><p>Phil tossed and turned as he tried to get himself back to sleep, but he was far too distracted by what was going on in the next room. He got up, rifling through his nightstand for earplugs, putting them in and laying back down. With the sounds drowning out, he let himself drift back off to sleep.</p><p>When the morning came, the man was gone, and Dan was sitting at the table, eating breakfast like nothing had happened. Phil had expected that they would start seeing other people eventually, but he wasn\u2019t ready for it to be so soon. He sure as hell wasn\u2019t ready to bring home a one-night stand, and almost resented Dan for jumping in bed with someone else.</p><p>\u201cHave fun last night?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>Dan blushed, looking down at his bowl of cereal. \u201cYou uh\u2026were awake? I was trying to be discreet,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cThin walls, Dan. I was a little surprised, is all,\u201d Phil was doing his damnedest to seem unaffected. The last thing he wanted was to come off as jealous or needy \u2013 he was a grown man, he wasn\u2019t supposed to cling to someone that clearly wanted space.</p><p>\u201cJust needed a distraction. You don\u2019t have to think when you\u2019re running on endorphins,\u201d Dan explained. Apart from Phil, he had always found it easy to detach emotions from sex. To him, sex was an activity that could be used to relieve stress, the same way someone would go for a run or smoke weed \u2013 both things he had tried and quickly decided he was not a fan of.</p><p>Phil shrugged, helping himself to a bowl of Dan\u2019s cereal. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re not bothered by it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t really matter now does it? This is what you wanted, and I\u2019m a big boy, I\u2019ll cope just fine,\u201d Phil\u2019s tone was a bit harsher than he intended, so he tried to offset it. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just jealous that it\u2019s so easy for you to score,\u201d he joked.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019d be easy for you too if you weren\u2019t so picky. It\u2019s just sex \u2013 find someone hot and put your penis in them,\u201d it may have come off as a bit odd for him to be so insistent on Phil seeing other people as well, but deep down he knew he was trying to alleviate his conscience of guilt for putting them in that situation in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so appealing,\u201d Phil laughed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try lowering my standards a little bit,\u201d it could be fun, he thought. He was overdue for a bit of fun.</p><p>And when he did get an attractive stranger in his bed that night, he felt satisfied in the moment \u2013 it was good sex. But falling asleep alone made him question if it was worth it.</p></p>",

I can&rsquo;t let you take any fault for this. <i>I</i> fucked up,&rdquo; Dan insisted, then paused for a moment. &ldquo;Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this right now&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if now is the right time to be in an exclusive relationship. We have so much going on with videos and conventions, worrying about &lsquo;us&rsquo; is just another thing that&rsquo;ll stress us out,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p>Phil frowned, letting go of Dan&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Are you breaking up with me?&rdquo; he held one of his pillows to his chest, trying to ignore the feeling that his world was crashing down around him.</p><p>&ldquo;No, not exactly,&rdquo; Dan got up and started to walk back and forth as he searched for his words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying that until we get more settled, until we don&rsquo;t have so much on our plates, we should just&hellip;take a break from being a couple. That way we won&rsquo;t have to worry about hiding this big secret from our audience.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence refilled the room as Phil mulled over what Dan said. As much as he hated the idea of not being with him, he couldn&rsquo;t argue his points. Dan had seemed so on edge, on the brink of breaking. Maybe he was right, maybe a relationship was just an additional thing they needed to juggle in their increasingly busy lives. &ldquo;I guess you have a point. Besides, everyone likes the dynamic we have as friends. It could work like that,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t seem to fully believe his own words, but was willing to try.</p><p>&ldquo;See, I knew you&rsquo;d get it,&rdquo; he smiled, seeming to relax. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll be all the stronger for it,&rdquo; he walked over and squeezed his shoulder. &ldquo;Thank you for being so understanding.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil pat his hand and nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth a shot. Now get to sleep, it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; he told him before laying down and rolling over. He listened to his door open and close, and for Dan&rsquo;s door to do the same. He buried his face in his pillow and let out a frustrated sob, tears dropping from his eyes and to the pillowcase. As much as he suspected this would happen, and that it may even be for the best, he couldn&rsquo;t stop the hurt he felt.</p><p><b>2/25/12 &ndash; 12:47 PM</b></p><p>Phil stood with his phone in his hand, brows furrowed. &ldquo;I still think this is a stupid idea,&rdquo; he mumbled, but continued typing away.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, it could be fun,&rdquo; Dan retorted. &ldquo;Besides, if nothing else, we can get some funny stories out of it,&rdquo; he held up his phone, showing Phil his camera roll. &ldquo;Which one should be the profile picture? I want something that says, &lsquo;puts effort into his appearance without trying too hard&rsquo;,&rdquo; he hummed.</p><p>Not enough time had passed for this, Phil felt. It hadn&rsquo;t even been two weeks since their unofficial breakup and there they were, making dating profiles on OkCupid. He had been opposed to the idea from the beginning, but Dan had been insistent that it was a good idea. Phil relented, deciding that just because he downloaded the app didn&rsquo;t mean he had to go on a bunch of dates, though he winced at the idea of Dan doing so. &ldquo;I like the third one in the second row,&rdquo; he told him with a shrug, before returning to his own profile. He liked the personality quizzes, if nothing else. &ldquo;Okay, I think I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looked up and grinned. &ldquo;See? That wasn&rsquo;t so bad. You&rsquo;ll be spammed with inappropriate messages in no time,&rdquo; he teased. &ldquo;Good thing most of our viewers are under eighteen, that&rsquo;d make things so much worse,&rdquo; he chuckled, scrolling through recommended profiles.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d like your ego stroked a little bit,&rdquo; Phil retorted, shoving his phone into his pocket and getting up from the couch. &ldquo;Do we have food?&rdquo; he asked as he made his way into the kitchen and began rifling through the refrigerator.</p><p>&ldquo;Should have some leftover Indian takeaway,&rdquo; Dan shrugged, attention more on the messages he was starting to receive. As far as he was concerned, this was an obvious solution &ndash; they could date and sleep around, get their needs fulfilled, and keep making videos and have the appearance of normal best friends. Besides, Phil had so much more to offer in a relationship &ndash; he doubted he&rsquo;d even need him after a while. &ldquo;Save some for me, though. I don&rsquo;t feel like cooking.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil heated up a plate of food in the microwave. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty left,&rdquo; he assured. When his food was ready, he went and set at the table to eat. He scrolled aimlessly through OkCupid profiles as he ate, then tapped on Dan&rsquo;s profile when he stumbled upon it. They were a 99% match, go figure.</p><p><b>2/29/12 &ndash; 3:08 AM</b></p><p>Phil was a light sleeper. It was never more than a minor inconvenience growing up, though it made for some unpleasant nights at university. Sometimes it led him to scold Dan for staying up until four in the morning, because he could hear him playing video games through the wall. Though tonight, he would have much preferred it was video games.</p><p>Instead, he heard Dan having sex with the guy he&rsquo;d brought back to the flat about an hour before. He found it ironic, in a way, that the first person he hooked up with from the website was a man, considering he had been so preoccupied with coming off as &lsquo;gay&rsquo; to his audience. The noises were muffled, leading Phil to believe he was trying to be quiet by hiding his face in the pillow &ndash; a courtesy he appreciated.</p><p>Phil tossed and turned as he tried to get himself back to sleep, but he was far too distracted by what was going on in the next room. He got up, rifling through his nightstand for earplugs, putting them in and laying back down. With the sounds drowning out, he let himself drift back off to sleep.</p><p>When the morning came, the man was gone, and Dan was sitting at the table, eating breakfast like nothing had happened. Phil had expected that they would start seeing other people eventually, but he wasn&rsquo;t ready for it to be so soon. He sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t ready to bring home a one-night stand, and almost resented Dan for jumping in bed with someone else.</p><p>&ldquo;Have fun last night?&rdquo; he asked dryly.</p><p>Dan blushed, looking down at his bowl of cereal. &ldquo;You uh&hellip;were awake? I was trying to be discreet,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thin walls, Dan. I was a little surprised, is all,&rdquo; Phil was doing his damnedest to seem unaffected. The last thing he wanted was to come off as jealous or needy &ndash; he was a grown man, he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to cling to someone that clearly wanted space.</p><p>&ldquo;Just needed a distraction. You don&rsquo;t have to think when you&rsquo;re running on endorphins,&rdquo; Dan explained. Apart from Phil, he had always found it easy to detach emotions from sex. To him, sex was an activity that could be used to relieve stress, the same way someone would go for a run or smoke weed &ndash; both things he had tried and quickly decided he was not a fan of.</p><p>Phil shrugged, helping himself to a bowl of Dan&rsquo;s cereal. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to defend yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re not bothered by it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t really matter now does it? This is what you wanted, and I&rsquo;m a big boy, I&rsquo;ll cope just fine,&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s tone was a bit harsher than he intended, so he tried to offset it. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m just jealous that it&rsquo;s so easy for you to score,&rdquo; he joked.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be easy for you too if you weren&rsquo;t so picky. It&rsquo;s just sex &ndash; find someone hot and put your penis in them,&rdquo; it may have come off as a bit odd for him to be so insistent on Phil seeing other people as well, but deep down he knew he was trying to alleviate his conscience of guilt for putting them in that situation in the first place.</p><p>&ldquo;You make it sound so appealing,&rdquo; Phil laughed. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll try lowering my standards a little bit,&rdquo; it could be fun, he thought. He was overdue for a bit of fun.</p><p>And when he did get an attractive stranger in his bed that night, he felt satisfied in the moment &ndash; it was good sex. But falling asleep alone made him question if it was worth it.</p></p>",

They had uploaded the first episode of the Super Amazing Project&rsquo;s second season, after all. Phil, for one, was thrilled to see all their hard work pay off in a video he was proud of.</p>\n<p>Dan was just&hellip;tired.</p>\n<p>And Phil could understand it, he supposed. They had exerted more mental and physical energy than they otherwise would for a video, even more so considering how important the premiere was to them. But Dan looked like he had the wind taken out of his sails, like his soul departed from his body and only a zombie of himself remained. He watched the younger male sit on the couch with bowed shoulders, seemingly unable to keep focus. Phil frowned, sitting down by his side and gently resting his hand between his shoulder blades. &ldquo;Hey, do you want some tea? Maybe go take a bath?&rdquo; he offered.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just wanna sleep,&rdquo; he answered, squeezing his eyes shut and opening them wide. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll fuck up my internal clock, though.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Phil shrugged. &ldquo;Going to sleep around nine might not be such a bad thing. You might wake up before noon, go out and have a productive morning,&rdquo; he offered with a slight laugh.</p>\n<p>Dan appeared to be listening, but not actually hearing anything. He stood up slowly &ndash; even in his exhausted state he was aware of the physical consequences of pushing himself up too fast. &ldquo;Gonna shower,&rdquo; he decided, silently shuffling from the lounge to the bathroom.</p>\n</p>",

Anything is possible; we only get to see snippets of their lives \u2013 and they are snippets that dnp\u00a0<i>choose</i>\u00a0to share with us and control how the snippets are presented.\u00a0I think that\u2019s important to remember.</p><p>To roll with the idea that they are sleeping in separate rooms in India\u2026\u00a0idk about you, anon, but I\u2019m a massive introvert and sometimes I just need to <i>chill</i>\u00a0alone. Like, yes, I know that they say they introvert together, but I\u2019m sure when they are home they don\u2019t spend literally every waking second together the way that they do while touring \u2013 Dan\u2019s got his own office and they\u2019ve got multiple lounges ffs. Touring is so\u00a0<i>go go go </i>and I can imagine that getting <i>exhausting</i>. If I were in their shoes, no matter <i>how</i>\u00a0much I loved someone (whether it was my bff, brother, or partner), I would need some <i>goddamn space</i>\u00a0every now and then and fuck yeah, lemme have my own hotel room so I can stay up until 4am watching buzzfeed unsolved without bothering anyone.</p><p>And we know that they <i>are</i>\u00a0spending plenty of time together in India. We know they went out for drinks \u2013 and that Dan was sitting by Phil. We know they\u2019ve eaten together plenty \u2013 and that Phil picks food off of Dan\u2019s plate so he can try new things. We know that Dan knows Phil\u2019s Indian food order <i>by heart</i>\u00a0and knows that it\u2019s all he\u2019s ordered in ten years. And we know that Dan is <i>fine</i>\u00a0with Phil being safe with what he orders and Dan shares his riskier, more adventurous orders with Phil. To me, that\u2019s so cute, and that\u2019s <i>love.\u00a0</i></p><p>Lastly, I know nothing about the video game thing, but again, <i>introverting is important</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Although of course maybe I\u2019m totally wrong and Phil is madly in love with Marianne (<a href=\"http://auroraphilealis.tumblr.com/post/178234062203/hiii-so-i-saw-a-thing-on-twitter-which-for-some\" target=\"_blank\">context</a>).</p>",
