        "body": "<p>Controversial opinion, but Ron shouldn&rsquo;t have been a Prefect.</p><p>Neither should Harry, or even Hermione.</p><p>This is less because of some belief that \u201cNeville deserved the\nposition as a Prefect\u201d, and more because these three socially inept\nidiots are about as rule-abiding as Peeves.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like, a Prefect is supposed to work as an extension of the\nauthority and aid of a professor. Meaning that they&rsquo;re supposed to\nfollow the rules, and be generally highly regarded in their House as\nsomeone who could be turned to for aid.</p><p>Cedric Diggory and Percy Weasley are both excellent examples of\nPrefects.</p><p>Percy might be considered a bit too pompous and rule-abiding, but\nhe&rsquo;s friendly, hardworking, and always willing to help. With these\ntraits combined, he really is a fantastic pick for a Prefect.</p><p>Harry is a snarky little shit who spends nearly as much time in\ndetention as the twins, and has all the friendly charisma of a wet\ntowel. He&rsquo;s fiercely loyal to those he considers \u201chis\u201d, and in\ncase of danger he always steps up, but outside of that he&rsquo;ll sit and\nbrood by a windowsill like a particularly scrawny gargoyle. Friendly\nand approachable he isn&rsquo;t, and trying to get him to abide by rules he\ndisagrees with is basically impossible.</p><p>An excellent hero, and a good-hearted young man\nthrough-and-through. But a halfway-decent Prefect he&rsquo;s not.</p><p>In comparison, Ron sticks to Harry like glue, and if there&rsquo;s a\nfight in Hogwarts, then odds are pretty good that Ron threw the first\npunch. He&rsquo;s a good friend, and despite his terrible studying-habits,\nhe&rsquo;s not a bad student either. But whilst he&rsquo;s less likely to break a\nrule than Harry is, he doesn&rsquo;t particularly care if he has to break\nrules in order to punch someone whom he considers deserving of it,\nand he has a grand temper that flares up with a deceptively cutting\ntongue.</p><p>A kindhearted young man with a fondness for sports, who can be\nrelied upon to protect people in need, but who&rsquo;ll also casually\ndisregard rules that he doesn&rsquo;t care about and is about as likely to\npretend at spontaneous deafness as he is to actually help a younger\nstudent with studying. A good Prefect he really isn&rsquo;t.</p><p>As for Hermione, she&rsquo;s bossy and perfectly capable of following\nthe rules. She&rsquo;s also judgmental to the extreme, dangerously vicious\nto anyone she perceives as an enemy, and about as capable of dealing\nwith people as a cat dunked in a bucket of ice-water. She&rsquo;s very\npassionate about studying, but also very unlikely to offer to help\nsomeone else with their work, since they&rsquo;d undoubtedly slow her down.\nShe&rsquo;s unapproachable in her bossiness, she constantly hangs out with\ntwo of the biggest rule-breakers in the castle, she harps on about\nstudying to the extreme, and for all that she disapproves of\nrule-breaking she&rsquo;s clearly incapable of keeping either of her\nfriends in check.</p><p>A bright young woman with an excellent career ahead of her in\nanything other than dealing with other people. But whilst she might\nreact badly to seeing someone whom she considers vapid (as in, literally any other girl in the series, because Hermione is like that) elevated to\nthe position of Prefect, she herself is really not Prefect-material.</p><p><b>TL;DR: The trio are a lovely bunch of nutcases, but friendly and rule-abiding they ain\u2019t.</b></p><p><b></b><br/></p><p>(An argument could be made for Remus Lupin&rsquo;s stint as a Prefect\nhaving been a failed attempt to curtail the Marauders, hoping that\nthe \u201cnicest\u201d of them would be enough to stop the rest of the\ngroup, not counting on the fact that Remus is hopelessly bad at\nsaying no to people he likes.)</p><p>(James Potter seems like a bit of a long shot for a Prefect when\nRemus is demoted, until you realize that at this point Sirius has\ntried to murder someone, and Remus has shown himself as incapable of\nthe task, and Peter is widely known as a bit of a silly doormat. The\nfact that James takes the position seriously and becomes a good\nPrefect is mostly down to timing, and various personal realizations\nfrom his side of things.)</p>",

No, James has chocolate in his shirt pocket.\u201d Remus replied as he closed his eyes and breathed in the scent.</p><p>\u201cGive it to him, Prongs, or else he&rsquo;ll pout all night!\u201d Peter warned as he watched in amusement.</p><p>James still looked slightly confused, but handed Remus the chocolate. \u201cI swear you have no filter when it comes to chocolate. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in a trance or something.\u201d</p><p>Remus hummed in agreement, his mouth full of the delicious sweet. \u201cWho needs a filter when you have chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Mother says I need to wear a gag while at family get togethers. Apparently everything about me upsets the guests.\u201d Sirius said forlornly.</p><p>\u201cWell when I&rsquo;m around Evans, my very existence upsets her.\u201d James added, his brows furrowed in a frown. <b>\u201cI always need to be gagged.\u201d</b></p><p>All three boys looked at Peter who raised his brows in question. \u201cEveryone thinks I&rsquo;m adorable, no gag needed here.\u201d</p><p>James rolled his eyes but hopped off Sirius\u2019 bed and headed towards his own. \u201cWell apparently I need to sleep, Moony ate my late night snack.\u201d</p><p>Peter sighed, but followed suit, heading to his bed. \u201cWish we had more, I could use a snack.\u201d</p><p>Sirius smiled and stretched out leisurely in his bed. \u201cDon&rsquo;t you dare get up, Moony you&rsquo;re staying here tonight.\u201d</p><p>Remus smirked, while James and Peter both groaned. They were still adjusting to Remus and Sirius\u2019 relationship, the two having only gone public for a few days now. While the sleeping situation was new, Remus had always been close to Sirius and vice versa. The transition from friends to boyfriends went smoother than they&rsquo;d anticipated, the whole thing feeling natural.</p><p>\u201cWasn&rsquo;t planning on moving, but could you? You&rsquo;re literally in the middle of the bed.\u201d Remus said, his smile still in place.</p><p>Sirius huffed out a sigh, but moved nonetheless, an eager look on his face.
