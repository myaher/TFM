        "body": "<p><br/>It is important that you always learn about all options available to you. When you are dating, you want to test the waters with multiple partners to figure out what you are looking for, for example. The same goes for medical treatments, and learning about acupuncture today can help you feel better tomorrow.<br/><br/>It is important to let your acupuncturist know about the vitamins or medications you are taking before the beginning of your treatment. Some pills can affect your system and counteract the effects of an acupuncture session. You might have to stop taking your medication or vitamins for a while if you want to get good results from acupuncture.<br/><br/>When it comes to eating after having acupuncture done, make sure you eat healthy food. Eating a lot of unhealthy food after your session is just putting back the toxins that the acupuncture released. Try sticking with <a href=\"http://1800healthfitness.com/acupuncture-for-weight-loss.html\">Health</a>y and fresh vegetables, fruits, meats and other foods that are nourishing and good for you.<br/><br/>If you are nervous about acupuncture, and you are not sure if it is right for you, do not be afraid to ask questions. Believe it or not, one of the most common inquiries is whether or not the acupuncturist practices a painless style of treatment. Your fears may be eased when you hear some of the answers.<br/><br/>Look into your insurance coverage before choosing acupuncture. While more and more insurance plans are covering alternative medicine and methodologies, not all do. It&rsquo;s important for you to know what to expect financially so that you don&rsquo;t have a sticker shock after your initial treatment. Look at your plan, or call your insurance company if you&rsquo;re still unsure.<br/><br/>To protect your health, make sure that the acupuncture practitioner that you choose is certified by the health department in your state. Ask if they have been certified by the national board, completed the training program and passed any required exams. Also, find out how long they have been practicing.<br/><br/>Know what you&rsquo;re getting into. Acupuncture involves dealing with tiny needles. There is no way to get around that, so come to terms with it before you arrive for your first appointment. As an acupuncturist if they have any times for feeling more comfortable with needles, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry.<br/><br/>If you suffer with frequent migraine headaches and have yet to find relief, think about visiting a local acupuncture practice. Often times migraines are caused or exacerbated by stress and physical tension building up in your back and neck muscles. The acupuncture professional you visit should be able to alleviate some of this tension, providing you with some much needed relief.<br/><br/>During your first treatment, breathe and relax. This obviously is a treatment that involves needles. Your body may be tensing up in unexpected ways. Just do yourself a favor and breathe deep. Let go of your tensions, and trust in your acupuncturist to do the right things for you.<br/><br/>Be sure a particular acupuncturist takes your insurance. Acupuncture appointments can be rather expensive if you go often. If you plan to use acupuncture as part of your long-term health maintenance plan, you should make sure that your health insurance covers this type of treatment.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that your practitioner may place needles in places you find unusual. A needle on your scalp or between their eyes may be the best way for them to treat your problems. You should emotionally prepare yourself for this and remember that it won&rsquo;t be painful. That way, you won&rsquo;t panic when the time comes.<br/><br/>You now have a deeper understanding about acupuncture treatments and what they can do for you. You are primed and ready to step out and find yourself an acupuncturist. As soon as you do, you will feel absolutely awesome, but only if you keep your new knowledge in mind as you venture out.<br/></p>",

I plan on doing this by drinking a calorie bomb each morning to try and gain weight with no weight lifting. I feel that going to the gym just burns the calories when i&rsquo;m more worried about gaining weight right now rather than muscle. i want to know if this is okay, and if so, what kind of smoothies out there provide the most calories?</p> <br /><br />\nSubmitted December 07, 2018 at 03:34AM by LiveSketch<br />\nvia reddit <a href=\"https://ift.tt/2QBGgFr\" target=\"_blank\">https://ift.tt/2QBGgFr</a></p>",

In the second class, I got a little foggy during warmups, but I came back strong during the remainder of class.</p><p>A barre friend and I grabbed breakfast afterward and then we went back to the studio for ornament decorating with other ladies.</p><p><b>Sunday</b> was a rest day.</p><p><b>Monday</b> was pure reform and I felt much stronger compared to Saturday\u2019s attempt.</p><p><b>Tuesday</b> was a doozy. I went for a two-mile lunch run. On my way back to the office, I saw three people walking on the double-wide sidewalk and they were going in the same direction I was. I was running probably a 10:30 pace and tried going around them (they had made a wall). They had previously passed me when they were running earlier so they knew I was coming. Right when I rounded around them and got a few feet ahead, I heard a <b><span class=\"npf_color_ross\">crash</span></b>. </p><p>I turn around and there was a cyclist on the ground in a pile of rocks. At first I thought it was a child, but no, it was an older man, angrily pointing at me. The three people walked over to help him and he hopped on his bike. I walked back to them and he sped off. I asked if it was my fault and they said there was no way. He should\u2019ve said \u201con your left\u201d or something when he passed. One person said they heard him ring his bell once, but it was faint. I had my headphones in, but I was listening to a podcast low enough that I had been able to hear runners pass by me earlier.</p><p>Essentially he was trying to pass four people, that he probably had seen for a while. Poor planning on his part. I told some coworkers and they said he was probably going at a higher speed thinking he could edge pass us quickly. </p><p>So that was awkward. Selfishly I was glad that when all that happened I had just hit two miles. I walked with those three people for a while, just to be safe. </p><p>That evening I had barre class and my thighs struggled.</p><p><b>Wednesday</b> I got off early for our division holiday party, so I saved my run for after work. It wasn\u2019t a pretty one by any means, but it happened. Then, I went to an earlier barre class. </p><p><b>Thursday</b> I went to a 6 a.m. barre class with my former morning crew and my favorite instructor who I never get to take any more. (She mainly does morning or day classes.) It was REALLY good.</p><p><b>Today</b> is a rest day. I had driven to visit family yesterday and I\u2019m headed back today. </p><p>Tomorrow will be at least one barre class. Possibly a run will get thrown in this weekend. </p>",
