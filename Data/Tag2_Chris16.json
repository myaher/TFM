drool practically seeping\nfrom your lips at the sight of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d you breathed out softly. \u00a0Chris stuffed his hands into his front\npockets, a lop sided grin on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d \u00a0You were\nunsure of what to even say, and it seemed the same for Chris. \u00a0You were able to read him like an open book\nas a look of guilt popped onto his beautiful face. \u00a0\u201cHow have you been?\u201d \u00a0he asked with a slight nervous tinge to his\nvoice. \u00a0</p><p>You shrugged, looking down at your feet. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been ok.\u201d \u00a0Looking back into his eyes, you just wanted\nto scream and kiss him at the same time. \n\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes met yours; a hint of sadness behind them. \u00a0\u201cUmm, yeah I\u2019ve been good. \u00a0Working a lot so that\u2019s kept me pretty busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d was all you managed to say with a raise of your\nbrows. \u00a0Of course he was \u2018so\u2019 busy that\nhe couldn\u2019t even bother to text or call you back after so many years. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook Jess\u2026\u201d he began to say when the door to the balcony\nopened. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Jess, you wanna play another round of beer pong and be\non my team this time?\u201d Chace asked with a smile. \u00a0Your own relieved smile spread across your\nface. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d you replied. \nLooking back to Chris, you gave him a tight smile. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you around.\u201d \u00a0It nearly broke your heart to be so short\nwith your responses to him; but he broke your heart years ago by just\nforgetting about you. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cYES!\u201d you cheered, raising your hands in the air as you\nsunk the last ball making you and Chace the winners. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHoly shit girl you are the best beer pong partner EVER!\u201d he\nroared as he picked you up in his arms and spun you around. \u00a0You giggled but soon felt yourself get dizzy\nfrom all the drinking and spinning around. \nLuckily Chace set you down quickly. \n</p><p>Glancing around the apartment, you saw Chris and Sebastian\nsitting together on the couch. \u00a0They were\ntalking quietly to one another. \u00a0You\ncouldn\u2019t help but think what they were talking about. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Sebastian sighed,\ntaking another sip of his drink. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve\nbeen so close for the past decade and she never brought it up.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked to the floor; his elbows on his knees. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it too much man. \u00a0It\u2019s my fault really.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian looked at Chris, his brows raised in\nquestion. \u00a0\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?</p><p>Chris let out a deep sigh, shaking his head. \u00a0\u201cI mean I royally fucked up Seb. \u00a0We remained close for a few years after I\nmoved here to go to school. \u00a0But once I\ngot my first acting job, I just became so busy wanting to be with all these\nwomen that I slowly stopped texting her.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s mouth hung open. \n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me right now? \nYou\u2019ve known the girl since you were what, five, and you just decide to\nup and ignore her? \u00a0She\u2019s like the\ngreatest person on this planet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I know that Seb? \u00a0She\u2019s like the best thing that ever happened\nto me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how could you fuck this up? \u00a0I mean, shit looked tense between the two of\nyou, but I could see the chemistry immediately. \nWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Chris let out another deep breath, clasping his hands\ntogether. \u00a0\u201cHollywood happened. \u00a0One minute I\u2019m texting and calling her every\nday. \u00a0The next I get an actress\ngirlfriend who is insecure as fuck about me being close with a friend who\u2019s a\ngirl. \u00a0And I just\u2026.fuck I don\u2019t know. \u00a0The celebrity life got the best of me when I\nwas in my 20\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The two men looked over to see Jessica playing beer\npong. \u00a0She was smiling and laughing along\nwith the other guys, having the time of her life. \u00a0Chris smiled but still felt sad and like a\ntotal asshole for what he did to her. \nFrom such a young age, his heart belonged to her. \u00a0He used to think the two of them would get\nmarried one day;

his eyes glued to you in the\nrearview mirror. \u00a0</p><p>Your motions stilled as you fought with what to say. \u00a0You wanted nothing more than to bring him\ninside and have your way with him. \nWhether that meant to kiss him, or to scream at him, you had no\nidea. \u00a0In the end, your heart won\nover. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah. \u00a0Ok,\u201d you\nsoftly spoke. \u00a0</p><p>Pulling your keys from your purse you unlocked the door to\nthe building. \u00a0Chris trailed behind you\nas the two of you climbed the stairs to your floor. \u00a0You turned to look at him, giving him a soft\nsmile as you continued walking down the hall. \nAs you reached your apartment door, you sighed deeply before unlocking\nthe door. \u00a0</p><p>The two of you walked in and immediately Chris began to look\naround at his surroundings. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t\nmuch, but it was home. \u00a0Your apartment\nhad one bathroom and one bathroom. \u00a0Just\nbig enough for you. \u00a0Rent was expensive\nin New York City, but as a photographer who photographed celebrities and\nspecial events, you made enough to live comfortably. \u00a0</p><p>Chris began to look at your shelves and the pictures they\nbestowed. \u00a0As much as you wanted to have\npictures of the two of you; which you did have, you had to take them down as it\nhurt too much to look at them. \u00a0Instead,\nyou had pictures of your parents, and ones with you and some of the Evans\nfamily. \u00a0</p><p>He stopped in front of one picture with you, Lisa, Carly and\nShanna. \u00a0Chris took it off the shelf, as\nhe smiled. \u00a0\u201cThis is a great\npicture.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Walking over to him, you chuckled. \u00a0\u201cThat was a great day. \u00a0Us girls went to the spa and got\npampered. \u00a0I need another one of those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, my mom talks about you constantly whenever I\u2019m on\nthe phone with her. \u00a0She\u2019s always\nbragging about how good of a photographer you are. \u00a0She misses you.\u201d</p><p>That broke your heart. \nYou hadn\u2019t seen Lisa or any of the Evans siblings in nearly a year. \u00a0It was too hard to go back home. \u00a0Your house had been rented out since you\nmoved to New York City; not ready to sell it just yet. \u00a0In fact, you were going back home to Sudbury\nnext week as the tenants moved out and you were finally ready to sell. \u00a0It was a big house and you no matter how much\nyou wanted to keep it; New York was home to you now and you couldn\u2019t imagine\nliving in such an elaborately big house by yourself. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah I know. \u00a0But\nI\u2019ll see her next week,\u201d you remarked. \nChris looked at you with furrowed brows. \n\u201cI\u2019m selling the house so I need to get some cleaning and staging done.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked sad at your words. \u00a0But there was nothing he could do to change\nyour mind. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHave you put it up for sale yet?\u201d he asked. \u00a0</p><p>Shaking your head, you replied. \u00a0\u201cNot yet. \nI wanted to get some cleaning done. \nI\u2019ll be there next week and then I have a real estate agent coming over\nthe week after that.\u201d</p><p>Chris put the picture back onto the shelf before turning to\nyou. \u00a0His eyes looked pained as he took\nyou in. \u00a0The two of you staring at one\nanother; no words spoken. \u00a0He was so\nbeautiful and no matter how hard you tried to block all the feelings, you knew\ndeep down, he still held your heart. \u00a0</p><p>Your chin began to quiver as you turned your back to\nhim. \u00a0Breathing deeply, you clenched your\neyes shut. \u00a0It hurt you so much to be\nthis close to him, yet knowing he threw you away after just a few years of\nbeing in the spotlight. \u00a0</p><p>Turning back to face him, your eyes were glossed over with\ntears. \u00a0\u201cWhy Chris?\u201d you choked out. \u00a0\u201cWhy did you just toss me aside like I meant\nnothing to you?\u201d</p><p>\n\nChris slumped onto the couch, placing his head\ninto his large hands. \u00a0He took a few deep\nbreaths before looking up at you with tear filled eyes. \u00a0\n\n\n\n</p><p>Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PbYdDc36pCNDKtqt2H32A\">@jinoraskies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> @3dsaunt</p>",

drool practically seeping\nfrom your lips at the sight of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d you breathed out softly. \u00a0Chris stuffed his hands into his front\npockets, a lop sided grin on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d \u00a0You were\nunsure of what to even say, and it seemed the same for Chris. \u00a0You were able to read him like an open book\nas a look of guilt popped onto his beautiful face. \u00a0\u201cHow have you been?\u201d \u00a0he asked with a slight nervous tinge to his\nvoice. \u00a0</p><p>You shrugged, looking down at your feet. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been ok.\u201d \u00a0Looking back into his eyes, you just wanted\nto scream and kiss him at the same time. \n\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes met yours;

but he broke your heart years ago by just\nforgetting about you. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cYES!\u201d you cheered, raising your hands in the air as you\nsunk the last ball making you and Chace the winners. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHoly shit girl you are the best beer pong partner EVER!\u201d he\nroared as he picked you up in his arms and spun you around. \u00a0You giggled but soon felt yourself get dizzy\nfrom all the drinking and spinning around. \nLuckily Chace set you down quickly. \n</p><p>Glancing around the apartment, you saw Chris and Sebastian\nsitting together on the couch. \u00a0They were\ntalking quietly to one another. \u00a0You\ncouldn\u2019t help but think what they were talking about. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Sebastian sighed,\ntaking another sip of his drink. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve\nbeen so close for the past decade and she never brought it up.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked to the floor; his elbows on his knees. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it too much man. \u00a0It\u2019s my fault really.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian looked at Chris, his brows raised in\nquestion. \u00a0\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?</p><p>Chris let out a deep sigh, shaking his head. \u00a0\u201cI mean I royally fucked up Seb. \u00a0We remained close for a few years after I\nmoved here to go to school. \u00a0But once I\ngot my first acting job, I just became so busy wanting to be with all these\nwomen that I slowly stopped texting her.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s mouth hung open. \n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me right now? \nYou\u2019ve known the girl since you were what, five, and you just decide to\nup and ignore her? \u00a0She\u2019s like the\ngreatest person on this planet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I know that Seb? \u00a0She\u2019s like the best thing that ever happened\nto me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how could you fuck this up? \u00a0I mean, shit looked tense between the two of\nyou, but I could see the chemistry immediately. \nWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Chris let out another deep breath, clasping his hands\ntogether. \u00a0\u201cHollywood happened. \u00a0One minute I\u2019m texting and calling her every\nday. \u00a0The next I get an actress\ngirlfriend who is insecure as fuck about me being close with a friend who\u2019s a\ngirl. \u00a0And I just\u2026.fuck I don\u2019t know. \u00a0The celebrity life got the best of me when I\nwas in my 20\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The two men looked over to see Jessica playing beer\npong. \u00a0She was smiling and laughing along\nwith the other guys, having the time of her life. \u00a0Chris smiled but still felt sad and like a\ntotal asshole for what he did to her. \nFrom such a young age, his heart belonged to her. \u00a0He used to think the two of them would get\nmarried one day; have a family together. \nBut he knew he fucked that all up now. \n</p><p>\u201cJess is really forgiving. \nJust talk to her. \u00a0Tell her the\ntruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know man. \u00a0I\nmean, it\u2019s been fucking years since I\u2019ve talked to her before today. \u00a0There\u2019s no excuse I could say to make this\nany better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I know Jessica the way I do, she\u2019s getting tired and\ngoing to want to go home. \u00a0Offer to take\nher home and talk to her. \u00a0Just seeing\nyou two next to each other-you seem like the perfect pair.\u201d</p><p>That got a chuckle from Chris. \u00a0</p><p>In a matter of minutes, Jessica came up to Sebastian,\ntelling him she was ready to go home. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>A yawn escaped your lips as you looked at your phone. \u00a0Yep, time to get your ass back home and into\nbed. \u00a0</p><p>Sebastian was still talking to Chris, and no matter how much\nyou didn\u2019t want to go over there, you had to say goodbye to Sebastian. \u00a0</p><p>Grabbing your purse and jacket, you made your way through\nthe small crowd and to the couch where the boys were sitting. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late. \nI\u2019m going to head home,\u201d you said with a soft smile. \u00a0</p><p>You saw Sebastian nudge Chris. \u00a0\u201cI can take you home,\u201d Chris pipped up with\nhopeful eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s ok. \u00a0I was\ngoing to order an Uber,\u201d came your curt reply. \n</p><p>\u201cI insist. \u00a0Please. \nI have a rental car. \u00a0You don\u2019t\nneed to waste money on an Uber.\u201d</p><p>As much as your mind was screaming at you to say no, to just\nwalk away from this right now, your heart was telling you the complete\nopposite. \u00a0Nodding your head, you gave\nSebastian a hug. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this,\u201d he whispered in your\near. \u00a0You knew he was mad about you not\ntelling him about Chris, and you damn well knew you were going to get an earful\nabout it;

his eyes glued to you in the\nrearview mirror. \u00a0</p><p>Your motions stilled as you fought with what to say. \u00a0You wanted nothing more than to bring him\ninside and have your way with him. \nWhether that meant to kiss him, or to scream at him, you had no\nidea. \u00a0In the end, your heart won\nover. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah. \u00a0Ok,\u201d you\nsoftly spoke. \u00a0</p><p>Pulling your keys from your purse you unlocked the door to\nthe building. \u00a0Chris trailed behind you\nas the two of you climbed the stairs to your floor. \u00a0You turned to look at him, giving him a soft\nsmile as you continued walking down the hall. \nAs you reached your apartment door, you sighed deeply before unlocking\nthe door. \u00a0</p><p>The two of you walked in and immediately Chris began to look\naround at his surroundings. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t\nmuch, but it was home. \u00a0Your apartment\nhad one bathroom and one bathroom. \u00a0Just\nbig enough for you. \u00a0Rent was expensive\nin New York City, but as a photographer who photographed celebrities and\nspecial events, you made enough to live comfortably. \u00a0</p><p>Chris began to look at your shelves and the pictures they\nbestowed. \u00a0As much as you wanted to have\npictures of the two of you; which you did have, you had to take them down as it\nhurt too much to look at them. \u00a0Instead,\nyou had pictures of your parents, and ones with you and some of the Evans\nfamily. \u00a0</p><p>He stopped in front of one picture with you, Lisa, Carly and\nShanna. \u00a0Chris took it off the shelf, as\nhe smiled. \u00a0\u201cThis is a great\npicture.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Walking over to him, you chuckled. \u00a0\u201cThat was a great day. \u00a0Us girls went to the spa and got\npampered. \u00a0I need another one of those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, my mom talks about you constantly whenever I\u2019m on\nthe phone with her. \u00a0She\u2019s always\nbragging about how good of a photographer you are. \u00a0She misses you.\u201d</p><p>That broke your heart. \nYou hadn\u2019t seen Lisa or any of the Evans siblings in nearly a year. \u00a0It was too hard to go back home. \u00a0Your house had been rented out since you\nmoved to New York City; not ready to sell it just yet. \u00a0In fact, you were going back home to Sudbury\nnext week as the tenants moved out and you were finally ready to sell. \u00a0It was a big house and you no matter how much\nyou wanted to keep it; New York was home to you now and you couldn\u2019t imagine\nliving in such an elaborately big house by yourself. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah I know. \u00a0But\nI\u2019ll see her next week,\u201d you remarked. \nChris looked at you with furrowed brows. \n\u201cI\u2019m selling the house so I need to get some cleaning and staging done.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked sad at your words. \u00a0But there was nothing he could do to change\nyour mind. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHave you put it up for sale yet?\u201d he asked. \u00a0</p><p>Shaking your head, you replied. \u00a0\u201cNot yet. \nI wanted to get some cleaning done. \nI\u2019ll be there next week and then I have a real estate agent coming over\nthe week after that.\u201d</p><p>Chris put the picture back onto the shelf before turning to\nyou. \u00a0His eyes looked pained as he took\nyou in. \u00a0The two of you staring at one\nanother; no words spoken. \u00a0He was so\nbeautiful and no matter how hard you tried to block all the feelings, you knew\ndeep down, he still held your heart. \u00a0</p><p>Your chin began to quiver as you turned your back to\nhim. \u00a0Breathing deeply, you clenched your\neyes shut. \u00a0It hurt you so much to be\nthis close to him, yet knowing he threw you away after just a few years of\nbeing in the spotlight. \u00a0</p><p>Turning back to face him, your eyes were glossed over with\ntears. \u00a0\u201cWhy Chris?\u201d you choked out. \u00a0\u201cWhy did you just toss me aside like I meant\nnothing to you?\u201d</p><p>\n\nChris slumped onto the couch, placing his head\ninto his large hands. \u00a0He took a few deep\nbreaths before looking up at you with tear filled eyes. \u00a0\n\n\n\n</p><p>Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PbYdDc36pCNDKtqt2H32A\">@jinoraskies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> @3dsaunt</p></p>",

drool practically seeping\nfrom your lips at the sight of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d you breathed out softly. \u00a0Chris stuffed his hands into his front\npockets, a lop sided grin on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d \u00a0You were\nunsure of what to even say, and it seemed the same for Chris. \u00a0You were able to read him like an open book\nas a look of guilt popped onto his beautiful face. \u00a0\u201cHow have you been?\u201d \u00a0he asked with a slight nervous tinge to his\nvoice. \u00a0</p><p>You shrugged, looking down at your feet. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been ok.\u201d \u00a0Looking back into his eyes, you just wanted\nto scream and kiss him at the same time. \n\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes met yours; a hint of sadness behind them. \u00a0\u201cUmm, yeah I\u2019ve been good. \u00a0Working a lot so that\u2019s kept me pretty busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d was all you managed to say with a raise of your\nbrows. \u00a0Of course he was \u2018so\u2019 busy that\nhe couldn\u2019t even bother to text or call you back after so many years. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook Jess\u2026\u201d he began to say when the door to the balcony\nopened. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Jess, you wanna play another round of beer pong and be\non my team this time?\u201d Chace asked with a smile. \u00a0Your own relieved smile spread across your\nface. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d you replied. \nLooking back to Chris, you gave him a tight smile. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you around.\u201d \u00a0It nearly broke your heart to be so short\nwith your responses to him; but he broke your heart years ago by just\nforgetting about you. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cYES!\u201d you cheered, raising your hands in the air as you\nsunk the last ball making you and Chace the winners. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHoly shit girl you are the best beer pong partner EVER!\u201d he\nroared as he picked you up in his arms and spun you around. \u00a0You giggled but soon felt yourself get dizzy\nfrom all the drinking and spinning around. \nLuckily Chace set you down quickly. \n</p><p>Glancing around the apartment, you saw Chris and Sebastian\nsitting together on the couch. \u00a0They were\ntalking quietly to one another. \u00a0You\ncouldn\u2019t help but think what they were talking about. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Sebastian sighed,\ntaking another sip of his drink. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve\nbeen so close for the past decade and she never brought it up.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked to the floor; his elbows on his knees. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it too much man. \u00a0It\u2019s my fault really.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian looked at Chris, his brows raised in\nquestion. \u00a0\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?</p><p>Chris let out a deep sigh, shaking his head. \u00a0\u201cI mean I royally fucked up Seb. \u00a0We remained close for a few years after I\nmoved here to go to school. \u00a0But once I\ngot my first acting job, I just became so busy wanting to be with all these\nwomen that I slowly stopped texting her.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s mouth hung open. \n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me right now? \nYou\u2019ve known the girl since you were what, five, and you just decide to\nup and ignore her? \u00a0She\u2019s like the\ngreatest person on this planet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I know that Seb? \u00a0She\u2019s like the best thing that ever happened\nto me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how could you fuck this up? \u00a0I mean, shit looked tense between the two of\nyou, but I could see the chemistry immediately. \nWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Chris let out another deep breath, clasping his hands\ntogether. \u00a0\u201cHollywood happened. \u00a0One minute I\u2019m texting and calling her every\nday. \u00a0The next I get an actress\ngirlfriend who is insecure as fuck about me being close with a friend who\u2019s a\ngirl. \u00a0And I just\u2026.fuck I don\u2019t know. \u00a0The celebrity life got the best of me when I\nwas in my 20\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The two men looked over to see Jessica playing beer\npong. \u00a0She was smiling and laughing along\nwith the other guys, having the time of her life. \u00a0Chris smiled but still felt sad and like a\ntotal asshole for what he did to her. \nFrom such a young age, his heart belonged to her. \u00a0He used to think the two of them would get\nmarried one day; have a family together. \nBut he knew he fucked that all up now. \n</p><p>\u201cJess is really forgiving. \nJust talk to her. \u00a0Tell her the\ntruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know man. \u00a0I\nmean, it\u2019s been fucking years since I\u2019ve talked to her before today. \u00a0There\u2019s no excuse I could say to make this\nany better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I know Jessica the way I do, she\u2019s getting tired and\ngoing to want to go home. \u00a0Offer to take\nher home and talk to her. \u00a0Just seeing\nyou two next to each other-you seem like the perfect pair.\u201d</p><p>That got a chuckle from Chris. \u00a0</p><p>In a matter of minutes, Jessica came up to Sebastian,\ntelling him she was ready to go home. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>A yawn escaped your lips as you looked at your phone. \u00a0Yep, time to get your ass back home and into\nbed. \u00a0</p><p>Sebastian was still talking to Chris, and no matter how much\nyou didn\u2019t want to go over there, you had to say goodbye to Sebastian. \u00a0</p><p>Grabbing your purse and jacket, you made your way through\nthe small crowd and to the couch where the boys were sitting. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late. \nI\u2019m going to head home,\u201d you said with a soft smile. \u00a0</p><p>You saw Sebastian nudge Chris. \u00a0\u201cI can take you home,\u201d Chris pipped up with\nhopeful eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s ok. \u00a0I was\ngoing to order an Uber,\u201d came your curt reply. \n</p><p>\u201cI insist. \u00a0Please. \nI have a rental car. \u00a0You don\u2019t\nneed to waste money on an Uber.\u201d</p><p>As much as your mind was screaming at you to say no, to just\nwalk away from this right now, your heart was telling you the complete\nopposite. \u00a0Nodding your head, you gave\nSebastian a hug. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this,\u201d he whispered in your\near. \u00a0You knew he was mad about you not\ntelling him about Chris, and you damn well knew you were going to get an earful\nabout it; probably bright and early tomorrow. \n</p><p>You and Chris walked silently downstairs and out into the\ncool night air. \u00a0You followed him until\nhe stopped in front of his rental, opening the passenger car door for you. \u00a0</p><p>Without a moment\u2019s notice, your breath hitched at the sight\nof the front passenger seat. \u00a0Your palms\nbegan to sweat as your breathing came up short. \nChris noticed and you were quickly wrapped up in his strong arms. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit Jess. \u00a0I\u2019m such\nan idiot. \u00a0I completely forgot about\nthis,\u201d Chris\u2019 voice was soothing. \u00a0</p><p>After your parents were killed by a drunk driver, it had\nbeen difficult for you to be anywhere near the front seat of a car. \u00a0You usually took trains, Ubers, or walked\neverywhere. \u00a0There wasn\u2019t much a need for\ncars in New York City. \u00a0The last time you\nwere in the front seat of a car was after your parents\u2019 accident and you had a\npanic attack. \u00a0Lisa was driving, Chris\nwas in the backseat and she had to pull over to calm you down. \u00a0Ever since then, it\u2019s only been backseats for\nyou as you just felt more comfortable that way. \n</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit in the backseat?\u201d Chris\u2019 voice broke you\nfrom your thoughts. \u00a0You gave him a\nslight nod as he closed the door and opened the door to the backseat. \u00a0</p><p>You got in and buckled yourself as Chris got into the\ndriver\u2019s seat. \u00a0You gave him your address\nand he typed it into his phone. </p><p>Before you knew it, you were pulled up outside your\napartment building. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for the ride Chris,\u201d you said as you unbuckled\nyourself. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I come in? \u00a0Can\nwe talk?\u201d Chris asked from the front seat; his eyes glued to you in the\nrearview mirror. \u00a0</p><p>Your motions stilled as you fought with what to say. \u00a0You wanted nothing more than to bring him\ninside and have your way with him. \nWhether that meant to kiss him, or to scream at him, you had no\nidea. \u00a0In the end, your heart won\nover. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah. \u00a0Ok,\u201d you\nsoftly spoke. \u00a0</p><p>Pulling your keys from your purse you unlocked the door to\nthe building. \u00a0Chris trailed behind you\nas the two of you climbed the stairs to your floor. \u00a0You turned to look at him, giving him a soft\nsmile as you continued walking down the hall. \nAs you reached your apartment door, you sighed deeply before unlocking\nthe door. \u00a0</p><p>The two of you walked in and immediately Chris began to look\naround at his surroundings. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t\nmuch, but it was home. \u00a0Your apartment\nhad one bathroom and one bathroom. \u00a0Just\nbig enough for you. \u00a0Rent was expensive\nin New York City, but as a photographer who photographed celebrities and\nspecial events, you made enough to live comfortably. \u00a0</p><p>Chris began to look at your shelves and the pictures they\nbestowed. \u00a0As much as you wanted to have\npictures of the two of you; which you did have, you had to take them down as it\nhurt too much to look at them. \u00a0Instead,\nyou had pictures of your parents, and ones with you and some of the Evans\nfamily. \u00a0</p><p>He stopped in front of one picture with you, Lisa, Carly and\nShanna. \u00a0Chris took it off the shelf, as\nhe smiled. \u00a0\u201cThis is a great\npicture.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Walking over to him, you chuckled. \u00a0\u201cThat was a great day. \u00a0Us girls went to the spa and got\npampered. \u00a0I need another one of those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, my mom talks about you constantly whenever I\u2019m on\nthe phone with her. \u00a0She\u2019s always\nbragging about how good of a photographer you are. \u00a0She misses you.\u201d</p><p>That broke your heart. \nYou hadn\u2019t seen Lisa or any of the Evans siblings in nearly a year. \u00a0It was too hard to go back home. \u00a0Your house had been rented out since you\nmoved to New York City; not ready to sell it just yet. \u00a0In fact, you were going back home to Sudbury\nnext week as the tenants moved out and you were finally ready to sell. \u00a0It was a big house and you no matter how much\nyou wanted to keep it; New York was home to you now and you couldn\u2019t imagine\nliving in such an elaborately big house by yourself. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah I know. \u00a0But\nI\u2019ll see her next week,\u201d you remarked. \nChris looked at you with furrowed brows. \n\u201cI\u2019m selling the house so I need to get some cleaning and staging done.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked sad at your words. \u00a0But there was nothing he could do to change\nyour mind. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHave you put it up for sale yet?\u201d he asked. \u00a0</p><p>Shaking your head, you replied. \u00a0\u201cNot yet. \nI wanted to get some cleaning done. \nI\u2019ll be there next week and then I have a real estate agent coming over\nthe week after that.\u201d</p><p>Chris put the picture back onto the shelf before turning to\nyou. \u00a0His eyes looked pained as he took\nyou in. \u00a0The two of you staring at one\nanother; no words spoken. \u00a0He was so\nbeautiful and no matter how hard you tried to block all the feelings, you knew\ndeep down, he still held your heart. \u00a0</p><p>Your chin began to quiver as you turned your back to\nhim. \u00a0Breathing deeply, you clenched your\neyes shut. \u00a0It hurt you so much to be\nthis close to him, yet knowing he threw you away after just a few years of\nbeing in the spotlight. \u00a0</p><p>Turning back to face him, your eyes were glossed over with\ntears. \u00a0\u201cWhy Chris?\u201d you choked out. \u00a0\u201cWhy did you just toss me aside like I meant\nnothing to you?\u201d</p><p>\n\nChris slumped onto the couch, placing his head\ninto his large hands. \u00a0He took a few deep\nbreaths before looking up at you with tear filled eyes. \u00a0\n\n\n\n</p><p>Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PbYdDc36pCNDKtqt2H32A\">@jinoraskies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> @3dsaunt</p></p>",

Angst, Swearing</p><p><b>Summary: </b>After\nlosing touch with your childhood best friend after graduation, he comes\ncrashing back into your life 15 years later. \nThe feelings you&rsquo;ve had for him never left you. &nbsp;But do you forgive him for all those years he\nignored you? &nbsp;Or do you decide he lost\nhis chance with you for good?</p><p>&ldquo;Jess,&rdquo; his soft voice bringing you back to reality. &nbsp;</p><p>Slowly you turned around, your gaze moving up his body and\nto his face. &nbsp;When your eyes mixed with\nhis, it felt like the wind was knocked out of you. &nbsp;He was more handsome than ever. &nbsp;From all the years playing Captain America,\nhe really bulked up his body. &nbsp;His\nmuscles pressed tightly against his black t-shirt; drool practically seeping\nfrom your lips at the sight of him. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; you breathed out softly. &nbsp;Chris stuffed his hands into his front\npockets, a lop sided grin on his face. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; &nbsp;You were\nunsure of what to even say, and it seemed the same for Chris. &nbsp;You were able to read him like an open book\nas a look of guilt popped onto his beautiful face. &nbsp;&ldquo;How have you been?&rdquo; &nbsp;he asked with a slight nervous tinge to his\nvoice. &nbsp;</p><p>You shrugged, looking down at your feet. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ok.&rdquo; &nbsp;Looking back into his eyes, you just wanted\nto scream and kiss him at the same time. \n&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>Chris&rsquo; eyes met yours; a hint of sadness behind them. &nbsp;&ldquo;Umm, yeah I&rsquo;ve been good. &nbsp;Working a lot so that&rsquo;s kept me pretty busy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm,&rdquo; was all you managed to say with a raise of your\nbrows. &nbsp;Of course he was &lsquo;so&rsquo; busy that\nhe couldn&rsquo;t even bother to text or call you back after so many years. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Look Jess&hellip;&rdquo; he began to say when the door to the balcony\nopened. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Jess, you wanna play another round of beer pong and be\non my team this time?&rdquo; Chace asked with a smile. &nbsp;Your own relieved smile spread across your\nface. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; you replied. \nLooking back to Chris, you gave him a tight smile. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you around.&rdquo; &nbsp;It nearly broke your heart to be so short\nwith your responses to him; but he broke your heart years ago by just\nforgetting about you. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p>&ldquo;YES!&rdquo; you cheered, raising your hands in the air as you\nsunk the last ball making you and Chace the winners. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit girl you are the best beer pong partner EVER!&rdquo; he\nroared as he picked you up in his arms and spun you around. &nbsp;You giggled but soon felt yourself get dizzy\nfrom all the drinking and spinning around. \nLuckily Chace set you down quickly. \n</p><p>Glancing around the apartment, you saw Chris and Sebastian\nsitting together on the couch. &nbsp;They were\ntalking quietly to one another. &nbsp;You\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but think what they were talking about. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe she didn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; Sebastian sighed,\ntaking another sip of his drink. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve\nbeen so close for the past decade and she never brought it up.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris looked to the floor; his elbows on his knees. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sweat it too much man. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s my fault really.&rdquo;</p><p>Sebastian looked at Chris, his brows raised in\nquestion. &nbsp;&ldquo;What the hell does that mean?</p><p>Chris let out a deep sigh, shaking his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean I royally fucked up Seb. &nbsp;We remained close for a few years after I\nmoved here to go to school. &nbsp;But once I\ngot my first acting job, I just became so busy wanting to be with all these\nwomen that I slowly stopped texting her.&rdquo;</p><p>Sebastian&rsquo;s mouth hung open. \n&ldquo;Are you fucking kidding me right now? \nYou&rsquo;ve known the girl since you were what, five, and you just decide to\nup and ignore her? &nbsp;She&rsquo;s like the\ngreatest person on this planet!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I know that Seb? &nbsp;She&rsquo;s like the best thing that ever happened\nto me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then how could you fuck this up? &nbsp;I mean, shit looked tense between the two of\nyou, but I could see the chemistry immediately. \nWhat the hell happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Chris let out another deep breath, clasping his hands\ntogether. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hollywood happened. &nbsp;One minute I&rsquo;m texting and calling her every\nday. &nbsp;The next I get an actress\ngirlfriend who is insecure as fuck about me being close with a friend who&rsquo;s a\ngirl. &nbsp;And I just&hellip;.fuck I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;The celebrity life got the best of me when I\nwas in my 20&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>The two men looked over to see Jessica playing beer\npong. &nbsp;She was smiling and laughing along\nwith the other guys, having the time of her life. &nbsp;Chris smiled but still felt sad and like a\ntotal asshole for what he did to her. \nFrom such a young age, his heart belonged to her. &nbsp;He used to think the two of them would get\nmarried one day;

&nbsp;</p><p>Walking over to him, you chuckled. &nbsp;&ldquo;That was a great day. &nbsp;Us girls went to the spa and got\npampered. &nbsp;I need another one of those days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, my mom talks about you constantly whenever I&rsquo;m on\nthe phone with her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s always\nbragging about how good of a photographer you are. &nbsp;She misses you.&rdquo;</p><p>That broke your heart. \nYou hadn&rsquo;t seen Lisa or any of the Evans siblings in nearly a year. &nbsp;It was too hard to go back home. &nbsp;Your house had been rented out since you\nmoved to New York City; not ready to sell it just yet. &nbsp;In fact, you were going back home to Sudbury\nnext week as the tenants moved out and you were finally ready to sell. &nbsp;It was a big house and you no matter how much\nyou wanted to keep it; New York was home to you now and you couldn&rsquo;t imagine\nliving in such an elaborately big house by yourself. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I know. &nbsp;But\nI&rsquo;ll see her next week,&rdquo; you remarked. \nChris looked at you with furrowed brows. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m selling the house so I need to get some cleaning and staging done.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris looked sad at your words. &nbsp;But there was nothing he could do to change\nyour mind. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you put it up for sale yet?&rdquo; he asked. &nbsp;</p><p>Shaking your head, you replied. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not yet. \nI wanted to get some cleaning done. \nI&rsquo;ll be there next week and then I have a real estate agent coming over\nthe week after that.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris put the picture back onto the shelf before turning to\nyou. &nbsp;His eyes looked pained as he took\nyou in. &nbsp;The two of you staring at one\nanother; no words spoken. &nbsp;He was so\nbeautiful and no matter how hard you tried to block all the feelings, you knew\ndeep down, he still held your heart. &nbsp;</p><p>Your chin began to quiver as you turned your back to\nhim. &nbsp;Breathing deeply, you clenched your\neyes shut. &nbsp;It hurt you so much to be\nthis close to him, yet knowing he threw you away after just a few years of\nbeing in the spotlight. &nbsp;</p><p>Turning back to face him, your eyes were glossed over with\ntears. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why Chris?&rdquo; you choked out. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why did you just toss me aside like I meant\nnothing to you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nChris slumped onto the couch, placing his head\ninto his large hands. &nbsp;He took a few deep\nbreaths before looking up at you with tear filled eyes. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n</p><p>Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PbYdDc36pCNDKtqt2H32A\">@jinoraskies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> @3dsaunt</p></p>",
