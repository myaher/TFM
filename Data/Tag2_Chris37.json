While Mark was shifting his way to the empty chair next to Chris. Chris pulled out his phone and typed a quick message to Y/N; just to check up on how she was doing. She had just entered her third trimester, and to say that they were excited would be an understatement. He glanced up at the crew smiling and waiting for a response from Y/N. Once he was done with their unfortunately very short conversation, he slipped his phone into his pocket. </p><p>He smiled at Mark as he clapped his shoulder, catching Chris\u2019 attention. \u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d The cast has always been in love with Y/N, knowing that she was perfect for Chris.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing good, just overall quite excited. She can\u2019t stop sending me pictures of things she bought\u201d Chris smiled turning back to the interviewer as they began recording. The interviewer smiled at the group, beginning to introduce them and start talking about the movie that was on everyone\u2019s mind. </p><!-- more --><p>Only Chris had two things on his mind other than the movie; Y/N and their baby. After a short moment, he noticed both Mark and the interviewer were staring at him; realizing that he was asked a question. He shook his head and apologized. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, what was the question?\u201d</p><p>The rest began to laugh, as the interviewer said, \u201cit seems like there&rsquo;s a lot on your mind.\u201d </p><p>The crowd laughed as Mark from beside Chris elbowed him. \u201cRight, that&rsquo;s what happens when you\u2019re expecting your first child.\u201d \u00a0At that moment, Chris\u2019 eyes grew wide while Mark gasped at the fact that he just spilled the beans on something on the air that wasn\u2019t even his secret, to begin with. <br/>\u201cOh shit!\u201d It was quiet for a whole minute, no one daring to say anything. While the interviewer was also trying to figure out what to say next. </p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like the cats out if the bag now,\u201d Chris, awkwardly chuckled, breaking the very deafening silence.</p><p>Mark turned to Chris, hand still covering his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry man.\u201d</p><p>Chris took a minute, not knowing what to say only to chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s alright man.

Right, when Chris got the chance, he pulled out his phone again and began texting his wife a brief summary of everything that just took place. \u2018We slightly have a problem.\u2019 </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t take to long to respond. \u2018What&rsquo;s wrong?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The cat&rsquo;s out of the bag,\u2019 </p><p>It was only a minute after he pressed send, that a picture of Y/N from their wedding day popped up on his screen; notifying him that she was calling. </p><p>\u201cWhat cat? I\u2019m so confused,\u201d her laugh filled the other end of the call and the speaker.</p><p>\u201cY/N, the cat being you\u2019re pregnant is out of the bag, Mark slipped it out during an interview.&ldquo;</p><p>Y/N was silent for a few seconds but soon filled that silence by saying, \u201cit\u2019s alright, we\u2019ll make a post saying our part and how excited we are. Nothing has changed, really. </p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just,\u201d Chris sighed deeply, &quot;we were excited to be the ones to share the news,\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, baby, but it happened and I\u2019m sure Mark didn\u2019t intentionally mean to ruin it for us. We just have to move forward and remember everything happens for a reason. Maybe this way it would be easier to just post something simple and not have everyone expecting some grand reveal.\u201d </p><p>Chris nodded along to Y/N\u2019s words, he could see her point and knew that the damage was already done and there wasn&rsquo;t much they could do about it now. \u00a0</p><p>&quot;Thank Mark for me, yeah?\u201d Y/N\u2019s voice pulled Chris from his deep thoughts. \u00a0He replied with a chuckle, feeling better than before as he bid farewell to Y/N and made his way to Mark. He could still see the look of regret on Mark\u2019s face so he simply, clapped his back and assured him that everything was okay; just like Y/N said. <br/></p><h2>Want to be added to a taglist? <a

Right, when Chris got the chance, he pulled out his phone again and began texting his wife a brief summary of everything that just took place. \u2018We slightly have a problem.\u2019 </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t take to long to respond. \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The cat\u2019s out of the bag,\u2019 </p><p>It was only a minute after he pressed send, that a picture of Y/N from their wedding day popped up on his screen; notifying him that she was calling. </p><p>\u201cWhat cat? I\u2019m so confused,\u201d her laugh filled the other end of the call and the speaker.</p><p>\u201cY/N, the cat being you\u2019re pregnant is out of the bag, Mark slipped it out during an interview.\u201c</p><p>Y/N was silent for a few seconds but soon filled that silence by saying, \u201cit\u2019s alright, we\u2019ll make a post saying our part and how excited we are. Nothing has changed, really. </p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just,\u201d Chris sighed deeply, \"we were excited to be the ones to share the news,\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, baby, but it happened and I\u2019m sure Mark didn\u2019t intentionally mean to ruin it for us. We just have to move forward and remember everything happens for a reason. Maybe this way it would be easier to just post something simple and not have everyone expecting some grand reveal.\u201d </p><p>Chris nodded along to Y/N\u2019s words, he could see her point and knew that the damage was already done and there wasn\u2019t much they could do about it now. \u00a0</p><p>\"Thank Mark for me, yeah?\u201d Y/N\u2019s voice pulled Chris from his deep thoughts. \u00a0He replied with a chuckle, feeling better than before as he bid farewell to Y/N and made his way to Mark. He could still see the look of regret on Mark\u2019s face so he simply, clapped his back and assured him that everything was okay; just like Y/N said. <br></p><h2>Want to be added to a taglist? <a

Right, when Chris got the chance, he pulled out his phone again and began texting his wife a brief summary of everything that just took place. &lsquo;We slightly have a problem.&rsquo; </p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t take to long to respond. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;The cat&rsquo;s out of the bag,&rsquo; </p><p>It was only a minute after he pressed send, that a picture of Y/N from their wedding day popped up on his screen; notifying him that she was calling. </p><p>&ldquo;What cat? I&rsquo;m so confused,&rdquo; her laugh filled the other end of the call and the speaker.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, the cat being you&rsquo;re pregnant is out of the bag, Mark slipped it out during an interview.&ldquo;</p><p>Y/N was silent for a few seconds but soon filled that silence by saying, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s alright, we&rsquo;ll make a post saying our part and how excited we are. Nothing has changed, really. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, it&rsquo;s just,&rdquo; Chris sighed deeply, \"we were excited to be the ones to share the news,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know, baby, but it happened and I&rsquo;m sure Mark didn&rsquo;t intentionally mean to ruin it for us. We just have to move forward and remember everything happens for a reason. Maybe this way it would be easier to just post something simple and not have everyone expecting some grand reveal.&rdquo; </p><p>Chris nodded along to Y/N&rsquo;s words, he could see her point and knew that the damage was already done and there wasn&rsquo;t much they could do about it now. &nbsp;</p><p>\"Thank Mark for me, yeah?&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s voice pulled Chris from his deep thoughts. &nbsp;He replied with a chuckle, feeling better than before as he bid farewell to Y/N and made his way to Mark. He could still see the look of regret on Mark&rsquo;s face so he simply, clapped his back and assured him that everything was okay; just like Y/N said. <br /></p><h2>Want to be added to a taglist? <a href=\"https://giftofdreams.tumblr.com/ask\">Just Ask, I Don&rsquo;t Bite &#128513;</a></h2><p><b>Forever Taglist: </b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTo2nVNz2N2ogaVa7JHUlQw\"><b>@hometonvld</b></a><b> </b></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\"><b>@ssweet-empowerment</b></a><b> </b></b></p><p><b><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QBjEbO5niGUOoQ31qyjKA\">@m-a-t-91 </a> </b></b></p><p><b><b>@nygmaros </b></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mszAuGVi8GC2qzeaVa-fNcA\"><b></b></a><b><a>@jennylovelyheart</a> </b><b> </b></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt7xkc5FQdNINJqWAlqJueA\"><b>@courtneychicken</b></a><b> </b></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr4sIF9XX-M9oXNRvVBGYpg\"><b>@soldierwinterthe</b></a><b> &nbsp;

While Mark was shifting his way to the empty chair next to Chris. Chris pulled out his phone and typed a quick message to Y/N; just to check up on how she was doing. She had just entered her third trimester, and to say that they were excited would be an understatement. He glanced up at the crew smiling and waiting for a response from Y/N. Once he was done with their unfortunately very short conversation, he slipped his phone into his pocket. </p>\n<p>He smiled at Mark as he clapped his shoulder, catching Chris&rsquo; attention. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s she doing?&rdquo; The cast has always been in love with Y/N, knowing that she was perfect for Chris.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing good, just overall quite excited. She can&rsquo;t stop sending me pictures of things she bought&rdquo; Chris smiled turning back to the interviewer as they began recording. The interviewer smiled at the group, beginning to introduce them and start talking about the movie that was on everyone&rsquo;s mind. </p>\n</p>",

Thus this work was born.</p><p>AO3 Link <b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18923443\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a></b></p><!-- more --><p>\tChris wasn\u2019t supposed to know. She didn\u2019t want him to be upset or weirded out by the fact that she sometimes masturbated to him in the Capt costume. But goddamn was the man sexy in it. Her favorite was the WWII costume. That soft brown leather jacket, that she knew was in his closet, and the booty shorts that accentuated his perfect ass. But she often had her fingers buried in her sopping cunt to the Stealth Suit of Sex.</p><p>\tShe curled around his pillow that didn\u2019t quite smell like him anymore and held the phone a little higher. \u201cWhat time does your flight land, babydoll?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c3pm.\u201d He looked so disappointed that she almost changed her flight right then and booked the Uber but she needed sleep. \u201cI can\u2019t get an earlier flight unless I fly out tonight. But then I\u2019ll be a tired, grouchy mess tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either. I want to enjoy my few days with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame, babe.\u201d He stretched out in the bed and the sound of skin on crisp sheets came through the speakers. \u201cI\u2019ll have a car waiting for you. You can come to the set or go to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tough choice.\u201d They smiled at each other. She checked the time. \u201cYou should be asleep, baby. You\u2019ve got early call in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to my girl. Sleep can wait. I\u2019ll snag a nap before lunch or something.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou need your rest, Chris. You\u2019re gonna see me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, but I wanna see you now.\u201d His voice dropped an octave, growing husky and deep. \u201cCan I see you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\tShe smirked. \u201cOf course.\u201d She bit her lip then bit the tip of her finger. Even though they\u2019d been together for a while, she still felt nervous asking him for the same even though he\u2019d never denied her. \u201cCan I see you?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou first, babygirl.\u201d Her belly dropped, bringing more wetness to her. She panned the camera down her body. The thin camisole nighty had ridden up her thighs. He licked his lips and palmed his cock in the loose boxers. \u201cAre you wearing panties, babe?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShow me.\u201d She let her legs fall open and held the camera at the best angle to show him her glistening pussy. \u201cSomeone\u2019s wet.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAlways for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\tHe hummed in appreciation. \u201cYou gonna pet that pretty pussy for me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGo head then.\u201d She propped the phone on a pillow between her legs so he could see her pussy in the screen. She slipped her fingers between her folds and rubbed up and down, not touching her clit just yet. \u201cPlay with your tits, babe.\u201d</p><p>\tShe pulled the neckline of the nightie down to expose her breasts. She palmed one then the other, squeezing and pinching the nipples. \u201cLike that, baby?\u201d</p><p>\tHe moaned. \u201cYes, just like that.\u201d</p><p>\tShe nestled into the pillows, opening her pussy up to him. Her clit peeked out of its hood as she rubbed around it. He licked his lips. \u201cLet me see you, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\tHe reclined against a headboard. He panned the camera down his bare chest to his lap and his long, thick cock standing straight up. The tip glistened with a drop of precum. She moaned. \u201cKeep making those sounds and I\u2019m gonna blow my load.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI can make plenty more.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh I know.\u201d He laid the phone on his belly. His face was hidden and he couldn\u2019t see her anymore, but she got a glorious view of him stroking his cock. She sighed, her lips parting. His stroking hand twisted at the tip.</p><p>\t\u201cFuck, I love watching your stroke your cock.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know you do, baby. My dirty girl.\u201d He picked up his phone and the image of his cock disappeared to be filled by his face. \u201cI need to see you cum.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOk, baby.\u201d She stroked her clit, looking him in the eyes through the screen. She pretended the handsome face between her legs was eating her pussy; his stroking her clit.</p><p>\t\u201cYou gonna cum for me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, Chris.\u201d Fuck, he loved when she said his name all breathy and wrecked like that. Her fingers rubbed faster, more pressure, faster, more pressure. Her legs trembled the closer she got. He moaned her name and fuck her whole goddamn life if it wasn\u2019t the sexiest sound she\u2019d ever heard. Her back bowed, string taught and she came with a deep, passionate moan.</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck, baby, that was beautiful. I wish I could taste your pussy right now.\u201d She whimpered. His image shook slightly with his vigorous stroking. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to feel you wrapped around my cock.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck yeah, I\u2019m gonna sink in you so deep you can\u2019t fucking breathe. Then I\u2019m gonna fuck the shit of you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, please, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShow me your ass.\u201d She rolled up onto her knees and tipped her ass up. She held one cheek open. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck, fuck, fuck, M\u2019gonna cum. Fuck!\u201d He groaned loud and long then fell to panting breaths. \u201cJesus Christ, I fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>\tShe giggled and brought the phone to her face, kissing him image. \u201cAnd I love you. Now, get some sleep, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI will. Gonna clean up and rack out.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLove you, boo. Talk to you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLove you, kitten.\u201d</p><hr><p>\tShe felt like the car couldn\u2019t go fast enough. Of course, it had to obey traffic laws. But she missed him so much. She really didn\u2019t give a fuck. They pulled into the lot and her anxiousness skyrocketed. Her knee bounced with nervous energy. She pulled out her phone and messaged him one word: here.</p><p>\tOne of the set assistants helped her with her bags to Chris\u2019s trailer. She opened the door and was greeted but the best boy she knew. Dodger barked and wagged his tail. He jumped on his front legs but didn\u2019t jump on her. She dropped her bag then went to one knee.</p><p>\t\u201cBuddy! I missed you so much.\u201d He came to her, tail wagging so much and fast that his entire back half swayed with it. He licked her face and ears as she hugged his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cIs there anything I can get you?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d The assistant ducked out the door. She had just taken her shoes off and laid down on the bed when the door was thrown open. Dodger barked as Chris stepped in, still in the stealth suit costume. \u201cChris!\u201d She sat up and jumped into his arms as he strode to her. Their lips crashed together, his arm locking around her waist.</p><p>\t\u201cFuck, I missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI missed you too, baby.\u201d They spoke through kisses, not daring to pull away. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders. If this had been a movie, her leg would have popped up. But she needed the balance or else he would have pulled her off her feet. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you.\u201d He grinned at her, nuzzling his nose with hers before he kissed her again and again. Their tongues tangled together, chests getting tighter and tighter with need of oxygen. A soft knock on the door broke them apart&hellip;well, their kiss. They clung to each other like the other would disappear if they let go.\u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re needed back on set, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cFuck. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He reluctantly released her then kissed her one more time for the road. She watched him with an ache in her heart. She knew he\u2019d be back but goddamn, they just reunited. She sighed and flopped back on the bed. Despite their video play last night, she felt super anxious and she did not want to cum too quickly when they got back to the house he\u2019d leased for filming.</p><p>\tShe pulled up her gallery and found the perfect picture of him in the Stealth Suit. The same one he\u2019d just been wearing. She slipped her hand into her panties and found herself wet just from their kissing and the sight him in person in that fucking suit. She looked at the picture as she played with her clit. She was so high strung that it didn\u2019t take much effort. Fast, firm circles over the bud of nerves and she was tensing up and cumming so fast.</p><p>\t\u201cStarting without me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe squeaked and closed her legs. \u201cChris?\u201d He was leaning on the doorjamb, watching her. She hadn\u2019t heard him come in. \u201cI thought you were needed on set.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThe other Chris.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d She blushed under her already flushed cheeks. \u201cJust calming my nerves.\u201d She dropped her phone on the bed and rolled up onto her knees.</p><p>\t\u201cWhatcha looking at? Me, I hope.\u201d His joke made her smile fall.</p><p>\t\u201cOf course, you.\u201d He picked up her phone and raised both eyebrows. \u201cChris, I\u2019m sorry. I-\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok. It\u2019s still me under the costume.\u201d He shrugged and dropped her phone on the bed. \u201cThey\u2019re done with me for the day. What\u2019s say we grab some beers and a pizza and head back to house?\u201d He held her in his arms around her waist, smiling at her with his face so close.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d say yes to that.\u201d She leaned in and he closed the gap. Their lips met in a searing kiss and the tension she\u2019d just relieved came rushing back. Her clit throbbed and she clenched around nothing.</p><p>He moaned into the kiss before slowly pulling away. She chased after him, kissing him once before he squeezed her. \u201cLet me get out of this getup and get a shower and we\u2019ll do just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d She let him let her go.</p><p>\u201cAnd no starting without me again.\u201d He swatted her ass and made her squeak. He grinned and kissed her one more time before leaving her in the trailer again.</p><hr><p>Dinner had been eaten between orgasms. Carbs and protein and fat to keep them going. Chris\u2019s kisses tasted like beer and pepperoni. But she didn\u2019t care one fucking bit. Hers probably tasted the same. Exhaustion finally set in. She brushed her teeth and hair before sauntering nude across the hotel room. Chris\u2019s tongue rolled over his lips.</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so tired, we\u2019d be going again.\u201d</p><p>She straddled his waist, rocking her swollen slit along his cock. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d</p><p>His palms rubbed up her thighs and hips. \u201cSo have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning sex then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He pushed off the headboard and kissed her, holding her waist. His cock twitched underneath her. \u201cYou get settled. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She settled into the bed, pulling out her phone to check her notifications and messages. The water in the sink ran then shut off.</p><p>She glanced at the clock, noticing he\u2019d been in there awhile. \u201cBabe, are you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not have shaved off that stubble. I want the luscious beard between my thighs in a week.\u201d He laughed and she grinned.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s taking you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpatient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah? I wanna cuddle my Boo.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m coming out.\u201d Her brow scrunched in confusion. Why\u2026would he be announcing himself? She set her phone on the nightstand and sat on the edge of the bed. Her eyes widened at the silhouette from the bathroom light.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He stepped around the corner, swinging the shield in front of him. \u201cNo way! You got the whole suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the whole suit.\u201d She squealed and jumped up off the bed. He lowered the shield when she threw her arms around his shoulders. His free arm wrapped around her waist. \u201cWhatcha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing as always.\u201d She pecked his lips. He wrapped his other arm around her and held her naked body against the rough fabric of the suit. She moaned. He squeezed her tighter then dipped to suck and bite at her neck. \u201cOh Chris\u2026\u201d\u00a0Where the shield touched her skin, she shivered. Her nipples pulled tight and rubbed against the chest piece. She moaned again, not bothering to hide or fight the over-stimulation of her teats.</p><p>He hummed in her ear, breathing heavily against the curve of her neck. \u201cGot one more in you for the Captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod-fuck yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, baby, good.\u201d She bounced excitedly before crawling on the bed, exaggerating the sway of her ass for him. Her baby was an ass man, after all. His gloved hand swatted her ass. She squealed. \u201cCome here.\u201d He grabbed her ankle and pulled her back down the bed. She giggled. He held out his hand. She took and he pulled her up to stand. His arm wrapped around her waist and they swayed. His lips captured hers, holding her tight against his costumed body. She loved it. The rough fabric against her bare skin. Her arousal dripped down her thighs.</p><p>The gloved hands grabbed her tits then rolled her nipples between his fingers. She moaned, wanton and whorish. He grinned then reached around and slapped her ass hard. \u201cFuck. Chris.\u201d He pushed her against the wall. She lifted her leg to rub her foot along the boots. \u201cI can\u2019t help it, Chris. You are so fucking sexy in this uniform.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know. And I know you love it.\u201d He grabbed her thigh and lifted it higher, opening her up for him. Chris dropped kisses on her bare shoulder and collarbone. Her nails scraped the rubbery surface of the cowl.</p><p>\u201cOff.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and tugged the thing off. His fluffy hair stood up straight. Her fingers dove right into it, nails scratching his scalp lightly. He moaned, open-mouthed against her collarbone, then scraped it with his teeth. His gloved fingers swiped through her dripping cunt, pushing on her engorged clit. She groaned, her head thumping back on the wall. He lifted his hand between them. Both of them leaned in to lick her juices from the dark blue leather. Their tongues touched and glided along each other.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d He ripped the gloves off and tossed them to floor. \u201cHelp me.\u201d\u00a0He scrambled to unbuckle and zip the crotch of the suit. His cock strained against it. She groaned in appreciation and rubbed the bulging fabric over his dick. His hips bucked into her hand. \u201cNext time, I\u2019m sucking your dick in this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna argue.\u201d He laughed breathlessly. He managed to pull his dick out finally. He braced the head against her hole. \u201cYou still ready for me, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Her breath shook and she nodded. It was awkward at first but fuck was it hot. At first, Chris wasn\u2019t sure about this. But watching how into she was, feeling her slippery cunt quiver and clench around his pulsing cock, how she scrabbled with her nails on his shoulders. \u201cOh Chris, oh Chris, oh fuck!\u201d Never once did she slip and call him Capt or Steve, which would have made him stop. She called him Chris, over and over, breathless and screaming.</p><p>She lifted her leg to brace on the bed. Chris used his broad shoulders to hold her against the wall as he fucked the orgasm out of her. Her throat raw, she cried out his name one more time. He had to admit, he was into it too. And her enjoyment made it so much better. His thighs burned and shook before she came and he could finally let go of the failing grip he had on his release. When he felt her gush around him, his hips stuttered, her orgasm pulling him over into his.</p><p>He rested his forehead on hers, licking his lips and breathing through his nostrils. \u201cI was worried it would be awkward. I\u2019m so fucking glad it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, breathing heavily. Her legs shook but his body held her up. \u201cSooooo, do you think you could get one of the stealth suits?\u201d Chris startled, blinking then he burst out laughing and kissed her then again and again.<br/></p>",

Thus this work was born.</p><p>AO3 Link <b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18923443\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a></b></p>[[MORE]]<p>\tChris wasn\u2019t supposed to know. She didn\u2019t want him to be upset or weirded out by the fact that she sometimes masturbated to him in the Capt costume. But goddamn was the man sexy in it. Her favorite was the WWII costume. That soft brown leather jacket, that she knew was in his closet, and the booty shorts that accentuated his perfect ass. But she often had her fingers buried in her sopping cunt to the Stealth Suit of Sex.</p><p>\tShe curled around his pillow that didn\u2019t quite smell like him anymore and held the phone a little higher. \u201cWhat time does your flight land, babydoll?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c3pm.\u201d He looked so disappointed that she almost changed her flight right then and booked the Uber but she needed sleep. \u201cI can\u2019t get an earlier flight unless I fly out tonight. But then I\u2019ll be a tired, grouchy mess tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either. I want to enjoy my few days with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame, babe.\u201d He stretched out in the bed and the sound of skin on crisp sheets came through the speakers. \u201cI\u2019ll have a car waiting for you. You can come to the set or go to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tough choice.\u201d They smiled at each other. She checked the time. \u201cYou should be asleep, baby. You\u2019ve got early call in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to my girl. Sleep can wait. I\u2019ll snag a nap before lunch or something.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou need your rest, Chris. You\u2019re gonna see me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, but I wanna see you now.\u201d His voice dropped an octave, growing husky and deep. \u201cCan I see you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\tShe smirked. \u201cOf course.\u201d She bit her lip then bit the tip of her finger. Even though they\u2019d been together for a while, she still felt nervous asking him for the same even though he\u2019d never denied her. \u201cCan I see you?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou first, babygirl.\u201d Her belly dropped, bringing more wetness to her. She panned the camera down her body. The thin camisole nighty had ridden up her thighs. He licked his lips and palmed his cock in the loose boxers. \u201cAre you wearing panties, babe?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShow me.\u201d She let her legs fall open and held the camera at the best angle to show him her glistening pussy. \u201cSomeone\u2019s wet.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAlways for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\tHe hummed in appreciation. \u201cYou gonna pet that pretty pussy for me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGo head then.\u201d She propped the phone on a pillow between her legs so he could see her pussy in the screen. She slipped her fingers between her folds and rubbed up and down, not touching her clit just yet. \u201cPlay with your tits, babe.\u201d</p><p>\tShe pulled the neckline of the nightie down to expose her breasts. She palmed one then the other, squeezing and pinching the nipples. \u201cLike that, baby?\u201d</p><p>\tHe moaned. \u201cYes, just like that.\u201d</p><p>\tShe nestled into the pillows, opening her pussy up to him. Her clit peeked out of its hood as she rubbed around it. He licked his lips. \u201cLet me see you, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\tHe reclined against a headboard. He panned the camera down his bare chest to his lap and his long, thick cock standing straight up. The tip glistened with a drop of precum. She moaned. \u201cKeep making those sounds and I\u2019m gonna blow my load.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI can make plenty more.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh I know.\u201d He laid the phone on his belly. His face was hidden and he couldn\u2019t see her anymore, but she got a glorious view of him stroking his cock. She sighed, her lips parting. His stroking hand twisted at the tip.</p><p>\t\u201cFuck, I love watching your stroke your cock.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know you do, baby. My dirty girl.\u201d He picked up his phone and the image of his cock disappeared to be filled by his face. \u201cI need to see you cum.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOk, baby.\u201d She stroked her clit, looking him in the eyes through the screen. She pretended the handsome face between her legs was eating her pussy; his stroking her clit.</p><p>\t\u201cYou gonna cum for me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, Chris.\u201d Fuck, he loved when she said his name all breathy and wrecked like that. Her fingers rubbed faster, more pressure, faster, more pressure. Her legs trembled the closer she got. He moaned her name and fuck her whole goddamn life if it wasn\u2019t the sexiest sound she\u2019d ever heard. Her back bowed, string taught and she came with a deep, passionate moan.</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck, baby, that was beautiful. I wish I could taste your pussy right now.\u201d She whimpered. His image shook slightly with his vigorous stroking. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to feel you wrapped around my cock.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck yeah, I\u2019m gonna sink in you so deep you can\u2019t fucking breathe. Then I\u2019m gonna fuck the shit of you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, please, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShow me your ass.\u201d She rolled up onto her knees and tipped her ass up. She held one cheek open. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck, fuck, fuck, M\u2019gonna cum. Fuck!\u201d He groaned loud and long then fell to panting breaths. \u201cJesus Christ, I fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>\tShe giggled and brought the phone to her face, kissing him image. \u201cAnd I love you. Now, get some sleep, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI will. Gonna clean up and rack out.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLove you, boo. Talk to you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLove you, kitten.\u201d</p><hr><p>\tShe felt like the car couldn\u2019t go fast enough. Of course, it had to obey traffic laws. But she missed him so much. She really didn\u2019t give a fuck. They pulled into the lot and her anxiousness skyrocketed. Her knee bounced with nervous energy. She pulled out her phone and messaged him one word: here.</p><p>\tOne of the set assistants helped her with her bags to Chris\u2019s trailer. She opened the door and was greeted but the best boy she knew. Dodger barked and wagged his tail. He jumped on his front legs but didn\u2019t jump on her. She dropped her bag then went to one knee.</p><p>\t\u201cBuddy! I missed you so much.\u201d He came to her, tail wagging so much and fast that his entire back half swayed with it. He licked her face and ears as she hugged his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cIs there anything I can get you?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d The assistant ducked out the door. She had just taken her shoes off and laid down on the bed when the door was thrown open. Dodger barked as Chris stepped in, still in the stealth suit costume. \u201cChris!\u201d She sat up and jumped into his arms as he strode to her. Their lips crashed together, his arm locking around her waist.</p><p>\t\u201cFuck, I missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI missed you too, baby.\u201d They spoke through kisses, not daring to pull away. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders. If this had been a movie, her leg would have popped up. But she needed the balance or else he would have pulled her off her feet. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you.\u201d He grinned at her, nuzzling his nose with hers before he kissed her again and again. Their tongues tangled together, chests getting tighter and tighter with need of oxygen. A soft knock on the door broke them apart\u2026well, their kiss. They clung to each other like the other would disappear if they let go.\u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re needed back on set, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cFuck. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He reluctantly released her then kissed her one more time for the road. She watched him with an ache in her heart. She knew he\u2019d be back but goddamn, they just reunited. She sighed and flopped back on the bed. Despite their video play last night, she felt super anxious and she did not want to cum too quickly when they got back to the house he\u2019d leased for filming.</p><p>\tShe pulled up her gallery and found the perfect picture of him in the Stealth Suit. The same one he\u2019d just been wearing. She slipped her hand into her panties and found herself wet just from their kissing and the sight him in person in that fucking suit. She looked at the picture as she played with her clit. She was so high strung that it didn\u2019t take much effort. Fast, firm circles over the bud of nerves and she was tensing up and cumming so fast.</p><p>\t\u201cStarting without me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe squeaked and closed her legs. \u201cChris?\u201d He was leaning on the doorjamb, watching her. She hadn\u2019t heard him come in. \u201cI thought you were needed on set.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThe other Chris.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d She blushed under her already flushed cheeks. \u201cJust calming my nerves.\u201d She dropped her phone on the bed and rolled up onto her knees.</p><p>\t\u201cWhatcha looking at? Me, I hope.\u201d His joke made her smile fall.</p><p>\t\u201cOf course, you.\u201d He picked up her phone and raised both eyebrows. \u201cChris, I\u2019m sorry. I-\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok. It\u2019s still me under the costume.\u201d He shrugged and dropped her phone on the bed. \u201cThey\u2019re done with me for the day. What\u2019s say we grab some beers and a pizza and head back to house?\u201d He held her in his arms around her waist, smiling at her with his face so close.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d say yes to that.\u201d She leaned in and he closed the gap. Their lips met in a searing kiss and the tension she\u2019d just relieved came rushing back. Her clit throbbed and she clenched around nothing.</p><p>He moaned into the kiss before slowly pulling away. She chased after him, kissing him once before he squeezed her. \u201cLet me get out of this getup and get a shower and we\u2019ll do just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d She let him let her go.</p><p>\u201cAnd no starting without me again.\u201d He swatted her ass and made her squeak. He grinned and kissed her one more time before leaving her in the trailer again.</p><hr><p>Dinner had been eaten between orgasms. Carbs and protein and fat to keep them going. Chris\u2019s kisses tasted like beer and pepperoni. But she didn\u2019t care one fucking bit. Hers probably tasted the same. Exhaustion finally set in. She brushed her teeth and hair before sauntering nude across the hotel room. Chris\u2019s tongue rolled over his lips.</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so tired, we\u2019d be going again.\u201d</p><p>She straddled his waist, rocking her swollen slit along his cock. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d</p><p>His palms rubbed up her thighs and hips. \u201cSo have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning sex then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He pushed off the headboard and kissed her, holding her waist. His cock twitched underneath her. \u201cYou get settled. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She settled into the bed, pulling out her phone to check her notifications and messages. The water in the sink ran then shut off.</p><p>She glanced at the clock, noticing he\u2019d been in there awhile. \u201cBabe, are you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not have shaved off that stubble. I want the luscious beard between my thighs in a week.\u201d He laughed and she grinned.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s taking you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpatient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah? I wanna cuddle my Boo.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m coming out.\u201d Her brow scrunched in confusion. Why\u2026would he be announcing himself? She set her phone on the nightstand and sat on the edge of the bed. Her eyes widened at the silhouette from the bathroom light.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He stepped around the corner, swinging the shield in front of him. \u201cNo way! You got the whole suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the whole suit.\u201d She squealed and jumped up off the bed. He lowered the shield when she threw her arms around his shoulders. His free arm wrapped around her waist. \u201cWhatcha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing as always.\u201d She pecked his lips. He wrapped his other arm around her and held her naked body against the rough fabric of the suit. She moaned. He squeezed her tighter then dipped to suck and bite at her neck. \u201cOh Chris\u2026\u201d\u00a0Where the shield touched her skin, she shivered. Her nipples pulled tight and rubbed against the chest piece. She moaned again, not bothering to hide or fight the over-stimulation of her teats.</p><p>He hummed in her ear, breathing heavily against the curve of her neck. \u201cGot one more in you for the Captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod-fuck yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, baby, good.\u201d She bounced excitedly before crawling on the bed, exaggerating the sway of her ass for him. Her baby was an ass man, after all. His gloved hand swatted her ass. She squealed. \u201cCome here.\u201d He grabbed her ankle and pulled her back down the bed. She giggled. He held out his hand. She took and he pulled her up to stand. His arm wrapped around her waist and they swayed. His lips captured hers, holding her tight against his costumed body. She loved it. The rough fabric against her bare skin. Her arousal dripped down her thighs.</p><p>The gloved hands grabbed her tits then rolled her nipples between his fingers. She moaned, wanton and whorish. He grinned then reached around and slapped her ass hard. \u201cFuck. Chris.\u201d He pushed her against the wall. She lifted her leg to rub her foot along the boots. \u201cI can\u2019t help it, Chris. You are so fucking sexy in this uniform.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know. And I know you love it.\u201d He grabbed her thigh and lifted it higher, opening her up for him. Chris dropped kisses on her bare shoulder and collarbone. Her nails scraped the rubbery surface of the cowl.</p><p>\u201cOff.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and tugged the thing off. His fluffy hair stood up straight. Her fingers dove right into it, nails scratching his scalp lightly. He moaned, open-mouthed against her collarbone, then scraped it with his teeth. His gloved fingers swiped through her dripping cunt, pushing on her engorged clit. She groaned, her head thumping back on the wall. He lifted his hand between them. Both of them leaned in to lick her juices from the dark blue leather. Their tongues touched and glided along each other.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d He ripped the gloves off and tossed them to floor. \u201cHelp me.\u201d\u00a0He scrambled to unbuckle and zip the crotch of the suit. His cock strained against it. She groaned in appreciation and rubbed the bulging fabric over his dick. His hips bucked into her hand. \u201cNext time, I\u2019m sucking your dick in this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna argue.\u201d He laughed breathlessly. He managed to pull his dick out finally. He braced the head against her hole. \u201cYou still ready for me, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Her breath shook and she nodded. It was awkward at first but fuck was it hot. At first, Chris wasn\u2019t sure about this. But watching how into she was, feeling her slippery cunt quiver and clench around his pulsing cock, how she scrabbled with her nails on his shoulders. \u201cOh Chris, oh Chris, oh fuck!\u201d Never once did she slip and call him Capt or Steve, which would have made him stop. She called him Chris, over and over, breathless and screaming.</p><p>She lifted her leg to brace on the bed. Chris used his broad shoulders to hold her against the wall as he fucked the orgasm out of her. Her throat raw, she cried out his name one more time. He had to admit, he was into it too. And her enjoyment made it so much better. His thighs burned and shook before she came and he could finally let go of the failing grip he had on his release. When he felt her gush around him, his hips stuttered, her orgasm pulling him over into his.</p><p>He rested his forehead on hers, licking his lips and breathing through his nostrils. \u201cI was worried it would be awkward. I\u2019m so fucking glad it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, breathing heavily. Her legs shook but his body held her up. \u201cSooooo, do you think you could get one of the stealth suits?\u201d Chris startled, blinking then he burst out laughing and kissed her then again and again.<br></p></p>",

You\u2019re gonna see me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, but I wanna see you now.\u201d His voice dropped an octave, growing husky and deep. \u201cCan I see you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\tShe smirked. \u201cOf course.\u201d She bit her lip then bit the tip of her finger. Even though they\u2019d been together for a while, she still felt nervous asking him for the same even though he\u2019d never denied her. \u201cCan I see you?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou first, babygirl.\u201d Her belly dropped, bringing more wetness to her. She panned the camera down her body. The thin camisole nighty had ridden up her thighs. He licked his lips and palmed his cock in the loose boxers. \u201cAre you wearing panties, babe?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShow me.\u201d She let her legs fall open and held the camera at the best angle to show him her glistening pussy. \u201cSomeone\u2019s wet.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAlways for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\tHe hummed in appreciation. \u201cYou gonna pet that pretty pussy for me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGo head then.\u201d She propped the phone on a pillow between her legs so he could see her pussy in the screen. She slipped her fingers between her folds and rubbed up and down, not touching her clit just yet. \u201cPlay with your tits, babe.\u201d</p><p>\tShe pulled the neckline of the nightie down to expose her breasts. She palmed one then the other, squeezing and pinching the nipples. \u201cLike that, baby?\u201d</p><p>\tHe moaned. \u201cYes, just like that.\u201d</p><p>\tShe nestled into the pillows, opening her pussy up to him. Her clit peeked out of its hood as she rubbed around it. He licked his lips. \u201cLet me see you, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\tHe reclined against a headboard. He panned the camera down his bare chest to his lap and his long, thick cock standing straight up. The tip glistened with a drop of precum. She moaned. \u201cKeep making those sounds and I\u2019m gonna blow my load.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI can make plenty more.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh I know.\u201d He laid the phone on his belly. His face was hidden and he couldn\u2019t see her anymore, but she got a glorious view of him stroking his cock. She sighed, her lips parting. His stroking hand twisted at the tip.</p><p>\t\u201cFuck, I love watching your stroke your cock.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know you do, baby. My dirty girl.\u201d He picked up his phone and the image of his cock disappeared to be filled by his face. \u201cI need to see you cum.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOk, baby.\u201d She stroked her clit, looking him in the eyes through the screen. She pretended the handsome face between her legs was eating her pussy; his stroking her clit.</p><p>\t\u201cYou gonna cum for me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, Chris.\u201d Fuck, he loved when she said his name all breathy and wrecked like that. Her fingers rubbed faster, more pressure, faster, more pressure. Her legs trembled the closer she got. He moaned her name and fuck her whole goddamn life if it wasn\u2019t the sexiest sound she\u2019d ever heard. Her back bowed, string taught and she came with a deep, passionate moan.</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck, baby, that was beautiful. I wish I could taste your pussy right now.\u201d She whimpered. His image shook slightly with his vigorous stroking. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to feel you wrapped around my cock.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck yeah, I\u2019m gonna sink in you so deep you can\u2019t fucking breathe. Then I\u2019m gonna fuck the shit of you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, please, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShow me your ass.\u201d She rolled up onto her knees and tipped her ass up. She held one cheek open. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh fuck, fuck, fuck, M\u2019gonna cum. Fuck!\u201d He groaned loud and long then fell to panting breaths. \u201cJesus Christ, I fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>\tShe giggled and brought the phone to her face, kissing him image. \u201cAnd I love you. Now, get some sleep, baby.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI will. Gonna clean up and rack out.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLove you, boo. Talk to you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLove you, kitten.\u201d</p><hr><p>\tShe felt like the car couldn\u2019t go fast enough. Of course, it had to obey traffic laws. But she missed him so much. She really didn\u2019t give a fuck. They pulled into the lot and her anxiousness skyrocketed. Her knee bounced with nervous energy. She pulled out her phone and messaged him one word: here.</p><p>\tOne of the set assistants helped her with her bags to Chris\u2019s trailer. She opened the door and was greeted but the best boy she knew. Dodger barked and wagged his tail. He jumped on his front legs but didn\u2019t jump on her. She dropped her bag then went to one knee.</p><p>\t\u201cBuddy! I missed you so much.\u201d He came to her, tail wagging so much and fast that his entire back half swayed with it. He licked her face and ears as she hugged his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cIs there anything I can get you?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d The assistant ducked out the door. She had just taken her shoes off and laid down on the bed when the door was thrown open. Dodger barked as Chris stepped in, still in the stealth suit costume. \u201cChris!\u201d She sat up and jumped into his arms as he strode to her. Their lips crashed together, his arm locking around her waist.</p><p>\t\u201cFuck, I missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI missed you too, baby.\u201d They spoke through kisses, not daring to pull away. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders. If this had been a movie, her leg would have popped up. But she needed the balance or else he would have pulled her off her feet. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you.\u201d He grinned at her, nuzzling his nose with hers before he kissed her again and again. Their tongues tangled together, chests getting tighter and tighter with need of oxygen. A soft knock on the door broke them apart\u2026well, their kiss. They clung to each other like the other would disappear if they let go.\u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re needed back on set, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cFuck. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He reluctantly released her then kissed her one more time for the road. She watched him with an ache in her heart. She knew he\u2019d be back but goddamn, they just reunited. She sighed and flopped back on the bed. Despite their video play last night, she felt super anxious and she did not want to cum too quickly when they got back to the house he\u2019d leased for filming.</p><p>\tShe pulled up her gallery and found the perfect picture of him in the Stealth Suit. The same one he\u2019d just been wearing. She slipped her hand into her panties and found herself wet just from their kissing and the sight him in person in that fucking suit. She looked at the picture as she played with her clit. She was so high strung that it didn\u2019t take much effort. Fast, firm circles over the bud of nerves and she was tensing up and cumming so fast.</p><p>\t\u201cStarting without me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe squeaked and closed her legs. \u201cChris?\u201d He was leaning on the doorjamb, watching her. She hadn\u2019t heard him come in. \u201cI thought you were needed on set.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThe other Chris.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d She blushed under her already flushed cheeks. \u201cJust calming my nerves.\u201d She dropped her phone on the bed and rolled up onto her knees.</p><p>\t\u201cWhatcha looking at? Me, I hope.\u201d His joke made her smile fall.</p><p>\t\u201cOf course, you.\u201d He picked up her phone and raised both eyebrows. \u201cChris, I\u2019m sorry. I-\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok. It\u2019s still me under the costume.\u201d He shrugged and dropped her phone on the bed. \u201cThey\u2019re done with me for the day. What\u2019s say we grab some beers and a pizza and head back to house?\u201d He held her in his arms around her waist, smiling at her with his face so close.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d say yes to that.\u201d She leaned in and he closed the gap. Their lips met in a searing kiss and the tension she\u2019d just relieved came rushing back. Her clit throbbed and she clenched around nothing.</p><p>He moaned into the kiss before slowly pulling away. She chased after him, kissing him once before he squeezed her. \u201cLet me get out of this getup and get a shower and we\u2019ll do just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d She let him let her go.</p><p>\u201cAnd no starting without me again.\u201d He swatted her ass and made her squeak. He grinned and kissed her one more time before leaving her in the trailer again.</p><hr><p>Dinner had been eaten between orgasms. Carbs and protein and fat to keep them going. Chris\u2019s kisses tasted like beer and pepperoni. But she didn\u2019t care one fucking bit. Hers probably tasted the same. Exhaustion finally set in. She brushed her teeth and hair before sauntering nude across the hotel room. Chris\u2019s tongue rolled over his lips.</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so tired, we\u2019d be going again.\u201d</p><p>She straddled his waist, rocking her swollen slit along his cock. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d</p><p>His palms rubbed up her thighs and hips. \u201cSo have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning sex then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He pushed off the headboard and kissed her, holding her waist. His cock twitched underneath her. \u201cYou get settled. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She settled into the bed, pulling out her phone to check her notifications and messages. The water in the sink ran then shut off.</p><p>She glanced at the clock, noticing he\u2019d been in there awhile. \u201cBabe, are you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not have shaved off that stubble. I want the luscious beard between my thighs in a week.\u201d He laughed and she grinned.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s taking you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpatient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah? I wanna cuddle my Boo.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m coming out.\u201d Her brow scrunched in confusion. Why\u2026would he be announcing himself? She set her phone on the nightstand and sat on the edge of the bed. Her eyes widened at the silhouette from the bathroom light.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He stepped around the corner, swinging the shield in front of him. \u201cNo way! You got the whole suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the whole suit.\u201d She squealed and jumped up off the bed. He lowered the shield when she threw her arms around his shoulders. His free arm wrapped around her waist. \u201cWhatcha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing as always.\u201d She pecked his lips. He wrapped his other arm around her and held her naked body against the rough fabric of the suit. She moaned. He squeezed her tighter then dipped to suck and bite at her neck. \u201cOh Chris\u2026\u201d\u00a0Where the shield touched her skin, she shivered. Her nipples pulled tight and rubbed against the chest piece. She moaned again, not bothering to hide or fight the over-stimulation of her teats.</p><p>He hummed in her ear, breathing heavily against the curve of her neck. \u201cGot one more in you for the Captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod-fuck yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, baby, good.\u201d She bounced excitedly before crawling on the bed, exaggerating the sway of her ass for him. Her baby was an ass man, after all. His gloved hand swatted her ass. She squealed. \u201cCome here.\u201d He grabbed her ankle and pulled her back down the bed. She giggled. He held out his hand. She took and he pulled her up to stand. His arm wrapped around her waist and they swayed. His lips captured hers, holding her tight against his costumed body. She loved it. The rough fabric against her bare skin. Her arousal dripped down her thighs.</p><p>The gloved hands grabbed her tits then rolled her nipples between his fingers. She moaned, wanton and whorish. He grinned then reached around and slapped her ass hard. \u201cFuck. Chris.\u201d He pushed her against the wall. She lifted her leg to rub her foot along the boots. \u201cI can\u2019t help it, Chris. You are so fucking sexy in this uniform.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know. And I know you love it.\u201d He grabbed her thigh and lifted it higher, opening her up for him. Chris dropped kisses on her bare shoulder and collarbone. Her nails scraped the rubbery surface of the cowl.</p><p>\u201cOff.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and tugged the thing off. His fluffy hair stood up straight. Her fingers dove right into it, nails scratching his scalp lightly. He moaned, open-mouthed against her collarbone, then scraped it with his teeth. His gloved fingers swiped through her dripping cunt, pushing on her engorged clit. She groaned, her head thumping back on the wall. He lifted his hand between them. Both of them leaned in to lick her juices from the dark blue leather. Their tongues touched and glided along each other.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d He ripped the gloves off and tossed them to floor. \u201cHelp me.\u201d\u00a0He scrambled to unbuckle and zip the crotch of the suit. His cock strained against it. She groaned in appreciation and rubbed the bulging fabric over his dick. His hips bucked into her hand. \u201cNext time, I\u2019m sucking your dick in this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna argue.\u201d He laughed breathlessly. He managed to pull his dick out finally. He braced the head against her hole. \u201cYou still ready for me, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Her breath shook and she nodded. It was awkward at first but fuck was it hot. At first, Chris wasn\u2019t sure about this. But watching how into she was, feeling her slippery cunt quiver and clench around his pulsing cock, how she scrabbled with her nails on his shoulders. \u201cOh Chris, oh Chris, oh fuck!\u201d Never once did she slip and call him Capt or Steve, which would have made him stop. She called him Chris, over and over, breathless and screaming.</p><p>She lifted her leg to brace on the bed. Chris used his broad shoulders to hold her against the wall as he fucked the orgasm out of her. Her throat raw, she cried out his name one more time. He had to admit, he was into it too. And her enjoyment made it so much better. His thighs burned and shook before she came and he could finally let go of the failing grip he had on his release. When he felt her gush around him, his hips stuttered, her orgasm pulling him over into his.</p><p>He rested his forehead on hers, licking his lips and breathing through his nostrils. \u201cI was worried it would be awkward. I\u2019m so fucking glad it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, breathing heavily. Her legs shook but his body held her up. \u201cSooooo, do you think you could get one of the stealth suits?\u201d Chris startled, blinking then he burst out laughing and kissed her then again and again.<br></p></p>",

Fuck!&rdquo; He groaned loud and long then fell to panting breaths. &ldquo;Jesus Christ, I fucking love you.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe giggled and brought the phone to her face, kissing him image. &ldquo;And I love you. Now, get some sleep, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I will. Gonna clean up and rack out.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Love you, boo. Talk to you in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Love you, kitten.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>\tShe felt like the car couldn&rsquo;t go fast enough. Of course, it had to obey traffic laws. But she missed him so much. She really didn&rsquo;t give a fuck. They pulled into the lot and her anxiousness skyrocketed. Her knee bounced with nervous energy. She pulled out her phone and messaged him one word: here.</p><p>\tOne of the set assistants helped her with her bags to Chris&rsquo;s trailer. She opened the door and was greeted but the best boy she knew. Dodger barked and wagged his tail. He jumped on his front legs but didn&rsquo;t jump on her. She dropped her bag then went to one knee.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Buddy! I missed you so much.&rdquo; He came to her, tail wagging so much and fast that his entire back half swayed with it. He licked her face and ears as she hugged his neck.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Is there anything I can get you?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo; The assistant ducked out the door. She had just taken her shoes off and laid down on the bed when the door was thrown open. Dodger barked as Chris stepped in, still in the stealth suit costume. &ldquo;Chris!&rdquo; She sat up and jumped into his arms as he strode to her. Their lips crashed together, his arm locking around her waist.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Fuck, I missed you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I missed you too, baby.&rdquo; They spoke through kisses, not daring to pull away. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders. If this had been a movie, her leg would have popped up. But she needed the balance or else he would have pulled her off her feet. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; He grinned at her, nuzzling his nose with hers before he kissed her again and again. Their tongues tangled together, chests getting tighter and tighter with need of oxygen. A soft knock on the door broke them apart&hellip;well, their kiss. They clung to each other like the other would disappear if they let go.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re needed back on set, Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Fuck. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; He reluctantly released her then kissed her one more time for the road. She watched him with an ache in her heart. She knew he&rsquo;d be back but goddamn, they just reunited. She sighed and flopped back on the bed. Despite their video play last night, she felt super anxious and she did not want to cum too quickly when they got back to the house he&rsquo;d leased for filming.</p><p>\tShe pulled up her gallery and found the perfect picture of him in the Stealth Suit. The same one he&rsquo;d just been wearing. She slipped her hand into her panties and found herself wet just from their kissing and the sight him in person in that fucking suit. She looked at the picture as she played with her clit. She was so high strung that it didn&rsquo;t take much effort. Fast, firm circles over the bud of nerves and she was tensing up and cumming so fast.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Starting without me?&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe squeaked and closed her legs. &ldquo;Chris?&rdquo; He was leaning on the doorjamb, watching her. She hadn&rsquo;t heard him come in. &ldquo;I thought you were needed on set.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;The other Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; She blushed under her already flushed cheeks. &ldquo;Just calming my nerves.&rdquo; She dropped her phone on the bed and rolled up onto her knees.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Whatcha looking at? Me, I hope.&rdquo; His joke made her smile fall.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Of course, you.&rdquo; He picked up her phone and raised both eyebrows. &ldquo;Chris, I&rsquo;m sorry. I-&ldquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. It&rsquo;s still me under the costume.&rdquo; He shrugged and dropped her phone on the bed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re done with me for the day. What&rsquo;s say we grab some beers and a pizza and head back to house?&rdquo; He held her in his arms around her waist, smiling at her with his face so close.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say yes to that.&rdquo; She leaned in and he closed the gap. Their lips met in a searing kiss and the tension she&rsquo;d just relieved came rushing back. Her clit throbbed and she clenched around nothing.</p><p>He moaned into the kiss before slowly pulling away. She chased after him, kissing him once before he squeezed her. &ldquo;Let me get out of this getup and get a shower and we&rsquo;ll do just that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; She let him let her go.</p><p>&ldquo;And no starting without me again.&rdquo; He swatted her ass and made her squeak. He grinned and kissed her one more time before leaving her in the trailer again.</p><hr /><p>Dinner had been eaten between orgasms. Carbs and protein and fat to keep them going. Chris&rsquo;s kisses tasted like beer and pepperoni. But she didn&rsquo;t care one fucking bit. Hers probably tasted the same. Exhaustion finally set in. She brushed her teeth and hair before sauntering nude across the hotel room. Chris&rsquo;s tongue rolled over his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t so tired, we&rsquo;d be going again.&rdquo;</p><p>She straddled his waist, rocking her swollen slit along his cock. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a long day.&rdquo;</p><p>His palms rubbed up her thighs and hips. &ldquo;So have you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Morning sex then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He pushed off the headboard and kissed her, holding her waist. His cock twitched underneath her. &ldquo;You get settled. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; She settled into the bed, pulling out her phone to check her notifications and messages. The water in the sink ran then shut off.</p><p>She glanced at the clock, noticing he&rsquo;d been in there awhile. &ldquo;Babe, are you ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;ll be right out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You better not have shaved off that stubble. I want the luscious beard between my thighs in a week.&rdquo; He laughed and she grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t shave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s taking you so long?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impatient?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah? I wanna cuddle my Boo.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed again. &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m coming out.&rdquo; Her brow scrunched in confusion. Why&hellip;would he be announcing himself? She set her phone on the nightstand and sat on the edge of the bed. Her eyes widened at the silhouette from the bathroom light.</p><p>&ldquo;No way.&rdquo; He stepped around the corner, swinging the shield in front of him. &ldquo;No way! You got the whole suit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got the whole suit.&rdquo; She squealed and jumped up off the bed. He lowered the shield when she threw her arms around his shoulders. His free arm wrapped around her waist. &ldquo;Whatcha think?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Amazing as always.&rdquo; She pecked his lips. He wrapped his other arm around her and held her naked body against the rough fabric of the suit. She moaned. He squeezed her tighter then dipped to suck and bite at her neck. &ldquo;Oh Chris&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;Where the shield touched her skin, she shivered. Her nipples pulled tight and rubbed against the chest piece. She moaned again, not bothering to hide or fight the over-stimulation of her teats.</p><p>He hummed in her ear, breathing heavily against the curve of her neck. &ldquo;Got one more in you for the Captain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God-fuck yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, baby, good.&rdquo; She bounced excitedly before crawling on the bed, exaggerating the sway of her ass for him. Her baby was an ass man, after all. His gloved hand swatted her ass. She squealed. &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; He grabbed her ankle and pulled her back down the bed. She giggled. He held out his hand. She took and he pulled her up to stand. His arm wrapped around her waist and they swayed. His lips captured hers, holding her tight against his costumed body. She loved it. The rough fabric against her bare skin. Her arousal dripped down her thighs.</p><p>The gloved hands grabbed her tits then rolled her nipples between his fingers. She moaned, wanton and whorish. He grinned then reached around and slapped her ass hard. &ldquo;Fuck. Chris.&rdquo; He pushed her against the wall. She lifted her leg to rub her foot along the boots. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Chris. You are so fucking sexy in this uniform.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled. &ldquo;I know. And I know you love it.&rdquo; He grabbed her thigh and lifted it higher, opening her up for him. Chris dropped kisses on her bare shoulder and collarbone. Her nails scraped the rubbery surface of the cowl.</p><p>&ldquo;Off.&rdquo;</p><p>He reached up and tugged the thing off. His fluffy hair stood up straight. Her fingers dove right into it, nails scratching his scalp lightly. He moaned, open-mouthed against her collarbone, then scraped it with his teeth. His gloved fingers swiped through her dripping cunt, pushing on her engorged clit. She groaned, her head thumping back on the wall. He lifted his hand between them. Both of them leaned in to lick her juices from the dark blue leather. Their tongues touched and glided along each other.</p><p>&ldquo;I fucking love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, baby.&rdquo; He ripped the gloves off and tossed them to floor. &ldquo;Help me.&rdquo;&nbsp;He scrambled to unbuckle and zip the crotch of the suit. His cock strained against it. She groaned in appreciation and rubbed the bulging fabric over his dick. His hips bucked into her hand. &ldquo;Next time, I&rsquo;m sucking your dick in this thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna argue.&rdquo; He laughed breathlessly. He managed to pull his dick out finally. He braced the head against her hole. &ldquo;You still ready for me, baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah.&rdquo; Her breath shook and she nodded. It was awkward at first but fuck was it hot. At first, Chris wasn&rsquo;t sure about this. But watching how into she was, feeling her slippery cunt quiver and clench around his pulsing cock, how she scrabbled with her nails on his shoulders. &ldquo;Oh Chris, oh Chris, oh fuck!&rdquo; Never once did she slip and call him Capt or Steve, which would have made him stop. She called him Chris, over and over, breathless and screaming.</p><p>She lifted her leg to brace on the bed. Chris used his broad shoulders to hold her against the wall as he fucked the orgasm out of her. Her throat raw, she cried out his name one more time. He had to admit, he was into it too. And her enjoyment made it so much better. His thighs burned and shook before she came and he could finally let go of the failing grip he had on his release. When he felt her gush around him, his hips stuttered, her orgasm pulling him over into his.</p><p>He rested his forehead on hers, licking his lips and breathing through his nostrils. &ldquo;I was worried it would be awkward. I&rsquo;m so fucking glad it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled, breathing heavily. Her legs shook but his body held her up. &ldquo;Sooooo, do you think you could get one of the stealth suits?&rdquo; Chris startled, blinking then he burst out laughing and kissed her then again and again.<br /></p></p>",
