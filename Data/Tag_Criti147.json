So here goes an overly complex self-indulgent analysis of halfling racial traits vs goblin racial traits\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m gonna assume she had the same <i>base</i> stats (before mods) as a halfling and a goblin, because the reincarnate spell (which has pretty much been confirmed) says this:\u00a0<br/>\u201cIt retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.\u201d<br/>Which I\u2019m reading as: class and base stats stay the same <strike>(give me rogue!Veth)</strike> but the racial bonuses reset and the racial features change.</p><p>To start, let\u2019s look at the halfling traits. We don\u2019t know which variant of halfing she was, but all halflings get this:</p><blockquote><p>Brave: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p></blockquote><p>Nott the Brave lost Brave when she became a goblin. She is no longer Brave. Also she loses her advantage on saving throws against being frightened, which is interesting when you think about how the one benefit of her alcoholic intake is that she becomes <i>immune</i> to fear.</p><p>All halflings also get +2 dex, 25 movement, Lucky (reroll nat 1\u2032s <strike>Nott does have the second-highest nat 1 count of tM9</strike>), and Halfling Nimbleness, which lets them move through spaces with larger creatures.\u00a0</p><p>But let\u2019s say she was a Lightfoot halfling.
