The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a></p><p><b>Chapter Five</b></p><p>On Friday morning, after breakfast has been cleared, Mona is going over all of the things Dan needs to stay on top of over the weekend, when someone knocks on the front door. Both of them turn to the noise, obviously startled. They\u2019re 7,000 feet up the side of a mountain. Visitors aren\u2019t a frequent occurrence.<br/></p><p>In the next moment, Mona gathers herself, smooths down her jacket lapels and goes to answer the door. As soon as she opens it, Kaspar bursts through, brandishing a pair of electric blue skis, a smallish parcel under his arm, and a pile of letters secured with string. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cMy gorgeous Mona!\u201d he exclaims, dropping everything onto the side-table nearby in order to pull her into a hug. He dwarfs her small frame with his big, beefy arms, but she doesn\u2019t struggle, patting Kaspar politely on the shoulder and waiting for him to have had his fill. \u201cYour eyes, they shine brighter than the sun glinting off the mountain snow. Your skin is the colour of a young fawn-\u201d </p><p>\u201cG-good morning, Kaspar,\u201d Mona stammers out quickly once she\u2019s been released. Her cheeks are now tinged a deep pink. \u201cShall I take these?\u201d </p><p>She reaches past him to pluck the bundle of letters from the table. \u201cMy beauty,\u201d Kaspar says, catching her by the arm as she attempts to grapple with the skis. \u201cAllow me to lift your burdens. I will take care of everything. I can read you each letter one by one-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of reading my own mail, Kaspar,\u201d Mona interrupts sternly, though her cheeks are practically aflame at this point. Dan watches on in amusement, pretending to be busy on the reception computer.\u00a0\u201cThough I would appreciate your help taking the skis up to the top floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy angel, if you asked I would let you sail down the mountain on by back,\u201d Kaspar cries, to which Mona rolls her eyes, but does let out a tiny smile.\u00a0</p><p>Kaspar lifts the skis onto his shoulder, then reaches for the parcel. Dan jumps to his feet so abruptly that he knocks the computer mouse off the desk. Mona and Kaspar turn in surprise at the sound.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the other parcel,\u201d Dan blurts,\u00a0catching the mouse from where it swings from its cord, and placing it carefully back on the mousepad.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s for Mr Novokoric, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Mona plucks the package from Kaspar and studies the name on the label, frowning. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe&hellip; mentioned that he\u2019d ordered a new phone.\u201d</p><p>Something about this response makes Mona\u2019s\u00a0eyes widen. \u201cHe\u2026 told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan says, that niggling sense that he\u2019s missing something rearing its head once again. \u201cIs that strange?\u201d </p><p>Mona shrugs, but gives him a once over. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine. Take the package.\u00a0 You can lead the way to Mr Novokoric\u2019s room. Show Kaspar where it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle Dan, you are my sherpa,\u201d Kaspar declares, grinning. Armed with the skis resting over his broad shoulder, Kaspar appears rather menacing. \u201cLead on.\u201d</p><p>Ducking as Kaspar turns to and fro, expressively admiring the lobby interior as Mona blushes and accepts compliments, Dan goes to collect the package from the table. Mona summons the courage to ask Kaspar whether he\u2019d like a coffee before he leaves again, and Kaspar\u2019s enthusiasm for this nearly severs Dan\u2019s neck from his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>He scurries quickly towards the stairs, assuming that Kaspar will follow once he\u2019s done fawning over the manager. As they begin the ascent, Kaspar prattles on about how the blizzard that was forecast for today is nowhere to be seen, and that Kaspar himself knows far more than \u2018<i>those baboons with their balloons and barometers</i>\u2019 ever will. Dan just nods along, unable to get a word in edgeways even if he were so inclined.\u00a0</p><p>In truth, Dan\u2019s rather glad of Kaspar\u2019s non-stop chatter, as he himself is too busy trying to understand why he\u2019s voluntarily hurled himself into this situation. On most days, he barely has to converse with Phil at all, and that\u2019s just fine. The less they speak to one another, the less chance there is for Dan\u2019s day to be ruined by whatever insult Phil lets slip as casually as Kaspar comments on the weather. Now, for some reason, he\u2019s willingly placed himself in the line of fire. For the life of him, Dan cannot understand it, but something about watching Mona and Kaspar had shaken free an urgent desire to see Phil. To deliver the first bit of good news the man has probably gotten in quite some time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think now we are another thousand feet up!\u201d Kaspar jokes as they emerge on the top floor landing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Dan manages a polite titter in response.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s room eight,\u201d he says, gesturing to Phil\u2019s door.\u00a0</p><p>The hallway is silent apart from Dan and Kaspar\u2019s breathing from the climb. Kaspar has an excuse, given that he\u2019s lugging enormous skis; Dan\u2019s parcel isn\u2019t that heavy, but he is incredibly unfit. Part of Dan wishes he could take a moment to get his breath back before knocking on Phil\u2019s door, but explaining this would probably only confuse Kaspar, so he decides to just go for it.\u00a0</p><p>He knocks, just as Kaspar begins to sing breathily - something Swiss and jaunty that Dan is pretty sure is out of tune. The door opens after a while, and Phil stands there, his shirt half-buttoned, his hair ruffled and messy. He looks like he\u2019s just been ravished in the enormous four-poster bed Dan can see behind him. </p><p>\u201cWe- our- Kaspar- um, we have a- packages for- um. Here.\u201d Mostly to stop his mouth from doing whatever it\u2019s doing, Dan pushes the box into Phil\u2019s hands.</p><p>Phil gives him a curious look, then moves his attention to Kaspar and the skis. \u201cOh, awesome,\u201d he says, then seems to remember himself. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s excellent, Kaspar. Thank you for bringing those up.\u201d </p><p>He takes a step to one side in the doorway, letting a still-singing Kaspar swan through into Phil\u2019s suite. Even from his limited viewpoint, it\u2019s clear to Dan that this room is three times the size of his own next door, and far more luxurious. There\u2019s a chaise longue, for one thing, and a window seat, and a huge wall-mounted television. </p><p>\u201cAnd where would you like me to put these, Philly?\u201d Kaspar asks in his loud, jolly voice.\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot towards the ceiling. <i>Philly? \u00a0</i></p><p>It might be Dan\u2019s imagination, but he thinks he sees a light blush skimming atop Phil\u2019s high cheekbones. \u201cIn the cupboard, if you don\u2019t mind, Kaspar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kaspar replies, springing out of sight somewhere deeper into the suite. </p><p>Phil turns back to Dan, then looks down at the box he\u2019s been given. \u201cThanks for this,\u201d he says, unexpectedly. \u201cI\u2019m going mad without a phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem. I mean, Mona ordered it, I\u2019m just the delivery boy.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, and a painful silence falls. Dan, having always detested awkwardness, cannot let it just sit on their shoulders, so for some reason says, \u201ctry not to chuck this one off a mountain!\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s a joke, of course, but Phil doesn\u2019t laugh. Instead, his lips press together, and Dan remembers - <i>idiot, idiot, idiot</i> - that the information about what happened to Phil\u2019s previous phone was gleaned from eavesdropping on a phone call he had with his husband. </p><p>\u201cI hear we\u2019re going to be alone over the next few days,\u201d Phil says, swiftly changing the subject, to Dan\u2019s relief. </p><p>\u201cMona and Louise are away, yeah,\u201d Dan says, not bothering to hide the dread in his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s another couple of guests, but yeah it\u2019ll just be me in terms of staff-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the other couple cancelled?\u201d </p><p>Dan freezes, staring at Phil as a gelatinous glob of horror trickles down his spine. \u201cW-what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was speaking with Mona last night,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI think she said the other guests called to say they were too worried about the forecast blizzard.\u201d </p><p>Just then, Kaspar re-emerges, arms empty of skis, beaming away as he squeezes past them back through the door. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your day, Philly. Come now, little Dan, let us leave him to his duties.\u201d </p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches when he hears the phrase \u2018little Dan\u2019, which is mildly embarrassing, but Dan is too boggled to feel it too deeply. Instead, Dan nods vaguely at Phil, who says nothing more, and then follows Kaspar back down the hall, past his own room, towards the stairs. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWell of course I was going to mention it, Dan,\u201d Mona says distractedly, taking the coffee Dan made - courtesy of Louise\u2019s careful tuition - and placing it down in front of Kaspar, who takes her hand and kisses it. She pulls free of him quickly, flushing for the umpteenth time, and turns back to Dan. \u201cHonestly, I thought you\u2019d be relieved! Now you won\u2019t have to worry about keeping guests happy. You just have to make sure the place doesn\u2019t blow up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re forgetting one guest,\u201d Dan can\u2019t help but point out. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me alone here with- with-\u00a0<i>him</i>!\u201d </p><p>Louise\u2019s snicker echoes through the kitchen behind him, and Dan makes a mental note to \u2018accidentally\u2019 spray her with coffee during their next lesson. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, exactly?\u201d Mona asks, a touch impatiently. Her eyes are flicking back towards Kaspar, who is patting the chair beside his emphatically. \u201cLouise seems to be under the impression that you and Mr Novokoric had straightened things out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe apologised to Dan very nicely for upsetting him!\u201d Louise calls unhelpfully from somewhere behind him. </p><p>Mona gives Dan a satisfied smile. \u201cThere, nothing to worry about then. Besides, I doubt you\u2019ll see much of him. Of course you\u2019ll need to deliver his meals to his room if he wants them. Louise can show you what needs doing with that. But apart from that, the man barely ever makes a peep.\u201d </p><p>Begrudgingly, Dan nods, and Mona turns from him, making her way back over to Kaspar\u2019s table. Dan watches her being flirted with for a few minutes, bemoaning his decision to take this bloody job, which has landed him a whole two days with a spoiled member of Swiss Royalty. His stomach flips as he considers the length of time stretching ahead, with just the two of them, up here, all alone. Then, he sighs, heads back into the kitchen, and calls for Louise to come and show him how to make a macchiato again. </p><p>*</p><p>Kaspar stays until the evening, with the excuse that he might as well stay until it\u2019s time to escort Mona and Louise down the mountain. Louise is leaving for the weekend in order to see her daughter, Pearl, who lives with her father in Sussex, England. The nature of Louise\u2019s job, along with certain court sentences that Dan doesn\u2019t have the heart to ask about yet, means that she only gets to see Pearl a few times a year. It\u2019s understandable therefore, that even though Mona has to be away this weekend as well, Louise can\u2019t be expected to give up one of her rare opportunities to spend time with her child. </p><p>Dan stands with the two women in the lobby, trying not to let his distress leak into his expression as he drinks in the sight of them, bundled in thick coats, laden with luggage, about to abandon him up here, alone. Well, almost alone. </p><p>\u201cI took Phil some shepherd\u2019s pie up to his room an hour or so ago,\u201d Louise tells Dan. \u201cSo he shouldn\u2019t need anything until the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do anything to aggravate him,\u201d Mona says in a low voice, zipping up her coat.\u00a0\u201cRemember he\u2019s our best customer.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Before Dan can snort derisively, the front door opens and Kaspar walks through, strutting across the lobby to place a large hand on each of the women\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYour carriage has arrived, pretty ladies,\u201d he says, beaming. \u201cI will load your cases.\u201d </p><p>Avoiding his eye, Mona primly hands over her suitcase to Kaspar, and Louise all but chucks her own bag into his arms. Dan bites his thumbnail; in just a few minutes, they\u2019ll be gone entirely. For two whole days.\u00a0</p><p>Sensing his quiet distress, Louise comes over and squeezes her arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. There\u2019s a week\u2019s worth of meals in the freezer. Your macchiatos haven\u2019t killed anyone in hours. And Phil\u2019s about as scary as a honey bee, once you see past his sting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lou. Have fun with Pearl,\u201d Dan replies, forcing a smile. He chooses not to mention his acute fear (and allergy) of bees.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Monday, dweeb,\u201d she says, releasing him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Mona takes hold of one of Dan\u2019s hands in both of hers then, her eyes round and desperately searching for reassurance. \u201cYou\u2019ll be alright, won\u2019t you Dan?\u201d </p><p>For a brief moment, he thinks about saying no, and begging her to stay. But he could never be so cruel. A sick grandmother is a pretty damn good reason to cry off a job she works insane hours for, for a couple of days. \u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Dan says, stretching that forced smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing, I\u2019ve got the schedule down. Breakfast served at three, right?\u201d </p><p>Mona sends him one of the \u2018not funny\u2019 looks she usually reserves for Louise. In a strange way, this makes him feel a bit better, like he\u2019s been accepted as part of her trusted team. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a couple of days,\u201d she says, then gives his upper arms a quick squeeze. </p><p>Kaspar returns from loading their luggage, and the three of them head for the door, squawking about how cold it\u2019s going to be, and how Kaspar\u2019s inevitably going to make them fear for their lives by rocking the car to and fro, just to watch them shriek. They call a final goodbye to Dan, and with a cheery wave, Kaspar pulls the door firmly shut behind them. </p><p>For a few long moments, all Dan does is stare at the place they just were. Then, his eyes lift towards the ceiling, as if he could see straight through it, all the way up to the top floor, where Phil is\u2026 well. Who knows what he\u2019s doing in that room. Throwing darts at a smiling photo of Dan\u2019s face, perhaps. </p><p>He sighs, then sits down at the desk, wondering what to do with himself. In half an hour, it will be ten o\u2019clock, the time his shift normally ends. It\u2019s unlikely that Mr Novokoric will appear before then, so Dan could just call it a night, and go to bed. If he was really needed for any reason, Mr Novokoric could knock on his door. He sincerely hopes that he won\u2019t do this, however. The idea of Phil seeing Dan, in his mismatching pyjamas and red-eyed from his night-time cry, is a horrifying one. </p><p>Mostly out of fear of Mr Novokoric needing him and Dan not being around, which could lead to him telling Mona he\u2019s an incapable idiot, Dan remains where he is, rigid in his reception seat, until the clock strikes ten. Then, he gets up and begins doing all the things on the \u2018end of the day\u2019 checklist Mona went over with him numerous times. Lock the front door. Switch off the computer. Lock the door to the office. Turn off the lobby lights. Up to the mezzanine. Tidy any stray books, games or blankets left lying around. Lock the balcony doors. Go into the kitchen, turn off the oven, wipe down the countertops. Lights off. Up the stairs to the guest room floor. Lights off in the hallway. Up the final set of stairs. Open door to room. Linger in the hall staring at the light under the door of room eight. Go into room. Pyjamas. Clean teeth. Bed. Cry. Music. Stop crying. Listen. Sleep. </p><p>*</p><p>The snow is wet, but not as cold as he\u2019d imagined. Dan is spread-eagled, on his back in the thick of it. Above him is an endless stretch of blue so pale it looks almost grey. He wonders if perhaps he\u2019s laid in the sky, and is looking down at the Earth. To dispel this theory, a crow flies above him, circling once, before swooping down to perch on his chest. Dan breathes out a wash of steam.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>The crow squawks. <i>Hello.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where I am,\u201d Dan admits.\u00a0</p><p>His usual state of\u00a0anxiety is gone for now. Despite his ignorance of what\u2019s happening, he\u2019s quite enjoying not knowing what\u2019s next. He feels buoyant and free. Unless someone were gazing down from a cloud or a very tall tree, they\u2019d never spot him in the midst of this landscape of white. That thought is a comforting one.</p><p>The crow opens its beak again, and squawks several times. <i>You will find yourself soon. </i></p><p>Dan nods thoughtfully. The crow stamps its small, twiglet feet on Dan\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have some time away,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m sad, but at least it\u2019s just me that\u2019s sad.\u201d </p><p>The crow pecks lightly at Dan\u2019s nose. <i>You don\u2019t make people sad, Dan. </i></p><p>\u201cI feel like I disappoint people,\u201d Dan says, honestly. \u201cMy parents. Beth. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll eventually disappoint Mona too. And Louise. I\u2019ve already disappointed one of the guests.\u201d </p><p>The crow stretches out one wing, and tucks its beak into the crook, then squawks, <i>people disappoint themselves. They expect things you cannot always provide. This is not your fault.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Dan considers the crow\u2019s point, staring into its mass of oil-slick feathers. A jet, beady eye pokes out, holding his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re very wise.\u201d</p><p>The crow extends both wings. <i>And you are stronger than you know. </i></p><p>Before Dan can say anything else, the crow flaps its wings, beating gusts of cool air into Dan\u2019s face, and takes off, soaring into the pale sky. It flies higher and higher, until it\u2019s nothing but a black speck, and then out of view entirely. The snow is melting from his body heat beneath him, and he is beginning to sink down. For a moment, Dan is tempted to let himself be engulfed, to disappear into the white plains of this place. But he knows the crow is watching him, even from wherever it flew. The crow is waiting for Dan to move, to fight the feeling of unworthiness that\u2019s pushing him down. So, he sits up; the cold snow slides down his back. He grits his teeth, focused on a faraway melody, and stands. </p><p>Dan wakes up in his bed with a sense of vigour about him. His dream had been unusual, to say the least, but has instilled a determination in him. He\u2019s got the lay of the land now; he can run this place for forty-eight hours. There aren\u2019t even any guests to look after, aside from one. He gets ready quickly, shrouded in his new cape of confidence, and goes downstairs to set up for a likely needless breakfast. </p><p>As soon as he walks into the mezzanine lounge, he stops short at the sight of Phil Novokoric sat at one of the indoor tables, reading a book, a mug of coffee in his hand. The cape of confidence flies off Dan\u2019s shoulders, sweeping off into the stratosphere. </p><p>\u201cOh. Good- good morning, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan manages, only stumbling slightly as he edges towards the kitchen. \u201cUm, Phil, I mean.\u201d </p><p>Phil lifts his head from his book, azure eyes glinting. \u201cGood morning, Dan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2026 already got a coffee, then?\u201d </p><p>Phil lifts an eyebrow, looking briefly down at the mug he\u2019s holding. \u201cIt would appear so.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Dan says, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at the sarcasm. It takes a moment for the implication of this to sink in, given that Louise couldn\u2019t have made it for him, but when it does, Dan narrows his eyes. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an instant coffee,\u201d Phil says, wrinkling his nose. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then his stomach flips. He\u2019s going to have to ask, isn\u2019t he? Oh, crap. \u201cWould- would you like a macchiato?\u201d </p><p>Phil assesses him carefully, setting his book down. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says after a moment. </p><p>Oh no. Dan\u2019s been practicing like mad for two days with Louise, but he\u2019s still not totally confident about his aptitude with the coffee machine. Nevertheless, he\u2019s offered now, and he has to grant the request of the customer, no exceptions. Bracing himself for ridicule, or possibly just a sneer of contempt, Dan nods, and disappears into the kitchen.</p><p>He makes four different macchiatos, each of which seem to turn out slightly differently, much to his dismay. He tries to time the frothing of the milk, to clean the nozzle rigorously each time. In the end, he just selects the one that most resembles Louise\u2019s perfect macchiatos that she can seem to whip up without looking, and takes a deep breath before bringing it out to Phil. He\u2019s trembling as he places it down on the table, which Phil definitely notices, but doesn\u2019t comment on, thankfully. </p><p>Phil peers at the coffee, scrutinising, then brings it to his nose for a gentle sniff. \u201cRemembered the caramel this time, then,\u201d he mutters, and Dan only just stops himself from finding the caramel syrup in the kitchen and upending it over his head. </p><p>Phil takes a cautious sip, then another, and then an actual gulp. He lowers the mug, eyebrows raised, and places it carefully back on the table. Dan only realises he\u2019s hovering, watching Phil\u2019s reaction with hawk-like attention, when Phil fixes him with a bemused stare and says, \u201cthanks.\u201d </p><p>He turns his attention back to his book, and Dan realises he\u2019s being dismissed. \u201cOh. No problem.\u201d </p><p>He steps back with an absurd little bow of his head; Phil might let out a tiny smile, but Dan can\u2019t be sure if it\u2019s because he thinks Dan\u2019s an idiot, or because of something amusing in his book. Either way, he needs to leave before he humiliates himself properly. He heads back into the kitchen and unearths one of Louise\u2019s homemade loaves of bread, which he then cuts four thick slices of. He toasts them under the grill, then spreads them with butter and plum jam. He puts two on one plate, and two on another, then carries them out of the kitchen. He places one plate down in front of Phil, who looks up in surprise, and then scurries downstairs to reception with his own plate before Phil can say anything. Dan eats his breakfast in between chores - sweeping the lobby, unlocking the doors, and setting up for the day. </p><p>Eventually, he runs out of things to do, and though he really would rather not go back upstairs and make more embarrassing small talk with Phil, he has no other choice. He picks up his empty plate from the desk, and heads back up to the mezzanine area. Mercifully, Phil\u2019s table is now devoid of Phil, though his book and mugs are still there. He\u2019s taken two bites out of one slice of toast. It\u2019s been a while though, so Dan assumes he must have finished, and takes the plate into the kitchen along with his own. It seems a waste to throw an entire untouched piece of toast into the bin, so Dan scoffs that one too, humming a Muse song as he chews, and washing plates. As he\u2019s swallowing the last bit, he hears the sound of a throat clearing, and turns, only slightly choking on toast crumbs, towards the noise. </p><p>Phil is at the serving hatch, his big crimson ski jacket on, and a faintly amused expression on his face. He pushes the two mugs across the hatch. \u201cWhat is that you\u2019re humming?\u201d He frowns, as if trying to place it. \u201cSounds familiar.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a Muse song.\u201d Dan\u2019s hands are soapy, dripping at his sides. He shakes the suds off them, self-consciously. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Phil says. \u201cNever liked Muse. All their songs sound the same.\u201d </p><p>Another reason to detest this fool. Clearly he has no taste in music. Aside from\u2026 classical, perhaps. </p><p>\u201cEach to their own,\u201d Dan says in an attempt at brightness, then walks over to collect the dirty mugs from him. Just as he turns to leave, Phil reaches out and catches Dan\u2019s wrist. It\u2019s a light, soft touch, and is gone again the next second, but Dan feels as if he\u2019s been zapped with 10,000 volts. He freezes, just about managing to hang onto the cups. \u201cEr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome skiing with me,\u201d Phil says, knocking Dan out of orbit. </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a>!)</b></p>",

Visitors aren\u2019t a frequent occurrence.<br></p><p>In the next moment, Mona gathers herself, smooths down her jacket lapels and goes to answer the door. As soon as she opens it, Kaspar bursts through, brandishing a pair of electric blue skis, a smallish parcel under his arm, and a pile of letters secured with string. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cMy gorgeous Mona!\u201d he exclaims, dropping everything onto the side-table nearby in order to pull her into a hug. He dwarfs her small frame with his big, beefy arms, but she doesn\u2019t struggle, patting Kaspar politely on the shoulder and waiting for him to have had his fill. \u201cYour eyes, they shine brighter than the sun glinting off the mountain snow. Your skin is the colour of a young fawn-\u201d </p><p>\u201cG-good morning, Kaspar,\u201d Mona stammers out quickly once she\u2019s been released. Her cheeks are now tinged a deep pink. \u201cShall I take these?\u201d </p><p>She reaches past him to pluck the bundle of letters from the table. \u201cMy beauty,\u201d Kaspar says, catching her by the arm as she attempts to grapple with the skis. \u201cAllow me to lift your burdens. I will take care of everything. I can read you each letter one by one-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of reading my own mail, Kaspar,\u201d Mona interrupts sternly, though her cheeks are practically aflame at this point. Dan watches on in amusement, pretending to be busy on the reception computer.\u00a0\u201cThough I would appreciate your help taking the skis up to the top floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy angel, if you asked I would let you sail down the mountain on by back,\u201d Kaspar cries, to which Mona rolls her eyes, but does let out a tiny smile.\u00a0</p><p>Kaspar lifts the skis onto his shoulder, then reaches for the parcel. Dan jumps to his feet so abruptly that he knocks the computer mouse off the desk. Mona and Kaspar turn in surprise at the sound.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the other parcel,\u201d Dan blurts,\u00a0catching the mouse from where it swings from its cord, and placing it carefully back on the mousepad.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s for Mr Novokoric, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Mona plucks the package from Kaspar and studies the name on the label, frowning. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2026 mentioned that he\u2019d ordered a new phone.\u201d</p><p>Something about this response makes Mona\u2019s\u00a0eyes widen. \u201cHe\u2026 told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan says, that niggling sense that he\u2019s missing something rearing its head once again. \u201cIs that strange?\u201d </p><p>Mona shrugs, but gives him a once over. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine. Take the package.\u00a0 You can lead the way to Mr Novokoric\u2019s room. Show Kaspar where it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle Dan, you are my sherpa,\u201d Kaspar declares, grinning. Armed with the skis resting over his broad shoulder, Kaspar appears rather menacing. \u201cLead on.\u201d</p><p>Ducking as Kaspar turns to and fro, expressively admiring the lobby interior as Mona blushes and accepts compliments, Dan goes to collect the package from the table. Mona summons the courage to ask Kaspar whether he\u2019d like a coffee before he leaves again, and Kaspar\u2019s enthusiasm for this nearly severs Dan\u2019s neck from his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>He scurries quickly towards the stairs, assuming that Kaspar will follow once he\u2019s done fawning over the manager. As they begin the ascent, Kaspar prattles on about how the blizzard that was forecast for today is nowhere to be seen, and that Kaspar himself knows far more than \u2018<i>those baboons with their balloons and barometers</i>\u2019 ever will. Dan just nods along, unable to get a word in edgeways even if he were so inclined.\u00a0</p><p>In truth, Dan\u2019s rather glad of Kaspar\u2019s non-stop chatter, as he himself is too busy trying to understand why he\u2019s voluntarily hurled himself into this situation. On most days, he barely has to converse with Phil at all, and that\u2019s just fine. The less they speak to one another, the less chance there is for Dan\u2019s day to be ruined by whatever insult Phil lets slip as casually as Kaspar comments on the weather. Now, for some reason, he\u2019s willingly placed himself in the line of fire. For the life of him, Dan cannot understand it, but something about watching Mona and Kaspar had shaken free an urgent desire to see Phil. To deliver the first bit of good news the man has probably gotten in quite some time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think now we are another thousand feet up!\u201d Kaspar jokes as they emerge on the top floor landing.\u00a0<br></p><p>Dan manages a polite titter in response.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s room eight,\u201d he says, gesturing to Phil\u2019s door.\u00a0</p><p>The hallway is silent apart from Dan and Kaspar\u2019s breathing from the climb. Kaspar has an excuse, given that he\u2019s lugging enormous skis; Dan\u2019s parcel isn\u2019t that heavy, but he is incredibly unfit. Part of Dan wishes he could take a moment to get his breath back before knocking on Phil\u2019s door, but explaining this would probably only confuse Kaspar, so he decides to just go for it.\u00a0</p><p>He knocks, just as Kaspar begins to sing breathily - something Swiss and jaunty that Dan is pretty sure is out of tune. The door opens after a while, and Phil stands there, his shirt half-buttoned, his hair ruffled and messy. He looks like he\u2019s just been ravished in the enormous four-poster bed Dan can see behind him. </p><p>\u201cWe- our- Kaspar- um, we have a- packages for- um. Here.\u201d Mostly to stop his mouth from doing whatever it\u2019s doing, Dan pushes the box into Phil\u2019s hands.</p><p>Phil gives him a curious look, then moves his attention to Kaspar and the skis. \u201cOh, awesome,\u201d he says, then seems to remember himself. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s excellent, Kaspar. Thank you for bringing those up.\u201d </p><p>He takes a step to one side in the doorway, letting a still-singing Kaspar swan through into Phil\u2019s suite. Even from his limited viewpoint, it\u2019s clear to Dan that this room is three times the size of his own next door, and far more luxurious. There\u2019s a chaise longue, for one thing, and a window seat, and a huge wall-mounted television. </p><p>\u201cAnd where would you like me to put these, Philly?\u201d Kaspar asks in his loud, jolly voice.\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot towards the ceiling. <i>Philly? \u00a0</i></p><p>It might be Dan\u2019s imagination, but he thinks he sees a light blush skimming atop Phil\u2019s high cheekbones. \u201cIn the cupboard, if you don\u2019t mind, Kaspar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kaspar replies, springing out of sight somewhere deeper into the suite. </p><p>Phil turns back to Dan, then looks down at the box he\u2019s been given. \u201cThanks for this,\u201d he says, unexpectedly. \u201cI\u2019m going mad without a phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem. I mean, Mona ordered it, I\u2019m just the delivery boy.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, and a painful silence falls. Dan, having always detested awkwardness, cannot let it just sit on their shoulders, so for some reason says, \u201ctry not to chuck this one off a mountain!\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s a joke, of course, but Phil doesn\u2019t laugh. Instead, his lips press together, and Dan remembers - <i>idiot, idiot, idiot</i> - that the information about what happened to Phil\u2019s previous phone was gleaned from eavesdropping on a phone call he had with his husband. </p><p>\u201cI hear we\u2019re going to be alone over the next few days,\u201d Phil says, swiftly changing the subject, to Dan\u2019s relief. </p><p>\u201cMona and Louise are away, yeah,\u201d Dan says, not bothering to hide the dread in his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s another couple of guests, but yeah it\u2019ll just be me in terms of staff-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the other couple cancelled?\u201d </p><p>Dan freezes, staring at Phil as a gelatinous glob of horror trickles down his spine. \u201cW-what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was speaking with Mona last night,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI think she said the other guests called to say they were too worried about the forecast blizzard.\u201d </p><p>Just then, Kaspar re-emerges, arms empty of skis, beaming away as he squeezes past them back through the door. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your day, Philly. Come now, little Dan, let us leave him to his duties.\u201d </p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches when he hears the phrase \u2018little Dan\u2019, which is mildly embarrassing, but Dan is too boggled to feel it too deeply. Instead, Dan nods vaguely at Phil, who says nothing more, and then follows Kaspar back down the hall, past his own room, towards the stairs. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWell of course I was going to mention it, Dan,\u201d Mona says distractedly, taking the coffee Dan made - courtesy of Louise\u2019s careful tuition - and placing it down in front of Kaspar, who takes her hand and kisses it. She pulls free of him quickly, flushing for the umpteenth time, and turns back to Dan. \u201cHonestly, I thought you\u2019d be relieved! Now you won\u2019t have to worry about keeping guests happy. You just have to make sure the place doesn\u2019t blow up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re forgetting one guest,\u201d Dan can\u2019t help but point out. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me alone here with- with-\u00a0<i>him</i>!\u201d </p><p>Louise\u2019s snicker echoes through the kitchen behind him, and Dan makes a mental note to \u2018accidentally\u2019 spray her with coffee during their next lesson. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, exactly?\u201d Mona asks, a touch impatiently. Her eyes are flicking back towards Kaspar, who is patting the chair beside his emphatically. \u201cLouise seems to be under the impression that you and Mr Novokoric had straightened things out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe apologised to Dan very nicely for upsetting him!\u201d Louise calls unhelpfully from somewhere behind him. </p><p>Mona gives Dan a satisfied smile. \u201cThere, nothing to worry about then. Besides, I doubt you\u2019ll see much of him. Of course you\u2019ll need to deliver his meals to his room if he wants them. Louise can show you what needs doing with that. But apart from that, the man barely ever makes a peep.\u201d </p><p>Begrudgingly, Dan nods, and Mona turns from him, making her way back over to Kaspar\u2019s table. Dan watches her being flirted with for a few minutes, bemoaning his decision to take this bloody job, which has landed him a whole two days with a spoiled member of Swiss Royalty. His stomach flips as he considers the length of time stretching ahead, with just the two of them, up here, all alone. Then, he sighs, heads back into the kitchen, and calls for Louise to come and show him how to make a macchiato again. </p><p>*</p><p>Kaspar stays until the evening, with the excuse that he might as well stay until it\u2019s time to escort Mona and Louise down the mountain. Louise is leaving for the weekend in order to see her daughter, Pearl, who lives with her father in Sussex, England. The nature of Louise\u2019s job, along with certain court sentences that Dan doesn\u2019t have the heart to ask about yet, means that she only gets to see Pearl a few times a year. It\u2019s understandable therefore, that even though Mona has to be away this weekend as well, Louise can\u2019t be expected to give up one of her rare opportunities to spend time with her child. </p><p>Dan stands with the two women in the lobby, trying not to let his distress leak into his expression as he drinks in the sight of them, bundled in thick coats, laden with luggage, about to abandon him up here, alone. Well, almost alone. </p><p>\u201cI took Phil some shepherd\u2019s pie up to his room an hour or so ago,\u201d Louise tells Dan. \u201cSo he shouldn\u2019t need anything until the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do anything to aggravate him,\u201d Mona says in a low voice, zipping up her coat.\u00a0\u201cRemember he\u2019s our best customer.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Before Dan can snort derisively, the front door opens and Kaspar walks through, strutting across the lobby to place a large hand on each of the women\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYour carriage has arrived, pretty ladies,\u201d he says, beaming. \u201cI will load your cases.\u201d </p><p>Avoiding his eye, Mona primly hands over her suitcase to Kaspar, and Louise all but chucks her own bag into his arms. Dan bites his thumbnail; in just a few minutes, they\u2019ll be gone entirely. For two whole days.\u00a0</p><p>Sensing his quiet distress, Louise comes over and squeezes her arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. There\u2019s a week\u2019s worth of meals in the freezer. Your macchiatos haven\u2019t killed anyone in hours. And Phil\u2019s about as scary as a honey bee, once you see past his sting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lou. Have fun with Pearl,\u201d Dan replies, forcing a smile. He chooses not to mention his acute fear (and allergy) of bees.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Monday, dweeb,\u201d she says, releasing him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Mona takes hold of one of Dan\u2019s hands in both of hers then, her eyes round and desperately searching for reassurance. \u201cYou\u2019ll be alright, won\u2019t you Dan?\u201d </p><p>For a brief moment, he thinks about saying no, and begging her to stay. But he could never be so cruel. A sick grandmother is a pretty damn good reason to cry off a job she works insane hours for, for a couple of days. \u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Dan says, stretching that forced smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing, I\u2019ve got the schedule down. Breakfast served at three, right?\u201d </p><p>Mona sends him one of the \u2018not funny\u2019 looks she usually reserves for Louise. In a strange way, this makes him feel a bit better, like he\u2019s been accepted as part of her trusted team. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a couple of days,\u201d she says, then gives his upper arms a quick squeeze. </p><p>Kaspar returns from loading their luggage, and the three of them head for the door, squawking about how cold it\u2019s going to be, and how Kaspar\u2019s inevitably going to make them fear for their lives by rocking the car to and fro, just to watch them shriek. They call a final goodbye to Dan, and with a cheery wave, Kaspar pulls the door firmly shut behind them. </p><p>For a few long moments, all Dan does is stare at the place they just were. Then, his eyes lift towards the ceiling, as if he could see straight through it, all the way up to the top floor, where Phil is\u2026 well. Who knows what he\u2019s doing in that room. Throwing darts at a smiling photo of Dan\u2019s face, perhaps. </p><p>He sighs, then sits down at the desk, wondering what to do with himself. In half an hour, it will be ten o\u2019clock, the time his shift normally ends. It\u2019s unlikely that Mr Novokoric will appear before then, so Dan could just call it a night, and go to bed. If he was really needed for any reason, Mr Novokoric could knock on his door. He sincerely hopes that he won\u2019t do this, however. The idea of Phil seeing Dan, in his mismatching pyjamas and red-eyed from his night-time cry, is a horrifying one. </p><p>Mostly out of fear of Mr Novokoric needing him and Dan not being around, which could lead to him telling Mona he\u2019s an incapable idiot, Dan remains where he is, rigid in his reception seat, until the clock strikes ten. Then, he gets up and begins doing all the things on the \u2018end of the day\u2019 checklist Mona went over with him numerous times. Lock the front door. Switch off the computer. Lock the door to the office. Turn off the lobby lights. Up to the mezzanine. Tidy any stray books, games or blankets left lying around. Lock the balcony doors. Go into the kitchen, turn off the oven, wipe down the countertops. Lights off. Up the stairs to the guest room floor. Lights off in the hallway. Up the final set of stairs. Open door to room. Linger in the hall staring at the light under the door of room eight. Go into room. Pyjamas. Clean teeth. Bed. Cry. Music. Stop crying. Listen. Sleep. </p><p>*</p><p>The snow is wet, but not as cold as he\u2019d imagined. Dan is spread-eagled, on his back in the thick of it. Above him is an endless stretch of blue so pale it looks almost grey. He wonders if perhaps he\u2019s laid in the sky, and is looking down at the Earth. To dispel this theory, a crow flies above him, circling once, before swooping down to perch on his chest. Dan breathes out a wash of steam.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>The crow squawks. <i>Hello.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where I am,\u201d Dan admits.\u00a0</p><p>His usual state of\u00a0anxiety is gone for now. Despite his ignorance of what\u2019s happening, he\u2019s quite enjoying not knowing what\u2019s next. He feels buoyant and free. Unless someone were gazing down from a cloud or a very tall tree, they\u2019d never spot him in the midst of this landscape of white. That thought is a comforting one.</p><p>The crow opens its beak again, and squawks several times. <i>You will find yourself soon. </i></p><p>Dan nods thoughtfully. The crow stamps its small, twiglet feet on Dan\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have some time away,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m sad, but at least it\u2019s just me that\u2019s sad.\u201d </p><p>The crow pecks lightly at Dan\u2019s nose. <i>You don\u2019t make people sad, Dan. </i></p><p>\u201cI feel like I disappoint people,\u201d Dan says, honestly. \u201cMy parents. Beth. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll eventually disappoint Mona too. And Louise. I\u2019ve already disappointed one of the guests.\u201d </p><p>The crow stretches out one wing, and tucks its beak into the crook, then squawks, <i>people disappoint themselves. They expect things you cannot always provide. This is not your fault.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Dan considers the crow\u2019s point, staring into its mass of oil-slick feathers. A jet, beady eye pokes out, holding his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re very wise.\u201d</p><p>The crow extends both wings. <i>And you are stronger than you know. </i></p><p>Before Dan can say anything else, the crow flaps its wings, beating gusts of cool air into Dan\u2019s face, and takes off, soaring into the pale sky. It flies higher and higher, until it\u2019s nothing but a black speck, and then out of view entirely. The snow is melting from his body heat beneath him, and he is beginning to sink down. For a moment, Dan is tempted to let himself be engulfed, to disappear into the white plains of this place. But he knows the crow is watching him, even from wherever it flew. The crow is waiting for Dan to move, to fight the feeling of unworthiness that\u2019s pushing him down. So, he sits up; the cold snow slides down his back. He grits his teeth, focused on a faraway melody, and stands. </p><p>Dan wakes up in his bed with a sense of vigour about him. His dream had been unusual, to say the least, but has instilled a determination in him. He\u2019s got the lay of the land now; he can run this place for forty-eight hours. There aren\u2019t even any guests to look after, aside from one. He gets ready quickly, shrouded in his new cape of confidence, and goes downstairs to set up for a likely needless breakfast. </p><p>As soon as he walks into the mezzanine lounge, he stops short at the sight of Phil Novokoric sat at one of the indoor tables, reading a book, a mug of coffee in his hand. The cape of confidence flies off Dan\u2019s shoulders, sweeping off into the stratosphere. </p><p>\u201cOh. Good- good morning, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan manages, only stumbling slightly as he edges towards the kitchen. \u201cUm, Phil, I mean.\u201d </p><p>Phil lifts his head from his book, azure eyes glinting. \u201cGood morning, Dan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2026 already got a coffee, then?\u201d </p><p>Phil lifts an eyebrow, looking briefly down at the mug he\u2019s holding. \u201cIt would appear so.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Dan says, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at the sarcasm. It takes a moment for the implication of this to sink in, given that Louise couldn\u2019t have made it for him, but when it does, Dan narrows his eyes. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an instant coffee,\u201d Phil says, wrinkling his nose. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then his stomach flips. He\u2019s going to have to ask, isn\u2019t he? Oh, crap. \u201cWould- would you like a macchiato?\u201d </p><p>Phil assesses him carefully, setting his book down. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says after a moment. </p><p>Oh no. Dan\u2019s been practicing like mad for two days with Louise, but he\u2019s still not totally confident about his aptitude with the coffee machine. Nevertheless, he\u2019s offered now, and he has to grant the request of the customer, no exceptions. Bracing himself for ridicule, or possibly just a sneer of contempt, Dan nods, and disappears into the kitchen.</p><p>He makes four different macchiatos, each of which seem to turn out slightly differently, much to his dismay. He tries to time the frothing of the milk, to clean the nozzle rigorously each time. In the end, he just selects the one that most resembles Louise\u2019s perfect macchiatos that she can seem to whip up without looking, and takes a deep breath before bringing it out to Phil. He\u2019s trembling as he places it down on the table, which Phil definitely notices, but doesn\u2019t comment on, thankfully. </p><p>Phil peers at the coffee, scrutinising, then brings it to his nose for a gentle sniff. \u201cRemembered the caramel this time, then,\u201d he mutters, and Dan only just stops himself from finding the caramel syrup in the kitchen and upending it over his head. </p><p>Phil takes a cautious sip, then another, and then an actual gulp. He lowers the mug, eyebrows raised, and places it carefully back on the table. Dan only realises he\u2019s hovering, watching Phil\u2019s reaction with hawk-like attention, when Phil fixes him with a bemused stare and says, \u201cthanks.\u201d </p><p>He turns his attention back to his book, and Dan realises he\u2019s being dismissed. \u201cOh. No problem.\u201d </p><p>He steps back with an absurd little bow of his head; Phil might let out a tiny smile, but Dan can\u2019t be sure if it\u2019s because he thinks Dan\u2019s an idiot, or because of something amusing in his book. Either way, he needs to leave before he humiliates himself properly. He heads back into the kitchen and unearths one of Louise\u2019s homemade loaves of bread, which he then cuts four thick slices of. He toasts them under the grill, then spreads them with butter and plum jam. He puts two on one plate, and two on another, then carries them out of the kitchen. He places one plate down in front of Phil, who looks up in surprise, and then scurries downstairs to reception with his own plate before Phil can say anything. Dan eats his breakfast in between chores - sweeping the lobby, unlocking the doors, and setting up for the day. </p><p>Eventually, he runs out of things to do, and though he really would rather not go back upstairs and make more embarrassing small talk with Phil, he has no other choice. He picks up his empty plate from the desk, and heads back up to the mezzanine area. Mercifully, Phil\u2019s table is now devoid of Phil, though his book and mugs are still there. He\u2019s taken two bites out of one slice of toast. It\u2019s been a while though, so Dan assumes he must have finished, and takes the plate into the kitchen along with his own. It seems a waste to throw an entire untouched piece of toast into the bin, so Dan scoffs that one too, humming a Muse song as he chews, and washing plates. As he\u2019s swallowing the last bit, he hears the sound of a throat clearing, and turns, only slightly choking on toast crumbs, towards the noise. </p><p>Phil is at the serving hatch, his big crimson ski jacket on, and a faintly amused expression on his face. He pushes the two mugs across the hatch. \u201cWhat is that you\u2019re humming?\u201d He frowns, as if trying to place it. \u201cSounds familiar.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a Muse song.\u201d Dan\u2019s hands are soapy, dripping at his sides. He shakes the suds off them, self-consciously. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Phil says. \u201cNever liked Muse. All their songs sound the same.\u201d </p><p>Another reason to detest this fool. Clearly he has no taste in music. Aside from\u2026 classical, perhaps. </p><p>\u201cEach to their own,\u201d Dan says in an attempt at brightness, then walks over to collect the dirty mugs from him. Just as he turns to leave, Phil reaches out and catches Dan\u2019s wrist. It\u2019s a light, soft touch, and is gone again the next second, but Dan feels as if he\u2019s been zapped with 10,000 volts. He freezes, just about managing to hang onto the cups. \u201cEr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome skiing with me,\u201d Phil says, knocking Dan out of orbit. </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a>!)</b></p>",

Both of them turn to the noise, obviously startled. They\u2019re 7,000 feet up the side of a mountain. Visitors aren\u2019t a frequent occurrence.<br></p><p>In the next moment, Mona gathers herself, smooths down her jacket lapels and goes to answer the door. As soon as she opens it, Kaspar bursts through, brandishing a pair of electric blue skis, a smallish parcel under his arm, and a pile of letters secured with string. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cMy gorgeous Mona!\u201d he exclaims, dropping everything onto the side-table nearby in order to pull her into a hug. He dwarfs her small frame with his big, beefy arms, but she doesn\u2019t struggle, patting Kaspar politely on the shoulder and waiting for him to have had his fill. \u201cYour eyes, they shine brighter than the sun glinting off the mountain snow. Your skin is the colour of a young fawn-\u201d </p><p>\u201cG-good morning, Kaspar,\u201d Mona stammers out quickly once she\u2019s been released. Her cheeks are now tinged a deep pink. \u201cShall I take these?\u201d </p><p>She reaches past him to pluck the bundle of letters from the table. \u201cMy beauty,\u201d Kaspar says, catching her by the arm as she attempts to grapple with the skis. \u201cAllow me to lift your burdens. I will take care of everything. I can read you each letter one by one-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of reading my own mail, Kaspar,\u201d Mona interrupts sternly, though her cheeks are practically aflame at this point. Dan watches on in amusement, pretending to be busy on the reception computer.\u00a0\u201cThough I would appreciate your help taking the skis up to the top floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy angel, if you asked I would let you sail down the mountain on by back,\u201d Kaspar cries, to which Mona rolls her eyes, but does let out a tiny smile.\u00a0</p><p>Kaspar lifts the skis onto his shoulder, then reaches for the parcel. Dan jumps to his feet so abruptly that he knocks the computer mouse off the desk. Mona and Kaspar turn in surprise at the sound.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the other parcel,\u201d Dan blurts,\u00a0catching the mouse from where it swings from its cord, and placing it carefully back on the mousepad.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s for Mr Novokoric, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Mona plucks the package from Kaspar and studies the name on the label, frowning. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2026 mentioned that he\u2019d ordered a new phone.\u201d</p><p>Something about this response makes Mona\u2019s\u00a0eyes widen. \u201cHe\u2026 told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan says, that niggling sense that he\u2019s missing something rearing its head once again. \u201cIs that strange?\u201d </p><p>Mona shrugs, but gives him a once over. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine. Take the package.\u00a0 You can lead the way to Mr Novokoric\u2019s room. Show Kaspar where it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle Dan, you are my sherpa,\u201d Kaspar declares, grinning. Armed with the skis resting over his broad shoulder, Kaspar appears rather menacing. \u201cLead on.\u201d</p><p>Ducking as Kaspar turns to and fro, expressively admiring the lobby interior as Mona blushes and accepts compliments, Dan goes to collect the package from the table. Mona summons the courage to ask Kaspar whether he\u2019d like a coffee before he leaves again, and Kaspar\u2019s enthusiasm for this nearly severs Dan\u2019s neck from his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>He scurries quickly towards the stairs, assuming that Kaspar will follow once he\u2019s done fawning over the manager. As they begin the ascent, Kaspar prattles on about how the blizzard that was forecast for today is nowhere to be seen, and that Kaspar himself knows far more than \u2018<i>those baboons with their balloons and barometers</i>\u2019 ever will. Dan just nods along, unable to get a word in edgeways even if he were so inclined.\u00a0</p><p>In truth, Dan\u2019s rather glad of Kaspar\u2019s non-stop chatter, as he himself is too busy trying to understand why he\u2019s voluntarily hurled himself into this situation. On most days, he barely has to converse with Phil at all, and that\u2019s just fine. The less they speak to one another, the less chance there is for Dan\u2019s day to be ruined by whatever insult Phil lets slip as casually as Kaspar comments on the weather. Now, for some reason, he\u2019s willingly placed himself in the line of fire. For the life of him, Dan cannot understand it, but something about watching Mona and Kaspar had shaken free an urgent desire to see Phil. To deliver the first bit of good news the man has probably gotten in quite some time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think now we are another thousand feet up!\u201d Kaspar jokes as they emerge on the top floor landing.\u00a0<br></p><p>Dan manages a polite titter in response.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s room eight,\u201d he says, gesturing to Phil\u2019s door.\u00a0</p><p>The hallway is silent apart from Dan and Kaspar\u2019s breathing from the climb. Kaspar has an excuse, given that he\u2019s lugging enormous skis; Dan\u2019s parcel isn\u2019t that heavy, but he is incredibly unfit. Part of Dan wishes he could take a moment to get his breath back before knocking on Phil\u2019s door, but explaining this would probably only confuse Kaspar, so he decides to just go for it.\u00a0</p><p>He knocks, just as Kaspar begins to sing breathily - something Swiss and jaunty that Dan is pretty sure is out of tune. The door opens after a while, and Phil stands there, his shirt half-buttoned, his hair ruffled and messy. He looks like he\u2019s just been ravished in the enormous four-poster bed Dan can see behind him. </p><p>\u201cWe- our- Kaspar- um, we have a- packages for- um. Here.\u201d Mostly to stop his mouth from doing whatever it\u2019s doing, Dan pushes the box into Phil\u2019s hands.</p><p>Phil gives him a curious look, then moves his attention to Kaspar and the skis. \u201cOh, awesome,\u201d he says, then seems to remember himself. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s excellent, Kaspar. Thank you for bringing those up.\u201d </p><p>He takes a step to one side in the doorway, letting a still-singing Kaspar swan through into Phil\u2019s suite. Even from his limited viewpoint, it\u2019s clear to Dan that this room is three times the size of his own next door, and far more luxurious. There\u2019s a chaise longue, for one thing, and a window seat, and a huge wall-mounted television. </p><p>\u201cAnd where would you like me to put these, Philly?\u201d Kaspar asks in his loud, jolly voice.\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot towards the ceiling. <i>Philly? \u00a0</i></p><p>It might be Dan\u2019s imagination, but he thinks he sees a light blush skimming atop Phil\u2019s high cheekbones. \u201cIn the cupboard, if you don\u2019t mind, Kaspar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kaspar replies, springing out of sight somewhere deeper into the suite. </p><p>Phil turns back to Dan, then looks down at the box he\u2019s been given. \u201cThanks for this,\u201d he says, unexpectedly. \u201cI\u2019m going mad without a phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem. I mean, Mona ordered it, I\u2019m just the delivery boy.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, and a painful silence falls. Dan, having always detested awkwardness, cannot let it just sit on their shoulders, so for some reason says, \u201ctry not to chuck this one off a mountain!\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s a joke, of course, but Phil doesn\u2019t laugh. Instead, his lips press together, and Dan remembers - <i>idiot, idiot, idiot</i> - that the information about what happened to Phil\u2019s previous phone was gleaned from eavesdropping on a phone call he had with his husband. </p><p>\u201cI hear we\u2019re going to be alone over the next few days,\u201d Phil says, swiftly changing the subject, to Dan\u2019s relief. </p><p>\u201cMona and Louise are away, yeah,\u201d Dan says, not bothering to hide the dread in his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s another couple of guests, but yeah it\u2019ll just be me in terms of staff-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the other couple cancelled?\u201d </p><p>Dan freezes, staring at Phil as a gelatinous glob of horror trickles down his spine. \u201cW-what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was speaking with Mona last night,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI think she said the other guests called to say they were too worried about the forecast blizzard.\u201d </p><p>Just then, Kaspar re-emerges, arms empty of skis, beaming away as he squeezes past them back through the door. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your day, Philly. Come now, little Dan, let us leave him to his duties.\u201d </p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches when he hears the phrase \u2018little Dan\u2019, which is mildly embarrassing, but Dan is too boggled to feel it too deeply. Instead, Dan nods vaguely at Phil, who says nothing more, and then follows Kaspar back down the hall, past his own room, towards the stairs. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWell of course I was going to mention it, Dan,\u201d Mona says distractedly, taking the coffee Dan made - courtesy of Louise\u2019s careful tuition - and placing it down in front of Kaspar, who takes her hand and kisses it. She pulls free of him quickly, flushing for the umpteenth time, and turns back to Dan. \u201cHonestly, I thought you\u2019d be relieved! Now you won\u2019t have to worry about keeping guests happy. You just have to make sure the place doesn\u2019t blow up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re forgetting one guest,\u201d Dan can\u2019t help but point out. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me alone here with- with-\u00a0<i>him</i>!\u201d </p><p>Louise\u2019s snicker echoes through the kitchen behind him, and Dan makes a mental note to \u2018accidentally\u2019 spray her with coffee during their next lesson. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, exactly?\u201d Mona asks, a touch impatiently. Her eyes are flicking back towards Kaspar, who is patting the chair beside his emphatically. \u201cLouise seems to be under the impression that you and Mr Novokoric had straightened things out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe apologised to Dan very nicely for upsetting him!\u201d Louise calls unhelpfully from somewhere behind him. </p><p>Mona gives Dan a satisfied smile. \u201cThere, nothing to worry about then. Besides, I doubt you\u2019ll see much of him. Of course you\u2019ll need to deliver his meals to his room if he wants them. Louise can show you what needs doing with that. But apart from that, the man barely ever makes a peep.\u201d </p><p>Begrudgingly, Dan nods, and Mona turns from him, making her way back over to Kaspar\u2019s table. Dan watches her being flirted with for a few minutes, bemoaning his decision to take this bloody job, which has landed him a whole two days with a spoiled member of Swiss Royalty. His stomach flips as he considers the length of time stretching ahead, with just the two of them, up here, all alone. Then, he sighs, heads back into the kitchen, and calls for Louise to come and show him how to make a macchiato again. </p><p>*</p><p>Kaspar stays until the evening, with the excuse that he might as well stay until it\u2019s time to escort Mona and Louise down the mountain. Louise is leaving for the weekend in order to see her daughter, Pearl, who lives with her father in Sussex, England. The nature of Louise\u2019s job, along with certain court sentences that Dan doesn\u2019t have the heart to ask about yet, means that she only gets to see Pearl a few times a year. It\u2019s understandable therefore, that even though Mona has to be away this weekend as well, Louise can\u2019t be expected to give up one of her rare opportunities to spend time with her child. </p><p>Dan stands with the two women in the lobby, trying not to let his distress leak into his expression as he drinks in the sight of them, bundled in thick coats, laden with luggage, about to abandon him up here, alone. Well, almost alone. </p><p>\u201cI took Phil some shepherd\u2019s pie up to his room an hour or so ago,\u201d Louise tells Dan. \u201cSo he shouldn\u2019t need anything until the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do anything to aggravate him,\u201d Mona says in a low voice, zipping up her coat.\u00a0\u201cRemember he\u2019s our best customer.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Before Dan can snort derisively, the front door opens and Kaspar walks through, strutting across the lobby to place a large hand on each of the women\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYour carriage has arrived, pretty ladies,\u201d he says, beaming. \u201cI will load your cases.\u201d </p><p>Avoiding his eye, Mona primly hands over her suitcase to Kaspar, and Louise all but chucks her own bag into his arms. Dan bites his thumbnail; in just a few minutes, they\u2019ll be gone entirely. For two whole days.\u00a0</p><p>Sensing his quiet distress, Louise comes over and squeezes her arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. There\u2019s a week\u2019s worth of meals in the freezer. Your macchiatos haven\u2019t killed anyone in hours. And Phil\u2019s about as scary as a honey bee, once you see past his sting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lou. Have fun with Pearl,\u201d Dan replies, forcing a smile. He chooses not to mention his acute fear (and allergy) of bees.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Monday, dweeb,\u201d she says, releasing him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Mona takes hold of one of Dan\u2019s hands in both of hers then, her eyes round and desperately searching for reassurance. \u201cYou\u2019ll be alright, won\u2019t you Dan?\u201d </p><p>For a brief moment, he thinks about saying no, and begging her to stay. But he could never be so cruel. A sick grandmother is a pretty damn good reason to cry off a job she works insane hours for, for a couple of days. \u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Dan says, stretching that forced smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing, I\u2019ve got the schedule down. Breakfast served at three, right?\u201d </p><p>Mona sends him one of the \u2018not funny\u2019 looks she usually reserves for Louise. In a strange way, this makes him feel a bit better, like he\u2019s been accepted as part of her trusted team. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a couple of days,\u201d she says, then gives his upper arms a quick squeeze. </p><p>Kaspar returns from loading their luggage, and the three of them head for the door, squawking about how cold it\u2019s going to be, and how Kaspar\u2019s inevitably going to make them fear for their lives by rocking the car to and fro, just to watch them shriek. They call a final goodbye to Dan, and with a cheery wave, Kaspar pulls the door firmly shut behind them. </p><p>For a few long moments, all Dan does is stare at the place they just were. Then, his eyes lift towards the ceiling, as if he could see straight through it, all the way up to the top floor, where Phil is\u2026 well. Who knows what he\u2019s doing in that room. Throwing darts at a smiling photo of Dan\u2019s face, perhaps. </p><p>He sighs, then sits down at the desk, wondering what to do with himself. In half an hour, it will be ten o\u2019clock, the time his shift normally ends. It\u2019s unlikely that Mr Novokoric will appear before then, so Dan could just call it a night, and go to bed. If he was really needed for any reason, Mr Novokoric could knock on his door. He sincerely hopes that he won\u2019t do this, however. The idea of Phil seeing Dan, in his mismatching pyjamas and red-eyed from his night-time cry, is a horrifying one. </p><p>Mostly out of fear of Mr Novokoric needing him and Dan not being around, which could lead to him telling Mona he\u2019s an incapable idiot, Dan remains where he is, rigid in his reception seat, until the clock strikes ten. Then, he gets up and begins doing all the things on the \u2018end of the day\u2019 checklist Mona went over with him numerous times. Lock the front door. Switch off the computer. Lock the door to the office. Turn off the lobby lights. Up to the mezzanine. Tidy any stray books, games or blankets left lying around. Lock the balcony doors. Go into the kitchen, turn off the oven, wipe down the countertops. Lights off. Up the stairs to the guest room floor. Lights off in the hallway. Up the final set of stairs. Open door to room. Linger in the hall staring at the light under the door of room eight. Go into room. Pyjamas. Clean teeth. Bed. Cry. Music. Stop crying. Listen. Sleep. </p><p>*</p><p>The snow is wet, but not as cold as he\u2019d imagined. Dan is spread-eagled, on his back in the thick of it. Above him is an endless stretch of blue so pale it looks almost grey. He wonders if perhaps he\u2019s laid in the sky, and is looking down at the Earth. To dispel this theory, a crow flies above him, circling once, before swooping down to perch on his chest. Dan breathes out a wash of steam.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>The crow squawks. <i>Hello.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where I am,\u201d Dan admits.\u00a0</p><p>His usual state of\u00a0anxiety is gone for now. Despite his ignorance of what\u2019s happening, he\u2019s quite enjoying not knowing what\u2019s next. He feels buoyant and free. Unless someone were gazing down from a cloud or a very tall tree, they\u2019d never spot him in the midst of this landscape of white. That thought is a comforting one.</p><p>The crow opens its beak again, and squawks several times. <i>You will find yourself soon. </i></p><p>Dan nods thoughtfully. The crow stamps its small, twiglet feet on Dan\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have some time away,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m sad, but at least it\u2019s just me that\u2019s sad.\u201d </p><p>The crow pecks lightly at Dan\u2019s nose. <i>You don\u2019t make people sad, Dan. </i></p><p>\u201cI feel like I disappoint people,\u201d Dan says, honestly. \u201cMy parents. Beth. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll eventually disappoint Mona too. And Louise. I\u2019ve already disappointed one of the guests.\u201d </p><p>The crow stretches out one wing, and tucks its beak into the crook, then squawks, <i>people disappoint themselves. They expect things you cannot always provide. This is not your fault.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Dan considers the crow\u2019s point, staring into its mass of oil-slick feathers. A jet, beady eye pokes out, holding his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re very wise.\u201d</p><p>The crow extends both wings. <i>And you are stronger than you know. </i></p><p>Before Dan can say anything else, the crow flaps its wings, beating gusts of cool air into Dan\u2019s face, and takes off, soaring into the pale sky. It flies higher and higher, until it\u2019s nothing but a black speck, and then out of view entirely. The snow is melting from his body heat beneath him, and he is beginning to sink down. For a moment, Dan is tempted to let himself be engulfed, to disappear into the white plains of this place. But he knows the crow is watching him, even from wherever it flew. The crow is waiting for Dan to move, to fight the feeling of unworthiness that\u2019s pushing him down. So, he sits up; the cold snow slides down his back. He grits his teeth, focused on a faraway melody, and stands. </p><p>Dan wakes up in his bed with a sense of vigour about him. His dream had been unusual, to say the least, but has instilled a determination in him. He\u2019s got the lay of the land now; he can run this place for forty-eight hours. There aren\u2019t even any guests to look after, aside from one. He gets ready quickly, shrouded in his new cape of confidence, and goes downstairs to set up for a likely needless breakfast. </p><p>As soon as he walks into the mezzanine lounge, he stops short at the sight of Phil Novokoric sat at one of the indoor tables, reading a book, a mug of coffee in his hand. The cape of confidence flies off Dan\u2019s shoulders, sweeping off into the stratosphere. </p><p>\u201cOh. Good- good morning, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan manages, only stumbling slightly as he edges towards the kitchen. \u201cUm, Phil, I mean.\u201d </p><p>Phil lifts his head from his book, azure eyes glinting. \u201cGood morning, Dan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2026 already got a coffee, then?\u201d </p><p>Phil lifts an eyebrow, looking briefly down at the mug he\u2019s holding. \u201cIt would appear so.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Dan says, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at the sarcasm. It takes a moment for the implication of this to sink in, given that Louise couldn\u2019t have made it for him, but when it does, Dan narrows his eyes. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an instant coffee,\u201d Phil says, wrinkling his nose. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then his stomach flips. He\u2019s going to have to ask, isn\u2019t he? Oh, crap. \u201cWould- would you like a macchiato?\u201d </p><p>Phil assesses him carefully, setting his book down. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says after a moment. </p><p>Oh no. Dan\u2019s been practicing like mad for two days with Louise, but he\u2019s still not totally confident about his aptitude with the coffee machine. Nevertheless, he\u2019s offered now, and he has to grant the request of the customer, no exceptions. Bracing himself for ridicule, or possibly just a sneer of contempt, Dan nods, and disappears into the kitchen.</p><p>He makes four different macchiatos, each of which seem to turn out slightly differently, much to his dismay. He tries to time the frothing of the milk, to clean the nozzle rigorously each time. In the end, he just selects the one that most resembles Louise\u2019s perfect macchiatos that she can seem to whip up without looking, and takes a deep breath before bringing it out to Phil. He\u2019s trembling as he places it down on the table, which Phil definitely notices, but doesn\u2019t comment on, thankfully. </p><p>Phil peers at the coffee, scrutinising, then brings it to his nose for a gentle sniff. \u201cRemembered the caramel this time, then,\u201d he mutters, and Dan only just stops himself from finding the caramel syrup in the kitchen and upending it over his head. </p><p>Phil takes a cautious sip, then another, and then an actual gulp. He lowers the mug, eyebrows raised, and places it carefully back on the table. Dan only realises he\u2019s hovering, watching Phil\u2019s reaction with hawk-like attention, when Phil fixes him with a bemused stare and says, \u201cthanks.\u201d </p><p>He turns his attention back to his book, and Dan realises he\u2019s being dismissed. \u201cOh. No problem.\u201d </p><p>He steps back with an absurd little bow of his head; Phil might let out a tiny smile, but Dan can\u2019t be sure if it\u2019s because he thinks Dan\u2019s an idiot, or because of something amusing in his book. Either way, he needs to leave before he humiliates himself properly. He heads back into the kitchen and unearths one of Louise\u2019s homemade loaves of bread, which he then cuts four thick slices of. He toasts them under the grill, then spreads them with butter and plum jam. He puts two on one plate, and two on another, then carries them out of the kitchen. He places one plate down in front of Phil, who looks up in surprise, and then scurries downstairs to reception with his own plate before Phil can say anything. Dan eats his breakfast in between chores - sweeping the lobby, unlocking the doors, and setting up for the day. </p><p>Eventually, he runs out of things to do, and though he really would rather not go back upstairs and make more embarrassing small talk with Phil, he has no other choice. He picks up his empty plate from the desk, and heads back up to the mezzanine area. Mercifully, Phil\u2019s table is now devoid of Phil, though his book and mugs are still there. He\u2019s taken two bites out of one slice of toast. It\u2019s been a while though, so Dan assumes he must have finished, and takes the plate into the kitchen along with his own. It seems a waste to throw an entire untouched piece of toast into the bin, so Dan scoffs that one too, humming a Muse song as he chews, and washing plates. As he\u2019s swallowing the last bit, he hears the sound of a throat clearing, and turns, only slightly choking on toast crumbs, towards the noise. </p><p>Phil is at the serving hatch, his big crimson ski jacket on, and a faintly amused expression on his face. He pushes the two mugs across the hatch. \u201cWhat is that you\u2019re humming?\u201d He frowns, as if trying to place it. \u201cSounds familiar.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a Muse song.\u201d Dan\u2019s hands are soapy, dripping at his sides. He shakes the suds off them, self-consciously. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Phil says. \u201cNever liked Muse. All their songs sound the same.\u201d </p><p>Another reason to detest this fool. Clearly he has no taste in music. Aside from\u2026 classical, perhaps. </p><p>\u201cEach to their own,\u201d Dan says in an attempt at brightness, then walks over to collect the dirty mugs from him. Just as he turns to leave, Phil reaches out and catches Dan\u2019s wrist. It\u2019s a light, soft touch, and is gone again the next second, but Dan feels as if he\u2019s been zapped with 10,000 volts. He freezes, just about managing to hang onto the cups. \u201cEr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome skiing with me,\u201d Phil says, knocking Dan out of orbit. </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a>!)</b></p>",

Both of them turn to the noise, obviously startled. They&rsquo;re 7,000 feet up the side of a mountain. Visitors aren&rsquo;t a frequent occurrence.<br /></p><p>In the next moment, Mona gathers herself, smooths down her jacket lapels and goes to answer the door. As soon as she opens it, Kaspar bursts through, brandishing a pair of electric blue skis, a smallish parcel under his arm, and a pile of letters secured with string. </p><p>&ldquo;My gorgeous Mona!&rdquo; he exclaims, dropping everything onto the side-table nearby in order to pull her into a hug. He dwarfs her small frame with his big, beefy arms, but she doesn&rsquo;t struggle, patting Kaspar politely on the shoulder and waiting for him to have had his fill. &ldquo;Your eyes, they shine brighter than the sun glinting off the mountain snow. Your skin is the colour of a young fawn-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;G-good morning, Kaspar,&rdquo; Mona stammers out quickly once she&rsquo;s been released. Her cheeks are now tinged a deep pink. &ldquo;Shall I take these?&rdquo; </p><p>She reaches past him to pluck the bundle of letters from the table. &ldquo;My beauty,&rdquo; Kaspar says, catching her by the arm as she attempts to grapple with the skis. &ldquo;Allow me to lift your burdens. I will take care of everything. I can read you each letter one by one-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of reading my own mail, Kaspar,&rdquo; Mona interrupts sternly, though her cheeks are practically aflame at this point. Dan watches on in amusement, pretending to be busy on the reception computer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Though I would appreciate your help taking the skis up to the top floor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My angel, if you asked I would let you sail down the mountain on by back,&rdquo; Kaspar cries, to which Mona rolls her eyes, but does let out a tiny smile.&nbsp;</p><p>Kaspar lifts the skis onto his shoulder, then reaches for the parcel. Dan jumps to his feet so abruptly that he knocks the computer mouse off the desk. Mona and Kaspar turn in surprise at the sound.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the other parcel,&rdquo; Dan blurts,&nbsp;catching the mouse from where it swings from its cord, and placing it carefully back on the mousepad.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Mr Novokoric, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Mona plucks the package from Kaspar and studies the name on the label, frowning. &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&hellip; mentioned that he&rsquo;d ordered a new phone.&rdquo;</p><p>Something about this response makes Mona&rsquo;s&nbsp;eyes widen. &ldquo;He&hellip; told you that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dan says, that niggling sense that he&rsquo;s missing something rearing its head once again. &ldquo;Is that strange?&rdquo; </p><p>Mona shrugs, but gives him a once over. &ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s fine. Take the package.&nbsp; You can lead the way to Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s room. Show Kaspar where it is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Little Dan, you are my sherpa,&rdquo; Kaspar declares, grinning. Armed with the skis resting over his broad shoulder, Kaspar appears rather menacing. &ldquo;Lead on.&rdquo;</p><p>Ducking as Kaspar turns to and fro, expressively admiring the lobby interior as Mona blushes and accepts compliments, Dan goes to collect the package from the table. Mona summons the courage to ask Kaspar whether he&rsquo;d like a coffee before he leaves again, and Kaspar&rsquo;s enthusiasm for this nearly severs Dan&rsquo;s neck from his shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>He scurries quickly towards the stairs, assuming that Kaspar will follow once he&rsquo;s done fawning over the manager. As they begin the ascent, Kaspar prattles on about how the blizzard that was forecast for today is nowhere to be seen, and that Kaspar himself knows far more than &lsquo;<i>those baboons with their balloons and barometers</i>&rsquo; ever will. Dan just nods along, unable to get a word in edgeways even if he were so inclined.&nbsp;</p><p>In truth, Dan&rsquo;s rather glad of Kaspar&rsquo;s non-stop chatter, as he himself is too busy trying to understand why he&rsquo;s voluntarily hurled himself into this situation. On most days, he barely has to converse with Phil at all, and that&rsquo;s just fine. The less they speak to one another, the less chance there is for Dan&rsquo;s day to be ruined by whatever insult Phil lets slip as casually as Kaspar comments on the weather. Now, for some reason, he&rsquo;s willingly placed himself in the line of fire. For the life of him, Dan cannot understand it, but something about watching Mona and Kaspar had shaken free an urgent desire to see Phil. To deliver the first bit of good news the man has probably gotten in quite some time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think now we are another thousand feet up!&rdquo; Kaspar jokes as they emerge on the top floor landing.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Dan manages a polite titter in response.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s room eight,&rdquo; he says, gesturing to Phil&rsquo;s door.&nbsp;</p><p>The hallway is silent apart from Dan and Kaspar&rsquo;s breathing from the climb. Kaspar has an excuse, given that he&rsquo;s lugging enormous skis; Dan&rsquo;s parcel isn&rsquo;t that heavy, but he is incredibly unfit. Part of Dan wishes he could take a moment to get his breath back before knocking on Phil&rsquo;s door, but explaining this would probably only confuse Kaspar, so he decides to just go for it.&nbsp;</p><p>He knocks, just as Kaspar begins to sing breathily - something Swiss and jaunty that Dan is pretty sure is out of tune. The door opens after a while, and Phil stands there, his shirt half-buttoned, his hair ruffled and messy. He looks like he&rsquo;s just been ravished in the enormous four-poster bed Dan can see behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;We- our- Kaspar- um, we have a- packages for- um. Here.&rdquo; Mostly to stop his mouth from doing whatever it&rsquo;s doing, Dan pushes the box into Phil&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>Phil gives him a curious look, then moves his attention to Kaspar and the skis. &ldquo;Oh, awesome,&rdquo; he says, then seems to remember himself. &ldquo;I mean, that&rsquo;s excellent, Kaspar. Thank you for bringing those up.&rdquo; </p><p>He takes a step to one side in the doorway, letting a still-singing Kaspar swan through into Phil&rsquo;s suite. Even from his limited viewpoint, it&rsquo;s clear to Dan that this room is three times the size of his own next door, and far more luxurious. There&rsquo;s a chaise longue, for one thing, and a window seat, and a huge wall-mounted television. </p><p>&ldquo;And where would you like me to put these, Philly?&rdquo; Kaspar asks in his loud, jolly voice.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows shoot towards the ceiling. <i>Philly? &nbsp;</i></p><p>It might be Dan&rsquo;s imagination, but he thinks he sees a light blush skimming atop Phil&rsquo;s high cheekbones. &ldquo;In the cupboard, if you don&rsquo;t mind, Kaspar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Kaspar replies, springing out of sight somewhere deeper into the suite. </p><p>Phil turns back to Dan, then looks down at the box he&rsquo;s been given. &ldquo;Thanks for this,&rdquo; he says, unexpectedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going mad without a phone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No problem. I mean, Mona ordered it, I&rsquo;m just the delivery boy.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil nods, and a painful silence falls. Dan, having always detested awkwardness, cannot let it just sit on their shoulders, so for some reason says, &ldquo;try not to chuck this one off a mountain!&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s a joke, of course, but Phil doesn&rsquo;t laugh. Instead, his lips press together, and Dan remembers - <i>idiot, idiot, idiot</i> - that the information about what happened to Phil&rsquo;s previous phone was gleaned from eavesdropping on a phone call he had with his husband. </p><p>&ldquo;I hear we&rsquo;re going to be alone over the next few days,&rdquo; Phil says, swiftly changing the subject, to Dan&rsquo;s relief. </p><p>&ldquo;Mona and Louise are away, yeah,&rdquo; Dan says, not bothering to hide the dread in his voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another couple of guests, but yeah it&rsquo;ll just be me in terms of staff-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought the other couple cancelled?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan freezes, staring at Phil as a gelatinous glob of horror trickles down his spine. &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was speaking with Mona last night,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I think she said the other guests called to say they were too worried about the forecast blizzard.&rdquo; </p><p>Just then, Kaspar re-emerges, arms empty of skis, beaming away as he squeezes past them back through the door. &ldquo;Enjoy the rest of your day, Philly. Come now, little Dan, let us leave him to his duties.&rdquo; </p><p>The corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth twitches when he hears the phrase &lsquo;little Dan&rsquo;, which is mildly embarrassing, but Dan is too boggled to feel it too deeply. Instead, Dan nods vaguely at Phil, who says nothing more, and then follows Kaspar back down the hall, past his own room, towards the stairs. </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Well of course I was going to mention it, Dan,&rdquo; Mona says distractedly, taking the coffee Dan made - courtesy of Louise&rsquo;s careful tuition - and placing it down in front of Kaspar, who takes her hand and kisses it. She pulls free of him quickly, flushing for the umpteenth time, and turns back to Dan. &ldquo;Honestly, I thought you&rsquo;d be relieved! Now you won&rsquo;t have to worry about keeping guests happy. You just have to make sure the place doesn&rsquo;t blow up.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re forgetting one guest,&rdquo; Dan can&rsquo;t help but point out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving me alone here with- with-&nbsp;<i>him</i>!&rdquo; </p><p>Louise&rsquo;s snicker echoes through the kitchen behind him, and Dan makes a mental note to &lsquo;accidentally&rsquo; spray her with coffee during their next lesson. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem, exactly?&rdquo; Mona asks, a touch impatiently. Her eyes are flicking back towards Kaspar, who is patting the chair beside his emphatically. &ldquo;Louise seems to be under the impression that you and Mr Novokoric had straightened things out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He apologised to Dan very nicely for upsetting him!&rdquo; Louise calls unhelpfully from somewhere behind him. </p><p>Mona gives Dan a satisfied smile. &ldquo;There, nothing to worry about then. Besides, I doubt you&rsquo;ll see much of him. Of course you&rsquo;ll need to deliver his meals to his room if he wants them. Louise can show you what needs doing with that. But apart from that, the man barely ever makes a peep.&rdquo; </p><p>Begrudgingly, Dan nods, and Mona turns from him, making her way back over to Kaspar&rsquo;s table. Dan watches her being flirted with for a few minutes, bemoaning his decision to take this bloody job, which has landed him a whole two days with a spoiled member of Swiss Royalty. His stomach flips as he considers the length of time stretching ahead, with just the two of them, up here, all alone. Then, he sighs, heads back into the kitchen, and calls for Louise to come and show him how to make a macchiato again. </p><p>*</p><p>Kaspar stays until the evening, with the excuse that he might as well stay until it&rsquo;s time to escort Mona and Louise down the mountain. Louise is leaving for the weekend in order to see her daughter, Pearl, who lives with her father in Sussex, England. The nature of Louise&rsquo;s job, along with certain court sentences that Dan doesn&rsquo;t have the heart to ask about yet, means that she only gets to see Pearl a few times a year. It&rsquo;s understandable therefore, that even though Mona has to be away this weekend as well, Louise can&rsquo;t be expected to give up one of her rare opportunities to spend time with her child. </p><p>Dan stands with the two women in the lobby, trying not to let his distress leak into his expression as he drinks in the sight of them, bundled in thick coats, laden with luggage, about to abandon him up here, alone. Well, almost alone. </p><p>&ldquo;I took Phil some shepherd&rsquo;s pie up to his room an hour or so ago,&rdquo; Louise tells Dan. &ldquo;So he shouldn&rsquo;t need anything until the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t do anything to aggravate him,&rdquo; Mona says in a low voice, zipping up her coat.&nbsp;&ldquo;Remember he&rsquo;s our best customer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Before Dan can snort derisively, the front door opens and Kaspar walks through, strutting across the lobby to place a large hand on each of the women&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Your carriage has arrived, pretty ladies,&rdquo; he says, beaming. &ldquo;I will load your cases.&rdquo; </p><p>Avoiding his eye, Mona primly hands over her suitcase to Kaspar, and Louise all but chucks her own bag into his arms. Dan bites his thumbnail; in just a few minutes, they&rsquo;ll be gone entirely. For two whole days.&nbsp;</p><p>Sensing his quiet distress, Louise comes over and squeezes her arms around him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine. There&rsquo;s a week&rsquo;s worth of meals in the freezer. Your macchiatos haven&rsquo;t killed anyone in hours. And Phil&rsquo;s about as scary as a honey bee, once you see past his sting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Lou. Have fun with Pearl,&rdquo; Dan replies, forcing a smile. He chooses not to mention his acute fear (and allergy) of bees.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you on Monday, dweeb,&rdquo; she says, releasing him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Mona takes hold of one of Dan&rsquo;s hands in both of hers then, her eyes round and desperately searching for reassurance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be alright, won&rsquo;t you Dan?&rdquo; </p><p>For a brief moment, he thinks about saying no, and begging her to stay. But he could never be so cruel. A sick grandmother is a pretty damn good reason to cry off a job she works insane hours for, for a couple of days. &ldquo;Yeah, of course,&rdquo; Dan says, stretching that forced smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about a thing, I&rsquo;ve got the schedule down. Breakfast served at three, right?&rdquo; </p><p>Mona sends him one of the &lsquo;not funny&rsquo; looks she usually reserves for Louise. In a strange way, this makes him feel a bit better, like he&rsquo;s been accepted as part of her trusted team. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in a couple of days,&rdquo; she says, then gives his upper arms a quick squeeze. </p><p>Kaspar returns from loading their luggage, and the three of them head for the door, squawking about how cold it&rsquo;s going to be, and how Kaspar&rsquo;s inevitably going to make them fear for their lives by rocking the car to and fro, just to watch them shriek. They call a final goodbye to Dan, and with a cheery wave, Kaspar pulls the door firmly shut behind them. </p><p>For a few long moments, all Dan does is stare at the place they just were. Then, his eyes lift towards the ceiling, as if he could see straight through it, all the way up to the top floor, where Phil is&hellip; well. Who knows what he&rsquo;s doing in that room. Throwing darts at a smiling photo of Dan&rsquo;s face, perhaps. </p><p>He sighs, then sits down at the desk, wondering what to do with himself. In half an hour, it will be ten o&rsquo;clock, the time his shift normally ends. It&rsquo;s unlikely that Mr Novokoric will appear before then, so Dan could just call it a night, and go to bed. If he was really needed for any reason, Mr Novokoric could knock on his door. He sincerely hopes that he won&rsquo;t do this, however. The idea of Phil seeing Dan, in his mismatching pyjamas and red-eyed from his night-time cry, is a horrifying one. </p><p>Mostly out of fear of Mr Novokoric needing him and Dan not being around, which could lead to him telling Mona he&rsquo;s an incapable idiot, Dan remains where he is, rigid in his reception seat, until the clock strikes ten. Then, he gets up and begins doing all the things on the &lsquo;end of the day&rsquo; checklist Mona went over with him numerous times. Lock the front door. Switch off the computer. Lock the door to the office. Turn off the lobby lights. Up to the mezzanine. Tidy any stray books, games or blankets left lying around. Lock the balcony doors. Go into the kitchen, turn off the oven, wipe down the countertops. Lights off. Up the stairs to the guest room floor. Lights off in the hallway. Up the final set of stairs. Open door to room. Linger in the hall staring at the light under the door of room eight. Go into room. Pyjamas. Clean teeth. Bed. Cry. Music. Stop crying. Listen. Sleep. </p><p>*</p><p>The snow is wet, but not as cold as he&rsquo;d imagined. Dan is spread-eagled, on his back in the thick of it. Above him is an endless stretch of blue so pale it looks almost grey. He wonders if perhaps he&rsquo;s laid in the sky, and is looking down at the Earth. To dispel this theory, a crow flies above him, circling once, before swooping down to perch on his chest. Dan breathes out a wash of steam.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>The crow squawks. <i>Hello.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure where I am,&rdquo; Dan admits.&nbsp;</p><p>His usual state of&nbsp;anxiety is gone for now. Despite his ignorance of what&rsquo;s happening, he&rsquo;s quite enjoying not knowing what&rsquo;s next. He feels buoyant and free. Unless someone were gazing down from a cloud or a very tall tree, they&rsquo;d never spot him in the midst of this landscape of white. That thought is a comforting one.</p><p>The crow opens its beak again, and squawks several times. <i>You will find yourself soon. </i></p><p>Dan nods thoughtfully. The crow stamps its small, twiglet feet on Dan&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to have some time away,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad, but at least it&rsquo;s just me that&rsquo;s sad.&rdquo; </p><p>The crow pecks lightly at Dan&rsquo;s nose. <i>You don&rsquo;t make people sad, Dan. </i></p><p>&ldquo;I feel like I disappoint people,&rdquo; Dan says, honestly. &ldquo;My parents. Beth. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll eventually disappoint Mona too. And Louise. I&rsquo;ve already disappointed one of the guests.&rdquo; </p><p>The crow stretches out one wing, and tucks its beak into the crook, then squawks, <i>people disappoint themselves. They expect things you cannot always provide. This is not your fault.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Dan considers the crow&rsquo;s point, staring into its mass of oil-slick feathers. A jet, beady eye pokes out, holding his gaze. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very wise.&rdquo;</p><p>The crow extends both wings. <i>And you are stronger than you know. </i></p><p>Before Dan can say anything else, the crow flaps its wings, beating gusts of cool air into Dan&rsquo;s face, and takes off, soaring into the pale sky. It flies higher and higher, until it&rsquo;s nothing but a black speck, and then out of view entirely. The snow is melting from his body heat beneath him, and he is beginning to sink down. For a moment, Dan is tempted to let himself be engulfed, to disappear into the white plains of this place. But he knows the crow is watching him, even from wherever it flew. The crow is waiting for Dan to move, to fight the feeling of unworthiness that&rsquo;s pushing him down. So, he sits up; the cold snow slides down his back. He grits his teeth, focused on a faraway melody, and stands. </p><p>Dan wakes up in his bed with a sense of vigour about him. His dream had been unusual, to say the least, but has instilled a determination in him. He&rsquo;s got the lay of the land now; he can run this place for forty-eight hours. There aren&rsquo;t even any guests to look after, aside from one. He gets ready quickly, shrouded in his new cape of confidence, and goes downstairs to set up for a likely needless breakfast. </p><p>As soon as he walks into the mezzanine lounge, he stops short at the sight of Phil Novokoric sat at one of the indoor tables, reading a book, a mug of coffee in his hand. The cape of confidence flies off Dan&rsquo;s shoulders, sweeping off into the stratosphere. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Good- good morning, Mr Novokoric,&rdquo; Dan manages, only stumbling slightly as he edges towards the kitchen. &ldquo;Um, Phil, I mean.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil lifts his head from his book, azure eyes glinting. &ldquo;Good morning, Dan.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve&hellip; already got a coffee, then?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil lifts an eyebrow, looking briefly down at the mug he&rsquo;s holding. &ldquo;It would appear so.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Dan says, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at the sarcasm. It takes a moment for the implication of this to sink in, given that Louise couldn&rsquo;t have made it for him, but when it does, Dan narrows his eyes. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an instant coffee,&rdquo; Phil says, wrinkling his nose. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says, then his stomach flips. He&rsquo;s going to have to ask, isn&rsquo;t he? Oh, crap. &ldquo;Would- would you like a macchiato?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil assesses him carefully, setting his book down. &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he says after a moment. </p><p>Oh no. Dan&rsquo;s been practicing like mad for two days with Louise, but he&rsquo;s still not totally confident about his aptitude with the coffee machine. Nevertheless, he&rsquo;s offered now, and he has to grant the request of the customer, no exceptions. Bracing himself for ridicule, or possibly just a sneer of contempt, Dan nods, and disappears into the kitchen.</p><p>He makes four different macchiatos, each of which seem to turn out slightly differently, much to his dismay. He tries to time the frothing of the milk, to clean the nozzle rigorously each time. In the end, he just selects the one that most resembles Louise&rsquo;s perfect macchiatos that she can seem to whip up without looking, and takes a deep breath before bringing it out to Phil. He&rsquo;s trembling as he places it down on the table, which Phil definitely notices, but doesn&rsquo;t comment on, thankfully. </p><p>Phil peers at the coffee, scrutinising, then brings it to his nose for a gentle sniff. &ldquo;Remembered the caramel this time, then,&rdquo; he mutters, and Dan only just stops himself from finding the caramel syrup in the kitchen and upending it over his head. </p><p>Phil takes a cautious sip, then another, and then an actual gulp. He lowers the mug, eyebrows raised, and places it carefully back on the table. Dan only realises he&rsquo;s hovering, watching Phil&rsquo;s reaction with hawk-like attention, when Phil fixes him with a bemused stare and says, &ldquo;thanks.&rdquo; </p><p>He turns his attention back to his book, and Dan realises he&rsquo;s being dismissed. &ldquo;Oh. No problem.&rdquo; </p><p>He steps back with an absurd little bow of his head; Phil might let out a tiny smile, but Dan can&rsquo;t be sure if it&rsquo;s because he thinks Dan&rsquo;s an idiot, or because of something amusing in his book. Either way, he needs to leave before he humiliates himself properly. He heads back into the kitchen and unearths one of Louise&rsquo;s homemade loaves of bread, which he then cuts four thick slices of. He toasts them under the grill, then spreads them with butter and plum jam. He puts two on one plate, and two on another, then carries them out of the kitchen. He places one plate down in front of Phil, who looks up in surprise, and then scurries downstairs to reception with his own plate before Phil can say anything. Dan eats his breakfast in between chores - sweeping the lobby, unlocking the doors, and setting up for the day. </p><p>Eventually, he runs out of things to do, and though he really would rather not go back upstairs and make more embarrassing small talk with Phil, he has no other choice. He picks up his empty plate from the desk, and heads back up to the mezzanine area. Mercifully, Phil&rsquo;s table is now devoid of Phil, though his book and mugs are still there. He&rsquo;s taken two bites out of one slice of toast. It&rsquo;s been a while though, so Dan assumes he must have finished, and takes the plate into the kitchen along with his own. It seems a waste to throw an entire untouched piece of toast into the bin, so Dan scoffs that one too, humming a Muse song as he chews, and washing plates. As he&rsquo;s swallowing the last bit, he hears the sound of a throat clearing, and turns, only slightly choking on toast crumbs, towards the noise. </p><p>Phil is at the serving hatch, his big crimson ski jacket on, and a faintly amused expression on his face. He pushes the two mugs across the hatch. &ldquo;What is that you&rsquo;re humming?&rdquo; He frowns, as if trying to place it. &ldquo;Sounds familiar.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a Muse song.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s hands are soapy, dripping at his sides. He shakes the suds off them, self-consciously. </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;Never liked Muse. All their songs sound the same.&rdquo; </p><p>Another reason to detest this fool. Clearly he has no taste in music. Aside from&hellip; classical, perhaps. </p><p>&ldquo;Each to their own,&rdquo; Dan says in an attempt at brightness, then walks over to collect the dirty mugs from him. Just as he turns to leave, Phil reaches out and catches Dan&rsquo;s wrist. It&rsquo;s a light, soft touch, and is gone again the next second, but Dan feels as if he&rsquo;s been zapped with 10,000 volts. He freezes, just about managing to hang onto the cups. &ldquo;Er-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come skiing with me,&rdquo; Phil says, knocking Dan out of orbit. </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a>!)</b></p>",

Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p>\n<p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a></p>\n<p><b>Chapter Five</b></p>\n<p>On Friday morning, after breakfast has been cleared, Mona is going over all of the things Dan needs to stay on top of over the weekend, when someone knocks on the front door. Both of them turn to the noise, obviously startled. They&rsquo;re 7,000 feet up the side of a mountain. Visitors aren&rsquo;t a frequent occurrence.<br /></p>\n<p>In the next moment, Mona gathers herself, smooths down her jacket lapels and goes to answer the door. As soon as she opens it, Kaspar bursts through, brandishing a pair of electric blue skis, a smallish parcel under his arm, and a pile of letters secured with string. </p>\n</p>",
