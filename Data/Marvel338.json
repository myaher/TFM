Never thought I\u2019d ever have anything in common with Iron Man, but then again, I never thought I\u2019d ever get back in the service after I lost Riley.</p><p>Rogers has a way of making you want to follow him wherever he may lead.

It\u2019s funny how those two idiots butt heads so often when they\u2019re the ones who have the most in common.</p><p>You wanna know why I chose to keep my wings, Colonel? Because it reminds me that I\u2019m not in this alone.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not flying up there alone.\u00a0</p><p>Because wings always come in pairs.</p><p>Captain America and Iron Man are two halves of that whole. The Avengers didn\u2019t fall apart because of the Accords, though there\u2019s not much I wouldn\u2019t give to kick Ross\u2019 ass myself; he\u2019s not much different from the HYDRA agents we took down in DC. He\u2019s branding and incarcerating and controlling people who are <i>different </i>because he\u2019s a Nazi through and through, and what do we do with Nazis, Colonel? Yeah that\u2019s right, we punch \u2018em in the face.\u00a0 And lemme just say how proud I am of you for finally standing up to that American Nazi a-hole. Took you awhile to get there, though I can\u2019t say I blame you, considering he\u2019s technically your boss.</p><p>Then again, your loyalty was never in the military, or even in the damn country. I know because I\u2019m exactly the same.\u00a0 We\u2019re both ready to commit treason for two idiots who are much too stubborn to admit how much they need each other.</p><p>The Accords isn\u2019t the reason why the Avengers fell apart\u2014it\u2019s because their leaders forgot that they come as a <i>pair.\u00a0</i></p><p>Wings have to be in sync in order to fly, after all.</p><p>And you know what, Rhodes?\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly why they need us, you and me.</p><p>I know you question it, sometimes. You know you\u2019re important to him, but you\u2019re not exactly sure what your place in Stark\u2019s life is. You don\u2019t even understand <i>why </i>you\u2019re important him, considering he\u2019s <i>Tony Stark. </i>He\u2019s <i>Iron Man. </i>It makes you wonder: why the hell does he still need <i>you</i>?</p><p>You wanna know how I know? Because I\u2019d often look at god damn Captain America and wonder why he still needs <i>me.</i></p><p>Iron Man may be Captain America\u2019s other half in the Avengers. But when it comes to the man behind the shield, Steve Rogers\u2026 his other half is undeniably his Sergeant. His best friend. Inseparable in both schoolyard and battlefield, like they say in the Smithsonian.</p><p>James Barnes is undeniably his ride or die. It ain\u2019t me, it ain\u2019t ever gonna be me, \u2018cause it had never been me in the first place. And I made my peace with that. Steve needs his Bucky in the same way Cap needs Iron Man, and I\u2019m just the guy who makes sure Rogers doesn\u2019t lose either of them.</p><p>Aren\u2019t you the same? Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re so protective of Potts, too? Because <i>she\u2019s </i>Stark\u2019s ride or die. Iron Man saves the world side by side with Captain America, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s Pepper whom Tony will always come home to.</p><p>So where does that leave us, Rhodes?</p><p>You know, when I lost Riley, I felt\u2026 unbalanced. Like I was hurtling through free fall except there\u2019s no ground to crash on.</p><p>Like I just lost half of my wings.</p><p><i>He</i> was my ride or die. And there had been a time when I seriously considered going down with him. Following him. When you lose your other half like that, what else do you have to live for?</p><p>Life has a pretty funny way of answering that question. \u2018Cause then\u2026 I met <i>you</i>.</p><p>It\u2019s funny because in our line of work, it\u2019s rare to meet someone with a similar life experience. Stark may be your best friend, but he ain\u2019t air force military, and you ain\u2019t no genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. And I may be Rogers\u2019 partner now, but he ain\u2019t a pararescue and I ain\u2019t a jacked up centenarian supersoldier who\u2019s been through World War II.</p><p>But you and I, Rhodes, we\u2019re war veterans who have fought through the conflicts of today, fighting for the people rather than the government or even the country, flying through the air and catching our brothers and sisters in arms from falling out of the sky.</p><p>Because this is what we do. We fly as right hand men, right behind our leaders, and make sure we cover their backs.\u00a0 We follow where they lead, because it\u2019s our job to protect them.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same with Stark and Rogers, but I look at life now as a before and after. Before, as Sam Wilson, my other half had always been Riley. It\u2019s why I\u2019d never trade my wings for anything, no matter how much Stark hard sells his own tech and offers to make me my own suit.\u00a0 Besides, I\u2019d never take that honour away from you. The fact that Stark gave you a suit like his is his unspoken declaration that you\u2019ll always be his wingman.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why I\u2019d always fly with my wings, because Riley will always be mine. I will always fly these wings in honour of his memory.</p><p>And after, as Falcon of the Avengers\u2026 my other half is <i>you</i>.</p><p>Because in this, now\u2026 you and I are the same. Two halves of the same set of wings.</p><p>And that\u2019s why I need you to keep flying. For Rogers, because he\u2019s now lost both me <i>and </i>Barnes; I do everything he does, only slower, which means he dives headfirst into grief a lot faster than I do, and I <i>know </i>how that feels like. You have to be there to stop him. You have to be there for Stark, because he needs you, and Rogers needs <i>him</i>, and I need\u2026 I need to know Steve will survive this.</p><p>I can\u2019t fail him the same way I failed Riley.</p><p>So hold on to those goggles for me, James, \u2018cause I\u2019m gonna need them when I fly again. Steve is gonna need his wingman back. And when I do, I swear\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna fail you either.</p><p>You need your other half back, too.</p><hr><p>(<a href=\"http://burnhamandtilly.tumblr.com/post/172241129173\" target=\"_blank\">insp</a>) (<a href=\"http://petite-madame.tumblr.com/post/174375246196/infinity-war-the-ones-we-leave-behind-2018-my\" target=\"_blank\">insp</a>)</p><p><b><i>part 3 of 10</i></b></p><p><a href=\"http://vindicatedtruth.tumblr.com/post/174823075469/the-living-tell-the-dying-not-to-leave-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">(</a><a href=\"http://vindicatedtruth.tumblr.com/post/174917710359/the-living-tell-the-dying-not-to-leave-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">prev</a>)</p>",

You don\u2019t even understand <i>why </i>you\u2019re important him, considering he\u2019s <i>Tony Stark. </i>He\u2019s <i>Iron Man. </i>It makes you wonder: why the hell does he still need <i>you</i>?</p><p>You wanna know how I know? Because I\u2019d often look at god damn Captain America and wonder why he still needs <i>me.</i></p><p>Iron Man may be Captain America\u2019s other half in the Avengers. But when it comes to the man behind the shield, Steve Rogers\u2026 his other half is undeniably his Sergeant. His best friend. Inseparable in both schoolyard and battlefield, like they say in the Smithsonian.</p><p>James Barnes is undeniably his ride or die. It ain\u2019t me, it ain\u2019t ever gonna be me, \u2018cause it had never been me in the first place. And I made my peace with that. Steve needs his Bucky in the same way Cap needs Iron Man, and I\u2019m just the guy who makes sure Rogers doesn\u2019t lose either of them.</p><p>Aren\u2019t you the same? Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re so protective of Potts, too? Because <i>she\u2019s </i>Stark\u2019s ride or die. Iron Man saves the world side by side with Captain America, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s Pepper whom Tony will always come home to.</p><p>So where does that leave us, Rhodes?</p><p>You know, when I lost Riley, I felt\u2026 unbalanced. Like I was hurtling through free fall except there\u2019s no ground to crash on.</p><p>Like I just lost half of my wings.</p><p><i>He</i> was my ride or die. And there had been a time when I seriously considered going down with him. Following him. When you lose your other half like that, what else do you have to live for?</p><p>Life has a pretty funny way of answering that question. \u2018Cause then\u2026 I met <i>you</i>.</p><p>It\u2019s funny because in our line of work, it\u2019s rare to meet someone with a similar life experience. Stark may be your best friend, but he ain\u2019t air force military, and you ain\u2019t no genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. And I may be Rogers\u2019 partner now, but he ain\u2019t a pararescue and I ain\u2019t a jacked up centenarian supersoldier who\u2019s been through World War II.</p><p>But you and I, Rhodes, we\u2019re war veterans who have fought through the conflicts of today, fighting for the people rather than the government or even the country, flying through the air and catching our brothers and sisters in arms from falling out of the sky.</p><p>Because this is what we do. We fly as right hand men, right behind our leaders, and make sure we cover their backs.\u00a0 We follow where they lead, because it\u2019s our job to protect them.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same with Stark and Rogers, but I look at life now as a before and after. Before, as Sam Wilson, my other half had always been Riley. It\u2019s why I\u2019d never trade my wings for anything, no matter how much Stark hard sells his own tech and offers to make me my own suit.\u00a0 Besides, I\u2019d never take that honour away from you. The fact that Stark gave you a suit like his is his unspoken declaration that you\u2019ll always be his wingman.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why I\u2019d always fly with my wings, because Riley will always be mine. I will always fly these wings in honour of his memory.</p><p>And after, as Falcon of the Avengers\u2026 my other half is <i>you</i>.</p><p>Because in this, now\u2026 you and I are the same. Two halves of the same set of wings.</p><p>And that\u2019s why I need you to keep flying. For Rogers, because he\u2019s now lost both me <i>and </i>Barnes; I do everything he does, only slower, which means he dives headfirst into grief a lot faster than I do, and I <i>know </i>how that feels like. You have to be there to stop him. You have to be there for Stark, because he needs you, and Rogers needs <i>him</i>, and I need\u2026 I need to know Steve will survive this.</p><p>I can\u2019t fail him the same way I failed Riley.</p><p>So hold on to those goggles for me, James, \u2018cause I\u2019m gonna need them when I fly again. Steve is gonna need his wingman back. And when I do, I swear\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna fail you either.</p><p>You need your other half back, too.</p><hr><p>(<a href=\"http://burnhamandtilly.tumblr.com/post/172241129173\" target=\"_blank\">insp</a>) (<a href=\"http://petite-madame.tumblr.com/post/174375246196/infinity-war-the-ones-we-leave-behind-2018-my\" target=\"_blank\">insp</a>)</p><p><b><i>part 3 of 10</i></b></p><p><a href=\"http://vindicatedtruth.tumblr.com/post/174823075469/the-living-tell-the-dying-not-to-leave-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">(</a><a href=\"http://vindicatedtruth.tumblr.com/post/174917710359/the-living-tell-the-dying-not-to-leave-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">prev</a>)</p>",

Two halves of the same set of wings.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s why I need you to keep flying. For Rogers, because he&rsquo;s now lost both me <i>and </i>Barnes; I do everything he does, only slower, which means he dives headfirst into grief a lot faster than I do, and I <i>know </i>how that feels like. You have to be there to stop him. You have to be there for Stark, because he needs you, and Rogers needs <i>him</i>, and I need&hellip; I need to know Steve will survive this.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t fail him the same way I failed Riley.</p><p>So hold on to those goggles for me, James, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m gonna need them when I fly again. Steve is gonna need his wingman back. And when I do, I swear&hellip; I&rsquo;m not gonna fail you either.</p><p>You need your other half back, too.</p><hr /><p>(<a href=\"http://burnhamandtilly.tumblr.com/post/172241129173\" target=\"_blank\">insp</a>) (<a href=\"http://petite-madame.tumblr.com/post/174375246196/infinity-war-the-ones-we-leave-behind-2018-my\" target=\"_blank\">insp</a>)</p><p><b><i>part 3 of 10</i></b></p><p><a href=\"http://vindicatedtruth.tumblr.com/post/174823075469/the-living-tell-the-dying-not-to-leave-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">(</a><a href=\"http://vindicatedtruth.tumblr.com/post/174917710359/the-living-tell-the-dying-not-to-leave-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">prev</a>)</p>",
