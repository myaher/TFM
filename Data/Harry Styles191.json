Her eyebrows were pinched together as she shifted to be more comfortable in the velvet armchair. \u201cI walked to the closest door, which led me to a long corridor. Standing at the other end was a shadow of a man. He was just standing there, like a statue, so I called for his help and started running to get to him, but no matter how hard I tried I always stayed in the same spot. Then suddenly, I fell down into a big black hole\u2026just keep falling\u2026falling\u2026until I see them again\u2026two flames in a pair of green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d her best friend Jason finally spoke to break the silence she left for him. \u201cAnd then you woke up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sighed. \u201cMy dreams, they always ended that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure those are the eyes in the King\u2019s portrait?\u201d Jason questioned and she could see the obvious doubt in his facial expression. He either thought she\u2019d been doing drugs or she was just out of her mind. However, the fear she had after waking up told her she had never been more sane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m 100% sure!\u201d Y/N asserted. \u201cThere\u2019s still one more thing I haven\u2019t told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles\u2019 got the same pair of eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, your boss?\u201d Jason tilted his head down and raised both eyebrows as he stared at his best friend in disbelief. She didn\u2019t reply with words, just gave him a slight shrug in return.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d he began. \u201cAre you seriously telling me your boss is the reason you\u2019re having these spooky dreams every night, and that he is somewhat related to the king who died like five centuries ago?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cLook\u2026I\u2019m not joking, I\u2019d never had those dreams before I started working for him.\u201d Now not only did she sound completely crazy, she also sounded obsessive.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just stressed that\u2019s all. Being a celebrity\u2019s personal assistant is a difficult job,\u201d Jason assumed, giving his friend a smile. \u201cDo you wanna go grab a coffee?\u201d</p><p>Y/N exhaled exhaustedly and rose from the chair, leaving Jason a bit disappointed, knowing beforehand that his offer had been declined. \u201cNope, sorry. I have a meeting with Harry\u2019s team to discuss his next tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is exactly what I was talking about! Your life has been all about Harry Styles for the past month, he\u2019s driving you insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the man does pay me to follow him everywhere so\u2026\u201d She paused and lifted her shoulders slightly \u201c\u2026if he\u2019s driving me insane, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Jason knew too well he couldn\u2019t convince her to quit her job for her mental health, so he just stayed quiet and watched her head to her room to get changed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He spoke after a while.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She hummed, her voice was muffled behind her closed door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the kiss\u2026\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to forgive me. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>He was holding his breath while waiting for a response (if she was gonna give him one). Maybe he should not have brought up this topic and just felt grateful to be the first person she\u2019d call for help.</p><p>Y/N exited her bedroom shortly after, wearing a white blouse and her favorite pair of high-waisted jeans. She stood at the door with her hands on her hips and shot him a smile.</p><p>\u201cJason, you\u2019re my best friend. I love you but only as a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin this friendship we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he repeated those two words, which sounded less depressing this time so she would take it as a good sign.</p><p>\u201cNow get up! You\u2019re giving me a ride!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Despite the look of surprise on her best friend\u2019s face,\u00a0Y/N picked up her bag and her coat then headed straight to the front door.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>It\u2019d been a week since Ann decided to stay at Court and she had started to get impatient. The King was taking too long to consider her simple requests. If it hadn\u2019t been for Edward, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have stayed that long.</i></p><p><i>She was well aware of her social status, a girl like her would never end up with a prince like him, but like her mother had once said, \u2019</i>you love who you love\u2019<i>. She couldn\u2019t be at fault for loving someone, right?</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut mother,\u201d Ann mumbled, watching Edward and his fianc\u00e9 in the garden from her room\u2019s window. \u201cWhat if the person you love doesn\u2019t love you in return?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her heart ached to the sound of her own question, to which she thought she might already know the answer. Therefore, Ann decided to try and focus on more important things rather than the fact that the man she loved was soon to be married. She took advantage of the absence of the guards outside her bedroom to sneak out and head into the woods.</i></p><p><i>Most people in the Kingdom would find the woods a very scary place. However, to Ann, the scariest place was the King\u2019s Court. She could handle hungry wolves lurking in the dark, not angry and malicious people wanting the blood of her kind to spill.</i></p><p><i>There were myths about witches being ugly old ladies with pointy noses, dark souls and black hearts, the ones that would cook you for dinner and put you in a curse just because they could. However, people like Ann were nothing like that. They were just unfortunate human-beings born with dark magic on the tips of their fingers, the gift they\u2019d never wished to possess. There were just a few families of witches in one village so as to not draw much attention. Once in a while, the young witches in an area would meet up to practice their spells and learn to have better control of their powers.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>There were a little cottage far in the woods, underneath of which was what they called \u2018the meeting hall\u2019. On the night Ann met Edward, she was on her way home from there.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAna darling! It\u2019s so good to see you again!\u201d Exclaimed an old witch when she saw the young girl. She took Ann by the hand and led her to the long table nearby, where sat a few others. Some were mixing potions, some were learning spells, some were putting them to practice.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cThese girls are only sixteen, seventeen.\u201d The old woman sighed contently as she held onto Ann\u2019s hand with both of hers. \u201cI remember when you first came here with your mother. How time flies.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Ann nodded, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear as she went on, \u201cI need your help, Madam Maggie.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it dear? You look distressed!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s about a man.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s always about men.\u201d Madam Maggie rolled her eyes, smiling to show her gold front tooth. \u201cAnn, darling, are you in love?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot with whom I\u2019m supposed to be in love with.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho\u2019s the lucky young man?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Prince.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnn!\u201d Madam Maggie gasped, looking around to make sure no one else could hear this conversation. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think I am! I don\u2019t know what to do! Is there a spell to erase my feelings for him? Or is there some kind of reverse love potion?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDarling, calm down!\u201d The old witch puckered up her forehead as she pursed her lips to think for a second or two. \u201cI\u2019m afraid magic cannot help you with this, at least not without consequences. But how do you know the prince? His father is a terrible man\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s nothing like his father! It\u2019s a long story, but I\u2019m\u2014\u201c</i></p><p><i>Without waiting for her to finish, Madam Maggie took her right hand and started observing her palm. Ann knew what she was doing, in fact, it was something Ann was capable of doing as well, telling someone\u2019s past, future, and present through their palm lines. The only downside to this was that you couldn\u2019t read your own palm, someone else had to do it for you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to help us by staying at Court!\u201d Madam Maggie widened her eyes at the girl in shock and terror. \u201cAnn, you\u2019ve got to leave as soon as possible!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy? W-What did you see?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTerrible things are going to happen if you stay for too long.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need to wait until the King&rsquo;s made up his mind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of life and death here Ann!\u201d That sentence put the young witch to silence immediately.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLife and death?\u201d She asked, unable to believe it was true. \u201cWhose?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYours.\u201d</i></p><p><i>For a second, Ann felt her entire body stiffen. Her face turned a shade lighter and her mouth fell open.\u00a0</i><i>\u201cI\u2019m going to die?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDifferent courses of actions can lead to different results, so I\u2019m not sure, I just don\u2019t think you should risk putting your own life in danger.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cEveryone\u2019s dying, it\u2019s the risk I have to take!\u201d Ann insisted, still the older witch didn\u2019t agree.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou cannot help anyone if something bad happen to you, darling. Leave the King\u2019s Court, and go home.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann looked down, frightened and at the same time downhearted. She couldn\u2019t\u00a0decide which one was worse: going home empty-handed, or never seeing Edward again, either way it would be too painful to bear.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><br/></p><p>The meeting finished shortly because Harry couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate.\u00a0They all agreed to meet up again the next morning to continue the discussions. Jeff was slightly mad, he didn\u2019t say it but everyone could tell. They assumed the reason for Harry\u2019s distraction was Lillie, his girlfriend, who had been caught cheating but they\u2019d got back together at the end of the day.\u00a0</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t Lillie, well, not entirely her, it was Y/N as well. It might sound weird to say his assistant had anything to do with him not being able to focus. Harry couldn\u2019t explain it himself, he just knew from the first moment he\u2019d met her, he couldn\u2019t shake her off his mind. Maybe it was the fact that after their first day spent together, she refused to talk to him about anything else besides business, and he loved talking to her much more than he could admit.</p><p>As the rest of Harry\u2019s team went out for lunch, he was left alone with Y/N. They were going to a fitting next for him to try on his new suits for a movie premiere, which he\u2019d be attending tomorrow night.</p><p>\u201cHey, Y/N,\u201d Harry spoke nervously as he tapped slightly on her shoulder. The girl turned around and stared at him with round eyes. \u201cWould you like to go to the studio with me later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your boss, I decide what task I want you to do.\u201d</p><p>Y/N snorted, raising an eyebrow at the man in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t use that tone on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Harry shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut for a second. He didn\u2019t know where that demanding tone of his came from. He\u2019d never been like that before, maybe he was just upset because she was acting so coldly towards him. \u201cI just can\u2019t write, I need someone to talk to I guess, makes me feel more at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your girlfriend? Maybe she\u2019ll be happy to help,\u201d she reminded him. Even though she\u2019d tried to not sound too bitter about it, she thought she might\u2019ve failed somehow.</p><p>\u201cLillie\u2019s busy today, the entire day. I&rsquo;m not even allowed to call her.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t say anything, just nodding her head, the thing she normally did when she was tired of hearing something and she just wanted it to be over.</p><p>\u201cThis is about me getting back together with her is it? You\u2019re not talking to me because of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am talking to you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this, I mean\u2026<i>really</i> talk,\u201d he explained then rolled his own eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not making sense but, I miss the conversations we had the day we first met, it\u2019s only been about work since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you want me to talk to you like a friend?\u201d She asked, holding the folders to her chest with both arms. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, your assistant would say you\u2019re so clever because she doesn\u2019t want to lose her job, in the role of your friend, I\u2019m saying that you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d she told him straightforward. \u201cYou got back together with a cheater. There are plenty of nice people around you Harry. You went around spreading the slogan <i>\u2018Treat people with kindness\u2019 </i>then ended up dating someone who treated you like you didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillie loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she? Or is it only you that love her?\u201d She shut him right up. He could only stare. \u201cDo you even love her, Harry? Are you just staying because you think you have to or what?\u201d</p><p>Harry actually stopped to think. She waited patiently as he did. Having only known this man for a month, Y/N cared about him way too much, more than she should. She really wanted him to be happy, and ever since he\u2019d got back together with Lillie he\u2019d been stressed. That was when you know the relationship was no longer valid.</p><p>Finally, Harry began,\u00a0\u201cyou have no idea how hard it is to find someone who\u2019s willing to stay with you for two long years despite everything. Lillie has sacrificed a lot to be with me. She told me her friend kissed her without her consent and I believed that. You should understand more than anyone because that\u2019s what happened with your best friend right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Maybe I prefer you as just my assistant.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned as soon as he finished that sentence and then stormed away, leaving her speechless. Little did she know, he regretted saying that immediately.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cEdward!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnn, how are you?\u201d Edward\u2019s eyes brightened the moment he saw Ann. She looked beautiful today, even more than yesterday, if it was possible. He hoped he wasn\u2019t showing how infatuated he was with her, but he was already smiling too wide to keep it hidden.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHave you spoken to your father?\u201d She asked, looking very worried. \u201cIt\u2019s been a month, more people are dying of hunger, and not to mention more witches are being burnt. You\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m still convincing him. I\u2019m trying my best Ann,\u201d he said, looking straight into her eyes. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, until he approves of abolishing the witch hunts, you\u2019re safe here at Court.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann shifted her eyes to her feet and Harry\u2019s heart fell with them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked, eyebrows pulled together as he laid a hand gently on her shoulder. \u201cWhy are you so upset?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf I don\u2019t have my answer from the King by morning, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow night, to go home. I don\u2019t feel safe here, your mother hates me, Princess Emili\u00e9 hates me, and your father\u2026he looks at me like I\u2019m a prey. Just&hellip;let me go home, at least I feel safer there.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou have me here, I\u2019ll keep you safe, love.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann took a step forward, taking his right hand in hers and brought it to her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be King one day, you have more important things to care about.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is as important as you,\u201d he told her softly, cupping her cheek with his other hand. There were no one around so he could just kiss her without worrying about her reputation or his own. However, he wouldn\u2019t do that, not until she wanted to.</i></p><p><i>Ann was taken aback by those words. She wanted to raise a question whether or not he felt the same as she did, but it didn\u2019t matter as she was going to leave.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs there another reason?\u201d He asked after a moment of silence. She couldn\u2019t look at him in the eyes, so that made him feel alarmed.\u00a0</i><i>Ann wanted to tell him the truth, but even herself wasn\u2019t sure what it was.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it me?\u201d Ironically, his question was the answer she was looking for. Yes. It was him. He was the reason she couldn\u2019t stay.\u00a0</i><i>\u201cAnn, please tell me\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married to a princess,\u201d was all she said before running off, ignoring him desperately calling after her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Whether he loved her, or he loved her not, they would never, </i>ever<i>, belong together.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><br/></p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t write.</p><p>It had happened before but this time it seemed worse. It was getting late and he was lying on the floor in his home studio, a pencil in his mouth, holding a notebook above his face. He had been staring at the blank page for an hour now, still&hellip;<i>nothing</i>. Maybe he was stressed, or maybe he wasn\u2019t inspired enough. It was a song about love, and he was in a relationship. It shouldn\u2019t have been difficult to write about love when you were <i>in love</i>!</p><p>The knock on the door caused Harry to sit up straight. He told the person to come in and Y/N opened the door, leaning her shoulder against the wooden frame as she stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you on the floor?\u201d She asked, raising an eyebrow but he just gave her a shrug and said nothing at all. \u201cI brought you the Gucci suit for the movie premiere, left it in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pressed her lips together and told him she would see him tomorrow morning before turning around. Before Harry could even think twice about what he was going to say, he opened his mouth and the words escaped all on their own.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was left speechless. She turned back, eyebrows knitted together, lips slightly parted but she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026stay here and talk to me for a while. I\u2019m under a lot of stress and I don\u2019t think my mind\u2019s working anymore,\u201d Harry sighed heavily while holding his head in his hand. \u201cI need to get to the chorus before tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can help,\u201d she responded softly and slowly, but the look on her face told him she was weighing her options.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d He hissed, looking up to lock eyes with her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said. I really don\u2019t want to be alone now. I\u2019m gonna go insane.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a couple seconds, which seemed like hours to Harry. Finally, she nodded her head, making him sigh in relief.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stay,\u201d the assistant said with a small smile as she closed the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a request from your boss, you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he told her out of guilt when she joined him on the floor. It was very demanding of him to ask her to stay here this late at night. She could just quit for this reason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here as your friend.\u201d She giggled, watching dimples appear on his cheeks. She might not notice, but it was the first time that day Harry genuinely smiled.</p><p>An hour passed by.</p><p>Then two hours.</p><p>Then three.</p><p>Then four\u2026</p><p>The two had been so lost in the conversations to realize how fast time flew. Harry had only known this girl for a month, yet he felt he had for much longer than that. He\u2019d told her a lot of things and she wasn\u2019t afraid to confide in him either. It was indeed a magical night, in the quiet room lit up by the moonlight, two lonely souls healed each other.</p><p>\u201cIs that your mum?\u201d Harry broke the silence when he saw her lockscreen when her phone lit up in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I lost her when I was fourteen, never got to know my dad.\u201d She laughed sadly staring at the phone though the screen had turned black and all she could see was her own reflection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never should\u2019ve brought her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I love talking about her, she\u2019s taught me so much in life.\u201d Y/N lifted her shoulders slightly and gave him a small smile. \u201cShe put so much trust in me. I just want to make her proud.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right, she must be so proud of how lost and clueless her daughter is in life.\u201d She rolled her eyes and exhaled a sarcastic laugh and expected him to react the same way. However, Harry\u2019s face remained serious.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re lost and clueless. You have a passion for painting, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you have something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise words from Mr. Harry Styles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She was beaming at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The silence sank in for a little while, they were just staring at everywhere else in the room but each other. Until Harry couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he had to be the first to speak, \u201ccan I ask you a very personal question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. What is it?\u201d</p><p><i>Have you been in love?</i></p><p>\u201cHarry, what is it? Don\u2019t just stare at me like that!\u201d Y/N snorted and Harry only smiled awkwardly. He had no idea where that question had come from. All he knew was that he was curious, or he was probably just searching for confirmation to be sure if her idea of being in love was the same as his, though honestly, now he wasn\u2019t so sure if he had an idea.\u00a0</p><p>He almost let it slip. Thank God he stopped himself just in time, for Harry knew such question would be too invasive, and she was still his employee despite him not seeing her as one.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about going to a movie premiere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to one so how do I know?! And it\u2019s not even a personal question, Harry!\u201d She tossed her head back and laughed, but then she was quick to notice the look on his face and realized what he was truly implying.\u00a0\u201cWait, are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I want you to go with Jeff and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m not a celebrity! There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun!&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I have nothing to wear!\u201d <i>That\u2019s a very good reason</i>, she thought to herself. The face of Gucci would not take someone so underdressed to a red carpet event with him, and she was sure the most expensive item in her closet was cheaper than the cheapest one in his.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about that if you say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say going to a movie premiere with me is part of your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overusing your powers!\u201d Y/N scoffed as she picked up a wrinkled ball of paper and tossed it at him playfully.</p><p>\u201cYou left me no choice but to bring out boss Harry!\u201d He defended himself, raising both hands in the air, cracking her up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d She pointed a finger at him and squinted her eyes. \u201cSo that\u2019s a maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll have your dress ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable!\u201d She rolled her eyes though there was no way she could hide the joy written on all over her face. He had made her day a thousand times better.</p><p>When the first ray of sunlight sneaked into the room through the gap between the window curtains, Harry and Y/N were still sitting on the floor with their backs against the wall. Harry had finished the first verse and chorus of his new song, and Y/N was still asleep, with her head on his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Sure he had got the work done before the deadline, which was worth to celebrate. Nevertheless, Harry didn\u2019t know what to feel, when the song which was supposed to be about the love of his life, wasn\u2019t inspired by his girlfriend of two years.</p><p>He carefully moved his head to the side and looked at his sleeping assistant who was subconsciously smiling in her sleep. Then he started to wonder, what would happen if she find out he\u2019d written a song about her.</p>",

Being a celebrity\u2019s personal assistant is a difficult job,\u201d Jason assumed, giving his friend a smile. \u201cDo you wanna go grab a coffee?\u201d</p><p>Y/N exhaled exhaustedly and rose from the chair, leaving Jason a bit disappointed, knowing beforehand that his offer had been declined. \u201cNope, sorry. I have a meeting with Harry\u2019s team to discuss his next tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is exactly what I was talking about! Your life has been all about Harry Styles for the past month, he\u2019s driving you insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the man does pay me to follow him everywhere so\u2026\u201d She paused and lifted her shoulders slightly \u201c\u2026if he\u2019s driving me insane, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Jason knew too well he couldn\u2019t convince her to quit her job for her mental health, so he just stayed quiet and watched her head to her room to get changed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He spoke after a while.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She hummed, her voice was muffled behind her closed door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the kiss\u2026\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to forgive me. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>He was holding his breath while waiting for a response (if she was gonna give him one). Maybe he should not have brought up this topic and just felt grateful to be the first person she\u2019d call for help.</p><p>Y/N exited her bedroom shortly after, wearing a white blouse and her favorite pair of high-waisted jeans. She stood at the door with her hands on her hips and shot him a smile.</p><p>\u201cJason, you\u2019re my best friend. I love you but only as a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin this friendship we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he repeated those two words, which sounded less depressing this time so she would take it as a good sign.</p><p>\u201cNow get up! You\u2019re giving me a ride!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Despite the look of surprise on her best friend\u2019s face,\u00a0Y/N picked up her bag and her coat then headed straight to the front door.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>It\u2019d been a week since Ann decided to stay at Court and she had started to get impatient. The King was taking too long to consider her simple requests. If it hadn\u2019t been for Edward, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have stayed that long.</i></p><p><i>She was well aware of her social status, a girl like her would never end up with a prince like him, but like her mother had once said, \u2019</i>you love who you love\u2019<i>. She couldn\u2019t be at fault for loving someone, right?</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut mother,\u201d Ann mumbled, watching Edward and his fianc\u00e9 in the garden from her room\u2019s window. \u201cWhat if the person you love doesn\u2019t love you in return?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her heart ached to the sound of her own question, to which she thought she might already know the answer. Therefore, Ann decided to try and focus on more important things rather than the fact that the man she loved was soon to be married. She took advantage of the absence of the guards outside her bedroom to sneak out and head into the woods.</i></p><p><i>Most people in the Kingdom would find the woods a very scary place. However, to Ann, the scariest place was the King\u2019s Court. She could handle hungry wolves lurking in the dark, not angry and malicious people wanting the blood of her kind to spill.</i></p><p><i>There were myths about witches being ugly old ladies with pointy noses, dark souls and black hearts, the ones that would cook you for dinner and put you in a curse just because they could. However, people like Ann were nothing like that. They were just unfortunate human-beings born with dark magic on the tips of their fingers, the gift they\u2019d never wished to possess. There were just a few families of witches in one village so as to not draw much attention. Once in a while, the young witches in an area would meet up to practice their spells and learn to have better control of their powers.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>There were a little cottage far in the woods, underneath of which was what they called \u2018the meeting hall\u2019. On the night Ann met Edward, she was on her way home from there.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAna darling! It\u2019s so good to see you again!\u201d Exclaimed an old witch when she saw the young girl. She took Ann by the hand and led her to the long table nearby, where sat a few others. Some were mixing potions, some were learning spells, some were putting them to practice.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cThese girls are only sixteen, seventeen.\u201d The old woman sighed contently as she held onto Ann\u2019s hand with both of hers. \u201cI remember when you first came here with your mother. How time flies.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Ann nodded, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear as she went on, \u201cI need your help, Madam Maggie.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it dear? You look distressed!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s about a man.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s always about men.\u201d Madam Maggie rolled her eyes, smiling to show her gold front tooth. \u201cAnn, darling, are you in love?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot with whom I\u2019m supposed to be in love with.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho\u2019s the lucky young man?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Prince.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnn!\u201d Madam Maggie gasped, looking around to make sure no one else could hear this conversation. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think I am! I don\u2019t know what to do! Is there a spell to erase my feelings for him? Or is there some kind of reverse love potion?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDarling, calm down!\u201d The old witch puckered up her forehead as she pursed her lips to think for a second or two. \u201cI\u2019m afraid magic cannot help you with this, at least not without consequences. But how do you know the prince? His father is a terrible man\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s nothing like his father! It\u2019s a long story, but I\u2019m\u2014\u201c</i></p><p><i>Without waiting for her to finish, Madam Maggie took her right hand and started observing her palm. Ann knew what she was doing, in fact, it was something Ann was capable of doing as well, telling someone\u2019s past, future, and present through their palm lines. The only downside to this was that you couldn\u2019t read your own palm, someone else had to do it for you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to help us by staying at Court!\u201d Madam Maggie widened her eyes at the girl in shock and terror. \u201cAnn, you\u2019ve got to leave as soon as possible!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy? W-What did you see?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTerrible things are going to happen if you stay for too long.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need to wait until the King\u2019s made up his mind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of life and death here Ann!\u201d That sentence put the young witch to silence immediately.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLife and death?\u201d She asked, unable to believe it was true. \u201cWhose?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYours.\u201d</i></p><p><i>For a second, Ann felt her entire body stiffen. Her face turned a shade lighter and her mouth fell open.\u00a0</i><i>\u201cI\u2019m going to die?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDifferent courses of actions can lead to different results, so I\u2019m not sure, I just don\u2019t think you should risk putting your own life in danger.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cEveryone\u2019s dying, it\u2019s the risk I have to take!\u201d Ann insisted, still the older witch didn\u2019t agree.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou cannot help anyone if something bad happen to you, darling. Leave the King\u2019s Court, and go home.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann looked down, frightened and at the same time downhearted. She couldn\u2019t\u00a0decide which one was worse: going home empty-handed, or never seeing Edward again, either way it would be too painful to bear.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting finished shortly because Harry couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate.\u00a0They all agreed to meet up again the next morning to continue the discussions. Jeff was slightly mad, he didn\u2019t say it but everyone could tell. They assumed the reason for Harry\u2019s distraction was Lillie, his girlfriend, who had been caught cheating but they\u2019d got back together at the end of the day.\u00a0</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t Lillie, well, not entirely her, it was Y/N as well. It might sound weird to say his assistant had anything to do with him not being able to focus. Harry couldn\u2019t explain it himself, he just knew from the first moment he\u2019d met her, he couldn\u2019t shake her off his mind. Maybe it was the fact that after their first day spent together, she refused to talk to him about anything else besides business, and he loved talking to her much more than he could admit.</p><p>As the rest of Harry\u2019s team went out for lunch, he was left alone with Y/N. They were going to a fitting next for him to try on his new suits for a movie premiere, which he\u2019d be attending tomorrow night.</p><p>\u201cHey, Y/N,\u201d Harry spoke nervously as he tapped slightly on her shoulder. The girl turned around and stared at him with round eyes. \u201cWould you like to go to the studio with me later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your boss, I decide what task I want you to do.\u201d</p><p>Y/N snorted, raising an eyebrow at the man in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t use that tone on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Harry shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut for a second. He didn\u2019t know where that demanding tone of his came from. He\u2019d never been like that before, maybe he was just upset because she was acting so coldly towards him. \u201cI just can\u2019t write, I need someone to talk to I guess, makes me feel more at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your girlfriend? Maybe she\u2019ll be happy to help,\u201d she reminded him. Even though she\u2019d tried to not sound too bitter about it, she thought she might\u2019ve failed somehow.</p><p>\u201cLillie\u2019s busy today, the entire day. I\u2019m not even allowed to call her.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t say anything, just nodding her head, the thing she normally did when she was tired of hearing something and she just wanted it to be over.</p><p>\u201cThis is about me getting back together with her is it? You\u2019re not talking to me because of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am talking to you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this, I mean\u2026<i>really</i> talk,\u201d he explained then rolled his own eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not making sense but, I miss the conversations we had the day we first met, it\u2019s only been about work since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you want me to talk to you like a friend?\u201d She asked, holding the folders to her chest with both arms. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, your assistant would say you\u2019re so clever because she doesn\u2019t want to lose her job, in the role of your friend, I\u2019m saying that you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d she told him straightforward. \u201cYou got back together with a cheater. There are plenty of nice people around you Harry. You went around spreading the slogan <i>\u2018Treat people with kindness\u2019 </i>then ended up dating someone who treated you like you didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillie loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she? Or is it only you that love her?\u201d She shut him right up. He could only stare. \u201cDo you even love her, Harry? Are you just staying because you think you have to or what?\u201d</p><p>Harry actually stopped to think. She waited patiently as he did. Having only known this man for a month, Y/N cared about him way too much, more than she should. She really wanted him to be happy, and ever since he\u2019d got back together with Lillie he\u2019d been stressed. That was when you know the relationship was no longer valid.</p><p>Finally, Harry began,\u00a0\u201cyou have no idea how hard it is to find someone who\u2019s willing to stay with you for two long years despite everything. Lillie has sacrificed a lot to be with me. She told me her friend kissed her without her consent and I believed that. You should understand more than anyone because that\u2019s what happened with your best friend right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Maybe I prefer you as just my assistant.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned as soon as he finished that sentence and then stormed away, leaving her speechless. Little did she know, he regretted saying that immediately.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>\u201cEdward!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnn, how are you?\u201d Edward\u2019s eyes brightened the moment he saw Ann. She looked beautiful today, even more than yesterday, if it was possible. He hoped he wasn\u2019t showing how infatuated he was with her, but he was already smiling too wide to keep it hidden.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHave you spoken to your father?\u201d She asked, looking very worried. \u201cIt\u2019s been a month, more people are dying of hunger, and not to mention more witches are being burnt. You\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m still convincing him. I\u2019m trying my best Ann,\u201d he said, looking straight into her eyes. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, until he approves of abolishing the witch hunts, you\u2019re safe here at Court.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann shifted her eyes to her feet and Harry\u2019s heart fell with them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked, eyebrows pulled together as he laid a hand gently on her shoulder. \u201cWhy are you so upset?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf I don\u2019t have my answer from the King by morning, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow night, to go home. I don\u2019t feel safe here, your mother hates me, Princess Emili\u00e9 hates me, and your father\u2026he looks at me like I\u2019m a prey. Just\u2026let me go home, at least I feel safer there.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou have me here, I\u2019ll keep you safe, love.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann took a step forward, taking his right hand in hers and brought it to her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be King one day, you have more important things to care about.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is as important as you,\u201d he told her softly, cupping her cheek with his other hand. There were no one around so he could just kiss her without worrying about her reputation or his own. However, he wouldn\u2019t do that, not until she wanted to.</i></p><p><i>Ann was taken aback by those words. She wanted to raise a question whether or not he felt the same as she did, but it didn\u2019t matter as she was going to leave.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs there another reason?\u201d He asked after a moment of silence. She couldn\u2019t look at him in the eyes, so that made him feel alarmed.\u00a0</i><i>Ann wanted to tell him the truth, but even herself wasn\u2019t sure what it was.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it me?\u201d Ironically, his question was the answer she was looking for. Yes. It was him. He was the reason she couldn\u2019t stay.\u00a0</i><i>\u201cAnn, please tell me\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married to a princess,\u201d was all she said before running off, ignoring him desperately calling after her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Whether he loved her, or he loved her not, they would never, </i>ever<i>, belong together.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t write.</p><p>It had happened before but this time it seemed worse. It was getting late and he was lying on the floor in his home studio, a pencil in his mouth, holding a notebook above his face. He had been staring at the blank page for an hour now, still\u2026<i>nothing</i>. Maybe he was stressed, or maybe he wasn\u2019t inspired enough. It was a song about love, and he was in a relationship. It shouldn\u2019t have been difficult to write about love when you were <i>in love</i>!</p><p>The knock on the door caused Harry to sit up straight. He told the person to come in and Y/N opened the door, leaning her shoulder against the wooden frame as she stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you on the floor?\u201d She asked, raising an eyebrow but he just gave her a shrug and said nothing at all. \u201cI brought you the Gucci suit for the movie premiere, left it in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pressed her lips together and told him she would see him tomorrow morning before turning around. Before Harry could even think twice about what he was going to say, he opened his mouth and the words escaped all on their own.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was left speechless. She turned back, eyebrows knitted together, lips slightly parted but she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026stay here and talk to me for a while. I\u2019m under a lot of stress and I don\u2019t think my mind\u2019s working anymore,\u201d Harry sighed heavily while holding his head in his hand. \u201cI need to get to the chorus before tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can help,\u201d she responded softly and slowly, but the look on her face told him she was weighing her options.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d He hissed, looking up to lock eyes with her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said. I really don\u2019t want to be alone now. I\u2019m gonna go insane.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a couple seconds, which seemed like hours to Harry. Finally, she nodded her head, making him sigh in relief.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stay,\u201d the assistant said with a small smile as she closed the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a request from your boss, you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he told her out of guilt when she joined him on the floor. It was very demanding of him to ask her to stay here this late at night. She could just quit for this reason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here as your friend.\u201d She giggled, watching dimples appear on his cheeks. She might not notice, but it was the first time that day Harry genuinely smiled.</p><p>An hour passed by.</p><p>Then two hours.</p><p>Then three.</p><p>Then four\u2026</p><p>The two had been so lost in the conversations to realize how fast time flew. Harry had only known this girl for a month, yet he felt he had for much longer than that. He\u2019d told her a lot of things and she wasn\u2019t afraid to confide in him either. It was indeed a magical night, in the quiet room lit up by the moonlight, two lonely souls healed each other.</p><p>\u201cIs that your mum?\u201d Harry broke the silence when he saw her lockscreen when her phone lit up in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I lost her when I was fourteen, never got to know my dad.\u201d She laughed sadly staring at the phone though the screen had turned black and all she could see was her own reflection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never should\u2019ve brought her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I love talking about her, she\u2019s taught me so much in life.\u201d Y/N lifted her shoulders slightly and gave him a small smile. \u201cShe put so much trust in me. I just want to make her proud.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right, she must be so proud of how lost and clueless her daughter is in life.\u201d She rolled her eyes and exhaled a sarcastic laugh and expected him to react the same way. However, Harry\u2019s face remained serious.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re lost and clueless. You have a passion for painting, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you have something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise words from Mr. Harry Styles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She was beaming at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The silence sank in for a little while, they were just staring at everywhere else in the room but each other. Until Harry couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he had to be the first to speak, \u201ccan I ask you a very personal question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. What is it?\u201d</p><p><i>Have you been in love?</i></p><p>\u201cHarry, what is it? Don\u2019t just stare at me like that!\u201d Y/N snorted and Harry only smiled awkwardly. He had no idea where that question had come from. All he knew was that he was curious, or he was probably just searching for confirmation to be sure if her idea of being in love was the same as his, though honestly, now he wasn\u2019t so sure if he had an idea.\u00a0</p><p>He almost let it slip. Thank God he stopped himself just in time, for Harry knew such question would be too invasive, and she was still his employee despite him not seeing her as one.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about going to a movie premiere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to one so how do I know?! And it\u2019s not even a personal question, Harry!\u201d She tossed her head back and laughed, but then she was quick to notice the look on his face and realized what he was truly implying.\u00a0\u201cWait, are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I want you to go with Jeff and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m not a celebrity! There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun!\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I have nothing to wear!\u201d <i>That\u2019s a very good reason</i>, she thought to herself. The face of Gucci would not take someone so underdressed to a red carpet event with him, and she was sure the most expensive item in her closet was cheaper than the cheapest one in his.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about that if you say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say going to a movie premiere with me is part of your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overusing your powers!\u201d Y/N scoffed as she picked up a wrinkled ball of paper and tossed it at him playfully.</p><p>\u201cYou left me no choice but to bring out boss Harry!\u201d He defended himself, raising both hands in the air, cracking her up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d She pointed a finger at him and squinted her eyes. \u201cSo that\u2019s a maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll have your dress ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable!\u201d She rolled her eyes though there was no way she could hide the joy written on all over her face. He had made her day a thousand times better.</p><p>When the first ray of sunlight sneaked into the room through the gap between the window curtains, Harry and Y/N were still sitting on the floor with their backs against the wall. Harry had finished the first verse and chorus of his new song, and Y/N was still asleep, with her head on his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Sure he had got the work done before the deadline, which was worth to celebrate. Nevertheless, Harry didn\u2019t know what to feel, when the song which was supposed to be about the love of his life, wasn\u2019t inspired by his girlfriend of two years.</p><p>He carefully moved his head to the side and looked at his sleeping assistant who was subconsciously smiling in her sleep. Then he started to wonder, what would happen if she find out he\u2019d written a song about her.</p></p>",

Her eyebrows were pinched together as she shifted to be more comfortable in the velvet armchair. \u201cI walked to the closest door, which led me to a long corridor. Standing at the other end was a shadow of a man. He was just standing there, like a statue, so I called for his help and started running to get to him, but no matter how hard I tried I always stayed in the same spot. Then suddenly, I fell down into a big black hole\u2026just keep falling\u2026falling\u2026until I see them again\u2026two flames in a pair of green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d her best friend Jason finally spoke to break the silence she left for him. \u201cAnd then you woke up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sighed. \u201cMy dreams, they always ended that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure those are the eyes in the King\u2019s portrait?\u201d Jason questioned and she could see the obvious doubt in his facial expression. He either thought she\u2019d been doing drugs or she was just out of her mind. However, the fear she had after waking up told her she had never been more sane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m 100% sure!\u201d Y/N asserted. \u201cThere\u2019s still one more thing I haven\u2019t told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles\u2019 got the same pair of eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, your boss?\u201d Jason tilted his head down and raised both eyebrows as he stared at his best friend in disbelief. She didn\u2019t reply with words, just gave him a slight shrug in return.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d he began. \u201cAre you seriously telling me your boss is the reason you\u2019re having these spooky dreams every night, and that he is somewhat related to the king who died like five centuries ago?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cLook\u2026I\u2019m not joking, I\u2019d never had those dreams before I started working for him.\u201d Now not only did she sound completely crazy, she also sounded obsessive.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just stressed that\u2019s all. Being a celebrity\u2019s personal assistant is a difficult job,\u201d Jason assumed, giving his friend a smile. \u201cDo you wanna go grab a coffee?\u201d</p><p>Y/N exhaled exhaustedly and rose from the chair, leaving Jason a bit disappointed, knowing beforehand that his offer had been declined. \u201cNope, sorry. I have a meeting with Harry\u2019s team to discuss his next tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is exactly what I was talking about! Your life has been all about Harry Styles for the past month, he\u2019s driving you insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the man does pay me to follow him everywhere so\u2026\u201d She paused and lifted her shoulders slightly \u201c\u2026if he\u2019s driving me insane, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Jason knew too well he couldn\u2019t convince her to quit her job for her mental health, so he just stayed quiet and watched her head to her room to get changed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He spoke after a while.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She hummed, her voice was muffled behind her closed door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the kiss\u2026\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to forgive me. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>He was holding his breath while waiting for a response (if she was gonna give him one). Maybe he should not have brought up this topic and just felt grateful to be the first person she\u2019d call for help.</p><p>Y/N exited her bedroom shortly after, wearing a white blouse and her favorite pair of high-waisted jeans. She stood at the door with her hands on her hips and shot him a smile.</p><p>\u201cJason, you\u2019re my best friend. I love you but only as a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin this friendship we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he repeated those two words, which sounded less depressing this time so she would take it as a good sign.</p><p>\u201cNow get up! You\u2019re giving me a ride!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Despite the look of surprise on her best friend\u2019s face,\u00a0Y/N picked up her bag and her coat then headed straight to the front door.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>It\u2019d been a week since Ann decided to stay at Court and she had started to get impatient. The King was taking too long to consider her simple requests. If it hadn\u2019t been for Edward, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have stayed that long.</i></p><p><i>She was well aware of her social status, a girl like her would never end up with a prince like him, but like her mother had once said, \u2019</i>you love who you love\u2019<i>. She couldn\u2019t be at fault for loving someone, right?</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut mother,\u201d Ann mumbled, watching Edward and his fianc\u00e9 in the garden from her room\u2019s window. \u201cWhat if the person you love doesn\u2019t love you in return?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her heart ached to the sound of her own question, to which she thought she might already know the answer. Therefore, Ann decided to try and focus on more important things rather than the fact that the man she loved was soon to be married. She took advantage of the absence of the guards outside her bedroom to sneak out and head into the woods.</i></p><p><i>Most people in the Kingdom would find the woods a very scary place. However, to Ann, the scariest place was the King\u2019s Court. She could handle hungry wolves lurking in the dark, not angry and malicious people wanting the blood of her kind to spill.</i></p><p><i>There were myths about witches being ugly old ladies with pointy noses, dark souls and black hearts, the ones that would cook you for dinner and put you in a curse just because they could. However, people like Ann were nothing like that. They were just unfortunate human-beings born with dark magic on the tips of their fingers, the gift they\u2019d never wished to possess. There were just a few families of witches in one village so as to not draw much attention. Once in a while, the young witches in an area would meet up to practice their spells and learn to have better control of their powers.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>There were a little cottage far in the woods, underneath of which was what they called \u2018the meeting hall\u2019. On the night Ann met Edward, she was on her way home from there.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAna darling! It\u2019s so good to see you again!\u201d Exclaimed an old witch when she saw the young girl. She took Ann by the hand and led her to the long table nearby, where sat a few others. Some were mixing potions, some were learning spells, some were putting them to practice.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cThese girls are only sixteen, seventeen.\u201d The old woman sighed contently as she held onto Ann\u2019s hand with both of hers. \u201cI remember when you first came here with your mother. How time flies.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Ann nodded, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear as she went on, \u201cI need your help, Madam Maggie.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it dear? You look distressed!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s about a man.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s always about men.\u201d Madam Maggie rolled her eyes, smiling to show her gold front tooth. \u201cAnn, darling, are you in love?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot with whom I\u2019m supposed to be in love with.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho\u2019s the lucky young man?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Prince.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnn!\u201d Madam Maggie gasped, looking around to make sure no one else could hear this conversation. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think I am! I don\u2019t know what to do! Is there a spell to erase my feelings for him? Or is there some kind of reverse love potion?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDarling, calm down!\u201d The old witch puckered up her forehead as she pursed her lips to think for a second or two. \u201cI\u2019m afraid magic cannot help you with this, at least not without consequences. But how do you know the prince? His father is a terrible man\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s nothing like his father! It\u2019s a long story, but I\u2019m\u2014\u201c</i></p><p><i>Without waiting for her to finish, Madam Maggie took her right hand and started observing her palm. Ann knew what she was doing, in fact, it was something Ann was capable of doing as well, telling someone\u2019s past, future, and present through their palm lines. The only downside to this was that you couldn\u2019t read your own palm, someone else had to do it for you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to help us by staying at Court!\u201d Madam Maggie widened her eyes at the girl in shock and terror. \u201cAnn, you\u2019ve got to leave as soon as possible!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy? W-What did you see?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTerrible things are going to happen if you stay for too long.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need to wait until the King\u2019s made up his mind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of life and death here Ann!\u201d That sentence put the young witch to silence immediately.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLife and death?\u201d She asked, unable to believe it was true. \u201cWhose?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYours.\u201d</i></p><p><i>For a second, Ann felt her entire body stiffen. Her face turned a shade lighter and her mouth fell open.\u00a0</i><i>\u201cI\u2019m going to die?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDifferent courses of actions can lead to different results, so I\u2019m not sure, I just don\u2019t think you should risk putting your own life in danger.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cEveryone\u2019s dying, it\u2019s the risk I have to take!\u201d Ann insisted, still the older witch didn\u2019t agree.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou cannot help anyone if something bad happen to you, darling. Leave the King\u2019s Court, and go home.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann looked down, frightened and at the same time downhearted. She couldn\u2019t\u00a0decide which one was worse: going home empty-handed, or never seeing Edward again, either way it would be too painful to bear.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting finished shortly because Harry couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate.\u00a0They all agreed to meet up again the next morning to continue the discussions. Jeff was slightly mad, he didn\u2019t say it but everyone could tell. They assumed the reason for Harry\u2019s distraction was Lillie, his girlfriend, who had been caught cheating but they\u2019d got back together at the end of the day.\u00a0</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t Lillie, well, not entirely her, it was Y/N as well. It might sound weird to say his assistant had anything to do with him not being able to focus. Harry couldn\u2019t explain it himself, he just knew from the first moment he\u2019d met her, he couldn\u2019t shake her off his mind. Maybe it was the fact that after their first day spent together, she refused to talk to him about anything else besides business, and he loved talking to her much more than he could admit.</p><p>As the rest of Harry\u2019s team went out for lunch, he was left alone with Y/N. They were going to a fitting next for him to try on his new suits for a movie premiere, which he\u2019d be attending tomorrow night.</p><p>\u201cHey, Y/N,\u201d Harry spoke nervously as he tapped slightly on her shoulder. The girl turned around and stared at him with round eyes. \u201cWould you like to go to the studio with me later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your boss, I decide what task I want you to do.\u201d</p><p>Y/N snorted, raising an eyebrow at the man in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t use that tone on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Harry shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut for a second. He didn\u2019t know where that demanding tone of his came from. He\u2019d never been like that before, maybe he was just upset because she was acting so coldly towards him. \u201cI just can\u2019t write, I need someone to talk to I guess, makes me feel more at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your girlfriend? Maybe she\u2019ll be happy to help,\u201d she reminded him. Even though she\u2019d tried to not sound too bitter about it, she thought she might\u2019ve failed somehow.</p><p>\u201cLillie\u2019s busy today, the entire day. I\u2019m not even allowed to call her.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t say anything, just nodding her head, the thing she normally did when she was tired of hearing something and she just wanted it to be over.</p><p>\u201cThis is about me getting back together with her is it? You\u2019re not talking to me because of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am talking to you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this, I mean\u2026<i>really</i> talk,\u201d he explained then rolled his own eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not making sense but, I miss the conversations we had the day we first met, it\u2019s only been about work since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you want me to talk to you like a friend?\u201d She asked, holding the folders to her chest with both arms. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, your assistant would say you\u2019re so clever because she doesn\u2019t want to lose her job, in the role of your friend, I\u2019m saying that you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d she told him straightforward. \u201cYou got back together with a cheater. There are plenty of nice people around you Harry. You went around spreading the slogan <i>\u2018Treat people with kindness\u2019 </i>then ended up dating someone who treated you like you didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillie loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she? Or is it only you that love her?\u201d She shut him right up. He could only stare. \u201cDo you even love her, Harry? Are you just staying because you think you have to or what?\u201d</p><p>Harry actually stopped to think. She waited patiently as he did. Having only known this man for a month, Y/N cared about him way too much, more than she should. She really wanted him to be happy, and ever since he\u2019d got back together with Lillie he\u2019d been stressed. That was when you know the relationship was no longer valid.</p><p>Finally, Harry began,\u00a0\u201cyou have no idea how hard it is to find someone who\u2019s willing to stay with you for two long years despite everything. Lillie has sacrificed a lot to be with me. She told me her friend kissed her without her consent and I believed that. You should understand more than anyone because that\u2019s what happened with your best friend right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Maybe I prefer you as just my assistant.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned as soon as he finished that sentence and then stormed away, leaving her speechless. Little did she know, he regretted saying that immediately.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>\u201cEdward!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnn, how are you?\u201d Edward\u2019s eyes brightened the moment he saw Ann. She looked beautiful today, even more than yesterday, if it was possible. He hoped he wasn\u2019t showing how infatuated he was with her, but he was already smiling too wide to keep it hidden.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHave you spoken to your father?\u201d She asked, looking very worried. \u201cIt\u2019s been a month, more people are dying of hunger, and not to mention more witches are being burnt. You\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m still convincing him. I\u2019m trying my best Ann,\u201d he said, looking straight into her eyes. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, until he approves of abolishing the witch hunts, you\u2019re safe here at Court.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann shifted her eyes to her feet and Harry\u2019s heart fell with them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked, eyebrows pulled together as he laid a hand gently on her shoulder. \u201cWhy are you so upset?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf I don\u2019t have my answer from the King by morning, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow night, to go home. I don\u2019t feel safe here, your mother hates me, Princess Emili\u00e9 hates me, and your father\u2026he looks at me like I\u2019m a prey. Just\u2026let me go home, at least I feel safer there.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou have me here, I\u2019ll keep you safe, love.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Ann took a step forward, taking his right hand in hers and brought it to her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be King one day, you have more important things to care about.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is as important as you,\u201d he told her softly, cupping her cheek with his other hand. There were no one around so he could just kiss her without worrying about her reputation or his own. However, he wouldn\u2019t do that, not until she wanted to.</i></p><p><i>Ann was taken aback by those words. She wanted to raise a question whether or not he felt the same as she did, but it didn\u2019t matter as she was going to leave.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs there another reason?\u201d He asked after a moment of silence. She couldn\u2019t look at him in the eyes, so that made him feel alarmed.\u00a0</i><i>Ann wanted to tell him the truth, but even herself wasn\u2019t sure what it was.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it me?\u201d Ironically, his question was the answer she was looking for. Yes. It was him. He was the reason she couldn\u2019t stay.\u00a0</i><i>\u201cAnn, please tell me\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married to a princess,\u201d was all she said before running off, ignoring him desperately calling after her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Whether he loved her, or he loved her not, they would never, </i>ever<i>, belong together.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t write.</p><p>It had happened before but this time it seemed worse. It was getting late and he was lying on the floor in his home studio, a pencil in his mouth, holding a notebook above his face. He had been staring at the blank page for an hour now, still\u2026<i>nothing</i>. Maybe he was stressed, or maybe he wasn\u2019t inspired enough. It was a song about love, and he was in a relationship. It shouldn\u2019t have been difficult to write about love when you were <i>in love</i>!</p><p>The knock on the door caused Harry to sit up straight. He told the person to come in and Y/N opened the door, leaning her shoulder against the wooden frame as she stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you on the floor?\u201d She asked, raising an eyebrow but he just gave her a shrug and said nothing at all. \u201cI brought you the Gucci suit for the movie premiere, left it in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pressed her lips together and told him she would see him tomorrow morning before turning around. Before Harry could even think twice about what he was going to say, he opened his mouth and the words escaped all on their own.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was left speechless. She turned back, eyebrows knitted together, lips slightly parted but she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026stay here and talk to me for a while. I\u2019m under a lot of stress and I don\u2019t think my mind\u2019s working anymore,\u201d Harry sighed heavily while holding his head in his hand. \u201cI need to get to the chorus before tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can help,\u201d she responded softly and slowly, but the look on her face told him she was weighing her options.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d He hissed, looking up to lock eyes with her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said. I really don\u2019t want to be alone now. I\u2019m gonna go insane.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a couple seconds, which seemed like hours to Harry. Finally, she nodded her head, making him sigh in relief.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stay,\u201d the assistant said with a small smile as she closed the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a request from your boss, you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he told her out of guilt when she joined him on the floor. It was very demanding of him to ask her to stay here this late at night. She could just quit for this reason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here as your friend.\u201d She giggled, watching dimples appear on his cheeks. She might not notice, but it was the first time that day Harry genuinely smiled.</p><p>An hour passed by.</p><p>Then two hours.</p><p>Then three.</p><p>Then four\u2026</p><p>The two had been so lost in the conversations to realize how fast time flew. Harry had only known this girl for a month, yet he felt he had for much longer than that. He\u2019d told her a lot of things and she wasn\u2019t afraid to confide in him either. It was indeed a magical night, in the quiet room lit up by the moonlight, two lonely souls healed each other.</p><p>\u201cIs that your mum?\u201d Harry broke the silence when he saw her lockscreen when her phone lit up in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I lost her when I was fourteen, never got to know my dad.\u201d She laughed sadly staring at the phone though the screen had turned black and all she could see was her own reflection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never should\u2019ve brought her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I love talking about her, she\u2019s taught me so much in life.\u201d Y/N lifted her shoulders slightly and gave him a small smile. \u201cShe put so much trust in me. I just want to make her proud.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right, she must be so proud of how lost and clueless her daughter is in life.\u201d She rolled her eyes and exhaled a sarcastic laugh and expected him to react the same way. However, Harry\u2019s face remained serious.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re lost and clueless. You have a passion for painting, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you have something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise words from Mr. Harry Styles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She was beaming at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The silence sank in for a little while, they were just staring at everywhere else in the room but each other. Until Harry couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he had to be the first to speak, \u201ccan I ask you a very personal question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. What is it?\u201d</p><p><i>Have you been in love?</i></p><p>\u201cHarry, what is it? Don\u2019t just stare at me like that!\u201d Y/N snorted and Harry only smiled awkwardly. He had no idea where that question had come from. All he knew was that he was curious, or he was probably just searching for confirmation to be sure if her idea of being in love was the same as his, though honestly, now he wasn\u2019t so sure if he had an idea.\u00a0</p><p>He almost let it slip. Thank God he stopped himself just in time, for Harry knew such question would be too invasive, and she was still his employee despite him not seeing her as one.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about going to a movie premiere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to one so how do I know?! And it\u2019s not even a personal question, Harry!\u201d She tossed her head back and laughed, but then she was quick to notice the look on his face and realized what he was truly implying.\u00a0\u201cWait, are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I want you to go with Jeff and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m not a celebrity! There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun!\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I have nothing to wear!\u201d <i>That\u2019s a very good reason</i>, she thought to herself. The face of Gucci would not take someone so underdressed to a red carpet event with him, and she was sure the most expensive item in her closet was cheaper than the cheapest one in his.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about that if you say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say going to a movie premiere with me is part of your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overusing your powers!\u201d Y/N scoffed as she picked up a wrinkled ball of paper and tossed it at him playfully.</p><p>\u201cYou left me no choice but to bring out boss Harry!\u201d He defended himself, raising both hands in the air, cracking her up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d She pointed a finger at him and squinted her eyes. \u201cSo that\u2019s a maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll have your dress ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable!\u201d She rolled her eyes though there was no way she could hide the joy written on all over her face. He had made her day a thousand times better.</p><p>When the first ray of sunlight sneaked into the room through the gap between the window curtains, Harry and Y/N were still sitting on the floor with their backs against the wall. Harry had finished the first verse and chorus of his new song, and Y/N was still asleep, with her head on his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Sure he had got the work done before the deadline, which was worth to celebrate. Nevertheless, Harry didn\u2019t know what to feel, when the song which was supposed to be about the love of his life, wasn\u2019t inspired by his girlfriend of two years.</p><p>He carefully moved his head to the side and looked at his sleeping assistant who was subconsciously smiling in her sleep. Then he started to wonder, what would happen if she find out he\u2019d written a song about her.</p></p>",

Her eyebrows were pinched together as she shifted to be more comfortable in the velvet armchair. &ldquo;I walked to the closest door, which led me to a long corridor. Standing at the other end was a shadow of a man. He was just standing there, like a statue, so I called for his help and started running to get to him, but no matter how hard I tried I always stayed in the same spot. Then suddenly, I fell down into a big black hole&hellip;just keep falling&hellip;falling&hellip;until I see them again&hellip;two flames in a pair of green eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;&rdquo; her best friend Jason finally spoke to break the silence she left for him. &ldquo;And then you woke up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;My dreams, they always ended that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure those are the eyes in the King&rsquo;s portrait?&rdquo; Jason questioned and she could see the obvious doubt in his facial expression. He either thought she&rsquo;d been doing drugs or she was just out of her mind. However, the fear she had after waking up told her she had never been more sane.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 100% sure!&rdquo; Y/N asserted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still one more thing I haven&rsquo;t told you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry Styles&rsquo; got the same pair of eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, your boss?&rdquo; Jason tilted his head down and raised both eyebrows as he stared at his best friend in disbelief. She didn&rsquo;t reply with words, just gave him a slight shrug in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Are you seriously telling me your boss is the reason you&rsquo;re having these spooky dreams every night, and that he is somewhat related to the king who died like five centuries ago?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look&hellip;I&rsquo;m not joking, I&rsquo;d never had those dreams before I started working for him.&rdquo; Now not only did she sound completely crazy, she also sounded obsessive.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re just stressed that&rsquo;s all. Being a celebrity&rsquo;s personal assistant is a difficult job,&rdquo; Jason assumed, giving his friend a smile. &ldquo;Do you wanna go grab a coffee?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N exhaled exhaustedly and rose from the chair, leaving Jason a bit disappointed, knowing beforehand that his offer had been declined. &ldquo;Nope, sorry. I have a meeting with Harry&rsquo;s team to discuss his next tour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is exactly what I was talking about! Your life has been all about Harry Styles for the past month, he&rsquo;s driving you insane.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, the man does pay me to follow him everywhere so&hellip;&rdquo; She paused and lifted her shoulders slightly &ldquo;&hellip;if he&rsquo;s driving me insane, so be it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jason knew too well he couldn&rsquo;t convince her to quit her job for her mental health, so he just stayed quiet and watched her head to her room to get changed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; He spoke after a while.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; She hummed, her voice was muffled behind her closed door.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about the kiss&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you decided to forgive me. I won&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p><p>He was holding his breath while waiting for a response (if she was gonna give him one). Maybe he should not have brought up this topic and just felt grateful to be the first person she&rsquo;d call for help.</p><p>Y/N exited her bedroom shortly after, wearing a white blouse and her favorite pair of high-waisted jeans. She stood at the door with her hands on her hips and shot him a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Jason, you&rsquo;re my best friend. I love you but only as a friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to ruin this friendship we have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he repeated those two words, which sounded less depressing this time so she would take it as a good sign.</p><p>&ldquo;Now get up! You&rsquo;re giving me a ride!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the look of surprise on her best friend&rsquo;s face,&nbsp;Y/N picked up her bag and her coat then headed straight to the front door.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>It&rsquo;d been a week since Ann decided to stay at Court and she had started to get impatient. The King was taking too long to consider her simple requests. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Edward, maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t have stayed that long.</i></p><p><i>She was well aware of her social status, a girl like her would never end up with a prince like him, but like her mother had once said, &rsquo;</i>you love who you love&rsquo;<i>. She couldn&rsquo;t be at fault for loving someone, right?</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But mother,&rdquo; Ann mumbled, watching Edward and his fianc&eacute; in the garden from her room&rsquo;s window. &ldquo;What if the person you love doesn&rsquo;t love you in return?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Her heart ached to the sound of her own question, to which she thought she might already know the answer. Therefore, Ann decided to try and focus on more important things rather than the fact that the man she loved was soon to be married. She took advantage of the absence of the guards outside her bedroom to sneak out and head into the woods.</i></p><p><i>Most people in the Kingdom would find the woods a very scary place. However, to Ann, the scariest place was the King&rsquo;s Court. She could handle hungry wolves lurking in the dark, not angry and malicious people wanting the blood of her kind to spill.</i></p><p><i>There were myths about witches being ugly old ladies with pointy noses, dark souls and black hearts, the ones that would cook you for dinner and put you in a curse just because they could. However, people like Ann were nothing like that. They were just unfortunate human-beings born with dark magic on the tips of their fingers, the gift they&rsquo;d never wished to possess. There were just a few families of witches in one village so as to not draw much attention. Once in a while, the young witches in an area would meet up to practice their spells and learn to have better control of their powers.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>There were a little cottage far in the woods, underneath of which was what they called &lsquo;the meeting hall&rsquo;. On the night Ann met Edward, she was on her way home from there.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ana darling! It&rsquo;s so good to see you again!&rdquo; Exclaimed an old witch when she saw the young girl. She took Ann by the hand and led her to the long table nearby, where sat a few others. Some were mixing potions, some were learning spells, some were putting them to practice.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;These girls are only sixteen, seventeen.&rdquo; The old woman sighed contently as she held onto Ann&rsquo;s hand with both of hers. &ldquo;I remember when you first came here with your mother. How time flies.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Ann nodded, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear as she went on, &ldquo;I need your help, Madam Maggie.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What is it dear? You look distressed!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well&hellip;it&rsquo;s about a man.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always about men.&rdquo; Madam Maggie rolled her eyes, smiling to show her gold front tooth. &ldquo;Ann, darling, are you in love?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Not with whom I&rsquo;m supposed to be in love with.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the lucky young man?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Prince.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ann!&rdquo; Madam Maggie gasped, looking around to make sure no one else could hear this conversation. &ldquo;Are you insane?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think I am! I don&rsquo;t know what to do! Is there a spell to erase my feelings for him? Or is there some kind of reverse love potion?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Darling, calm down!&rdquo; The old witch puckered up her forehead as she pursed her lips to think for a second or two. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid magic cannot help you with this, at least not without consequences. But how do you know the prince? His father is a terrible man&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing like his father! It&rsquo;s a long story, but I&rsquo;m&mdash;&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>Without waiting for her to finish, Madam Maggie took her right hand and started observing her palm. Ann knew what she was doing, in fact, it was something Ann was capable of doing as well, telling someone&rsquo;s past, future, and present through their palm lines. The only downside to this was that you couldn&rsquo;t read your own palm, someone else had to do it for you.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to help us by staying at Court!&rdquo; Madam Maggie widened her eyes at the girl in shock and terror. &ldquo;Ann, you&rsquo;ve got to leave as soon as possible!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why? W-What did you see?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Terrible things are going to happen if you stay for too long.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I need to wait until the King&rsquo;s made up his mind.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of life and death here Ann!&rdquo; That sentence put the young witch to silence immediately.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Life and death?&rdquo; She asked, unable to believe it was true. &ldquo;Whose?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yours.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>For a second, Ann felt her entire body stiffen. Her face turned a shade lighter and her mouth fell open.&nbsp;</i><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to die?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Different courses of actions can lead to different results, so I&rsquo;m not sure, I just don&rsquo;t think you should risk putting your own life in danger.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s dying, it&rsquo;s the risk I have to take!&rdquo; Ann insisted, still the older witch didn&rsquo;t agree.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You cannot help anyone if something bad happen to you, darling. Leave the King&rsquo;s Court, and go home.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Ann looked down, frightened and at the same time downhearted. She couldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;decide which one was worse: going home empty-handed, or never seeing Edward again, either way it would be too painful to bear.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br /></p><p>The meeting finished shortly because Harry couldn&rsquo;t seem to concentrate.&nbsp;They all agreed to meet up again the next morning to continue the discussions. Jeff was slightly mad, he didn&rsquo;t say it but everyone could tell. They assumed the reason for Harry&rsquo;s distraction was Lillie, his girlfriend, who had been caught cheating but they&rsquo;d got back together at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it wasn&rsquo;t Lillie, well, not entirely her, it was Y/N as well. It might sound weird to say his assistant had anything to do with him not being able to focus. Harry couldn&rsquo;t explain it himself, he just knew from the first moment he&rsquo;d met her, he couldn&rsquo;t shake her off his mind. Maybe it was the fact that after their first day spent together, she refused to talk to him about anything else besides business, and he loved talking to her much more than he could admit.</p><p>As the rest of Harry&rsquo;s team went out for lunch, he was left alone with Y/N. They were going to a fitting next for him to try on his new suits for a movie premiere, which he&rsquo;d be attending tomorrow night.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Y/N,&rdquo; Harry spoke nervously as he tapped slightly on her shoulder. The girl turned around and stared at him with round eyes. &ldquo;Would you like to go to the studio with me later?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do, sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your boss, I decide what task I want you to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N snorted, raising an eyebrow at the man in front of her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that tone on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; Harry shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut for a second. He didn&rsquo;t know where that demanding tone of his came from. He&rsquo;d never been like that before, maybe he was just upset because she was acting so coldly towards him. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t write, I need someone to talk to I guess, makes me feel more at ease.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your girlfriend? Maybe she&rsquo;ll be happy to help,&rdquo; she reminded him. Even though she&rsquo;d tried to not sound too bitter about it, she thought she might&rsquo;ve failed somehow.</p><p>&ldquo;Lillie&rsquo;s busy today, the entire day. I&rsquo;m not even allowed to call her.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t say anything, just nodding her head, the thing she normally did when she was tired of hearing something and she just wanted it to be over.</p><p>&ldquo;This is about me getting back together with her is it? You&rsquo;re not talking to me because of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am talking to you, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not like this, I mean&hellip;<i>really</i> talk,&rdquo; he explained then rolled his own eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making sense but, I miss the conversations we had the day we first met, it&rsquo;s only been about work since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, you want me to talk to you like a friend?&rdquo; She asked, holding the folders to her chest with both arms. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, your assistant would say you&rsquo;re so clever because she doesn&rsquo;t want to lose her job, in the role of your friend, I&rsquo;m saying that you&rsquo;re an idiot,&rdquo; she told him straightforward. &ldquo;You got back together with a cheater. There are plenty of nice people around you Harry. You went around spreading the slogan <i>&lsquo;Treat people with kindness&rsquo; </i>then ended up dating someone who treated you like you didn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lillie loves me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does she? Or is it only you that love her?&rdquo; She shut him right up. He could only stare. &ldquo;Do you even love her, Harry? Are you just staying because you think you have to or what?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry actually stopped to think. She waited patiently as he did. Having only known this man for a month, Y/N cared about him way too much, more than she should. She really wanted him to be happy, and ever since he&rsquo;d got back together with Lillie he&rsquo;d been stressed. That was when you know the relationship was no longer valid.</p><p>Finally, Harry began,&nbsp;&ldquo;you have no idea how hard it is to find someone who&rsquo;s willing to stay with you for two long years despite everything. Lillie has sacrificed a lot to be with me. She told me her friend kissed her without her consent and I believed that. You should understand more than anyone because that&rsquo;s what happened with your best friend right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what? Maybe I prefer you as just my assistant.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry turned as soon as he finished that sentence and then stormed away, leaving her speechless. Little did she know, he regretted saying that immediately.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Edward!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ann, how are you?&rdquo; Edward&rsquo;s eyes brightened the moment he saw Ann. She looked beautiful today, even more than yesterday, if it was possible. He hoped he wasn&rsquo;t showing how infatuated he was with her, but he was already smiling too wide to keep it hidden.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Have you spoken to your father?&rdquo; She asked, looking very worried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a month, more people are dying of hunger, and not to mention more witches are being burnt. You&rsquo;ve got to do something.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still convincing him. I&rsquo;m trying my best Ann,&rdquo; he said, looking straight into her eyes. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry, until he approves of abolishing the witch hunts, you&rsquo;re safe here at Court.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Ann shifted her eyes to her feet and Harry&rsquo;s heart fell with them.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He asked, eyebrows pulled together as he laid a hand gently on her shoulder. &ldquo;Why are you so upset?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t have my answer from the King by morning, I&rsquo;m leaving tomorrow night, to go home. I don&rsquo;t feel safe here, your mother hates me, Princess Emili&eacute; hates me, and your father&hellip;he looks at me like I&rsquo;m a prey. Just&hellip;let me go home, at least I feel safer there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You have me here, I&rsquo;ll keep you safe, love.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Ann took a step forward, taking his right hand in hers and brought it to her chest. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be King one day, you have more important things to care about.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nothing is as important as you,&rdquo; he told her softly, cupping her cheek with his other hand. There were no one around so he could just kiss her without worrying about her reputation or his own. However, he wouldn&rsquo;t do that, not until she wanted to.</i></p><p><i>Ann was taken aback by those words. She wanted to raise a question whether or not he felt the same as she did, but it didn&rsquo;t matter as she was going to leave.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is there another reason?&rdquo; He asked after a moment of silence. She couldn&rsquo;t look at him in the eyes, so that made him feel alarmed.&nbsp;</i><i>Ann wanted to tell him the truth, but even herself wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is it me?&rdquo; Ironically, his question was the answer she was looking for. Yes. It was him. He was the reason she couldn&rsquo;t stay.&nbsp;</i><i>&ldquo;Ann, please tell me&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting married to a princess,&rdquo; was all she said before running off, ignoring him desperately calling after her.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Whether he loved her, or he loved her not, they would never, </i>ever<i>, belong together.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br /></p><p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t write.</p><p>It had happened before but this time it seemed worse. It was getting late and he was lying on the floor in his home studio, a pencil in his mouth, holding a notebook above his face. He had been staring at the blank page for an hour now, still&hellip;<i>nothing</i>. Maybe he was stressed, or maybe he wasn&rsquo;t inspired enough. It was a song about love, and he was in a relationship. It shouldn&rsquo;t have been difficult to write about love when you were <i>in love</i>!</p><p>The knock on the door caused Harry to sit up straight. He told the person to come in and Y/N opened the door, leaning her shoulder against the wooden frame as she stared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you on the floor?&rdquo; She asked, raising an eyebrow but he just gave her a shrug and said nothing at all. &ldquo;I brought you the Gucci suit for the movie premiere, left it in your bedroom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N pressed her lips together and told him she would see him tomorrow morning before turning around. Before Harry could even think twice about what he was going to say, he opened his mouth and the words escaped all on their own.</p><p>&ldquo;Please stay.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N was left speechless. She turned back, eyebrows knitted together, lips slightly parted but she didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean&hellip;stay here and talk to me for a while. I&rsquo;m under a lot of stress and I don&rsquo;t think my mind&rsquo;s working anymore,&rdquo; Harry sighed heavily while holding his head in his hand. &ldquo;I need to get to the chorus before tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can help,&rdquo; she responded softly and slowly, but the look on her face told him she was weighing her options.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo; He hissed, looking up to lock eyes with her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about what I said. I really don&rsquo;t want to be alone now. I&rsquo;m gonna go insane.&rdquo;</p><p>She was quiet for a couple seconds, which seemed like hours to Harry. Finally, she nodded her head, making him sigh in relief.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; the assistant said with a small smile as she closed the door behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not a request from your boss, you don&rsquo;t have to if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he told her out of guilt when she joined him on the floor. It was very demanding of him to ask her to stay here this late at night. She could just quit for this reason.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here as your friend.&rdquo; She giggled, watching dimples appear on his cheeks. She might not notice, but it was the first time that day Harry genuinely smiled.</p><p>An hour passed by.</p><p>Then two hours.</p><p>Then three.</p><p>Then four&hellip;</p><p>The two had been so lost in the conversations to realize how fast time flew. Harry had only known this girl for a month, yet he felt he had for much longer than that. He&rsquo;d told her a lot of things and she wasn&rsquo;t afraid to confide in him either. It was indeed a magical night, in the quiet room lit up by the moonlight, two lonely souls healed each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that your mum?&rdquo; Harry broke the silence when he saw her lockscreen when her phone lit up in the dark.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. I lost her when I was fourteen, never got to know my dad.&rdquo; She laughed sadly staring at the phone though the screen had turned black and all she could see was her own reflection.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I never should&rsquo;ve brought her up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, I love talking about her, she&rsquo;s taught me so much in life.&rdquo; Y/N lifted her shoulders slightly and gave him a small smile. &ldquo;She put so much trust in me. I just want to make her proud.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah right, she must be so proud of how lost and clueless her daughter is in life.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes and exhaled a sarcastic laugh and expected him to react the same way. However, Harry&rsquo;s face remained serious.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re lost and clueless. You have a passion for painting, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;As long as you have something you&rsquo;re passionate about, you&rsquo;re doing fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wise words from Mr. Harry Styles!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She was beaming at him. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence sank in for a little while, they were just staring at everywhere else in the room but each other. Until Harry couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, he had to be the first to speak, &ldquo;can I ask you a very personal question?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure. What is it?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Have you been in love?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Harry, what is it? Don&rsquo;t just stare at me like that!&rdquo; Y/N snorted and Harry only smiled awkwardly. He had no idea where that question had come from. All he knew was that he was curious, or he was probably just searching for confirmation to be sure if her idea of being in love was the same as his, though honestly, now he wasn&rsquo;t so sure if he had an idea.&nbsp;</p><p>He almost let it slip. Thank God he stopped himself just in time, for Harry knew such question would be too invasive, and she was still his employee despite him not seeing her as one.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel about going to a movie premiere?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been to one so how do I know?! And it&rsquo;s not even a personal question, Harry!&rdquo; She tossed her head back and laughed, but then she was quick to notice the look on his face and realized what he was truly implying.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, are you serious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! I want you to go with Jeff and I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I&rsquo;m not a celebrity! There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fun!&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have nothing to wear!&rdquo; <i>That&rsquo;s a very good reason</i>, she thought to herself. The face of Gucci would not take someone so underdressed to a red carpet event with him, and she was sure the most expensive item in her closet was cheaper than the cheapest one in his.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to worry about that if you say yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if I say going to a movie premiere with me is part of your job?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re overusing your powers!&rdquo; Y/N scoffed as she picked up a wrinkled ball of paper and tossed it at him playfully.</p><p>&ldquo;You left me no choice but to bring out boss Harry!&rdquo; He defended himself, raising both hands in the air, cracking her up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo; She pointed a finger at him and squinted her eyes. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s a maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great! I&rsquo;ll have your dress ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unbelievable!&rdquo; She rolled her eyes though there was no way she could hide the joy written on all over her face. He had made her day a thousand times better.</p><p>When the first ray of sunlight sneaked into the room through the gap between the window curtains, Harry and Y/N were still sitting on the floor with their backs against the wall. Harry had finished the first verse and chorus of his new song, and Y/N was still asleep, with her head on his shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure he had got the work done before the deadline, which was worth to celebrate. Nevertheless, Harry didn&rsquo;t know what to feel, when the song which was supposed to be about the love of his life, wasn&rsquo;t inspired by his girlfriend of two years.</p><p>He carefully moved his head to the side and looked at his sleeping assistant who was subconsciously smiling in her sleep. Then he started to wonder, what would happen if she find out he&rsquo;d written a song about her.</p></p>",

Her eyebrows were pinched together as she shifted to be more comfortable in the velvet armchair. &ldquo;I walked to the closest door, which led me to a long corridor. Standing at the other end was a shadow of a man. He was just standing there, like a statue, so I called for his help and started running to get to him, but no matter how hard I tried I always stayed in the same spot. Then suddenly, I fell down into a big black hole&hellip;just keep falling&hellip;falling&hellip;until I see them again&hellip;two flames in a pair of green eyes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;&rdquo; her best friend Jason finally spoke to break the silence she left for him. &ldquo;And then you woke up?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;My dreams, they always ended that way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you sure those are the eyes in the King&rsquo;s portrait?&rdquo; Jason questioned and she could see the obvious doubt in his facial expression.

This organization is present during times of crisis in the most afflicted areas of the planet and is constantly searching for new solutions to alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable populations with a particular focus on children.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it is estimated that 821 million people worldwide suffer from chronic undernutrition. Furthermore, it is estimated that half of all child\u2019s deaths worldwide is due to malnutrition.\u00a0The first two years of the life of a child are particularly important when it comes to nutrition. A child that receives\u00a0the proper nutrition in their first 1000 days of life, has a stronger immune system, can fight off diseases more easily, and has a more complete and harmonious intellectual development.</p>\n<p>Action Against Hunger believes that health problems and death due to undernutrition are <em>predictable</em>,<em> preventable</em>, and <em>treatable</em>. Nelson Mandela, the recipient of the Action Against Hunger 2004 Humanitarian Prize said about this organization:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cAction Against Hunger is in war-torn countries that many fear to tread. They are technical people\u2026 that forgo the comforts of modern life to assist local populations and refugees at the most fundamental level in the most dangerous locales. They provide nutrition, healthcare, sanitation, and food sustainability. They train populations to be self-sufficient. Although these dedicated men and women want to eliminate the need for their services, humanity is not willing and forces them to witness the most heinous actions.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUEBf9-oxcs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Action Against Hunger\u2019s approach to combat undernutrition is multifaced. The organization focuses on four main types of interventions:</p>\n<p>Nutrition and health: they provide assistance not only to save children and families from death and health issues associated with malnourishment but they also work with communities on sustainable\u00a0solutions so that they can support themselves. The organization has over 35 years of experience in dealing with malnutrition in the most affected areas of the\u00a0planet from isolated rural communities to overcrowded urban slums to\u00a0refugee camps. In order to identify sustainable solutions, the organization researches the causes of malnutrition within every single community by gathering and analyzing data. In situations of crisis, they focus primarily on children and pregnant women by distributing nutritional supplements and by training women on how to best provide essential nutrients to their children up to the age of two. Action Against Hunger has also organized a peer to peer training system in which women teach other women how to best support the nutrition and health of their children.</p>\n<p>Water, sanitation, and hygiene: the problem of malnutrition cannot be effectively tackled without tackling the problem of unsafe water. It is estimated that over 2 billion\u00a0people worldwide drink unsafe water, resulting in diarrhea, dysentery, and cholera. In children, these diseases can often lead to death. Action Against Hunger distributes safe water to communities in times of crises and works to find sustainable solutions within each community by drilling and decontaminating wells, installing pumps, protecting natural springs, and piping water into villages. Also, in this case, the emphasis remains on the solutions being sustainable over time and for this reason Action Against Hunger trains local groups and individuals in operating and maintaining the sources of safe water. The organization also distributes hygiene kits, installs latrines, and trains communities on the basic practices of hygiene.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"840\" data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":110670713,\"permalink\":false,\"likes_blog_id\":110670713}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\"> <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 840px;

This organization is present during times of crisis in the most afflicted areas of the planet and is constantly searching for new solutions to alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable populations with a particular focus on children.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it is estimated that 821 million people worldwide suffer from chronic undernutrition. Furthermore, it is estimated that half of all child\u2019s deaths worldwide is due to malnutrition.\u00a0The first two years of the life of a child are particularly important when it comes to nutrition. A child that receives\u00a0the proper nutrition in their first 1000 days of life, has a stronger immune system, can fight off diseases more easily, and has a more complete and harmonious intellectual development.</p>\n<p>Action Against Hunger believes that health problems and death due to undernutrition are <em>predictable</em>,<em> preventable</em>, and <em>treatable</em>. Nelson Mandela, the recipient of the Action Against Hunger 2004 Humanitarian Prize said about this organization:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cAction Against Hunger is in war-torn countries that many fear to tread. They are technical people\u2026 that forgo the comforts of modern life to assist local populations and refugees at the most fundamental level in the most dangerous locales. They provide nutrition, healthcare, sanitation, and food sustainability. They train populations to be self-sufficient. Although these dedicated men and women want to eliminate the need for their services, humanity is not willing and forces them to witness the most heinous actions.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUEBf9-oxcs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Action Against Hunger\u2019s approach to combat undernutrition is multifaced. The organization focuses on four main types of interventions:</p>\n<p>Nutrition and health: they provide assistance not only to save children and families from death and health issues associated with malnourishment but they also work with communities on sustainable\u00a0solutions so that they can support themselves. The organization has over 35 years of experience in dealing with malnutrition in the most affected areas of the\u00a0planet from isolated rural communities to overcrowded urban slums to\u00a0refugee camps. In order to identify sustainable solutions, the organization researches the causes of malnutrition within every single community by gathering and analyzing data. In situations of crisis, they focus primarily on children and pregnant women by distributing nutritional supplements and by training women on how to best provide essential nutrients to their children up to the age of two. Action Against Hunger has also organized a peer to peer training system in which women teach other women how to best support the nutrition and health of their children.</p>\n<p>Water, sanitation, and hygiene: the problem of malnutrition cannot be effectively tackled without tackling the problem of unsafe water. It is estimated that over 2 billion\u00a0people worldwide drink unsafe water, resulting in diarrhea, dysentery, and cholera. In children, these diseases can often lead to death. Action Against Hunger distributes safe water to communities in times of crises and works to find sustainable solutions within each community by drilling and decontaminating wells, installing pumps, protecting natural springs, and piping water into villages. Also, in this case, the emphasis remains on the solutions being sustainable over time and for this reason Action Against Hunger trains local groups and individuals in operating and maintaining the sources of safe water. The organization also distributes hygiene kits, installs latrines, and trains communities on the basic practices of hygiene.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"840\" data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":110670713,\"permalink\":false,\"likes_blog_id\":110670713}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\"> <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 840px;

Harry never really healed, but\nhe did do what Anna asked of him, and found someone who loved him just like she\ndid.
