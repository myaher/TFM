He had his eyes closed and leaned against the cold wall. A thin blanket covered his body, but he was clearly shivering and his teeth clattered. </p><p>\u201cTheon?\u201d Sansa kneeled down in front of him and placed a hand on his arm. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d She whispered, but her voice was firm and steady. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you inside like the others?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed open, but he bent his head and avoided her glance. Sansa wasn\u2019t sure if his lips trembled because of the cold or because of his nervousness. </p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you suffered enough?\u201d She cocked her head and swallowed, but when Theon finally looked up at her she saw nothing but regret, pain and guilt in his glance.</p><p>Slowly he shook his head. \u201cNever.\u201d His voice was shaky. \u201cI can never undo what I did.\u201d He looked over her shoulder at Winterfell, at the open door leading to the warm castle. \u201cThis was my home and I betrayed it. I betrayed Robb. I betrayed you and Rickon and Bran and Arya.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded. \u201cYes, you did.\u201d She licked her dry lips and when a shiver rolled down her spine she tightened her cloak. \u201cBut you paid a high price for that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She didn\u2019t know the details. She had never asked and Theon had never spoken about them. But she knew parts of his story, and those parts were enough to make her sick already.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve to sleep there.\u201d Theon shook his head firmly when he pointed at the castle. \u201cRobb never came home. I shouldn\u2019t have come home either, not without him. I should have been with him when he died.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI lost every right to live here when I took the castle by force.\u201d</p><p>Sansa let out a deep sigh and she stretched out her hand to touch his hairy cheek. \u201cYou helped me escape Ramsay. You brought me back to Jon. You made mistakes, but you also did your very best to make up for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Theon shook his head once more. \u201cI ran away when they captured my sister.

        "body": "<p><b><br/></b>This week, I tweeted a \u2018Bold prediction\u2019 that tbh wasn\u2019t much of a bold prediction. The basic premise was the Starks come out on top. The tweet read like this:<br/><i>Bold prediction that I will at some point write a tumblr meta about. Bran gets the NK, Arya kills Daenerys, Sansa takes out Tyrion, and Jon valonqars the sh*t out of Cersei. Just like that all their enemies are gone. #Starks4theWin #Starklings</i><br/></p><p><b>Bran v\u2019s Night King</b></p><p>This is the point I am the least sure about. But in the end, I do think Bran will play a pivotal role in taking out the Night King and the White Walkers. Jon will come in with the huge assist along with Arya. I fully expect them to have some big kills.</p><p><b>Arya v\u2019s Daenerys</b></p><p>A few other people in the fandom have mentioned this or talked about it. Arya has long been about killing Cersei, the Queen. Except for last season when Lannister soldiers asked her where she was going she said \u2018To kill the Queen.\u2019 A great twist to this would be that she eventually kills or plays a huge role in taking out Daenerys. She may come to a place where her skills are better used to protect her family. <br/>I could also see Daenerys being substituted in for Drogon in this case. I would love an Eowyn like moment where Arya takes off whatever face she is wearing and slays the beast. The show even gave us misdirects with the recent Arya staring in awe at dragons footage.\u00a0</p><p><b>Sansa v\u2019s Tyrion</b></p><p>This is the point I am most confident about. Sansa really needs to get Tyrion out of the way if she wants to live her life. The show made a bit of a mess of this. However, in the books, she is still very much married to Tyrion. She very much didn\u2019t want to be married to him and still doesn\u2019t. A higher authority could give her an annulment. Except for Jon just made the lovely decision to pledge to Daenerys. And Daenerys would have no interest in annulling a marriage between Tyrion and Sansa. What would better tie the North and the Westerlands to her cause then maintaining this marriage. See when Jon gave up his crown (sorta&hellip;he never actually got down on his knee\u2026) he gave up his authority in the North outside of commanding the armies. Sansa has the real power in Winterfell, now. The check on that. The check on Northern independence is Tyrion re-asserting their marriage. So yea Sansa really has to get out of it. This whole scenario may not play out in the show, we may get hints of it instead. Since the show has to end the same as the books, Sansa still has to take out Tyrion, the reasoning just might shift a bit.</p><p>**Also, I fully believe Tyrion is the real \u2018giant\u2019 Sansa slays in the castle made of snow. Again in the show, she may do it somewhere else. Tyrion is the only character referred to as a giant among men etc. etc. Littlefinger is a red herring for this prophecy imo.</p><p><b>Jon v\u2019s Cersei</b></p><p>As I said in my tweet, I believe Jon will valonqar the shit out of Cersei.

            "comment": "<p><b><br></b>This week, I tweeted a \u2018Bold prediction\u2019 that tbh wasn\u2019t much of a bold prediction. The basic premise was the Starks come out on top. The tweet read like this:<br><i>Bold prediction that I will at some point write a tumblr meta about. Bran gets the NK, Arya kills Daenerys, Sansa takes out Tyrion, and Jon valonqars the sh*t out of Cersei. Just like that all their enemies are gone. #Starks4theWin #Starklings</i><br></p><p><b>Bran v\u2019s Night King</b></p><p>This is the point I am the least sure about. But in the end, I do think Bran will play a pivotal role in taking out the Night King and the White Walkers. Jon will come in with the huge assist along with Arya. I fully expect them to have some big kills.</p><p><b>Arya v\u2019s Daenerys</b></p><p>A few other people in the fandom have mentioned this or talked about it. Arya has long been about killing Cersei, the Queen. Except for last season when Lannister soldiers asked her where she was going she said \u2018To kill the Queen.\u2019 A great twist to this would be that she eventually kills or plays a huge role in taking out Daenerys. She may come to a place where her skills are better used to protect her family. <br>I could also see Daenerys being substituted in for Drogon in this case. I would love an Eowyn like moment where Arya takes off whatever face she is wearing and slays the beast. The show even gave us misdirects with the recent Arya staring in awe at dragons footage.\u00a0</p><p><b>Sansa v\u2019s Tyrion</b></p><p>This is the point I am most confident about. Sansa really needs to get Tyrion out of the way if she wants to live her life. The show made a bit of a mess of this. However, in the books, she is still very much married to Tyrion. She very much didn\u2019t want to be married to him and still doesn\u2019t. A higher authority could give her an annulment. Except for Jon just made the lovely decision to pledge to Daenerys. And Daenerys would have no interest in annulling a marriage between Tyrion and Sansa. What would better tie the North and the Westerlands to her cause then maintaining this marriage. See when Jon gave up his crown (sorta\u2026he never actually got down on his knee\u2026) he gave up his authority in the North outside of commanding the armies. Sansa has the real power in Winterfell, now. The check on that. The check on Northern independence is Tyrion re-asserting their marriage. So yea Sansa really has to get out of it. This whole scenario may not play out in the show, we may get hints of it instead. Since the show has to end the same as the books, Sansa still has to take out Tyrion, the reasoning just might shift a bit.</p><p>**Also, I fully believe Tyrion is the real \u2018giant\u2019 Sansa slays in the castle made of snow. Again in the show, she may do it somewhere else. Tyrion is the only character referred to as a giant among men etc. etc. Littlefinger is a red herring for this prophecy imo.</p><p><b>Jon v\u2019s Cersei</b></p><p>As I said in my tweet, I believe Jon will valonqar the shit out of Cersei. I\u2019ve written about this is <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/182427278385/could-jon-really-marry-cersei-in-season-8\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/169096688840/the-younger-more-beautiful-queen-the-valonqar\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/174930749380/tinfoil-and-crack-whos-the-valonqar\">here</a>.
