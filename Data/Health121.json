She\u2019s a wiggly source of energetic joy in our lives every day and we tried our best to make her feel extra loved on her special day!</p>\n<p>But let\u2019s back up a bit to recap the weekend in chronological order!</p>\n<h4>Friday</h4>\n<p>Is it just me or does it seem like everyone in the world is watching \u201cTidying Up with Marie Kondo\u201d on Netflix and cleaning and organizing their homes? I read <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U3vbLs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a>, Marie Kondo\u2019s hugely popular book years ago, and watched one episode of the Netflix show (is she not just the most delightful person!?) and while I wasn\u2019t inspired to go on a tremendous cleaning spree in our house, I did spend a little time on Friday night going through my clothes. I used her <em>\u201cDoes this spark joy?\u201d</em> mentality to figure out which clothes to get rid of which I admittedly found very helpful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84832\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Simply asking myself whether a particular piece of clothing sparks joy and makes me happy somehow allows me to get rid of clothing I\u2019ve had in my closet for years without as much struggle as when I just go through my clothes with a passing glance. I ended up with a small pile of\u00a0 clothing to donate and hope to go through the boys\u2019 clothes soon, too.</p>\n<p>Aside from a bit of cleaning, our Friday night was a good one! I made homemade mac and cheese for dinner and we had a dance party with Chase after Ryder went to bed that cracked us up. Chase was all about showing us his \u201cpittie move\u201d which was basically him jumping and dancing around in circles scratching his armpits. Life with a three-year-old is never dull, that\u2019s for sure.</p>\n<h4>Saturday</h4>\n<p>Saturday morning Ryan and I were both up a little after 5 a.m. when Ryder\u2019s <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U5Vd0f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Owlet sock</a> went off (thankfully not the red notification, but the yellow one notifying a lack of signal reading) and neither of our minds would shut off after that so we headed downstairs. I read way too late into the night again (I finished <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U3STXU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Educated</a> by Tara Westover and would highly recommend it!), so I kicked off the day with a much-needed cup of coffee and my devotional before I spent some time meal planning.</p>\n<p>Once the boy were up, we decided to spend the morning at Latta Plantation for a nature walk despite the dreary weather. We wanted to do something outside so Sadie could join us and even though it was cold and drizzly, the tree coverage at the nature preserve kept us dry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84844 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"405\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\"/></a></p>\n<p>We brought Chase\u2019s bug net and magnifying glass along on the walk and he was in heaven.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84839 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" height=\"554\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84838 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I wore Ryder facing out in the ErgoBaby and we joked that he was pretending to hike along with us because he kept swinging his legs and seemed to be loving every second.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84846\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-990x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"488\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-990x1024.jpg 990w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-290x300.jpg 290w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-768x794.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I hope our boys grow up loving the outdoors and nature as much as they seem to right now!</p>\n<p>It took us a little more than an hour to cover 1.25 miles (Ryan wore his Fitbit) so we weren\u2019t hiking at warp speed but we took our time and stopped a bunch to look at things like twisty sticks, big rocks, mud puddles and more. Saturday morning served as a wonderful reminder that kids don\u2019t need much other than the outdoors to have a ball!</p>\n<p>Before heading home, we swung by Chase\u2019s best friend\u2019s house so he could play with Claire for a bit while we chatted with our friends Lauren and Tony before it was time for lunch.</p>\n<p>We let Chase skip his nap on Saturday (we usually at least encourage him to have quiet time in his room) and he was awfully excited for a rainy day afternoon movie with Mom and Dad while Ryder was napping. We watched Madagascar and I totally forgot how funny that movie is even for adults! Ryder took an extra long nap on Saturday and by the time he was up, we came up with a game plan to knock out our grocery shopping for the week and pick up pizza and cupcakes for dinner on the way home.</p>\n<p>I stayed in the car with Ryder while Ryan and Chase popped into SweetCakes and grabbed an assortment of cupcakes and let\u2019s just say we were all in a sugar coma by the end of the night.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84830\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Yum!</p>\n<h4>Sunday</h4>\n<p>Sunday morning began with extra love and hugs for the birthday girl! Ryan thought Sadie would love kicking her birthday off with a morning walk but our former Florida girl was not havin\u2019 the cold temperatures and super-breezy gusts of wind. Instead we all eased into the day in our pajamas and played at home until it was time for church. We made it back home around 11 a.m., just in time for and early lunch where Ryder tried a combination of green beans, peas and apples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84831\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712-1024x788.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712-1024x788.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712-300x231.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712-768x591.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\"/></a></p>\n<p>It\u2019s honestly blowing my mind to see how excited Ryder is about food! It\u2019s just such a stark contrast to our experience feeding Chase as a baby (and even now because play is still 1,000 times more important to him than eating) but it\u2019s been so fun to watch Ryder grab at the spoon and get all wiggly and enthusiastic when he knows food is coming his way. Please oh please let this last!</p>\n<p>Ryder and Chase\u2019s naps didn\u2019t line up at all on Sunday so we spent the rest of our weekend close to home with the kids and Sadie. In the late afternoon, right after I settled Ryder in his crib for his afternoon nap, Ryan managed to get Sadie out on a walk with Chase and they packed up Chase\u2019s Instax camera and photo album to take pictures on their walk to show me when they arrived home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84834\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725-727x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725-727x1024.jpg 727w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725-213x300.jpg 213w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725-768x1082.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725.jpg 1136w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I used the quiet time I had at home while Ryder slept to prep some food for the week ahead and also got a jump start on this blog post before everyone was back home and it was time for Sadie\u2019s annual birthday food challenge!</p>\n<p>This year we decided to pit last year\u2019s food challenge winner \u2014 breakfast sausage \u2014 against one of Sadie\u2019s favorites: Chicken thighs! We make a lot of chicken thighs in our house and when Sadie is lucky enough to get a few bites of them from time to time she seems to go crazy for them so we figured it would be an interesting match up.</p>\n<p>As always, we let her sniff the two plates of food before Ryan stood back with her and then released her to see which meat she\u2019d go for first.</p>\n<p>And the winner of Sadie\u2019s birthday challenge this year is\u2026</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84836\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767-687x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"406\" height=\"605\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767-687x1024.jpg 687w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767-201x300.jpg 201w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767-768x1145.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Chicken thighs!</p>\n<p>Ryan and I were both shocked, to be honest! We thought sausage would win by a landslide but she was all about the chicken thighs. Maybe she could tell they were fresh off the grill!?</p>\n<p>After Sadie\u2019s birthday challenge, we all dug into chicken thighs and roasted sweet potatoes for dinner before calling it an early night. I started reading <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2TYf2Xo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One Day in December</a> on Saturday evening and am enjoying it so far. I was looking for a light and breezy read and it seems to fit the bill!</p>\n<p>As far as plans for the week ahead, it will be a busy one with the kids because Chase doesn\u2019t have school today or tomorrow. We have a play date on the agenda today and I\u2019m hoping to make it to Burn Boot Camp and get some work done if the boys\u2019 naps coordinate as well! I hope you all have a great Monday!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/sadies-birthday-weekend/\">Sadie\u2019s Birthday Weekend</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com\">Peanut Butter Fingers</a>.</p><br/><br/>\nfrom Health &amp; Wellness <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/sadies-birthday-weekend/\">https://www.pbfingers.com/sadies-birthday-weekend/</a><br/>\nvia <a href=\"http://www.rssmix.com/\">http://www.rssmix.com/</a>",

I read way too late into the night again (I finished <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U3STXU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Educated</a> by Tara Westover and would highly recommend it!), so I kicked off the day with a much-needed cup of coffee and my devotional before I spent some time meal planning.</p>\n<p>Once the boy were up, we decided to spend the morning at Latta Plantation for a nature walk despite the dreary weather. We wanted to do something outside so Sadie could join us and even though it was cold and drizzly, the tree coverage at the nature preserve kept us dry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84844 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"405\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\"></a></p>\n<p>We brought Chase\u2019s bug net and magnifying glass along on the walk and he was in heaven.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84839 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" height=\"554\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84838 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\"></a></p>\n<p>I wore Ryder facing out in the ErgoBaby and we joked that he was pretending to hike along with us because he kept swinging his legs and seemed to be loving every second.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84846\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-990x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"488\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-990x1024.jpg 990w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-290x300.jpg 290w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-768x794.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\"></a></p>\n<p>I hope our boys grow up loving the outdoors and nature as much as they seem to right now!</p>\n<p>It took us a little more than an hour to cover 1.25 miles (Ryan wore his Fitbit) so we weren\u2019t hiking at warp speed but we took our time and stopped a bunch to look at things like twisty sticks, big rocks, mud puddles and more. Saturday morning served as a wonderful reminder that kids don\u2019t need much other than the outdoors to have a ball!</p>\n<p>Before heading home, we swung by Chase\u2019s best friend\u2019s house so he could play with Claire for a bit while we chatted with our friends Lauren and Tony before it was time for lunch.</p>\n<p>We let Chase skip his nap on Saturday (we usually at least encourage him to have quiet time in his room) and he was awfully excited for a rainy day afternoon movie with Mom and Dad while Ryder was napping. We watched Madagascar and I totally forgot how funny that movie is even for adults! Ryder took an extra long nap on Saturday and by the time he was up, we came up with a game plan to knock out our grocery shopping for the week and pick up pizza and cupcakes for dinner on the way home.</p>\n<p>I stayed in the car with Ryder while Ryan and Chase popped into SweetCakes and grabbed an assortment of cupcakes and let\u2019s just say we were all in a sugar coma by the end of the night.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84830\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3691.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\"></a></p>\n<p>Yum!</p>\n<h4>Sunday</h4>\n<p>Sunday morning began with extra love and hugs for the birthday girl! Ryan thought Sadie would love kicking her birthday off with a morning walk but our former Florida girl was not havin\u2019 the cold temperatures and super-breezy gusts of wind. Instead we all eased into the day in our pajamas and played at home until it was time for church. We made it back home around 11 a.m., just in time for and early lunch where Ryder tried a combination of green beans, peas and apples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84831\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712-1024x788.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712-1024x788.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712-300x231.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712-768x591.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3712.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\"></a></p>\n<p>It\u2019s honestly blowing my mind to see how excited Ryder is about food! It\u2019s just such a stark contrast to our experience feeding Chase as a baby (and even now because play is still 1,000 times more important to him than eating) but it\u2019s been so fun to watch Ryder grab at the spoon and get all wiggly and enthusiastic when he knows food is coming his way. Please oh please let this last!</p>\n<p>Ryder and Chase\u2019s naps didn\u2019t line up at all on Sunday so we spent the rest of our weekend close to home with the kids and Sadie. In the late afternoon, right after I settled Ryder in his crib for his afternoon nap, Ryan managed to get Sadie out on a walk with Chase and they packed up Chase\u2019s Instax camera and photo album to take pictures on their walk to show me when they arrived home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84834\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725-727x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725-727x1024.jpg 727w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725-213x300.jpg 213w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725-768x1082.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3725.jpg 1136w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\"></a></p>\n<p>I used the quiet time I had at home while Ryder slept to prep some food for the week ahead and also got a jump start on this blog post before everyone was back home and it was time for Sadie\u2019s annual birthday food challenge!</p>\n<p>This year we decided to pit last year\u2019s food challenge winner \u2014 breakfast sausage \u2014 against one of Sadie\u2019s favorites: Chicken thighs! We make a lot of chicken thighs in our house and when Sadie is lucky enough to get a few bites of them from time to time she seems to go crazy for them so we figured it would be an interesting match up.</p>\n<p>As always, we let her sniff the two plates of food before Ryan stood back with her and then released her to see which meat she\u2019d go for first.</p>\n<p>And the winner of Sadie\u2019s birthday challenge this year is\u2026</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84836\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767-687x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"406\" height=\"605\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767-687x1024.jpg 687w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767-201x300.jpg 201w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767-768x1145.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3767.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\"></a></p>\n<p>Chicken thighs!</p>\n<p>Ryan and I were both shocked, to be honest! We thought sausage would win by a landslide but she was all about the chicken thighs. Maybe she could tell they were fresh off the grill!?</p>\n<p>After Sadie\u2019s birthday challenge, we all dug into chicken thighs and roasted sweet potatoes for dinner before calling it an early night. I started reading <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2TYf2Xo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One Day in December</a> on Saturday evening and am enjoying it so far. I was looking for a light and breezy read and it seems to fit the bill!</p>\n<p>As far as plans for the week ahead, it will be a busy one with the kids because Chase doesn\u2019t have school today or tomorrow. We have a play date on the agenda today and I\u2019m hoping to make it to Burn Boot Camp and get some work done if the boys\u2019 naps coordinate as well!

I read <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U3vbLs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a>, Marie Kondo\u2019s hugely popular book years ago, and watched one episode of the Netflix show (is she not just the most delightful person!?) and while I wasn\u2019t inspired to go on a tremendous cleaning spree in our house, I did spend a little time on Friday night going through my clothes. I used her <em>\u201cDoes this spark joy?\u201d</em> mentality to figure out which clothes to get rid of which I admittedly found very helpful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84832\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\"></a></p>\n<p>Simply asking myself whether a particular piece of clothing sparks joy and makes me happy somehow allows me to get rid of clothing I\u2019ve had in my closet for years without as much struggle as when I just go through my clothes with a passing glance. I ended up with a small pile of\u00a0 clothing to donate and hope to go through the boys\u2019 clothes soon, too.</p>\n<p>Aside from a bit of cleaning, our Friday night was a good one! I made homemade mac and cheese for dinner and we had a dance party with Chase after Ryder went to bed that cracked us up. Chase was all about showing us his \u201cpittie move\u201d which was basically him jumping and dancing around in circles scratching his armpits. Life with a three-year-old is never dull, that\u2019s for sure.</p>\n<h4>Saturday</h4>\n<p>Saturday morning Ryan and I were both up a little after 5 a.m. when Ryder\u2019s <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U5Vd0f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Owlet sock</a> went off (thankfully not the red notification, but the yellow one notifying a lack of signal reading) and neither of our minds would shut off after that so we headed downstairs. I read way too late into the night again (I finished <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U3STXU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Educated</a> by Tara Westover and would highly recommend it!), so I kicked off the day with a much-needed cup of coffee and my devotional before I spent some time meal planning.</p>\n<p>Once the boy were up, we decided to spend the morning at Latta Plantation for a nature walk despite the dreary weather. We wanted to do something outside so Sadie could join us and even though it was cold and drizzly, the tree coverage at the nature preserve kept us dry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84844 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"405\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7849-e1548030939926-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\"></a></p>\n<p>We brought Chase\u2019s bug net and magnifying glass along on the walk and he was in heaven.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84839 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" height=\"554\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7842-e1548030649212-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84838 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_7868-e1548030989719-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\"></a></p>\n<p>I wore Ryder facing out in the ErgoBaby and we joked that he was pretending to hike along with us because he kept swinging his legs and seemed to be loving every second.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84846\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-990x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"488\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-990x1024.jpg 990w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-290x300.jpg 290w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facetune_20-01-2019-19-18-14-768x794.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\"></a></p>\n<p>I hope our boys grow up loving the outdoors and nature as much as they seem to right now!</p>\n<p>It took us a little more than an hour to cover 1.25 miles (Ryan wore his Fitbit) so we weren\u2019t hiking at warp speed but we took our time and stopped a bunch to look at things like twisty sticks, big rocks, mud puddles and more.

She&rsquo;s a wiggly source of energetic joy in our lives every day and we tried our best to make her feel extra loved on her special day!</p>\n<p>But let&rsquo;s back up a bit to recap the weekend in chronological order!</p>\n<h4>Friday</h4>\n<p>Is it just me or does it seem like everyone in the world is watching &ldquo;Tidying Up with Marie Kondo&rdquo; on Netflix and cleaning and organizing their homes? I read <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U3vbLs\" target=\"_blank\">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a>, Marie Kondo&rsquo;s hugely popular book years ago, and watched one episode of the Netflix show (is she not just the most delightful person!?) and while I wasn&rsquo;t inspired to go on a tremendous cleaning spree in our house, I did spend a little time on Friday night going through my clothes. I used her <em>&ldquo;Does this spark joy?&rdquo;</em> mentality to figure out which clothes to get rid of which I admittedly found very helpful.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3717-1024x683.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Simply asking myself whether a particular piece of clothing sparks joy and makes me happy somehow allows me to get rid of clothing I&rsquo;ve had in my closet for years without as much struggle as when I just go through my clothes with a passing glance. I ended up with a small pile of&nbsp; clothing to donate and hope to go through the boys&rsquo; clothes soon, too.</p>\n<p>Aside from a bit of cleaning, our Friday night was a good one! I made homemade mac and cheese for dinner and we had a dance party with Chase after Ryder went to bed that cracked us up. Chase was all about showing us his &ldquo;pittie move&rdquo; which was basically him jumping and dancing around in circles scratching his armpits. Life with a three-year-old is never dull, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>\n<h4>Saturday</h4>\n<p>Saturday morning Ryan and I were both up a little after 5 a.m. when Ryder&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U5Vd0f\" target=\"_blank\">Owlet sock</a> went off (thankfully not the red notification, but the yellow one notifying a lack of signal reading) and neither of our minds would shut off after that so we headed downstairs.

Here are the symptoms and what you can do about it</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"https://goodmorningamerica.com\">goodmorningamerica.com</a></i></p><p>In our world of 24-7 communication, demands and pressure, everyone seems to always be run-down or overwhelmed.</p><p>But feelings that go even beyond that, making it hard to do even the simplest of tasks, may be a sign of burnout.</p><p>&ldquo;It means we&rsquo;re over-allocated,&rdquo; Bea Arthur, a <a href=\"http://beaarthurtherapy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">New York City-based licensed therapist,</a> said of how she defines burnout.</p><p>&ldquo;In your mind, and perception is reality, it feels like you can&rsquo;t drop any balls,&rdquo; she said, adding that you can visualize burnout when you think of your life as a pie chart with everything from work to kids and family taking up all the slivers of the pie.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/ways-make-care-happen-year-59998458\" target=\"_blank\">(MORE: 5 ways to make self-care happen in the new year)</a></p><p>Burnout is just a &ldquo;matter of degree&rdquo; difference from the chronic stress that so many people feel, according to Amy Kurtz, <a href=\"https://amykurtz.com/kicking-sick/\" target=\"_blank\">author of the bestselling book &ldquo;Kicking Sick:</a> Your Go-To Guide for Thriving With Chronic Health Conditions.&ldquo;</p><p>\"We&rsquo;re  told to always be performing at an A+ level but we aren&rsquo;t taught, I don&rsquo;t think at all, that you have to put in ways to unplug and have rituals for yourself or you will burnout,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an epidemic happening especially to millennials because the world is getting faster and faster.&rdquo;</p><p>Burnout among millennials was put in the spotlight last month in an <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work\" target=\"_blank\">essay written by BuzzFeed reporter Anne Helen Petersen</a>, who described how she could excel in her job and some parts of her personal life but felt paralyzed in others.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d put something on my weekly to-do list, and it&rsquo;d roll over, one week to the next, haunting me for months,&rdquo; Peterson wrote of what she labeled &ldquo;errand paralysis.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are seemingly high-effort, low-reward tasks, and they paralyze me,&rdquo; she wrote.</p><p><a href=\"https://annshoket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ann Shoket</a>, author of <a href=\"https://annshoket.com/the-big-life/\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;The Big Life,&rdquo;</a> said the millennial women she meets are often fixated on small things that distract from their bigger lives.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/21-minutes-day-transform-happiness-57646237\" target=\"_blank\">(MORE: How to use 21 minutes each day to transform your happiness)</a></p><p>&ldquo;The kind of burnout I&rsquo;m seeing is a fixation on little things making high-achieving, high-performing women with passion projects and side hustles feel overwhelmed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We feel ashamed that we can&rsquo;t keep up. To say that&rsquo;s what embarrasses us, it puts us in a dark corner.&rdquo;</p><p>Other signs of burnout can include insomnia, chronic fatigue, difficulty concentrating, apathy, irritability, anxiety and getting sick more often.</p><p>While burnout is not a medical diagnosis, it can have physical consequences that include everything from respiratory problems to gastrointestinal issues, according to ABC News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton.</p><h3>Are you suffering from burnout?</h3><p>There are four questions you can ask yourself to determine if you are suffering from burnout, explained Ashton.</p><p>Rate yourself on each question using a number one through four, with one being never, two sometimes, three often and four always. Then total your points from all four questions.</p><p><strong>1. How often are you tired and lacking energy to go to work in the morning?</strong></p><p><strong>2. How often do you feel physically drained, like your batteries are dead?</strong></p><p><strong>3. How often is your thinking process sluggish or your concentration impaired?</strong></p><p><strong>4. How often do you feel emotionally detached from co-workers (or customers) and unable to be sensitive to their needs?</strong></p><p><strong>If you scored less than nine, you are not suffering from burnout.</strong></p><p><strong>If you scored between a 10 and 12, you are on the verge of burnout.</strong></p><p><strong>If you scored between a 13 and a 16, you are suffering full-on burnout.</strong></p><h3>How to help burnout</h3><p>It is up to you to make changes in your life in order to prioritize yourself, experts say.</p><p>&ldquo;Be intentional and force yourself to stop if you&rsquo;re living on one of these never-ending rides,&rdquo; Arthur said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to stop for a while or just fix itself, so you have to do it.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur recommends starting by removing the urgency from things in your life that are truly not urgent.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what is urgent in your life, like seeing your family and friends more,&rdquo; said Arthur, who tries not to answer work-related emails and calls past 7 p.m. because she knows, in her work, nothing tragic is going to happen if she answers in the morning.</p><p>She also schedules her vacations three and six months in advance, which lets her know that she can take a pause.</p><p>&ldquo;Even if the work is still there when you get back from vacation, you&rsquo;ll come back better,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Shoket recommends being intentional about the type of self-care you give yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean get a mani[cure] and facial,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about putting yourself first once in a while. Turn off your phone. Leave work at a reasonable hour. Draw boundaries between your life and your work that allow you to succeed in both.&rdquo;</p><p>Accepting that your life can be big and messy is also good way to move forward, noted Shoket.</p><p>\"You have to embrace the mess,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get caught up in the idea that things have to be perfect or there has to be a balance. A big, ambitious hungry life is a messy life.&rdquo;</p><p>Kurtz, <a href=\"https://amykurtz.com/#services\" target=\"_blank\">also a health and wellness coach</a>, works with her clients to &ldquo;flip the script&rdquo; on burnout by establishing personal rituals.</p><p>The rituals Kurtz recommends include everything from practicing meditation to getting exercise, eating a healthy diet, getting proper rest and setting boundaries on your apps and phone.</p><p>She also stresses the importance of saying no.</p><p>&ldquo;If its not a heck yes, its a heck no,&rdquo; Kurtz said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not totally jazzed about doing something, just say no.&rdquo;</p></p>",
