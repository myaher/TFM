A gust of wind blew it back toward her slightly, but it cleared the tree and glistened in the night sky. A movement directly above shifted her gaze: a lantern had become stuck in the branches of the tree. She watched as it pushed through the leaves, but dropped the paper inside on the way out. Andi watched as the paper fluttered down to the grass at her feet. She made a move to grab it, best no one else see that a wish had fallen. </p><p>\tShe opened it up without even thinking, her eyes immediately falling to the words scrawled on the rice paper. </p><p><i>\ti wish tj could be my boyfriend</i></p><p>\tShe closed it immediately and bawled it into her fist. \u201cWhoa.\u201d </p><p>\tBefore she could even process the note, Bex came up behind her. \u201cWhat?\u201d She said.</p><p>\t\u201cThe lanterns!\u201d Andi lied. \u201cWhoa,\u201d she repeated. </p><p>\t\u201cStunning,\u201d Bex responded. </p><p>\tAndi nodded slightly. What did this mean? Was Buffy really playing the field with two guys? \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she said aloud. She looked back down at her hand and longed to look over the words scrawled on it again, but Cyrus and Buffy were walking towards her.</p><p>\t\u201cGreat festival, Andi!\u201d Cyrus said, still smiling up at the lanterns. </p><p>\t\u201cIt really was,\u201d Buffy added. </p><p>\t\u201cYeah. What did you guys end up wishing for?\u201d She asked hesitantly. </p><p>\tBuffy opened her mouth to speak but Cyrus immediately cut her off. \u201cWe can\u2019t say! Otherwise it won\u2019t come true!\u201d </p><p>\tBuffy rolled her eyes and pushed his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was <i>going</i> to say.\u201d Andi nodded, she wasn\u2019t going to get it out of her tonight. Especially not around Cyrus. </p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tAndi finally looked at the wish again after she and Bex had arrived home. She read it over multiple times: no way to misinterpret that. So what was she doing with Walker then? Andi had to admit their relationship was a big surprise to her, she had never seen them interact before and Buffy had never mentioned wanting to get to know him. Maybe that\u2019s why she wanted TJ to like her? To get out of having to be with Walker? It seemed cruel, especially for Buffy. </p><p>\tShe took the wish, folded it up, and stuffed it in the pocket of her jacket hanging on her door. She would ask Buffy about it tomorrow, there was no way she could keep the secret for longer than that. </p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tThe piece of paper felt like a rock in her pocket the whole morning. She constantly grabbed at it throughout the day to make sure it hadn\u2019t fallen out and by the time lunch rolled around, she felt sick with nerves. How was she supposed to bring it up without accusing Buffy of cheating? Of being unfair to Walker? She let out a deep breath and exited the building, heading towards their lunch table outside. </p><p>\tBuffy was sitting alone, at least that made it slightly easier. She greeted Andi with a smile but quickly realised something was off. </p><p>\t\u201cAre you okay?\u201d She asked. Andi sighed and sat down, pushing her lunch to the side. </p><p>\t\u201cI need to talk to you about Walker,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that you\u2019re \u2018dating\u2019 him.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSo you <i>do</i> still have feelings for him,\u201d Buffy mused. </p><p>\t\u201cNot fair to him,\u201d Andi clarified. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I liked Jonah and Walker, you can\u2019t lead them both on.\u201d </p><p>\tBuffy frowned, obviously confused. \u201cI don\u2019t like Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNot my Jonah! Your Jonah, TJ,\u201d she clarified. </p><p>\t\u201cHow, in any universe, is TJ my <i>Jonah</i>?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cBecause you like him and Walker at the same time!\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy coughed out a laugh. \u201cTJ? You\u2019re kidding, right? I don\u2019t like TJ! I can barely tolerate him.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t like TJ?\u201d Andi questioned. She reached into her jacket pocket and pulled out the piece of rice paper, holding it in front of Buffy \u201cSo what is this supposed to mean?\u201d Buffy took the wish from Andi\u2019s hands and read it herself. </p><p>\t\u201cOh my god,\u201d She looked up at Andi and then back down at the note. \u201cThat\u2019s Cyrus\u2019 handwriting,\u201d she whispered to herself. </p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Andi said reflexively, her voice louder than before. \u201cCyrus? Cyrus has a crush on TJ?&ldquo;</p><p>\t A clanging noise rang out behind Andi and Buffy\u2019s eyes went wide, she turned around to see what had happened. Cyrus was standing five feet away from their table, TJ next to him. His hands were now empty and his tray of food was on the ground. He looked down at the mess, looked up at Buffy and Andi, panic in his eyes, and sprinted the opposite direction. </p><p>\tAndi was met with a flood of guilt and worry. What had she done? She looked to Buffy, who was staring at TJ. TJ looked frantic. He spun around to follow Cyrus abandoning the scene and then looked back at the girls, then back where Cyrus had disappeared.</p><p>\t\u201cTJ,\u201d Buffy snapped. TJ looked to her immediately. \u201cGo!\u201d She ordered. TJ hesitated a second and then turned, jogging after Cyrus. </p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t believe I just did that!\u201d Andi whined. \u201cShould I go say something? I feel so bad.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Andi,\u201d Buffy reassured. \u201cI think you did him a favour.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cUh, I guess there\u2019s no harm telling you now. TJ has a crush on Cyrus,\u201d she said. Andi blinked in shock. \u201cI found out a few weeks ago. He told me he wouldn\u2019t tell Cyrus because he\u2019s <i>convinced </i>Cyrus only likes him as a friend.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him?\u201d Andi asked.</p><p>\tBuffy shook her head slowly. \u201cI honestly couldn\u2019t tell if Cyrus <i>did </i>like him. Especially after everything with Jonah, I didn\u2019t want to push him about liking anyone. Besides, TJ refused to let me even mention him around Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s TJ,\u201d Buffy stated, \u201cWho knows?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI still think I need to go apologise to him,\u201d Andi said, standing up from the table. Buffy reached across the table and grabbed Andi\u2019s arm, pulling her back down. </p><p>\t\u201cLet TJ talk to him first. You never know when his fight or flight reflexes will kick in.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAre you sure he went to talk to him?\u201d Andi asked, fidgeting in her seat. \u201cWhat if he just ran away?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have much faith in TJ,\u201d Buffy admitted. \u201cBut what I do know is he is head-over-heels for that boy. Trust me, he\u2019s with him.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll actually talk about it?\u201d Andi asked.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, if you and Jonah could, anyone can.\u201d </p><p>\tAndi frowned. \u201cVery funny.\u201d </p><p>\tBuffy grinned and then stood up. \u201c5th period?\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\tAndi was restless the rest of the school day. She wanted to text Cyrus, but the boy always had his phone off until the final bell. Buffy agreed she should meet him at his locker after final period, and so she did.</p><p>\tHe wasn\u2019t there when she arrived, and she paced back and forth down the hall, weaving in and out of kids departing for the day. What was she going to say? Apologise immediately of course, but what next? What do you say when you accidentally <i>out </i>someone? Andi was pretty sure that was a serious offence in the friend-world. </p><p>\tShe forgot everything she was thinking when Cyrus turned the corner. He wasn\u2019t alone. TJ was there next to him, grinning wildly down at the boy, who was smiling more than he had in months. He was talking adamantly to TJ, hopping up and down in excitement. Cyrus approached his locker and turned his smile to Andi. </p><p>\t\u201cCyrus! TJ\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d \u00a0TJ shot her a look. \u201c\u2014Talking!\u201d She finished. </p><p>\tCyrus looked to TJ and then back at Andi, beaming. \u201cYes, we\u2019re definitely talking,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what the kids are calling it these days, right?\u201d </p><p>\tAndi rolled her eyes and smiled again before remembering her apology. \u201cOh, Cyrus, I\u2019m so sorry I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c\u2014Andi,\u201d Cyrus cut her off, \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t have anything to be sorry about.\u201d He held out his hand and TJ grabbed it, squeezing slightly before letting go. </p><p>\t\u201cBut I,\u201d she looked around and then lowered her voice, \u201c<i>outed you.</i>\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, \u201cbut just to TJ. And that obviously worked out.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI still feel so bad,\u201d Andi admitted. \u201cCan I make it up to you? I\u2019ll cover your baby taters for a month! Milkshakes too?\u201d </p><p>\tCyrus laughed and shook his head. \u201cNo way!\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWait,\u201d TJ interjected, \u201cI kind of like that deal.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cToo bad you didn\u2019t get outed,\u201d Cyrus said.</p><p>\t\u201cI think you literally just outed me to Andi,\u201d TJ commented. </p><p>\t\u201cActually you did that yourself when you grabbed my hand,\u201d Cyrus retorted. </p><p>\t\u201cYou grabbed my hand.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cHm, I don\u2019t think I did.\u201d Cyrus said. </p><p>\t\u201cYou probably still owe me something though,\u201d TJ mused, grinning at Cyrus.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll buy you baby taters?\u201d Cyrus offered. </p><p>\tTJ shook his head. \u201cNah, I want a full on date. Dinner, movie, the whole shabang.\u201d</p><p>\tCyrus raised an eyebrow, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah.\u201d </p><p>\tAndi coughed slightly and broke the gaze between the two boys. \u201cThis is amazing, really. I\u2019m really happy for you guys, but I should probably go.\u201d</p><p>\tTJ\u2019s cheeks had gone slightly red, he had obviously forgotten Andi was standing there. </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry again,\u201d Andi whispered to Cyrus as she left the high school. She was still incredibly sorry, but it was hard not to feel a little proud of what had happened.</p><p><br/></p><p>Thanks so much for reading!

You never know when his fight or flight reflexes will kick in.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAre you sure he went to talk to him?\u201d Andi asked, fidgeting in her seat. \u201cWhat if he just ran away?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have much faith in TJ,\u201d Buffy admitted. \u201cBut what I do know is he is head-over-heels for that boy. Trust me, he\u2019s with him.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll actually talk about it?\u201d Andi asked.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, if you and Jonah could, anyone can.\u201d </p><p>\tAndi frowned. \u201cVery funny.\u201d </p><p>\tBuffy grinned and then stood up. \u201c5th period?\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\tAndi was restless the rest of the school day. She wanted to text Cyrus, but the boy always had his phone off until the final bell. Buffy agreed she should meet him at his locker after final period, and so she did.</p><p>\tHe wasn\u2019t there when she arrived, and she paced back and forth down the hall, weaving in and out of kids departing for the day. What was she going to say? Apologise immediately of course, but what next? What do you say when you accidentally <i>out </i>someone? Andi was pretty sure that was a serious offence in the friend-world. </p><p>\tShe forgot everything she was thinking when Cyrus turned the corner. He wasn\u2019t alone. TJ was there next to him, grinning wildly down at the boy, who was smiling more than he had in months. He was talking adamantly to TJ, hopping up and down in excitement. Cyrus approached his locker and turned his smile to Andi. </p><p>\t\u201cCyrus! TJ\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d \u00a0TJ shot her a look. \u201c\u2014Talking!\u201d She finished. </p><p>\tCyrus looked to TJ and then back at Andi, beaming. \u201cYes, we\u2019re definitely talking,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what the kids are calling it these days, right?\u201d </p><p>\tAndi rolled her eyes and smiled again before remembering her apology. \u201cOh, Cyrus, I\u2019m so sorry I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c\u2014Andi,\u201d Cyrus cut her off, \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t have anything to be sorry about.\u201d He held out his hand and TJ grabbed it, squeezing slightly before letting go. </p><p>\t\u201cBut I,\u201d she looked around and then lowered her voice, \u201c<i>outed you.</i>\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, \u201cbut just to TJ. And that obviously worked out.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI still feel so bad,\u201d Andi admitted. \u201cCan I make it up to you? I\u2019ll cover your baby taters for a month! Milkshakes too?\u201d </p><p>\tCyrus laughed and shook his head. \u201cNo way!\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWait,\u201d TJ interjected, \u201cI kind of like that deal.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cToo bad you didn\u2019t get outed,\u201d Cyrus said.</p><p>\t\u201cI think you literally just outed me to Andi,\u201d TJ commented. </p><p>\t\u201cActually you did that yourself when you grabbed my hand,\u201d Cyrus retorted. </p><p>\t\u201cYou grabbed my hand.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cHm, I don\u2019t think I did.\u201d Cyrus said. </p><p>\t\u201cYou probably still owe me something though,\u201d TJ mused, grinning at Cyrus.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll buy you baby taters?\u201d Cyrus offered. </p><p>\tTJ shook his head. \u201cNah, I want a full on date.

A gust of wind blew it back toward her slightly, but it cleared the tree and glistened in the night sky. A movement directly above shifted her gaze: a lantern had become stuck in the branches of the tree. She watched as it pushed through the leaves, but dropped the paper inside on the way out. Andi watched as the paper fluttered down to the grass at her feet. She made a move to grab it, best no one else see that a wish had fallen. </p><p>\tShe opened it up without even thinking, her eyes immediately falling to the words scrawled on the rice paper. </p><p><i>\ti wish tj could be my boyfriend</i></p><p>\tShe closed it immediately and bawled it into her fist. \u201cWhoa.\u201d </p><p>\tBefore she could even process the note, Bex came up behind her. \u201cWhat?\u201d She said.</p><p>\t\u201cThe lanterns!\u201d Andi lied. \u201cWhoa,\u201d she repeated. </p><p>\t\u201cStunning,\u201d Bex responded. </p><p>\tAndi nodded slightly. What did this mean? Was Buffy really playing the field with two guys? \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she said aloud. She looked back down at her hand and longed to look over the words scrawled on it again, but Cyrus and Buffy were walking towards her.</p><p>\t\u201cGreat festival, Andi!\u201d Cyrus said, still smiling up at the lanterns. </p><p>\t\u201cIt really was,\u201d Buffy added. </p><p>\t\u201cYeah. What did you guys end up wishing for?\u201d She asked hesitantly. </p><p>\tBuffy opened her mouth to speak but Cyrus immediately cut her off. \u201cWe can\u2019t say!

Especially not around Cyrus. </p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tAndi finally looked at the wish again after she and Bex had arrived home. She read it over multiple times: no way to misinterpret that. So what was she doing with Walker then? Andi had to admit their relationship was a big surprise to her, she had never seen them interact before and Buffy had never mentioned wanting to get to know him. Maybe that\u2019s why she wanted TJ to like her? To get out of having to be with Walker? It seemed cruel, especially for Buffy. </p><p>\tShe took the wish, folded it up, and stuffed it in the pocket of her jacket hanging on her door. She would ask Buffy about it tomorrow, there was no way she could keep the secret for longer than that. </p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tThe piece of paper felt like a rock in her pocket the whole morning. She constantly grabbed at it throughout the day to make sure it hadn\u2019t fallen out and by the time lunch rolled around, she felt sick with nerves. How was she supposed to bring it up without accusing Buffy of cheating? Of being unfair to Walker? She let out a deep breath and exited the building, heading towards their lunch table outside. </p><p>\tBuffy was sitting alone, at least that made it slightly easier. She greeted Andi with a smile but quickly realised something was off. </p><p>\t\u201cAre you okay?\u201d She asked. Andi sighed and sat down, pushing her lunch to the side. </p><p>\t\u201cI need to talk to you about Walker,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that you\u2019re \u2018dating\u2019 him.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSo you <i>do</i> still have feelings for him,\u201d Buffy mused. </p><p>\t\u201cNot fair to him,\u201d Andi clarified. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I liked Jonah and Walker, you can\u2019t lead them both on.\u201d </p><p>\tBuffy frowned, obviously confused. \u201cI don\u2019t like Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNot my Jonah! Your Jonah, TJ,\u201d she clarified. </p><p>\t\u201cHow, in any universe, is TJ my <i>Jonah</i>?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cBecause you like him and Walker at the same time!\u201d</p><p>\tBuffy coughed out a laugh. \u201cTJ? You\u2019re kidding, right? I don\u2019t like TJ! I can barely tolerate him.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t like TJ?\u201d Andi questioned. She reached into her jacket pocket and pulled out the piece of rice paper, holding it in front of Buffy \u201cSo what is this supposed to mean?\u201d Buffy took the wish from Andi\u2019s hands and read it herself. </p><p>\t\u201cOh my god,\u201d She looked up at Andi and then back down at the note. \u201cThat\u2019s Cyrus\u2019 handwriting,\u201d she whispered to herself. </p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Andi said reflexively, her voice louder than before. \u201cCyrus? Cyrus has a crush on TJ?\u201c</p><p>\t A clanging noise rang out behind Andi and Buffy\u2019s eyes went wide, she turned around to see what had happened. Cyrus was standing five feet away from their table, TJ next to him. His hands were now empty and his tray of food was on the ground. He looked down at the mess, looked up at Buffy and Andi, panic in his eyes, and sprinted the opposite direction. </p><p>\tAndi was met with a flood of guilt and worry. What had she done? She looked to Buffy, who was staring at TJ. TJ looked frantic. He spun around to follow Cyrus abandoning the scene and then looked back at the girls, then back where Cyrus had disappeared.</p><p>\t\u201cTJ,\u201d Buffy snapped. TJ looked to her immediately. \u201cGo!\u201d She ordered. TJ hesitated a second and then turned, jogging after Cyrus. </p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t believe I just did that!\u201d Andi whined. \u201cShould I go say something? I feel so bad.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Andi,\u201d Buffy reassured. \u201cI think you did him a favour.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cUh, I guess there\u2019s no harm telling you now. TJ has a crush on Cyrus,\u201d she said. Andi blinked in shock. \u201cI found out a few weeks ago. He told me he wouldn\u2019t tell Cyrus because he\u2019s <i>convinced </i>Cyrus only likes him as a friend.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him?\u201d Andi asked.</p><p>\tBuffy shook her head slowly. \u201cI honestly couldn\u2019t tell if Cyrus <i>did </i>like him. Especially after everything with Jonah, I didn\u2019t want to push him about liking anyone. Besides, TJ refused to let me even mention him around Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s TJ,\u201d Buffy stated, \u201cWho knows?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI still think I need to go apologise to him,\u201d Andi said, standing up from the table.

Andi sighed and sat down, pushing her lunch to the side. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I need to talk to you about Walker,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair that you&rsquo;re &lsquo;dating&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;So you <i>do</i> still have feelings for him,&rdquo; Buffy mused. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Not fair to him,&rdquo; Andi clarified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like when I liked Jonah and Walker, you can&rsquo;t lead them both on.&rdquo; </p><p>\tBuffy frowned, obviously confused. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Jonah.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not my Jonah! Your Jonah, TJ,&rdquo; she clarified. </p><p>\t&ldquo;How, in any universe, is TJ my <i>Jonah</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Because you like him and Walker at the same time!&rdquo;</p><p>\tBuffy coughed out a laugh. &ldquo;TJ? You&rsquo;re kidding, right? I don&rsquo;t like TJ! I can barely tolerate him.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;What do you mean you don&rsquo;t like TJ?&rdquo; Andi questioned. She reached into her jacket pocket and pulled out the piece of rice paper, holding it in front of Buffy &ldquo;So what is this supposed to mean?&rdquo; Buffy took the wish from Andi&rsquo;s hands and read it herself. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; She looked up at Andi and then back down at the note. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Cyrus&rsquo; handwriting,&rdquo; she whispered to herself. </p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Andi said reflexively, her voice louder than before. &ldquo;Cyrus? Cyrus has a crush on TJ?&ldquo;</p><p>\t A clanging noise rang out behind Andi and Buffy&rsquo;s eyes went wide, she turned around to see what had happened. Cyrus was standing five feet away from their table, TJ next to him. His hands were now empty and his tray of food was on the ground. He looked down at the mess, looked up at Buffy and Andi, panic in his eyes, and sprinted the opposite direction. </p><p>\tAndi was met with a flood of guilt and worry. What had she done? She looked to Buffy, who was staring at TJ. TJ looked frantic. He spun around to follow Cyrus abandoning the scene and then looked back at the girls, then back where Cyrus had disappeared.</p><p>\t&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; Buffy snapped. TJ looked to her immediately. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; She ordered. TJ hesitated a second and then turned, jogging after Cyrus. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I just did that!&rdquo; Andi whined. &ldquo;Should I go say something? I feel so bad.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Andi,&rdquo; Buffy reassured. &ldquo;I think you did him a favour.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Uh, I guess there&rsquo;s no harm telling you now. TJ has a crush on Cyrus,&rdquo; she said. Andi blinked in shock. &ldquo;I found out a few weeks ago. He told me he wouldn&rsquo;t tell Cyrus because he&rsquo;s <i>convinced </i>Cyrus only likes him as a friend.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell him?&rdquo; Andi asked.</p><p>\tBuffy shook her head slowly. &ldquo;I honestly couldn&rsquo;t tell if Cyrus <i>did </i>like him. Especially after everything with Jonah, I didn&rsquo;t want to push him about liking anyone. Besides, TJ refused to let me even mention him around Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s TJ,&rdquo; Buffy stated, &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;I still think I need to go apologise to him,&rdquo; Andi said, standing up from the table. Buffy reached across the table and grabbed Andi&rsquo;s arm, pulling her back down. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Let TJ talk to him first. You never know when his fight or flight reflexes will kick in.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you sure he went to talk to him?&rdquo; Andi asked, fidgeting in her seat. &ldquo;What if he just ran away?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have much faith in TJ,&rdquo; Buffy admitted. &ldquo;But what I do know is he is head-over-heels for that boy. Trust me, he&rsquo;s with him.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll actually talk about it?&rdquo; Andi asked.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey, if you and Jonah could, anyone can.&rdquo; </p><p>\tAndi frowned. &ldquo;Very funny.&rdquo; </p><p>\tBuffy grinned and then stood up. &ldquo;5th period?&rdquo; </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\tAndi was restless the rest of the school day. She wanted to text Cyrus, but the boy always had his phone off until the final bell. Buffy agreed she should meet him at his locker after final period, and so she did.</p><p>\tHe wasn&rsquo;t there when she arrived, and she paced back and forth down the hall, weaving in and out of kids departing for the day. What was she going to say? Apologise immediately of course, but what next? What do you say when you accidentally <i>out </i>someone? Andi was pretty sure that was a serious offence in the friend-world. </p><p>\tShe forgot everything she was thinking when Cyrus turned the corner. He wasn&rsquo;t alone. TJ was there next to him, grinning wildly down at the boy, who was smiling more than he had in months. He was talking adamantly to TJ, hopping up and down in excitement. Cyrus approached his locker and turned his smile to Andi. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Cyrus! TJ&rdquo; She exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo; &nbsp;TJ shot her a look. &ldquo;&mdash;Talking!&rdquo; She finished. </p><p>\tCyrus looked to TJ and then back at Andi, beaming. &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re definitely talking,&rdquo; Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the kids are calling it these days, right?&rdquo; </p><p>\tAndi rolled her eyes and smiled again before remembering her apology. &ldquo;Oh, Cyrus, I&rsquo;m so sorry I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;&mdash;Andi,&rdquo; Cyrus cut her off, &ldquo;You obviously don&rsquo;t have anything to be sorry about.&rdquo; He held out his hand and TJ grabbed it, squeezing slightly before letting go. </p><p>\t&ldquo;But I,&rdquo; she looked around and then lowered her voice, &ldquo;<i>outed you.</i>&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus shrugged, &ldquo;but just to TJ. And that obviously worked out.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I still feel so bad,&rdquo; Andi admitted. &ldquo;Can I make it up to you? I&rsquo;ll cover your baby taters for a month! Milkshakes too?&rdquo; </p><p>\tCyrus laughed and shook his head. &ldquo;No way!&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; TJ interjected, &ldquo;I kind of like that deal.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Too bad you didn&rsquo;t get outed,&rdquo; Cyrus said.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I think you literally just outed me to Andi,&rdquo; TJ commented. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Actually you did that yourself when you grabbed my hand,&rdquo; Cyrus retorted. </p><p>\t&ldquo;You grabbed my hand.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Hm, I don&rsquo;t think I did.&rdquo; Cyrus said. </p><p>\t&ldquo;You probably still owe me something though,&rdquo; TJ mused, grinning at Cyrus.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you baby taters?&rdquo; Cyrus offered. </p><p>\tTJ shook his head. &ldquo;Nah, I want a full on date. Dinner, movie, the whole shabang.&rdquo;</p><p>\tCyrus raised an eyebrow, &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; </p><p>\tAndi coughed slightly and broke the gaze between the two boys. &ldquo;This is amazing, really. I&rsquo;m really happy for you guys, but I should probably go.&rdquo;</p><p>\tTJ&rsquo;s cheeks had gone slightly red, he had obviously forgotten Andi was standing there. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry again,&rdquo; Andi whispered to Cyrus as she left the high school. She was still incredibly sorry, but it was hard not to feel a little proud of what had happened.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks so much for reading!
