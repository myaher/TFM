        "body": "<h1>What Friends Are For</h1><p>Chapter 5: Yasha</p><p>(Gonna start cross-posting my work on tumblr! :D)</p><p>Caleb\u2019s drunk, and Yasha is awesome (as always)</p><p><br/></p><p>Caleb was into his fourth (fifth? Sixth?) mug of ale, and his mind was buzzing pleasantly. He vaguely remembered most of the others trudging upstairs, Nott stopping to pat him on the cheek and mutter something in his ear that he couldn\u2019t remember now. It probably wasn\u2019t urgent. Nothing seemed urgent right now, anyway; everything seemed soft, and nice, and maybe friendly. Caleb smiled at no one and everyone.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWe should probably be getting to bed now, Caleb.\u201d Yasha\u2019s face came swimming into his field of vision. He smiled wider.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYasha!\u201d Caleb shouted. He winced; too loud. \u201cYasha, I\u2019m drunk, I think,\u201d he whispered.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right about that,\u201d she replied in her quiet voice.</p><p><br/></p><p>Yasha wasn\u2019t drinking anything, Caleb noticed in his addled state. was she staying down here just for him? The thought made him happy for some reason. \u201cYou are very very kind, Yasha. I haven\u2019t ever told you that but you are very good.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThank you, Caleb,\u201d Yasha said with an amused smile.</p><p><br/></p><p>Caleb felt warm. Is this what friendship felt like? He loved his friends so much. \u201cYou are a good friend,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to dance? I\u2019m out of practice but I can waltz.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never danced before,\u201d Yasha said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think I\u2019d be any good at it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Caleb grabbed her hand, suddenly, with both of his own. \u201cYasha,\u201d he said. \u201cYasha. You\u2019re great. You will be so great at dancing.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Yasha laughed, but let Caleb hold her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot more&hellip; tactile when you\u2019re drunk. And talkative.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He beamed at her. Then, something occurred to him, and he pulled his hand away. \u201cWe are friends, right Yasha? I know, I know you said we were but- are we really? I haven\u2019t- had friends in awhile, besides Nott. Is this- is this what it\u2019s like?\u201d Caleb felt the world swaying gently around him, almost like faint hints of memories of his mother when she used to rock him to sleep after a bad dream. </p><p><br/></p><p>Yasha looked at him with such a sad look on her face. Caleb felt anxiety bloom in his chest for the first time since his third mug of ale. \u201cWell, to tell the truth-\u201c </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d came a gruff voice. Caleb turned to see an angry-looking half-orc stumbling towards them. He was followed by several equally pissed off humanoids, ranging from elf to halfling, all staggering drunkenly. \u201cYou. The- the big one. Yeah, you, lady.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Yasha looked at them passively, not saying a word. The half-orc seemed to take that as an invitation to keep going.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou- I know your type, I seen the likes a ya on the border. You\u2019re one a them <i>cricks</i>, comin\u2019 in from Xhorhas.\u201d His voice was slurring, almost indecipherable. \u201cI\u2019ve seen ones like ya, lookin\u2019 almost human, but ya can\u2019t trick us Empire folk.\u201d At this point, he spit right in Yasha\u2019s face, earning a few mutters from nearby patrons of the tavern. Yasha, for her part, didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cGet outta our tavern.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Before Caleb knew what he was doing, he was pushing back his chair and stumbling out of his seat. \u201cHey! <i>Arschloch</i>!\u201d Caleb stood right in front of the half-orc, just now realizing that the stranger was a full head taller than him. For some reason, Caleb\u2018s mind didn\u2019t register that as a problem. \u201cThat is <i>meine Freundin</i> you are speaking to, <i>Arschgesicht</i>, and-\u201c here Caleb had to suppress a hiccup, \u201c-and she is free to drink <i>wherever</i> she likes, so, kindly <i>Verpiss dich, Schei\u00dfkerl!</i>\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Caleb realized two things in the moments immediately after giving this speech. The first was that he had spoken about half of it in Zemnian, which explained the confused look on the half-orc\u2019s face. He realized the second thing as he saw the half-orc\u2019s hand move, revealing an empty glass bottle which rapidly found its way to Caleb\u2019s face, shattering on impact: that he was an idiot.</p><p><br/></p><p>Then the world got a little blurry, fading to black along the edges. He heard the sounds of people fighting, but was too far gone to process what that meant. Soon, the sounds quieted, and he felt his body shift. Then brief pain, then he was staring at a ceiling, head throbbing. Caleb groaned.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAh- sorry, I kind of&hellip; carried you up to my room,\u201d Yasha said. \u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t want to wake up Nott and make her worry.\u201d Caleb realized there was a damp cloth on his forehead. He reached up to push it away, finding that it was stained with blood.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI tried to heal that up as best as I could, but I don\u2019t really have all that much magic. I thought you could just ask Jester in the morning.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Caleb nodded, then winced at the pain that shot through his skull. \u201c<i>Schei\u00dfe</i>&hellip; what happened?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Yasha shrugged. \u201cAfter that guy hit you, they tried to start some shit with me.\u201d She grinned. \u201cNo such luck.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSo, you took them all out?\u201d Caleb asked. He tried not to let the awe creep into his voice.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt was not too hard, and besides&hellip;\u201d she paused, considering. \u201cBesides, I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Caleb snorted. \u201c<i>Ja</i>, well, I made an utter fool of myself back there, if I remember correctly. So I might not have minded much if I had died, it would have saved me the embarrassment I am currently feeling.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Yasha laughed, soft and sweet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you were hoping to accomplish.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI have no idea what was going through my mind,\u201d Caleb replied, smiling. \u201cI am not usually one for heroic gestures. Unless I have been drinking, apparently.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBut&hellip;\u201d Yasha started. \u201cBut it was&hellip; very sweet of you. To do that. I- uh. I haven\u2019t had many friends who would&hellip; stand up for me. So, thank you.\u201d She shifted uncomfortably, twisting her hands together. \u201cI was going to tell you that earlier, that I wasn\u2019t used to having friends, before that half-orc showed up.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Oh. Caleb felt that same warmth from earlier rise in his chest, but this time it wasn\u2019t a result of alcohol. \u201cOh. <i>Ja</i>, I&hellip; ah. I am glad we are friends, Yasha, even though I am not really good at this whole&hellip; \u2018friendship\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Yasha patted his hand awkwardly, a little too hard, but she was trying. \u201cI- yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI am.

I think one was like&hellip; \u2018arsh-gesit?\u2019\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Arschgesicht</i>. Yes, that means fuckface.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Yasha laughed. \u201cI like that! You should teach us some curse words in Zemnian, so we can shout them when we\u2019re fighting as sort of a, you know, psychological blow.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat is a very good idea,\u201d Caleb said, grinning. \u201cDo you remember any other words I said? It is a little fuzzy for me.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cI think you said&hellip; \u2018froy-den?\u2019\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Caleb paused for a moment, his brain switching gears. \u201cI remember that, sort of. I think I called you <i>meine Freundin</i>. It means \u2018my friend.\u2019\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>She furrowed her brow. \u201cSo, if I wanted to tell you that you are my friend, I would say&hellip; you are \u2018mine-a froy-den\u2019?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He laughed. \u201cYour accent is terrible,\u201d he said, \u201cand <i>meine Freundin</i> is the feminine version. For the masculine version, you would say <i>mein Freund.</i>\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c\u2018Mine froind,\u2019\u201d she repeated carefully. \u201cI like the way that sounds. You are <i>mein Freund</i>.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYour pronunciation is getting better!\u201d Caleb said, beaming. He was strangely proud of her, like when Nott sent him her first message using the spell he had taught her. \u201cI will teach you some more Zemnian later, if you want.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI would like that,\u201d she replied, smiling.</p><p><br/></p><p>Caleb sighed contentedly. This&hellip; was nice. He hadn\u2019t had anything this nice in a long time, it felt like. But now he had Yasha, and Nott, and the others&hellip;. he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had smiled this much. Not in years.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI should probably sleep, now, though,\u201d he said finally, pushing himself off the bed and ignoring the slight dizziness the motion caused. Yasha noticed, though, and grabbed him by the arm.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAlright, just don\u2019t pass out on your way over there,\u201d she said, helping him to the door of her room. He gave a small wave as he stumbled into his and Nott\u2019s shared room, careful not to wake her as he collapsed on the bed. There was still a smile on his face as he drifted off to sleep.</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>What Friends Are For</h1><p>Chapter 5: Yasha</p><p>(Gonna start cross-posting my work on tumblr! :D)</p><p>Caleb\u2019s drunk, and Yasha is awesome (as always)</p><p><br></p><p>Caleb was into his fourth (fifth? Sixth?) mug of ale, and his mind was buzzing pleasantly. He vaguely remembered most of the others trudging upstairs, Nott stopping to pat him on the cheek and mutter something in his ear that he couldn\u2019t remember now. It probably wasn\u2019t urgent. Nothing seemed urgent right now, anyway; everything seemed soft, and nice, and maybe friendly. Caleb smiled at no one and everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe should probably be getting to bed now, Caleb.\u201d Yasha\u2019s face came swimming into his field of vision. He smiled wider.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYasha!\u201d Caleb shouted. He winced; too loud. \u201cYasha, I\u2019m drunk, I think,\u201d he whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right about that,\u201d she replied in her quiet voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Yasha wasn\u2019t drinking anything, Caleb noticed in his addled state. was she staying down here just for him? The thought made him happy for some reason. \u201cYou are very very kind, Yasha. I haven\u2019t ever told you that but you are very good.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThank you, Caleb,\u201d Yasha said with an amused smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Caleb felt warm. Is this what friendship felt like? He loved his friends so much. \u201cYou are a good friend,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to dance? I\u2019m out of practice but I can waltz.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never danced before,\u201d Yasha said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think I\u2019d be any good at it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Caleb grabbed her hand, suddenly, with both of his own. \u201cYasha,\u201d he said. \u201cYasha. You\u2019re great. You will be so great at dancing.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Yasha laughed, but let Caleb hold her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot more\u2026 tactile when you\u2019re drunk. And talkative.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He beamed at her. Then, something occurred to him, and he pulled his hand away. \u201cWe are friends, right Yasha? I know, I know you said we were but- are we really? I haven\u2019t- had friends in awhile, besides Nott. Is this- is this what it\u2019s like?\u201d Caleb felt the world swaying gently around him, almost like faint hints of memories of his mother when she used to rock him to sleep after a bad dream. </p><p><br></p><p>Yasha looked at him with such a sad look on her face. Caleb felt anxiety bloom in his chest for the first time since his third mug of ale. \u201cWell, to tell the truth-\u201c </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d came a gruff voice. Caleb turned to see an angry-looking half-orc stumbling towards them. He was followed by several equally pissed off humanoids, ranging from elf to halfling, all staggering drunkenly. \u201cYou. The- the big one. Yeah, you, lady.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Yasha looked at them passively, not saying a word. The half-orc seemed to take that as an invitation to keep going.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou- I know your type, I seen the likes a ya on the border. You\u2019re one a them <i>cricks</i>, comin\u2019 in from Xhorhas.\u201d His voice was slurring, almost indecipherable. \u201cI\u2019ve seen ones like ya, lookin\u2019 almost human, but ya can\u2019t trick us Empire folk.\u201d At this point, he spit right in Yasha\u2019s face, earning a few mutters from nearby patrons of the tavern. Yasha, for her part, didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cGet outta our tavern.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Before Caleb knew what he was doing, he was pushing back his chair and stumbling out of his seat. \u201cHey! <i>Arschloch</i>!\u201d Caleb stood right in front of the half-orc, just now realizing that the stranger was a full head taller than him. For some reason, Caleb\u2018s mind didn\u2019t register that as a problem. \u201cThat is <i>meine Freundin</i> you are speaking to, <i>Arschgesicht</i>, and-\u201c here Caleb had to suppress a hiccup, \u201c-and she is free to drink <i>wherever</i> she likes, so, kindly <i>Verpiss dich, Schei\u00dfkerl!</i>\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Caleb realized two things in the moments immediately after giving this speech. The first was that he had spoken about half of it in Zemnian, which explained the confused look on the half-orc\u2019s face. He realized the second thing as he saw the half-orc\u2019s hand move, revealing an empty glass bottle which rapidly found its way to Caleb\u2019s face, shattering on impact: that he was an idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the world got a little blurry, fading to black along the edges. He heard the sounds of people fighting, but was too far gone to process what that meant. Soon, the sounds quieted, and he felt his body shift. Then brief pain, then he was staring at a ceiling, head throbbing. Caleb groaned.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAh- sorry, I kind of\u2026 carried you up to my room,\u201d Yasha said. \u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t want to wake up Nott and make her worry.\u201d Caleb realized there was a damp cloth on his forehead. He reached up to push it away, finding that it was stained with blood.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI tried to heal that up as best as I could, but I don\u2019t really have all that much magic. I thought you could just ask Jester in the morning.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Caleb nodded, then winced at the pain that shot through his skull. \u201c<i>Schei\u00dfe</i>\u2026 what happened?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Yasha shrugged. \u201cAfter that guy hit you, they tried to start some shit with me.\u201d She grinned. \u201cNo such luck.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo, you took them all out?\u201d Caleb asked. He tried not to let the awe creep into his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt was not too hard, and besides\u2026\u201d she paused, considering. \u201cBesides, I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Caleb snorted. \u201c<i>Ja</i>, well, I made an utter fool of myself back there, if I remember correctly. So I might not have minded much if I had died, it would have saved me the embarrassment I am currently feeling.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Yasha laughed, soft and sweet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you were hoping to accomplish.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI have no idea what was going through my mind,\u201d Caleb replied, smiling. \u201cI am not usually one for heroic gestures. Unless I have been drinking, apparently.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yasha started. \u201cBut it was\u2026 very sweet of you. To do that. I- uh. I haven\u2019t had many friends who would\u2026 stand up for me. So, thank you.\u201d She shifted uncomfortably, twisting her hands together. \u201cI was going to tell you that earlier, that I wasn\u2019t used to having friends, before that half-orc showed up.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Oh. Caleb felt that same warmth from earlier rise in his chest, but this time it wasn\u2019t a result of alcohol. \u201cOh. <i>Ja</i>, I\u2026 ah. I am glad we are friends, Yasha, even though I am not really good at this whole\u2026 \u2018friendship\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Yasha patted his hand awkwardly, a little too hard, but she was trying. \u201cI- yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI am. Um. Me either.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>They sat in companionable, but still awkward, silence for a few moments. Then Yasha cleared her throat.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUh, what were those things you said in Zemnian?

So, thank you.\u201d She shifted uncomfortably, twisting her hands together. \u201cI was going to tell you that earlier, that I wasn\u2019t used to having friends, before that half-orc showed up.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Oh. Caleb felt that same warmth from earlier rise in his chest, but this time it wasn\u2019t a result of alcohol. \u201cOh. <i>Ja</i>, I\u2026 ah. I am glad we are friends, Yasha, even though I am not really good at this whole\u2026 \u2018friendship\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Yasha patted his hand awkwardly, a little too hard, but she was trying. \u201cI- yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI am. Um. Me either.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>They sat in companionable, but still awkward, silence for a few moments. Then Yasha cleared her throat.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUh, what were those things you said in Zemnian? I think one was like\u2026 \u2018arsh-gesit?\u2019\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Arschgesicht</i>. Yes, that means fuckface.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Yasha laughed. \u201cI like that! You should teach us some curse words in Zemnian, so we can shout them when we\u2019re fighting as sort of a, you know, psychological blow.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat is a very good idea,\u201d Caleb said, grinning. \u201cDo you remember any other words I said? It is a little fuzzy for me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cI think you said\u2026 \u2018froy-den?\u2019\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Caleb paused for a moment, his brain switching gears. \u201cI remember that, sort of. I think I called you <i>meine Freundin</i>. It means \u2018my friend.\u2019\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She furrowed her brow. \u201cSo, if I wanted to tell you that you are my friend, I would say\u2026 you are \u2018mine-a froy-den\u2019?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He laughed. \u201cYour accent is terrible,\u201d he said, \u201cand <i>meine Freundin</i> is the feminine version. For the masculine version, you would say <i>mein Freund.</i>\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c\u2018Mine froind,\u2019\u201d she repeated carefully. \u201cI like the way that sounds. You are <i>mein Freund</i>.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYour pronunciation is getting better!\u201d Caleb said, beaming. He was strangely proud of her, like when Nott sent him her first message using the spell he had taught her. \u201cI will teach you some more Zemnian later, if you want.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI would like that,\u201d she replied, smiling.</p><p><br></p><p>Caleb sighed contentedly. This\u2026 was nice. He hadn\u2019t had anything this nice in a long time, it felt like. But now he had Yasha, and Nott, and the others\u2026. he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had smiled this much. Not in years.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI should probably sleep, now, though,\u201d he said finally, pushing himself off the bed and ignoring the slight dizziness the motion caused. Yasha noticed, though, and grabbed him by the arm.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright, just don\u2019t pass out on your way over there,\u201d she said, helping him to the door of her room. He gave a small wave as he stumbled into his and Nott\u2019s shared room, careful not to wake her as he collapsed on the bed. There was still a smile on his face as he drifted off to sleep.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>What Friends Are For</h1><p>Chapter 5: Yasha</p><p>(Gonna start cross-posting my work on tumblr! :D)</p><p>Caleb&rsquo;s drunk, and Yasha is awesome (as always)</p><p><br /></p><p>Caleb was into his fourth (fifth? Sixth?) mug of ale, and his mind was buzzing pleasantly. He vaguely remembered most of the others trudging upstairs, Nott stopping to pat him on the cheek and mutter something in his ear that he couldn&rsquo;t remember now. It probably wasn&rsquo;t urgent. Nothing seemed urgent right now, anyway; everything seemed soft, and nice, and maybe friendly. Caleb smiled at no one and everyone.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;We should probably be getting to bed now, Caleb.&rdquo; Yasha&rsquo;s face came swimming into his field of vision. He smiled wider.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yasha!&rdquo; Caleb shouted. He winced; too loud. &ldquo;Yasha, I&rsquo;m drunk, I think,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right about that,&rdquo; she replied in her quiet voice.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yasha wasn&rsquo;t drinking anything, Caleb noticed in his addled state. was she staying down here just for him? The thought made him happy for some reason. &ldquo;You are very very kind, Yasha. I haven&rsquo;t ever told you that but you are very good.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Caleb,&rdquo; Yasha said with an amused smile.</p><p><br /></p><p>Caleb felt warm. Is this what friendship felt like? He loved his friends so much. &ldquo;You are a good friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you want to dance? I&rsquo;m out of practice but I can waltz.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never danced before,&rdquo; Yasha said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really think I&rsquo;d be any good at it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Caleb grabbed her hand, suddenly, with both of his own. &ldquo;Yasha,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yasha. You&rsquo;re great. You will be so great at dancing.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Yasha laughed, but let Caleb hold her hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lot more&hellip; tactile when you&rsquo;re drunk. And talkative.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>He beamed at her. Then, something occurred to him, and he pulled his hand away. &ldquo;We are friends, right Yasha? I know, I know you said we were but- are we really? I haven&rsquo;t- had friends in awhile, besides Nott. Is this- is this what it&rsquo;s like?&rdquo; Caleb felt the world swaying gently around him, almost like faint hints of memories of his mother when she used to rock him to sleep after a bad dream. </p><p><br /></p><p>Yasha looked at him with such a sad look on her face. Caleb felt anxiety bloom in his chest for the first time since his third mug of ale. &ldquo;Well, to tell the truth-&ldquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you,&rdquo; came a gruff voice. Caleb turned to see an angry-looking half-orc stumbling towards them. He was followed by several equally pissed off humanoids, ranging from elf to halfling, all staggering drunkenly. &ldquo;You. The- the big one. Yeah, you, lady.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Yasha looked at them passively, not saying a word. The half-orc seemed to take that as an invitation to keep going.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You- I know your type, I seen the likes a ya on the border. You&rsquo;re one a them <i>cricks</i>, comin&rsquo; in from Xhorhas.&rdquo; His voice was slurring, almost indecipherable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen ones like ya, lookin&rsquo; almost human, but ya can&rsquo;t trick us Empire folk.&rdquo; At this point, he spit right in Yasha&rsquo;s face, earning a few mutters from nearby patrons of the tavern. Yasha, for her part, didn&rsquo;t flinch. &ldquo;Get outta our tavern.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Before Caleb knew what he was doing, he was pushing back his chair and stumbling out of his seat. &ldquo;Hey! <i>Arschloch</i>!&rdquo; Caleb stood right in front of the half-orc, just now realizing that the stranger was a full head taller than him. For some reason, Caleb&lsquo;s mind didn&rsquo;t register that as a problem. &ldquo;That is <i>meine Freundin</i> you are speaking to, <i>Arschgesicht</i>, and-&ldquo; here Caleb had to suppress a hiccup, &ldquo;-and she is free to drink <i>wherever</i> she likes, so, kindly <i>Verpiss dich, Schei&szlig;kerl!</i>&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Caleb realized two things in the moments immediately after giving this speech. The first was that he had spoken about half of it in Zemnian, which explained the confused look on the half-orc&rsquo;s face. He realized the second thing as he saw the half-orc&rsquo;s hand move, revealing an empty glass bottle which rapidly found its way to Caleb&rsquo;s face, shattering on impact: that he was an idiot.</p><p><br /></p><p>Then the world got a little blurry, fading to black along the edges. He heard the sounds of people fighting, but was too far gone to process what that meant. Soon, the sounds quieted, and he felt his body shift. Then brief pain, then he was staring at a ceiling, head throbbing. Caleb groaned.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ah- sorry, I kind of&hellip; carried you up to my room,&rdquo; Yasha said. &ldquo;I figured you wouldn&rsquo;t want to wake up Nott and make her worry.&rdquo; Caleb realized there was a damp cloth on his forehead. He reached up to push it away, finding that it was stained with blood.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I tried to heal that up as best as I could, but I don&rsquo;t really have all that much magic. I thought you could just ask Jester in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Caleb nodded, then winced at the pain that shot through his skull. &ldquo;<i>Schei&szlig;e</i>&hellip; what happened?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Yasha shrugged. &ldquo;After that guy hit you, they tried to start some shit with me.&rdquo; She grinned. &ldquo;No such luck.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, you took them all out?&rdquo; Caleb asked. He tried not to let the awe creep into his voice.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was not too hard, and besides&hellip;&rdquo; she paused, considering. &ldquo;Besides, I was worried about you.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Caleb snorted. &ldquo;<i>Ja</i>, well, I made an utter fool of myself back there, if I remember correctly. So I might not have minded much if I had died, it would have saved me the embarrassment I am currently feeling.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Yasha laughed, soft and sweet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you were hoping to accomplish.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea what was going through my mind,&rdquo; Caleb replied, smiling. &ldquo;I am not usually one for heroic gestures. Unless I have been drinking, apparently.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Yasha started. &ldquo;But it was&hellip; very sweet of you. To do that. I- uh. I haven&rsquo;t had many friends who would&hellip; stand up for me. So, thank you.&rdquo; She shifted uncomfortably, twisting her hands together. &ldquo;I was going to tell you that earlier, that I wasn&rsquo;t used to having friends, before that half-orc showed up.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Oh.
