I plan on doing it next so get ready lol ;) Have a Happy Halloween and stay safe!\u00a0</p><p><i><b>Update:</b> So apparently tumblr killed links (Idk why, it honestly makes no sense) But if that\u2019s the case I won\u2019t be linking my masterlists anymore until it\u2019s fixed. If any post has a link in it, it won\u2019t appear in the search engine. Obviously others are saying it too but please if you see a fic/content you like the reblog it! It just became much harder for content creators to spread their work and this would help a lot! <b>You can find my Masterlist on my profile and the Whumptober Masterlist under series!</b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><hr><p>Peter gasped the moment his body slammed into the concrete. Metal hands tightly wrapped around his throat. Black spots filled his vision as he tries to squirm out from its grip. He wheezed struggling to find air for his burning lungs.<b><br/></b></p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t breathe, he couldn\u2019t breathe.</i></p><p>His body ached, suit practically torn to shreds as blood spilled out between the tears. Karen was long gone, he couldn\u2019t contact anyone. He was alone pinned against the ground struggling for his life. </p><p>He\u2019s never been so scared, scared of leaving of his loved ones behind. Peter wondered how May would react, she lost too much already. His friends, would they be ok? Ned was his guy in the chair, his best friend, he didn\u2019t need to lose someone. MJ, his girlfriend of eight months. They didn\u2019t even get to celebrate a year together. And what about Tony? His father figure, his friend-</p><p><i>His attacker. </i></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes watered staring up at the man he barely recognized. His mentor\u2019s eyes were lifeless, lacking any emotion. The Tony he knew wouldn\u2019t hurt him but here he was dying at the hands of the person he trusted the most. And it was all his fault.</p><p>_____</p><p>The team was on a mission in Europe, Berlin in fact. This time however they weren\u2019t fighting each other in some airport, they were hunting down a terrorist. Some ugly white dude hell bent on striking fear into people around the world. </p><p>He already hit a few other cities, causing mass chaos. The team was finally called in after the bomber hit Rome causing normal civilians to lash out on one another. Whatever chemicals he started to use struck enough fear in the UN to call the Avengers to assemble. </p><p>The team managed to get a tip from one of Natasha\u2019s old \u201cfriends\u201d that the next target was Berlin and that he was hiding out in some apartment complex. What they didn\u2019t expect was just the amount of bombs that were already placed around the city. </p><p>The team was stretched out across the city leaving Peter alone with Tony to investigate a construction site left empty for the day. </p><p>\u201cEyes up kiddo this guy is known for rigging his bomb sites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Mr. Stark I was there during the mission briefing.\u201d</p><p>Tony scoffed scanning the room. \u201cYou mean when you fell asleep on my shoulder? I know Cap can be pretty extensive with his briefings but I don&rsquo;t think he\u2019s that boring. Don\u2019t tell him I said that last part though, I\u2019ll never live it down.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head thankful his mentor couldn\u2019t see the blush growing on his cheeks. \u201cHe just kept rambling and I don\u2019t know I literally grew up with his PSA\u2019s. So I kinda just have a habit of tuning him out sometimes.\u201dHis mentor laughed loudly as Peter shrugged. \u201cHe has a soothing voice what can I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re something else kid.\u201d</p><p>He shot Tony a wink before silently following behind trying to mindful of his surroundings. From what he heard, a couple of bomb squads set off the bomb early and things went downhill quickly. </p><p>His mentor stopped abruptly signaling Peter to stop. \u201cFRIDAY is detecting a signature matching one of the bombs. Wait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou are not stepping anywhere close to a bomb. Not if I can help it.\u201d Tony pointed at him. \u201cStay put.\u201d</p><p>He huffed watching his mentor slowly creep up to the location of the bomb. From what Peter could see, it was a black box with a few wires sticking out. Definitely looked rushed than the ones he has seen. He watched his mentor open the box gently working on disarming it. </p><p>Peter leaned against the wall trying to get a better look at the action. His sense buzzed, hairs standing up on the back of his neck. His whole body screamed danger. </p><p>\u201cUh, Mr. Stark-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNot now bud, I need to focus.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when his ears picked up the slightest click. He turned his head to the wall he was leaning on. A small thin wire blended into the wall seemingly leaning right towards Tony. Peter heard about click as he shifted his weight. </p><p>He turned, backing away from the watching a green light flash quickly. His blood ran cold, he just set off one of the bomb\u2019s traps. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark-\u201c</p><p>He was too late, the bomb already fired knocking Peter into a newly constructed wall. He fell to the ground with a loud thud heat from the explosions washing over him. Prices of debris fell on him, trapping him against the floor. </p><p>His ear rang as his vision blurred. He definitely had a concussion from a blast like that. That least he was a few feet back. It\u2019s not like he was right next to the bomb-</p><p><i>Tony.</i></p><p>His eyes snapped opened trying to free himself. Clawing his way out, he stumbled coughing on the dust that filled the air. Peter\u2019s suit was a mess, but still mostly intact. He felt fine for the most part. No murderous vibes coming off him. But that didn\u2019t matter, he needed to find Tony.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d He shouted working his way through the debris. \u201cKaren! Call the team and tell them-\u201c He was met by static as he cursed loudly. He was on his own for now. </p><p>Peter was lifting up a piece of concrete when he noticed the broken red and gold nanosuit. Throwing the debris to the side he started digging trying to pull his mentor to safety. </p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d He muttered still digging noticing Tony\u2019s faceplate missing its other half. \u201cPlease be alive, please be alive.\u201d</p><p>Once he could the head freed he started working on Tony\u2019s arms and chest. His mentor head shifted, looking directly at Peter. The suits eyes glowed as Peter\u2019s sense screamed danger. He looked around no noticing harmful it was only him and-</p><p>Peter gasped loudly the moment Tony\u2019s hand grabbed his neck. He jerked away kicking his mentor back as he scrambled onto his feet. This wasn\u2019t good, not at all.</p><p>\u201cTony it\u2019s me,\u201d He said slowly as the suit drug its own way out. Tony\u2019s suit was badly damaged but that didn\u2019t stop him from making his way towards Peter. He aimed his repulsor at him. \u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Peter ran away back towards the spot he came from barely missing the blast. He couldn\u2019t fight Tony, what if he hurt him? His mentor didn\u2019t know what his was doing right now.</p><p>Peter always thought he was a fast runner but what he didn\u2019t think about was the fact that Tony can fly. The next thing he knew, he was being thrown into a wall at high speed. Over and Over again until his world went black. </p><p>____</p><p>When he finally came to, he couldn\u2019t breathe. A strong mental hand rested tightly around his neck. He gasped loudly the moment his body was lifted from the ground and slammed into the concrete.</p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t breathe, he couldn\u2019t breathe.</i></p><p>Black spots filled his vision as he got desperate for air. His lungs were burning, he needed to breathe. With all his might he clenched his fist sending it straight into Tony\u2019s head. </p><p>His mentor\u2019s faceplate broke off as the hand around his neck loosen. He gasped kicking Tony back a few feet. Peter wheezed coughing from the lack of oxygen. He needed to stop his mentor before other got hurt. </p><p>\u201cTony, stop!\u201d He rasped. \u201cPlease! It\u2019s me, Peter!\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lifeless eyes stared back at him, he only had a stern expression that Peter only saw when he\u2019s beating bad guys. His mentor was trying to kill him, he was going to have to fight Tony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d He whispered before charging at the man. </p><p>What followed next was something Peter never thought would happen even. The man he practically worshiped as a kid who later became another father figure to him was trying to beat him to ground. Tony didn\u2019t hold back, he fired his weapons, he shocked Peter, and more importantly, he brought out his sword. </p><p>Only by change was Peter able to break off the sword before getting a few good hits in. He prayed the team would arrive soon, he needed back up. Someone to help detain his mentor. </p><p>Peter stopped punching noticing the blood dripping from Tony\u2019s mouth. He did that, he actually hurt Tony. To shocked at his actions he didn\u2019t seem his mentor\u2019s charming at him. Soon he found himself on the ground in another choke hold. </p><p>He squirmed begging Tony to stop. He wanted Tony back, the same man who ditched a whole day of meetings to cheer him up after a horrible day at school. The man who watched movies with him, tinkered in the lab with, and even built legos with. </p><p>His vision blurred as senses overwhelmed him. He needed to grabbed something, he needed to knock his mentor off him. Peter felt something metal and quickly wrapped his hands around the base. It felt like a pipe, he could use a pipe. </p><p>Sending one last kick to Tony\u2019s he raised the pipe up only to hear a loud gasped as his mentor slumped forward. Peter wheezed breathing heavily as he felt something sticking on his hands. </p><p><i>Blood. It\u2019s was blood. </i></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes fell on the object that he thought was a pipe only to realize that it was the sword he broke off moments ago.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d Tony gagged blood spilling out of his mouth as he fell to the floor.</p><p><i>He just stabbed Tony. He stabbed him.</i></p><p>He screamed in horror rushing to his mentor\u2019s side. Blood pooled out of him into a large puddle on the floor. Peter was crying at his point keeping the pressure on the wound he caused. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die, don\u2019t die.\u201d He begged sobbing. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t move, he only breathed shallow breathes. Peter screamed for someone to help him. This was Uncle Ben all over again. He couldn\u2019t lose Tony, not in this way. </p><p><i>This was all his fault.</i></p><hr><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSAoXn7rDKTQ-SDQxNVGeAg\">@winteriscomingidjits</a> | <a

Metal hands tightly wrapped around his throat. Black spots filled his vision as he tries to squirm out from its grip. He wheezed struggling to find air for his burning lungs.<b><br></b></p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t breathe, he couldn\u2019t breathe.</i></p><p>His body ached, suit practically torn to shreds as blood spilled out between the tears. Karen was long gone, he couldn\u2019t contact anyone. He was alone pinned against the ground struggling for his life. </p><p>He\u2019s never been so scared, scared of leaving of his loved ones behind. Peter wondered how May would react, she lost too much already. His friends, would they be ok? Ned was his guy in the chair, his best friend, he didn\u2019t need to lose someone. MJ, his girlfriend of eight months. They didn\u2019t even get to celebrate a year together. And what about Tony? His father figure, his friend-</p><p><i>His attacker. </i></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes watered staring up at the man he barely recognized. His mentor\u2019s eyes were lifeless, lacking any emotion. The Tony he knew wouldn\u2019t hurt him but here he was dying at the hands of the person he trusted the most. And it was all his fault.</p><p>_____</p><p>The team was on a mission in Europe, Berlin in fact.

He aimed his repulsor at him. \u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Peter ran away back towards the spot he came from barely missing the blast. He couldn\u2019t fight Tony, what if he hurt him? His mentor didn\u2019t know what his was doing right now.</p><p>Peter always thought he was a fast runner but what he didn\u2019t think about was the fact that Tony can fly. The next thing he knew, he was being thrown into a wall at high speed. Over and Over again until his world went black. </p><p>____</p><p>When he finally came to, he couldn\u2019t breathe. A strong mental hand rested tightly around his neck. He gasped loudly the moment his body was lifted from the ground and slammed into the concrete.</p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t breathe, he couldn\u2019t breathe.</i></p><p>Black spots filled his vision as he got desperate for air. His lungs were burning, he needed to breathe. With all his might he clenched his fist sending it straight into Tony\u2019s head. </p><p>His mentor\u2019s faceplate broke off as the hand around his neck loosen. He gasped kicking Tony back a few feet. Peter wheezed coughing from the lack of oxygen. He needed to stop his mentor before other got hurt. </p><p>\u201cTony, stop!\u201d He rasped. \u201cPlease! It\u2019s me, Peter!\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lifeless eyes stared back at him, he only had a stern expression that Peter only saw when he\u2019s beating bad guys. His mentor was trying to kill him, he was going to have to fight Tony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d He whispered before charging at the man. </p><p>What followed next was something Peter never thought would happen even. The man he practically worshiped as a kid who later became another father figure to him was trying to beat him to ground. Tony didn\u2019t hold back, he fired his weapons, he shocked Peter, and more importantly, he brought out his sword. </p><p>Only by change was Peter able to break off the sword before getting a few good hits in. He prayed the team would arrive soon, he needed back up. Someone to help detain his mentor. </p><p>Peter stopped punching noticing the blood dripping from Tony\u2019s mouth. He did that, he actually hurt Tony. To shocked at his actions he didn\u2019t seem his mentor\u2019s charming at him. Soon he found himself on the ground in another choke hold. </p><p>He squirmed begging Tony to stop. He wanted Tony back, the same man who ditched a whole day of meetings to cheer him up after a horrible day at school. The man who watched movies with him, tinkered in the lab with, and even built legos with. </p><p>His vision blurred as senses overwhelmed him. He needed to grabbed something, he needed to knock his mentor off him. Peter felt something metal and quickly wrapped his hands around the base. It felt like a pipe, he could use a pipe. </p><p>Sending one last kick to Tony\u2019s he raised the pipe up only to hear a loud gasped as his mentor slumped forward. Peter wheezed breathing heavily as he felt something sticking on his hands. </p><p><i>Blood. It\u2019s was blood. </i></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes fell on the object that he thought was a pipe only to realize that it was the sword he broke off moments ago.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d Tony gagged blood spilling out of his mouth as he fell to the floor.</p><p><i>He just stabbed Tony. He stabbed him.</i></p><p>He screamed in horror rushing to his mentor\u2019s side. Blood pooled out of him into a large puddle on the floor. Peter was crying at his point keeping the pressure on the wound he caused. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die, don\u2019t die.\u201d He begged sobbing. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t move, he only breathed shallow breathes. Peter screamed for someone to help him. This was Uncle Ben all over again. He couldn\u2019t lose Tony, not in this way. </p><p><i>This was all his fault.</i></p><hr><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSAoXn7rDKTQ-SDQxNVGeAg\">@winteriscomingidjits</a> | <a

Metal hands tightly wrapped around his throat. Black spots filled his vision as he tries to squirm out from its grip. He wheezed struggling to find air for his burning lungs.<b><br></b></p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t breathe, he couldn\u2019t breathe.</i></p><p>His body ached, suit practically torn to shreds as blood spilled out between the tears. Karen was long gone, he couldn\u2019t contact anyone. He was alone pinned against the ground struggling for his life. </p><p>He\u2019s never been so scared, scared of leaving of his loved ones behind. Peter wondered how May would react, she lost too much already. His friends, would they be ok? Ned was his guy in the chair, his best friend, he didn\u2019t need to lose someone. MJ, his girlfriend of eight months. They didn\u2019t even get to celebrate a year together. And what about Tony? His father figure, his friend-</p><p><i>His attacker. </i></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes watered staring up at the man he barely recognized. His mentor\u2019s eyes were lifeless, lacking any emotion. The Tony he knew wouldn\u2019t hurt him but here he was dying at the hands of the person he trusted the most. And it was all his fault.</p><p>_____</p><p>The team was on a mission in Europe, Berlin in fact. This time however they weren\u2019t fighting each other in some airport, they were hunting down a terrorist. Some ugly white dude hell bent on striking fear into people around the world. </p><p>He already hit a few other cities, causing mass chaos. The team was finally called in after the bomber hit Rome causing normal civilians to lash out on one another. Whatever chemicals he started to use struck enough fear in the UN to call the Avengers to assemble. </p><p>The team managed to get a tip from one of Natasha\u2019s old \u201cfriends\u201d that the next target was Berlin and that he was hiding out in some apartment complex. What they didn\u2019t expect was just the amount of bombs that were already placed around the city. </p><p>The team was stretched out across the city leaving Peter alone with Tony to investigate a construction site left empty for the day. </p><p>\u201cEyes up kiddo this guy is known for rigging his bomb sites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Mr. Stark I was there during the mission briefing.\u201d</p><p>Tony scoffed scanning the room. \u201cYou mean when you fell asleep on my shoulder? I know Cap can be pretty extensive with his briefings but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that boring. Don\u2019t tell him I said that last part though, I\u2019ll never live it down.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head thankful his mentor couldn\u2019t see the blush growing on his cheeks. \u201cHe just kept rambling and I don\u2019t know I literally grew up with his PSA\u2019s. So I kinda just have a habit of tuning him out sometimes.\u201dHis mentor laughed loudly as Peter shrugged. \u201cHe has a soothing voice what can I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re something else kid.\u201d</p><p>He shot Tony a wink before silently following behind trying to mindful of his surroundings. From what he heard, a couple of bomb squads set off the bomb early and things went downhill quickly. </p><p>His mentor stopped abruptly signaling Peter to stop. \u201cFRIDAY is detecting a signature matching one of the bombs. Wait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou are not stepping anywhere close to a bomb. Not if I can help it.\u201d Tony pointed at him. \u201cStay put.\u201d</p><p>He huffed watching his mentor slowly creep up to the location of the bomb. From what Peter could see, it was a black box with a few wires sticking out. Definitely looked rushed than the ones he has seen. He watched his mentor open the box gently working on disarming it. </p><p>Peter leaned against the wall trying to get a better look at the action. His sense buzzed, hairs standing up on the back of his neck. His whole body screamed danger. </p><p>\u201cUh, Mr. Stark-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNot now bud, I need to focus.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when his ears picked up the slightest click. He turned his head to the wall he was leaning on. A small thin wire blended into the wall seemingly leaning right towards Tony. Peter heard about click as he shifted his weight. </p><p>He turned, backing away from the watching a green light flash quickly. His blood ran cold, he just set off one of the bomb\u2019s traps. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark-\u201c</p><p>He was too late, the bomb already fired knocking Peter into a newly constructed wall. He fell to the ground with a loud thud heat from the explosions washing over him. Prices of debris fell on him, trapping him against the floor. </p><p>His ear rang as his vision blurred. He definitely had a concussion from a blast like that. That least he was a few feet back. It\u2019s not like he was right next to the bomb-</p><p><i>Tony.</i></p><p>His eyes snapped opened trying to free himself. Clawing his way out, he stumbled coughing on the dust that filled the air. Peter\u2019s suit was a mess, but still mostly intact. He felt fine for the most part. No murderous vibes coming off him. But that didn\u2019t matter, he needed to find Tony.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d He shouted working his way through the debris. \u201cKaren! Call the team and tell them-\u201c He was met by static as he cursed loudly. He was on his own for now. </p><p>Peter was lifting up a piece of concrete when he noticed the broken red and gold nanosuit. Throwing the debris to the side he started digging trying to pull his mentor to safety. </p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d He muttered still digging noticing Tony\u2019s faceplate missing its other half. \u201cPlease be alive, please be alive.\u201d</p><p>Once he could the head freed he started working on Tony\u2019s arms and chest. His mentor head shifted, looking directly at Peter. The suits eyes glowed as Peter\u2019s sense screamed danger. He looked around no noticing harmful it was only him and-</p><p>Peter gasped loudly the moment Tony\u2019s hand grabbed his neck. He jerked away kicking his mentor back as he scrambled onto his feet. This wasn\u2019t good, not at all.</p><p>\u201cTony it\u2019s me,\u201d He said slowly as the suit drug its own way out. Tony\u2019s suit was badly damaged but that didn\u2019t stop him from making his way towards Peter.

Metal hands tightly wrapped around his throat. Black spots filled his vision as he tries to squirm out from its grip. He wheezed struggling to find air for his burning lungs.<b><br /></b></p><p><i>He couldn&rsquo;t breathe, he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</i></p><p>His body ached, suit practically torn to shreds as blood spilled out between the tears. Karen was long gone, he couldn&rsquo;t contact anyone. He was alone pinned against the ground struggling for his life. </p><p>He&rsquo;s never been so scared, scared of leaving of his loved ones behind. Peter wondered how May would react, she lost too much already. His friends, would they be ok? Ned was his guy in the chair, his best friend, he didn&rsquo;t need to lose someone. MJ, his girlfriend of eight months. They didn&rsquo;t even get to celebrate a year together. And what about Tony? His father figure, his friend-</p><p><i>His attacker. </i></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes watered staring up at the man he barely recognized. His mentor&rsquo;s eyes were lifeless, lacking any emotion. The Tony he knew wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him but here he was dying at the hands of the person he trusted the most. And it was all his fault.</p><p>_____</p><p>The team was on a mission in Europe, Berlin in fact. This time however they weren&rsquo;t fighting each other in some airport, they were hunting down a terrorist. Some ugly white dude hell bent on striking fear into people around the world. </p><p>He already hit a few other cities, causing mass chaos. The team was finally called in after the bomber hit Rome causing normal civilians to lash out on one another. Whatever chemicals he started to use struck enough fear in the UN to call the Avengers to assemble. </p><p>The team managed to get a tip from one of Natasha&rsquo;s old &ldquo;friends&rdquo; that the next target was Berlin and that he was hiding out in some apartment complex. What they didn&rsquo;t expect was just the amount of bombs that were already placed around the city. </p><p>The team was stretched out across the city leaving Peter alone with Tony to investigate a construction site left empty for the day. </p><p>&ldquo;Eyes up kiddo this guy is known for rigging his bomb sites.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know Mr. Stark I was there during the mission briefing.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony scoffed scanning the room. &ldquo;You mean when you fell asleep on my shoulder? I know Cap can be pretty extensive with his briefings but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s that boring. Don&rsquo;t tell him I said that last part though, I&rsquo;ll never live it down.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head thankful his mentor couldn&rsquo;t see the blush growing on his cheeks. &ldquo;He just kept rambling and I don&rsquo;t know I literally grew up with his PSA&rsquo;s. So I kinda just have a habit of tuning him out sometimes.&rdquo;His mentor laughed loudly as Peter shrugged. &ldquo;He has a soothing voice what can I say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re something else kid.&rdquo;</p><p>He shot Tony a wink before silently following behind trying to mindful of his surroundings. From what he heard, a couple of bomb squads set off the bomb early and things went downhill quickly. </p><p>His mentor stopped abruptly signaling Peter to stop. &ldquo;FRIDAY is detecting a signature matching one of the bombs. Wait here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are not stepping anywhere close to a bomb. Not if I can help it.&rdquo; Tony pointed at him. &ldquo;Stay put.&rdquo;</p><p>He huffed watching his mentor slowly creep up to the location of the bomb. From what Peter could see, it was a black box with a few wires sticking out. Definitely looked rushed than the ones he has seen. He watched his mentor open the box gently working on disarming it. </p><p>Peter leaned against the wall trying to get a better look at the action. His sense buzzed, hairs standing up on the back of his neck. His whole body screamed danger. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, Mr. Stark-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not now bud, I need to focus.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s when his ears picked up the slightest click. He turned his head to the wall he was leaning on. A small thin wire blended into the wall seemingly leaning right towards Tony. Peter heard about click as he shifted his weight. </p><p>He turned, backing away from the watching a green light flash quickly. His blood ran cold, he just set off one of the bomb&rsquo;s traps. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark-&ldquo;</p><p>He was too late, the bomb already fired knocking Peter into a newly constructed wall. He fell to the ground with a loud thud heat from the explosions washing over him. Prices of debris fell on him, trapping him against the floor. </p><p>His ear rang as his vision blurred. He definitely had a concussion from a blast like that. That least he was a few feet back. It&rsquo;s not like he was right next to the bomb-</p><p><i>Tony.</i></p><p>His eyes snapped opened trying to free himself. Clawing his way out, he stumbled coughing on the dust that filled the air. Peter&rsquo;s suit was a mess, but still mostly intact. He felt fine for the most part. No murderous vibes coming off him. But that didn&rsquo;t matter, he needed to find Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; He shouted working his way through the debris. &ldquo;Karen! Call the team and tell them-&ldquo; He was met by static as he cursed loudly. He was on his own for now. </p><p>Peter was lifting up a piece of concrete when he noticed the broken red and gold nanosuit. Throwing the debris to the side he started digging trying to pull his mentor to safety. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh God,&rdquo; He muttered still digging noticing Tony&rsquo;s faceplate missing its other half. &ldquo;Please be alive, please be alive.&rdquo;</p><p>Once he could the head freed he started working on Tony&rsquo;s arms and chest. His mentor head shifted, looking directly at Peter. The suits eyes glowed as Peter&rsquo;s sense screamed danger. He looked around no noticing harmful it was only him and-</p><p>Peter gasped loudly the moment Tony&rsquo;s hand grabbed his neck. He jerked away kicking his mentor back as he scrambled onto his feet. This wasn&rsquo;t good, not at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; He said slowly as the suit drug its own way out. Tony&rsquo;s suit was badly damaged but that didn&rsquo;t stop him from making his way towards Peter. He aimed his repulsor at him. &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter ran away back towards the spot he came from barely missing the blast. He couldn&rsquo;t fight Tony, what if he hurt him? His mentor didn&rsquo;t know what his was doing right now.</p><p>Peter always thought he was a fast runner but what he didn&rsquo;t think about was the fact that Tony can fly. The next thing he knew, he was being thrown into a wall at high speed. Over and Over again until his world went black. </p><p>____</p><p>When he finally came to, he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. A strong mental hand rested tightly around his neck. He gasped loudly the moment his body was lifted from the ground and slammed into the concrete.</p><p><i>He couldn&rsquo;t breathe, he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</i></p><p>Black spots filled his vision as he got desperate for air. His lungs were burning, he needed to breathe. With all his might he clenched his fist sending it straight into Tony&rsquo;s head. </p><p>His mentor&rsquo;s faceplate broke off as the hand around his neck loosen. He gasped kicking Tony back a few feet. Peter wheezed coughing from the lack of oxygen. He needed to stop his mentor before other got hurt. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony, stop!&rdquo; He rasped. &ldquo;Please! It&rsquo;s me, Peter!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s lifeless eyes stared back at him, he only had a stern expression that Peter only saw when he&rsquo;s beating bad guys. His mentor was trying to kill him, he was going to have to fight Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; He whispered before charging at the man. </p><p>What followed next was something Peter never thought would happen even. The man he practically worshiped as a kid who later became another father figure to him was trying to beat him to ground. Tony didn&rsquo;t hold back, he fired his weapons, he shocked Peter, and more importantly, he brought out his sword. </p><p>Only by change was Peter able to break off the sword before getting a few good hits in. He prayed the team would arrive soon, he needed back up. Someone to help detain his mentor. </p><p>Peter stopped punching noticing the blood dripping from Tony&rsquo;s mouth. He did that, he actually hurt Tony. To shocked at his actions he didn&rsquo;t seem his mentor&rsquo;s charming at him. Soon he found himself on the ground in another choke hold. </p><p>He squirmed begging Tony to stop. He wanted Tony back, the same man who ditched a whole day of meetings to cheer him up after a horrible day at school. The man who watched movies with him, tinkered in the lab with, and even built legos with. </p><p>His vision blurred as senses overwhelmed him. He needed to grabbed something, he needed to knock his mentor off him. Peter felt something metal and quickly wrapped his hands around the base. It felt like a pipe, he could use a pipe. </p><p>Sending one last kick to Tony&rsquo;s he raised the pipe up only to hear a loud gasped as his mentor slumped forward. Peter wheezed breathing heavily as he felt something sticking on his hands. </p><p><i>Blood. It&rsquo;s was blood. </i></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes fell on the object that he thought was a pipe only to realize that it was the sword he broke off moments ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; Tony gagged blood spilling out of his mouth as he fell to the floor.</p><p><i>He just stabbed Tony. He stabbed him.</i></p><p>He screamed in horror rushing to his mentor&rsquo;s side. Blood pooled out of him into a large puddle on the floor. Peter was crying at his point keeping the pressure on the wound he caused. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die, don&rsquo;t die.&rdquo; He begged sobbing. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to, I didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t move, he only breathed shallow breathes. Peter screamed for someone to help him. This was Uncle Ben all over again. He couldn&rsquo;t lose Tony, not in this way. </p><p><i>This was all his fault.</i></p><hr /><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSAoXn7rDKTQ-SDQxNVGeAg\">@winteriscomingidjits</a> |
