I\u2019ve been sitting on this one for a while because I wanted to do it some justice but I\u2019m super proud of it so I hope you are too! </b></i></p><p>Pregnancy always was enchanting to Harry. He\u2019d said it on so many occasions, that you being pregnant, a little swollen belly and glowing skin, your hair full of a whole new bounce and your eyes exceptionally bright, was his absolute favourite thing. Knowing that you were homing his little baby inside until he or she was ready to come out into the world, it was like you were a gift from the Gods.</p><p>Your entire pregnancy he\u2019d barely left your side, attending to your every need and answering your every beck and call. He was like a footman, concierge, bodyguard, chef, barman, spa therapist and waiter all at once, he was just always there. At one point early on he\u2019d started to irritate you with how much fuss he was making over you, but you never mentioned it because you knew it would only cause an argument not worth having, and you knew you\u2019d come out the other side looking extremely ungrateful.</p><p>And then your daughter was born and everything changed.</p><p>Harry had noticed your distance from him. No, not from the baby, from him. You were infatuated with her, barely left her alone to the point that when Harry held her you were jealous. But you seemed to shy away from him at every opportunity, avoiding his touch and affection towards you like you hated him.</p><p>Even with your daughter sleeping between you in bed for the first few months, after she started sleeping in her cot you still slept right on the edge of the bed, as far away from him as possible. The doctors recommended six weeks before having intercourse again, and here Harry was four months later feeling a little heavy down below.</p><p>You\u2019d also started wearing pyjamas in bed, something you\u2019d never done before, not even when you were pregnant. And they weren\u2019t particularly flattering either, not that Harry would ever say anything, he\u2019d just always admired that you used to be comfortable enough around him to sleep naked.</p><p>But the truth was you didn\u2019t hate him, quite the opposite in fact. You just didn\u2019t feel worthy of him anymore, because not only were you no longer pregnant but your body was also no what it used to be. You\u2019d never been particularly thin anyway, but even still you\u2019d never felt less confident in yourself.</p><p>You\u2019d heard a girl call her legs tree trunks once and thought she was ridiculous for putting herself down in such a way, but now you can certainly see where she was coming from when you look down at your own legs. Your stretch marks grew from the curve of your arse all the way down to your mid thighs, and they were even worse on your still bloated stomach, stretching right across your front so that you looked like a fucking weird coloured tiger.</p><p>Yeah, you\u2019d never felt like a match for your husband before, so you certainly didn\u2019t feel like one now.</p><p>A small bubble of noise came from the Moses basket beside your bed, pulling you from your light slumber. In your new conscious state you\u2019re aware of the fact that during the night Harry has edged his way into the middle of the bed and laid a lazy arm over your side, lacing his fingers with yours. It makes you feel guilty.</p><p>You sit up, slipping your hand out of his to fawn over your little girl\u2019s blanket. You\u2019re aware that Harry\u2019s hand has remained glued to your fleshy hip as you start to coo at your baby, his thumb rubbing a soft circle into your buried hip bone, indicating that he\u2019s awake.</p><p>\u201cHi pretty girl.\u201d You whisper quietly to her, beaming down at her as you stroke her cheek while flutters her eyes open and closed, making the most adorable noises you think you\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cDid we have a good sleep? I think we did because it\u2019s nearly nine o\u2019clock and we\u2019ve actually had a lie in.\u201d</p><p>You can feel Harry\u2019s gaze burning a hole in your back while his caresses become more fervent, his hand beginning to stroke up and down your waist under your pyjama top. It makes you nervous as you think of all the imperfections he can feel in your skin, all the little rolls he comes across every time he moves his hand up and then back down again. You decide to stop him, placing your hand on his and gently removing it whilst keeping your eyes on your seemingly happy four month old.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d Harry voice comes from behind you, and even in its deep morning husk you can hear the offence behind it.</p><p>You\u2019re not sure why you decide to play dumb because you know it\u2019s not going to do you any favours. Maybe the early hour is making you stupid. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>You hear a shuffle behind you, a you continue to play ignorant while you gaze at your baby girl, until Harry\u2019s strong arms are around your waist - this time thankfully over your top - and his head is on your shoulder. You can feel his knees lightly digging into your sides, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the hard beating of your heart.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you keep pushing me away? Like you hate me?\u201d He begs, curls brushing against your ear as he bravely kisses the side of your face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d You retort lightly, feeling more guilty that you\u2019ve given that impression. \u201cI could never hate you.\u201d And that much is true. It\u2019s scary really, how much you\u2019d think to stick by him for.</p><p>He frowns, pulling his head back along your shoulder slightly to look at you. But you\u2019re still too busy faffing over the baby who\u2019s began to wriggle wildly. \u201cWhat have I done then? Because I\u2019m so confused, love.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re not entirely sure how to answer. Your hands are too busy trying to carefully pull your infant from her cot without too much fuss, and it temporarily distracts you from his question while you settle her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, this is the longest you\u2019ve consciously let me touch you since the day we brought her home.\u201d He tells you with slight drain to his voice, his eyes glued to yours from the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>That was easy enough. \u201cI have.\u201d You mumble, because you\u2019ve been terrified to say it since your distance started. Your daughter begins wriggling restlessly, her noise still bubbling as she nods her head towards your breast.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you have?\u201d He sounds baffled. No, he\u2019s definitely beyond baffled but he persists. \u201cBecause for me the only thing that\u2019s changed is that we have a baby and you refuse to let me near you.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re sure as hell not going to have this conversation facing away from him with an aching back. You sigh, a breathe filled with strange sadness, and turn your head to finally look at him. For the first time in months you\u2019re the one to kiss him. Because he remains to be the most handsome man you\u2019ve ever seen, and weirdly enough he\u2019s yours and remains to be. \u201cCan I sit properly to feed her first?\u201d</p><p>Harry studies your gaze for a moment before nodding, pecking your lips back and detaching himself from you. He takes your infant from you, something that doesn\u2019t please her much as she begins to cry while you quickly remove your t-shirt and settle a pillow against the headboard. Harry coos at her quietly until you\u2019re holding your arms out for her again, cradling her in your arms and holding her head as she begins to feed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously love, I think this is the first time I think I\u2019ve seen you without a top on for months.\u201d And he does sound serious, there\u2019s not a hint of teasing present in his tone as he crawls to sit right beside you, facing you with his legs bent beside him, leaning on an arm that he\u2019s sat between your half crossed legs.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t feel good about myself anymore, Harry.\u201d You finally admit, giving a light shrug as your expression reads a little helpless. \u201cI feel\u2026 I don\u2019t know, horrible. Big.\u201d</p><p>Big. Without being insulting he tries to think of a way to tell you that you\u2019re being\u2026 well, silly. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had a baby\u2026 I didn\u2019t exactly expect you to just go back to normal, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that I feel bad about myself. Like, I just don\u2019t feel good enough for you.\u201d Your daughter distracts you again as her mouth detaches from your nipple, and you\u2019re quick to move her to your other breast.</p><p>As you do Harry reaches for the little cloth you keep with you, and without any hesitation he wipes the excess milk from your breast. \u201cYou think I care about any of that? Angel, I love you for you. You had a baby for me, I couldn\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re a bit bigger because of it, it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s natural. It certainly doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re my wife and I still adore you in all the ways I did before. It just means I\u2019ve got a few more reasons to love you, and a few more things to love on.\u201d</p><p>You let out a little laugh at his mini rant and watch him for a moment. He looks deadly serious, the smallest little line between his brows that tells you he means it.

I\u2019ve been sitting on this one for a while because I wanted to do it some justice but I\u2019m super proud of it so I hope you are too! </b></i></p><p>Pregnancy always was enchanting to Harry. He\u2019d said it on so many occasions, that you being pregnant, a little swollen belly and glowing skin, your hair full of a whole new bounce and your eyes exceptionally bright, was his absolute favourite thing. Knowing that you were homing his little baby inside until he or she was ready to come out into the world, it was like you were a gift from the Gods.</p><p>Your entire pregnancy he\u2019d barely left your side, attending to your every need and answering your every beck and call. He was like a footman, concierge, bodyguard, chef, barman, spa therapist and waiter all at once, he was just always there. At one point early on he\u2019d started to irritate you with how much fuss he was making over you, but you never mentioned it because you knew it would only cause an argument not worth having, and you knew you\u2019d come out the other side looking extremely ungrateful.</p><p>And then your daughter was born and everything changed.</p><p>Harry had noticed your distance from him. No, not from the baby, from him. You were infatuated with her, barely left her alone to the point that when Harry held her you were jealous. But you seemed to shy away from him at every opportunity, avoiding his touch and affection towards you like you hated him.</p><p>Even with your daughter sleeping between you in bed for the first few months, after she started sleeping in her cot you still slept right on the edge of the bed, as far away from him as possible. The doctors recommended six weeks before having intercourse again, and here Harry was four months later feeling a little heavy down below.</p><p>You\u2019d also started wearing pyjamas in bed, something you\u2019d never done before, not even when you were pregnant. And they weren\u2019t particularly flattering either, not that Harry would ever say anything, he\u2019d just always admired that you used to be comfortable enough around him to sleep naked.</p><p>But the truth was you didn\u2019t hate him, quite the opposite in fact. You just didn\u2019t feel worthy of him anymore, because not only were you no longer pregnant but your body was also no what it used to be. You\u2019d never been particularly thin anyway, but even still you\u2019d never felt less confident in yourself.</p><p>You\u2019d heard a girl call her legs tree trunks once and thought she was ridiculous for putting herself down in such a way, but now you can certainly see where she was coming from when you look down at your own legs. Your stretch marks grew from the curve of your arse all the way down to your mid thighs, and they were even worse on your still bloated stomach, stretching right across your front so that you looked like a fucking weird coloured tiger.</p><p>Yeah, you\u2019d never felt like a match for your husband before, so you certainly didn\u2019t feel like one now.</p><p>A small bubble of noise came from the Moses basket beside your bed, pulling you from your light slumber. In your new conscious state you\u2019re aware of the fact that during the night Harry has edged his way into the middle of the bed and laid a lazy arm over your side, lacing his fingers with yours. It makes you feel guilty.</p><p>You sit up, slipping your hand out of his to fawn over your little girl\u2019s blanket. You\u2019re aware that Harry\u2019s hand has remained glued to your fleshy hip as you start to coo at your baby, his thumb rubbing a soft circle into your buried hip bone, indicating that he\u2019s awake.</p><p>\u201cHi pretty girl.\u201d You whisper quietly to her, beaming down at her as you stroke her cheek while flutters her eyes open and closed, making the most adorable noises you think you\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cDid we have a good sleep? I think we did because it\u2019s nearly nine o\u2019clock and we\u2019ve actually had a lie in.\u201d</p><p>You can feel Harry\u2019s gaze burning a hole in your back while his caresses become more fervent, his hand beginning to stroke up and down your waist under your pyjama top. It makes you nervous as you think of all the imperfections he can feel in your skin, all the little rolls he comes across every time he moves his hand up and then back down again. You decide to stop him, placing your hand on his and gently removing it whilst keeping your eyes on your seemingly happy four month old.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d Harry voice comes from behind you, and even in its deep morning husk you can hear the offence behind it.</p><p>You\u2019re not sure why you decide to play dumb because you know it\u2019s not going to do you any favours. Maybe the early hour is making you stupid. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>You hear a shuffle behind you, a you continue to play ignorant while you gaze at your baby girl, until Harry\u2019s strong arms are around your waist - this time thankfully over your top - and his head is on your shoulder. You can feel his knees lightly digging into your sides, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the hard beating of your heart.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you keep pushing me away? Like you hate me?\u201d He begs, curls brushing against your ear as he bravely kisses the side of your face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d You retort lightly, feeling more guilty that you\u2019ve given that impression. \u201cI could never hate you.\u201d And that much is true. It\u2019s scary really, how much you\u2019d think to stick by him for.</p><p>He frowns, pulling his head back along your shoulder slightly to look at you. But you\u2019re still too busy faffing over the baby who\u2019s began to wriggle wildly. \u201cWhat have I done then? Because I\u2019m so confused, love.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re not entirely sure how to answer. Your hands are too busy trying to carefully pull your infant from her cot without too much fuss, and it temporarily distracts you from his question while you settle her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, this is the longest you\u2019ve consciously let me touch you since the day we brought her home.\u201d He tells you with slight drain to his voice, his eyes glued to yours from the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>That was easy enough. \u201cI have.\u201d You mumble, because you\u2019ve been terrified to say it since your distance started. Your daughter begins wriggling restlessly, her noise still bubbling as she nods her head towards your breast.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you have?\u201d He sounds baffled. No, he\u2019s definitely beyond baffled but he persists. \u201cBecause for me the only thing that\u2019s changed is that we have a baby and you refuse to let me near you.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re sure as hell not going to have this conversation facing away from him with an aching back. You sigh, a breathe filled with strange sadness, and turn your head to finally look at him. For the first time in months you\u2019re the one to kiss him. Because he remains to be the most handsome man you\u2019ve ever seen, and weirdly enough he\u2019s yours and remains to be. \u201cCan I sit properly to feed her first?\u201d</p><p>Harry studies your gaze for a moment before nodding, pecking your lips back and detaching himself from you. He takes your infant from you, something that doesn\u2019t please her much as she begins to cry while you quickly remove your t-shirt and settle a pillow against the headboard. Harry coos at her quietly until you\u2019re holding your arms out for her again, cradling her in your arms and holding her head as she begins to feed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously love, I think this is the first time I think I\u2019ve seen you without a top on for months.\u201d And he does sound serious, there\u2019s not a hint of teasing present in his tone as he crawls to sit right beside you, facing you with his legs bent beside him, leaning on an arm that he\u2019s sat between your half crossed legs.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t feel good about myself anymore, Harry.\u201d You finally admit, giving a light shrug as your expression reads a little helpless. \u201cI feel\u2026 I don\u2019t know, horrible. Big.\u201d</p><p>Big. Without being insulting he tries to think of a way to tell you that you\u2019re being\u2026 well, silly. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had a baby\u2026 I didn\u2019t exactly expect you to just go back to normal, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that I feel bad about myself. Like, I just don\u2019t feel good enough for you.\u201d Your daughter distracts you again as her mouth detaches from your nipple, and you\u2019re quick to move her to your other breast.</p><p>As you do Harry reaches for the little cloth you keep with you, and without any hesitation he wipes the excess milk from your breast. \u201cYou think I care about any of that? Angel, I love you for you. You had a baby for me, I couldn\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re a bit bigger because of it, it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s natural. It certainly doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re my wife and I still adore you in all the ways I did before. It just means I\u2019ve got a few more reasons to love you, and a few more things to love on.\u201d</p><p>You let out a little laugh at his mini rant and watch him for a moment. He looks deadly serious, the smallest little line between his brows that tells you he means it. You do feel a bit silly, you should\u2019ve seen it coming, but insecurity is a funny thing. \u201cSo you don\u2019t mind that you suffocate if I ever lie on you again?\u201d</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes and watches the humour spread across your face. \u201cYou are ridiculous, that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight break it.\u201d You mumble, nodding to his lower region. \u201cM\u2019quite heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Harry scolds with a deeper frown, gently smacking your leg with the back of his hand. \u201cVery much doubt you\u2019ll break it. On the other hand m\u2019balls are turnin\u2019 blue.\u201d</p><p>You have to snort at that. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugs and lean towards you to press a kiss to your arm. \u201cS\u2019alright, just promise me you won\u2019t keep me waiting <i>too</i> much longer.

But you\u2019re still too busy faffing over the baby who\u2019s began to wriggle wildly. \u201cWhat have I done then? Because I\u2019m so confused, love.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re not entirely sure how to answer. Your hands are too busy trying to carefully pull your infant from her cot without too much fuss, and it temporarily distracts you from his question while you settle her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, this is the longest you\u2019ve consciously let me touch you since the day we brought her home.\u201d He tells you with slight drain to his voice, his eyes glued to yours from the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>That was easy enough. \u201cI have.\u201d You mumble, because you\u2019ve been terrified to say it since your distance started. Your daughter begins wriggling restlessly, her noise still bubbling as she nods her head towards your breast.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you have?\u201d He sounds baffled. No, he\u2019s definitely beyond baffled but he persists. \u201cBecause for me the only thing that\u2019s changed is that we have a baby and you refuse to let me near you.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re sure as hell not going to have this conversation facing away from him with an aching back. You sigh, a breathe filled with strange sadness, and turn your head to finally look at him. For the first time in months you\u2019re the one to kiss him. Because he remains to be the most handsome man you\u2019ve ever seen, and weirdly enough he\u2019s yours and remains to be. \u201cCan I sit properly to feed her first?\u201d</p><p>Harry studies your gaze for a moment before nodding, pecking your lips back and detaching himself from you. He takes your infant from you, something that doesn\u2019t please her much as she begins to cry while you quickly remove your t-shirt and settle a pillow against the headboard. Harry coos at her quietly until you\u2019re holding your arms out for her again, cradling her in your arms and holding her head as she begins to feed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously love, I think this is the first time I think I\u2019ve seen you without a top on for months.\u201d And he does sound serious, there\u2019s not a hint of teasing present in his tone as he crawls to sit right beside you, facing you with his legs bent beside him, leaning on an arm that he\u2019s sat between your half crossed legs.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t feel good about myself anymore, Harry.\u201d You finally admit, giving a light shrug as your expression reads a little helpless. \u201cI feel\u2026 I don\u2019t know, horrible. Big.\u201d</p><p>Big. Without being insulting he tries to think of a way to tell you that you\u2019re being\u2026 well, silly. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had a baby\u2026 I didn\u2019t exactly expect you to just go back to normal, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that I feel bad about myself. Like, I just don\u2019t feel good enough for you.\u201d Your daughter distracts you again as her mouth detaches from your nipple, and you\u2019re quick to move her to your other breast.</p><p>As you do Harry reaches for the little cloth you keep with you, and without any hesitation he wipes the excess milk from your breast. \u201cYou think I care about any of that? Angel, I love you for you. You had a baby for me, I couldn\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re a bit bigger because of it, it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s natural. It certainly doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re my wife and I still adore you in all the ways I did before. It just means I\u2019ve got a few more reasons to love you, and a few more things to love on.\u201d</p><p>You let out a little laugh at his mini rant and watch him for a moment. He looks deadly serious, the smallest little line between his brows that tells you he means it. You do feel a bit silly, you should\u2019ve seen it coming, but insecurity is a funny thing. \u201cSo you don\u2019t mind that you suffocate if I ever lie on you again?\u201d</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes and watches the humour spread across your face. \u201cYou are ridiculous, that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight break it.\u201d You mumble, nodding to his lower region. \u201cM\u2019quite heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Harry scolds with a deeper frown, gently smacking your leg with the back of his hand. \u201cVery much doubt you\u2019ll break it. On the other hand m\u2019balls are turnin\u2019 blue.\u201d</p><p>You have to snort at that. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugs and lean towards you to press a kiss to your arm. \u201cS\u2019alright, just promise me you won\u2019t keep me waiting <i>too</i> much longer. Might combust otherwise.\u201d</p><p>You giggle lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/184008367699/loved-loved-that-blurb-u-recently-posted\">Part II</a>~</b></p><p><b></b>Yeah, I actually love this so\u2026</p><p>Tag list: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@ijustloveharrystyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> </p>",
                "content": "<p><i><b>I&rsquo;m getting really shit with answering requests aren&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;ve been sitting on this one for a while because I wanted to do it some justice but I&rsquo;m super proud of it so I hope you are too! </b></i></p><p>Pregnancy always was enchanting to Harry. He&rsquo;d said it on so many occasions, that you being pregnant, a little swollen belly and glowing skin, your hair full of a whole new bounce and your eyes exceptionally bright, was his absolute favourite thing. Knowing that you were homing his little baby inside until he or she was ready to come out into the world, it was like you were a gift from the Gods.</p><p>Your entire pregnancy he&rsquo;d barely left your side, attending to your every need and answering your every beck and call. He was like a footman, concierge, bodyguard, chef, barman, spa therapist and waiter all at once, he was just always there. At one point early on he&rsquo;d started to irritate you with how much fuss he was making over you, but you never mentioned it because you knew it would only cause an argument not worth having, and you knew you&rsquo;d come out the other side looking extremely ungrateful.</p><p>And then your daughter was born and everything changed.</p><p>Harry had noticed your distance from him. No, not from the baby, from him. You were infatuated with her, barely left her alone to the point that when Harry held her you were jealous. But you seemed to shy away from him at every opportunity, avoiding his touch and affection towards you like you hated him.</p><p>Even with your daughter sleeping between you in bed for the first few months, after she started sleeping in her cot you still slept right on the edge of the bed, as far away from him as possible. The doctors recommended six weeks before having intercourse again, and here Harry was four months later feeling a little heavy down below.</p><p>You&rsquo;d also started wearing pyjamas in bed, something you&rsquo;d never done before, not even when you were pregnant. And they weren&rsquo;t particularly flattering either, not that Harry would ever say anything, he&rsquo;d just always admired that you used to be comfortable enough around him to sleep naked.</p><p>But the truth was you didn&rsquo;t hate him, quite the opposite in fact. You just didn&rsquo;t feel worthy of him anymore, because not only were you no longer pregnant but your body was also no what it used to be. You&rsquo;d never been particularly thin anyway, but even still you&rsquo;d never felt less confident in yourself.</p><p>You&rsquo;d heard a girl call her legs tree trunks once and thought she was ridiculous for putting herself down in such a way, but now you can certainly see where she was coming from when you look down at your own legs. Your stretch marks grew from the curve of your arse all the way down to your mid thighs, and they were even worse on your still bloated stomach, stretching right across your front so that you looked like a fucking weird coloured tiger.</p><p>Yeah, you&rsquo;d never felt like a match for your husband before, so you certainly didn&rsquo;t feel like one now.</p><p>A small bubble of noise came from the Moses basket beside your bed, pulling you from your light slumber. In your new conscious state you&rsquo;re aware of the fact that during the night Harry has edged his way into the middle of the bed and laid a lazy arm over your side, lacing his fingers with yours. It makes you feel guilty.</p><p>You sit up, slipping your hand out of his to fawn over your little girl&rsquo;s blanket. You&rsquo;re aware that Harry&rsquo;s hand has remained glued to your fleshy hip as you start to coo at your baby, his thumb rubbing a soft circle into your buried hip bone, indicating that he&rsquo;s awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi pretty girl.&rdquo; You whisper quietly to her, beaming down at her as you stroke her cheek while flutters her eyes open and closed, making the most adorable noises you think you&rsquo;ve ever heard. &ldquo;Did we have a good sleep? I think we did because it&rsquo;s nearly nine o&rsquo;clock and we&rsquo;ve actually had a lie in.&rdquo;</p><p>You can feel Harry&rsquo;s gaze burning a hole in your back while his caresses become more fervent, his hand beginning to stroke up and down your waist under your pyjama top. It makes you nervous as you think of all the imperfections he can feel in your skin, all the little rolls he comes across every time he moves his hand up and then back down again. You decide to stop him, placing your hand on his and gently removing it whilst keeping your eyes on your seemingly happy four month old.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you do that?&rdquo; Harry voice comes from behind you, and even in its deep morning husk you can hear the offence behind it.</p><p>You&rsquo;re not sure why you decide to play dumb because you know it&rsquo;s not going to do you any favours. Maybe the early hour is making you stupid. &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</p><p>You hear a shuffle behind you, a you continue to play ignorant while you gaze at your baby girl, until Harry&rsquo;s strong arms are around your waist - this time thankfully over your top - and his head is on your shoulder. You can feel his knees lightly digging into your sides, but that&rsquo;s nothing compared to the hard beating of your heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you keep pushing me away? Like you hate me?&rdquo; He begs, curls brushing against your ear as he bravely kisses the side of your face.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate you.&rdquo; You retort lightly, feeling more guilty that you&rsquo;ve given that impression. &ldquo;I could never hate you.&rdquo; And that much is true. It&rsquo;s scary really, how much you&rsquo;d think to stick by him for.</p><p>He frowns, pulling his head back along your shoulder slightly to look at you. But you&rsquo;re still too busy faffing over the baby who&rsquo;s began to wriggle wildly. &ldquo;What have I done then?
