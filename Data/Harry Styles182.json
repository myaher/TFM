Naturally, I had to use another Red Hot Chili Peppers song because I\u2019m destructive&hellip; ok here we go</b>. <i>(Dedicated to the ever lovely <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> for being the best hype woman as I wrote this)</i></p><p>A soft moan of contentment escapes your mouth as your eyes slowly open, and a smile graces your lips. Your eyes wander around the room, and a foreign feeling makes itself known to you; peacefulness. </p><p>The thoughts of what happened last night between you and Harry fill your mind, and you smile even wider. After the Met Gala, the two of you came back to his apartment where you both shared a relaxing bath, and began a long intimate, loving night. </p><p>All the pleasure, sexiness, and <i>love </i>of it all is fresh in your mind as the man beside you let\u2019s out a groan, and slowly opens up his enticing green eyes to look at you adoringly. </p><p>\u201cMorning sleepyhead,\u201d you greet him with a soft peck to his lips, and move to push some of his growing curls away from his face; a gesture you always do affectionately when it comes to your boyfriend of four years. \u201cWell rested I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know,\u201d he replies with a chuckle. \u201cHow about you, love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI slept great,\u201d you tell him honestly, and watch happily as his dimples make themselves known while his grin widens. \u201cIt was the best sleep I\u2019ve had in a while actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asks, and absentmindedly places a soft kiss on the back of your hand. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you state, slightly confused by his question. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re not even awake right now,\u201d he answers, while he moves to place more kisses along your exposed shoulders and collarbone. </p><p>\u201cNot awake?\u201d You ask disbelievingly. \u201cHarry, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else as his trail of kisses slowly moves up your neck, and finally speaks again once he moves away slightly so his eyes meet yours. \u201cWake up, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>With a sudden jolt, you sit upwards in your hotel room bed desperately trying to catch your breath. You place a hand on your chest in attempts to calm the rapid thumping of your heart, as you glance around and remember where you actually are. </p><p>You aren\u2019t laying in Harry\u2019s king-sized bed with him, no, you\u2019re curled up alone in the double bed of a downtown Manhattan hotel you managed to get a room in on <i>very</i> short notice. </p><p>Once you feel you\u2019ve calmed down a little bit, you reach over to the bedside table and grab your phone so you can look at the time.\u00a0A frown forms on your lips as you see the time to be 3:30am, and realize what you thought you were just experiencing was actually a sick twisted dream.</p><!-- more --><p>You stare at the screen a bit longer to look at the multiple notifications of missed calls and texts from Harry, and your heart pangs at the sight of the picture of the two of you that\u2019s saved as your lock screen; him looking at you lovingly as he gives you a piggyback, and you smiling ridiculously large. You felt good when Anne snapped this picture of the two of you last year at Christmas, and can&rsquo;t help but wonder where that feeling went.\u00a0</p><p>With a shaky breath, you set the phone back onto the table, and roll back over to try and get some more sleep&hellip; However, it\u00a0doesn\u2019t really work out that way.\u00a0</p><p>Much to your dismay, the next hour or so consists of you tossing and turning; trying to relieve yourself from the sad thoughts, but it just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p>It isn\u2019t until you reach up to tiredly rub at your eyes that you notice the tears that formed had escaped and were streaming down your face. A small scoff-like laugh leaves your mouth as you start feeling as if your life has become that of what can be imagined when listening to the saddest Coldplay songs, and you honestly hate it.\u00a0</p><p>You reach the point of being extremely fed up with your anxious mind, and decide that maybe some fresh air will help calm you down.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re quick in throwing on a pair of tights, and the baggy sweater you grabbed when you made a quick pit stop at Harry\u2019s apartment to grab some things after leaving him at the Met Gala.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the sweater is pulled over your head, you immediately realize this sweater isn\u2019t even your\u2019s but is one Harry\u2019s. The scent of his favourite cologne overwhelms you, and you immediately want to take it off. However, you really don&rsquo;t have the choice seeing as these are the only pieces of warm clothing you managed to grab in your short visit to the apartment; wasting no time there out of fear Harry may have come home looking for you.\u00a0</p><p>With another quick breath, you grab your phone from the bedside table and make way down to the hotel lobby.\u00a0</p><p>The mild weather of this lovely May night would normally be appreciated by you as you wander around the fairly empty streets of New York City, but you\u2019re unable to enjoy such little things as your mind continues racing.\u00a0</p><p>Did you make a mistake? The last thing you wanted to do was hurt your boyfriend, but this is honestly something you feel that needed to be done. You can&rsquo;t help but think of how Harry doesn\u2019t need to be brought down by your poor thoughts about yourself, he has enough going on in his hectic life; so maybe this break <i>will</i> be beneficial to the both of you - regardless of you not being completely sold on the idea that this is truly what you want.\u00a0</p><p>For the last four years Harry has been your rock, hell even since before the two of you started dating he was always this constant person in your life.\u00a0</p><p>You met him back in 2013 during his One Direction glory days; when he was at the ripe age of nineteen. The two of you met through a mutual friend and hit it off immediately, however it wasn\u2019t until Christmastime of the following year that he finally asked you to be his girlfriend; which you gladly agreed to, despite what it entailed.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ve given up a lot during your relationship with Harry, but he\u2019s always made it worth it to you; even in the hard times.\u00a0</p><p>Over the last four years you\u2019ve received criticism from friends, family, fans of his, and the media all regarding the pairing that was you and world renown pop star Harry Styles; but he was never like that behind closed doors&hellip; He was always just, Harry, and that was the man you grew to love. The man who actually understood you, and didn&rsquo;t try to ignore your mental health when it was thrown in his face.\u00a0</p><p>Anxiety has always been this monster lurking in the shadows, following you wherever you go - just waiting for the most inconvenient time to make itself known. One of the worst panic attacks you&rsquo;ve ever experienced happened when landing in LAX less than a year into your relationship. The two of you were swarmed by fans and paparazzi once you both stepped foot into the terminal, and you quickly became over whelmed; trying your best to not cry in front of all these people as you were pushed away from your boyfriend. \u00a0</p><p>Harry on the other hand, handed everything with grace and ease. After greeting his fans in a friendly manner, he politely excused himself so he could grab ahold of your hand and allow his security team to direct the two of you away from the mayhem. The incident took a toll on you, but also Harry as he was left feeling extremely bad for what had just happened, and vowed to protect you to the best of his ability in any circumstance, always.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s been\u00a0truthful to that promise and you never had a doubt in your mind that he wouldn\u2019t be; hell, just last night was a perfect example of that with how he handled the paparazzi attacking you&hellip; And realizing that is when it really hit\u2019s you.\u00a0</p><p>Harry has not only been your rock; but is also your home. He never made you feel like you <i>needed</i> to be protected or anything of that sense, it was just his overall goal to make sure you felt safe and happy; especially when you were together - it\u2019s all he cared about.\u00a0</p><p>It was shown through the small gestures he\u2019s made over the years that barely crossed your mind. The late night back rubs, the running of baths after excruciatingly long days, his daily FaceTime calls while being\u00a0away on tour so you can be one of the first things he sees once he\u2019s awake and the last before he goes to sleep, along with everything else in between; this man revolved his world around you, and it\u2019s taken you until now to realize it. \u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t notice the tears streaming down your face for yet another time tonight, until you find yourself attempting to choke back a sob as it desperately tries to escape. Your anxiety has gotten the best of you again, and you\u2019re devastated by the thought of something you\u2019ve\u00a0decided you needed in order to feel better - only has made you feel worse about everything, and has left you feeling pretty damn lonely.\u00a0</p><p>You may have just lost the greatest thing in your life simply by pushing him away, and that thought hurts like a bitch.\u00a0</p><p>You&rsquo;ve spent the last twenty minutes so consumed by your thoughts and memories, that you didn\u2019t even realize where you were allowing your feet to take you. As you shake your head to recollect yourself, you round another corner and find yourself surrounded by the bright lights of Times Square.\u00a0</p><p>Normally you wouldn\u2019t mind this, seeing as Times Square is a very intriguing place in and of it\u2019s own; but you aren\u2019t able to enjoy it as much as you once have when almost instantly two other people standing nearby recognize you.\u00a0</p><p>First off, you\u2019re confused by why there\u2019s so many people in the square this late at night; but then again this is NYC. It\u2019s\u00a0city that never sleeps, right? Second, you\u2019re unsure of how these two were so quick in pointing you out from all the other people here as well; coming to the conclusion that maybe the word <i>Harry</i>\u00a0being stitched into your sweater above your heart might&rsquo;ve been the give away in that matter.\u00a0</p><p>The two girls stare at you as you smile awkwardly, and scurry on past them; trying your best to not make a comment of the pictures they are so obviously snapping on their cell phones as you go by. You make it only a few more steps before someone decides to call out after you, and internally groan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d it says, and you freeze.\u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s Harry?\u201d You close your eyes and take a breath to calm yourself from the uneasy feeling that\u2019s developing in your gut, slowly turning around to face where the voice just came from; however, you are not prepared to be met by the scene that is taking place behind you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Not only are the other\u2019s who had been in the square as well have gathered around you, but some paparazzi are here too; snapping pictures and yelling questions, leading you to believe they\u2019ve literally just popped up out of thin air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it true you and Harry broke up tonight?\u201d One of the fans question, and you move your watering eyes to face them. You try your best to find a response, but soon become overwhelmed as more and more people begin closing in on you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The all too familiar panicky feeling you felt with Harry at the Met Gala, as well as the one you felt at LAX all those years ago begins making itself known, and you start taking deep rapid breaths. You can\u2019t find it in you to respond, and that\u2019s when a hand grabs ahold of your wrist and starts pulling.\u00a0</p><p>You can\u2019t help but be alarmed by the sudden gesture. However, the person seems to be on a mission; flawlessly weaving you between members of the crowd that\u2019s formed around you, and making way towards some of the taxi\u2019s idling nearby.\u00a0</p><p>They don\u2019t release the grip they have on your arm until the two of you reach one of the cabs, and you gently yank your wrist away as they open the door to climb in one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you speak up, and sniffle; quickly glancing over your shoulder at the crowd of people following after you.\u00a0\u201cWho are you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSomeone you can trust,\u201d the person replies, and slowly turns around to look at you. Even with the hood pulled over the top of their head, and the large sunglasses on their face; you instantly recognize them as none other than one of your favourite people ever.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d you whisper to yourself in relief, but can tell she\u2019s heard you by the smile that stretches across her face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThe one and only,\u201d she smirks, and motions for you to get into the taxi.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d<br/></p><p>You quickly oblige to her demands, and the cab takes off as soon as the two of you are inside. You glance at the crowd of people one last time as they appear smaller in the distance, and let out a sigh of relief before turning to look at Harry\u2019s sister.\u00a0\u201cThank you for that Gem-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d She interrupts, and rips off her sunglasses so she can glare at you.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s five o\u2019clock in the morning, and you thought it\u2019d be a good idea to walk around New York <i>alone</i>? Holy shit, Harry would loose it if he ever found it&hellip; Oh my god if something were to happen and-.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I promise,\u201d you cut her off this time, and she takes a breath.\u00a0\u201cOverwhelmed, yes, but fine.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I knew you&rsquo;d be ok regardless, I\u2019m talking about the not so nice people you can meet walking alone at night, Y/N,\u201d she explains, and you nod in agreement.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, not my best idea,\u201d you tell her, and she smirks.\u00a0\u201cBut- why were <i>you </i>walking\u00a0around Times Square this late?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI was with Michal,\u201d she tells you.\u00a0\u201cWe met up with Harry after the gala, and sat with him in a little pizza shop as he sulked. Dropped him off at home about twenty minutes ago, and then made way to Times Square just for fun. We were sitting on the red stairs when I saw those people crowding around you&hellip; Told Michal to head back to the hotel, and I came to grab you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMuch appreciated,\u201d you thank her with a smile.\u00a0\u201cH-how\u2019s Harry?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hurting,\u201d she explains, as you bite down on your bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cYou\u00a0wouldn\u2019t be able to tell with how hard he tried to keep it together during the gala, but when he was with us; he wasn\u2019t doing too great. He\u2019s more confused than anything, and it\u2019s all just seems to be eating him alive.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThis is all my fault,\u201d you whisper, and wipe away a stray tear that broke free.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNone of this is your fault, Y/N,\u201d she states firmly.\u00a0\u201cI love my brother, and it hurts seeing him upset; but your mental health is also extremely important. If you feel a break is what needs to be done in order to help whatever it is going on, you&rsquo;re entitled to that. Harry understands, he just&hellip; I think he feels helpless. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to feel pain or suffer, especially when it comes to those he loves most.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure this was the right choice anymore,\u201d you mumble in response, and glance out the window.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t realize how much you actually need a person until they&rsquo;re gone. I feel like this could\u2019ve just been avoided if I told Harry about how I was feeling, rather than bottling it up like I always do.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not too late to tell him,\u201d she responds as the cab comes to a slow stop. You send her a confused glance before looking out the window again, and seeing you\u2019re now parked outside Harry\u2019s apartment building.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you plan this?\u201d You ask incredulously, and snap your gaze back to her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she answers with a shrug.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t force you to talk to him, but\u00a0I&rsquo;m really hoping you do because I already consider you my sister. Harry deserves someone as good as you, Y/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>Your heart swells at her words, and you feel as if you could burst. Gemma has become one of your really good friends over the last four years, and hearing her say that has you taken back; but in the best way possible.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe you <i>are</i> enough for Harry, and maybe it\u2019s time that you realize that.\u00a0</p><p>With a small nod, and a quick goodbye to your friend; you climb out of the taxi, and make way towards the apartment complex.\u00a0</p><p>As you reach Harry\u2019s floor you can hear muffled music playing from down the hall, and know well enough that it\u2019s your melodramatic boyfriend trying to dig himself further into the pit of despair. The distinctive voice of Anthony Kiedis becomes clearer as you reach the door, and you can\u2019t help but chuckle a little bit at his choice of music. This bitch is blaring Red Hot Chili Peppers at 5:30am, and hasn\u2019t gotten a noise complaint? Shocking.\u00a0</p><p>You try your best to not get nervous as you slowly unlock the door with your key, and quietly make your way inside. Every light is off in the apartment minus the faint glow of a lamp in the bedroom that illuminates the hallway a little bit through the slightly cracked open door.\u00a0</p><p>Quietly, you pad down the hall and peak through the crack of the door to see what scene is taking place on the other side.\u00a0</p><p>Harry lays motionless at the base of the bed with his legs hanging over the edge, gently tapping his fingers against the duvet as <i>Under The Bridge </i>begins playing from his vinyl record player over in the corner of the room. He\u2019s still dressed in the suit he wore this evening to host the Met Gala, but is missing his jacket; which happens to be laying on the ground beside his foot in a wrinkled mess.\u00a0You shake your head again, and slowly push the door open so you can make your presence known.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought I was the overly dramatic one in this relationship, Styles,\u201d you greet as you lean against the doorframe, a smug grin dancing on your lips. He instantly sit\u2019s up, and looks at you as if he\u2019s seeing a ghost; completely speechless, and unsure of what to do. You pull your bottom lip in between your teeth, and awkwardly glance over to the record player as the song goes into it\u2019s chorus.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t ever want to feel like you did that day, hmm? Yeah, me neither.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he finally speaks up, and cautiously stands up from the bed; as if he\u2019s afraid you might get scared and run off again.\u00a0\u201cW-what-.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAm I doing here?\u201d You finish for him, and push yourself away from the doorway to step towards him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fixing something that should\u2019ve never been broken.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd what is that exactly?\u201d He faintly asks, but you can hear him loud and clear.\u00a0\u201cY/N, I\u2019m so sorry if I ever made you feel like you were alone in any of this. That is the last thing I wanted to happen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you tell him honestly, and come to a stop about a foot away; glancing up into his green eyes that never fail to make your breath hitch. \u201cAnd as much as I wish I could put the blame on someone else, this really isn&rsquo;t your fault Harry. It\u2019s my own.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo it really isn\u2019t, love,\u201d he argues, and reaches out to gently grab your hands with his; making no effort in hiding the relief that takes over his features as you don\u2019t pull away from him.\u00a0\u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling, and what you&rsquo;re going through is valid Y/N. <i>You</i> are valid.\u201d<br/></p><p>The tears begin welling up in your eyes, and he\u2019s quick in pushing away the ones that break free with the soft pads of his thumbs; keeping his hands placed on either side of your face.\u00a0\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve been with to make me feel ok in my own skin. To not be ashamed of who I am, despite the internal battles that consume my thoughts sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bub,\u201d whispers sadly.\u00a0\u201cWhy don&rsquo;t you ever talk to me about these things?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause my mind can be a scary place sometimes Harry,\u201d you explain, and exhale deeply.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s hard to share what goes on up there, but it\u2019s something I want to work on. I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to feel the way I do, and I think actually opening up about it can help a lot. There comes times where I feel like I\u2019m\u00a0being walked all over, in a lot of ways. Some have to do with you, but more have to do with me because I let it happen; and I want that to change. The things people say about us, about me&hellip; I let them get to me when I really shouldn&rsquo;t, which can create a lot of problems. Their opinion doesn&rsquo;t matter when all I care about is this incredible man that has decided to share his whirlwind of a life with someone like me. It\u2019s surreal, and I think it\u2019s time I realize that maybe I am worthy of this life. I am good enough to be overly in love with you, and have no need to not feel that way. And <i>I\u2019m </i>sorry if\u00a0I&rsquo;ve ever made it out to seem like I\u2019m not this special, important person that you make insanely happy&hellip; Because maybe I am. Clearly there\u2019s something about me that appeals to the amazing person you are, and it\u2019s finally time I accept that. So thank you, Harry. I-.\u201d<br/></p><p>Your rant is cut short as his lips crash to yours hungrily, but oh so affectionately. It\u2019s exactly what you need in this moment, and Harry was quick in picking up on that like he always is. His arms snake around your waist so he can pull you against his chest, and deepen the kiss; all while your arms link around the back of his neck to do the same&hellip; Mentally smacking yourself for ever thinking you\u2019d ever want a break from <i>this</i>.</p><p>After a few moments, he slowly pulls away and places his forehead against yours; smiling at you cheekily, making sure to show off his dimples that makes you want to melt in his hold.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy it makes me to hear you say that,\u201d he starts, and you can feel a blush creeping across your cheeks.\u00a0\u201cBecause, you are&hellip; everything Y/N. There\u2019s no one out there as perfect for me as you are, and I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re finally realizing that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell now you&rsquo;re just being cheesy,\u201d you respond jokingly, and place a soft peck to his lips.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou love it,\u201d he snarks, before pulling you in for a tight bear hug.\u00a0\u201cM\u2019glad to have you back, bub.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou never lost me,\u201d you tell him, and nuzzle your head into him.\u00a0\u201cYou pretty well have me wrapped around your finger at this point. I\u2019d follow you anywhere.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd\u00a0I&rsquo;ll always want you there,\u201d he states, and places a kiss onto the top of your head.\u00a0\u201cHow about you follow me to the washroom though, hmm? I think we both deserve a relaxing bath after such a night.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I had a dream\u00a0that started off like this,\u201d you explain with a chuckle as you think back to what originally woke you up during this already long night.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d He asks, and moves away to raise an eyebrow at you.\u00a0\u201cWell I say we make it a reality then.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCouldn&rsquo;t agree more,\u201d you reply, and let him start leading you towards the en-suite. He steps over his suit jacket that lays in a ball on the floor, and you role your eyes at his laziness; letting go of his hand so you can grab it.\u00a0\u201cHarry this is expensive, pick up after yourself.\u201d<br/></p><p>He goes to stop you, but is too late as you lift it from the ground and a small black felt box falls out of the pocket.\u00a0\u201cY/N-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d You ask, and bend down to pick it up as well. Looking it over in your hand, before glancing back to your boyfriend; who has a goofy grin on his face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d he instructs, and steps closer to you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Confused by why he\u2019s acting so strange all of a sudden, you oblige and open the box to reveal a stunning diamond ring inside of it. You scrunch your face at it slightly; unsure of why he has this, but then it clicks.\u00a0\u201cOh my god - Harry,\u201d you gasp, and place a hand over your mouth in shock.\u00a0</p><p>When you move your gaze back to him you find that he\u2019s no longer standing in front of you, but rather kneeling, and your breath gets completely caught in your throat at the sight.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to do this grand gesture to show you how badly I need you in my life Y/N, but have come to realize that we&rsquo;re the best at showing our love for each other through the little things,\u201d he begins, and the waterworks start all over again.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to ask you tonight at the Met&hellip; but now seems just about as good of a time as any. So, Y/N. Will you make me the happiest man on this planet by saying you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re at a loss of words at his gesture and all around love you have for him, that you just find yourself shaking your head.\u00a0\u201cI-I don&rsquo;t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t mind too much if you said yes,\u201d he responds in an almost pleading manner.\u00a0\u201cIf m\u2019being completely honest.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you, you doofus,\u201d you answer and lean down to crash your lips against his lovingly. He responds instantly by pulling you closer as he stands up, and grabs the ring out of the box. As much as he doesn&rsquo;t want to break the feeling of your lips against his, he breaks away from the kiss so he can slide the ring onto you finger.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLooks better there than it did in the box,\u201d he states, and smiles at you; basically causing you heart to absolutely melt. He leans in for another peck, before ending the quick kiss so he can mumble against your lips.\u00a0\u201cGlad to have you home, soon to-be Mrs. Styles.\u201d<br/></p>",

You felt good when Anne snapped this picture of the two of you last year at Christmas, and can\u2019t help but wonder where that feeling went.\u00a0</p><p>With a shaky breath, you set the phone back onto the table, and roll back over to try and get some more sleep\u2026 However, it\u00a0doesn\u2019t really work out that way.\u00a0</p><p>Much to your dismay, the next hour or so consists of you tossing and turning; trying to relieve yourself from the sad thoughts, but it just doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p>It isn\u2019t until you reach up to tiredly rub at your eyes that you notice the tears that formed had escaped and were streaming down your face. A small scoff-like laugh leaves your mouth as you start feeling as if your life has become that of what can be imagined when listening to the saddest Coldplay songs, and you honestly hate it.\u00a0</p><p>You reach the point of being extremely fed up with your anxious mind, and decide that maybe some fresh air will help calm you down.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re quick in throwing on a pair of tights, and the baggy sweater you grabbed when you made a quick pit stop at Harry\u2019s apartment to grab some things after leaving him at the Met Gala.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the sweater is pulled over your head, you immediately realize this sweater isn\u2019t even your\u2019s but is one Harry\u2019s. The scent of his favourite cologne overwhelms you, and you immediately want to take it off. However, you really don\u2019t have the choice seeing as these are the only pieces of warm clothing you managed to grab in your short visit to the apartment; wasting no time there out of fear Harry may have come home looking for you.\u00a0</p><p>With another quick breath, you grab your phone from the bedside table and make way down to the hotel lobby.\u00a0</p><p>The mild weather of this lovely May night would normally be appreciated by you as you wander around the fairly empty streets of New York City, but you\u2019re unable to enjoy such little things as your mind continues racing.\u00a0</p><p>Did you make a mistake? The last thing you wanted to do was hurt your boyfriend, but this is honestly something you feel that needed to be done. You can\u2019t help but think of how Harry doesn\u2019t need to be brought down by your poor thoughts about yourself, he has enough going on in his hectic life; so maybe this break <i>will</i> be beneficial to the both of you - regardless of you not being completely sold on the idea that this is truly what you want.\u00a0</p><p>For the last four years Harry has been your rock, hell even since before the two of you started dating he was always this constant person in your life.\u00a0</p><p>You met him back in 2013 during his One Direction glory days; when he was at the ripe age of nineteen. The two of you met through a mutual friend and hit it off immediately, however it wasn\u2019t until Christmastime of the following year that he finally asked you to be his girlfriend; which you gladly agreed to, despite what it entailed.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ve given up a lot during your relationship with Harry, but he\u2019s always made it worth it to you; even in the hard times.\u00a0</p><p>Over the last four years you\u2019ve received criticism from friends, family, fans of his, and the media all regarding the pairing that was you and world renown pop star Harry Styles; but he was never like that behind closed doors\u2026 He was always just, Harry, and that was the man you grew to love. The man who actually understood you, and didn\u2019t try to ignore your mental health when it was thrown in his face.\u00a0</p><p>Anxiety has always been this monster lurking in the shadows, following you wherever you go - just waiting for the most inconvenient time to make itself known. One of the worst panic attacks you\u2019ve ever experienced happened when landing in LAX less than a year into your relationship. The two of you were swarmed by fans and paparazzi once you both stepped foot into the terminal, and you quickly became over whelmed; trying your best to not cry in front of all these people as you were pushed away from your boyfriend. \u00a0</p><p>Harry on the other hand, handed everything with grace and ease. After greeting his fans in a friendly manner, he politely excused himself so he could grab ahold of your hand and allow his security team to direct the two of you away from the mayhem. The incident took a toll on you, but also Harry as he was left feeling extremely bad for what had just happened, and vowed to protect you to the best of his ability in any circumstance, always.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s been\u00a0truthful to that promise and you never had a doubt in your mind that he wouldn\u2019t be; hell, just last night was a perfect example of that with how he handled the paparazzi attacking you\u2026 And realizing that is when it really hit\u2019s you.\u00a0</p><p>Harry has not only been your rock; but is also your home. He never made you feel like you <i>needed</i> to be protected or anything of that sense, it was just his overall goal to make sure you felt safe and happy; especially when you were together - it\u2019s all he cared about.\u00a0</p><p>It was shown through the small gestures he\u2019s made over the years that barely crossed your mind. The late night back rubs, the running of baths after excruciatingly long days, his daily FaceTime calls while being\u00a0away on tour so you can be one of the first things he sees once he\u2019s awake and the last before he goes to sleep, along with everything else in between; this man revolved his world around you, and it\u2019s taken you until now to realize it. \u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t notice the tears streaming down your face for yet another time tonight, until you find yourself attempting to choke back a sob as it desperately tries to escape. Your anxiety has gotten the best of you again, and you\u2019re devastated by the thought of something you\u2019ve\u00a0decided you needed in order to feel better - only has made you feel worse about everything, and has left you feeling pretty damn lonely.\u00a0</p><p>You may have just lost the greatest thing in your life simply by pushing him away, and that thought hurts like a bitch.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ve spent the last twenty minutes so consumed by your thoughts and memories, that you didn\u2019t even realize where you were allowing your feet to take you. As you shake your head to recollect yourself, you round another corner and find yourself surrounded by the bright lights of Times Square.\u00a0</p><p>Normally you wouldn\u2019t mind this, seeing as Times Square is a very intriguing place in and of it\u2019s own; but you aren\u2019t able to enjoy it as much as you once have when almost instantly two other people standing nearby recognize you.\u00a0</p><p>First off, you\u2019re confused by why there\u2019s so many people in the square this late at night; but then again this is NYC. It\u2019s\u00a0city that never sleeps, right? Second, you\u2019re unsure of how these two were so quick in pointing you out from all the other people here as well; coming to the conclusion that maybe the word <i>Harry</i>\u00a0being stitched into your sweater above your heart might\u2019ve been the give away in that matter.\u00a0</p><p>The two girls stare at you as you smile awkwardly, and scurry on past them; trying your best to not make a comment of the pictures they are so obviously snapping on their cell phones as you go by. You make it only a few more steps before someone decides to call out after you, and internally groan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d it says, and you freeze.\u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s Harry?\u201d You close your eyes and take a breath to calm yourself from the uneasy feeling that\u2019s developing in your gut, slowly turning around to face where the voice just came from; however, you are not prepared to be met by the scene that is taking place behind you.\u00a0<br></p><p>Not only are the other\u2019s who had been in the square as well have gathered around you, but some paparazzi are here too; snapping pictures and yelling questions, leading you to believe they\u2019ve literally just popped up out of thin air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it true you and Harry broke up tonight?\u201d One of the fans question, and you move your watering eyes to face them. You try your best to find a response, but soon become overwhelmed as more and more people begin closing in on you.\u00a0<br></p><p>The all too familiar panicky feeling you felt with Harry at the Met Gala, as well as the one you felt at LAX all those years ago begins making itself known, and you start taking deep rapid breaths. You can\u2019t find it in you to respond, and that\u2019s when a hand grabs ahold of your wrist and starts pulling.\u00a0</p><p>You can\u2019t help but be alarmed by the sudden gesture. However, the person seems to be on a mission; flawlessly weaving you between members of the crowd that\u2019s formed around you, and making way towards some of the taxi\u2019s idling nearby.\u00a0</p><p>They don\u2019t release the grip they have on your arm until the two of you reach one of the cabs, and you gently yank your wrist away as they open the door to climb in one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you speak up, and sniffle; quickly glancing over your shoulder at the crowd of people following after you.\u00a0\u201cWho are you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSomeone you can trust,\u201d the person replies, and slowly turns around to look at you. Even with the hood pulled over the top of their head, and the large sunglasses on their face; you instantly recognize them as none other than one of your favourite people ever.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d you whisper to yourself in relief, but can tell she\u2019s heard you by the smile that stretches across her face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThe one and only,\u201d she smirks, and motions for you to get into the taxi.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d<br></p><p>You quickly oblige to her demands, and the cab takes off as soon as the two of you are inside. You glance at the crowd of people one last time as they appear smaller in the distance, and let out a sigh of relief before turning to look at Harry\u2019s sister.\u00a0\u201cThank you for that Gem-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d She interrupts, and rips off her sunglasses so she can glare at you.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s five o\u2019clock in the morning, and you thought it\u2019d be a good idea to walk around New York <i>alone</i>? Holy shit, Harry would loose it if he ever found it\u2026 Oh my god if something were to happen and-.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I promise,\u201d you cut her off this time, and she takes a breath.\u00a0\u201cOverwhelmed, yes, but fine.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I knew you\u2019d be ok regardless, I\u2019m talking about the not so nice people you can meet walking alone at night, Y/N,\u201d she explains, and you nod in agreement.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, not my best idea,\u201d you tell her, and she smirks.\u00a0\u201cBut- why were <i>you </i>walking\u00a0around Times Square this late?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI was with Michal,\u201d she tells you.\u00a0\u201cWe met up with Harry after the gala, and sat with him in a little pizza shop as he sulked. Dropped him off at home about twenty minutes ago, and then made way to Times Square just for fun. We were sitting on the red stairs when I saw those people crowding around you\u2026 Told Michal to head back to the hotel, and I came to grab you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMuch appreciated,\u201d you thank her with a smile.\u00a0\u201cH-how\u2019s Harry?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hurting,\u201d she explains, as you bite down on your bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cYou\u00a0wouldn\u2019t be able to tell with how hard he tried to keep it together during the gala, but when he was with us; he wasn\u2019t doing too great. He\u2019s more confused than anything, and it\u2019s all just seems to be eating him alive.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis is all my fault,\u201d you whisper, and wipe away a stray tear that broke free.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNone of this is your fault, Y/N,\u201d she states firmly.\u00a0\u201cI love my brother, and it hurts seeing him upset; but your mental health is also extremely important. If you feel a break is what needs to be done in order to help whatever it is going on, you\u2019re entitled to that. Harry understands, he just\u2026 I think he feels helpless. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to feel pain or suffer, especially when it comes to those he loves most.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure this was the right choice anymore,\u201d you mumble in response, and glance out the window.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t realize how much you actually need a person until they\u2019re gone. I feel like this could\u2019ve just been avoided if I told Harry about how I was feeling, rather than bottling it up like I always do.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not too late to tell him,\u201d she responds as the cab comes to a slow stop. You send her a confused glance before looking out the window again, and seeing you\u2019re now parked outside Harry\u2019s apartment building.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid you plan this?\u201d You ask incredulously, and snap your gaze back to her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she answers with a shrug.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t force you to talk to him, but\u00a0I\u2019m really hoping you do because I already consider you my sister. Harry deserves someone as good as you, Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>Your heart swells at her words, and you feel as if you could burst. Gemma has become one of your really good friends over the last four years, and hearing her say that has you taken back; but in the best way possible.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe you <i>are</i> enough for Harry, and maybe it\u2019s time that you realize that.\u00a0</p><p>With a small nod, and a quick goodbye to your friend; you climb out of the taxi, and make way towards the apartment complex.\u00a0</p><p>As you reach Harry\u2019s floor you can hear muffled music playing from down the hall, and know well enough that it\u2019s your melodramatic boyfriend trying to dig himself further into the pit of despair. The distinctive voice of Anthony Kiedis becomes clearer as you reach the door, and you can\u2019t help but chuckle a little bit at his choice of music. This bitch is blaring Red Hot Chili Peppers at 5:30am, and hasn\u2019t gotten a noise complaint? Shocking.\u00a0</p><p>You try your best to not get nervous as you slowly unlock the door with your key, and quietly make your way inside. Every light is off in the apartment minus the faint glow of a lamp in the bedroom that illuminates the hallway a little bit through the slightly cracked open door.\u00a0</p><p>Quietly, you pad down the hall and peak through the crack of the door to see what scene is taking place on the other side.\u00a0</p><p>Harry lays motionless at the base of the bed with his legs hanging over the edge, gently tapping his fingers against the duvet as <i>Under The Bridge </i>begins playing from his vinyl record player over in the corner of the room. He\u2019s still dressed in the suit he wore this evening to host the Met Gala, but is missing his jacket; which happens to be laying on the ground beside his foot in a wrinkled mess.\u00a0You shake your head again, and slowly push the door open so you can make your presence known.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought I was the overly dramatic one in this relationship, Styles,\u201d you greet as you lean against the doorframe, a smug grin dancing on your lips. He instantly sit\u2019s up, and looks at you as if he\u2019s seeing a ghost; completely speechless, and unsure of what to do. You pull your bottom lip in between your teeth, and awkwardly glance over to the record player as the song goes into it\u2019s chorus.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t ever want to feel like you did that day, hmm? Yeah, me neither.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he finally speaks up, and cautiously stands up from the bed; as if he\u2019s afraid you might get scared and run off again.\u00a0\u201cW-what-.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAm I doing here?\u201d You finish for him, and push yourself away from the doorway to step towards him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fixing something that should\u2019ve never been broken.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd what is that exactly?\u201d He faintly asks, but you can hear him loud and clear.\u00a0\u201cY/N, I\u2019m so sorry if I ever made you feel like you were alone in any of this. That is the last thing I wanted to happen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you tell him honestly, and come to a stop about a foot away; glancing up into his green eyes that never fail to make your breath hitch. \u201cAnd as much as I wish I could put the blame on someone else, this really isn\u2019t your fault Harry. It\u2019s my own.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo it really isn\u2019t, love,\u201d he argues, and reaches out to gently grab your hands with his; making no effort in hiding the relief that takes over his features as you don\u2019t pull away from him.\u00a0\u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling, and what you\u2019re going through is valid Y/N. <i>You</i> are valid.\u201d<br></p><p>The tears begin welling up in your eyes, and he\u2019s quick in pushing away the ones that break free with the soft pads of his thumbs; keeping his hands placed on either side of your face.\u00a0\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve been with to make me feel ok in my own skin. To not be ashamed of who I am, despite the internal battles that consume my thoughts sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bub,\u201d whispers sadly.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever talk to me about these things?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause my mind can be a scary place sometimes Harry,\u201d you explain, and exhale deeply.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s hard to share what goes on up there, but it\u2019s something I want to work on. I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to feel the way I do, and I think actually opening up about it can help a lot. There comes times where I feel like I\u2019m\u00a0being walked all over, in a lot of ways. Some have to do with you, but more have to do with me because I let it happen; and I want that to change. The things people say about us, about me\u2026 I let them get to me when I really shouldn\u2019t, which can create a lot of problems. Their opinion doesn\u2019t matter when all I care about is this incredible man that has decided to share his whirlwind of a life with someone like me. It\u2019s surreal, and I think it\u2019s time I realize that maybe I am worthy of this life. I am good enough to be overly in love with you, and have no need to not feel that way. And <i>I\u2019m </i>sorry if\u00a0I\u2019ve ever made it out to seem like I\u2019m not this special, important person that you make insanely happy\u2026 Because maybe I am. Clearly there\u2019s something about me that appeals to the amazing person you are, and it\u2019s finally time I accept that. So thank you, Harry. I-.\u201d<br></p><p>Your rant is cut short as his lips crash to yours hungrily, but oh so affectionately. It\u2019s exactly what you need in this moment, and Harry was quick in picking up on that like he always is. His arms snake around your waist so he can pull you against his chest, and deepen the kiss; all while your arms link around the back of his neck to do the same\u2026 Mentally smacking yourself for ever thinking you\u2019d ever want a break from <i>this</i>.</p><p>After a few moments, he slowly pulls away and places his forehead against yours; smiling at you cheekily, making sure to show off his dimples that makes you want to melt in his hold.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy it makes me to hear you say that,\u201d he starts, and you can feel a blush creeping across your cheeks.\u00a0\u201cBecause, you are\u2026 everything Y/N. There\u2019s no one out there as perfect for me as you are, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finally realizing that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell now you\u2019re just being cheesy,\u201d you respond jokingly, and place a soft peck to his lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou love it,\u201d he snarks, before pulling you in for a tight bear hug.\u00a0\u201cM\u2019glad to have you back, bub.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou never lost me,\u201d you tell him, and nuzzle your head into him.\u00a0\u201cYou pretty well have me wrapped around your finger at this point. I\u2019d follow you anywhere.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\u00a0I\u2019ll always want you there,\u201d he states, and places a kiss onto the top of your head.\u00a0\u201cHow about you follow me to the washroom though, hmm? I think we both deserve a relaxing bath after such a night.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I had a dream\u00a0that started off like this,\u201d you explain with a chuckle as you think back to what originally woke you up during this already long night.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d He asks, and moves away to raise an eyebrow at you.\u00a0\u201cWell I say we make it a reality then.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d you reply, and let him start leading you towards the en-suite. He steps over his suit jacket that lays in a ball on the floor, and you role your eyes at his laziness; letting go of his hand so you can grab it.\u00a0\u201cHarry this is expensive, pick up after yourself.\u201d<br></p><p>He goes to stop you, but is too late as you lift it from the ground and a small black felt box falls out of the pocket.\u00a0\u201cY/N-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d You ask, and bend down to pick it up as well. Looking it over in your hand, before glancing back to your boyfriend; who has a goofy grin on his face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d he instructs, and steps closer to you.\u00a0<br></p><p>Confused by why he\u2019s acting so strange all of a sudden, you oblige and open the box to reveal a stunning diamond ring inside of it. You scrunch your face at it slightly; unsure of why he has this, but then it clicks.\u00a0\u201cOh my god - Harry,\u201d you gasp, and place a hand over your mouth in shock.\u00a0</p><p>When you move your gaze back to him you find that he\u2019s no longer standing in front of you, but rather kneeling, and your breath gets completely caught in your throat at the sight.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to do this grand gesture to show you how badly I need you in my life Y/N, but have come to realize that we\u2019re the best at showing our love for each other through the little things,\u201d he begins, and the waterworks start all over again.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to ask you tonight at the Met\u2026 but now seems just about as good of a time as any. So, Y/N. Will you make me the happiest man on this planet by saying you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re at a loss of words at his gesture and all around love you have for him, that you just find yourself shaking your head.\u00a0\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t mind too much if you said yes,\u201d he responds in an almost pleading manner.\u00a0\u201cIf m\u2019being completely honest.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you, you doofus,\u201d you answer and lean down to crash your lips against his lovingly. He responds instantly by pulling you closer as he stands up, and grabs the ring out of the box. As much as he doesn\u2019t want to break the feeling of your lips against his, he breaks away from the kiss so he can slide the ring onto you finger.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLooks better there than it did in the box,\u201d he states, and smiles at you; basically causing you heart to absolutely melt. He leans in for another peck, before ending the quick kiss so he can mumble against your lips.\u00a0\u201cGlad to have you home, soon to-be Mrs. Styles.\u201d<br></p></p>",

Part 2 to Under the Bridge. Naturally, I had to use another Red Hot Chili Peppers song because I\u2019m destructive\u2026 ok here we go</b>. <i>(Dedicated to the ever lovely <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> for being the best hype woman as I wrote this)</i></p><p>A soft moan of contentment escapes your mouth as your eyes slowly open, and a smile graces your lips. Your eyes wander around the room, and a foreign feeling makes itself known to you; peacefulness. </p><p>The thoughts of what happened last night between you and Harry fill your mind, and you smile even wider. After the Met Gala, the two of you came back to his apartment where you both shared a relaxing bath, and began a long intimate, loving night. </p><p>All the pleasure, sexiness, and <i>love </i>of it all is fresh in your mind as the man beside you let\u2019s out a groan, and slowly opens up his enticing green eyes to look at you adoringly. </p><p>\u201cMorning sleepyhead,\u201d you greet him with a soft peck to his lips, and move to push some of his growing curls away from his face; a gesture you always do affectionately when it comes to your boyfriend of four years. \u201cWell rested I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know,\u201d he replies with a chuckle. \u201cHow about you, love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI slept great,\u201d you tell him honestly, and watch happily as his dimples make themselves known while his grin widens. \u201cIt was the best sleep I\u2019ve had in a while actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asks, and absentmindedly places a soft kiss on the back of your hand. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you state, slightly confused by his question. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re not even awake right now,\u201d he answers, while he moves to place more kisses along your exposed shoulders and collarbone. </p><p>\u201cNot awake?\u201d You ask disbelievingly. \u201cHarry, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else as his trail of kisses slowly moves up your neck, and finally speaks again once he moves away slightly so his eyes meet yours. \u201cWake up, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>With a sudden jolt, you sit upwards in your hotel room bed desperately trying to catch your breath. You place a hand on your chest in attempts to calm the rapid thumping of your heart, as you glance around and remember where you actually are. </p><p>You aren\u2019t laying in Harry\u2019s king-sized bed with him, no, you\u2019re curled up alone in the double bed of a downtown Manhattan hotel you managed to get a room in on <i>very</i> short notice. </p><p>Once you feel you\u2019ve calmed down a little bit, you reach over to the bedside table and grab your phone so you can look at the time.\u00a0A frown forms on your lips as you see the time to be 3:30am, and realize what you thought you were just experiencing was actually a sick twisted dream.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You stare at the screen a bit longer to look at the multiple notifications of missed calls and texts from Harry, and your heart pangs at the sight of the picture of the two of you that\u2019s saved as your lock screen; him looking at you lovingly as he gives you a piggyback, and you smiling ridiculously large. You felt good when Anne snapped this picture of the two of you last year at Christmas, and can\u2019t help but wonder where that feeling went.\u00a0</p><p>With a shaky breath, you set the phone back onto the table, and roll back over to try and get some more sleep\u2026 However, it\u00a0doesn\u2019t really work out that way.\u00a0</p><p>Much to your dismay, the next hour or so consists of you tossing and turning; trying to relieve yourself from the sad thoughts, but it just doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p>It isn\u2019t until you reach up to tiredly rub at your eyes that you notice the tears that formed had escaped and were streaming down your face. A small scoff-like laugh leaves your mouth as you start feeling as if your life has become that of what can be imagined when listening to the saddest Coldplay songs, and you honestly hate it.\u00a0</p><p>You reach the point of being extremely fed up with your anxious mind, and decide that maybe some fresh air will help calm you down.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re quick in throwing on a pair of tights, and the baggy sweater you grabbed when you made a quick pit stop at Harry\u2019s apartment to grab some things after leaving him at the Met Gala.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the sweater is pulled over your head, you immediately realize this sweater isn\u2019t even your\u2019s but is one Harry\u2019s. The scent of his favourite cologne overwhelms you, and you immediately want to take it off. However, you really don\u2019t have the choice seeing as these are the only pieces of warm clothing you managed to grab in your short visit to the apartment; wasting no time there out of fear Harry may have come home looking for you.\u00a0</p><p>With another quick breath, you grab your phone from the bedside table and make way down to the hotel lobby.\u00a0</p><p>The mild weather of this lovely May night would normally be appreciated by you as you wander around the fairly empty streets of New York City, but you\u2019re unable to enjoy such little things as your mind continues racing.\u00a0</p><p>Did you make a mistake? The last thing you wanted to do was hurt your boyfriend, but this is honestly something you feel that needed to be done. You can\u2019t help but think of how Harry doesn\u2019t need to be brought down by your poor thoughts about yourself, he has enough going on in his hectic life; so maybe this break <i>will</i> be beneficial to the both of you - regardless of you not being completely sold on the idea that this is truly what you want.\u00a0</p><p>For the last four years Harry has been your rock, hell even since before the two of you started dating he was always this constant person in your life.\u00a0</p><p>You met him back in 2013 during his One Direction glory days; when he was at the ripe age of nineteen. The two of you met through a mutual friend and hit it off immediately, however it wasn\u2019t until Christmastime of the following year that he finally asked you to be his girlfriend; which you gladly agreed to, despite what it entailed.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ve given up a lot during your relationship with Harry, but he\u2019s always made it worth it to you; even in the hard times.\u00a0</p><p>Over the last four years you\u2019ve received criticism from friends, family, fans of his, and the media all regarding the pairing that was you and world renown pop star Harry Styles; but he was never like that behind closed doors\u2026 He was always just, Harry, and that was the man you grew to love. The man who actually understood you, and didn\u2019t try to ignore your mental health when it was thrown in his face.\u00a0</p><p>Anxiety has always been this monster lurking in the shadows, following you wherever you go - just waiting for the most inconvenient time to make itself known. One of the worst panic attacks you\u2019ve ever experienced happened when landing in LAX less than a year into your relationship. The two of you were swarmed by fans and paparazzi once you both stepped foot into the terminal, and you quickly became over whelmed; trying your best to not cry in front of all these people as you were pushed away from your boyfriend. \u00a0</p><p>Harry on the other hand, handed everything with grace and ease. After greeting his fans in a friendly manner, he politely excused himself so he could grab ahold of your hand and allow his security team to direct the two of you away from the mayhem. The incident took a toll on you, but also Harry as he was left feeling extremely bad for what had just happened, and vowed to protect you to the best of his ability in any circumstance, always.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s been\u00a0truthful to that promise and you never had a doubt in your mind that he wouldn\u2019t be; hell, just last night was a perfect example of that with how he handled the paparazzi attacking you\u2026 And realizing that is when it really hit\u2019s you.\u00a0</p><p>Harry has not only been your rock; but is also your home. He never made you feel like you <i>needed</i> to be protected or anything of that sense, it was just his overall goal to make sure you felt safe and happy; especially when you were together - it\u2019s all he cared about.\u00a0</p><p>It was shown through the small gestures he\u2019s made over the years that barely crossed your mind. The late night back rubs, the running of baths after excruciatingly long days, his daily FaceTime calls while being\u00a0away on tour so you can be one of the first things he sees once he\u2019s awake and the last before he goes to sleep, along with everything else in between; this man revolved his world around you, and it\u2019s taken you until now to realize it. \u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t notice the tears streaming down your face for yet another time tonight, until you find yourself attempting to choke back a sob as it desperately tries to escape. Your anxiety has gotten the best of you again, and you\u2019re devastated by the thought of something you\u2019ve\u00a0decided you needed in order to feel better - only has made you feel worse about everything, and has left you feeling pretty damn lonely.\u00a0</p><p>You may have just lost the greatest thing in your life simply by pushing him away, and that thought hurts like a bitch.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ve spent the last twenty minutes so consumed by your thoughts and memories, that you didn\u2019t even realize where you were allowing your feet to take you. As you shake your head to recollect yourself, you round another corner and find yourself surrounded by the bright lights of Times Square.\u00a0</p><p>Normally you wouldn\u2019t mind this, seeing as Times Square is a very intriguing place in and of it\u2019s own; but you aren\u2019t able to enjoy it as much as you once have when almost instantly two other people standing nearby recognize you.\u00a0</p><p>First off, you\u2019re confused by why there\u2019s so many people in the square this late at night; but then again this is NYC. It\u2019s\u00a0city that never sleeps, right? Second, you\u2019re unsure of how these two were so quick in pointing you out from all the other people here as well; coming to the conclusion that maybe the word <i>Harry</i>\u00a0being stitched into your sweater above your heart might\u2019ve been the give away in that matter.\u00a0</p><p>The two girls stare at you as you smile awkwardly, and scurry on past them; trying your best to not make a comment of the pictures they are so obviously snapping on their cell phones as you go by. You make it only a few more steps before someone decides to call out after you, and internally groan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d it says, and you freeze.\u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s Harry?\u201d You close your eyes and take a breath to calm yourself from the uneasy feeling that\u2019s developing in your gut, slowly turning around to face where the voice just came from; however, you are not prepared to be met by the scene that is taking place behind you.\u00a0<br></p><p>Not only are the other\u2019s who had been in the square as well have gathered around you, but some paparazzi are here too; snapping pictures and yelling questions, leading you to believe they\u2019ve literally just popped up out of thin air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it true you and Harry broke up tonight?\u201d One of the fans question, and you move your watering eyes to face them. You try your best to find a response, but soon become overwhelmed as more and more people begin closing in on you.\u00a0<br></p><p>The all too familiar panicky feeling you felt with Harry at the Met Gala, as well as the one you felt at LAX all those years ago begins making itself known, and you start taking deep rapid breaths. You can\u2019t find it in you to respond, and that\u2019s when a hand grabs ahold of your wrist and starts pulling.\u00a0</p><p>You can\u2019t help but be alarmed by the sudden gesture. However, the person seems to be on a mission; flawlessly weaving you between members of the crowd that\u2019s formed around you, and making way towards some of the taxi\u2019s idling nearby.\u00a0</p><p>They don\u2019t release the grip they have on your arm until the two of you reach one of the cabs, and you gently yank your wrist away as they open the door to climb in one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you speak up, and sniffle; quickly glancing over your shoulder at the crowd of people following after you.\u00a0\u201cWho are you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSomeone you can trust,\u201d the person replies, and slowly turns around to look at you. Even with the hood pulled over the top of their head, and the large sunglasses on their face; you instantly recognize them as none other than one of your favourite people ever.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d you whisper to yourself in relief, but can tell she\u2019s heard you by the smile that stretches across her face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThe one and only,\u201d she smirks, and motions for you to get into the taxi.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d<br></p><p>You quickly oblige to her demands, and the cab takes off as soon as the two of you are inside. You glance at the crowd of people one last time as they appear smaller in the distance, and let out a sigh of relief before turning to look at Harry\u2019s sister.\u00a0\u201cThank you for that Gem-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d She interrupts, and rips off her sunglasses so she can glare at you.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s five o\u2019clock in the morning, and you thought it\u2019d be a good idea to walk around New York <i>alone</i>? Holy shit, Harry would loose it if he ever found it\u2026 Oh my god if something were to happen and-.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I promise,\u201d you cut her off this time, and she takes a breath.\u00a0\u201cOverwhelmed, yes, but fine.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I knew you\u2019d be ok regardless, I\u2019m talking about the not so nice people you can meet walking alone at night, Y/N,\u201d she explains, and you nod in agreement.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, not my best idea,\u201d you tell her, and she smirks.\u00a0\u201cBut- why were <i>you </i>walking\u00a0around Times Square this late?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI was with Michal,\u201d she tells you.\u00a0\u201cWe met up with Harry after the gala, and sat with him in a little pizza shop as he sulked. Dropped him off at home about twenty minutes ago, and then made way to Times Square just for fun. We were sitting on the red stairs when I saw those people crowding around you\u2026 Told Michal to head back to the hotel, and I came to grab you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMuch appreciated,\u201d you thank her with a smile.\u00a0\u201cH-how\u2019s Harry?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hurting,\u201d she explains, as you bite down on your bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cYou\u00a0wouldn\u2019t be able to tell with how hard he tried to keep it together during the gala, but when he was with us; he wasn\u2019t doing too great. He\u2019s more confused than anything, and it\u2019s all just seems to be eating him alive.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis is all my fault,\u201d you whisper, and wipe away a stray tear that broke free.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNone of this is your fault, Y/N,\u201d she states firmly.\u00a0\u201cI love my brother, and it hurts seeing him upset; but your mental health is also extremely important. If you feel a break is what needs to be done in order to help whatever it is going on, you\u2019re entitled to that. Harry understands, he just\u2026 I think he feels helpless. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to feel pain or suffer, especially when it comes to those he loves most.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure this was the right choice anymore,\u201d you mumble in response, and glance out the window.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t realize how much you actually need a person until they\u2019re gone. I feel like this could\u2019ve just been avoided if I told Harry about how I was feeling, rather than bottling it up like I always do.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not too late to tell him,\u201d she responds as the cab comes to a slow stop. You send her a confused glance before looking out the window again, and seeing you\u2019re now parked outside Harry\u2019s apartment building.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid you plan this?\u201d You ask incredulously, and snap your gaze back to her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she answers with a shrug.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t force you to talk to him, but\u00a0I\u2019m really hoping you do because I already consider you my sister. Harry deserves someone as good as you, Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>Your heart swells at her words, and you feel as if you could burst. Gemma has become one of your really good friends over the last four years, and hearing her say that has you taken back; but in the best way possible.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe you <i>are</i> enough for Harry, and maybe it\u2019s time that you realize that.\u00a0</p><p>With a small nod, and a quick goodbye to your friend; you climb out of the taxi, and make way towards the apartment complex.\u00a0</p><p>As you reach Harry\u2019s floor you can hear muffled music playing from down the hall, and know well enough that it\u2019s your melodramatic boyfriend trying to dig himself further into the pit of despair. The distinctive voice of Anthony Kiedis becomes clearer as you reach the door, and you can\u2019t help but chuckle a little bit at his choice of music. This bitch is blaring Red Hot Chili Peppers at 5:30am, and hasn\u2019t gotten a noise complaint? Shocking.\u00a0</p><p>You try your best to not get nervous as you slowly unlock the door with your key, and quietly make your way inside. Every light is off in the apartment minus the faint glow of a lamp in the bedroom that illuminates the hallway a little bit through the slightly cracked open door.\u00a0</p><p>Quietly, you pad down the hall and peak through the crack of the door to see what scene is taking place on the other side.\u00a0</p><p>Harry lays motionless at the base of the bed with his legs hanging over the edge, gently tapping his fingers against the duvet as <i>Under The Bridge </i>begins playing from his vinyl record player over in the corner of the room. He\u2019s still dressed in the suit he wore this evening to host the Met Gala, but is missing his jacket; which happens to be laying on the ground beside his foot in a wrinkled mess.\u00a0You shake your head again, and slowly push the door open so you can make your presence known.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought I was the overly dramatic one in this relationship, Styles,\u201d you greet as you lean against the doorframe, a smug grin dancing on your lips. He instantly sit\u2019s up, and looks at you as if he\u2019s seeing a ghost; completely speechless, and unsure of what to do. You pull your bottom lip in between your teeth, and awkwardly glance over to the record player as the song goes into it\u2019s chorus.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t ever want to feel like you did that day, hmm? Yeah, me neither.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he finally speaks up, and cautiously stands up from the bed; as if he\u2019s afraid you might get scared and run off again.\u00a0\u201cW-what-.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAm I doing here?\u201d You finish for him, and push yourself away from the doorway to step towards him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fixing something that should\u2019ve never been broken.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd what is that exactly?\u201d He faintly asks, but you can hear him loud and clear.\u00a0\u201cY/N, I\u2019m so sorry if I ever made you feel like you were alone in any of this. That is the last thing I wanted to happen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you tell him honestly, and come to a stop about a foot away; glancing up into his green eyes that never fail to make your breath hitch. \u201cAnd as much as I wish I could put the blame on someone else, this really isn\u2019t your fault Harry. It\u2019s my own.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo it really isn\u2019t, love,\u201d he argues, and reaches out to gently grab your hands with his; making no effort in hiding the relief that takes over his features as you don\u2019t pull away from him.\u00a0\u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling, and what you\u2019re going through is valid Y/N. <i>You</i> are valid.\u201d<br></p><p>The tears begin welling up in your eyes, and he\u2019s quick in pushing away the ones that break free with the soft pads of his thumbs; keeping his hands placed on either side of your face.\u00a0\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve been with to make me feel ok in my own skin. To not be ashamed of who I am, despite the internal battles that consume my thoughts sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bub,\u201d whispers sadly.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever talk to me about these things?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause my mind can be a scary place sometimes Harry,\u201d you explain, and exhale deeply.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s hard to share what goes on up there, but it\u2019s something I want to work on. I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to feel the way I do, and I think actually opening up about it can help a lot. There comes times where I feel like I\u2019m\u00a0being walked all over, in a lot of ways. Some have to do with you, but more have to do with me because I let it happen; and I want that to change. The things people say about us, about me\u2026 I let them get to me when I really shouldn\u2019t, which can create a lot of problems. Their opinion doesn\u2019t matter when all I care about is this incredible man that has decided to share his whirlwind of a life with someone like me. It\u2019s surreal, and I think it\u2019s time I realize that maybe I am worthy of this life. I am good enough to be overly in love with you, and have no need to not feel that way. And <i>I\u2019m </i>sorry if\u00a0I\u2019ve ever made it out to seem like I\u2019m not this special, important person that you make insanely happy\u2026 Because maybe I am. Clearly there\u2019s something about me that appeals to the amazing person you are, and it\u2019s finally time I accept that. So thank you, Harry. I-.\u201d<br></p><p>Your rant is cut short as his lips crash to yours hungrily, but oh so affectionately. It\u2019s exactly what you need in this moment, and Harry was quick in picking up on that like he always is. His arms snake around your waist so he can pull you against his chest, and deepen the kiss; all while your arms link around the back of his neck to do the same\u2026 Mentally smacking yourself for ever thinking you\u2019d ever want a break from <i>this</i>.</p><p>After a few moments, he slowly pulls away and places his forehead against yours; smiling at you cheekily, making sure to show off his dimples that makes you want to melt in his hold.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy it makes me to hear you say that,\u201d he starts, and you can feel a blush creeping across your cheeks.\u00a0\u201cBecause, you are\u2026 everything Y/N. There\u2019s no one out there as perfect for me as you are, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finally realizing that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell now you\u2019re just being cheesy,\u201d you respond jokingly, and place a soft peck to his lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou love it,\u201d he snarks, before pulling you in for a tight bear hug.\u00a0\u201cM\u2019glad to have you back, bub.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou never lost me,\u201d you tell him, and nuzzle your head into him.\u00a0\u201cYou pretty well have me wrapped around your finger at this point. I\u2019d follow you anywhere.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\u00a0I\u2019ll always want you there,\u201d he states, and places a kiss onto the top of your head.\u00a0\u201cHow about you follow me to the washroom though, hmm? I think we both deserve a relaxing bath after such a night.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I had a dream\u00a0that started off like this,\u201d you explain with a chuckle as you think back to what originally woke you up during this already long night.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d He asks, and moves away to raise an eyebrow at you.\u00a0\u201cWell I say we make it a reality then.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d you reply, and let him start leading you towards the en-suite. He steps over his suit jacket that lays in a ball on the floor, and you role your eyes at his laziness; letting go of his hand so you can grab it.\u00a0\u201cHarry this is expensive, pick up after yourself.\u201d<br></p><p>He goes to stop you, but is too late as you lift it from the ground and a small black felt box falls out of the pocket.\u00a0\u201cY/N-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d You ask, and bend down to pick it up as well. Looking it over in your hand, before glancing back to your boyfriend; who has a goofy grin on his face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d he instructs, and steps closer to you.\u00a0<br></p><p>Confused by why he\u2019s acting so strange all of a sudden, you oblige and open the box to reveal a stunning diamond ring inside of it. You scrunch your face at it slightly; unsure of why he has this, but then it clicks.\u00a0\u201cOh my god - Harry,\u201d you gasp, and place a hand over your mouth in shock.\u00a0</p><p>When you move your gaze back to him you find that he\u2019s no longer standing in front of you, but rather kneeling, and your breath gets completely caught in your throat at the sight.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to do this grand gesture to show you how badly I need you in my life Y/N, but have come to realize that we\u2019re the best at showing our love for each other through the little things,\u201d he begins, and the waterworks start all over again.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to ask you tonight at the Met\u2026 but now seems just about as good of a time as any. So, Y/N. Will you make me the happiest man on this planet by saying you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re at a loss of words at his gesture and all around love you have for him, that you just find yourself shaking your head.\u00a0\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t mind too much if you said yes,\u201d he responds in an almost pleading manner.\u00a0\u201cIf m\u2019being completely honest.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you, you doofus,\u201d you answer and lean down to crash your lips against his lovingly. He responds instantly by pulling you closer as he stands up, and grabs the ring out of the box. As much as he doesn\u2019t want to break the feeling of your lips against his, he breaks away from the kiss so he can slide the ring onto you finger.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLooks better there than it did in the box,\u201d he states, and smiles at you; basically causing you heart to absolutely melt. He leans in for another peck, before ending the quick kiss so he can mumble against your lips.\u00a0\u201cGlad to have you home, soon to-be Mrs. Styles.\u201d<br></p></p>",

Part 2 to Under the Bridge. Naturally, I had to use another Red Hot Chili Peppers song because I&rsquo;m destructive&hellip; ok here we go</b>. <i>(Dedicated to the ever lovely <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> for being the best hype woman as I wrote this)</i></p><p>A soft moan of contentment escapes your mouth as your eyes slowly open, and a smile graces your lips. Your eyes wander around the room, and a foreign feeling makes itself known to you; peacefulness. </p><p>The thoughts of what happened last night between you and Harry fill your mind, and you smile even wider. After the Met Gala, the two of you came back to his apartment where you both shared a relaxing bath, and began a long intimate, loving night. </p><p>All the pleasure, sexiness, and <i>love </i>of it all is fresh in your mind as the man beside you let&rsquo;s out a groan, and slowly opens up his enticing green eyes to look at you adoringly. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning sleepyhead,&rdquo; you greet him with a soft peck to his lips, and move to push some of his growing curls away from his face; a gesture you always do affectionately when it comes to your boyfriend of four years. &ldquo;Well rested I presume?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know,&rdquo; he replies with a chuckle. &ldquo;How about you, love?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I slept great,&rdquo; you tell him honestly, and watch happily as his dimples make themselves known while his grin widens. &ldquo;It was the best sleep I&rsquo;ve had in a while actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; He asks, and absentmindedly places a soft kiss on the back of your hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you state, slightly confused by his question. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re not even awake right now,&rdquo; he answers, while he moves to place more kisses along your exposed shoulders and collarbone. </p><p>&ldquo;Not awake?&rdquo; You ask disbelievingly. &ldquo;Harry, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t say anything else as his trail of kisses slowly moves up your neck, and finally speaks again once he moves away slightly so his eyes meet yours. &ldquo;Wake up, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>With a sudden jolt, you sit upwards in your hotel room bed desperately trying to catch your breath. You place a hand on your chest in attempts to calm the rapid thumping of your heart, as you glance around and remember where you actually are. </p><p>You aren&rsquo;t laying in Harry&rsquo;s king-sized bed with him, no, you&rsquo;re curled up alone in the double bed of a downtown Manhattan hotel you managed to get a room in on <i>very</i> short notice. </p><p>Once you feel you&rsquo;ve calmed down a little bit, you reach over to the bedside table and grab your phone so you can look at the time.&nbsp;A frown forms on your lips as you see the time to be 3:30am, and realize what you thought you were just experiencing was actually a sick twisted dream.</p><p>You stare at the screen a bit longer to look at the multiple notifications of missed calls and texts from Harry, and your heart pangs at the sight of the picture of the two of you that&rsquo;s saved as your lock screen; him looking at you lovingly as he gives you a piggyback, and you smiling ridiculously large. You felt good when Anne snapped this picture of the two of you last year at Christmas, and can&rsquo;t help but wonder where that feeling went.&nbsp;</p><p>With a shaky breath, you set the phone back onto the table, and roll back over to try and get some more sleep&hellip; However, it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t really work out that way.&nbsp;</p><p>Much to your dismay, the next hour or so consists of you tossing and turning; trying to relieve yourself from the sad thoughts, but it just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t until you reach up to tiredly rub at your eyes that you notice the tears that formed had escaped and were streaming down your face. A small scoff-like laugh leaves your mouth as you start feeling as if your life has become that of what can be imagined when listening to the saddest Coldplay songs, and you honestly hate it.&nbsp;</p><p>You reach the point of being extremely fed up with your anxious mind, and decide that maybe some fresh air will help calm you down.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;re quick in throwing on a pair of tights, and the baggy sweater you grabbed when you made a quick pit stop at Harry&rsquo;s apartment to grab some things after leaving him at the Met Gala.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as the sweater is pulled over your head, you immediately realize this sweater isn&rsquo;t even your&rsquo;s but is one Harry&rsquo;s. The scent of his favourite cologne overwhelms you, and you immediately want to take it off. However, you really don&rsquo;t have the choice seeing as these are the only pieces of warm clothing you managed to grab in your short visit to the apartment; wasting no time there out of fear Harry may have come home looking for you.&nbsp;</p><p>With another quick breath, you grab your phone from the bedside table and make way down to the hotel lobby.&nbsp;</p><p>The mild weather of this lovely May night would normally be appreciated by you as you wander around the fairly empty streets of New York City, but you&rsquo;re unable to enjoy such little things as your mind continues racing.&nbsp;</p><p>Did you make a mistake? The last thing you wanted to do was hurt your boyfriend, but this is honestly something you feel that needed to be done. You can&rsquo;t help but think of how Harry doesn&rsquo;t need to be brought down by your poor thoughts about yourself, he has enough going on in his hectic life; so maybe this break <i>will</i> be beneficial to the both of you - regardless of you not being completely sold on the idea that this is truly what you want.&nbsp;</p><p>For the last four years Harry has been your rock, hell even since before the two of you started dating he was always this constant person in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>You met him back in 2013 during his One Direction glory days; when he was at the ripe age of nineteen. The two of you met through a mutual friend and hit it off immediately, however it wasn&rsquo;t until Christmastime of the following year that he finally asked you to be his girlfriend; which you gladly agreed to, despite what it entailed.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;ve given up a lot during your relationship with Harry, but he&rsquo;s always made it worth it to you; even in the hard times.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last four years you&rsquo;ve received criticism from friends, family, fans of his, and the media all regarding the pairing that was you and world renown pop star Harry Styles; but he was never like that behind closed doors&hellip; He was always just, Harry, and that was the man you grew to love. The man who actually understood you, and didn&rsquo;t try to ignore your mental health when it was thrown in his face.&nbsp;</p><p>Anxiety has always been this monster lurking in the shadows, following you wherever you go - just waiting for the most inconvenient time to make itself known. One of the worst panic attacks you&rsquo;ve ever experienced happened when landing in LAX less than a year into your relationship. The two of you were swarmed by fans and paparazzi once you both stepped foot into the terminal, and you quickly became over whelmed; trying your best to not cry in front of all these people as you were pushed away from your boyfriend. &nbsp;</p><p>Harry on the other hand, handed everything with grace and ease. After greeting his fans in a friendly manner, he politely excused himself so he could grab ahold of your hand and allow his security team to direct the two of you away from the mayhem. The incident took a toll on you, but also Harry as he was left feeling extremely bad for what had just happened, and vowed to protect you to the best of his ability in any circumstance, always.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s been&nbsp;truthful to that promise and you never had a doubt in your mind that he wouldn&rsquo;t be; hell, just last night was a perfect example of that with how he handled the paparazzi attacking you&hellip; And realizing that is when it really hit&rsquo;s you.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry has not only been your rock; but is also your home. He never made you feel like you <i>needed</i> to be protected or anything of that sense, it was just his overall goal to make sure you felt safe and happy; especially when you were together - it&rsquo;s all he cared about.&nbsp;</p><p>It was shown through the small gestures he&rsquo;s made over the years that barely crossed your mind. The late night back rubs, the running of baths after excruciatingly long days, his daily FaceTime calls while being&nbsp;away on tour so you can be one of the first things he sees once he&rsquo;s awake and the last before he goes to sleep, along with everything else in between; this man revolved his world around you, and it&rsquo;s taken you until now to realize it. &nbsp;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t notice the tears streaming down your face for yet another time tonight, until you find yourself attempting to choke back a sob as it desperately tries to escape. Your anxiety has gotten the best of you again, and you&rsquo;re devastated by the thought of something you&rsquo;ve&nbsp;decided you needed in order to feel better - only has made you feel worse about everything, and has left you feeling pretty damn lonely.&nbsp;</p><p>You may have just lost the greatest thing in your life simply by pushing him away, and that thought hurts like a bitch.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;ve spent the last twenty minutes so consumed by your thoughts and memories, that you didn&rsquo;t even realize where you were allowing your feet to take you. As you shake your head to recollect yourself, you round another corner and find yourself surrounded by the bright lights of Times Square.&nbsp;</p><p>Normally you wouldn&rsquo;t mind this, seeing as Times Square is a very intriguing place in and of it&rsquo;s own; but you aren&rsquo;t able to enjoy it as much as you once have when almost instantly two other people standing nearby recognize you.&nbsp;</p><p>First off, you&rsquo;re confused by why there&rsquo;s so many people in the square this late at night; but then again this is NYC. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;city that never sleeps, right? Second, you&rsquo;re unsure of how these two were so quick in pointing you out from all the other people here as well; coming to the conclusion that maybe the word <i>Harry</i>&nbsp;being stitched into your sweater above your heart might&rsquo;ve been the give away in that matter.&nbsp;</p><p>The two girls stare at you as you smile awkwardly, and scurry on past them; trying your best to not make a comment of the pictures they are so obviously snapping on their cell phones as you go by. You make it only a few more steps before someone decides to call out after you, and internally groan.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; it says, and you freeze.&nbsp;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Harry?&rdquo; You close your eyes and take a breath to calm yourself from the uneasy feeling that&rsquo;s developing in your gut, slowly turning around to face where the voice just came from; however, you are not prepared to be met by the scene that is taking place behind you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Not only are the other&rsquo;s who had been in the square as well have gathered around you, but some paparazzi are here too; snapping pictures and yelling questions, leading you to believe they&rsquo;ve literally just popped up out of thin air.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it true you and Harry broke up tonight?&rdquo; One of the fans question, and you move your watering eyes to face them. You try your best to find a response, but soon become overwhelmed as more and more people begin closing in on you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The all too familiar panicky feeling you felt with Harry at the Met Gala, as well as the one you felt at LAX all those years ago begins making itself known, and you start taking deep rapid breaths. You can&rsquo;t find it in you to respond, and that&rsquo;s when a hand grabs ahold of your wrist and starts pulling.&nbsp;</p><p>You can&rsquo;t help but be alarmed by the sudden gesture. However, the person seems to be on a mission; flawlessly weaving you between members of the crowd that&rsquo;s formed around you, and making way towards some of the taxi&rsquo;s idling nearby.&nbsp;</p><p>They don&rsquo;t release the grip they have on your arm until the two of you reach one of the cabs, and you gently yank your wrist away as they open the door to climb in one of them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; you speak up, and sniffle; quickly glancing over your shoulder at the crowd of people following after you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Someone you can trust,&rdquo; the person replies, and slowly turns around to look at you. Even with the hood pulled over the top of their head, and the large sunglasses on their face; you instantly recognize them as none other than one of your favourite people ever.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gemma,&rdquo; you whisper to yourself in relief, but can tell she&rsquo;s heard you by the smile that stretches across her face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The one and only,&rdquo; she smirks, and motions for you to get into the taxi.&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s get you out of here.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You quickly oblige to her demands, and the cab takes off as soon as the two of you are inside. You glance at the crowd of people one last time as they appear smaller in the distance, and let out a sigh of relief before turning to look at Harry&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you for that Gem-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo; She interrupts, and rips off her sunglasses so she can glare at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and you thought it&rsquo;d be a good idea to walk around New York <i>alone</i>? Holy shit, Harry would loose it if he ever found it&hellip; Oh my god if something were to happen and-.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I promise,&rdquo; you cut her off this time, and she takes a breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;Overwhelmed, yes, but fine.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I knew you&rsquo;d be ok regardless, I&rsquo;m talking about the not so nice people you can meet walking alone at night, Y/N,&rdquo; she explains, and you nod in agreement.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, not my best idea,&rdquo; you tell her, and she smirks.&nbsp;&ldquo;But- why were <i>you </i>walking&nbsp;around Times Square this late?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was with Michal,&rdquo; she tells you.&nbsp;&ldquo;We met up with Harry after the gala, and sat with him in a little pizza shop as he sulked. Dropped him off at home about twenty minutes ago, and then made way to Times Square just for fun. We were sitting on the red stairs when I saw those people crowding around you&hellip; Told Michal to head back to the hotel, and I came to grab you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Much appreciated,&rdquo; you thank her with a smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;H-how&rsquo;s Harry?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurting,&rdquo; she explains, as you bite down on your bottom lip.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell with how hard he tried to keep it together during the gala, but when he was with us; he wasn&rsquo;t doing too great. He&rsquo;s more confused than anything, and it&rsquo;s all just seems to be eating him alive.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This is all my fault,&rdquo; you whisper, and wipe away a stray tear that broke free.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;None of this is your fault, Y/N,&rdquo; she states firmly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love my brother, and it hurts seeing him upset; but your mental health is also extremely important. If you feel a break is what needs to be done in order to help whatever it is going on, you&rsquo;re entitled to that. Harry understands, he just&hellip; I think he feels helpless. He doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to feel pain or suffer, especially when it comes to those he loves most.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure this was the right choice anymore,&rdquo; you mumble in response, and glance out the window.&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t realize how much you actually need a person until they&rsquo;re gone. I feel like this could&rsquo;ve just been avoided if I told Harry about how I was feeling, rather than bottling it up like I always do.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s not too late to tell him,&rdquo; she responds as the cab comes to a slow stop. You send her a confused glance before looking out the window again, and seeing you&rsquo;re now parked outside Harry&rsquo;s apartment building.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you plan this?&rdquo; You ask incredulously, and snap your gaze back to her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; she answers with a shrug.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t force you to talk to him, but&nbsp;I&rsquo;m really hoping you do because I already consider you my sister. Harry deserves someone as good as you, Y/N.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Your heart swells at her words, and you feel as if you could burst. Gemma has become one of your really good friends over the last four years, and hearing her say that has you taken back; but in the best way possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you <i>are</i> enough for Harry, and maybe it&rsquo;s time that you realize that.&nbsp;</p><p>With a small nod, and a quick goodbye to your friend; you climb out of the taxi, and make way towards the apartment complex.&nbsp;</p><p>As you reach Harry&rsquo;s floor you can hear muffled music playing from down the hall, and know well enough that it&rsquo;s your melodramatic boyfriend trying to dig himself further into the pit of despair. The distinctive voice of Anthony Kiedis becomes clearer as you reach the door, and you can&rsquo;t help but chuckle a little bit at his choice of music. This bitch is blaring Red Hot Chili Peppers at 5:30am, and hasn&rsquo;t gotten a noise complaint? Shocking.&nbsp;</p><p>You try your best to not get nervous as you slowly unlock the door with your key, and quietly make your way inside. Every light is off in the apartment minus the faint glow of a lamp in the bedroom that illuminates the hallway a little bit through the slightly cracked open door.&nbsp;</p><p>Quietly, you pad down the hall and peak through the crack of the door to see what scene is taking place on the other side.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry lays motionless at the base of the bed with his legs hanging over the edge, gently tapping his fingers against the duvet as <i>Under The Bridge </i>begins playing from his vinyl record player over in the corner of the room. He&rsquo;s still dressed in the suit he wore this evening to host the Met Gala, but is missing his jacket; which happens to be laying on the ground beside his foot in a wrinkled mess.&nbsp;You shake your head again, and slowly push the door open so you can make your presence known.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I was the overly dramatic one in this relationship, Styles,&rdquo; you greet as you lean against the doorframe, a smug grin dancing on your lips. He instantly sit&rsquo;s up, and looks at you as if he&rsquo;s seeing a ghost; completely speechless, and unsure of what to do. You pull your bottom lip in between your teeth, and awkwardly glance over to the record player as the song goes into it&rsquo;s chorus.&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ever want to feel like you did that day, hmm? Yeah, me neither.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he finally speaks up, and cautiously stands up from the bed; as if he&rsquo;s afraid you might get scared and run off again.&nbsp;&ldquo;W-what-.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Am I doing here?&rdquo; You finish for him, and push yourself away from the doorway to step towards him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fixing something that should&rsquo;ve never been broken.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And what is that exactly?&rdquo; He faintly asks, but you can hear him loud and clear.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m so sorry if I ever made you feel like you were alone in any of this. That is the last thing I wanted to happen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; you tell him honestly, and come to a stop about a foot away; glancing up into his green eyes that never fail to make your breath hitch. &ldquo;And as much as I wish I could put the blame on someone else, this really isn&rsquo;t your fault Harry. It&rsquo;s my own.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No it really isn&rsquo;t, love,&rdquo; he argues, and reaches out to gently grab your hands with his; making no effort in hiding the relief that takes over his features as you don&rsquo;t pull away from him.&nbsp;&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re feeling, and what you&rsquo;re going through is valid Y/N. <i>You</i> are valid.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The tears begin welling up in your eyes, and he&rsquo;s quick in pushing away the ones that break free with the soft pads of his thumbs; keeping his hands placed on either side of your face.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re the only person I&rsquo;ve been with to make me feel ok in my own skin. To not be ashamed of who I am, despite the internal battles that consume my thoughts sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, bub,&rdquo; whispers sadly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ever talk to me about these things?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because my mind can be a scary place sometimes Harry,&rdquo; you explain, and exhale deeply.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to share what goes on up there, but it&rsquo;s something I want to work on. I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to feel the way I do, and I think actually opening up about it can help a lot. There comes times where I feel like I&rsquo;m&nbsp;being walked all over, in a lot of ways. Some have to do with you, but more have to do with me because I let it happen; and I want that to change. The things people say about us, about me&hellip; I let them get to me when I really shouldn&rsquo;t, which can create a lot of problems. Their opinion doesn&rsquo;t matter when all I care about is this incredible man that has decided to share his whirlwind of a life with someone like me. It&rsquo;s surreal, and I think it&rsquo;s time I realize that maybe I am worthy of this life. I am good enough to be overly in love with you, and have no need to not feel that way. And <i>I&rsquo;m </i>sorry if&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve ever made it out to seem like I&rsquo;m not this special, important person that you make insanely happy&hellip; Because maybe I am. Clearly there&rsquo;s something about me that appeals to the amazing person you are, and it&rsquo;s finally time I accept that. So thank you, Harry. I-.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Your rant is cut short as his lips crash to yours hungrily, but oh so affectionately. It&rsquo;s exactly what you need in this moment, and Harry was quick in picking up on that like he always is. His arms snake around your waist so he can pull you against his chest, and deepen the kiss; all while your arms link around the back of his neck to do the same&hellip; Mentally smacking yourself for ever thinking you&rsquo;d ever want a break from <i>this</i>.</p><p>After a few moments, he slowly pulls away and places his forehead against yours; smiling at you cheekily, making sure to show off his dimples that makes you want to melt in his hold.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea how happy it makes me to hear you say that,&rdquo; he starts, and you can feel a blush creeping across your cheeks.&nbsp;&ldquo;Because, you are&hellip; everything Y/N. There&rsquo;s no one out there as perfect for me as you are, and I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re finally realizing that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well now you&rsquo;re just being cheesy,&rdquo; you respond jokingly, and place a soft peck to his lips.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You love it,&rdquo; he snarks, before pulling you in for a tight bear hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;M&rsquo;glad to have you back, bub.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You never lost me,&rdquo; you tell him, and nuzzle your head into him.&nbsp;&ldquo;You pretty well have me wrapped around your finger at this point. I&rsquo;d follow you anywhere.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll always want you there,&rdquo; he states, and places a kiss onto the top of your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;How about you follow me to the washroom though, hmm? I think we both deserve a relaxing bath after such a night.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oddly enough, I had a dream&nbsp;that started off like this,&rdquo; you explain with a chuckle as you think back to what originally woke you up during this already long night.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you now?&rdquo; He asks, and moves away to raise an eyebrow at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well I say we make it a reality then.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t agree more,&rdquo; you reply, and let him start leading you towards the en-suite. He steps over his suit jacket that lays in a ball on the floor, and you role your eyes at his laziness; letting go of his hand so you can grab it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Harry this is expensive, pick up after yourself.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He goes to stop you, but is too late as you lift it from the ground and a small black felt box falls out of the pocket.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; You ask, and bend down to pick it up as well. Looking it over in your hand, before glancing back to your boyfriend; who has a goofy grin on his face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; he instructs, and steps closer to you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Confused by why he&rsquo;s acting so strange all of a sudden, you oblige and open the box to reveal a stunning diamond ring inside of it. You scrunch your face at it slightly; unsure of why he has this, but then it clicks.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my god - Harry,&rdquo; you gasp, and place a hand over your mouth in shock.&nbsp;</p><p>When you move your gaze back to him you find that he&rsquo;s no longer standing in front of you, but rather kneeling, and your breath gets completely caught in your throat at the sight.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted to do this grand gesture to show you how badly I need you in my life Y/N, but have come to realize that we&rsquo;re the best at showing our love for each other through the little things,&rdquo; he begins, and the waterworks start all over again.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted to ask you tonight at the Met&hellip; but now seems just about as good of a time as any. So, Y/N. Will you make me the happiest man on this planet by saying you&rsquo;ll marry me?&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re at a loss of words at his gesture and all around love you have for him, that you just find yourself shaking your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I wouldn&rsquo;t mind too much if you said yes,&rdquo; he responds in an almost pleading manner.&nbsp;&ldquo;If m&rsquo;being completely honest.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll marry you, you doofus,&rdquo; you answer and lean down to crash your lips against his lovingly. He responds instantly by pulling you closer as he stands up, and grabs the ring out of the box. As much as he doesn&rsquo;t want to break the feeling of your lips against his, he breaks away from the kiss so he can slide the ring onto you finger.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Looks better there than it did in the box,&rdquo; he states, and smiles at you; basically causing you heart to absolutely melt. He leans in for another peck, before ending the quick kiss so he can mumble against your lips.&nbsp;&ldquo;Glad to have you home, soon to-be Mrs. Styles.&rdquo;<br /></p></p>",

Your eyes wander around the room, and a foreign feeling makes itself known to you; peacefulness. </p>\n<p>The thoughts of what happened last night between you and Harry fill your mind, and you smile even wider. After the Met Gala, the two of you came back to his apartment where you both shared a relaxing bath, and began a long intimate, loving night. </p>\n<p>All the pleasure, sexiness, and <i>love </i>of it all is fresh in your mind as the man beside you let&rsquo;s out a groan, and slowly opens up his enticing green eyes to look at you adoringly. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Morning sleepyhead,&rdquo; you greet him with a soft peck to his lips, and move to push some of his growing curls away from his face; a gesture you always do affectionately when it comes to your boyfriend of four years. &ldquo;Well rested I presume?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know,&rdquo; he replies with a chuckle. &ldquo;How about you, love?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I slept great,&rdquo; you tell him honestly, and watch happily as his dimples make themselves known while his grin widens. &ldquo;It was the best sleep I&rsquo;ve had in a while actually.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; He asks, and absentmindedly places a soft kiss on the back of your hand. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you state, slightly confused by his question. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re not even awake right now,&rdquo; he answers, while he moves to place more kisses along your exposed shoulders and collarbone. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not awake?&rdquo; You ask disbelievingly. &ldquo;Harry, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He doesn&rsquo;t say anything else as his trail of kisses slowly moves up your neck, and finally speaks again once he moves away slightly so his eyes meet yours. &ldquo;Wake up, Y/N.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With a sudden jolt, you sit upwards in your hotel room bed desperately trying to catch your breath. You place a hand on your chest in attempts to calm the rapid thumping of your heart, as you glance around and remember where you actually are. </p>\n<p>You aren&rsquo;t laying in Harry&rsquo;s king-sized bed with him, no, you&rsquo;re curled up alone in the double bed of a downtown Manhattan hotel you managed to get a room in on <i>very</i> short notice. </p>\n<p>Once you feel you&rsquo;ve calmed down a little bit, you reach over to the bedside table and grab your phone so you can look at the time.&nbsp;A frown forms on your lips as you see the time to be 3:30am, and realize what you thought you were just experiencing was actually a sick twisted dream.</p>\n</p>",
