        "body": "<h1>The True Fury Of A Mama Bear</h1><p>It was an itch he couldn&rsquo;t scratch.</p><p>His spider senses had been going off all week and it was making him restless. He taps his pen against his desk and his leg bounces as he constantly looks up from his notes and around the classroom in a paranoid frenzy. He had to calm down. It could be something as stupid as paparazzi. Except being adopted by Tony Stark&ndash;and of course Doctor Strange&ndash;after Aunt May&rsquo;s passing was old news, and they never made him this on edge.</p><p>Ned leans over when the teacher turns their back and whispers, &ldquo;Dude. What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I feel like I&rsquo;m being watched.&rdquo;</p><p>They duck their heads when the teacher turns back to the class and the conversation is put on hold until after class when the two meet at Peter&rsquo;s locker.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you told Mr.Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Europe until Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh right. What about Dr. Strange?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter winces as he closes his locker. &ldquo;If I do that, I&rsquo;m convinced he&rsquo;ll wrap me in bubble wrap and lock me in my room.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned coughs to hide a laugh. &ldquo;How long have you been feeling like this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;since Dad left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A few days?! Not a few hours?! Peter you need to tell someone!&rdquo; His best friend gives him a worried look and Peter waves him off.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably nothing. Flash has set it off before.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned looks at him skeptically but nods and they part ways after their handshake. As he leaves through the doors, Peter puts his earphones in and starts his walk to the subway. Happy usually picked him up after school, but he had taken the day off and he wasn&rsquo;t about to let Stephen portal him home. That would just draw more attention to him that he didn&rsquo;t want, especially since the news of his adoption was finally starting to lose its appeal.</p><p>Pepper was doing a great job of keeping the media away. Sure, they got a little too brave one time and were waiting outside the school, so the teen had to wait inside until Happy and Tony cleared a path. One journalist got too brave and too close to Peter and was quickly corrected by Tony&rsquo;s fist.</p><p>Both Pepper and Stephen weren&rsquo;t very happy about that little stunt. The sorcerer was quicker to forgive though.</p><p>Halfway to the subway, Peter freezes when his senses dial up to eleven and he looks behind him when the feeling of being watched screams at him. He saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>He turns to continue his trek to the subway when he suddenly feels a sudden jab in his neck, and a bag was thrown over his head. Oblivion took him before he could even think to fight back.</p><p>Or press his panic button.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Stephen frowns and checks his phone. Peter wasn&rsquo;t home yet and he didn&rsquo;t get any kind of message from him to inform the sorcerer of any last minute plans. No going home with Ned, no Decathlon meeting, no after school patrol&hellip;hell, no detention. An hour was too long for him to pick up a sandwich from Mr. Delmar as well.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;According to the tracker in his watch, he is approximately two blocks from the subway. He hasn&rsquo;t moved for 28 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t worrying at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Call him.&rdquo;</p><p>A few moments pass. &ldquo;No answer Doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should I notify the boss?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Not yet. Check surveillance feed for Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, he hoped he would be able to find a strand of Peter&rsquo;s hair. It was likely the only chance he had of finding the teen if FRIDAY didn&rsquo;t find anything on cameras.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Peter woke feeling sluggish. Once he was aware enough and took in his surroundings, he realized he was chained to a chair bolted to the floor. He could easily break the chains, but whatever he was drugged with left him so weak he could barely hold his head up. So he took in whatever surroundings he could. Not that there was anything to see, he seemed to be in the basement of a large building and it was freezing. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if the temperature was intentional or not.</p><p>The door across from him swings open and slams against the wall, causing Peter to grimace from the noise. His hearing was still dialed to eleven and the rebounding door only added to the pounding headache he had. One of his captors probably hit him over the head for good measure. Bastards.</p><p>&ldquo;So Baby Stark is awake. I&rsquo;m kind of surprised. I thought you&rsquo;d be out for a couple more hours.&rdquo; A man strolls in with two others who stay by the door.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I say? I&rsquo;m an overachiever.&rdquo; Peter responds dryly.</p><p>That was apparently the wrong thing to say because his head suddenly snapped to the side when the man&rsquo;s fist connects with the opposite cheek. If the teen had a headache before, it was a full blown migraine now.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to do that kid. We just want some of Daddy&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter glares up at him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh we know kid. Now he can&rsquo;t come rescue you. He'll\u00a0have to\u00a0pay for your safe return.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bites his lip to hide a smile. They had no idea about Stephen and were probably too stupid to think about the rest of the Avengers. Doctor Strange was scary enough.

            "comment": "<p><h1>The True Fury Of A Mama Bear</h1><p>It was an itch he couldn\u2019t scratch.</p><p>His spider senses had been going off all week and it was making him restless. He taps his pen against his desk and his leg bounces as he constantly looks up from his notes and around the classroom in a paranoid frenzy. He had to calm down. It could be something as stupid as paparazzi. Except being adopted by Tony Stark\u2013and of course Doctor Strange\u2013after Aunt May\u2019s passing was old news, and they never made him this on edge.</p><p>Ned leans over when the teacher turns their back and whispers, \u201cDude. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026I feel like I\u2019m being watched.\u201d</p><p>They duck their heads when the teacher turns back to the class and the conversation is put on hold until after class when the two meet at Peter\u2019s locker.</p><p>\u201cHave you told Mr.Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Europe until Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right. What about Dr. Strange?\u201d</p><p>Peter winces as he closes his locker. \u201cIf I do that, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019ll wrap me in bubble wrap and lock me in my room.\u201d</p><p>Ned coughs to hide a laugh. \u201cHow long have you been feeling like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026since Dad left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days?! Not a few hours?! Peter you need to tell someone!\u201d His best friend gives him a worried look and Peter waves him off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing. Flash has set it off before.\u201d</p><p>Ned looks at him skeptically but nods and they part ways after their handshake. As he leaves through the doors, Peter puts his earphones in and starts his walk to the subway. Happy usually picked him up after school, but he had taken the day off and he wasn\u2019t about to let Stephen portal him home. That would just draw more attention to him that he didn\u2019t want, especially since the news of his adoption was finally starting to lose its appeal.</p><p>Pepper was doing a great job of keeping the media away. Sure, they got a little too brave one time and were waiting outside the school, so the teen had to wait inside until Happy and Tony cleared a path. One journalist got too brave and too close to Peter and was quickly corrected by Tony\u2019s fist.</p><p>Both Pepper and Stephen weren\u2019t very happy about that little stunt. The sorcerer was quicker to forgive though.</p><p>Halfway to the subway, Peter freezes when his senses dial up to eleven and he looks behind him when the feeling of being watched screams at him. He saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>He turns to continue his trek to the subway when he suddenly feels a sudden jab in his neck, and a bag was thrown over his head. Oblivion took him before he could even think to fight back.</p><p>Or press his panic button.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Stephen frowns and checks his phone. Peter wasn\u2019t home yet and he didn\u2019t get any kind of message from him to inform the sorcerer of any last minute plans. No going home with Ned, no Decathlon meeting, no after school patrol\u2026hell, no detention. An hour was too long for him to pick up a sandwich from Mr. Delmar as well.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, where\u2019s Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the tracker in his watch, he is approximately two blocks from the subway. He hasn\u2019t moved for 28 minutes.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t worrying at all.</p><p>\u201cCall him.\u201d</p><p>A few moments pass. \u201cNo answer Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I notify the boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet. Check surveillance feed for Peter.\u201d</p><p>In the meantime, he hoped he would be able to find a strand of Peter\u2019s hair. It was likely the only chance he had of finding the teen if FRIDAY didn\u2019t find anything on cameras.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Peter woke feeling sluggish. Once he was aware enough and took in his surroundings, he realized he was chained to a chair bolted to the floor. He could easily break the chains, but whatever he was drugged with left him so weak he could barely hold his head up. So he took in whatever surroundings he could. Not that there was anything to see, he seemed to be in the basement of a large building and it was freezing. He wasn\u2019t sure if the temperature was intentional or not.</p><p>The door across from him swings open and slams against the wall, causing Peter to grimace from the noise. His hearing was still dialed to eleven and the rebounding door only added to the pounding headache he had. One of his captors probably hit him over the head for good measure. Bastards.</p><p>\u201cSo Baby Stark is awake. I\u2019m kind of surprised. I thought you\u2019d be out for a couple more hours.\u201d A man strolls in with two others who stay by the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m an overachiever.\u201d Peter responds dryly.</p><p>That was apparently the wrong thing to say because his head suddenly snapped to the side when the man\u2019s fist connects with the opposite cheek. If the teen had a headache before, it was a full blown migraine now.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do that kid. We just want some of Daddy\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>Peter glares up at him. \u201cHe\u2019s out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh we know kid. Now he can\u2019t come rescue you. He'll\u00a0have to\u00a0pay for your safe return.\u201d</p><p>Peter bites his lip to hide a smile. They had no idea about Stephen and were probably too stupid to think about the rest of the Avengers. Doctor Strange was scary enough. He no doubt knew Peter was missing by now and was likely scrambling to find a strand of his hair, and having FRIDAY track him. He noticed the absence of his watch shortly after waking so he was hoping his kidnappers would make the mistake of sending a picture or video feed to Tony. That would be all the sorcerer supreme would need.</p><p>Sure enough, one of the guy\u2019s lackies pulls out his phone and holds it up in the teen\u2019s direction after dialing.</p><p>\u201cStark.\u201d Tony answers after a few rings.</p><p>The lead man takes the phone and moves it closer to Peter. \u201cMr. Stark. I have something of yours.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up at the small screen with a bored expression and finds an annoyed one on Tony\u2019s face. Annoyance he knew was not directed at him but rather the morons who were actually moronic enough to kidnap his son. The genius takes in his son\u2019s physical health before sighing heavily.</p><p>\u201cReal fucking original. You okay kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust waiting for you to forward the picture to Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done. Sit tight.\u201d</p><p>The man holding the phone looks back at his lackies with confusion and it filled Peter with glee.

                "content": "<p><h1>The True Fury Of A Mama Bear</h1><p>It was an itch he couldn&rsquo;t scratch.</p><p>His spider senses had been going off all week and it was making him restless. He taps his pen against his desk and his leg bounces as he constantly looks up from his notes and around the classroom in a paranoid frenzy. He had to calm down. It could be something as stupid as paparazzi. Except being adopted by Tony Stark&ndash;and of course Doctor Strange&ndash;after Aunt May&rsquo;s passing was old news, and they never made him this on edge.</p><p>Ned leans over when the teacher turns their back and whispers, &ldquo;Dude. What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I feel like I&rsquo;m being watched.&rdquo;</p><p>They duck their heads when the teacher turns back to the class and the conversation is put on hold until after class when the two meet at Peter&rsquo;s locker.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you told Mr.Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Europe until Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh right. What about Dr. Strange?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter winces as he closes his locker. &ldquo;If I do that, I&rsquo;m convinced he&rsquo;ll wrap me in bubble wrap and lock me in my room.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned coughs to hide a laugh. &ldquo;How long have you been feeling like this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;since Dad left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A few days?! Not a few hours?! Peter you need to tell someone!&rdquo; His best friend gives him a worried look and Peter waves him off.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably nothing. Flash has set it off before.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned looks at him skeptically but nods and they part ways after their handshake. As he leaves through the doors, Peter puts his earphones in and starts his walk to the subway. Happy usually picked him up after school, but he had taken the day off and he wasn&rsquo;t about to let Stephen portal him home. That would just draw more attention to him that he didn&rsquo;t want, especially since the news of his adoption was finally starting to lose its appeal.</p><p>Pepper was doing a great job of keeping the media away. Sure, they got a little too brave one time and were waiting outside the school, so the teen had to wait inside until Happy and Tony cleared a path. One journalist got too brave and too close to Peter and was quickly corrected by Tony&rsquo;s fist.</p><p>Both Pepper and Stephen weren&rsquo;t very happy about that little stunt. The sorcerer was quicker to forgive though.</p><p>Halfway to the subway, Peter freezes when his senses dial up to eleven and he looks behind him when the feeling of being watched screams at him. He saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>He turns to continue his trek to the subway when he suddenly feels a sudden jab in his neck, and a bag was thrown over his head. Oblivion took him before he could even think to fight back.</p><p>Or press his panic button.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Stephen frowns and checks his phone. Peter wasn&rsquo;t home yet and he didn&rsquo;t get any kind of message from him to inform the sorcerer of any last minute plans. No going home with Ned, no Decathlon meeting, no after school patrol&hellip;hell, no detention. An hour was too long for him to pick up a sandwich from Mr. Delmar as well.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;According to the tracker in his watch, he is approximately two blocks from the subway. He hasn&rsquo;t moved for 28 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t worrying at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Call him.&rdquo;</p><p>A few moments pass. &ldquo;No answer Doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should I notify the boss?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Not yet. Check surveillance feed for Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, he hoped he would be able to find a strand of Peter&rsquo;s hair. It was likely the only chance he had of finding the teen if FRIDAY didn&rsquo;t find anything on cameras.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Peter woke feeling sluggish. Once he was aware enough and took in his surroundings, he realized he was chained to a chair bolted to the floor. He could easily break the chains, but whatever he was drugged with left him so weak he could barely hold his head up. So he took in whatever surroundings he could. Not that there was anything to see, he seemed to be in the basement of a large building and it was freezing. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if the temperature was intentional or not.</p><p>The door across from him swings open and slams against the wall, causing Peter to grimace from the noise. His hearing was still dialed to eleven and the rebounding door only added to the pounding headache he had. One of his captors probably hit him over the head for good measure. Bastards.</p><p>&ldquo;So Baby Stark is awake. I&rsquo;m kind of surprised. I thought you&rsquo;d be out for a couple more hours.&rdquo; A man strolls in with two others who stay by the door.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I say? I&rsquo;m an overachiever.&rdquo; Peter responds dryly.</p><p>That was apparently the wrong thing to say because his head suddenly snapped to the side when the man&rsquo;s fist connects with the opposite cheek. If the teen had a headache before, it was a full blown migraine now.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to do that kid. We just want some of Daddy&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter glares up at him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh we know kid. Now he can&rsquo;t come rescue you. He'll&nbsp;have to&nbsp;pay for your safe return.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bites his lip to hide a smile. They had no idea about Stephen and were probably too stupid to think about the rest of the Avengers. Doctor Strange was scary enough. He no doubt knew Peter was missing by now and was likely scrambling to find a strand of his hair, and having FRIDAY track him. He noticed the absence of his watch shortly after waking so he was hoping his kidnappers would make the mistake of sending a picture or video feed to Tony. That would be all the sorcerer supreme would need.</p><p>Sure enough, one of the guy&rsquo;s lackies pulls out his phone and holds it up in the teen&rsquo;s direction after dialing.</p><p>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Tony answers after a few rings.</p><p>The lead man takes the phone and moves it closer to Peter. &ldquo;Mr. Stark. I have something of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks up at the small screen with a bored expression and finds an annoyed one on Tony&rsquo;s face. Annoyance he knew was not directed at him but rather the morons who were actually moronic enough to kidnap his son. The genius takes in his son&rsquo;s physical health before sighing heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;Real fucking original. You okay kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just waiting for you to forward the picture to Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Already done. Sit tight.&rdquo;</p><p>The man holding the phone looks back at his lackies with confusion and it filled Peter with glee. Mama Bear was coming and they had no idea what they were in for.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said Stark wasn&rsquo;t married!&rdquo;</p><p>One of the lackies cowers under his bosses glare. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p><p>As if on cue, gold sparks flicker in the room before forming into a circle and Peter&rsquo;s captors take a bewildered step back.

I got a text from my boyfriend Peter.</p><p>&lsquo;Hey is it ok if I come over? We need to talk&rsquo;</p><p>My stomach dropped and I dropped my pen to turn all my attention to my phone.</p><p>&lsquo;Yeah&hellip; come on over.&rsquo;</p><p>*Peters POV*</p><p>I hung my head as I walked to y/ns apartment. </p><p>I had to do this, orders from Tony. I wanted to lie to him and just keep our relationship secret, but he would find out somehow, it&rsquo;s just how he was.</p><p>I felt so bad. I truly am in love with Y/n and I don&rsquo;t want to break her heart, but I HAVE TO DO THIS.</p><p>When I got to her apartment, I knocked on the door and she immediately opened it, letting me come inside. </p><p>As I walked in, I avoided all eye contact.</p><p>I needed to do this quick, so it would hurt less, but there was no doubt that it would kill me. This is killing me.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; She asked me as she closed the front door.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n I think we need to break up.&rdquo; I said quickly, turning around to face her and I looked up at her. Her eyes were already tearing up and her hands shaking. </p><p>Shit.</p><p>&ldquo;Wh-What did I do?&rdquo; She asked, a tear slipping down her cheek.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what came over me but this was hurting me so much I just wanted to tell her and get out of there before she saw me crying.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you anymore.&rdquo; I tell her as I feel my own lip quivering, so I bite it to stop it.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She sobs as she falls to the floor, tears now flowing down her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Goodbye.&rdquo; I shake my head and feel a tear sliding down my own.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it the Stark Internship? Is it something I did? Peter please tell me what I did wrong?&rdquo; She cried as I walked up to her.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything. I just moved on. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; I felt myself about to break. Sob. I had to leave.</p><p>I opened the front door and begin walking out when her voice stopped me.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you loved me. You told me you did. What happened to that Peter?&rdquo; She said standing up from the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me y/n. I do love you. Nothing will ever change that. I only want you. But this can&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo; I tell her, closing the door, leaning against it.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not? What about the times we had together? The memories?&rdquo; She tells me, making herself cry harder, and me too.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, I don&rsquo;t want you to go&hellip;&rdquo; She tells me, reaching out for my arm.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; I tell her and pull my arm away, opening the door again.</p><p>I closed the door behind me and hear her muffled cries as I walked away.</p></p>",

When he finished recounting the details, Y/N blushed profusely. </p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve kind of been cut off from people for a while, I wasn\u2019t even allowed internet back home.\u201d She mumbled, brushing a stand of hair behind her ear nervously.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Shuri patted her arm. \u201cI guess when you said it, it made us realize how stupid we are.\u201d</p><p>Peter got up and grabbed a bag of gushers, passing some to the two girls. Y/N looked at them, face wrinkled in confusion. She poked one slowly, before putting it in her mouth, when she saw the other two start inhaling them.</p><p>As Peter watched her face light up in delight, he wondered how anyone could find this girl dangerous.</p><p>\u201cThis is the man who killed her mother from a drunk driving accident.\u201d Happy explained, passing the other adults a mugshot. \u201cThis is him after Y/N found out.\u201d</p><p>He then passed around a stack of crime scene photos. Each of his limbs had been teared from his body, strewn about the street. His head, what was left of it anyway, was perched atop the convenience store had walked out of. The rest of the scene was equally as morbid and, after only a quick glance, the photos were turned over.</p><p>\u201cHow,\u201d Sam paused, swallowing. \u201cHow old was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand, how can anything be funny if it\u2019s only seven seconds?\u201d</p><p>Shuri clicked on the Vine compilation and Peter leaned over to whisper in Y/N ear.</p><p>\u201cJust trust us, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, how did you figure out it was her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there was video footage from the store but it was corrupted, it took JARVIS a whole year just to fix it. What we saw, I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone watched, frozen in shock, as the old footage played. Had Thanos even ever been able to do that?</p><p>\u201cOkay and this&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows what a toaster is, Peter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d Peter held his hands up in defense.</p><p>\u201cI know what a toaster is.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t stay here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you wanna be the one to tell her? Cause after that video there is no way in Hell I\u2019d even think it near her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Happy do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, her dad just died! Maybe not the best time to make her mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we\u2019ll see how she\u2019s doing, maybe we could help her control her powers. We\u2019re the Avengers, for god\u2019s sake, isn\u2019t this part of our jobs.\u201d</p><p>The group exited the briefing room, ready to check on the kids to make sure Y/N hadn\u2019t killed them in a violent rage.</p><p>\u201cOkay, next one.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice drifted into the room. \u201cRoad work ahead?\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence and then&hellip; a new voice.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I sure hope it does?\u201d</p><p>The group of kids began cheering and laughing.

        "answer": "<p>Warnings: Peter is 15 in this. He gets hurt. A lot. Mentally physically and sexually. All the ways. Please don\u2019t read this if that could hurt you. </p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Peter sobs and curls up as the van stops. He doesn\u2019t know what they drugged him with, but it\u2019s enough to stop Spider-Man. It must be bad. He\u2019s pulled out of the van and slapped again, then dragged into a place where they feel comfortable enough to take his blindfold off. </p><p>He whimpers as they shove him against a wall. They turn on a hose and cold water showers over him. They strip his clothes, and wash him <i>everywhere</i>. He hates it. He hates this. </p><p>They put a new blindfold on him and shove him back into the van. Now he\u2019s cold, naked, and bruised everywhere. </p><p>He sobs until he passes out. </p><p>~</p><p>When he next wakes, he\u2019s on the floor of what looks like a hospital. It can\u2019t be though; it isn\u2019t white. It\u2019s all dark. </p><p>A man comes in and picks Peter up by the hair and shoves him on the bed. The first thing he does is shove a needle into Peter\u2019s neck. Peter sobs but doesn\u2019t fight back. It must be more of whatever the drug is. </p><p>Next, he ties Peter\u2019s hands behind his back, and then he moves to Peter\u2019s butt. </p><p>Peter has never been touched there, but he can\u2019t do anything but drool into the gag as he\u2019s started to get fingered. </p><p>Peter passes out before the third finger. </p><p>~</p><p>When Peter is woken again, they give him two cups. One has a pill in it, and the other water. They force him to swallow down both. </p><p>Peter sobs and leans into the woman who starts to groom him. She brushes his hair, shaved his face. Then she waxed his chest, stomach, armpits, legs&hellip; then his pubic hair and his asshole. It hurts so fucking much, but the woman soothes him and rubs lotion everywhere it hurts. </p><p>Peter walls asleep again. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes this time, the lady he\u2019s started to not hate forces him to drink some water, and then carefully pushes the needle in again. He whimpers in pain and she soothes him again. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Peter. It\u2019ll all be alright soon.\u201d She says over and over. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t believe her. </p><p>~</p><p>And hour after she left, he\u2019s lead out of his room and into a new one. He is on what could be interpreted as a stage, and and told to stand still. It isn\u2019t like he could leave if he wanted to. </p><p>Suddenly the lights come on and he pales. He is on a stage. In front of hundreds of people. </p><p>\u201cThis one is very special, and we\u2019ve saved him for last. This here is Spider-Man! Not only is he a hero, he\u2019s also a hero who heals super quickly.\u201d</p><p>The lady he likes pulls out a knife and sliced his cheek. He whimpers and she shushes him. The crowd applauses as he heals fully. </p><p>\u201cWe will start the bidding at $1,000,000.\u201d Peter feels dazed as people bid on him. He feels like he might die when the person who buys him pays one billion USD. Just for Peter. Oh god, Peter is going to die!</p><p>\u201c$1,000,000,000 in the back! Congratulations sir, you\u2019ve bought yourself a Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>The lady kisses his cheek and marches him off stage. He\u2019s shoved into someone\u2019s lap; he assumes the lap of whoever just bought him. </p><p>\u201cWe will grow in five days worth of the drug we use on him, but if you want more, you\u2019ll need to pay extra.\u201d The lady he decides he actually does hate says. </p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll just take my things and go.\u201d</p><p>Peter is a <i>thing</i> now. He\u2019s just a <i>thing</i>. Oh god. </p><p>~</p><p>A month of living with his master later, Peter is ready to give up completely. Mr. Stark obviously isn\u2019t coming to save the day; and if he isn\u2019t, nobody is. </p><p>His master comes in, shaking Peter awake. \u201cGet up, pet, Master wants you.\u201d</p><p>Peter rubs the sleep from his eyes and nods, opening his mouth obediently. </p><p>Master tsks. \u201cNow, my toy. You must have learned by now that I wouldn\u2019t wake you just for your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Peter winces. He remembers that. He remembers waking up choking and gagging, thinking he was dying. He shoves the blankets down, spreading his legs. His hole had just healed from the night before; his master had been creative. He had used a knife to open Peter up, then fucked him harder than he ever had before. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t make a sound as Master starts to rape him violently. It\u2019s always rough, it always hurts. It always makes Peter\u2019s entire body surge forward, no matter how much he tries to stay still. </p><p>Peter just lets it happen. He stares at the headboard, watching it come closer and get farther away with his master\u2019s thrusts. </p><p>If Peter lets himself think, he\u2019ll think of Mr. Stark. And that always makes him cry, and master punishes him when he cries. </p><p>The last time Peter cried, Master broke his femur bone. Peter had thrown up from the pain, and had passed out. He hadn\u2019t woken up for two days. Master thought he might have died, so he didn\u2019t bother to feed or water Peter. </p><p>Peter closes his eyes and concentrates on how much it hurts. It hurts a lot. Not as much as his leg, though. This is more of a burning pain, a pain you get when you bleed. Which he is. He can hear his blood dripping on the bed, under the sounds of his Master\u2019s hips meetings his own </p><p>His Master finally cums, and gets up with a grunt, leaving Peter. Peter waits until he hears the lock on the outside of his door slide shut before lowering his hips again. He does cry now. Silent tears into his pillow, no noise escaping his mouth. </p><p>He wants to go home. He wants to go home, and he wants his Aunt May, and Mr, Stark, and Ned and MJ&hellip; he wants home. </p><p>He wonders if May knows where he is. If she knows he was kidnapped, or wonders if he died on a mission. He wonders if Tony knows where he is. He probably does. Mr. Stark is so smart, if he wanted to, he could find Peter in a heartbeat. </p><p>He must not want to. </p><p>Peter curls up as he feels his hole stop leaking blood and now only leaks cum. He holds his pillow and cries into it, making sure to be silent. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter smiles dazed at his Master. He thinks he got two doses of his drug tonight, because he\u2019s sleepy and out of it. He giggles as Master rapes him, as he hears his blood drip to the floor. He giggles as some of Master\u2019s friends do the same. He fully laughs when they start breaking his bones, making him bruise, cutting him. He passes out in a fit of laughter. </p><p>Or from blood loss. Peter couldn\u2019t tell. </p><p>~</p><p>Master is fucking Peter so brutally, he thinks his hips might break. They\u2019re in the living room, on the floor. Master already broke the couch; and then he broke Peter\u2019s arm as punishment. His arm throbs, but not as much as his bleeding hole. </p><p>Peter\u2019s cheek is on the floor, facing the window. It\u2019s so pretty outside. He misses being outside. He doesn\u2019t remember how long it\u2019s been since he\u2019s gone outside. He doesn\u2019t remember how long he\u2019s been gone from home. </p><p>All he knows now is pain and blood and drugs and cum. Not his, Of course. Whatever drug they gave him also makes sure he never gets hard. Master almost cut his cock off when he realized, extremely frustrated at the time. </p><p>Peter is glad he didn\u2019t. He doesnt know if his cock would grow back, but it would painful either way. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t look up as the door behind him slams open. He assumes it\u2019s some of Master\u2019s friends here to play too. He closes his eyes and waits for more pain. </p><p>Except there\u2019s screaming now and Master isn\u2019t fucking him anymore and- what\u2019s going on? He tend his head to the other side, looking at the intruder with an emotionless face. Oh, it\u2019s Mr, Stark. He must want a turn too. </p><p>Master told Peter all about how the boy is stupid. And useless. And a bother. And annoying. Peter knows now, thanks to Master, that he\u2019s only good for taking whatever Master wants to give him. And if Master wants to share Peter, Peter can\u2019t complain. At least he\u2019s being useful for once. </p><p>So Peter closes his eyes again and waits for Mr. Stark to rape him too. Peter thinks Master must have given him more drugs, because he passes out while waiting for it. </p><p>~</p><p>When Peter wakes again, he\u2019s in a bed he hasn\u2019t been in before. There\u2019s needles in his arms\u2014they must be giving him more of that drug. He opens his eyes and frowns. This isn\u2019t Master\u2019s home. This is a hospital. </p><p>He looks to his left and sees May crying. Hey look, May is here. He missed her. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. This is just a hallucination. Caused by the drugs. It\u2019s happened before. </p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes again, he sees a man in a white coat. He\u2019s asking questions, but Peter just stares at his lips. He wonders when the man will rape him. He looks around, but he doesn\u2019t see his Master. </p><p>\u201cMr. Parker. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Peter turns his head to the man. Why is he asking that? He nods once, thinking he missed a direction and he\u2019s going to be punished now. </p><p>\u201cGood. The drug is almost completely out of your system, and you\u2019ve been rehydrated. Your Aunt is here, she\u2019s sleeping now. It\u2019s about 3 in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns. Where\u2019s Master? He wants to ask. He hasn\u2019t spoken in&hellip; he doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know if he can speak. </p><p>The man smiles sadly. \u201cI- uh&hellip; the man who was&hellip; holding you, he\u2019s in jail. He won\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns and looks at the ceiling. He\u2019s going to punish me. I want to see Master, I want to show him I wasn\u2019t bad, Peter thinks. Not that it matters, he\u2019ll be punished anyway. </p><p>The man sighs. \u201cGood night, Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>He wakes about 7 hours later, based off the clock on the wall. He turns his head and sees Mr. Stark. He tears up. He wishes this were real. </p><p>Tony looks up and smiles sadly at him. \u201cHey, Underoos. How ya feelin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head, looking away. It isn\u2019t real. It isn\u2019t real. If you let it give you hope, you\u2019ll be hurt again. </p><p>Tony frowns. \u201cThey said you were pretty unresponsive. But you can hear?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods slightly. He shouldn\u2019t have, but he did. </p><p>Tony hums softly. \u201cThat drug he made you take really took a lot out of you. They say you\u2019ll be able to speak, still. It\u2019s a mental thing, they say.\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t look at Tony. </p><p>Tony sighs. \u201cYour Aunt will be here soon. She\u2019s still sleeping. She hadn\u2019t left your bed for a week.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at him at that. A week? He\u2019s been here a week? But&hellip; </p><p>Tony smiles at him, looking pleased Peter is looking at him. \u201cYou were gone for 6 months, kid. The police had given up, but not me. I kept looking.\u201d</p><p>Peter feels a tear fall down his face. This is real. It has to be. He had given up hope Tony was looking for him a long time ago. This isn\u2019t a dream. It\u2019s real. </p><p>Tony smiles more. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. You can cry. That man won\u2019t hurt you anymore. He can\u2019t. He\u2019s too busy sitting in jail.\u201d</p><p>Peter closes his eyes, breath hitching. \u201cMr. Stark&hellip;\u201d he whispers. He hasn\u2019t spoken in 6 months. It\u2019s so overwhelming, hearing his own voice. </p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>A year later, and Peter is still not normal again. His therapist says he never will be. He never speaks, not to his therapist or to May or to MJ or Ned. He can say some things to Mr. Stark, but talking overwhelms him. </p><p>He\u2019s never alone. He can\u2019t use the bathroom without at least one person there for him to watch. Just in case he gets kidnapped again. He can\u2019t shower alone; something Ned and MJ mostly help with. Peter had thought it would be awkward, but it wasn\u2019t. Not to him at least. He was used to people watching him, used to people touching him in ways he wasn\u2019t comfortable with. </p><p>He\u2019s accidentally gotten three teachers at his school fired. </p><p>One raised his voice at Peter and said he would never be good for anything. Peter had panicked and just nodded, turning around and pulling his pants down. He\u2019s used to \u2018you\u2019ll never be good for anything\u2019 to be followed by rape or torture. </p><p>One had actually raped Peter, knowing the boy wouldn\u2019t be able to say no. MJ had caught them. Peter had tried to say he was sorry, but he couldn\u2019t get his mouth to work, and MJ didn\u2019t seem mad at him anyway. </p><p>The last one he accidentally got fired was a girl teacher. She had hugged him, overwhelmed with want to comfort him. He had exposed his neck, waiting for the drugs to come. He tried to tell Ned that she hadn\u2019t touched him, but he couldn\u2019t make himself speak. </p><p>Flash did a complete 180. After what happened with Ms. White, he refused to let Peter go anywhere without him. Not to the bathroom, not to class, not to the bus. He drove Peter to and from school, now, do it isn\u2019t like he needed to go to the bus anyway. </p><p>Peter wants to say thank you, but the best he can do is write it down. Flash seems to know anyways. </p><p>When he isn\u2019t with his friends or May, he\u2019s with Tony. Tony is the only one that doesn\u2019t treat him any differently. He acts as if it never happened. </p><p>Peter wishes he knew if that was for his sake or Tony\u2019s, but he doesn\u2019t think it matters anyway. </p><p>He can\u2019t sleep alone. At first, he slept on May\u2019s floor. He was used to being on the floor. But he kept having nightmares and waking her up, so he tried to sleep outside her door instead. </p><p>When that didn\u2019t help, Mr. Stark started sleeping in Peter\u2019s bed. Peter was scared at first, but Tony never touched him. He stayed on his side of the bed and didn\u2019t move. </p><p>Peter eventually got used to it, but he still feels bad for waking Mr, Stark up with his nightmares. </p><p>~</p><p>Five years after the accident, and Peter is as close to normal as he\u2019ll ever be. He speaks, now, although not as much as before. He can shower and use the bathroom alone. He has his college set up so Flash can always give him a ride, and Ned is always sitting next to him. </p><p>He\u2019s learned to not feel guilty for these things. </p><p>He can\u2019t sleep alone, so Mr. Stark keeps him company at night. </p><p>He can\u2019t ever be alone. He always has Flash, MJ, Ned, Tony, or May with him. One or more, at all times. </p><p>He\u2019s Spider-Man again, too. Although his man in the chair is always on the phone with him; that or Mr. Stark is patrolling with him. </p><p>He isn\u2019t the best superhero, but he\u2019s doing something at least. </p><p>~</p><p>After his college graduation, he goes to work for SI. He invents things, makes things, and he\u2019s always with Tony. He moved in with Tony a long time ago, because May deserved her space. He sees his friends every day; Ned is even his coworker. </p><p>Mr. Stark saved him, not just the night he found Peter; but throughout all these years too. He hasn\u2019t given up on Peter. He never gave up on Peter. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d He whispers one night. It\u2019s late, and Tony is scrolling on his Stark pad. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He asks. He always gets excited when Peter talks to him. Even though he has been for a long time. </p><p>Peter swallows thickly. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Tony\u2019s smile fades. He never pretended he was Peter\u2019s boyfriend. He never kissed him, never acted possessive. He can\u2019t help but wonder what he did wrong&hellip; \u201cNo, Peter, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Peter tears up but nods, turning back over. He thought it was a good idea. Tony took care of him, slept in his bed, did everything from him. He didn\u2019t think anything would change from how it is now. He must have been wrong. He\u2019s too damaged for Mr. Stark to ever want him. Tony helps because he feels pity for Peter, that\u2019s all. </p><p>Tony sighs and takes Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you Peter, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and doesn\u2019t look at Tony. He stands and goes to the living room without a word. </p><p>Tony sighs and follows him. Peter can\u2019t sleep alone. \u201cCome back to bed Peter, please. You need sleep.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head and grabs a glass of whiskey. It\u2019s become his favorite, even though Tony disapproves. </p><p>Tony sighs. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me Peter. You don\u2019t have to pay me back.\u201d</p><p>Peter turns to him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay you back. I want to marry you because I trust you not to hurt me. I trust you to take care of me. I trust you not to rape me.\u201d He pauses as Tony flinched, but keeps going. \u201cI trust you, and I love you, and I want to be married to you because of that. Not because I owe you.\u201d</p><p>Tony feels his own tears fall down his face. He nods slowly, clearing histhroat. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t feel like you owe me.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Their wedding is perfect. It\u2019s beautiful and he\u2019s beautiful, and Tony is the luckiest bastard ever. </p><p>When they get to the honeymoon destination, Tony doesn\u2019t let Peter Touch him. He just smiles and kisses Peter\u2019s forehead, pulling him to bed. \u201cSleep, baby. I\u2019m your husband, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>Peter tears up, and for the first time in years, it\u2019s because he\u2019s happy. So he nods and kisses Tony\u2019s cheek. </p><p>And Peter sleeps.  </p>",

            "comment": "<p>Warnings: Peter is 15 in this. He gets hurt. A lot. Mentally physically and sexually. All the ways. Please don\u2019t read this if that could hurt you. </p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Peter sobs and curls up as the van stops. He doesn\u2019t know what they drugged him with, but it\u2019s enough to stop Spider-Man. It must be bad. He\u2019s pulled out of the van and slapped again, then dragged into a place where they feel comfortable enough to take his blindfold off. </p><p>He whimpers as they shove him against a wall. They turn on a hose and cold water showers over him. They strip his clothes, and wash him <i>everywhere</i>. He hates it. He hates this. </p><p>They put a new blindfold on him and shove him back into the van. Now he\u2019s cold, naked, and bruised everywhere. </p><p>He sobs until he passes out. </p><p>~</p><p>When he next wakes, he\u2019s on the floor of what looks like a hospital. It can\u2019t be though; it isn\u2019t white. It\u2019s all dark. </p><p>A man comes in and picks Peter up by the hair and shoves him on the bed. The first thing he does is shove a needle into Peter\u2019s neck. Peter sobs but doesn\u2019t fight back. It must be more of whatever the drug is. </p><p>Next, he ties Peter\u2019s hands behind his back, and then he moves to Peter\u2019s butt. </p><p>Peter has never been touched there, but he can\u2019t do anything but drool into the gag as he\u2019s started to get fingered. </p><p>Peter passes out before the third finger. </p><p>~</p><p>When Peter is woken again, they give him two cups. One has a pill in it, and the other water. They force him to swallow down both. </p><p>Peter sobs and leans into the woman who starts to groom him. She brushes his hair, shaved his face. Then she waxed his chest, stomach, armpits, legs\u2026 then his pubic hair and his asshole. It hurts so fucking much, but the woman soothes him and rubs lotion everywhere it hurts. </p><p>Peter walls asleep again. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes this time, the lady he\u2019s started to not hate forces him to drink some water, and then carefully pushes the needle in again. He whimpers in pain and she soothes him again. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Peter. It\u2019ll all be alright soon.\u201d She says over and over. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t believe her. </p><p>~</p><p>And hour after she left, he\u2019s lead out of his room and into a new one. He is on what could be interpreted as a stage, and and told to stand still. It isn\u2019t like he could leave if he wanted to. </p><p>Suddenly the lights come on and he pales. He is on a stage. In front of hundreds of people. </p><p>\u201cThis one is very special, and we\u2019ve saved him for last. This here is Spider-Man! Not only is he a hero, he\u2019s also a hero who heals super quickly.\u201d</p><p>The lady he likes pulls out a knife and sliced his cheek. He whimpers and she shushes him. The crowd applauses as he heals fully. </p><p>\u201cWe will start the bidding at $1,000,000.\u201d Peter feels dazed as people bid on him. He feels like he might die when the person who buys him pays one billion USD. Just for Peter. Oh god, Peter is going to die!</p><p>\u201c$1,000,000,000 in the back! Congratulations sir, you\u2019ve bought yourself a Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>The lady kisses his cheek and marches him off stage. He\u2019s shoved into someone\u2019s lap; he assumes the lap of whoever just bought him. </p><p>\u201cWe will grow in five days worth of the drug we use on him, but if you want more, you\u2019ll need to pay extra.\u201d The lady he decides he actually does hate says. </p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll just take my things and go.\u201d</p><p>Peter is a <i>thing</i> now. He\u2019s just a <i>thing</i>. Oh god. </p><p>~</p><p>A month of living with his master later, Peter is ready to give up completely. Mr. Stark obviously isn\u2019t coming to save the day; and if he isn\u2019t, nobody is. </p><p>His master comes in, shaking Peter awake. \u201cGet up, pet, Master wants you.\u201d</p><p>Peter rubs the sleep from his eyes and nods, opening his mouth obediently. </p><p>Master tsks. \u201cNow, my toy. You must have learned by now that I wouldn\u2019t wake you just for your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Peter winces. He remembers that. He remembers waking up choking and gagging, thinking he was dying. He shoves the blankets down, spreading his legs. His hole had just healed from the night before; his master had been creative. He had used a knife to open Peter up, then fucked him harder than he ever had before. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t make a sound as Master starts to rape him violently. It\u2019s always rough, it always hurts. It always makes Peter\u2019s entire body surge forward, no matter how much he tries to stay still. </p><p>Peter just lets it happen. He stares at the headboard, watching it come closer and get farther away with his master\u2019s thrusts. </p><p>If Peter lets himself think, he\u2019ll think of Mr. Stark. And that always makes him cry, and master punishes him when he cries. </p><p>The last time Peter cried, Master broke his femur bone. Peter had thrown up from the pain, and had passed out. He hadn\u2019t woken up for two days. Master thought he might have died, so he didn\u2019t bother to feed or water Peter. </p><p>Peter closes his eyes and concentrates on how much it hurts. It hurts a lot. Not as much as his leg, though. This is more of a burning pain, a pain you get when you bleed. Which he is. He can hear his blood dripping on the bed, under the sounds of his Master\u2019s hips meetings his own </p><p>His Master finally cums, and gets up with a grunt, leaving Peter. Peter waits until he hears the lock on the outside of his door slide shut before lowering his hips again. He does cry now. Silent tears into his pillow, no noise escaping his mouth. </p><p>He wants to go home. He wants to go home, and he wants his Aunt May, and Mr, Stark, and Ned and MJ\u2026 he wants home. </p><p>He wonders if May knows where he is. If she knows he was kidnapped, or wonders if he died on a mission. He wonders if Tony knows where he is. He probably does. Mr. Stark is so smart, if he wanted to, he could find Peter in a heartbeat. </p><p>He must not want to. </p><p>Peter curls up as he feels his hole stop leaking blood and now only leaks cum. He holds his pillow and cries into it, making sure to be silent. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter smiles dazed at his Master. He thinks he got two doses of his drug tonight, because he\u2019s sleepy and out of it. He giggles as Master rapes him, as he hears his blood drip to the floor. He giggles as some of Master\u2019s friends do the same. He fully laughs when they start breaking his bones, making him bruise, cutting him. He passes out in a fit of laughter. </p><p>Or from blood loss. Peter couldn\u2019t tell. </p><p>~</p><p>Master is fucking Peter so brutally, he thinks his hips might break. They\u2019re in the living room, on the floor. Master already broke the couch; and then he broke Peter\u2019s arm as punishment. His arm throbs, but not as much as his bleeding hole. </p><p>Peter\u2019s cheek is on the floor, facing the window. It\u2019s so pretty outside. He misses being outside. He doesn\u2019t remember how long it\u2019s been since he\u2019s gone outside. He doesn\u2019t remember how long he\u2019s been gone from home. </p><p>All he knows now is pain and blood and drugs and cum. Not his, Of course. Whatever drug they gave him also makes sure he never gets hard. Master almost cut his cock off when he realized, extremely frustrated at the time. </p><p>Peter is glad he didn\u2019t. He doesnt know if his cock would grow back, but it would painful either way. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t look up as the door behind him slams open. He assumes it\u2019s some of Master\u2019s friends here to play too. He closes his eyes and waits for more pain. </p><p>Except there\u2019s screaming now and Master isn\u2019t fucking him anymore and- what\u2019s going on? He tend his head to the other side, looking at the intruder with an emotionless face. Oh, it\u2019s Mr, Stark. He must want a turn too. </p><p>Master told Peter all about how the boy is stupid. And useless. And a bother. And annoying. Peter knows now, thanks to Master, that he\u2019s only good for taking whatever Master wants to give him. And if Master wants to share Peter, Peter can\u2019t complain. At least he\u2019s being useful for once. </p><p>So Peter closes his eyes again and waits for Mr. Stark to rape him too. Peter thinks Master must have given him more drugs, because he passes out while waiting for it. </p><p>~</p><p>When Peter wakes again, he\u2019s in a bed he hasn\u2019t been in before. There\u2019s needles in his arms\u2014they must be giving him more of that drug. He opens his eyes and frowns. This isn\u2019t Master\u2019s home. This is a hospital. </p><p>He looks to his left and sees May crying. Hey look, May is here. He missed her. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. This is just a hallucination. Caused by the drugs. It\u2019s happened before. </p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes again, he sees a man in a white coat. He\u2019s asking questions, but Peter just stares at his lips. He wonders when the man will rape him. He looks around, but he doesn\u2019t see his Master. </p><p>\u201cMr. Parker. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Peter turns his head to the man. Why is he asking that? He nods once, thinking he missed a direction and he\u2019s going to be punished now. </p><p>\u201cGood. The drug is almost completely out of your system, and you\u2019ve been rehydrated. Your Aunt is here, she\u2019s sleeping now. It\u2019s about 3 in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns. Where\u2019s Master? He wants to ask. He hasn\u2019t spoken in\u2026 he doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know if he can speak. </p><p>The man smiles sadly. \u201cI- uh\u2026 the man who was\u2026 holding you, he\u2019s in jail. He won\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns and looks at the ceiling. He\u2019s going to punish me. I want to see Master, I want to show him I wasn\u2019t bad, Peter thinks. Not that it matters, he\u2019ll be punished anyway. </p><p>The man sighs. \u201cGood night, Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>He wakes about 7 hours later, based off the clock on the wall. He turns his head and sees Mr. Stark. He tears up. He wishes this were real. </p><p>Tony looks up and smiles sadly at him. \u201cHey, Underoos. How ya feelin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head, looking away. It isn\u2019t real. It isn\u2019t real. If you let it give you hope, you\u2019ll be hurt again. </p><p>Tony frowns. \u201cThey said you were pretty unresponsive. But you can hear?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods slightly. He shouldn\u2019t have, but he did. </p><p>Tony hums softly. \u201cThat drug he made you take really took a lot out of you. They say you\u2019ll be able to speak, still. It\u2019s a mental thing, they say.\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t look at Tony. </p><p>Tony sighs. \u201cYour Aunt will be here soon. She\u2019s still sleeping. She hadn\u2019t left your bed for a week.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at him at that. A week? He\u2019s been here a week? But\u2026 </p><p>Tony smiles at him, looking pleased Peter is looking at him. \u201cYou were gone for 6 months, kid. The police had given up, but not me. I kept looking.\u201d</p><p>Peter feels a tear fall down his face. This is real. It has to be. He had given up hope Tony was looking for him a long time ago. This isn\u2019t a dream. It\u2019s real. </p><p>Tony smiles more. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. You can cry. That man won\u2019t hurt you anymore. He can\u2019t. He\u2019s too busy sitting in jail.\u201d</p><p>Peter closes his eyes, breath hitching. \u201cMr. Stark\u2026\u201d he whispers. He hasn\u2019t spoken in 6 months. It\u2019s so overwhelming, hearing his own voice. </p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>A year later, and Peter is still not normal again. His therapist says he never will be.

It\u2019s become his favorite, even though Tony disapproves. </p><p>Tony sighs. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me Peter. You don\u2019t have to pay me back.\u201d</p><p>Peter turns to him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay you back. I want to marry you because I trust you not to hurt me. I trust you to take care of me. I trust you not to rape me.\u201d He pauses as Tony flinched, but keeps going. \u201cI trust you, and I love you, and I want to be married to you because of that. Not because I owe you.\u201d</p><p>Tony feels his own tears fall down his face. He nods slowly, clearing histhroat. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t feel like you owe me.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Their wedding is perfect. It\u2019s beautiful and he\u2019s beautiful, and Tony is the luckiest bastard ever. </p><p>When they get to the honeymoon destination, Tony doesn\u2019t let Peter Touch him. He just smiles and kisses Peter\u2019s forehead, pulling him to bed. \u201cSleep, baby. I\u2019m your husband, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>Peter tears up, and for the first time in years, it\u2019s because he\u2019s happy. So he nods and kisses Tony\u2019s cheek. </p><p>And Peter sleeps.  </p>",

Please don\u2019t read this if that could hurt you. </p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Peter sobs and curls up as the van stops. He doesn\u2019t know what they drugged him with, but it\u2019s enough to stop Spider-Man. It must be bad. He\u2019s pulled out of the van and slapped again, then dragged into a place where they feel comfortable enough to take his blindfold off. </p><p>He whimpers as they shove him against a wall. They turn on a hose and cold water showers over him. They strip his clothes, and wash him <i>everywhere</i>. He hates it. He hates this. </p><p>They put a new blindfold on him and shove him back into the van. Now he\u2019s cold, naked, and bruised everywhere. </p><p>He sobs until he passes out. </p><p>~</p><p>When he next wakes, he\u2019s on the floor of what looks like a hospital. It can\u2019t be though; it isn\u2019t white. It\u2019s all dark. </p><p>A man comes in and picks Peter up by the hair and shoves him on the bed. The first thing he does is shove a needle into Peter\u2019s neck. Peter sobs but doesn\u2019t fight back. It must be more of whatever the drug is. </p><p>Next, he ties Peter\u2019s hands behind his back, and then he moves to Peter\u2019s butt. </p><p>Peter has never been touched there, but he can\u2019t do anything but drool into the gag as he\u2019s started to get fingered. </p><p>Peter passes out before the third finger. </p><p>~</p><p>When Peter is woken again, they give him two cups. One has a pill in it, and the other water. They force him to swallow down both. </p><p>Peter sobs and leans into the woman who starts to groom him. She brushes his hair, shaved his face. Then she waxed his chest, stomach, armpits, legs\u2026 then his pubic hair and his asshole. It hurts so fucking much, but the woman soothes him and rubs lotion everywhere it hurts. </p><p>Peter walls asleep again. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes this time, the lady he\u2019s started to not hate forces him to drink some water, and then carefully pushes the needle in again. He whimpers in pain and she soothes him again. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Peter. It\u2019ll all be alright soon.\u201d She says over and over. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t believe her. </p><p>~</p><p>And hour after she left, he\u2019s lead out of his room and into a new one. He is on what could be interpreted as a stage, and and told to stand still. It isn\u2019t like he could leave if he wanted to. </p><p>Suddenly the lights come on and he pales. He is on a stage. In front of hundreds of people. </p><p>\u201cThis one is very special, and we\u2019ve saved him for last. This here is Spider-Man! Not only is he a hero, he\u2019s also a hero who heals super quickly.\u201d</p><p>The lady he likes pulls out a knife and sliced his cheek. He whimpers and she shushes him. The crowd applauses as he heals fully. </p><p>\u201cWe will start the bidding at $1,000,000.\u201d Peter feels dazed as people bid on him. He feels like he might die when the person who buys him pays one billion USD. Just for Peter. Oh god, Peter is going to die!</p><p>\u201c$1,000,000,000 in the back! Congratulations sir, you\u2019ve bought yourself a Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>The lady kisses his cheek and marches him off stage. He\u2019s shoved into someone\u2019s lap; he assumes the lap of whoever just bought him. </p><p>\u201cWe will grow in five days worth of the drug we use on him, but if you want more, you\u2019ll need to pay extra.\u201d The lady he decides he actually does hate says. </p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll just take my things and go.\u201d</p><p>Peter is a <i>thing</i> now. He\u2019s just a <i>thing</i>. Oh god. </p><p>~</p><p>A month of living with his master later, Peter is ready to give up completely. Mr. Stark obviously isn\u2019t coming to save the day; and if he isn\u2019t, nobody is. </p><p>His master comes in, shaking Peter awake. \u201cGet up, pet, Master wants you.\u201d</p><p>Peter rubs the sleep from his eyes and nods, opening his mouth obediently. </p><p>Master tsks. \u201cNow, my toy. You must have learned by now that I wouldn\u2019t wake you just for your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Peter winces. He remembers that. He remembers waking up choking and gagging, thinking he was dying. He shoves the blankets down, spreading his legs. His hole had just healed from the night before; his master had been creative. He had used a knife to open Peter up, then fucked him harder than he ever had before. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t make a sound as Master starts to rape him violently. It\u2019s always rough, it always hurts. It always makes Peter\u2019s entire body surge forward, no matter how much he tries to stay still. </p><p>Peter just lets it happen. He stares at the headboard, watching it come closer and get farther away with his master\u2019s thrusts. </p><p>If Peter lets himself think, he\u2019ll think of Mr. Stark. And that always makes him cry, and master punishes him when he cries. </p><p>The last time Peter cried, Master broke his femur bone. Peter had thrown up from the pain, and had passed out. He hadn\u2019t woken up for two days. Master thought he might have died, so he didn\u2019t bother to feed or water Peter. </p><p>Peter closes his eyes and concentrates on how much it hurts. It hurts a lot. Not as much as his leg, though. This is more of a burning pain, a pain you get when you bleed. Which he is. He can hear his blood dripping on the bed, under the sounds of his Master\u2019s hips meetings his own </p><p>His Master finally cums, and gets up with a grunt, leaving Peter. Peter waits until he hears the lock on the outside of his door slide shut before lowering his hips again. He does cry now. Silent tears into his pillow, no noise escaping his mouth. </p><p>He wants to go home. He wants to go home, and he wants his Aunt May, and Mr, Stark, and Ned and MJ\u2026 he wants home. </p><p>He wonders if May knows where he is. If she knows he was kidnapped, or wonders if he died on a mission. He wonders if Tony knows where he is. He probably does. Mr. Stark is so smart, if he wanted to, he could find Peter in a heartbeat. </p><p>He must not want to. </p><p>Peter curls up as he feels his hole stop leaking blood and now only leaks cum. He holds his pillow and cries into it, making sure to be silent. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter smiles dazed at his Master. He thinks he got two doses of his drug tonight, because he\u2019s sleepy and out of it. He giggles as Master rapes him, as he hears his blood drip to the floor. He giggles as some of Master\u2019s friends do the same. He fully laughs when they start breaking his bones, making him bruise, cutting him. He passes out in a fit of laughter. </p><p>Or from blood loss. Peter couldn\u2019t tell. </p><p>~</p><p>Master is fucking Peter so brutally, he thinks his hips might break. They\u2019re in the living room, on the floor. Master already broke the couch; and then he broke Peter\u2019s arm as punishment. His arm throbs, but not as much as his bleeding hole. </p><p>Peter\u2019s cheek is on the floor, facing the window. It\u2019s so pretty outside. He misses being outside. He doesn\u2019t remember how long it\u2019s been since he\u2019s gone outside. He doesn\u2019t remember how long he\u2019s been gone from home. </p><p>All he knows now is pain and blood and drugs and cum. Not his, Of course. Whatever drug they gave him also makes sure he never gets hard. Master almost cut his cock off when he realized, extremely frustrated at the time. </p><p>Peter is glad he didn\u2019t. He doesnt know if his cock would grow back, but it would painful either way. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t look up as the door behind him slams open. He assumes it\u2019s some of Master\u2019s friends here to play too. He closes his eyes and waits for more pain. </p><p>Except there\u2019s screaming now and Master isn\u2019t fucking him anymore and- what\u2019s going on? He tend his head to the other side, looking at the intruder with an emotionless face. Oh, it\u2019s Mr, Stark. He must want a turn too. </p><p>Master told Peter all about how the boy is stupid. And useless. And a bother. And annoying. Peter knows now, thanks to Master, that he\u2019s only good for taking whatever Master wants to give him. And if Master wants to share Peter, Peter can\u2019t complain. At least he\u2019s being useful for once. </p><p>So Peter closes his eyes again and waits for Mr. Stark to rape him too. Peter thinks Master must have given him more drugs, because he passes out while waiting for it. </p><p>~</p><p>When Peter wakes again, he\u2019s in a bed he hasn\u2019t been in before. There\u2019s needles in his arms\u2014they must be giving him more of that drug. He opens his eyes and frowns. This isn\u2019t Master\u2019s home. This is a hospital. </p><p>He looks to his left and sees May crying. Hey look, May is here. He missed her. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. This is just a hallucination. Caused by the drugs. It\u2019s happened before. </p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes again, he sees a man in a white coat. He\u2019s asking questions, but Peter just stares at his lips. He wonders when the man will rape him. He looks around, but he doesn\u2019t see his Master. </p><p>\u201cMr. Parker. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Peter turns his head to the man. Why is he asking that? He nods once, thinking he missed a direction and he\u2019s going to be punished now. </p><p>\u201cGood. The drug is almost completely out of your system, and you\u2019ve been rehydrated. Your Aunt is here, she\u2019s sleeping now. It\u2019s about 3 in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns. Where\u2019s Master? He wants to ask. He hasn\u2019t spoken in\u2026 he doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know if he can speak. </p><p>The man smiles sadly. \u201cI- uh\u2026 the man who was\u2026 holding you, he\u2019s in jail. He won\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns and looks at the ceiling. He\u2019s going to punish me. I want to see Master, I want to show him I wasn\u2019t bad, Peter thinks. Not that it matters, he\u2019ll be punished anyway. </p><p>The man sighs. \u201cGood night, Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>He wakes about 7 hours later, based off the clock on the wall. He turns his head and sees Mr. Stark. He tears up. He wishes this were real. </p><p>Tony looks up and smiles sadly at him. \u201cHey, Underoos. How ya feelin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head, looking away. It isn\u2019t real. It isn\u2019t real. If you let it give you hope, you\u2019ll be hurt again. </p><p>Tony frowns. \u201cThey said you were pretty unresponsive. But you can hear?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods slightly. He shouldn\u2019t have, but he did. </p><p>Tony hums softly. \u201cThat drug he made you take really took a lot out of you. They say you\u2019ll be able to speak, still. It\u2019s a mental thing, they say.\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t look at Tony. </p><p>Tony sighs. \u201cYour Aunt will be here soon. She\u2019s still sleeping. She hadn\u2019t left your bed for a week.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at him at that. A week? He\u2019s been here a week? But\u2026 </p><p>Tony smiles at him, looking pleased Peter is looking at him. \u201cYou were gone for 6 months, kid. The police had given up, but not me. I kept looking.\u201d</p><p>Peter feels a tear fall down his face. This is real. It has to be. He had given up hope Tony was looking for him a long time ago. This isn\u2019t a dream. It\u2019s real. </p><p>Tony smiles more. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. You can cry. That man won\u2019t hurt you anymore. He can\u2019t. He\u2019s too busy sitting in jail.\u201d</p><p>Peter closes his eyes, breath hitching. \u201cMr. Stark\u2026\u201d he whispers. He hasn\u2019t spoken in 6 months. It\u2019s so overwhelming, hearing his own voice. </p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>A year later, and Peter is still not normal again. His therapist says he never will be. He never speaks, not to his therapist or to May or to MJ or Ned. He can say some things to Mr. Stark, but talking overwhelms him. </p><p>He\u2019s never alone. He can\u2019t use the bathroom without at least one person there for him to watch. Just in case he gets kidnapped again. He can\u2019t shower alone; something Ned and MJ mostly help with. Peter had thought it would be awkward, but it wasn\u2019t. Not to him at least. He was used to people watching him, used to people touching him in ways he wasn\u2019t comfortable with. </p><p>He\u2019s accidentally gotten three teachers at his school fired. </p><p>One raised his voice at Peter and said he would never be good for anything. Peter had panicked and just nodded, turning around and pulling his pants down. He\u2019s used to \u2018you\u2019ll never be good for anything\u2019 to be followed by rape or torture. </p><p>One had actually raped Peter, knowing the boy wouldn\u2019t be able to say no. MJ had caught them. Peter had tried to say he was sorry, but he couldn\u2019t get his mouth to work, and MJ didn\u2019t seem mad at him anyway. </p><p>The last one he accidentally got fired was a girl teacher. She had hugged him, overwhelmed with want to comfort him. He had exposed his neck, waiting for the drugs to come. He tried to tell Ned that she hadn\u2019t touched him, but he couldn\u2019t make himself speak. </p><p>Flash did a complete 180. After what happened with Ms. White, he refused to let Peter go anywhere without him. Not to the bathroom, not to class, not to the bus. He drove Peter to and from school, now, do it isn\u2019t like he needed to go to the bus anyway. </p><p>Peter wants to say thank you, but the best he can do is write it down. Flash seems to know anyways. </p><p>When he isn\u2019t with his friends or May, he\u2019s with Tony. Tony is the only one that doesn\u2019t treat him any differently. He acts as if it never happened. </p><p>Peter wishes he knew if that was for his sake or Tony\u2019s, but he doesn\u2019t think it matters anyway. </p><p>He can\u2019t sleep alone. At first, he slept on May\u2019s floor. He was used to being on the floor. But he kept having nightmares and waking her up, so he tried to sleep outside her door instead. </p><p>When that didn\u2019t help, Mr. Stark started sleeping in Peter\u2019s bed. Peter was scared at first, but Tony never touched him. He stayed on his side of the bed and didn\u2019t move. </p><p>Peter eventually got used to it, but he still feels bad for waking Mr, Stark up with his nightmares. </p><p>~</p><p>Five years after the accident, and Peter is as close to normal as he\u2019ll ever be. He speaks, now, although not as much as before. He can shower and use the bathroom alone. He has his college set up so Flash can always give him a ride, and Ned is always sitting next to him. </p><p>He\u2019s learned to not feel guilty for these things. </p><p>He can\u2019t sleep alone, so Mr. Stark keeps him company at night. </p><p>He can\u2019t ever be alone. He always has Flash, MJ, Ned, Tony, or May with him. One or more, at all times. </p><p>He\u2019s Spider-Man again, too. Although his man in the chair is always on the phone with him; that or Mr. Stark is patrolling with him. </p><p>He isn\u2019t the best superhero, but he\u2019s doing something at least. </p><p>~</p><p>After his college graduation, he goes to work for SI. He invents things, makes things, and he\u2019s always with Tony. He moved in with Tony a long time ago, because May deserved her space. He sees his friends every day; Ned is even his coworker. </p><p>Mr. Stark saved him, not just the night he found Peter; but throughout all these years too. He hasn\u2019t given up on Peter. He never gave up on Peter. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d He whispers one night. It\u2019s late, and Tony is scrolling on his Stark pad. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He asks. He always gets excited when Peter talks to him. Even though he has been for a long time. </p><p>Peter swallows thickly. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Tony\u2019s smile fades. He never pretended he was Peter\u2019s boyfriend. He never kissed him, never acted possessive. He can\u2019t help but wonder what he did wrong\u2026 \u201cNo, Peter, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Peter tears up but nods, turning back over. He thought it was a good idea. Tony took care of him, slept in his bed, did everything from him. He didn\u2019t think anything would change from how it is now. He must have been wrong. He\u2019s too damaged for Mr. Stark to ever want him. Tony helps because he feels pity for Peter, that\u2019s all. </p><p>Tony sighs and takes Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you Peter, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and doesn\u2019t look at Tony. He stands and goes to the living room without a word. </p><p>Tony sighs and follows him. Peter can\u2019t sleep alone. \u201cCome back to bed Peter, please. You need sleep.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head and grabs a glass of whiskey. It\u2019s become his favorite, even though Tony disapproves. </p><p>Tony sighs. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me Peter. You don\u2019t have to pay me back.\u201d</p><p>Peter turns to him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay you back. I want to marry you because I trust you not to hurt me. I trust you to take care of me. I trust you not to rape me.\u201d He pauses as Tony flinched, but keeps going. \u201cI trust you, and I love you, and I want to be married to you because of that. Not because I owe you.\u201d</p><p>Tony feels his own tears fall down his face. He nods slowly, clearing histhroat. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t feel like you owe me.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Their wedding is perfect. It\u2019s beautiful and he\u2019s beautiful, and Tony is the luckiest bastard ever. </p><p>When they get to the honeymoon destination, Tony doesn\u2019t let Peter Touch him. He just smiles and kisses Peter\u2019s forehead, pulling him to bed. \u201cSleep, baby. I\u2019m your husband, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>Peter tears up, and for the first time in years, it\u2019s because he\u2019s happy. So he nods and kisses Tony\u2019s cheek. </p><p>And Peter sleeps.  </p>",

He hates this. </p><p>They put a new blindfold on him and shove him back into the van. Now he&rsquo;s cold, naked, and bruised everywhere. </p><p>He sobs until he passes out. </p><p>~</p><p>When he next wakes, he&rsquo;s on the floor of what looks like a hospital. It can&rsquo;t be though; it isn&rsquo;t white. It&rsquo;s all dark. </p><p>A man comes in and picks Peter up by the hair and shoves him on the bed. The first thing he does is shove a needle into Peter&rsquo;s neck. Peter sobs but doesn&rsquo;t fight back. It must be more of whatever the drug is. </p><p>Next, he ties Peter&rsquo;s hands behind his back, and then he moves to Peter&rsquo;s butt. </p><p>Peter has never been touched there, but he can&rsquo;t do anything but drool into the gag as he&rsquo;s started to get fingered. </p><p>Peter passes out before the third finger. </p><p>~</p><p>When Peter is woken again, they give him two cups. One has a pill in it, and the other water. They force him to swallow down both. </p><p>Peter sobs and leans into the woman who starts to groom him. She brushes his hair, shaved his face. Then she waxed his chest, stomach, armpits, legs&hellip; then his pubic hair and his asshole. It hurts so fucking much, but the woman soothes him and rubs lotion everywhere it hurts. </p><p>Peter walls asleep again. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes this time, the lady he&rsquo;s started to not hate forces him to drink some water, and then carefully pushes the needle in again. He whimpers in pain and she soothes him again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, Peter. It&rsquo;ll all be alright soon.&rdquo; She says over and over. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t believe her. </p><p>~</p><p>And hour after she left, he&rsquo;s lead out of his room and into a new one. He is on what could be interpreted as a stage, and and told to stand still. It isn&rsquo;t like he could leave if he wanted to. </p><p>Suddenly the lights come on and he pales. He is on a stage. In front of hundreds of people. </p><p>&ldquo;This one is very special, and we&rsquo;ve saved him for last. This here is Spider-Man! Not only is he a hero, he&rsquo;s also a hero who heals super quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>The lady he likes pulls out a knife and sliced his cheek. He whimpers and she shushes him. The crowd applauses as he heals fully. </p><p>&ldquo;We will start the bidding at $1,000,000.&rdquo; Peter feels dazed as people bid on him. He feels like he might die when the person who buys him pays one billion USD. Just for Peter. Oh god, Peter is going to die!</p><p>&ldquo;$1,000,000,000 in the back! Congratulations sir, you&rsquo;ve bought yourself a Spider-Man!&rdquo;</p><p>The lady kisses his cheek and marches him off stage. He&rsquo;s shoved into someone&rsquo;s lap; he assumes the lap of whoever just bought him. </p><p>&ldquo;We will grow in five days worth of the drug we use on him, but if you want more, you&rsquo;ll need to pay extra.&rdquo; The lady he decides he actually does hate says. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll just take my things and go.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter is a <i>thing</i> now. He&rsquo;s just a <i>thing</i>. Oh god. </p><p>~</p><p>A month of living with his master later, Peter is ready to give up completely. Mr. Stark obviously isn&rsquo;t coming to save the day; and if he isn&rsquo;t, nobody is. </p><p>His master comes in, shaking Peter awake. &ldquo;Get up, pet, Master wants you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter rubs the sleep from his eyes and nods, opening his mouth obediently. </p><p>Master tsks. &ldquo;Now, my toy. You must have learned by now that I wouldn&rsquo;t wake you just for your mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter winces. He remembers that. He remembers waking up choking and gagging, thinking he was dying. He shoves the blankets down, spreading his legs. His hole had just healed from the night before; his master had been creative. He had used a knife to open Peter up, then fucked him harder than he ever had before. </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t make a sound as Master starts to rape him violently. It&rsquo;s always rough, it always hurts. It always makes Peter&rsquo;s entire body surge forward, no matter how much he tries to stay still. </p><p>Peter just lets it happen. He stares at the headboard, watching it come closer and get farther away with his master&rsquo;s thrusts. </p><p>If Peter lets himself think, he&rsquo;ll think of Mr. Stark. And that always makes him cry, and master punishes him when he cries. </p><p>The last time Peter cried, Master broke his femur bone. Peter had thrown up from the pain, and had passed out. He hadn&rsquo;t woken up for two days. Master thought he might have died, so he didn&rsquo;t bother to feed or water Peter. </p><p>Peter closes his eyes and concentrates on how much it hurts. It hurts a lot. Not as much as his leg, though. This is more of a burning pain, a pain you get when you bleed. Which he is. He can hear his blood dripping on the bed, under the sounds of his Master&rsquo;s hips meetings his own </p><p>His Master finally cums, and gets up with a grunt, leaving Peter. Peter waits until he hears the lock on the outside of his door slide shut before lowering his hips again. He does cry now. Silent tears into his pillow, no noise escaping his mouth. </p><p>He wants to go home. He wants to go home, and he wants his Aunt May, and Mr, Stark, and Ned and MJ&hellip; he wants home. </p><p>He wonders if May knows where he is. If she knows he was kidnapped, or wonders if he died on a mission. He wonders if Tony knows where he is. He probably does. Mr. Stark is so smart, if he wanted to, he could find Peter in a heartbeat. </p><p>He must not want to. </p><p>Peter curls up as he feels his hole stop leaking blood and now only leaks cum. He holds his pillow and cries into it, making sure to be silent. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter smiles dazed at his Master. He thinks he got two doses of his drug tonight, because he&rsquo;s sleepy and out of it. He giggles as Master rapes him, as he hears his blood drip to the floor. He giggles as some of Master&rsquo;s friends do the same. He fully laughs when they start breaking his bones, making him bruise, cutting him. He passes out in a fit of laughter. </p><p>Or from blood loss. Peter couldn&rsquo;t tell. </p><p>~</p><p>Master is fucking Peter so brutally, he thinks his hips might break. They&rsquo;re in the living room, on the floor. Master already broke the couch; and then he broke Peter&rsquo;s arm as punishment. His arm throbs, but not as much as his bleeding hole. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s cheek is on the floor, facing the window. It&rsquo;s so pretty outside. He misses being outside. He doesn&rsquo;t remember how long it&rsquo;s been since he&rsquo;s gone outside. He doesn&rsquo;t remember how long he&rsquo;s been gone from home. </p><p>All he knows now is pain and blood and drugs and cum. Not his, Of course. Whatever drug they gave him also makes sure he never gets hard. Master almost cut his cock off when he realized, extremely frustrated at the time. </p><p>Peter is glad he didn&rsquo;t. He doesnt know if his cock would grow back, but it would painful either way. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t look up as the door behind him slams open. He assumes it&rsquo;s some of Master&rsquo;s friends here to play too. He closes his eyes and waits for more pain. </p><p>Except there&rsquo;s screaming now and Master isn&rsquo;t fucking him anymore and- what&rsquo;s going on? He tend his head to the other side, looking at the intruder with an emotionless face. Oh, it&rsquo;s Mr, Stark. He must want a turn too. </p><p>Master told Peter all about how the boy is stupid. And useless. And a bother. And annoying. Peter knows now, thanks to Master, that he&rsquo;s only good for taking whatever Master wants to give him. And if Master wants to share Peter, Peter can&rsquo;t complain. At least he&rsquo;s being useful for once. </p><p>So Peter closes his eyes again and waits for Mr. Stark to rape him too. Peter thinks Master must have given him more drugs, because he passes out while waiting for it. </p><p>~</p><p>When Peter wakes again, he&rsquo;s in a bed he hasn&rsquo;t been in before. There&rsquo;s needles in his arms&mdash;they must be giving him more of that drug. He opens his eyes and frowns. This isn&rsquo;t Master&rsquo;s home. This is a hospital. </p><p>He looks to his left and sees May crying. Hey look, May is here. He missed her. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. This is just a hallucination. Caused by the drugs. It&rsquo;s happened before. </p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes again, he sees a man in a white coat. He&rsquo;s asking questions, but Peter just stares at his lips. He wonders when the man will rape him. He looks around, but he doesn&rsquo;t see his Master. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker. Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter turns his head to the man. Why is he asking that? He nods once, thinking he missed a direction and he&rsquo;s going to be punished now. </p><p>&ldquo;Good. The drug is almost completely out of your system, and you&rsquo;ve been rehydrated. Your Aunt is here, she&rsquo;s sleeping now. It&rsquo;s about 3 in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter frowns. Where&rsquo;s Master? He wants to ask. He hasn&rsquo;t spoken in&hellip; he doesn&rsquo;t know. He doesn&rsquo;t know if he can speak. </p><p>The man smiles sadly. &ldquo;I- uh&hellip; the man who was&hellip; holding you, he&rsquo;s in jail. He won&rsquo;t hurt you anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter frowns and looks at the ceiling. He&rsquo;s going to punish me. I want to see Master, I want to show him I wasn&rsquo;t bad, Peter thinks. Not that it matters, he&rsquo;ll be punished anyway. </p><p>The man sighs. &ldquo;Good night, Mr. Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>He wakes about 7 hours later, based off the clock on the wall. He turns his head and sees Mr. Stark. He tears up. He wishes this were real. </p><p>Tony looks up and smiles sadly at him. &ldquo;Hey, Underoos. How ya feelin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shakes his head, looking away. It isn&rsquo;t real. It isn&rsquo;t real. If you let it give you hope, you&rsquo;ll be hurt again. </p><p>Tony frowns. &ldquo;They said you were pretty unresponsive. But you can hear?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods slightly. He shouldn&rsquo;t have, but he did. </p><p>Tony hums softly. &ldquo;That drug he made you take really took a lot out of you. They say you&rsquo;ll be able to speak, still. It&rsquo;s a mental thing, they say.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t look at Tony. </p><p>Tony sighs. &ldquo;Your Aunt will be here soon. She&rsquo;s still sleeping. She hadn&rsquo;t left your bed for a week.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks at him at that. A week? He&rsquo;s been here a week? But&hellip; </p><p>Tony smiles at him, looking pleased Peter is looking at him. &ldquo;You were gone for 6 months, kid. The police had given up, but not me. I kept looking.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter feels a tear fall down his face. This is real. It has to be. He had given up hope Tony was looking for him a long time ago. This isn&rsquo;t a dream. It&rsquo;s real. </p><p>Tony smiles more. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. You can cry. That man won&rsquo;t hurt you anymore. He can&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s too busy sitting in jail.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter closes his eyes, breath hitching. &ldquo;Mr. Stark&hellip;&rdquo; he whispers. He hasn&rsquo;t spoken in 6 months. It&rsquo;s so overwhelming, hearing his own voice. </p><p>Peter sleeps. </p><p>~</p><p>A year later, and Peter is still not normal again. His therapist says he never will be. He never speaks, not to his therapist or to May or to MJ or Ned. He can say some things to Mr. Stark, but talking overwhelms him. </p><p>He&rsquo;s never alone. He can&rsquo;t use the bathroom without at least one person there for him to watch. Just in case he gets kidnapped again. He can&rsquo;t shower alone; something Ned and MJ mostly help with. Peter had thought it would be awkward, but it wasn&rsquo;t. Not to him at least. He was used to people watching him, used to people touching him in ways he wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with. </p><p>He&rsquo;s accidentally gotten three teachers at his school fired. </p><p>One raised his voice at Peter and said he would never be good for anything. Peter had panicked and just nodded, turning around and pulling his pants down. He&rsquo;s used to &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll never be good for anything&rsquo; to be followed by rape or torture. </p><p>One had actually raped Peter, knowing the boy wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say no. MJ had caught them. Peter had tried to say he was sorry, but he couldn&rsquo;t get his mouth to work, and MJ didn&rsquo;t seem mad at him anyway. </p><p>The last one he accidentally got fired was a girl teacher. She had hugged him, overwhelmed with want to comfort him. He had exposed his neck, waiting for the drugs to come. He tried to tell Ned that she hadn&rsquo;t touched him, but he couldn&rsquo;t make himself speak. </p><p>Flash did a complete 180. After what happened with Ms. White, he refused to let Peter go anywhere without him. Not to the bathroom, not to class, not to the bus. He drove Peter to and from school, now, do it isn&rsquo;t like he needed to go to the bus anyway. </p><p>Peter wants to say thank you, but the best he can do is write it down. Flash seems to know anyways. </p><p>When he isn&rsquo;t with his friends or May, he&rsquo;s with Tony. Tony is the only one that doesn&rsquo;t treat him any differently. He acts as if it never happened. </p><p>Peter wishes he knew if that was for his sake or Tony&rsquo;s, but he doesn&rsquo;t think it matters anyway. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t sleep alone. At first, he slept on May&rsquo;s floor. He was used to being on the floor. But he kept having nightmares and waking her up, so he tried to sleep outside her door instead. </p><p>When that didn&rsquo;t help, Mr. Stark started sleeping in Peter&rsquo;s bed. Peter was scared at first, but Tony never touched him. He stayed on his side of the bed and didn&rsquo;t move. </p><p>Peter eventually got used to it, but he still feels bad for waking Mr, Stark up with his nightmares. </p><p>~</p><p>Five years after the accident, and Peter is as close to normal as he&rsquo;ll ever be. He speaks, now, although not as much as before. He can shower and use the bathroom alone. He has his college set up so Flash can always give him a ride, and Ned is always sitting next to him. </p><p>He&rsquo;s learned to not feel guilty for these things. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t sleep alone, so Mr. Stark keeps him company at night. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t ever be alone. He always has Flash, MJ, Ned, Tony, or May with him. One or more, at all times. </p><p>He&rsquo;s Spider-Man again, too. Although his man in the chair is always on the phone with him; that or Mr. Stark is patrolling with him. </p><p>He isn&rsquo;t the best superhero, but he&rsquo;s doing something at least. </p><p>~</p><p>After his college graduation, he goes to work for SI. He invents things, makes things, and he&rsquo;s always with Tony. He moved in with Tony a long time ago, because May deserved her space. He sees his friends every day; Ned is even his coworker. </p><p>Mr. Stark saved him, not just the night he found Peter; but throughout all these years too. He hasn&rsquo;t given up on Peter. He never gave up on Peter. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; He whispers one night. It&rsquo;s late, and Tony is scrolling on his Stark pad. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; He asks. He always gets excited when Peter talks to him. Even though he has been for a long time. </p><p>Peter swallows thickly. &ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; He asks. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s smile fades. He never pretended he was Peter&rsquo;s boyfriend. He never kissed him, never acted possessive. He can&rsquo;t help but wonder what he did wrong&hellip; &ldquo;No, Peter, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter tears up but nods, turning back over. He thought it was a good idea. Tony took care of him, slept in his bed, did everything from him. He didn&rsquo;t think anything would change from how it is now. He must have been wrong. He&rsquo;s too damaged for Mr. Stark to ever want him. Tony helps because he feels pity for Peter, that&rsquo;s all. </p><p>Tony sighs and takes Peter&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not having sex with you Peter, I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods and doesn&rsquo;t look at Tony. He stands and goes to the living room without a word. </p><p>Tony sighs and follows him. Peter can&rsquo;t sleep alone. &ldquo;Come back to bed Peter, please. You need sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shakes his head and grabs a glass of whiskey. It&rsquo;s become his favorite, even though Tony disapproves. </p><p>Tony sighs. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe me Peter. You don&rsquo;t have to pay me back.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter turns to him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pay you back. I want to marry you because I trust you not to hurt me. I trust you to take care of me. I trust you not to rape me.&rdquo; He pauses as Tony flinched, but keeps going. &ldquo;I trust you, and I love you, and I want to be married to you because of that. Not because I owe you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony feels his own tears fall down his face. He nods slowly, clearing histhroat. &ldquo;As long as you don&rsquo;t feel like you owe me.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>Their wedding is perfect. It&rsquo;s beautiful and he&rsquo;s beautiful, and Tony is the luckiest bastard ever. </p><p>When they get to the honeymoon destination, Tony doesn&rsquo;t let Peter Touch him. He just smiles and kisses Peter&rsquo;s forehead, pulling him to bed. &ldquo;Sleep, baby. I&rsquo;m your husband, I&rsquo;ll protect you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter tears up, and for the first time in years, it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s happy. So he nods and kisses Tony&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p>And Peter sleeps.  </p>",
