The design and the family&rsquo;s story caught the Sharks&rsquo; eyes and all five invested in the product.</p><p>After filming the show, the Young family, Williams Sonoma, and Wisconsin-based kitchen tool manufacturer Epicurean teamed up to refine the product and bring it to the masses. Today, the Cup Board Pros is available for purchase in stores and on Williams Sonoma&rsquo;s website. Read more about the Young&rsquo;s story and see their genius product below. It&rsquo;s made of a durable wood-fiber material and has a detachable silicone tray to gather food scraps, plus a perimeter groove to move liquid and juices into tray.</p><ul></ul><p><strong>ORIGINAL POST: October 25, 2018 at 12:41 p.m.</strong></p><p>The Sharks on <em><a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/g22863579/bantam-bagels-egg-bites/\" target=\"_blank\">Shark Tank</a></em> can be pretty tough at times - there&rsquo;s usually a great deal of money at stake, after all.  Sometimes, though, there are particularly moving pitches that cause an unusually emotional response from the investors. During a recent episode, tears were shed in the first few minutes of the pitch.<br/></p><p>A group of three siblings, Kaley, Christian, and Keira Young, arrived to the tank ready to pitch the <a href=\"https://firehousechefky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cup Board Pro</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/a23309950/how-to-cut-onion/\" target=\"_blank\">cutting board</a> with a bowl for scraps attached, made for easy clean-up. Though the young entrepreneurs were clearly passionate about the boards, the invention was actually created by their late father, Keith Young. Keith, a New York City firefighter, passed away from a &ldquo;9-11-related cancer from being a fireman there,&rdquo; his daughter told the Sharks. Even more heart-wrenching - he passed just three months before the taping of the program.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1440\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-src=\"https://media.zenfs.com/en/woman_s_day_132/b90159ab5743eaf09258dd4c16a26e01\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/caead8e7bf3e2e79f8fde1bc91aa7760/tumblr_inline_pr7tshNu7G1tm6deu_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1440\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-src=\"https://media.zenfs.com/en/woman_s_day_132/b90159ab5743eaf09258dd4c16a26e01\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Our dad invented the Cup Board Pro, and it was his dream to pitch it on Shark Tank,&rdquo; Kaley says in the episode. &ldquo;Unfortunately, he passed away before he had that chance. We&rsquo;re here today to continue his legacy and make that dream a reality.&rdquo;  </p><p>The Young family shows the Sharks Keith&rsquo;s audition video, during which he reveals that he was a widower. Kaley explains that their mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and passed in 2012. In their father&rsquo;s audition video, it&rsquo;s clear the passion he had for the Cup Board Pro, and the love and dedication he had for his children. </p><p>Kaley told the Sharks that the siblings had sold 300 Cup Board Pros in just three weeks. The emotional Sharks were impressed, and Daymond John asked the siblings to step out of the room for a moment. When they came back in, an amazing offer was waiting for them. </p><div class=\"fb-video\"></div><p> According to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/10/22/shark-tank-dream-pitch-9-11-firefighter-cup-board-pro/1676780002/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>USA Today</em></a>, John, Mark Cuban, Lori Greiner, Matt Higgins, and Kevin O'Leary came together to offer $100,000 for a 20 percent stake in Cup Board Pro. To top things off, they made a special promise - to donate profits to a charity which helps firefighters that were affected on 9/11, just as the siblings&rsquo; father was. </p><p>John tweeted on Sunday (after the episode aired) that the Cup Board Pro had already sold out. According to Sony Pictures Television, they sold over $1 million in sales over just 18 hours, and it&rsquo;s still sold out on Amazon. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Wow, the response to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CupboardPro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CupboardPro</a> has been so good that they\u2019ve sold out of product. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SharkTank?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SharkTank</a> fans - if you want to support the Young family, donate to their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoFundMe?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoFundMe</a> in honor of the FDNY. <a href=\"https://t.co/Gh2LTzsXt1\">https://t.co/Gh2LTzsXt1</a></p>- Daymond John (@TheSharkDaymond) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheSharkDaymond/status/1054190796478521344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 22, 2018</a></blockquote><p>You can sign up to be notified when the Cup Board Pro is back in stock on <a href=\"https://firehousechefky.com/products/cup-board-pro\" target=\"_blank\">the website.</a> Also, you can join the Young kids in supporting the FDNY Foundation&rsquo;s Fired Up for a Cure, by donating to the <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/young-kids-support-fdny-foundation\" target=\"_blank\">GoFundMe page</a> they created.  </p><p>What a cool family!

Stern said that while he was in contact with the president during the election \u2014 and Stern admitted, despite being a Hillary Clinton supporter, he thought she would have a hard time beating Trump \u2014 he really hasn\u2019t spoken to him since a congratulatory exchange when Trump won in 2016.</p><p>&quot;It was a difficult thing because there&rsquo;s a part of me that really likes Donald, but I just don&rsquo;t agree politically,&rdquo; Stern said. Though, he quipped, &ldquo;A more self-serving person would have gone all in on Donald because I&rsquo;d probably be the FCC commissioner or a Supreme Court justice by now.&rdquo;</p><p><em><strong>Howard Stern Comes Again</strong></em><strong> comes out on May 14.

His contract with SiriusXM, which reportedly pays him $90 million a year, expires at the end of 2020.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at a place now where I am trying to figure out how to spend the rest of my life, however long that might be,\u201d he told <em>THR</em>. Though, he admitted, \u201cIt seems weird to me not to have this [show].\u201d</p><p>In addition to discussing the cancer scare with <em>THR</em>, Stern also talked about his relationship with Donald Trump, who for years called into his show or dropped by. Stern said that while he was in contact with the president during the election \u2014 and Stern admitted, despite being a Hillary Clinton supporter, he thought she would have a hard time beating Trump \u2014 he really hasn\u2019t spoken to him since a congratulatory exchange when Trump won in 2016.</p><p>\"It was a difficult thing because there\u2019s a part of me that really likes Donald, but I just don\u2019t agree politically,\u201d Stern said. Though, he quipped, \u201cA more self-serving person would have gone all in on Donald because I\u2019d probably be the FCC commissioner or a Supreme Court justice by now.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Howard Stern Comes Again</strong></em><strong> comes out on May 14.
