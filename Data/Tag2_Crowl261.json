Nobody said anything, nobody made a sound\neven.</p><p>\nThe enormity of what had just happened hit you harshly. Not only\ncould you do nothing about Amara right now, you couldn&rsquo;t even trap\nLucifer. If you couldn&rsquo;t even trap Lucifer, what hope in hell did you\nhave of stopping Amara from ripping the world apart?</p><p>\nNever had you felt true despair. Even in the times you almost died\nyou had hope. Now you had nothing to cling onto, just an impending\nsense of dread. This was it, this was the endgame and you&rsquo;d just\nshown your best hand and lost.</p><p>\nYou felt Crowley&rsquo;s fingers dig a little into your skin, obviously\nlistening in to your desperate thoughts but you didn&rsquo;t care. What did\nit matter any more? \n</p><p>\n\u201cWe could just drive,\u201d Dean says quietly. \u201cAnywhere. Let&rsquo;s go\nto the mountains and watch the sunset or something. Last night on\nearth barbecue.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDean, we&hellip;.\u201d Sam trails off but he knows he can&rsquo;t offer\nanything helpful. \u201cWe need to fight this to the end.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy, Sammy?\u201d Dean turns around, unclipping his seatbelt. \u201cWe\nlost. We lost big time. The power of God wasn&rsquo;t enough to smite her,\nCas is completely gone to us. We got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, tell him,\u201d Sam says.</p><p>\nOne look at Crowley&rsquo;s firm set jaw and that told you enough. You&rsquo;d\nnever seen him look so grim.</p><p>\n\u201cI can&rsquo;t, Sam. I can&rsquo;t. Dean is&hellip;.right,\u201d Crowley sighs. \u201cWe\nare absolutely blind, powerless and the only thing we could possibly\nexploit is Amara&rsquo;s interest in Tabitha and Dean but that still leaves\nLucifer as a problem. We are caught between a rock and a hard place,\nI believe the expression is.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo none of you have anything? Any ideas?\u201d Sam&rsquo;s face becomes\ncrestfallen.</p><p>\n\u201cFace it, Sammy. We just gotta make the most of the time we have\nleft,\u201d Dean sighs, wrenching his necklace over his head and\nthrowing it with disdain into the back seat. \u201cNobody is gonna help\nus now.\u201d</p><p>\nYou pick the necklace up from the floor, tracing your fingers over\nthe strange design. It&rsquo;s well worn but also well loved.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you ask quietly, your mind completely distracted.</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s supposed to be linked to God,\u201d Dean scoffs bitterly. \u201cShow\nme when he&rsquo;s close, you know? God is a douchebag though and he\ndoesn&rsquo;t give a damn about anyone. Coward.\u201d</p><p>\nYou couldn&rsquo;t believe such a tiny object was supposed to have that\nmuch power. It was so delicate, so unassuming.</p><p>\nYou took what Dean had said and you did something quite ridiculous,\nsomething you&rsquo;d not done since you were a small girl. You prayed to God.</p><p><i>I\nknow you probably aren&rsquo;t listening, you might not even care but The\nDarkness will consume the world and I&rsquo;m afraid. If you&rsquo;re out there,\nplease help us. Please help them.</i></p><p>\nYou didn&rsquo;t expect anything to happen. It was just a silent offering\nto calm your brain. So when the pendant started glowing, you just\nabout almost choked on your own breath.</p><p>\n\u201cGuys!\u201d you started flapping your arms like a hyperactive child.\n\u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>\nYou watch as three sets of eyes completely widen on the necklace.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d Dean demands. \u201cIt&rsquo;s never done that!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI prayed,\u201d you admit. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWell God must be into some feminist crap because he&rsquo;s never\nanswered when I&rsquo;ve prayed,\u201d Dean scowls before taking the necklace\nback and scrambling out of the Impala.</p><p>\nIn fact you all do. You hop next to Dean, staring as he turns this\nway and that with it, the pendant glowing bright and dim with each\nsweep. You take it from him when he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be getting it.</p><p>\nIt&rsquo;s like a compass and the brighter it glows, that&rsquo;s the direction\nyou need to go. You follow the line, wending in and out of the street\nuntil you hit the main street and see a man helping up some\npedestrians who&rsquo;d fallen into the road.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha!\u201d Crowley calls, trying to keep up as he manages to put\none hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\nDean and Sam follow, just staring into the street, trying to decipher\nwhat it meant.</p><p>\n\u201cThat&rsquo;s him,\u201d you almost whisper. \u201cThe light is almost\nblinding. That&rsquo;s God.\u201d</p><p>\nYou walk without thinking, purpose true in your mind as you reach the\nman with his back turned and stop, your heart hammering wildly.</p><p>\n\u201cHello. Tabitha isn&rsquo;t it?\u201d he turns around.</p><p>\nGod is not what you expected. You don&rsquo;t know why you had this image\nin your head of an elderly man with white hair but the young dorky\nlooking man with curly hair and hipster chic was not in the slightest\nwhat you imagined.</p><p>\n\u201cYou don&rsquo;t often go by your real name any more. I find that fun,\nyou&rsquo;ve forged your own way in life,\u201d he continues talking.</p><p>\n\u201cChuck?!\u201d comes the voice of Sam.</p><p>\n\u201cOh no way,\u201d Dean stammers.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you turn around to them, confused.</p><p>\n\u201cOh, you weren&rsquo;t here when they met me before, I&rsquo;m God but you can\ncall me Chuck. Hey we&rsquo;re kinda the same in that regard with names and\nall,\u201d Chuck extends his hand.</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re shaking hands with God. You&rsquo;re sure your mind couldn&rsquo;t take\nthat much more amazement.</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ve been writing their gospel for some time now, The\nWinchesters,\u201d Chuck explains. \u201cThey met me many years ago. Didn&rsquo;t\nI boys?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah thanks for those lasting words, man,\u201d Dean frowns. \u201cI&rsquo;ll\nnever be able to get &lsquo;Wincest&rsquo; outta my head. Internet, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s just people having fun,\u201d Chuck smiles. \u201cNow, you prayed\nto me, didn&rsquo;t you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI didn&rsquo;t expect you to hear,\u201d you admit.</p><p>\n\u201cCome on, let&rsquo;s talk somewhere more familiar,\u201d Chuck nods.</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\nIt felt very strange being in the bunker with God. \n</p><p>\nCrowley hadn&rsquo;t said a single word and you wonder if he was\nfrightened. After all, he was a being who&rsquo;d turned from God&rsquo;s light\ntechnically.</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re not buying this are you, Dean?\u201d Chuck notes Dean&rsquo;s sour\nface. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThat you&hellip;you are God? Nah,\u201d Dean shakes his head. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMaybe you&rsquo;ll believe it better from my former prophet,\u201d Chuck\nwaves his hand.</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a curtain of light that drops from the ceiling and shimmers\nbefore it draws back to reveal&hellip;.</p><p>\n\u201cKevin!\u201d you gasp.</p><p>\nKevin Tran. That sweet little boy you looked after, that sweet little\nboy that you burned on a funeral pyre.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha,\u201d he grins.</p><p>\nYou don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s only an illusion, you walk forward and attempt\nto hug him. When you make contact with solid flesh, your composure\ndissolves and you draw him into a tight hug.</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry,\u201d you whisper against him. \u201cI should&rsquo;ve protected\nyou better.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t blame you at all,\u201d Kevin tells you. \u201cYou did\neverything you could. Please don&rsquo;t torture yourself any more,\nTabitha. You know what my Heaven was?\u201d</p><p>\nYou pull back looking into his placid face, a face you&rsquo;ve only seen a\ncouple of times on him in real life.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou, me and Dean,\u201d he smiles warmly. \u201cWhen you made me dinner.\nWhen we just talked and laughed like a normal&hellip;..family would.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cKid you&rsquo;re gonna make me cry,\u201d Dean hides his mouth with his\nhand, looking to the ceiling. \n</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re already crying. You were done being the stalwart one of the\ngroup. You were just so happy to see him again, to know that he was\nalright and he was in a better place.</p><p>\n\u201cTrust Chuck, Tabitha, Dean, everybody,\u201d Kevin announces. \u201cEven\nyou Crowley. I&rsquo;ve watched you and Tabitha&rsquo;s made you bearable now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo hard feelings then?\u201d Crowley asks, his hands dug into the\npockets of his overcoat.</p><p>\n\u201cNah,\u201d Kevin laughs. \u201cYou got your karma in the end. The books\nare balanced.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat&rsquo;s very&hellip;.magnanimous of you,\u201d Crowley ponders.</p><p>\n\u201cHe&rsquo;s a good soul,\u201d Chuck smiles. \u201cI think you&rsquo;ve earned a\nlittle extra something, Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\nHe waves his hand and Kevin is enveloped in pure light before he\nfades out of existence, only swirling specks like tiny fireflies left\nin his wake. You knew what had happened. He&rsquo;d truly been laid to rest\nnow, a private corner of Heaven reserved for only the most pious.\nYou&rsquo;d heard that is was possible.</p><p>\nYou just let your hands float through the dancing lights, the last\nmemory you&rsquo;ll have of Kevin before turning to see Sam looking excited\nbeyond belief, Crowley looking completely stunned and Dean&hellip;..Dean\nlooked livid.</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re angry at me, aren&rsquo;t you?\u201d Chuck sighs.</p><p>\n\u201cDamn straight I am,\u201d Dean hisses. \u201cWhere the hell were you?! I\ncalled for you so many times. <i>Everyone&rsquo;s</i> called for you so\nmany damn times. Did you just get busy during the World Wars? The\nPlague?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI tried being hands on, okay?\u201d Chuck holds up his hands. \u201cOld\nTestament remember? Didn&rsquo;t work out so well. I just left you guys to\nit and you&rsquo;ve done better than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Dean says in a voice that&rsquo;s bordering on dangerous.\n\u201cWars? Biochemical weapons? Murders? Rapes? None of that is\n<i>better</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut you have music and art and dance,\u201d Chuck smiles almost\ndeliriously. \u201cAnd that&rsquo;s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s bullcrap!\u201d Dean roars. \u201cYou&rsquo;re just making excuses for\nabandoning us!\u201d</p><p>\nYou see the subtle change in Chuck, a change that reminds you <i>exactly</i>\nhow much power he held. The smile faded, the posture stiffened and\nthe eyes darkened. You felt afraid in that instant.</p><p>\n\u201cDon&rsquo;t project your Daddy issues on me, Dean,\u201d Chuck says\nsternly. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI-\u201d Dean begins but you cut him off.</p><p>\n\u201cCan you help us? What I asked of you?\u201d you interrupt.</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t get involved,\u201d Chuck falls back into that sweet and\nkinda goofy stance. \u201cBut I have faith in you guys.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d you blink. \u201cThen why did you answer my prayer at\nall?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI felt like you needed a boost,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cSomething to\nmotivate you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBy just leaving us to it?\u201d you clarify. \u201cYou think you showing\nup and doing absolutely jack shit is going to motivate us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh of course!\u201d Chuck slaps his palm to his head. \u201cYou can&rsquo;t do\nmuch in your state can you? You&rsquo;re technically dying.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe&rsquo;s what?!\u201d Crowley steps forward.</p><p>\n\u201cHumans can&rsquo;t carry the children of demons, Crowley. You should\nknow that,\u201d Chuck chides. \n</p><p>\n\u201cSome make it,\u201d Crowley tries to argue.</p><p>\n\u201cBut Tabitha is not one of them,\u201d Chuck turns his gaze to you.\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re not destined to survive this child. You would&rsquo;ve survived\nif you&rsquo;d actually carried <i>Lucifer&rsquo;s</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo chance in Hell I&rsquo;d ever carry Lucifer&rsquo;s child,\u201d you say\nangrily. \u201cThis is just to save me from him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMy son is&hellip;.erratic,\u201d Chuck pats at his unruly hair. \u201cI\napologise he&rsquo;s so fixated on you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen do something!\u201d Crowley demands, bristling with rage.\n\u201cBefore he turns her into a broodmare.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTold you, I&rsquo;m hands off now,\u201d Chuck says nonchalantly. \u201cYou\nguys are smart. It&rsquo;ll work out.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSome help you are. You&rsquo;re just useless,\u201d Dean snarls.</p><p>\n\u201cFine, you want me to help?\u201d Chuck gets irate again before slamming\nhis palm on your stomach and there&rsquo;s a hot sensation before the light\nin his hand burns out. \u201cThere, I helped. Go team Free Will right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d you ask in shock. \u201cWhat did you do to me?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSaved you,\u201d Chuck answers shortly. \u201cNow you have a chance at\nlife so use it well against Amara.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDid you just kill my child?\u201d Crowley gapes in absolute horror.\n\u201cDid you&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s a mercy,\u201d Chuck smiles sweetly. \u201cWould you rather have\nyour child or Tabitha?\u201d</p><p>\nYou felt like there should be some&hellip;empty feeling. Some fan fare.\nAnything that would indicate that God had just made your growing\nchild disappear in an instant. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThat was not your choice to make,\u201d you say, absolutely maddened\nbeyond belief. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBut you would&rsquo;ve died?\u201d Chuck says puzzled. \u201cYou should be\nthanking me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut you&rsquo;ve just given Lucifer licence to try and get me again,\u201d\nyour voice starts shaking, the pitch going in and out as you try and\ncontrol the fire burning in your heart. \u201cYou&rsquo;ve just given him even\nmore reason to be angry at you because he thought that it was <i>his</i>\nchild.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLike I haven&rsquo;t ever handled people being disappointed in me,\u201d\nChuck gives you a reproachful look.</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re not sure what on earth possessed you to lose your damn mind.\nYou think all the stress had just gotten to you. You just walked up\nand punched Chuck straight in the face.</p><p>\n\u201cYou selfish arsehole!\u201d you yell, putting your full power into\nit.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you&hellip;are you kidding me right now?\u201d Chuck blinks, touching\nhis face.</p><p>\n\u201cShe just punched God,\u201d Dean looks starstruck.\u201dBoy what a turn\non.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDean,\u201d Sam says, half scowling, half apprehensive.</p><p>\nCrowley just comes behind you, silently wrapping you up in a hug. His\ngrip is crushing and he buries his face in your hair. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry,\u201d is all he whispers and it breaks your heart to\nhear the defeat and grief in his voice.</p><p>\nYou knew how much that child meant to him. Perhaps he would&rsquo;ve told\nyou to abort it had he known it would kill you but to have that\nchoice ripped away from you both&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>\n\u201cGo to bed, the lot of you,\u201d Chuck just snaps his fingers, a dark look on his face.</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\nYou wake up in your own bed, the beat up alarm clock registering that\nis was eight in the morning. \n</p><p>\nYou have no memory of getting there and it was the afternoon when you\nlast remember speaking to anyone. How had so much time passed?</p><p>\nYou feel someone stir next to you and Crowley jerks up, reaching\nblindly for you. You meet him half way and he just bundles you into\nhis chest.</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t\nknow it would kill you. Forgive me, kitten.\u201d</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s an odd shaking sensation and you realise he&rsquo;s crying as he\nholds you tightly. You&rsquo;ve never know him to do that. \n</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\u201d you say gently, reaching up and wiping the tears away from\nhis overgrown beard. \u201cIt&rsquo;s alright. You didn&rsquo;t know. We couldn&rsquo;t\npossibly have known.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAll I did was hand you a death sentence when I thought I was\nsaving you. I&rsquo;m reprehensible,\u201d Crowley continues, his voice thick\nand heavy from the sorrow.</p><p>\n\u201cAt least you tried to save me,\u201d you kiss the underside of his\njaw. \u201cAnd I&rsquo;m sorry. I know you wanted this.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNothing is worth your life, darling,\u201d Crowley says seriously.\n\u201cIf I am to remain childless for the rest of my cursed life then so\nbe it. You are all I want. The action of it though&hellip;.it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh Crowley,\u201d you kiss him gently, trying to soothe him.</p><p>\nNever had the King of Hell opened up this much to you since he&rsquo;d been\ndosed with human blood. He was completely raw, exposed, all for you.</p><p>\n\u201cPlease&hellip;..please darling. Tell me you love me,\u201d he seems\nuncharacteristically subservient.</p><p>\n\u201cI love you,\u201d you say with utter conviction.</p><p>\nYou just remain like that for a while, soft kisses, caresses with no\nsexual intention, just a contentment to be close.</p><p>\nYou end up drifting off again.</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n\u201cBear witness my chosen,\u201d Amara smiles at you and Dean. \u201cMy\nbrother has finally come out of hiding I see. Took him long enough.\u201d</p><p>\nYou say nothing. The last thing you needed her knowing was that\nGod&hellip;Chuck was here but he wasn&rsquo;t even willing to lift a finger to\nhelp. \n</p><p>\n\u201cSo I&rsquo;m just making thing clear,\u201d Amara continues, stepping to\nthe side to reveal Castiel/Lucifer in chains, badly beaten and\nbleeding. \u201cThis one doesn&rsquo;t have much time left&hellip;the archangel <i>or</i>\nthe angel. So if God <i>does</i> contact you. I want to know. Are we\nat an understanding?\u201d</p><p>\nYou and Dean just exchange horrified glances before turning back and\nnodding.</p><p>\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d she smiles broadly. \u00a0\u201cNow, time to wake up my\nchosen. You&rsquo;ve got some God hunting to do.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Permanent tags:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a></p>",

Nobody said anything, nobody made a sound\neven.</p><p>\nThe enormity of what had just happened hit you harshly. Not only\ncould you do nothing about Amara right now, you couldn\u2019t even trap\nLucifer. If you couldn\u2019t even trap Lucifer, what hope in hell did you\nhave of stopping Amara from ripping the world apart?</p><p>\nNever had you felt true despair. Even in the times you almost died\nyou had hope. Now you had nothing to cling onto, just an impending\nsense of dread. This was it, this was the endgame and you\u2019d just\nshown your best hand and lost.</p><p>\nYou felt Crowley\u2019s fingers dig a little into your skin, obviously\nlistening in to your desperate thoughts but you didn\u2019t care. What did\nit matter any more? \n</p><p>\n\u201cWe could just drive,\u201d Dean says quietly. \u201cAnywhere. Let\u2019s go\nto the mountains and watch the sunset or something. Last night on\nearth barbecue.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDean, we\u2026.\u201d Sam trails off but he knows he can\u2019t offer\nanything helpful. \u201cWe need to fight this to the end.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy, Sammy?\u201d Dean turns around, unclipping his seatbelt. \u201cWe\nlost. We lost big time. The power of God wasn\u2019t enough to smite her,\nCas is completely gone to us. We got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, tell him,\u201d Sam says.</p><p>\nOne look at Crowley\u2019s firm set jaw and that told you enough. You\u2019d\nnever seen him look so grim.</p><p>\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Sam. I can\u2019t. Dean is\u2026.right,\u201d Crowley sighs. \u201cWe\nare absolutely blind, powerless and the only thing we could possibly\nexploit is Amara\u2019s interest in Tabitha and Dean but that still leaves\nLucifer as a problem. We are caught between a rock and a hard place,\nI believe the expression is.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo none of you have anything? Any ideas?\u201d Sam\u2019s face becomes\ncrestfallen.</p><p>\n\u201cFace it, Sammy. We just gotta make the most of the time we have\nleft,\u201d Dean sighs, wrenching his necklace over his head and\nthrowing it with disdain into the back seat. \u201cNobody is gonna help\nus now.\u201d</p><p>\nYou pick the necklace up from the floor, tracing your fingers over\nthe strange design. It\u2019s well worn but also well loved.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you ask quietly, your mind completely distracted.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be linked to God,\u201d Dean scoffs bitterly. \u201cShow\nme when he\u2019s close, you know? God is a douchebag though and he\ndoesn\u2019t give a damn about anyone. Coward.\u201d</p><p>\nYou couldn\u2019t believe such a tiny object was supposed to have that\nmuch power. It was so delicate, so unassuming.</p><p>\nYou took what Dean had said and you did something quite ridiculous,\nsomething you\u2019d not done since you were a small girl. You prayed to God.</p><p><i>I\nknow you probably aren\u2019t listening, you might not even care but The\nDarkness will consume the world and I\u2019m afraid. If you\u2019re out there,\nplease help us. Please help them.</i></p><p>\nYou didn\u2019t expect anything to happen. It was just a silent offering\nto calm your brain. So when the pendant started glowing, you just\nabout almost choked on your own breath.</p><p>\n\u201cGuys!\u201d you started flapping your arms like a hyperactive child.\n\u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>\nYou watch as three sets of eyes completely widen on the necklace.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d Dean demands. \u201cIt\u2019s never done that!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI prayed,\u201d you admit. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWell God must be into some feminist crap because he\u2019s never\nanswered when I\u2019ve prayed,\u201d Dean scowls before taking the necklace\nback and scrambling out of the Impala.</p><p>\nIn fact you all do. You hop next to Dean, staring as he turns this\nway and that with it, the pendant glowing bright and dim with each\nsweep. You take it from him when he doesn\u2019t seem to be getting it.</p><p>\nIt\u2019s like a compass and the brighter it glows, that\u2019s the direction\nyou need to go. You follow the line, wending in and out of the street\nuntil you hit the main street and see a man helping up some\npedestrians who\u2019d fallen into the road.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha!\u201d Crowley calls, trying to keep up as he manages to put\none hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\nDean and Sam follow, just staring into the street, trying to decipher\nwhat it meant.</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d you almost whisper. \u201cThe light is almost\nblinding. That\u2019s God.\u201d</p><p>\nYou walk without thinking, purpose true in your mind as you reach the\nman with his back turned and stop, your heart hammering wildly.</p><p>\n\u201cHello. Tabitha isn\u2019t it?\u201d he turns around.</p><p>\nGod is not what you expected. You don\u2019t know why you had this image\nin your head of an elderly man with white hair but the young dorky\nlooking man with curly hair and hipster chic was not in the slightest\nwhat you imagined.</p><p>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t often go by your real name any more. I find that fun,\nyou\u2019ve forged your own way in life,\u201d he continues talking.</p><p>\n\u201cChuck?!\u201d comes the voice of Sam.</p><p>\n\u201cOh no way,\u201d Dean stammers.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you turn around to them, confused.</p><p>\n\u201cOh, you weren\u2019t here when they met me before, I\u2019m God but you can\ncall me Chuck. Hey we\u2019re kinda the same in that regard with names and\nall,\u201d Chuck extends his hand.</p><p>\nYou\u2019re shaking hands with God. You\u2019re sure your mind couldn\u2019t take\nthat much more amazement.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing their gospel for some time now, The\nWinchesters,\u201d Chuck explains. \u201cThey met me many years ago. Didn\u2019t\nI boys?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah thanks for those lasting words, man,\u201d Dean frowns. \u201cI\u2019ll\nnever be able to get \u2018Wincest\u2019 outta my head. Internet, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s just people having fun,\u201d Chuck smiles. \u201cNow, you prayed\nto me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to hear,\u201d you admit.</p><p>\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s talk somewhere more familiar,\u201d Chuck nods.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\nIt felt very strange being in the bunker with God. \n</p><p>\nCrowley hadn\u2019t said a single word and you wonder if he was\nfrightened. After all, he was a being who\u2019d turned from God\u2019s light\ntechnically.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re not buying this are you, Dean?\u201d Chuck notes Dean\u2019s sour\nface. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThat you\u2026you are God? Nah,\u201d Dean shakes his head. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll believe it better from my former prophet,\u201d Chuck\nwaves his hand.</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a curtain of light that drops from the ceiling and shimmers\nbefore it draws back to reveal\u2026.</p><p>\n\u201cKevin!\u201d you gasp.</p><p>\nKevin Tran. That sweet little boy you looked after, that sweet little\nboy that you burned on a funeral pyre.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha,\u201d he grins.</p><p>\nYou don\u2019t care if he\u2019s only an illusion, you walk forward and attempt\nto hug him. When you make contact with solid flesh, your composure\ndissolves and you draw him into a tight hug.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d you whisper against him. \u201cI should\u2019ve protected\nyou better.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you at all,\u201d Kevin tells you. \u201cYou did\neverything you could. Please don\u2019t torture yourself any more,\nTabitha. You know what my Heaven was?\u201d</p><p>\nYou pull back looking into his placid face, a face you\u2019ve only seen a\ncouple of times on him in real life.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou, me and Dean,\u201d he smiles warmly. \u201cWhen you made me dinner.\nWhen we just talked and laughed like a normal\u2026..family would.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cKid you\u2019re gonna make me cry,\u201d Dean hides his mouth with his\nhand, looking to the ceiling. \n</p><p>\nYou\u2019re already crying. You were done being the stalwart one of the\ngroup. You were just so happy to see him again, to know that he was\nalright and he was in a better place.</p><p>\n\u201cTrust Chuck, Tabitha, Dean, everybody,\u201d Kevin announces. \u201cEven\nyou Crowley. I\u2019ve watched you and Tabitha\u2019s made you bearable now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo hard feelings then?\u201d Crowley asks, his hands dug into the\npockets of his overcoat.</p><p>\n\u201cNah,\u201d Kevin laughs. \u201cYou got your karma in the end. The books\nare balanced.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s very\u2026.magnanimous of you,\u201d Crowley ponders.</p><p>\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good soul,\u201d Chuck smiles. \u201cI think you\u2019ve earned a\nlittle extra something, Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\nHe waves his hand and Kevin is enveloped in pure light before he\nfades out of existence, only swirling specks like tiny fireflies left\nin his wake. You knew what had happened. He\u2019d truly been laid to rest\nnow, a private corner of Heaven reserved for only the most pious.\nYou\u2019d heard that is was possible.</p><p>\nYou just let your hands float through the dancing lights, the last\nmemory you\u2019ll have of Kevin before turning to see Sam looking excited\nbeyond belief, Crowley looking completely stunned and Dean\u2026..Dean\nlooked livid.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re angry at me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Chuck sighs.</p><p>\n\u201cDamn straight I am,\u201d Dean hisses. \u201cWhere the hell were you?! I\ncalled for you so many times. <i>Everyone\u2019s</i> called for you so\nmany damn times. Did you just get busy during the World Wars? The\nPlague?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI tried being hands on, okay?\u201d Chuck holds up his hands. \u201cOld\nTestament remember? Didn\u2019t work out so well. I just left you guys to\nit and you\u2019ve done better than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Dean says in a voice that\u2019s bordering on dangerous.\n\u201cWars? Biochemical weapons? Murders? Rapes? None of that is\n<i>better</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut you have music and art and dance,\u201d Chuck smiles almost\ndeliriously. \u201cAnd that\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s bullcrap!\u201d Dean roars. \u201cYou\u2019re just making excuses for\nabandoning us!\u201d</p><p>\nYou see the subtle change in Chuck, a change that reminds you <i>exactly</i>\nhow much power he held. The smile faded, the posture stiffened and\nthe eyes darkened. You felt afraid in that instant.</p><p>\n\u201cDon\u2019t project your Daddy issues on me, Dean,\u201d Chuck says\nsternly. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI-\u201d Dean begins but you cut him off.</p><p>\n\u201cCan you help us? What I asked of you?\u201d you interrupt.</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t get involved,\u201d Chuck falls back into that sweet and\nkinda goofy stance. \u201cBut I have faith in you guys.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d you blink. \u201cThen why did you answer my prayer at\nall?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI felt like you needed a boost,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cSomething to\nmotivate you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBy just leaving us to it?\u201d you clarify. \u201cYou think you showing\nup and doing absolutely jack shit is going to motivate us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh of course!\u201d Chuck slaps his palm to his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t do\nmuch in your state can you? You\u2019re technically dying.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe\u2019s what?!\u201d Crowley steps forward.</p><p>\n\u201cHumans can\u2019t carry the children of demons, Crowley. You should\nknow that,\u201d Chuck chides. \n</p><p>\n\u201cSome make it,\u201d Crowley tries to argue.</p><p>\n\u201cBut Tabitha is not one of them,\u201d Chuck turns his gaze to you.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not destined to survive this child. You would\u2019ve survived\nif you\u2019d actually carried <i>Lucifer\u2019s</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo chance in Hell I\u2019d ever carry Lucifer\u2019s child,\u201d you say\nangrily. \u201cThis is just to save me from him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMy son is\u2026.erratic,\u201d Chuck pats at his unruly hair. \u201cI\napologise he\u2019s so fixated on you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen do something!\u201d Crowley demands, bristling with rage.\n\u201cBefore he turns her into a broodmare.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTold you, I\u2019m hands off now,\u201d Chuck says nonchalantly. \u201cYou\nguys are smart. It\u2019ll work out.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSome help you are. You\u2019re just useless,\u201d Dean snarls.</p><p>\n\u201cFine, you want me to help?\u201d Chuck gets irate again before slamming\nhis palm on your stomach and there\u2019s a hot sensation before the light\nin his hand burns out. \u201cThere, I helped. Go team Free Will right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d you ask in shock. \u201cWhat did you do to me?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSaved you,\u201d Chuck answers shortly. \u201cNow you have a chance at\nlife so use it well against Amara.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDid you just kill my child?\u201d Crowley gapes in absolute horror.\n\u201cDid you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mercy,\u201d Chuck smiles sweetly. \u201cWould you rather have\nyour child or Tabitha?\u201d</p><p>\nYou felt like there should be some\u2026empty feeling. Some fan fare.\nAnything that would indicate that God had just made your growing\nchild disappear in an instant. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThat was not your choice to make,\u201d you say, absolutely maddened\nbeyond belief. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBut you would\u2019ve died?\u201d Chuck says puzzled. \u201cYou should be\nthanking me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve just given Lucifer licence to try and get me again,\u201d\nyour voice starts shaking, the pitch going in and out as you try and\ncontrol the fire burning in your heart. \u201cYou\u2019ve just given him even\nmore reason to be angry at you because he thought that it was <i>his</i>\nchild.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLike I haven\u2019t ever handled people being disappointed in me,\u201d\nChuck gives you a reproachful look.</p><p>\nYou\u2019re not sure what on earth possessed you to lose your damn mind.\nYou think all the stress had just gotten to you. You just walked up\nand punched Chuck straight in the face.</p><p>\n\u201cYou selfish arsehole!\u201d you yell, putting your full power into\nit.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you\u2026are you kidding me right now?\u201d Chuck blinks, touching\nhis face.</p><p>\n\u201cShe just punched God,\u201d Dean looks starstruck.\u201dBoy what a turn\non.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDean,\u201d Sam says, half scowling, half apprehensive.</p><p>\nCrowley just comes behind you, silently wrapping you up in a hug. His\ngrip is crushing and he buries his face in your hair. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d is all he whispers and it breaks your heart to\nhear the defeat and grief in his voice.</p><p>\nYou knew how much that child meant to him. Perhaps he would\u2019ve told\nyou to abort it had he known it would kill you but to have that\nchoice ripped away from you both\u2026\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cGo to bed, the lot of you,\u201d Chuck just snaps his fingers, a dark look on his face.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\nYou wake up in your own bed, the beat up alarm clock registering that\nis was eight in the morning. \n</p><p>\nYou have no memory of getting there and it was the afternoon when you\nlast remember speaking to anyone. How had so much time passed?</p><p>\nYou feel someone stir next to you and Crowley jerks up, reaching\nblindly for you. You meet him half way and he just bundles you into\nhis chest.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t\nknow it would kill you. Forgive me, kitten.\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s an odd shaking sensation and you realise he\u2019s crying as he\nholds you tightly. You\u2019ve never know him to do that. \n</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\u201d you say gently, reaching up and wiping the tears away from\nhis overgrown beard. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You didn\u2019t know. We couldn\u2019t\npossibly have known.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAll I did was hand you a death sentence when I thought I was\nsaving you. I\u2019m reprehensible,\u201d Crowley continues, his voice thick\nand heavy from the sorrow.</p><p>\n\u201cAt least you tried to save me,\u201d you kiss the underside of his\njaw. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. I know you wanted this.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNothing is worth your life, darling,\u201d Crowley says seriously.\n\u201cIf I am to remain childless for the rest of my cursed life then so\nbe it. You are all I want. The action of it though\u2026.it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh Crowley,\u201d you kiss him gently, trying to soothe him.</p><p>\nNever had the King of Hell opened up this much to you since he\u2019d been\ndosed with human blood. He was completely raw, exposed, all for you.</p><p>\n\u201cPlease\u2026..please darling. Tell me you love me,\u201d he seems\nuncharacteristically subservient.</p><p>\n\u201cI love you,\u201d you say with utter conviction.</p><p>\nYou just remain like that for a while, soft kisses, caresses with no\nsexual intention, just a contentment to be close.</p><p>\nYou end up drifting off again.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n\u201cBear witness my chosen,\u201d Amara smiles at you and Dean. \u201cMy\nbrother has finally come out of hiding I see. Took him long enough.\u201d</p><p>\nYou say nothing. The last thing you needed her knowing was that\nGod\u2026Chuck was here but he wasn\u2019t even willing to lift a finger to\nhelp. \n</p><p>\n\u201cSo I\u2019m just making thing clear,\u201d Amara continues, stepping to\nthe side to reveal Castiel/Lucifer in chains, badly beaten and\nbleeding. \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t have much time left\u2026the archangel <i>or</i>\nthe angel. So if God <i>does</i> contact you. I want to know. Are we\nat an understanding?\u201d</p><p>\nYou and Dean just exchange horrified glances before turning back and\nnodding.</p><p>\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d she smiles broadly. \u00a0\u201cNow, time to wake up my\nchosen. You\u2019ve got some God hunting to do.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Permanent tags:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a></p></p>",

Nobody said anything, nobody made a sound\neven.</p><p>\nThe enormity of what had just happened hit you harshly. Not only\ncould you do nothing about Amara right now, you couldn\u2019t even trap\nLucifer. If you couldn\u2019t even trap Lucifer, what hope in hell did you\nhave of stopping Amara from ripping the world apart?</p><p>\nNever had you felt true despair. Even in the times you almost died\nyou had hope. Now you had nothing to cling onto, just an impending\nsense of dread. This was it, this was the endgame and you\u2019d just\nshown your best hand and lost.</p><p>\nYou felt Crowley\u2019s fingers dig a little into your skin, obviously\nlistening in to your desperate thoughts but you didn\u2019t care. What did\nit matter any more? \n</p><p>\n\u201cWe could just drive,\u201d Dean says quietly. \u201cAnywhere. Let\u2019s go\nto the mountains and watch the sunset or something. Last night on\nearth barbecue.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDean, we\u2026.\u201d Sam trails off but he knows he can\u2019t offer\nanything helpful. \u201cWe need to fight this to the end.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy, Sammy?\u201d Dean turns around, unclipping his seatbelt. \u201cWe\nlost. We lost big time. The power of God wasn\u2019t enough to smite her,\nCas is completely gone to us. We got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, tell him,\u201d Sam says.</p><p>\nOne look at Crowley\u2019s firm set jaw and that told you enough. You\u2019d\nnever seen him look so grim.</p><p>\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Sam. I can\u2019t. Dean is\u2026.right,\u201d Crowley sighs. \u201cWe\nare absolutely blind, powerless and the only thing we could possibly\nexploit is Amara\u2019s interest in Tabitha and Dean but that still leaves\nLucifer as a problem. We are caught between a rock and a hard place,\nI believe the expression is.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo none of you have anything? Any ideas?\u201d Sam\u2019s face becomes\ncrestfallen.</p><p>\n\u201cFace it, Sammy. We just gotta make the most of the time we have\nleft,\u201d Dean sighs, wrenching his necklace over his head and\nthrowing it with disdain into the back seat. \u201cNobody is gonna help\nus now.\u201d</p><p>\nYou pick the necklace up from the floor, tracing your fingers over\nthe strange design. It\u2019s well worn but also well loved.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you ask quietly, your mind completely distracted.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be linked to God,\u201d Dean scoffs bitterly. \u201cShow\nme when he\u2019s close, you know? God is a douchebag though and he\ndoesn\u2019t give a damn about anyone. Coward.\u201d</p><p>\nYou couldn\u2019t believe such a tiny object was supposed to have that\nmuch power. It was so delicate, so unassuming.</p><p>\nYou took what Dean had said and you did something quite ridiculous,\nsomething you\u2019d not done since you were a small girl. You prayed to God.</p><p><i>I\nknow you probably aren\u2019t listening, you might not even care but The\nDarkness will consume the world and I\u2019m afraid. If you\u2019re out there,\nplease help us. Please help them.</i></p><p>\nYou didn\u2019t expect anything to happen. It was just a silent offering\nto calm your brain. So when the pendant started glowing, you just\nabout almost choked on your own breath.</p><p>\n\u201cGuys!\u201d you started flapping your arms like a hyperactive child.\n\u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>\nYou watch as three sets of eyes completely widen on the necklace.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d Dean demands. \u201cIt\u2019s never done that!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI prayed,\u201d you admit. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWell God must be into some feminist crap because he\u2019s never\nanswered when I\u2019ve prayed,\u201d Dean scowls before taking the necklace\nback and scrambling out of the Impala.</p><p>\nIn fact you all do. You hop next to Dean, staring as he turns this\nway and that with it, the pendant glowing bright and dim with each\nsweep. You take it from him when he doesn\u2019t seem to be getting it.</p><p>\nIt\u2019s like a compass and the brighter it glows, that\u2019s the direction\nyou need to go. You follow the line, wending in and out of the street\nuntil you hit the main street and see a man helping up some\npedestrians who\u2019d fallen into the road.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha!\u201d Crowley calls, trying to keep up as he manages to put\none hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\nDean and Sam follow, just staring into the street, trying to decipher\nwhat it meant.</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d you almost whisper. \u201cThe light is almost\nblinding. That\u2019s God.\u201d</p><p>\nYou walk without thinking, purpose true in your mind as you reach the\nman with his back turned and stop, your heart hammering wildly.</p><p>\n\u201cHello. Tabitha isn\u2019t it?\u201d he turns around.</p><p>\nGod is not what you expected. You don\u2019t know why you had this image\nin your head of an elderly man with white hair but the young dorky\nlooking man with curly hair and hipster chic was not in the slightest\nwhat you imagined.</p><p>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t often go by your real name any more. I find that fun,\nyou\u2019ve forged your own way in life,\u201d he continues talking.</p><p>\n\u201cChuck?!\u201d comes the voice of Sam.</p><p>\n\u201cOh no way,\u201d Dean stammers.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you turn around to them, confused.</p><p>\n\u201cOh, you weren\u2019t here when they met me before, I\u2019m God but you can\ncall me Chuck. Hey we\u2019re kinda the same in that regard with names and\nall,\u201d Chuck extends his hand.</p><p>\nYou\u2019re shaking hands with God. You\u2019re sure your mind couldn\u2019t take\nthat much more amazement.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing their gospel for some time now, The\nWinchesters,\u201d Chuck explains. \u201cThey met me many years ago. Didn\u2019t\nI boys?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah thanks for those lasting words, man,\u201d Dean frowns. \u201cI\u2019ll\nnever be able to get \u2018Wincest\u2019 outta my head. Internet, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s just people having fun,\u201d Chuck smiles. \u201cNow, you prayed\nto me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to hear,\u201d you admit.</p><p>\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s talk somewhere more familiar,\u201d Chuck nods.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\nIt felt very strange being in the bunker with God. \n</p><p>\nCrowley hadn\u2019t said a single word and you wonder if he was\nfrightened. After all, he was a being who\u2019d turned from God\u2019s light\ntechnically.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re not buying this are you, Dean?\u201d Chuck notes Dean\u2019s sour\nface. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThat you\u2026you are God? Nah,\u201d Dean shakes his head. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll believe it better from my former prophet,\u201d Chuck\nwaves his hand.</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a curtain of light that drops from the ceiling and shimmers\nbefore it draws back to reveal\u2026.</p><p>\n\u201cKevin!\u201d you gasp.</p><p>\nKevin Tran. That sweet little boy you looked after, that sweet little\nboy that you burned on a funeral pyre.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha,\u201d he grins.</p><p>\nYou don\u2019t care if he\u2019s only an illusion, you walk forward and attempt\nto hug him. When you make contact with solid flesh, your composure\ndissolves and you draw him into a tight hug.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d you whisper against him. \u201cI should\u2019ve protected\nyou better.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you at all,\u201d Kevin tells you. \u201cYou did\neverything you could. Please don\u2019t torture yourself any more,\nTabitha. You know what my Heaven was?\u201d</p><p>\nYou pull back looking into his placid face, a face you\u2019ve only seen a\ncouple of times on him in real life.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou, me and Dean,\u201d he smiles warmly. \u201cWhen you made me dinner.\nWhen we just talked and laughed like a normal\u2026..family would.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cKid you\u2019re gonna make me cry,\u201d Dean hides his mouth with his\nhand, looking to the ceiling. \n</p><p>\nYou\u2019re already crying. You were done being the stalwart one of the\ngroup. You were just so happy to see him again, to know that he was\nalright and he was in a better place.</p><p>\n\u201cTrust Chuck, Tabitha, Dean, everybody,\u201d Kevin announces. \u201cEven\nyou Crowley. I\u2019ve watched you and Tabitha\u2019s made you bearable now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo hard feelings then?\u201d Crowley asks, his hands dug into the\npockets of his overcoat.</p><p>\n\u201cNah,\u201d Kevin laughs. \u201cYou got your karma in the end. The books\nare balanced.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s very\u2026.magnanimous of you,\u201d Crowley ponders.</p><p>\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good soul,\u201d Chuck smiles. \u201cI think you\u2019ve earned a\nlittle extra something, Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\nHe waves his hand and Kevin is enveloped in pure light before he\nfades out of existence, only swirling specks like tiny fireflies left\nin his wake. You knew what had happened. He\u2019d truly been laid to rest\nnow, a private corner of Heaven reserved for only the most pious.\nYou\u2019d heard that is was possible.</p><p>\nYou just let your hands float through the dancing lights, the last\nmemory you\u2019ll have of Kevin before turning to see Sam looking excited\nbeyond belief, Crowley looking completely stunned and Dean\u2026..Dean\nlooked livid.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re angry at me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Chuck sighs.</p><p>\n\u201cDamn straight I am,\u201d Dean hisses. \u201cWhere the hell were you?! I\ncalled for you so many times. <i>Everyone\u2019s</i> called for you so\nmany damn times. Did you just get busy during the World Wars? The\nPlague?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI tried being hands on, okay?\u201d Chuck holds up his hands. \u201cOld\nTestament remember? Didn\u2019t work out so well. I just left you guys to\nit and you\u2019ve done better than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Dean says in a voice that\u2019s bordering on dangerous.\n\u201cWars? Biochemical weapons? Murders? Rapes? None of that is\n<i>better</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut you have music and art and dance,\u201d Chuck smiles almost\ndeliriously. \u201cAnd that\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s bullcrap!\u201d Dean roars. \u201cYou\u2019re just making excuses for\nabandoning us!\u201d</p><p>\nYou see the subtle change in Chuck, a change that reminds you <i>exactly</i>\nhow much power he held. The smile faded, the posture stiffened and\nthe eyes darkened. You felt afraid in that instant.</p><p>\n\u201cDon\u2019t project your Daddy issues on me, Dean,\u201d Chuck says\nsternly. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI-\u201d Dean begins but you cut him off.</p><p>\n\u201cCan you help us? What I asked of you?\u201d you interrupt.</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t get involved,\u201d Chuck falls back into that sweet and\nkinda goofy stance. \u201cBut I have faith in you guys.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d you blink. \u201cThen why did you answer my prayer at\nall?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI felt like you needed a boost,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cSomething to\nmotivate you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBy just leaving us to it?\u201d you clarify. \u201cYou think you showing\nup and doing absolutely jack shit is going to motivate us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh of course!\u201d Chuck slaps his palm to his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t do\nmuch in your state can you? You\u2019re technically dying.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe\u2019s what?!\u201d Crowley steps forward.</p><p>\n\u201cHumans can\u2019t carry the children of demons, Crowley. You should\nknow that,\u201d Chuck chides. \n</p><p>\n\u201cSome make it,\u201d Crowley tries to argue.</p><p>\n\u201cBut Tabitha is not one of them,\u201d Chuck turns his gaze to you.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not destined to survive this child. You would\u2019ve survived\nif you\u2019d actually carried <i>Lucifer\u2019s</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo chance in Hell I\u2019d ever carry Lucifer\u2019s child,\u201d you say\nangrily. \u201cThis is just to save me from him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMy son is\u2026.erratic,\u201d Chuck pats at his unruly hair. \u201cI\napologise he\u2019s so fixated on you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen do something!\u201d Crowley demands, bristling with rage.\n\u201cBefore he turns her into a broodmare.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTold you, I\u2019m hands off now,\u201d Chuck says nonchalantly. \u201cYou\nguys are smart. It\u2019ll work out.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSome help you are. You\u2019re just useless,\u201d Dean snarls.</p><p>\n\u201cFine, you want me to help?\u201d Chuck gets irate again before slamming\nhis palm on your stomach and there\u2019s a hot sensation before the light\nin his hand burns out. \u201cThere, I helped. Go team Free Will right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d you ask in shock. \u201cWhat did you do to me?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSaved you,\u201d Chuck answers shortly. \u201cNow you have a chance at\nlife so use it well against Amara.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDid you just kill my child?\u201d Crowley gapes in absolute horror.\n\u201cDid you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mercy,\u201d Chuck smiles sweetly. \u201cWould you rather have\nyour child or Tabitha?\u201d</p><p>\nYou felt like there should be some\u2026empty feeling. Some fan fare.\nAnything that would indicate that God had just made your growing\nchild disappear in an instant. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThat was not your choice to make,\u201d you say, absolutely maddened\nbeyond belief. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBut you would\u2019ve died?\u201d Chuck says puzzled. \u201cYou should be\nthanking me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve just given Lucifer licence to try and get me again,\u201d\nyour voice starts shaking, the pitch going in and out as you try and\ncontrol the fire burning in your heart. \u201cYou\u2019ve just given him even\nmore reason to be angry at you because he thought that it was <i>his</i>\nchild.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLike I haven\u2019t ever handled people being disappointed in me,\u201d\nChuck gives you a reproachful look.</p><p>\nYou\u2019re not sure what on earth possessed you to lose your damn mind.\nYou think all the stress had just gotten to you. You just walked up\nand punched Chuck straight in the face.</p><p>\n\u201cYou selfish arsehole!\u201d you yell, putting your full power into\nit.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you\u2026are you kidding me right now?\u201d Chuck blinks, touching\nhis face.</p><p>\n\u201cShe just punched God,\u201d Dean looks starstruck.\u201dBoy what a turn\non.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDean,\u201d Sam says, half scowling, half apprehensive.</p><p>\nCrowley just comes behind you, silently wrapping you up in a hug. His\ngrip is crushing and he buries his face in your hair. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d is all he whispers and it breaks your heart to\nhear the defeat and grief in his voice.</p><p>\nYou knew how much that child meant to him. Perhaps he would\u2019ve told\nyou to abort it had he known it would kill you but to have that\nchoice ripped away from you both\u2026\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cGo to bed, the lot of you,\u201d Chuck just snaps his fingers, a dark look on his face.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\nYou wake up in your own bed, the beat up alarm clock registering that\nis was eight in the morning. \n</p><p>\nYou have no memory of getting there and it was the afternoon when you\nlast remember speaking to anyone. How had so much time passed?</p><p>\nYou feel someone stir next to you and Crowley jerks up, reaching\nblindly for you. You meet him half way and he just bundles you into\nhis chest.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t\nknow it would kill you. Forgive me, kitten.\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s an odd shaking sensation and you realise he\u2019s crying as he\nholds you tightly. You\u2019ve never know him to do that. \n</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\u201d you say gently, reaching up and wiping the tears away from\nhis overgrown beard. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You didn\u2019t know. We couldn\u2019t\npossibly have known.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAll I did was hand you a death sentence when I thought I was\nsaving you. I\u2019m reprehensible,\u201d Crowley continues, his voice thick\nand heavy from the sorrow.</p><p>\n\u201cAt least you tried to save me,\u201d you kiss the underside of his\njaw. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. I know you wanted this.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNothing is worth your life, darling,\u201d Crowley says seriously.\n\u201cIf I am to remain childless for the rest of my cursed life then so\nbe it. You are all I want. The action of it though\u2026.it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh Crowley,\u201d you kiss him gently, trying to soothe him.</p><p>\nNever had the King of Hell opened up this much to you since he\u2019d been\ndosed with human blood. He was completely raw, exposed, all for you.</p><p>\n\u201cPlease\u2026..please darling. Tell me you love me,\u201d he seems\nuncharacteristically subservient.</p><p>\n\u201cI love you,\u201d you say with utter conviction.</p><p>\nYou just remain like that for a while, soft kisses, caresses with no\nsexual intention, just a contentment to be close.</p><p>\nYou end up drifting off again.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n\u201cBear witness my chosen,\u201d Amara smiles at you and Dean. \u201cMy\nbrother has finally come out of hiding I see. Took him long enough.\u201d</p><p>\nYou say nothing. The last thing you needed her knowing was that\nGod\u2026Chuck was here but he wasn\u2019t even willing to lift a finger to\nhelp. \n</p><p>\n\u201cSo I\u2019m just making thing clear,\u201d Amara continues, stepping to\nthe side to reveal Castiel/Lucifer in chains, badly beaten and\nbleeding. \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t have much time left\u2026the archangel <i>or</i>\nthe angel. So if God <i>does</i> contact you. I want to know. Are we\nat an understanding?\u201d</p><p>\nYou and Dean just exchange horrified glances before turning back and\nnodding.</p><p>\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d she smiles broadly. \u00a0\u201cNow, time to wake up my\nchosen. You\u2019ve got some God hunting to do.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Permanent tags:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a></p></p>",

Nobody said anything, nobody made a sound\neven.</p><p>\nThe enormity of what had just happened hit you harshly. Not only\ncould you do nothing about Amara right now, you couldn&rsquo;t even trap\nLucifer. If you couldn&rsquo;t even trap Lucifer, what hope in hell did you\nhave of stopping Amara from ripping the world apart?</p><p>\nNever had you felt true despair. Even in the times you almost died\nyou had hope. Now you had nothing to cling onto, just an impending\nsense of dread. This was it, this was the endgame and you&rsquo;d just\nshown your best hand and lost.</p><p>\nYou felt Crowley&rsquo;s fingers dig a little into your skin, obviously\nlistening in to your desperate thoughts but you didn&rsquo;t care. What did\nit matter any more? \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;We could just drive,&rdquo; Dean says quietly. &ldquo;Anywhere. Let&rsquo;s go\nto the mountains and watch the sunset or something. Last night on\nearth barbecue.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Dean, we&hellip;.&rdquo; Sam trails off but he knows he can&rsquo;t offer\nanything helpful. &ldquo;We need to fight this to the end.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Why, Sammy?&rdquo; Dean turns around, unclipping his seatbelt. &ldquo;We\nlost. We lost big time. The power of God wasn&rsquo;t enough to smite her,\nCas is completely gone to us. We got nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley, tell him,&rdquo; Sam says.</p><p>\nOne look at Crowley&rsquo;s firm set jaw and that told you enough. You&rsquo;d\nnever seen him look so grim.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Sam. I can&rsquo;t. Dean is&hellip;.right,&rdquo; Crowley sighs. &ldquo;We\nare absolutely blind, powerless and the only thing we could possibly\nexploit is Amara&rsquo;s interest in Tabitha and Dean but that still leaves\nLucifer as a problem. We are caught between a rock and a hard place,\nI believe the expression is.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;So none of you have anything? Any ideas?&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s face becomes\ncrestfallen.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Face it, Sammy. We just gotta make the most of the time we have\nleft,&rdquo; Dean sighs, wrenching his necklace over his head and\nthrowing it with disdain into the back seat. &ldquo;Nobody is gonna help\nus now.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou pick the necklace up from the floor, tracing your fingers over\nthe strange design. It&rsquo;s well worn but also well loved.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; you ask quietly, your mind completely distracted.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be linked to God,&rdquo; Dean scoffs bitterly. &ldquo;Show\nme when he&rsquo;s close, you know? God is a douchebag though and he\ndoesn&rsquo;t give a damn about anyone. Coward.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou couldn&rsquo;t believe such a tiny object was supposed to have that\nmuch power. It was so delicate, so unassuming.</p><p>\nYou took what Dean had said and you did something quite ridiculous,\nsomething you&rsquo;d not done since you were a small girl. You prayed to God.</p><p><i>I\nknow you probably aren&rsquo;t listening, you might not even care but The\nDarkness will consume the world and I&rsquo;m afraid. If you&rsquo;re out there,\nplease help us. Please help them.</i></p><p>\nYou didn&rsquo;t expect anything to happen. It was just a silent offering\nto calm your brain. So when the pendant started glowing, you just\nabout almost choked on your own breath.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Guys!&rdquo; you started flapping your arms like a hyperactive child.\n&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou watch as three sets of eyes completely widen on the necklace.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What did you do?!&rdquo; Dean demands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never done that!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I prayed,&rdquo; you admit. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well God must be into some feminist crap because he&rsquo;s never\nanswered when I&rsquo;ve prayed,&rdquo; Dean scowls before taking the necklace\nback and scrambling out of the Impala.</p><p>\nIn fact you all do. You hop next to Dean, staring as he turns this\nway and that with it, the pendant glowing bright and dim with each\nsweep. You take it from him when he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be getting it.</p><p>\nIt&rsquo;s like a compass and the brighter it glows, that&rsquo;s the direction\nyou need to go. You follow the line, wending in and out of the street\nuntil you hit the main street and see a man helping up some\npedestrians who&rsquo;d fallen into the road.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabitha!&rdquo; Crowley calls, trying to keep up as he manages to put\none hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\nDean and Sam follow, just staring into the street, trying to decipher\nwhat it meant.</p><p>\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; you almost whisper. &ldquo;The light is almost\nblinding. That&rsquo;s God.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou walk without thinking, purpose true in your mind as you reach the\nman with his back turned and stop, your heart hammering wildly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hello. Tabitha isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he turns around.</p><p>\nGod is not what you expected. You don&rsquo;t know why you had this image\nin your head of an elderly man with white hair but the young dorky\nlooking man with curly hair and hipster chic was not in the slightest\nwhat you imagined.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t often go by your real name any more. I find that fun,\nyou&rsquo;ve forged your own way in life,&rdquo; he continues talking.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Chuck?!&rdquo; comes the voice of Sam.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh no way,&rdquo; Dean stammers.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you turn around to them, confused.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh, you weren&rsquo;t here when they met me before, I&rsquo;m God but you can\ncall me Chuck. Hey we&rsquo;re kinda the same in that regard with names and\nall,&rdquo; Chuck extends his hand.</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re shaking hands with God. You&rsquo;re sure your mind couldn&rsquo;t take\nthat much more amazement.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing their gospel for some time now, The\nWinchesters,&rdquo; Chuck explains. &ldquo;They met me many years ago. Didn&rsquo;t\nI boys?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah thanks for those lasting words, man,&rdquo; Dean frowns. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nnever be able to get &lsquo;Wincest&rsquo; outta my head. Internet, Jesus.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just people having fun,&rdquo; Chuck smiles. &ldquo;Now, you prayed\nto me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to hear,&rdquo; you admit.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s talk somewhere more familiar,&rdquo; Chuck nods.</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\nIt felt very strange being in the bunker with God. \n</p><p>\nCrowley hadn&rsquo;t said a single word and you wonder if he was\nfrightened. After all, he was a being who&rsquo;d turned from God&rsquo;s light\ntechnically.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not buying this are you, Dean?&rdquo; Chuck notes Dean&rsquo;s sour\nface. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;That you&hellip;you are God? Nah,&rdquo; Dean shakes his head. &ldquo;Not you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll believe it better from my former prophet,&rdquo; Chuck\nwaves his hand.</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a curtain of light that drops from the ceiling and shimmers\nbefore it draws back to reveal&hellip;.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Kevin!&rdquo; you gasp.</p><p>\nKevin Tran. That sweet little boy you looked after, that sweet little\nboy that you burned on a funeral pyre.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabitha,&rdquo; he grins.</p><p>\nYou don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s only an illusion, you walk forward and attempt\nto hug him. When you make contact with solid flesh, your composure\ndissolves and you draw him into a tight hug.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; you whisper against him. &ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve protected\nyou better.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you at all,&rdquo; Kevin tells you. &ldquo;You did\neverything you could. Please don&rsquo;t torture yourself any more,\nTabitha. You know what my Heaven was?&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou pull back looking into his placid face, a face you&rsquo;ve only seen a\ncouple of times on him in real life.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You, me and Dean,&rdquo; he smiles warmly. &ldquo;When you made me dinner.\nWhen we just talked and laughed like a normal&hellip;..family would.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Kid you&rsquo;re gonna make me cry,&rdquo; Dean hides his mouth with his\nhand, looking to the ceiling. \n</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re already crying. You were done being the stalwart one of the\ngroup. You were just so happy to see him again, to know that he was\nalright and he was in a better place.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Trust Chuck, Tabitha, Dean, everybody,&rdquo; Kevin announces. &ldquo;Even\nyou Crowley. I&rsquo;ve watched you and Tabitha&rsquo;s made you bearable now.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;No hard feelings then?&rdquo; Crowley asks, his hands dug into the\npockets of his overcoat.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Kevin laughs. &ldquo;You got your karma in the end. The books\nare balanced.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very&hellip;.magnanimous of you,&rdquo; Crowley ponders.</p><p>\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good soul,&rdquo; Chuck smiles. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve earned a\nlittle extra something, Kevin.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe waves his hand and Kevin is enveloped in pure light before he\nfades out of existence, only swirling specks like tiny fireflies left\nin his wake. You knew what had happened. He&rsquo;d truly been laid to rest\nnow, a private corner of Heaven reserved for only the most pious.\nYou&rsquo;d heard that is was possible.</p><p>\nYou just let your hands float through the dancing lights, the last\nmemory you&rsquo;ll have of Kevin before turning to see Sam looking excited\nbeyond belief, Crowley looking completely stunned and Dean&hellip;..Dean\nlooked livid.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re angry at me, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Chuck sighs.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Damn straight I am,&rdquo; Dean hisses. &ldquo;Where the hell were you?! I\ncalled for you so many times. <i>Everyone&rsquo;s</i> called for you so\nmany damn times. Did you just get busy during the World Wars?

I just left you guys to\nit and you&rsquo;ve done better than I thought.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; Dean says in a voice that&rsquo;s bordering on dangerous.\n&ldquo;Wars? Biochemical weapons? Murders? Rapes? None of that is\n<i>better</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;But you have music and art and dance,&rdquo; Chuck smiles almost\ndeliriously. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bullcrap!&rdquo; Dean roars. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just making excuses for\nabandoning us!&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou see the subtle change in Chuck, a change that reminds you <i>exactly</i>\nhow much power he held. The smile faded, the posture stiffened and\nthe eyes darkened. You felt afraid in that instant.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t project your Daddy issues on me, Dean,&rdquo; Chuck says\nsternly. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I-&rdquo; Dean begins but you cut him off.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Can you help us? What I asked of you?&rdquo; you interrupt.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get involved,&rdquo; Chuck falls back into that sweet and\nkinda goofy stance. &ldquo;But I have faith in you guys.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; you blink. &ldquo;Then why did you answer my prayer at\nall?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I felt like you needed a boost,&rdquo; he shrugs. &ldquo;Something to\nmotivate you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;By just leaving us to it?&rdquo; you clarify. &ldquo;You think you showing\nup and doing absolutely jack shit is going to motivate us?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh of course!&rdquo; Chuck slaps his palm to his head. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do\nmuch in your state can you? You&rsquo;re technically dying.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;She&rsquo;s what?!&rdquo; Crowley steps forward.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Humans can&rsquo;t carry the children of demons, Crowley. You should\nknow that,&rdquo; Chuck chides. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Some make it,&rdquo; Crowley tries to argue.</p><p>\n&ldquo;But Tabitha is not one of them,&rdquo; Chuck turns his gaze to you.\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not destined to survive this child. You would&rsquo;ve survived\nif you&rsquo;d actually carried <i>Lucifer&rsquo;s</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;No chance in Hell I&rsquo;d ever carry Lucifer&rsquo;s child,&rdquo; you say\nangrily. &ldquo;This is just to save me from him.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;My son is&hellip;.erratic,&rdquo; Chuck pats at his unruly hair. &ldquo;I\napologise he&rsquo;s so fixated on you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Then do something!&rdquo; Crowley demands, bristling with rage.\n&ldquo;Before he turns her into a broodmare.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Told you, I&rsquo;m hands off now,&rdquo; Chuck says nonchalantly. &ldquo;You\nguys are smart. It&rsquo;ll work out.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Some help you are. You&rsquo;re just useless,&rdquo; Dean snarls.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Fine, you want me to help?&rdquo; Chuck gets irate again before slamming\nhis palm on your stomach and there&rsquo;s a hot sensation before the light\nin his hand burns out. &ldquo;There, I helped. Go team Free Will right?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; you ask in shock. &ldquo;What did you do to me?!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Saved you,&rdquo; Chuck answers shortly. &ldquo;Now you have a chance at\nlife so use it well against Amara.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Did you just kill my child?&rdquo; Crowley gapes in absolute horror.\n&ldquo;Did you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mercy,&rdquo; Chuck smiles sweetly. &ldquo;Would you rather have\nyour child or Tabitha?&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou felt like there should be some&hellip;empty feeling. Some fan fare.\nAnything that would indicate that God had just made your growing\nchild disappear in an instant. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;That was not your choice to make,&rdquo; you say, absolutely maddened\nbeyond belief. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;But you would&rsquo;ve died?&rdquo; Chuck says puzzled. &ldquo;You should be\nthanking me.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve just given Lucifer licence to try and get me again,&rdquo;\nyour voice starts shaking, the pitch going in and out as you try and\ncontrol the fire burning in your heart. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just given him even\nmore reason to be angry at you because he thought that it was <i>his</i>\nchild.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Like I haven&rsquo;t ever handled people being disappointed in me,&rdquo;\nChuck gives you a reproachful look.</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re not sure what on earth possessed you to lose your damn mind.\nYou think all the stress had just gotten to you. You just walked up\nand punched Chuck straight in the face.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You selfish arsehole!&rdquo; you yell, putting your full power into\nit.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Are you&hellip;are you kidding me right now?&rdquo; Chuck blinks, touching\nhis face.</p><p>\n&ldquo;She just punched God,&rdquo; Dean looks starstruck.&rdquo;Boy what a turn\non.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Dean,&rdquo; Sam says, half scowling, half apprehensive.</p><p>\nCrowley just comes behind you, silently wrapping you up in a hug. His\ngrip is crushing and he buries his face in your hair. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; is all he whispers and it breaks your heart to\nhear the defeat and grief in his voice.</p><p>\nYou knew how much that child meant to him. Perhaps he would&rsquo;ve told\nyou to abort it had he known it would kill you but to have that\nchoice ripped away from you both&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Go to bed, the lot of you,&rdquo; Chuck just snaps his fingers, a dark look on his face.</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\nYou wake up in your own bed, the beat up alarm clock registering that\nis was eight in the morning. \n</p><p>\nYou have no memory of getting there and it was the afternoon when you\nlast remember speaking to anyone. How had so much time passed?</p><p>\nYou feel someone stir next to you and Crowley jerks up, reaching\nblindly for you. You meet him half way and he just bundles you into\nhis chest.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he repeats. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t\nknow it would kill you. Forgive me, kitten.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s an odd shaking sensation and you realise he&rsquo;s crying as he\nholds you tightly. You&rsquo;ve never know him to do that. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you say gently, reaching up and wiping the tears away from\nhis overgrown beard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. You didn&rsquo;t know. We couldn&rsquo;t\npossibly have known.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;All I did was hand you a death sentence when I thought I was\nsaving you. I&rsquo;m reprehensible,&rdquo; Crowley continues, his voice thick\nand heavy from the sorrow.</p><p>\n&ldquo;At least you tried to save me,&rdquo; you kiss the underside of his\njaw. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry. I know you wanted this.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Nothing is worth your life, darling,&rdquo; Crowley says seriously.\n&ldquo;If I am to remain childless for the rest of my cursed life then so\nbe it. You are all I want. The action of it though&hellip;.it hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh Crowley,&rdquo; you kiss him gently, trying to soothe him.</p><p>\nNever had the King of Hell opened up this much to you since he&rsquo;d been\ndosed with human blood. He was completely raw, exposed, all for you.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Please&hellip;..please darling. Tell me you love me,&rdquo; he seems\nuncharacteristically subservient.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you say with utter conviction.</p><p>\nYou just remain like that for a while, soft kisses, caresses with no\nsexual intention, just a contentment to be close.</p><p>\nYou end up drifting off again.</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Bear witness my chosen,&rdquo; Amara smiles at you and Dean. &ldquo;My\nbrother has finally come out of hiding I see. Took him long enough.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou say nothing. The last thing you needed her knowing was that\nGod&hellip;Chuck was here but he wasn&rsquo;t even willing to lift a finger to\nhelp. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m just making thing clear,&rdquo; Amara continues, stepping to\nthe side to reveal Castiel/Lucifer in chains, badly beaten and\nbleeding. &ldquo;This one doesn&rsquo;t have much time left&hellip;the archangel <i>or</i>\nthe angel. So if God <i>does</i> contact you. I want to know. Are we\nat an understanding?&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou and Dean just exchange horrified glances before turning back and\nnodding.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; she smiles broadly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now, time to wake up my\nchosen. You&rsquo;ve got some God hunting to do.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Permanent tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a></p></p>",

Instead of a blooming friendship, their partnership begins entirely on the wrong foot, causing tension and hatred towards each other. Lifetime after lifetime brings them bickering worse than any old married couple, arguing over the most obscene things, betting on who their charge will pick this time, and of course, obnoxious flirtations that make all of their charges either uncomfortable or roll their eyes.<br/>Despite not being allowed to pick favorites, their latest charge Charlie, wiggles her way into their hearts, right before making the worst decision of her life.<br/>Dean and Castiel will have to put their differences aside in order to save her, going above and beyond the call of duty. Will they be able to work together for the greater good, finding things out about themselves and each other along the way?

Or will this mission end with cliche tragedy?</p><p>Words: 20742, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Supernatural/works\">Supernatural</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Explicit/works\">Explicit</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/No%20Archive%20Warnings%20Apply/works\">No Archive Warnings Apply</a></li><li>Categories: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/M*s*M/works\">M/M</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Dean%20Winchester/works\">Dean Winchester</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Castiel%20(Supernatural)/works\">Castiel (Supernatural)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Garth%20Fitzgerald%20IV/works\">Garth Fitzgerald IV</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Crowley%20(Supernatural)/works\">Crowley (Supernatural)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Naomi%20(Supernatural)/works\">Naomi (Supernatural)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Sam%20Winchester/works\">Sam Winchester</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Jo%20Harvelle/works\">Jo Harvelle</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Gabriel%20(Supernatural)/works\">Gabriel (Supernatural)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Meg%20Masters/works\">Meg Masters</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Balthazar%20(Supernatural)/works\">Balthazar (Supernatural)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Charlie%20Bradbury/works\">Charlie Bradbury</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Dorothy%20Baum/works\">Dorothy Baum</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Kevin%20Tran/works\">Kevin Tran</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Rowena%20MacLeod/works\">Rowena MacLeod</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Abaddon%20(Supernatural)/works\">Abaddon (Supernatural)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Jack%20Kline/works\">Jack Kline</a></li><li>Relationships: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Castiel*s*Dean%20Winchester/works\">Castiel/Dean Winchester</a></li><li>Additional Tags: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Alternate%20Universe/works\">Alternate Universe</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/the%20Angel%20and%20Demon%20on%20your%20shoulder/works\">the Angel and Demon on your shoulder</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Angel%20Castiel%20(Supernatural)/works\">Angel Castiel (Supernatural)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Demon%20Dean%20Winchester/works\">Demon Dean Winchester</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Demon%20Sam%20Winchester/works\">Demon Sam Winchester</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Enemies%20to%20Lovers/works\">Enemies to Lovers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Romantic%20Comedy/works\">Romantic Comedy</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Minor%20Garth*s*Bess/works\">Minor Garth/Bess</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Minor%20Dorothy%20Baum*s*Charlie%20Bradbury/works\">Minor Dorothy Baum/Charlie Bradbury</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Minor%20Jack*s*Clark/works\">Minor Jack/Clark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Angst/works\">Angst</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Angst%20with%20a%20Happy%20Ending/works\">Angst with a Happy Ending</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Humor/works\">Humor</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Drinking/works\">Drinking</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Implied*s*Referenced%20Drug%20Use/works\">Implied/Referenced Drug Use</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Wing%20Kink/works\">Wing Kink</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Bottom%20Castiel/works\">Bottom Castiel</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Top%20Dean%20Winchester/works\">Top Dean Winchester</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Grace%20Kink/works\">Grace Kink</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Grace%20Sex/works\">Grace Sex</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Implied%20Switching/works\">Implied Switching</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Demon%20Deals/works\">Demon Deals</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Soulless%20Charlie/works\">Soulless Charlie</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Serious%20Injuries/works\">Serious Injuries</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hurt*s*Comfort/works\">Hurt/Comfort</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/True%20Love's%20Kiss/works\">True Love&rsquo;s Kiss</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/sorta%20-%20Freeform/works\">sorta -
