That, and the blinds Dan had forgotten to close when he stumbled into bed an hour after Phil. He lays there and nuzzles closer to Dan\u2019s turned back. He knows he has to wee, can feel it in the pressure building in his lower abdomen with every passing second.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t get up, though. Instead, he presses kisses along the creamy skin of Dan\u2019s shoulder that\u2019s still peeking out of the duvet. Phil pecks his way up toward Dan\u2019s neck and starts nipping on the skin there that\u2019s still warm from Dan\u2019s sleeping body.</p><!-- more --><p>Phil rolls his hips forward, pressing into Dan\u2019s backside, and a <i>zing!</i> of pleasure shoots up his spine at the pressure it puts on his hardening dick and full bladder. He groans a little and does it again, wrapping his arms tight around Dan to gain a little leverage.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanna fuck, you can just wake me up like a normal person. You don\u2019t have to hump me while I sleep.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is still thick with sleep and he doesn\u2019t move more than to pull Phil\u2019s arm around him tighter, eliminating the remaining space between them.</p><p>\u201cMmm, sorry. Just feels good.\u201d Dan hums and pushes back a little, eliciting a low whine from Phil at the feeling.</p><p>\u201cHave you wee\u2019d yet?\u201d Dan asks, even though they both know he already knows the answer, given how breathy Phil gets when he presses against Dan.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil says quietly into the crease of Dan\u2019s neck.</p><p>Dan lets out a breathy, soft chuckle and turns to face Phil.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna play?\u201d It\u2019s whispered between the press of their lips, and Phil doesn\u2019t move more than to nod eagerly.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t say anything else, just moves to grab the lube from his nightstand and nudges Phil out of the way so he can lay in the middle of the bed.</p><p>\u201cCome \u2018ere.\u201d</p><p>Phil complies easily, already eager to have Dan\u2019s hands on him; they make him feel astoundingly good every time.</p><p>Phil settles himself on top of Dan\u2019s thighs, loving the way he can feel Dan\u2019s erection growing steadily under him. Dan pulls at the waistband of Phil\u2019s pajama pants, encouraging him to peel them down to his thighs; his stiff cock springs out of the confines of the Ninja Turtle pajamas that seem entirely too inappropriate right now.</p><p>Dan gets a hand around him and Phil lets out a whimper that is meant to be quiet, but doesn\u2019t stay that way. Dan just smirks at him, always a little excited to see how whiny and pliant Phil can get when he\u2019s chasing his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWant me to fuck you?\u201d Dan\u2019s already got the lube cab popped open and is spreading it over his fingers to warm up the slick substance.</p><p>Phil nods and sighs in relief as Dan nudges him forward and swipes his sticky finger over the edge of his rim. It sends another shiver up Phil\u2019s spine and he pushes back on the finger, ready to have it in him already.</p><p>\u201cSo impatient,\u201d Dan chuckles, pulling Phil\u2019s earlobe into his mouth and giving it a gentle tug.</p><p>\u201c<i>Please!</i>\u201d Phil whines, not in the mood to extend the foreplay today.</p><p>Dan concedes, pushing the first finger into the tight muscle of Phil\u2019s most intimate area. He pauses there, letting Phil get used to it, and they both groan at the feeling. Phil wiggles his hips a little to spur Dan back into action and he complies easily.</p><p>Thankfully, Dan doesn\u2019t draw out the prepping like he normally might. Phil loved it when they did that, made things slow and building and delicious, but today slow and soft just won\u2019t cut it. He needs Dan in him right now to help sooth the itch he can\u2019t scratch by himself. Playing is good, but only when he can do it with Dan.</p><p>Once Dan has deemed him stretched enough, he pulls Phil up toward his face to line himself up, pressing a light kiss to Phil\u2019s lips and giving him a small smile. It\u2019s enough to make Phil\u2019s heart pound a little harder with contentment, but he doesn\u2019t get long to appreciate the sweet moment before Dan is slowly entering him, erasing everything in Phil\u2019s mind other than \u2018<i>fuck</i>,\u2019 \u2018<i>yes</i>,\u2019 and \u2018<i>more.</i>\u2019</p><p>He can feel the pressure in his bladder start to grow the deeper Dan presses in. It\u2019s enough to make Phil dizzy, feeling the tiny sparks of pleasure from the tips of his ears all the way down to his toes. It takes him a solid minute and a half to get used to Dan being inside - ten years later and it still shocks him at how tight they fit together - but once he\u2019s ready, he doesn\u2019t hold back. He lifts himself up off of Dan and slams back down, reveling in the choked noise Dan makes and the way the ache in his bladder makes goosebumps break out across his skin.</p><p>\u201cFuck, <i>Phil</i>,\u201d Dan keens. His face is flushed and sweaty, his curls starting to mat against his head, but Phil still can\u2019t help but think he looks incredible. Maybe it\u2019s a little bit of narcissism, knowing that he looks this wrecked because of what Phil\u2019s doing, but it\u2019s mostly just how insanely attracted he is to Dan, regardless of what they\u2019re doing.</p><p>It\u2019s not long before the ache in his bladder starts to become too much, bordering on painful. He slows his movements and drops down to press his chest against Dan\u2019s. Dan understands right away, holding onto Phil\u2019s hips so tight, there will certainly be little fingertip bruises later, and starts grinding up in slow circles. It\u2019s enough of a slowdown that Phil can start to focus on making himself soft enough to go.</p><p>It\u2019s not easy, he\u2019s so turned on and desperate to come, but he knows this will only work if he\u2019s calmed down a little. He takes a few deep breaths and focuses the best he can on making his dick just a bit flaccid.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it. C\u2019mon, baby. Give it to me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s hips stutter; the words Dan is whispering in his ear only serve to turn him on more, but he concentrates and presses down on the flushed and angry head of his cock and starts to feel himself leak. It\u2019s slow going at first, the stream barely coming out, but once Phil bares down a little and pushes, the flow comes easily.</p><p>The feeling is incredible, enough to pull a near scream out of Phil and a resulting moan from Dan. The more he goes, the better it feels, especially once Dan starts thrusting hard and fast into his prostate.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck.\u201d He knows that if Dan weren\u2019t so out of it, he would probably tease Phil about swearing so much, but he remains silent, too preoccupied with driving his hips upward into Phil\u2019s tight heat.</p><p>It\u2019s too much and not enough all at once. He can feel his stream start to slow and the heat building in his gut coming to a peak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close. Please!\u201d Phil cries, grinding down harder onto Dan\u2019s cock, feeling relief when Dan thrusts up and gets his hand around Phil\u2019s cock where it\u2019s leaking between them.</p><p>When the last few drops are done leaking out of him, it only takes two quick tugs from Dan\u2019s hand and he\u2019s coming, adding to the mess already covering them.</p><p>Phil feels boneless when he\u2019s finished, radiating satisfaction to his very core. Dan isn\u2019t finished, though Phil can tell he\u2019s close by the whines he\u2019s letting out and the stuttering of his hips. Phil sits back up, admiring the mess he\u2019s made of the bed and of both of them, and clenches tightly around Dan, bouncing himself up and down quickly in the way he knows makes Dan\u2019s toes curl.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes. Fuck, Phi-\u201d His orgasm is punched out of him, and Phil can feel the way Dan twitches inside of him, painting his walls with Dan\u2019s seed.</p><p>Phil slumps forward again, the cold piss and come between them making a squelching noise that has them both bursting out with laughter.</p><p>\u201cWe need showers,\u201d Dan mumbles, kissing the part of Phil\u2019s forehead that isn\u2019t pressed into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Yeah, we\u2019re gross. You\u2019re a bad influence.\u201d</p><p>He can hear Dan\u2019s stuttering protests, but chooses to just press a kiss to his still-flushed cheek and crawl off of Dan and the bed.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, loser. You smell.\u201d</p>",

You don\u2019t have to hump me while I sleep.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is still thick with sleep and he doesn\u2019t move more than to pull Phil\u2019s arm around him tighter, eliminating the remaining space between them.</p><p>\u201cMmm, sorry. Just feels good.\u201d Dan hums and pushes back a little, eliciting a low whine from Phil at the feeling.</p><p>\u201cHave you wee\u2019d yet?\u201d Dan asks, even though they both know he already knows the answer, given how breathy Phil gets when he presses against Dan.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil says quietly into the crease of Dan\u2019s neck.</p><p>Dan lets out a breathy, soft chuckle and turns to face Phil.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna play?\u201d It\u2019s whispered between the press of their lips, and Phil doesn\u2019t move more than to nod eagerly.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t say anything else, just moves to grab the lube from his nightstand and nudges Phil out of the way so he can lay in the middle of the bed.</p><p>\u201cCome \u2018ere.\u201d</p><p>Phil complies easily, already eager to have Dan\u2019s hands on him; they make him feel astoundingly good every time.</p><p>Phil settles himself on top of Dan\u2019s thighs, loving the way he can feel Dan\u2019s erection growing steadily under him. Dan pulls at the waistband of Phil\u2019s pajama pants, encouraging him to peel them down to his thighs; his stiff cock springs out of the confines of the Ninja Turtle pajamas that seem entirely too inappropriate right now.</p><p>Dan gets a hand around him and Phil lets out a whimper that is meant to be quiet, but doesn\u2019t stay that way. Dan just smirks at him, always a little excited to see how whiny and pliant Phil can get when he\u2019s chasing his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWant me to fuck you?\u201d Dan\u2019s already got the lube cab popped open and is spreading it over his fingers to warm up the slick substance.</p><p>Phil nods and sighs in relief as Dan nudges him forward and swipes his sticky finger over the edge of his rim. It sends another shiver up Phil\u2019s spine and he pushes back on the finger, ready to have it in him already.</p><p>\u201cSo impatient,\u201d Dan chuckles, pulling Phil\u2019s earlobe into his mouth and giving it a gentle tug.</p><p>\u201c<i>Please!</i>\u201d Phil whines, not in the mood to extend the foreplay today.</p><p>Dan concedes, pushing the first finger into the tight muscle of Phil\u2019s most intimate area. He pauses there, letting Phil get used to it, and they both groan at the feeling. Phil wiggles his hips a little to spur Dan back into action and he complies easily.</p><p>Thankfully, Dan doesn\u2019t draw out the prepping like he normally might. Phil loved it when they did that, made things slow and building and delicious, but today slow and soft just won\u2019t cut it. He needs Dan in him right now to help sooth the itch he can\u2019t scratch by himself. Playing is good, but only when he can do it with Dan.</p><p>Once Dan has deemed him stretched enough, he pulls Phil up toward his face to line himself up, pressing a light kiss to Phil\u2019s lips and giving him a small smile. It\u2019s enough to make Phil\u2019s heart pound a little harder with contentment, but he doesn\u2019t get long to appreciate the sweet moment before Dan is slowly entering him, erasing everything in Phil\u2019s mind other than \u2018<i>fuck</i>,\u2019 \u2018<i>yes</i>,\u2019 and \u2018<i>more.</i>\u2019</p><p>He can feel the pressure in his bladder start to grow the deeper Dan presses in. It\u2019s enough to make Phil dizzy, feeling the tiny sparks of pleasure from the tips of his ears all the way down to his toes. It takes him a solid minute and a half to get used to Dan being inside - ten years later and it still shocks him at how tight they fit together - but once he\u2019s ready, he doesn\u2019t hold back. He lifts himself up off of Dan and slams back down, reveling in the choked noise Dan makes and the way the ache in his bladder makes goosebumps break out across his skin.</p><p>\u201cFuck, <i>Phil</i>,\u201d Dan keens. His face is flushed and sweaty, his curls starting to mat against his head, but Phil still can\u2019t help but think he looks incredible. Maybe it\u2019s a little bit of narcissism, knowing that he looks this wrecked because of what Phil\u2019s doing, but it\u2019s mostly just how insanely attracted he is to Dan, regardless of what they\u2019re doing.</p><p>It\u2019s not long before the ache in his bladder starts to become too much, bordering on painful. He slows his movements and drops down to press his chest against Dan\u2019s. Dan understands right away, holding onto Phil\u2019s hips so tight, there will certainly be little fingertip bruises later, and starts grinding up in slow circles. It\u2019s enough of a slowdown that Phil can start to focus on making himself soft enough to go.</p><p>It\u2019s not easy, he\u2019s so turned on and desperate to come, but he knows this will only work if he\u2019s calmed down a little. He takes a few deep breaths and focuses the best he can on making his dick just a bit flaccid.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it. C\u2019mon, baby. Give it to me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s hips stutter; the words Dan is whispering in his ear only serve to turn him on more, but he concentrates and presses down on the flushed and angry head of his cock and starts to feel himself leak. It\u2019s slow going at first, the stream barely coming out, but once Phil bares down a little and pushes, the flow comes easily.</p><p>The feeling is incredible, enough to pull a near scream out of Phil and a resulting moan from Dan. The more he goes, the better it feels, especially once Dan starts thrusting hard and fast into his prostate.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck.\u201d He knows that if Dan weren\u2019t so out of it, he would probably tease Phil about swearing so much, but he remains silent, too preoccupied with driving his hips upward into Phil\u2019s tight heat.</p><p>It\u2019s too much and not enough all at once. He can feel his stream start to slow and the heat building in his gut coming to a peak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close. Please!\u201d Phil cries, grinding down harder onto Dan\u2019s cock, feeling relief when Dan thrusts up and gets his hand around Phil\u2019s cock where it\u2019s leaking between them.</p><p>When the last few drops are done leaking out of him, it only takes two quick tugs from Dan\u2019s hand and he\u2019s coming, adding to the mess already covering them.</p><p>Phil feels boneless when he\u2019s finished, radiating satisfaction to his very core. Dan isn\u2019t finished, though Phil can tell he\u2019s close by the whines he\u2019s letting out and the stuttering of his hips. Phil sits back up, admiring the mess he\u2019s made of the bed and of both of them, and clenches tightly around Dan, bouncing himself up and down quickly in the way he knows makes Dan\u2019s toes curl.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes. Fuck, Phi-\u201d His orgasm is punched out of him, and Phil can feel the way Dan twitches inside of him, painting his walls with Dan\u2019s seed.</p><p>Phil slumps forward again, the cold piss and come between them making a squelching noise that has them both bursting out with laughter.</p><p>\u201cWe need showers,\u201d Dan mumbles, kissing the part of Phil\u2019s forehead that isn\u2019t pressed into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Yeah, we\u2019re gross. You\u2019re a bad influence.\u201d</p><p>He can hear Dan\u2019s stuttering protests, but chooses to just press a kiss to his still-flushed cheek and crawl off of Dan and the bed.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, loser. You smell.\u201d</p>",

It sends another shiver up Phil&rsquo;s spine and he pushes back on the finger, ready to have it in him already.</p><p>&ldquo;So impatient,&rdquo; Dan chuckles, pulling Phil&rsquo;s earlobe into his mouth and giving it a gentle tug.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Please!</i>&rdquo; Phil whines, not in the mood to extend the foreplay today.</p><p>Dan concedes, pushing the first finger into the tight muscle of Phil&rsquo;s most intimate area. He pauses there, letting Phil get used to it, and they both groan at the feeling. Phil wiggles his hips a little to spur Dan back into action and he complies easily.</p><p>Thankfully, Dan doesn&rsquo;t draw out the prepping like he normally might. Phil loved it when they did that, made things slow and building and delicious, but today slow and soft just won&rsquo;t cut it. He needs Dan in him right now to help sooth the itch he can&rsquo;t scratch by himself. Playing is good, but only when he can do it with Dan.</p><p>Once Dan has deemed him stretched enough, he pulls Phil up toward his face to line himself up, pressing a light kiss to Phil&rsquo;s lips and giving him a small smile. It&rsquo;s enough to make Phil&rsquo;s heart pound a little harder with contentment, but he doesn&rsquo;t get long to appreciate the sweet moment before Dan is slowly entering him, erasing everything in Phil&rsquo;s mind other than &lsquo;<i>fuck</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>yes</i>,&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>more.</i>&rsquo;</p><p>He can feel the pressure in his bladder start to grow the deeper Dan presses in. It&rsquo;s enough to make Phil dizzy, feeling the tiny sparks of pleasure from the tips of his ears all the way down to his toes. It takes him a solid minute and a half to get used to Dan being inside - ten years later and it still shocks him at how tight they fit together - but once he&rsquo;s ready, he doesn&rsquo;t hold back. He lifts himself up off of Dan and slams back down, reveling in the choked noise Dan makes and the way the ache in his bladder makes goosebumps break out across his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, <i>Phil</i>,&rdquo; Dan keens. His face is flushed and sweaty, his curls starting to mat against his head, but Phil still can&rsquo;t help but think he looks incredible. Maybe it&rsquo;s a little bit of narcissism, knowing that he looks this wrecked because of what Phil&rsquo;s doing, but it&rsquo;s mostly just how insanely attracted he is to Dan, regardless of what they&rsquo;re doing.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not long before the ache in his bladder starts to become too much, bordering on painful. He slows his movements and drops down to press his chest against Dan&rsquo;s. Dan understands right away, holding onto Phil&rsquo;s hips so tight, there will certainly be little fingertip bruises later, and starts grinding up in slow circles. It&rsquo;s enough of a slowdown that Phil can start to focus on making himself soft enough to go.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not easy, he&rsquo;s so turned on and desperate to come, but he knows this will only work if he&rsquo;s calmed down a little. He takes a few deep breaths and focuses the best he can on making his dick just a bit flaccid.</p><p>&ldquo;You can do it. C&rsquo;mon, baby. Give it to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hips stutter; the words Dan is whispering in his ear only serve to turn him on more, but he concentrates and presses down on the flushed and angry head of his cock and starts to feel himself leak. It&rsquo;s slow going at first, the stream barely coming out, but once Phil bares down a little and pushes, the flow comes easily.</p><p>The feeling is incredible, enough to pull a near scream out of Phil and a resulting moan from Dan. The more he goes, the better it feels, especially once Dan starts thrusting hard and fast into his prostate.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck.&rdquo; He knows that if Dan weren&rsquo;t so out of it, he would probably tease Phil about swearing so much, but he remains silent, too preoccupied with driving his hips upward into Phil&rsquo;s tight heat.</p><p>It&rsquo;s too much and not enough all at once. He can feel his stream start to slow and the heat building in his gut coming to a peak.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m close. Please!&rdquo; Phil cries, grinding down harder onto Dan&rsquo;s cock, feeling relief when Dan thrusts up and gets his hand around Phil&rsquo;s cock where it&rsquo;s leaking between them.</p><p>When the last few drops are done leaking out of him, it only takes two quick tugs from Dan&rsquo;s hand and he&rsquo;s coming, adding to the mess already covering them.</p><p>Phil feels boneless when he&rsquo;s finished, radiating satisfaction to his very core. Dan isn&rsquo;t finished, though Phil can tell he&rsquo;s close by the whines he&rsquo;s letting out and the stuttering of his hips. Phil sits back up, admiring the mess he&rsquo;s made of the bed and of both of them, and clenches tightly around Dan, bouncing himself up and down quickly in the way he knows makes Dan&rsquo;s toes curl.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, yes. Fuck, Phi-&rdquo; His orgasm is punched out of him, and Phil can feel the way Dan twitches inside of him, painting his walls with Dan&rsquo;s seed.</p><p>Phil slumps forward again, the cold piss and come between them making a squelching noise that has them both bursting out with laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;We need showers,&rdquo; Dan mumbles, kissing the part of Phil&rsquo;s forehead that isn&rsquo;t pressed into his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm. Yeah, we&rsquo;re gross. You&rsquo;re a bad influence.&rdquo;</p><p>He can hear Dan&rsquo;s stuttering protests, but chooses to just press a kiss to his still-flushed cheek and crawl off of Dan and the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, loser. You smell.&rdquo;</p>",

When the poster requested the moderators of the site take action and clarify that this type of attacking other posters just for having different opinions be addressed, this the moderators of the site responded to the person being attacked with: </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83aef061b56e8fce2f3bafed4802f356/tumblr_pn8rcpxQke1vvigvf_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This response just demonstrates that minority opinions aren&rsquo;t welcome and are seen as incorrect and unacceptable. The moderator says all this while in the very next paragraph, admitting that the poster &ldquo;brushed up against the rules.&rdquo; When the person who requested the review called them out on their selective moderating, this was the response they received:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/74ad11a280ad5e42b09aafacf149e199/tumblr_pn8rcpuRB91vvigvf_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>NO, MOD, BEHAVIOR LIKE YOURS GIVES OTHER PEOPLE A BAD IMPRESSION OF THE FORUM AND MAKES PEOPLE FEEL LESS WELCOME. </p><p>I feel the need to write about this because I am an adult and so are the majority of the posters on that website, but a lot of fans of Dan and Phil are teenagers and those adults are behaving extremely poorly and trying to pass their behavior on as if it is acceptable and it is not. They have stalked Dan and Phil, attacked their character, pushed into their private lives for their own entertainment, all while claiming to be their biggest fans and that is all abusive behavior. This is what Dan was upset about in 2012. These are the things that are not respectful and are worth speaking out against and the fact that when people do speak up, they are told they should leave and that they are the problem just goes to show how toxic that forum is and that the moderators cannot be relied on to do their job. This doesn&rsquo;t just apply to IDB. In life, it is never good to be part of a community or to be encouraging of one that does not allow dissent. That is a cult mentality and it is dangerous. </p></p>",
