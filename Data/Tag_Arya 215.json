Like Little Thumbling, she\u2019s stuck\nwith a pack of \u201ctravel companions\u201d (the six siblings in the tale; Lommy, Hot\nPie and Weasel in asoiaf) who aren\u2019t very useful and wouldn\u2019t make it far\nwithout her (even Gendry tells her as much in ACOK), despite her being the\nsmallest and scrawniest of the bunch (except Weasel). </p><p><i>\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s no use,\u201d Gendry repeated stubbornly. \u201cHer and Hot Pie and Lommy, they\u2019re\nslowing us down, and they\u2019re going to get us killed.

Catelyn, Robb and his men are\noffered guests\u2019 rights at the Twins. The ogre\u2019s wife knows that her husband\neats children, but can\u2019t do anything about it.

In Braavos, Arya steals boots (presumably her size \u2013 we\u2019re told\nthat the boots she previously wore were too big for her) from a Night\u2019s Watch\ndeserter, and cuts a purse in ADWD. </p><p><i>Someone\nslit his throat and pushed him into a canal, but they kept his boots.&ldquo;</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>&quot;Good boots are hard to find.&rdquo;</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo; She tried to keep her\nface still.</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Who could have done this thing, I\nwonder?&rdquo;</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Arya of House Stark.&rdquo; She watched\nhis eyes, his mouth, the muscles of his jaw. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC<br/></p><p><i>\n\nShe slipped her hand through the gap, slit the purse open with the finger knife, filled her fist with gold \u2026</i> - The ugly little girl, ADWD<br/></p><p>As we can see, there\u2019s a lot of\nparallels and foils here. I tend to view the <i>boots </i>as a coming-of-age achievement and a symbol of empowerment,\nbut in my opinion, Arya\u2019s story goes beyond that: she wants to go home and the\n\u201cogre\u201d is the main obstacle to that quest. Her story arc in Westeros more or\nless culminate with the events at the Twins (her encounter with the ogre),\nwhere she powerlessly witnesses the slaughter of her family. The rest is details: she takes her revenge on Polliver and get her\nNeedle back, which symbolically marks the end of her peregrinations as a\nprisoner. She frees herself from the Hound (another \u201cogre\u201d figure, though this\none is more ambivalent). Then she leaves. She embarks on another storyline with\nanother \u201cogre\u201d, the Titan of Braavos, who \u201ceat the flesh of little highborn\ngirls\u201d. Braavos, essentially \u2013 what lays behind the Titan \u2013 is another ogre\u2019s\nhouse: </p><p><i>Even\nso, she kept one hand on Needle as they slipped between his legs. More arrow\nslits dotted the insides of those great stone thighs, and when Arya craned her\nneck around to watch the crow&rsquo;s nest slip through with a good ten yards to\nspare, she spied murder holes beneath the Titan&rsquo;s armored skirts, and pale\nfaces staring down at them from behind the iron bars.</i></p><p><i>And\nthen they were past.</i>\n\u2013 Arya, AFFC</p><p>The House of Black and White also\ntries to \u201ceat\u201d Arya\u2019s family: Arya must forget about her mother. She must\nforget about her brothers. She must forget about herself and become No One. She\nmust rid herself of her belonging. This time, nonetheless, she outwits the ogre\nby hiding her most precious possession (Needle) from him. The House of Black\nand White shares another similarity with the ogre\u2019s house, for few who enters\never get out \u2013 actually, one could even make a case of the House of Black and\nWhite \u201cdigesting\u201d those who came to die there: the servants clean the dead,\ntake their purses, coins, clothes, and the faces are taken down a labyrinthine\nweb of stairs, halls, doors underground (the \u201cintestines\u201d) before ending up in\nthe Hall of Faces (as \u201cnourishment\u201d for the House of Black and White). There\u2019s\neven a short scene in AFFC where Arya fears that the meat she\u2019s given for her\nsupper is actually the flesh of the dead (before the kindly man reassures her\nthat it\u2019s only pork). </p><p>Arya\u2019s Little Thumbling can be\ntaken as a criticism of the patriarchy displayed in the original tale: the\nwoodcutter\u2019s wife and the ogre\u2019s wife are both depicted as passive victims of\ntheir husbands\u2019 cruelty (the woodcutter\u2019s wife tries to dissuade her husband\nfrom abandoning their children in the forest, but to no avail). The good\nmother/cruel father dichotomy is quite present in Arya\u2019s storyline, especially\nin Westeros (the good mother Catelyn and the Hound, the meek lady Frey and the\nbig bad Walder). Thus, it\u2019s interesting that the Little Thumbling of Westeros\nis in fact a little girl disguised as a boy. It\u2019s also curious that Arya\nherself takes the role of a mother to \u201cWeasel\u201d. And, as far as parents go, the Little\nThumbling is also a story about the validation of the hero/heroine to his/her\nfamily: the sickly, skinny, useless Little Thumbling save his siblings from an\nogre and presents a bag of gold to his parents at the end of the story. Arya\n\u201cHorseface\u201d Stark, the little sister who can\u2019t sew, can\u2019t stitch, can\u2019t draw or\nsing, would\u2019ve attempted (truly) to save her mother and brother by herself at\nthe Twins \u2013 something the Hound scoffs at, because unfortunately, Arya\u2019s story\nisn\u2019t a fairy tale\u2026</p><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;We should go back,&rdquo; she suddenly decided. &ldquo;We should go back to the Twins and get my mother. She can&rsquo;t be dead. We have to help her.&quot;\u00a0</i></p><p><i>&quot;I thought your sister was the one with a head full of songs,&rdquo; the Hound growled. &ldquo;Frey might have kept your mother alive to ransom, that&rsquo;s true. But there&rsquo;s no way in seven hells I&rsquo;m going to pluck her out of his castle all by my bloody self.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>\u00a0&quot;Not by yourself. I&rsquo;d come too.&ldquo;\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He made a sound that was almost a laugh. &quot;That will scare the piss out of the old man.&rdquo; - </i>Arya, ASOS<br/></p><p>The Little Thumbling is <i>also</i> one of these stories where the hero\u2019s\n\u201cquest\u201d centers around returning home. Another story of the same style would be\n<i>Thumbelina</i>: a tiny girl, the size of\na thumb, is born inside a flower, stolen by a toad who wants to marry her to\nher son, and left on a waterlily so she can\u2019t escape. She receives help from\nsome fishes and a butterfly who carries her waterlily far from the toads;\nhowever, she\u2019s then snatched by a beetle who take her up a tree for company,\nuntil fellow beetles show up and start calling Thumbelina \u201cugly\u201d. Thumbelina\u2019s\nabandoned again and wanders in the forest, making herself clothes from the\ngrass and covering with a fallen leaf when the cold sets in. She finally comes\nacross a mouse\u2019s nest and is taken in by an old mouse who let her stay for the\nwinter. During that time, Thumbelina finds a near-frozen, injured bird that she\nnurses back to health. The old mouse also introduces her to a mole who wants to\nmarry Thumbelina, and although Thumbelina doesn\u2019t want to marry the mole (meaning\nthat she\u2019d live under the earth forever), she\u2019s not really given a choice. The\nday of her wedding, however, the bird she nursed back to life come to take her\naway and bring her to a flower field, where she meets, falls in love with and\nmarry a tiny fairy prince who lives in a flower. </p><p>For analysts Iona and Peter Opie,\nthe moral behind Thumbelina\u2019s story is that people are happier when they\u2019re\nwith their own kind (make sense). Whereas we have Arya as the Little Thumbling\nof Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen would be Thumbelina: she\u2019s \u201cstolen\u201d from her\nhome soon after birth, is betrothed twice to men she has no wish to marry, goes\nfrom places to places, never really fitting in anywhere. Just like Thumbelina\nwho can\u2019t really find her place among toads, beetles and moles, Daenerys never\nreally belongs with the dothraki, the people from Quarth or the meereenese, and\njust like Thumbelina, ends up \u201cflying away\u201d from an unwanted marriage and an\nunhappy home at the end of ADWD. Although nowhere near the size of a thumb (of\ncourse), Daenerys is described as quite small, physically, (and, like\nThumbelina, dainty and beautiful). Moreover, when in the \u201cgreen grass sea\u201d in\nAGOT and ADWD, she could just as well be the size of a thumb, for the grass\ngrows much higher than herself. In ADWD, Daenerys even tries to make herself some\nclothes (a hat) with grass.</p><p>(For those who\u2019ve seen the 1994\nmovie \u201cThumbelina\u201d, you might also remember how Cornelius, the fairy prince who\nmarries Thumbelina, is temporarily frozen in a block of ice. If this doesn\u2019t remind\nus of a certain westerosi prince, I mean bastard, ah, stuck around a big chunk\nof ice for some time.)</p><p>The paradox here lies with\nThumbelina\u2019s connection to seeds, plants and flowers, and the recurring \u201cDragons\nplants no tree\u201d mantra from Daenerys\u2019s story. Still, Thumbelina is a little\ngirl in a shell: she\u2019s born from a barley seed and sleeps in a nutshell (before\nbeing stolen by the toad). Dittos for Daenerys, a dragon in a shell who hatches\nin a sea of grass. ADWD leaves Daenerys in a situation that roughly mirrors\nThumbelina\u2019s forest wanderings at the brink of winter: </p><p><i>In\nthis way <b>the summer and fall went by</b>.\n<b>Then came the winter, the long, cold\nwinter.</b> All the birds who had sung so sweetly for her flew away. The trees\nand the flowers withered. The big burdock leaf under which she had lived\nshriveled up until nothing was left of it but a <b>dry, yellow stalk</b>. She was terribly cold, for <b>her clothes had worn threadbare and she herself was so slender and\nfrail. </b>Poor Thumbelina, she would freeze to death! Snow began to fall, and\nevery time a snowflake struck her it was as if she had been hit by a whole\nshovelful, for we are quite tall while she measured only an inch. <b>She wrapped a withered leaf about her,</b> <b>but there was no warmth in it.</b> <b>She shivered with cold.</b></i></p><p><i>Near\nthe edge of the woods where she now had arrived, was a large grain field, but\nthe grain had been harvested long ago. Only the <b>dry, bare stubble stuck out</b> of the frozen ground. <b>It was just as if she were lost in a vast\nforest,</b> and oh how she shivered with cold! Then she came to the door of a\nfield mouse, who had a little hole amidst the stubble. There this mouse lived,\nwarm and cozy, with a whole store-room of grain, and a magnificent kitchen and\npantry. Poor Thumbelina stood at the door, just like a beggar child, and pled\nfor a little bit of barley, <b>because she\nhadn&rsquo;t had anything to eat for two days past</b>.</i> (H.C. Andersen, <i>Thumbelina</i>)<i></i></p><p>Not to draws too many straws here,\nbut the parallels with Daenerys are there: </p><p><b><i>Dany&rsquo;s clothes were hardly more\nthan rags, and offered little in the way of warmth.</i></b> (\u2026) <i>Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and Dany had torn a strip off\nthe hem to make a bandage for her shin. <b>I\nmust look a ragged thing, and starved</b>, she thought, but if the days stay\nwarm, I will not freeze. </i>(\u2026) <i>She was\nhungry too.</i> (\u2026) <b><i>The grass was as tall as she was</i></b><i>. </i>(\u2026) <i>Though she walked\nthrough a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer. Even here <b>autumn made its presence felt, and winter\nwould not be far behind. The grass was paler than she remembered, a wan and\nsickly green on the verge of going yellow. After that would come brown. The\ngrass was dying. </b></i>(\u2026) <i>&ldquo;I need\na hat,&rdquo; she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had tried to make one for\nherself, <b>weaving stalks of grass\ntogether</b> as she had seen Dothraki women do during her time with Drogo, but\neither she was using the wrong sort of grass or she simply lacked the necessary\nskill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. </i>(\u2026) <b><i>&ldquo;I am lost at sea,&rdquo;</i></b><i> she said</i> (\u2026) <i>Instead <b>she began to shiver</b> <b>violently</b>. </i>(\u2026) <i>She scooped up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. </i>\u2013\nDaenerys, ADWD</p><p>And both girls are rescued from\nthis environment by flying creatures. Little Thumbelina is small enough to\nmount a bird. Daenerys, a girl of \u201cregular\u201d size, mounts a dragon:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes,\nI will go with you!&rdquo; said Thumbelina. <b>She\nsat on his back, put her feet on his outstretched wings, and fastened her sash\nto one of his strongest feathers. Then the swallow soared into the air </b>over\nforests and over lakes, high up over the great mountains that are always capped\nwith snow. When Thumbelina felt cold in the chill air, she crept under the\nbird&rsquo;s warm feathers, with only her little head stuck out to watch all the\nwonderful sights below. </i>(H.C.\nAndersen, <i>Thumbelina</i>)</p><p><i>Dany\nleapt onto his back. She stank of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that\nmattered. &ldquo;To go forward I must go back,&rdquo; she said. Her bare legs tightened\naround the dragon&rsquo;s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the\nsky.</i> \u2013 Daenerys,\nADWD</p><p>Thumbelina flies to a country of\neternal spring, where she meets the fairy prince and gets her happily ever\nafter. The bird who carried her is sad nonetheless because she chose the fairy\nprince over him. </p><p>From what we know, Daenerys will\nsoon be flying to a country threatened by eternal winter, where she will meet a\nprince (Jon) who connects both with flowers (the \u201cblue flower from a chunk of\nice\u201d) and snow. </p><p>These are, so far, Arya\u2019s and\nDaenerys\u2019s journeys back home. <br/></p>",

In Braavos, Arya steals boots (presumably her size \u2013 we\u2019re told\nthat the boots she previously wore were too big for her) from a Night\u2019s Watch\ndeserter, and cuts a purse in ADWD. </p><p><i>Someone\nslit his throat and pushed him into a canal, but they kept his boots.\u201c</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\"Good boots are hard to find.\u201d</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust so.\u201d She tried to keep her\nface still.</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho could have done this thing, I\nwonder?\u201d</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cArya of House Stark.\u201d She watched\nhis eyes, his mouth, the muscles of his jaw. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC<br></p><p><i>\n\nShe slipped her hand through the gap, slit the purse open with the finger knife, filled her fist with gold \u2026</i> - The ugly little girl, ADWD<br></p><p>As we can see, there\u2019s a lot of\nparallels and foils here. I tend to view the <i>boots </i>as a coming-of-age achievement and a symbol of empowerment,\nbut in my opinion, Arya\u2019s story goes beyond that: she wants to go home and the\n\u201cogre\u201d is the main obstacle to that quest. Her story arc in Westeros more or\nless culminate with the events at the Twins (her encounter with the ogre),\nwhere she powerlessly witnesses the slaughter of her family. The rest is details: she takes her revenge on Polliver and get her\nNeedle back, which symbolically marks the end of her peregrinations as a\nprisoner. She frees herself from the Hound (another \u201cogre\u201d figure, though this\none is more ambivalent). Then she leaves. She embarks on another storyline with\nanother \u201cogre\u201d, the Titan of Braavos, who \u201ceat the flesh of little highborn\ngirls\u201d. Braavos, essentially \u2013 what lays behind the Titan \u2013 is another ogre\u2019s\nhouse: </p><p><i>Even\nso, she kept one hand on Needle as they slipped between his legs. More arrow\nslits dotted the insides of those great stone thighs, and when Arya craned her\nneck around to watch the crow\u2019s nest slip through with a good ten yards to\nspare, she spied murder holes beneath the Titan\u2019s armored skirts, and pale\nfaces staring down at them from behind the iron bars.</i></p><p><i>And\nthen they were past.</i>\n\u2013 Arya, AFFC</p><p>The House of Black and White also\ntries to \u201ceat\u201d Arya\u2019s family: Arya must forget about her mother. She must\nforget about her brothers. She must forget about herself and become No One. She\nmust rid herself of her belonging. This time, nonetheless, she outwits the ogre\nby hiding her most precious possession (Needle) from him. The House of Black\nand White shares another similarity with the ogre\u2019s house, for few who enters\never get out \u2013 actually, one could even make a case of the House of Black and\nWhite \u201cdigesting\u201d those who came to die there: the servants clean the dead,\ntake their purses, coins, clothes, and the faces are taken down a labyrinthine\nweb of stairs, halls, doors underground (the \u201cintestines\u201d) before ending up in\nthe Hall of Faces (as \u201cnourishment\u201d for the House of Black and White). There\u2019s\neven a short scene in AFFC where Arya fears that the meat she\u2019s given for her\nsupper is actually the flesh of the dead (before the kindly man reassures her\nthat it\u2019s only pork). </p><p>Arya\u2019s Little Thumbling can be\ntaken as a criticism of the patriarchy displayed in the original tale: the\nwoodcutter\u2019s wife and the ogre\u2019s wife are both depicted as passive victims of\ntheir husbands\u2019 cruelty (the woodcutter\u2019s wife tries to dissuade her husband\nfrom abandoning their children in the forest, but to no avail). The good\nmother/cruel father dichotomy is quite present in Arya\u2019s storyline, especially\nin Westeros (the good mother Catelyn and the Hound, the meek lady Frey and the\nbig bad Walder). Thus, it\u2019s interesting that the Little Thumbling of Westeros\nis in fact a little girl disguised as a boy. It\u2019s also curious that Arya\nherself takes the role of a mother to \u201cWeasel\u201d. And, as far as parents go, the Little\nThumbling is also a story about the validation of the hero/heroine to his/her\nfamily: the sickly, skinny, useless Little Thumbling save his siblings from an\nogre and presents a bag of gold to his parents at the end of the story. Arya\n\u201cHorseface\u201d Stark, the little sister who can\u2019t sew, can\u2019t stitch, can\u2019t draw or\nsing, would\u2019ve attempted (truly) to save her mother and brother by herself at\nthe Twins \u2013 something the Hound scoffs at, because unfortunately, Arya\u2019s story\nisn\u2019t a fairy tale\u2026</p><p><i>\n\n\u201cWe should go back,\u201d she suddenly decided. \u201cWe should go back to the Twins and get my mother. She can\u2019t be dead. We have to help her.\"\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\"I thought your sister was the one with a head full of songs,\u201d the Hound growled. \u201cFrey might have kept your mother alive to ransom, that\u2019s true. But there\u2019s no way in seven hells I\u2019m going to pluck her out of his castle all by my bloody self.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0\"Not by yourself. I\u2019d come too.\u201c\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He made a sound that was almost a laugh. \"That will scare the piss out of the old man.\u201d - </i>Arya, ASOS<br></p><p>The Little Thumbling is <i>also</i> one of these stories where the hero\u2019s\n\u201cquest\u201d centers around returning home. Another story of the same style would be\n<i>Thumbelina</i>: a tiny girl, the size of\na thumb, is born inside a flower, stolen by a toad who wants to marry her to\nher son, and left on a waterlily so she can\u2019t escape. She receives help from\nsome fishes and a butterfly who carries her waterlily far from the toads;\nhowever, she\u2019s then snatched by a beetle who take her up a tree for company,\nuntil fellow beetles show up and start calling Thumbelina \u201cugly\u201d. Thumbelina\u2019s\nabandoned again and wanders in the forest, making herself clothes from the\ngrass and covering with a fallen leaf when the cold sets in. She finally comes\nacross a mouse\u2019s nest and is taken in by an old mouse who let her stay for the\nwinter. During that time, Thumbelina finds a near-frozen, injured bird that she\nnurses back to health. The old mouse also introduces her to a mole who wants to\nmarry Thumbelina, and although Thumbelina doesn\u2019t want to marry the mole (meaning\nthat she\u2019d live under the earth forever), she\u2019s not really given a choice. The\nday of her wedding, however, the bird she nursed back to life come to take her\naway and bring her to a flower field, where she meets, falls in love with and\nmarry a tiny fairy prince who lives in a flower. </p><p>For analysts Iona and Peter Opie,\nthe moral behind Thumbelina\u2019s story is that people are happier when they\u2019re\nwith their own kind (make sense). Whereas we have Arya as the Little Thumbling\nof Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen would be Thumbelina: she\u2019s \u201cstolen\u201d from her\nhome soon after birth, is betrothed twice to men she has no wish to marry, goes\nfrom places to places, never really fitting in anywhere. Just like Thumbelina\nwho can\u2019t really find her place among toads, beetles and moles, Daenerys never\nreally belongs with the dothraki, the people from Quarth or the meereenese, and\njust like Thumbelina, ends up \u201cflying away\u201d from an unwanted marriage and an\nunhappy home at the end of ADWD. Although nowhere near the size of a thumb (of\ncourse), Daenerys is described as quite small, physically, (and, like\nThumbelina, dainty and beautiful). Moreover, when in the \u201cgreen grass sea\u201d in\nAGOT and ADWD, she could just as well be the size of a thumb, for the grass\ngrows much higher than herself. In ADWD, Daenerys even tries to make herself some\nclothes (a hat) with grass.</p><p>(For those who\u2019ve seen the 1994\nmovie \u201cThumbelina\u201d, you might also remember how Cornelius, the fairy prince who\nmarries Thumbelina, is temporarily frozen in a block of ice. If this doesn\u2019t remind\nus of a certain westerosi prince, I mean bastard, ah, stuck around a big chunk\nof ice for some time.)</p><p>The paradox here lies with\nThumbelina\u2019s connection to seeds, plants and flowers, and the recurring \u201cDragons\nplants no tree\u201d mantra from Daenerys\u2019s story. Still, Thumbelina is a little\ngirl in a shell: she\u2019s born from a barley seed and sleeps in a nutshell (before\nbeing stolen by the toad). Dittos for Daenerys, a dragon in a shell who hatches\nin a sea of grass. ADWD leaves Daenerys in a situation that roughly mirrors\nThumbelina\u2019s forest wanderings at the brink of winter: </p><p><i>In\nthis way <b>the summer and fall went by</b>.\n<b>Then came the winter, the long, cold\nwinter.</b> All the birds who had sung so sweetly for her flew away. The trees\nand the flowers withered. The big burdock leaf under which she had lived\nshriveled up until nothing was left of it but a <b>dry, yellow stalk</b>. She was terribly cold, for <b>her clothes had worn threadbare and she herself was so slender and\nfrail. </b>Poor Thumbelina, she would freeze to death! Snow began to fall, and\nevery time a snowflake struck her it was as if she had been hit by a whole\nshovelful, for we are quite tall while she measured only an inch. <b>She wrapped a withered leaf about her,</b> <b>but there was no warmth in it.</b> <b>She shivered with cold.</b></i></p><p><i>Near\nthe edge of the woods where she now had arrived, was a large grain field, but\nthe grain had been harvested long ago. Only the <b>dry, bare stubble stuck out</b> of the frozen ground. <b>It was just as if she were lost in a vast\nforest,</b> and oh how she shivered with cold! Then she came to the door of a\nfield mouse, who had a little hole amidst the stubble. There this mouse lived,\nwarm and cozy, with a whole store-room of grain, and a magnificent kitchen and\npantry. Poor Thumbelina stood at the door, just like a beggar child, and pled\nfor a little bit of barley, <b>because she\nhadn\u2019t had anything to eat for two days past</b>.</i> (H.C. Andersen, <i>Thumbelina</i>)<i></i></p><p>Not to draws too many straws here,\nbut the parallels with Daenerys are there: </p><p><b><i>Dany\u2019s clothes were hardly more\nthan rags, and offered little in the way of warmth.</i></b> (\u2026) <i>Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and Dany had torn a strip off\nthe hem to make a bandage for her shin. <b>I\nmust look a ragged thing, and starved</b>, she thought, but if the days stay\nwarm, I will not freeze. </i>(\u2026) <i>She was\nhungry too.</i> (\u2026) <b><i>The grass was as tall as she was</i></b><i>. </i>(\u2026) <i>Though she walked\nthrough a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer. Even here <b>autumn made its presence felt, and winter\nwould not be far behind. The grass was paler than she remembered, a wan and\nsickly green on the verge of going yellow. After that would come brown. The\ngrass was dying. </b></i>(\u2026) <i>\u201cI need\na hat,\u201d she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had tried to make one for\nherself, <b>weaving stalks of grass\ntogether</b> as she had seen Dothraki women do during her time with Drogo, but\neither she was using the wrong sort of grass or she simply lacked the necessary\nskill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. </i>(\u2026) <b><i>\u201cI am lost at sea,\u201d</i></b><i> she said</i> (\u2026) <i>Instead <b>she began to shiver</b> <b>violently</b>. </i>(\u2026) <i>She scooped up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. </i>\u2013\nDaenerys, ADWD</p><p>And both girls are rescued from\nthis environment by flying creatures. Little Thumbelina is small enough to\nmount a bird. Daenerys, a girl of \u201cregular\u201d size, mounts a dragon:</p><p><i>\u201cYes,\nI will go with you!\u201d said Thumbelina. <b>She\nsat on his back, put her feet on his outstretched wings, and fastened her sash\nto one of his strongest feathers. Then the swallow soared into the air </b>over\nforests and over lakes, high up over the great mountains that are always capped\nwith snow. When Thumbelina felt cold in the chill air, she crept under the\nbird\u2019s warm feathers, with only her little head stuck out to watch all the\nwonderful sights below. </i>(H.C.\nAndersen, <i>Thumbelina</i>)</p><p><i>Dany\nleapt onto his back. She stank of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that\nmattered. \u201cTo go forward I must go back,\u201d she said. Her bare legs tightened\naround the dragon\u2019s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the\nsky.</i> \u2013 Daenerys,\nADWD</p><p>Thumbelina flies to a country of\neternal spring, where she meets the fairy prince and gets her happily ever\nafter. The bird who carried her is sad nonetheless because she chose the fairy\nprince over him. </p><p>From what we know, Daenerys will\nsoon be flying to a country threatened by eternal winter, where she will meet a\nprince (Jon) who connects both with flowers (the \u201cblue flower from a chunk of\nice\u201d) and snow. </p><p>These are, so far, Arya\u2019s and\nDaenerys\u2019s journeys back home. <br></p>",

The parents decide to abandon them in the forest, but <b>Little Thumbling manages to find their way\nback by leaving pebbles behind him.</b> Later on, knowing that their parents\nwill want to abandon them in the forest again, he tries to sneak outside early\nto get more pebbles, but since the door is locked, must do with crumbs from the\nbreakfast\u2019s bread. Unfortunately, <b>the\nbirds eat the crumbs and Little Thumbling and his siblings can\u2019t find their way\nbac</b>k. They eventually come across an ogre\u2019s house and ask for shelter\nbecause<b> there\u2019s wolves in the forest</b>.\nThe ogre\u2019s wife let them in, feed them, and all is good until <b>the ogre comes back and decides to have the\nchildren for his supper</b>. His wife persuades him otherwise by presenting him\nwith <b>pork, veal and muttons</b>, and <b>Little Thumbling and his siblings are given\na bed for the night, next to the bed shared by the ogre\u2019s seven daughters \u2013 all\nwearing golden crowns. Worrying that the ogre might want to slaughter his\n\u201cguests\u201d during the night, Little Thumbling wait until the ogre\u2019s daughters are\nasleep to switch their crowns with his own brothers\u2019 hats.

In Braavos, Arya steals boots (presumably her size \u2013 we\u2019re told\nthat the boots she previously wore were too big for her) from a Night\u2019s Watch\ndeserter, and cuts a purse in ADWD. </p><p><i>Someone\nslit his throat and pushed him into a canal, but they kept his boots.\u201c</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\"Good boots are hard to find.\u201d</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust so.\u201d She tried to keep her\nface still.</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho could have done this thing, I\nwonder?\u201d</i><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cArya of House Stark.\u201d She watched\nhis eyes, his mouth, the muscles of his jaw. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC<br></p><p><i>\n\nShe slipped her hand through the gap, slit the purse open with the finger knife, filled her fist with gold \u2026</i> - The ugly little girl, ADWD<br></p><p>As we can see, there\u2019s a lot of\nparallels and foils here. I tend to view the <i>boots </i>as a coming-of-age achievement and a symbol of empowerment,\nbut in my opinion, Arya\u2019s story goes beyond that: she wants to go home and the\n\u201cogre\u201d is the main obstacle to that quest. Her story arc in Westeros more or\nless culminate with the events at the Twins (her encounter with the ogre),\nwhere she powerlessly witnesses the slaughter of her family. The rest is details: she takes her revenge on Polliver and get her\nNeedle back, which symbolically marks the end of her peregrinations as a\nprisoner. She frees herself from the Hound (another \u201cogre\u201d figure, though this\none is more ambivalent). Then she leaves. She embarks on another storyline with\nanother \u201cogre\u201d, the Titan of Braavos, who \u201ceat the flesh of little highborn\ngirls\u201d. Braavos, essentially \u2013 what lays behind the Titan \u2013 is another ogre\u2019s\nhouse: </p><p><i>Even\nso, she kept one hand on Needle as they slipped between his legs. More arrow\nslits dotted the insides of those great stone thighs, and when Arya craned her\nneck around to watch the crow\u2019s nest slip through with a good ten yards to\nspare, she spied murder holes beneath the Titan\u2019s armored skirts, and pale\nfaces staring down at them from behind the iron bars.</i></p><p><i>And\nthen they were past.</i>\n\u2013 Arya, AFFC</p><p>The House of Black and White also\ntries to \u201ceat\u201d Arya\u2019s family: Arya must forget about her mother. She must\nforget about her brothers. She must forget about herself and become No One. She\nmust rid herself of her belonging. This time, nonetheless, she outwits the ogre\nby hiding her most precious possession (Needle) from him. The House of Black\nand White shares another similarity with the ogre\u2019s house, for few who enters\never get out \u2013 actually, one could even make a case of the House of Black and\nWhite \u201cdigesting\u201d those who came to die there: the servants clean the dead,\ntake their purses, coins, clothes, and the faces are taken down a labyrinthine\nweb of stairs, halls, doors underground (the \u201cintestines\u201d) before ending up in\nthe Hall of Faces (as \u201cnourishment\u201d for the House of Black and White). There\u2019s\neven a short scene in AFFC where Arya fears that the meat she\u2019s given for her\nsupper is actually the flesh of the dead (before the kindly man reassures her\nthat it\u2019s only pork). </p><p>Arya\u2019s Little Thumbling can be\ntaken as a criticism of the patriarchy displayed in the original tale: the\nwoodcutter\u2019s wife and the ogre\u2019s wife are both depicted as passive victims of\ntheir husbands\u2019 cruelty (the woodcutter\u2019s wife tries to dissuade her husband\nfrom abandoning their children in the forest, but to no avail). The good\nmother/cruel father dichotomy is quite present in Arya\u2019s storyline, especially\nin Westeros (the good mother Catelyn and the Hound, the meek lady Frey and the\nbig bad Walder). Thus, it\u2019s interesting that the Little Thumbling of Westeros\nis in fact a little girl disguised as a boy. It\u2019s also curious that Arya\nherself takes the role of a mother to \u201cWeasel\u201d. And, as far as parents go, the Little\nThumbling is also a story about the validation of the hero/heroine to his/her\nfamily: the sickly, skinny, useless Little Thumbling save his siblings from an\nogre and presents a bag of gold to his parents at the end of the story. Arya\n\u201cHorseface\u201d Stark, the little sister who can\u2019t sew, can\u2019t stitch, can\u2019t draw or\nsing, would\u2019ve attempted (truly) to save her mother and brother by herself at\nthe Twins \u2013 something the Hound scoffs at, because unfortunately, Arya\u2019s story\nisn\u2019t a fairy tale\u2026</p><p><i>\n\n\u201cWe should go back,\u201d she suddenly decided. \u201cWe should go back to the Twins and get my mother. She can\u2019t be dead. We have to help her.\"\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\"I thought your sister was the one with a head full of songs,\u201d the Hound growled. \u201cFrey might have kept your mother alive to ransom, that\u2019s true. But there\u2019s no way in seven hells I\u2019m going to pluck her out of his castle all by my bloody self.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0\"Not by yourself. I\u2019d come too.\u201c\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He made a sound that was almost a laugh. \"That will scare the piss out of the old man.\u201d - </i>Arya, ASOS<br></p><p>The Little Thumbling is <i>also</i> one of these stories where the hero\u2019s\n\u201cquest\u201d centers around returning home. Another story of the same style would be\n<i>Thumbelina</i>: a tiny girl, the size of\na thumb, is born inside a flower, stolen by a toad who wants to marry her to\nher son, and left on a waterlily so she can\u2019t escape. She receives help from\nsome fishes and a butterfly who carries her waterlily far from the toads;\nhowever, she\u2019s then snatched by a beetle who take her up a tree for company,\nuntil fellow beetles show up and start calling Thumbelina \u201cugly\u201d. Thumbelina\u2019s\nabandoned again and wanders in the forest, making herself clothes from the\ngrass and covering with a fallen leaf when the cold sets in. She finally comes\nacross a mouse\u2019s nest and is taken in by an old mouse who let her stay for the\nwinter. During that time, Thumbelina finds a near-frozen, injured bird that she\nnurses back to health. The old mouse also introduces her to a mole who wants to\nmarry Thumbelina, and although Thumbelina doesn\u2019t want to marry the mole (meaning\nthat she\u2019d live under the earth forever), she\u2019s not really given a choice. The\nday of her wedding, however, the bird she nursed back to life come to take her\naway and bring her to a flower field, where she meets, falls in love with and\nmarry a tiny fairy prince who lives in a flower. </p><p>For analysts Iona and Peter Opie,\nthe moral behind Thumbelina\u2019s story is that people are happier when they\u2019re\nwith their own kind (make sense). Whereas we have Arya as the Little Thumbling\nof Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen would be Thumbelina: she\u2019s \u201cstolen\u201d from her\nhome soon after birth, is betrothed twice to men she has no wish to marry, goes\nfrom places to places, never really fitting in anywhere. Just like Thumbelina\nwho can\u2019t really find her place among toads, beetles and moles, Daenerys never\nreally belongs with the dothraki, the people from Quarth or the meereenese, and\njust like Thumbelina, ends up \u201cflying away\u201d from an unwanted marriage and an\nunhappy home at the end of ADWD. Although nowhere near the size of a thumb (of\ncourse), Daenerys is described as quite small, physically, (and, like\nThumbelina, dainty and beautiful). Moreover, when in the \u201cgreen grass sea\u201d in\nAGOT and ADWD, she could just as well be the size of a thumb, for the grass\ngrows much higher than herself. In ADWD, Daenerys even tries to make herself some\nclothes (a hat) with grass.</p><p>(For those who\u2019ve seen the 1994\nmovie \u201cThumbelina\u201d, you might also remember how Cornelius, the fairy prince who\nmarries Thumbelina, is temporarily frozen in a block of ice. If this doesn\u2019t remind\nus of a certain westerosi prince, I mean bastard, ah, stuck around a big chunk\nof ice for some time.)</p><p>The paradox here lies with\nThumbelina\u2019s connection to seeds, plants and flowers, and the recurring \u201cDragons\nplants no tree\u201d mantra from Daenerys\u2019s story. Still, Thumbelina is a little\ngirl in a shell: she\u2019s born from a barley seed and sleeps in a nutshell (before\nbeing stolen by the toad). Dittos for Daenerys, a dragon in a shell who hatches\nin a sea of grass. ADWD leaves Daenerys in a situation that roughly mirrors\nThumbelina\u2019s forest wanderings at the brink of winter: </p><p><i>In\nthis way <b>the summer and fall went by</b>.\n<b>Then came the winter, the long, cold\nwinter.</b> All the birds who had sung so sweetly for her flew away. The trees\nand the flowers withered. The big burdock leaf under which she had lived\nshriveled up until nothing was left of it but a <b>dry, yellow stalk</b>. She was terribly cold, for <b>her clothes had worn threadbare and she herself was so slender and\nfrail. </b>Poor Thumbelina, she would freeze to death! Snow began to fall, and\nevery time a snowflake struck her it was as if she had been hit by a whole\nshovelful, for we are quite tall while she measured only an inch. <b>She wrapped a withered leaf about her,</b> <b>but there was no warmth in it.</b> <b>She shivered with cold.</b></i></p><p><i>Near\nthe edge of the woods where she now had arrived, was a large grain field, but\nthe grain had been harvested long ago. Only the <b>dry, bare stubble stuck out</b> of the frozen ground. <b>It was just as if she were lost in a vast\nforest,</b> and oh how she shivered with cold! Then she came to the door of a\nfield mouse, who had a little hole amidst the stubble. There this mouse lived,\nwarm and cozy, with a whole store-room of grain, and a magnificent kitchen and\npantry. Poor Thumbelina stood at the door, just like a beggar child, and pled\nfor a little bit of barley, <b>because she\nhadn\u2019t had anything to eat for two days past</b>.</i> (H.C. Andersen, <i>Thumbelina</i>)<i></i></p><p>Not to draws too many straws here,\nbut the parallels with Daenerys are there: </p><p><b><i>Dany\u2019s clothes were hardly more\nthan rags, and offered little in the way of warmth.</i></b> (\u2026) <i>Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and Dany had torn a strip off\nthe hem to make a bandage for her shin. <b>I\nmust look a ragged thing, and starved</b>, she thought, but if the days stay\nwarm, I will not freeze. </i>(\u2026) <i>She was\nhungry too.</i> (\u2026) <b><i>The grass was as tall as she was</i></b><i>. </i>(\u2026) <i>Though she walked\nthrough a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer. Even here <b>autumn made its presence felt, and winter\nwould not be far behind. The grass was paler than she remembered, a wan and\nsickly green on the verge of going yellow. After that would come brown. The\ngrass was dying. </b></i>(\u2026) <i>\u201cI need\na hat,\u201d she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had tried to make one for\nherself, <b>weaving stalks of grass\ntogether</b> as she had seen Dothraki women do during her time with Drogo, but\neither she was using the wrong sort of grass or she simply lacked the necessary\nskill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. </i>(\u2026) <b><i>\u201cI am lost at sea,\u201d</i></b><i> she said</i> (\u2026) <i>Instead <b>she began to shiver</b> <b>violently</b>. </i>(\u2026) <i>She scooped up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. </i>\u2013\nDaenerys, ADWD</p><p>And both girls are rescued from\nthis environment by flying creatures. Little Thumbelina is small enough to\nmount a bird. Daenerys, a girl of \u201cregular\u201d size, mounts a dragon:</p><p><i>\u201cYes,\nI will go with you!\u201d said Thumbelina. <b>She\nsat on his back, put her feet on his outstretched wings, and fastened her sash\nto one of his strongest feathers. Then the swallow soared into the air </b>over\nforests and over lakes, high up over the great mountains that are always capped\nwith snow. When Thumbelina felt cold in the chill air, she crept under the\nbird\u2019s warm feathers, with only her little head stuck out to watch all the\nwonderful sights below. </i>(H.C.\nAndersen, <i>Thumbelina</i>)</p><p><i>Dany\nleapt onto his back. She stank of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that\nmattered. \u201cTo go forward I must go back,\u201d she said. Her bare legs tightened\naround the dragon\u2019s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the\nsky.</i> \u2013 Daenerys,\nADWD</p><p>Thumbelina flies to a country of\neternal spring, where she meets the fairy prince and gets her happily ever\nafter. The bird who carried her is sad nonetheless because she chose the fairy\nprince over him. </p><p>From what we know, Daenerys will\nsoon be flying to a country threatened by eternal winter, where she will meet a\nprince (Jon) who connects both with flowers (the \u201cblue flower from a chunk of\nice\u201d) and snow. </p><p>These are, so far, Arya\u2019s and\nDaenerys\u2019s journeys back home. <br></p>",

The parents decide to abandon them in the forest, but <b>Little Thumbling manages to find their way\nback by leaving pebbles behind him.</b> Later on, knowing that their parents\nwill want to abandon them in the forest again, he tries to sneak outside early\nto get more pebbles, but since the door is locked, must do with crumbs from the\nbreakfast&rsquo;s bread.

Robb is coerced into leaving his\ndirewolf outside at the Twins. </p><p><i>\n\nThe sight of the dogs made Catelyn wish once more for Grey Wind, but Robb&rsquo;s direwolf was nowhere to be seen. Lord Walder had refused to allow him in the hall.</i>&nbsp;- Catelyn, ASOS</p><p>-Little Thumbling and his brothers\nare offered food and a bed at the ogre&rsquo;s house. Catelyn, Robb and his men are\noffered guests&rsquo; rights at the Twins. The ogre&rsquo;s wife knows that her husband\neats children, but can&rsquo;t do anything about it. Roslin Frey <i>probably</i> knew about her father&rsquo;s plan to slaughter the Starks after\nthe wedding, but couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it either. </p><p>-The ogre slices his daughter&rsquo;s\nthroats after feeling the boys&rsquo; hats on their heads. Walder Frey let Catelyn\nslice his grandson&rsquo;s throat, the one surnamed &ldquo;Jinglebell&rdquo; for the bell hat\nthat he wore. </p><p><i>\n\nRobb had broken his word, but Catelyn kept hers. She tugged hard on Aegon&rsquo;s hair and sawed at his neck until the blade grated on bone. Blood ran hot over her fingers. His little bells were ringing, ringing, ringing, and the drum went boom doom boom.</i> - Catelyn, ASOS<br /></p><p>*This only concerns the show so\nfar, but we have another scene where &ldquo;Walder Frey&rdquo; slaughter his own children:</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>-Little Thumbling and his brothers\nflee on time. So does Arya at the Twins (with a bit of help from the Hound),\nbut she doesn&rsquo;t manage to save her mother, nor her brother. </p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she shouted. Her voice sounded thin and scared, a little girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Robb&rsquo;s just in the castle, and my mother. The gate&rsquo;s even open.&rdquo; There were no more Freys riding out. </i>I came so far<i>. &ldquo;We have to go get my mother.&rdquo;</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Stupid little bitch.&rdquo; Fires glinted off the snout of his helm, and made the steel teeth shine. &ldquo;You go in there, you won&rsquo;t come out. Maybe Frey will let you kiss your mother&rsquo;s corpse.&rdquo; </i>- Arya, ASOS<br /></p><p>-Little Thumbling steal the ogre&rsquo;s\nboots, whose size magically adjusts to his feet, and also steals gold from the\nogre&rsquo;s wife. In Braavos, Arya steals boots (presumably her size &ndash; we&rsquo;re told\nthat the boots she previously wore were too big for her) from a Night&rsquo;s Watch\ndeserter, and cuts a purse in ADWD. </p><p><i>Someone\nslit his throat and pushed him into a canal, but they kept his boots.&ldquo;</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>\"Good boots are hard to find.&rdquo;</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo; She tried to keep her\nface still.</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Who could have done this thing, I\nwonder?&rdquo;</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Arya of House Stark.&rdquo; She watched\nhis eyes, his mouth, the muscles of his jaw. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC<br /></p><p><i>\n\nShe slipped her hand through the gap, slit the purse open with the finger knife, filled her fist with gold &hellip;</i> - The ugly little girl, ADWD<br /></p><p>As we can see, there&rsquo;s a lot of\nparallels and foils here. I tend to view the <i>boots </i>as a coming-of-age achievement and a symbol of empowerment,\nbut in my opinion, Arya&rsquo;s story goes beyond that: she wants to go home and the\n&ldquo;ogre&rdquo; is the main obstacle to that quest. Her story arc in Westeros more or\nless culminate with the events at the Twins (her encounter with the ogre),\nwhere she powerlessly witnesses the slaughter of her family. The rest is details: she takes her revenge on Polliver and get her\nNeedle back, which symbolically marks the end of her peregrinations as a\nprisoner. She frees herself from the Hound (another &ldquo;ogre&rdquo; figure, though this\none is more ambivalent). Then she leaves. She embarks on another storyline with\nanother &ldquo;ogre&rdquo;, the Titan of Braavos, who &ldquo;eat the flesh of little highborn\ngirls&rdquo;. Braavos, essentially &ndash; what lays behind the Titan &ndash; is another ogre&rsquo;s\nhouse: </p><p><i>Even\nso, she kept one hand on Needle as they slipped between his legs. More arrow\nslits dotted the insides of those great stone thighs, and when Arya craned her\nneck around to watch the crow&rsquo;s nest slip through with a good ten yards to\nspare, she spied murder holes beneath the Titan&rsquo;s armored skirts, and pale\nfaces staring down at them from behind the iron bars.</i></p><p><i>And\nthen they were past.</i>\n&ndash; Arya, AFFC</p><p>The House of Black and White also\ntries to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; Arya&rsquo;s family: Arya must forget about her mother. She must\nforget about her brothers. She must forget about herself and become No One. She\nmust rid herself of her belonging. This time, nonetheless, she outwits the ogre\nby hiding her most precious possession (Needle) from him. The House of Black\nand White shares another similarity with the ogre&rsquo;s house, for few who enters\never get out &ndash; actually, one could even make a case of the House of Black and\nWhite &ldquo;digesting&rdquo; those who came to die there: the servants clean the dead,\ntake their purses, coins, clothes, and the faces are taken down a labyrinthine\nweb of stairs, halls, doors underground (the &ldquo;intestines&rdquo;) before ending up in\nthe Hall of Faces (as &ldquo;nourishment&rdquo; for the House of Black and White). There&rsquo;s\neven a short scene in AFFC where Arya fears that the meat she&rsquo;s given for her\nsupper is actually the flesh of the dead (before the kindly man reassures her\nthat it&rsquo;s only pork). </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s Little Thumbling can be\ntaken as a criticism of the patriarchy displayed in the original tale: the\nwoodcutter&rsquo;s wife and the ogre&rsquo;s wife are both depicted as passive victims of\ntheir husbands&rsquo; cruelty (the woodcutter&rsquo;s wife tries to dissuade her husband\nfrom abandoning their children in the forest, but to no avail). The good\nmother/cruel father dichotomy is quite present in Arya&rsquo;s storyline, especially\nin Westeros (the good mother Catelyn and the Hound, the meek lady Frey and the\nbig bad Walder). Thus, it&rsquo;s interesting that the Little Thumbling of Westeros\nis in fact a little girl disguised as a boy. It&rsquo;s also curious that Arya\nherself takes the role of a mother to &ldquo;Weasel&rdquo;. And, as far as parents go, the Little\nThumbling is also a story about the validation of the hero/heroine to his/her\nfamily: the sickly, skinny, useless Little Thumbling save his siblings from an\nogre and presents a bag of gold to his parents at the end of the story. Arya\n&ldquo;Horseface&rdquo; Stark, the little sister who can&rsquo;t sew, can&rsquo;t stitch, can&rsquo;t draw or\nsing, would&rsquo;ve attempted (truly) to save her mother and brother by herself at\nthe Twins &ndash; something the Hound scoffs at, because unfortunately, Arya&rsquo;s story\nisn&rsquo;t a fairy tale&hellip;</p><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;We should go back,&rdquo; she suddenly decided. &ldquo;We should go back to the Twins and get my mother. She can&rsquo;t be dead. We have to help her.\"&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>\"I thought your sister was the one with a head full of songs,&rdquo; the Hound growled. &ldquo;Frey might have kept your mother alive to ransom, that&rsquo;s true. But there&rsquo;s no way in seven hells I&rsquo;m going to pluck her out of his castle all by my bloody self.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;\"Not by yourself. I&rsquo;d come too.&ldquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He made a sound that was almost a laugh. \"That will scare the piss out of the old man.&rdquo; - </i>Arya, ASOS<br /></p><p>The Little Thumbling is <i>also</i> one of these stories where the hero&rsquo;s\n&ldquo;quest&rdquo; centers around returning home. Another story of the same style would be\n<i>Thumbelina</i>: a tiny girl, the size of\na thumb, is born inside a flower, stolen by a toad who wants to marry her to\nher son, and left on a waterlily so she can&rsquo;t escape. She receives help from\nsome fishes and a butterfly who carries her waterlily far from the toads;\nhowever, she&rsquo;s then snatched by a beetle who take her up a tree for company,\nuntil fellow beetles show up and start calling Thumbelina &ldquo;ugly&rdquo;. Thumbelina&rsquo;s\nabandoned again and wanders in the forest, making herself clothes from the\ngrass and covering with a fallen leaf when the cold sets in. She finally comes\nacross a mouse&rsquo;s nest and is taken in by an old mouse who let her stay for the\nwinter. During that time, Thumbelina finds a near-frozen, injured bird that she\nnurses back to health. The old mouse also introduces her to a mole who wants to\nmarry Thumbelina, and although Thumbelina doesn&rsquo;t want to marry the mole (meaning\nthat she&rsquo;d live under the earth forever), she&rsquo;s not really given a choice. The\nday of her wedding, however, the bird she nursed back to life come to take her\naway and bring her to a flower field, where she meets, falls in love with and\nmarry a tiny fairy prince who lives in a flower. </p><p>For analysts Iona and Peter Opie,\nthe moral behind Thumbelina&rsquo;s story is that people are happier when they&rsquo;re\nwith their own kind (make sense). Whereas we have Arya as the Little Thumbling\nof Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen would be Thumbelina: she&rsquo;s &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; from her\nhome soon after birth, is betrothed twice to men she has no wish to marry, goes\nfrom places to places, never really fitting in anywhere. Just like Thumbelina\nwho can&rsquo;t really find her place among toads, beetles and moles, Daenerys never\nreally belongs with the dothraki, the people from Quarth or the meereenese, and\njust like Thumbelina, ends up &ldquo;flying away&rdquo; from an unwanted marriage and an\nunhappy home at the end of ADWD. Although nowhere near the size of a thumb (of\ncourse), Daenerys is described as quite small, physically, (and, like\nThumbelina, dainty and beautiful). Moreover, when in the &ldquo;green grass sea&rdquo; in\nAGOT and ADWD, she could just as well be the size of a thumb, for the grass\ngrows much higher than herself. In ADWD, Daenerys even tries to make herself some\nclothes (a hat) with grass.</p><p>(For those who&rsquo;ve seen the 1994\nmovie &ldquo;Thumbelina&rdquo;, you might also remember how Cornelius, the fairy prince who\nmarries Thumbelina, is temporarily frozen in a block of ice. If this doesn&rsquo;t remind\nus of a certain westerosi prince, I mean bastard, ah, stuck around a big chunk\nof ice for some time.)</p><p>The paradox here lies with\nThumbelina&rsquo;s connection to seeds, plants and flowers, and the recurring &ldquo;Dragons\nplants no tree&rdquo; mantra from Daenerys&rsquo;s story. Still, Thumbelina is a little\ngirl in a shell: she&rsquo;s born from a barley seed and sleeps in a nutshell (before\nbeing stolen by the toad). Dittos for Daenerys, a dragon in a shell who hatches\nin a sea of grass. ADWD leaves Daenerys in a situation that roughly mirrors\nThumbelina&rsquo;s forest wanderings at the brink of winter: </p><p><i>In\nthis way <b>the summer and fall went by</b>.\n<b>Then came the winter, the long, cold\nwinter.</b> All the birds who had sung so sweetly for her flew away. The trees\nand the flowers withered. The big burdock leaf under which she had lived\nshriveled up until nothing was left of it but a <b>dry, yellow stalk</b>. She was terribly cold, for <b>her clothes had worn threadbare and she herself was so slender and\nfrail. </b>Poor Thumbelina, she would freeze to death! Snow began to fall, and\nevery time a snowflake struck her it was as if she had been hit by a whole\nshovelful, for we are quite tall while she measured only an inch. <b>She wrapped a withered leaf about her,</b> <b>but there was no warmth in it.</b> <b>She shivered with cold.</b></i></p><p><i>Near\nthe edge of the woods where she now had arrived, was a large grain field, but\nthe grain had been harvested long ago. Only the <b>dry, bare stubble stuck out</b> of the frozen ground. <b>It was just as if she were lost in a vast\nforest,</b> and oh how she shivered with cold! Then she came to the door of a\nfield mouse, who had a little hole amidst the stubble. There this mouse lived,\nwarm and cozy, with a whole store-room of grain, and a magnificent kitchen and\npantry. Poor Thumbelina stood at the door, just like a beggar child, and pled\nfor a little bit of barley, <b>because she\nhadn&rsquo;t had anything to eat for two days past</b>.</i> (H.C. Andersen, <i>Thumbelina</i>)<i></i></p><p>Not to draws too many straws here,\nbut the parallels with Daenerys are there: </p><p><b><i>Dany&rsquo;s clothes were hardly more\nthan rags, and offered little in the way of warmth.</i></b> (&hellip;) <i>Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and Dany had torn a strip off\nthe hem to make a bandage for her shin. <b>I\nmust look a ragged thing, and starved</b>, she thought, but if the days stay\nwarm, I will not freeze. </i>(&hellip;) <i>She was\nhungry too.</i> (&hellip;) <b><i>The grass was as tall as she was</i></b><i>. </i>(&hellip;) <i>Though she walked\nthrough a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer. Even here <b>autumn made its presence felt, and winter\nwould not be far behind. The grass was paler than she remembered, a wan and\nsickly green on the verge of going yellow. After that would come brown. The\ngrass was dying. </b></i>(&hellip;) <i>&ldquo;I need\na hat,&rdquo; she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had tried to make one for\nherself, <b>weaving stalks of grass\ntogether</b> as she had seen Dothraki women do during her time with Drogo, but\neither she was using the wrong sort of grass or she simply lacked the necessary\nskill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. </i>(&hellip;) <b><i>&ldquo;I am lost at sea,&rdquo;</i></b><i> she said</i> (&hellip;) <i>Instead <b>she began to shiver</b> <b>violently</b>. </i>(&hellip;) <i>She scooped up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. </i>&ndash;\nDaenerys, ADWD</p><p>And both girls are rescued from\nthis environment by flying creatures. Little Thumbelina is small enough to\nmount a bird. Daenerys, a girl of &ldquo;regular&rdquo; size, mounts a dragon:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes,\nI will go with you!&rdquo; said Thumbelina. <b>She\nsat on his back, put her feet on his outstretched wings, and fastened her sash\nto one of his strongest feathers. Then the swallow soared into the air </b>over\nforests and over lakes, high up over the great mountains that are always capped\nwith snow. When Thumbelina felt cold in the chill air, she crept under the\nbird&rsquo;s warm feathers, with only her little head stuck out to watch all the\nwonderful sights below. </i>(H.C.\nAndersen, <i>Thumbelina</i>)</p><p><i>Dany\nleapt onto his back. She stank of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that\nmattered. &ldquo;To go forward I must go back,&rdquo; she said. Her bare legs tightened\naround the dragon&rsquo;s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the\nsky.</i> &ndash; Daenerys,\nADWD</p><p>Thumbelina flies to a country of\neternal spring, where she meets the fairy prince and gets her happily ever\nafter. The bird who carried her is sad nonetheless because she chose the fairy\nprince over him. </p><p>From what we know, Daenerys will\nsoon be flying to a country threatened by eternal winter, where she will meet a\nprince (Jon) who connects both with flowers (the &ldquo;blue flower from a chunk of\nice&rdquo;) and snow. </p><p>These are, so far, Arya&rsquo;s and\nDaenerys&rsquo;s journeys back home. <br /></p>",
