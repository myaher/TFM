Ice cream with potato chips crumbled on top was basically your go-to snack. It sounded odd, but it was absolutely <i>delicious </i>to you. The blend of salty and sweet was just right to satisfy your craving. Your husband, Ted, thought it was weird until he tried it one day. Since then, he preferred his ice cream with potato chips.</p><p>Your husband was locked away in the basement with his best friend and bandmate, Bill. Ted had the basement renovated into a sort of music studio so him and Bill could practice their music. It was soundproofed so it worked.</p><p>You grabbed the whip cream can and sprayed some of it onto your ice cream. You also sprayed some in your mouth for good measure. After you finished fixing your snack, you grabbed a spoon and dug into it. You moaned at how good it tasted.</p><p>\u201cThat hits the spot,\u201d you said after you swallowed the bite that you had taken.</p><p>You continued eating your concoction, happily. It had been an uneventful day thus far. You\u2019d been feeling sort of weird, but that was expected since you were nine months pregnant. You were actually several days over due. Baby Logan was supposed to make his appearance four days ago, but still nothing. You were ready for him to get out of you already. You were ready to meet him, yes, but you were also ready to feel like a normal person again. The weird cravings, the swollen ankles, and the back pain was growing old real fast. You were happy to be having a baby, but it was so hard.</p><p>You were just about to take another bite of the ice cream until you felt a weird pain in your stomach. You groaned as you looked down at your stomach. You\u2019d been feeling that same feeling off and on all day, but you\u2019d only suspected that it was Braxton Hicks. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time it happened.</p><p>\u201cChill out in there, little man,\u201d you said to your stomach as you rubbed it. \u201cMommy\u2019s trying to enjoy her snack. I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, there was another sharp pain that had you dropping the spoon in your hand as you bent over the counter. Okay, that one had been more intense than any of the others you had felt. You weren\u2019t sure what was going on until you felt a weird sensation then something running down your legs. Your eyes widened as you looked down, finding a puddle of water at your feet.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d you mumbled out. \u201cTed!\u201d</p><p>You facepalmed when you remembered he was in the basement, which was soundproofed. He wouldn\u2019t be able to hear you. You took a breath and carefully maneuvered yourself from the water, walking to the basement door as carefully as you could. You opened it and was suddenly blasted with the sound of loud guitars.</p><p>\u201cTed!\u201d You called out from above the stairs of the basement. You were worried about trying to walk down them. \u201cTHEODORE LOGAN!\u201d</p><p>The guitars suddenly stopped and you heard footsteps. You soon saw Ted at the foot of the stairs, his guitar still around him as he looked up at you.</p><p>\u201cDid you call for me, babe?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cTed, it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what?\u201d Ted asked with a confused look on his face. \u201cTime for dinner? It\u2019s only like 3:30.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s <i>fucking </i>time, Ted!\u201d You yelled out as another contraction hit you. \u201cAs in your son is coming! My water broke!\u201d</p><p>Ted\u2019s eyes widened, comically, as he pulled his guitar off of himself. He looked around himself for a few moments as if he were lost before he put it down finally.</p><p>\u201cBill, little dude is coming!\u201d Ted yelled out to his best friend.</p><p>\u201cNo way, dude!\u201d Bill exclaimed as he came into view.</p><p>\u201cYes way,\u201d Ted replied.</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d They both exclaimed and did their whole air guitar bit that was anything but amusing to you at the moment.</p><p>\u201cTheodore Logan, if you don\u2019t get up here and take me to the hospital<i> right now,</i> I\u2019m going to shove my foot so far up your-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d Ted said as he rushed up the stairs with Bill following him. \u201cShit&hellip;sorry, babe. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Ted was able to help you into a fresh pair of sweatpants as Bill ran upstairs to grab the hospital bag. You groaned as another contraction hit after Ted had you changed.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt, babe?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>\u201cNo, it feels <i>wonderful,\u201d </i>you told him, sarcastically.</p><p>Bill came back down with the bag and he followed the two of you out to the car. Ted helped you inside as Bill threw the bag in the backseat. He told Ted he would meet up with you both at the hospital. Ted jumped into the car and started it, but just sat there.</p><p>\u201cTed, what are you doing?\u201d You asked him as you looked over at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having a baby,\u201d Ted said, more to himself than to you. \u201cYou\u2019re having <i>my </i>baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s usually how it works, babe,\u201d you told him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a <i>baby,</i> Y/N,\u201d Ted said as he turned to look at you. \u201cAre you sure we\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>You gave him a look as your brow raised. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a little late to be changing our minds, Ted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just&hellip;what if I\u2019m not a good father for the little dude?\u201d Ted asked. \u201cWhat if I mess him up or something? I\u2019m not a very smart dude so what if he ends up dumb like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed, don\u2019t you dare say that about yourself,\u201d you said, feeling your heart break at his words. \u201cYou are going to be an amazing father! You\u2019re not going to mess him up and you most certainly are <i>not </i>dumb. You\u2019re the most excellent person I know.\u201d</p><p>Ted was looking at you and smiled as you spoke. He leaned over and kissed you before you pulled away from him, groaning in pain as another contraction hit you.</p><p>\u201cCan we please go to the hospital now?\u201d You asked as you did your breathing exercises.</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s meet the little dude already,\u201d he said as he finally started driving.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cTheodore Logan, you are never touching me again!\u201d You yelled out in pain as you were trying to push the baby out of you.</p><p>Ted was stood right beside you, holding your hand through the whole thing as he cheered you on. You felt like you\u2019d been pushing for hours and didn\u2019t think you had anymore energy left in you to continue. Also, the pain was intense and all you could do was squeeze Ted\u2019s hand for any sort of comfort. Granted, Ted was taking it like a champ even though he was sure his pinky was broken.</p><p>\u201cCome on, babe,\u201d Ted said before he swept your hair from your damp forehead and kissed it. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a most excellent job. I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Mrs. Logan,\u201d the doctor said from her spot. \u201cWe can see the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Ted took a glance for himself and his eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of his head while his face went pale. \u201cWoah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed, please don\u2019t pass out on me,\u201d you told him, noticing how weird he was looking. \u201cI really need you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, babe,\u201d Ted said after he took some deep breaths and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of your hand again and you went back to pushing. He encouraged you and praised you the whole time, which was really helpful. Ted knew exactly what he was doing.</p><p>Finally, a cry was heard sometime later and the doctor was announcing the arrival of your son. You and Ted were both in such awe. He cut the umbilical cord before they wrapped him and let you hold him. You had tears in your eyes as you held your tiny son and Ted had the biggest smile on his face. They soon took him to check him out and to clean him up as they finished up with you.</p><p>You and Ted were waiting in your room for some time before a nurse brought your son back to you. She handed him off to you and you looked down at him, able to see him better since he was cleaned up. He had a bit of hair that was dark and you smiled as you already noticed some of Ted\u2019s features on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, babe,\u201d Ted said as he looked at you both.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you too,\u201d you told him as you looked up at him. \u201cYou really helped me in there.\u201d</p><p>Ted smiled at you and then looked at the baby for a few minutes. \u201cWhat are we going to name him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should name him after you,\u201d you told him with a smile.</p><p>Ted looked at you, seeming a bit shocked. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you told him, \u201cbecause you\u2019re an amazing man and I think he would be proud to be named after you.\u201d</p><p>Ted smiled at that and leaned down to kiss you, softly. He then looked down at little Ted and kissed his head. You handed him to his father and he whined a bit before he settled down, cuddling into him. Ted looked like a complete natural. He also looked the happiest your ever seen him.</p><p>\u201cI think Bill\u2019s still out there and some of our family,\u201d Ted said. \u201cCan I go introduce little Ted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, babe,\u201d you told him and nodded.</p><p>Ted smiled and walked out of the room. You rested back against the bed and sighed in content. You were so happy and so lucky. You had a wonderful husband and now a wonderful baby boy.</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d You heard from outside and rolled your eyes as you giggled.</p>",

He looked around himself for a few moments as if he were lost before he put it down finally.</p><p>\u201cBill, little dude is coming!\u201d Ted yelled out to his best friend.</p><p>\u201cNo way, dude!\u201d Bill exclaimed as he came into view.</p><p>\u201cYes way,\u201d Ted replied.</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d They both exclaimed and did their whole air guitar bit that was anything but amusing to you at the moment.</p><p>\u201cTheodore Logan, if you don\u2019t get up here and take me to the hospital<i> right now,</i> I\u2019m going to shove my foot so far up your-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d Ted said as he rushed up the stairs with Bill following him. \u201cShit\u2026sorry, babe. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Ted was able to help you into a fresh pair of sweatpants as Bill ran upstairs to grab the hospital bag. You groaned as another contraction hit after Ted had you changed.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt, babe?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>\u201cNo, it feels <i>wonderful,\u201d </i>you told him, sarcastically.</p><p>Bill came back down with the bag and he followed the two of you out to the car. Ted helped you inside as Bill threw the bag in the backseat. He told Ted he would meet up with you both at the hospital. Ted jumped into the car and started it, but just sat there.</p><p>\u201cTed, what are you doing?\u201d You asked him as you looked over at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having a baby,\u201d Ted said, more to himself than to you. \u201cYou\u2019re having <i>my </i>baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s usually how it works, babe,\u201d you told him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a <i>baby,</i> Y/N,\u201d Ted said as he turned to look at you. \u201cAre you sure we\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>You gave him a look as your brow raised. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a little late to be changing our minds, Ted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026what if I\u2019m not a good father for the little dude?\u201d Ted asked. \u201cWhat if I mess him up or something? I\u2019m not a very smart dude so what if he ends up dumb like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed, don\u2019t you dare say that about yourself,\u201d you said, feeling your heart break at his words. \u201cYou are going to be an amazing father! You\u2019re not going to mess him up and you most certainly are <i>not </i>dumb. You\u2019re the most excellent person I know.\u201d</p><p>Ted was looking at you and smiled as you spoke. He leaned over and kissed you before you pulled away from him, groaning in pain as another contraction hit you.</p><p>\u201cCan we please go to the hospital now?\u201d You asked as you did your breathing exercises.</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s meet the little dude already,\u201d he said as he finally started driving.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cTheodore Logan, you are never touching me again!\u201d You yelled out in pain as you were trying to push the baby out of you.</p><p>Ted was stood right beside you, holding your hand through the whole thing as he cheered you on. You felt like you\u2019d been pushing for hours and didn\u2019t think you had anymore energy left in you to continue. Also, the pain was intense and all you could do was squeeze Ted\u2019s hand for any sort of comfort. Granted, Ted was taking it like a champ even though he was sure his pinky was broken.</p><p>\u201cCome on, babe,\u201d Ted said before he swept your hair from your damp forehead and kissed it. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a most excellent job. I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Mrs. Logan,\u201d the doctor said from her spot. \u201cWe can see the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Ted took a glance for himself and his eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of his head while his face went pale. \u201cWoah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed, please don\u2019t pass out on me,\u201d you told him, noticing how weird he was looking. \u201cI really need you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, babe,\u201d Ted said after he took some deep breaths and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of your hand again and you went back to pushing. He encouraged you and praised you the whole time, which was really helpful. Ted knew exactly what he was doing.</p><p>Finally, a cry was heard sometime later and the doctor was announcing the arrival of your son. You and Ted were both in such awe. He cut the umbilical cord before they wrapped him and let you hold him. You had tears in your eyes as you held your tiny son and Ted had the biggest smile on his face. They soon took him to check him out and to clean him up as they finished up with you.</p><p>You and Ted were waiting in your room for some time before a nurse brought your son back to you. She handed him off to you and you looked down at him, able to see him better since he was cleaned up. He had a bit of hair that was dark and you smiled as you already noticed some of Ted\u2019s features on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, babe,\u201d Ted said as he looked at you both.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you too,\u201d you told him as you looked up at him. \u201cYou really helped me in there.\u201d</p><p>Ted smiled at you and then looked at the baby for a few minutes. \u201cWhat are we going to name him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should name him after you,\u201d you told him with a smile.</p><p>Ted looked at you, seeming a bit shocked. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you told him, \u201cbecause you\u2019re an amazing man and I think he would be proud to be named after you.\u201d</p><p>Ted smiled at that and leaned down to kiss you, softly. He then looked down at little Ted and kissed his head. You handed him to his father and he whined a bit before he settled down, cuddling into him. Ted looked like a complete natural. He also looked the happiest your ever seen him.</p><p>\u201cI think Bill\u2019s still out there and some of our family,\u201d Ted said. \u201cCan I go introduce little Ted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, babe,\u201d you told him and nodded.</p><p>Ted smiled and walked out of the room. You rested back against the bed and sighed in content. You were so happy and so lucky. You had a wonderful husband and now a wonderful baby boy.</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d You heard from outside and rolled your eyes as you giggled.</p></p>",

Ice cream with potato chips crumbled on top was basically your go-to snack. It sounded odd, but it was absolutely <i>delicious </i>to you. The blend of salty and sweet was just right to satisfy your craving. Your husband, Ted, thought it was weird until he tried it one day. Since then, he preferred his ice cream with potato chips.</p><p>Your husband was locked away in the basement with his best friend and bandmate, Bill. Ted had the basement renovated into a sort of music studio so him and Bill could practice their music. It was soundproofed so it worked.</p><p>You grabbed the whip cream can and sprayed some of it onto your ice cream. You also sprayed some in your mouth for good measure. After you finished fixing your snack, you grabbed a spoon and dug into it. You moaned at how good it tasted.</p><p>\u201cThat hits the spot,\u201d you said after you swallowed the bite that you had taken.</p><p>You continued eating your concoction, happily. It had been an uneventful day thus far. You\u2019d been feeling sort of weird, but that was expected since you were nine months pregnant. You were actually several days over due. Baby Logan was supposed to make his appearance four days ago, but still nothing. You were ready for him to get out of you already. You were ready to meet him, yes, but you were also ready to feel like a normal person again. The weird cravings, the swollen ankles, and the back pain was growing old real fast. You were happy to be having a baby, but it was so hard.</p><p>You were just about to take another bite of the ice cream until you felt a weird pain in your stomach. You groaned as you looked down at your stomach. You\u2019d been feeling that same feeling off and on all day, but you\u2019d only suspected that it was Braxton Hicks. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time it happened.</p><p>\u201cChill out in there, little man,\u201d you said to your stomach as you rubbed it. \u201cMommy\u2019s trying to enjoy her snack. I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, there was another sharp pain that had you dropping the spoon in your hand as you bent over the counter. Okay, that one had been more intense than any of the others you had felt. You weren\u2019t sure what was going on until you felt a weird sensation then something running down your legs. Your eyes widened as you looked down, finding a puddle of water at your feet.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d you mumbled out. \u201cTed!\u201d</p><p>You facepalmed when you remembered he was in the basement, which was soundproofed. He wouldn\u2019t be able to hear you. You took a breath and carefully maneuvered yourself from the water, walking to the basement door as carefully as you could. You opened it and was suddenly blasted with the sound of loud guitars.</p><p>\u201cTed!\u201d You called out from above the stairs of the basement. You were worried about trying to walk down them. \u201cTHEODORE LOGAN!\u201d</p><p>The guitars suddenly stopped and you heard footsteps. You soon saw Ted at the foot of the stairs, his guitar still around him as he looked up at you.</p><p>\u201cDid you call for me, babe?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cTed, it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what?\u201d Ted asked with a confused look on his face. \u201cTime for dinner? It\u2019s only like 3:30.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s <i>fucking </i>time, Ted!\u201d You yelled out as another contraction hit you. \u201cAs in your son is coming!

He looked around himself for a few moments as if he were lost before he put it down finally.</p><p>&ldquo;Bill, little dude is coming!&rdquo; Ted yelled out to his best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;No way, dude!&rdquo; Bill exclaimed as he came into view.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes way,&rdquo; Ted replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; They both exclaimed and did their whole air guitar bit that was anything but amusing to you at the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Theodore Logan, if you don&rsquo;t get up here and take me to the hospital<i> right now,</i> I&rsquo;m going to shove my foot so far up your-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh right!&rdquo; Ted said as he rushed up the stairs with Bill following him. &ldquo;Shit&hellip;sorry, babe. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>Ted was able to help you into a fresh pair of sweatpants as Bill ran upstairs to grab the hospital bag. You groaned as another contraction hit after Ted had you changed.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it hurt, babe?&rdquo; He asked you.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it feels <i>wonderful,&rdquo; </i>you told him, sarcastically.</p><p>Bill came back down with the bag and he followed the two of you out to the car. Ted helped you inside as Bill threw the bag in the backseat. He told Ted he would meet up with you both at the hospital. Ted jumped into the car and started it, but just sat there.</p><p>&ldquo;Ted, what are you doing?&rdquo; You asked him as you looked over at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re having a baby,&rdquo; Ted said, more to himself than to you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re having <i>my </i>baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s usually how it works, babe,&rdquo; you told him.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a <i>baby,</i> Y/N,&rdquo; Ted said as he turned to look at you. &ldquo;Are you sure we&rsquo;re ready for this?&rdquo;</p><p>You gave him a look as your brow raised. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a little late to be changing our minds, Ted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;what if I&rsquo;m not a good father for the little dude?&rdquo; Ted asked. &ldquo;What if I mess him up or something? I&rsquo;m not a very smart dude so what if he ends up dumb like me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ted, don&rsquo;t you dare say that about yourself,&rdquo; you said, feeling your heart break at his words. &ldquo;You are going to be an amazing father! You&rsquo;re not going to mess him up and you most certainly are <i>not </i>dumb. You&rsquo;re the most excellent person I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Ted was looking at you and smiled as you spoke. He leaned over and kissed you before you pulled away from him, groaning in pain as another contraction hit you.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we please go to the hospital now?&rdquo; You asked as you did your breathing exercises.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s meet the little dude already,&rdquo; he said as he finally started driving.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Theodore Logan, you are never touching me again!&rdquo; You yelled out in pain as you were trying to push the baby out of you.</p><p>Ted was stood right beside you, holding your hand through the whole thing as he cheered you on. You felt like you&rsquo;d been pushing for hours and didn&rsquo;t think you had anymore energy left in you to continue. Also, the pain was intense and all you could do was squeeze Ted&rsquo;s hand for any sort of comfort. Granted, Ted was taking it like a champ even though he was sure his pinky was broken.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, babe,&rdquo; Ted said before he swept your hair from your damp forehead and kissed it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a most excellent job. I&rsquo;m so proud of you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing great, Mrs. Logan,&rdquo; the doctor said from her spot. &ldquo;We can see the head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; Ted took a glance for himself and his eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of his head while his face went pale. &ldquo;Woah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ted, please don&rsquo;t pass out on me,&rdquo; you told him, noticing how weird he was looking. &ldquo;I really need you right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, babe,&rdquo; Ted said after he took some deep breaths and shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p><p>He took hold of your hand again and you went back to pushing. He encouraged you and praised you the whole time, which was really helpful. Ted knew exactly what he was doing.</p><p>Finally, a cry was heard sometime later and the doctor was announcing the arrival of your son. You and Ted were both in such awe. He cut the umbilical cord before they wrapped him and let you hold him. You had tears in your eyes as you held your tiny son and Ted had the biggest smile on his face. They soon took him to check him out and to clean him up as they finished up with you.</p><p>You and Ted were waiting in your room for some time before a nurse brought your son back to you. She handed him off to you and you looked down at him, able to see him better since he was cleaned up. He had a bit of hair that was dark and you smiled as you already noticed some of Ted&rsquo;s features on him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you, babe,&rdquo; Ted said as he looked at you both.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you too,&rdquo; you told him as you looked up at him. &ldquo;You really helped me in there.&rdquo;</p><p>Ted smiled at you and then looked at the baby for a few minutes. &ldquo;What are we going to name him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We should name him after you,&rdquo; you told him with a smile.</p><p>Ted looked at you, seeming a bit shocked. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you told him, &ldquo;because you&rsquo;re an amazing man and I think he would be proud to be named after you.&rdquo;</p><p>Ted smiled at that and leaned down to kiss you, softly. He then looked down at little Ted and kissed his head. You handed him to his father and he whined a bit before he settled down, cuddling into him. Ted looked like a complete natural. He also looked the happiest your ever seen him.</p><p>&ldquo;I think Bill&rsquo;s still out there and some of our family,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;Can I go introduce little Ted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, babe,&rdquo; you told him and nodded.</p><p>Ted smiled and walked out of the room. You rested back against the bed and sighed in content. You were so happy and so lucky. You had a wonderful husband and now a wonderful baby boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; You heard from outside and rolled your eyes as you giggled.</p></p>",
