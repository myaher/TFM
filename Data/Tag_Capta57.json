        "body": "<p>To Brie Larson: Thank you for embodying Captain Marvel. Thank you for never flinching in the face of the wave of misogyny thrown your way. Thank you for lifting the dreams of girls and women everywhere and still speaking out in the defense of others. Your presence on screen was nothing short of breathtaking and I\u2019m so thankful to you for just being amazing. I can\u2019t wait to see more.</p><p>To Zoe Saldana: Thank you for just being amazing. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it is to put on all that makeup for Gamora, but I can say the MCU would be so much weaker without you. Your ability to give such a deadly character believably soft moments is a wonder to behold, and it has contributed heavily to the likability of the Guardians. So thank you for putting up with all the dressing because you have created a character that truly stands out from the MCU and from Cinema.\u00a0</p><p>To Karen Gillan: The role of a villianess who gets redeemed is a rare one, and you were so perfect for it. You took Nebula from a one off Villain to a fully fledged character that played such an important role in Endgame I was genuinely surprised. I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it so much had you not played her so well. You do Villain well, you do Hero well. You\u2019re funny and scary when necessary. Thank you for making me care about a character I never thought I would.</p><p>To Pom Klementieff: Thank you for surprising me about a character. Mantis is not a character I thought would be in it for the long haul, but I am glad I was wrong. Your acting in Infinity War was amazing and you really showed how powerful an empath Mantis truly is. And your comedy is spot on. I know Asian representation is still lacking, but I\u2019m glad you were able to break that barrier. You are a gem and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing more.\u00a0</p><p>To Tessa Thompson: Holy cow do I love your character. The amount of badass that radiates off you should be harnessed and used to power cities. Your fighting, your wit, your smile and laugh, everything is just a spectacular sight to behold. You really showed off what a female leader looks like, and I\u2019m glad Endgame acknowledged that fact and put you in your proper rank.\u00a0</p><p>To Evangeline Lilly: I\u2019m so glad you got a second movie to really show what you are capable of. I\u2019m glad you took the trope of\u00a0\u201cperfectly capable female gets sidelined by chosen male\u201d and smashed it to bits.You made that movie so worth it, retroactively making the first Ant Man look better.\u00a0 I was so happy to see you back in Endgame. Thank you for carrying the title of first female in the title, I know your achievement got a little overshadowed by Captain Marvel, but it was an important breakthrough and you handled it like it was nothing. Well done, and thank you.</p><p>To Letitia Wright: Your role as Shuri is just so special. To see a young girl, especially a black girl, be the smartest in the room, no, the smartest on the planet, is such a breath of fresh air. You breathed such life into the character, giving her the ability to be smart, funny, and a badass fighter. Shuri\u2019s strength comes from you and it is no small thing to say Black Panther just wouldn\u2019t have worked as well without you. Thank you.</p><p>To Lupita Nyong\u2019o: Little sad you weren\u2019t in Infinity war or Endgame, not going to lie. Your role in Black Panther though was amazing though. It\u2019s amazing how you showed the power of empathy and really drove home the message that if you are capable of helping, you should help. You always bring such a wonderful spark to all your characters and Nakia was no different. I hope you return in Black Panther 2.</p><p>To Danai Gurira: Damn I can\u2019t even express how much I love Okoye. You were the perfect choice to play a leader of an entirely female fighting force. You showed off strength and duty without being cold. Your fighting scenes were all amazingly fun to watch. I think you might be the only actress to have a prominent scene where you are licked by a rhino followed by threatening to kill your traitor husband and my god did you make it all so iconic. Your character would not have been so easily beloved without you. Thank you.\u00a0</p><p>To Gwyneth Paltrow: You had one of the toughest roles in the MCU. You were acting across from RDJ and you not only held your own, you established yourself as a staple character. You were every bit as critical to Tony\u2019s journey as RDJ was. You were given a stereotypical side character love interest role and made her so special. I\u2019m glad your strength was recognized in both Iron Man 3 and Endgame because you more than deserve it. Also, your delivery of your final lines to Tony were heart-smashingly perfect. Thank you for giving us your performance.</p><p>To Angela Basset, Rene Russo, and Michelle Pfeiffer: The role of mother is a critical one and all of you were spectacular. You give heart to otherwise cold atmospheres, breathing life into stories like no other. You give love to characters who need it most. You bring a sense of home to a world of fantasy so different from our own. Thank you.\u00a0</p><p>To Natalie Portman and Emily VanCamp: Thank you for your roles. If was unfair your characters were written into the sidelines as love interests, despite both your characters having incredible strength. Your talents are priceless and your contributions will not be forgotten.\u00a0</p><p>And To Scarlet Johannson: Look, I really want you to make better acting choices. I hope you take the feedback given to you and be better in your career moving forward. But I can\u2019t deny your achievements in the MCU. You were the first women in the super hero line up. You carried that title for all the first phase and most of the second phase. You were given a stereotype and you killed it. Your character was written wildly different from movie to movie and yet you still managed to make it as seamless as possible. You were witty, funny, heartfelt, and goddamn your death scene was heart wrenching. You paved the way for the others. You held strong, acting against RDJ and Chris Evens in their own movies, and it never felt like you were second fiddle. You achieved so much with being given so little to work with. Your presence and performance were gifts to behold, so from the bottom of my heart, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And to every other women who has contributed to the MCU, both big and small, both on and off screen, your roles are so important to female fans everywhere. Thank you, truly, for helping bring these characters to life and give people everywhere a model to see just how strong women can be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not alone.\u201d<br/></p>",
