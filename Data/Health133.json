Basking in\u00a0nature provides us many health benefits for our mind and body. Studies have shown that constant exposure green areas relaxes the body, reduces stress and can aid in alleviating anxiety.

It can\u00a0be a great way to keep in touch with friends, provide\u00a0opportunities\u00a0to meet new people and\u00a0help connect a community. Since golf is a game of that is not as highly intense or competitive as soccer or basketball, there is plenty of down time and silence for interacting with fellow golfers.

Those frequent visits to your friendly course beer-cart girl can give your bladder a run for time. The longer you learn to hold it, the more you strengthen the capacity of your bladder. And, as noted by some women golfers, it\u2019s also an effective way to strengthen leg muscles, especially in the quadriceps.

Skipping out on the golf cart and walking the average course can cover a distance between five to seven kilometers. If you opt to carry your own clubs, you\u2019ll burn even more calories, too! With all the walking, carrying and swinging involved, golfers can burn up to 1000 calories in a single game.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Keeps your heart rate up \u2013\u00a0</strong>Playing golf can lead to quite a bit of exercise for your heart.

I need like a swig of whiskey before going in or something.\u00a0</p><p>Anyway.\u00a0</p><p>So as some of you may know, I was taking adderall for a while. I was having really bad brain fog, hard to motivate (but not depressed, just like someone having a radio on whitenoise in my head and painting my motivation gray); and it helped me in a few ways. It helped me zero in on any one activity without thinking about a thousand other things. That was the main thing. I loved being able to zero-in and focus on what I want to focus on. And it lessened my appetite which was a plus because I tend to eat when I\u2019m not really hungry.\u00a0</p><p>But: it also gave me annoying crashes. Not crashes I couldn\u2019t live with, but crashes that I don\u2019t want. I would feel slightly paranoid about people\u2019s intentions (like I am normally but with the volume turned up a little more so it\u2019s harder for me to ignore like normal). And I felt like my memory was going to shtako.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t remember when I stopped taking adderall, but I remember that I was starting to take 3000 or 4000 iu of vitamin D around the same time. I\u2019m not saying Vitamin D was all I needed, but I am just logging what I remember. Correlation is not causation.\u00a0</p><p>Mental health/illness&hellip;. terms we hear about on a daily basis now. Talking about your own brain is like putting a mirror in front of a mirror and trying to figure out how far it goes&hellip;.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve seen a lot of\u00a0\u201cWhat ADHD is really like\u201d posts on here&hellip;. and it honestly makes me sad. Not because people experience those things, but because a label is being put on things that I\u2019ve never seen a person NOT do.\u00a0</p><p>Like stopping a project to start another one. Sometmes never going back to the other one. Or going back in X amount of time.\u00a0\n\nOr like&hellip; forgetting what you were doing or saying? Not being able to focus on something for very long or getting distracted easily?\u00a0 \u00a0 I don\u2019t know anyone who is able to master those things. Like&hellip; those may not be <i>ideal? </i>But to give a name that is often treated with drugs???\u00a0</p><p>I was glad to have learned the hard way that medication isn\u2019t always the answer, because I wouldn\u2019t have learned by someone telling me, honestly.\u00a0</p><p>Sometimes it is - I\u2019ve learned this too in my little journey. I felt the shame of saying that I take adderall&hellip;. but I also finally felt that it\u2019s <i>okay </i>to be on medication. And the only reason I\u2019m not, honestly, is the side-effects.

        "body": "I had low expectations for sleep after Ryder was born. L-O-W. Chase was never a good sleeper and, couple that with the fact that his small 5 pound 10 ounce size had us following doctor\u2019s orders and setting alarms to wake him up every 2 hours to feed all throughout the day and night, sleep was pretty horrible for months and months after Chase was born.\n<p>We had little glimmers of hope here and there with a few weeks of good sleep peppered in but eventually I just threw in the towel and embraced the fact that Chase was going to be up in the night. I truly wouldn\u2019t say he officially slept through the night consistently until we weaned and I stopped nursing him at 15 months.</p>\n<p>For those who might be in a similar boat with a child over one year old, there IS hope! Chase is a great sleeper now and rarely wakes in the night. So everything I read about how important it is to establish consistent, long stretches of uninterrupted sleep for infants now makes me think \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s probably fabulous and admittedly preferred, but if it\u2019s not working for you or your baby, it will be okay. Your child won\u2019t be ruined forever.</p>\n<p>With Ryder, things instantly felt different. He was bigger at birth \u2014 7 pounds, 7 ounces \u2014 and in general just seemed to be a better sleeper and a more laid back baby. Almost immediately, we had longer stretches of sleep and I\u2019d find myself awake in the night starring at him shocked that he wasn\u2019t awake because I was anticipating consistent nighttime feeds for months on end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84705\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-854x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-854x1024.jpg 854w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-250x300.jpg 250w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-768x921.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\"/></a></p>\n<p>By the time he was 2-3 months old, Ryder was often waking only one time in the night to nurse and I was thanking my lucky stars for a \u201cgood sleeper.\u201d I thought we lucked out and would coast through dropping his one remaining nighttime feed when the time was right.</p>\n<p>And then the four month sleep regression hit. And it hit us HARD.</p>\n<p>Seemingly overnight, Ryder was up at least three, often four, times a night. At first I thought it was just a fluke but then weeks passed by and I was still feeding him on demand and nursing him every 2-3 hours at night. It was BRUTAL and after two months of this, something needed to change. My mom instincts told me he was more than capable of longer stretches of sleep because we\u2019d seen him do it before. He was growing and gaining weight but his new middle-of-the-night snacks meant that his daytime feeds were becoming more much shorter and snack-like, too. I felt like for both his sake and my sanity, we needed to work to getting him back to longer stretches of sleep.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Gentle Cry-It-Out Method</strong></h4>\n<p>This time, unlike with Chase, I didn\u2019t read a bazillion sleep books that made me feel horrible about my baby. I had a general idea of what I wanted to do with Ryder when it came to sleep training. I didn\u2019t fear letting him cry in his crib a bit but I also didn\u2019t want to let him wail in his crib for hours on end. Then, during a media visit to Great Wolf Lodge, I met Lexi from the blog <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glitter, Inc</a>. She was so bubbly and friendly and I found myself spending a little too much time on her blog after we met because it was gorgeous and her upbeat personality was evident in her posts. And that\u2019s when I stumbled upon her post about the <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gentle Cry-It-Out Method</a>. It was a method she learned about after a phone call consultation with her husband\u2019s friend \u2014 a neurologist who specializes in pediatric sleep \u2014 and it sounded PERFECT!</p>\n<p>A quick note: In Lexi\u2019s blog post about the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method, she mentions implementing a sleep schedule during the day and <em>then</em> focuses on eliminating nighttime wake-ups. I really only followed the part about eliminating nighttime wake-ups because creating a sleep schedule for Ryder during the day is just a little complicated with Chase in the mix. I hope to establish some kind of a pattern when it comes to Ryder\u2019s daytime naps but right now he\u2019s a pretty good on-the-go napper and I don\u2019t want to mess with that!</p>\n<p>Also, if the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method interests you, PLEASE read <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lexi\u2019s post</a>. It\u2019s incredibly thorough and I\u2019m only sharing a rough highlight of how we used it in our house in a way that worked for us. Lexi\u2019s post has a lot more information so just consider this my super-short summary of what worked for our 6-month-old and how we applied aspects of the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method to our sleep training experience.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a brief overview of the way we implemented the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method to eliminate nighttime wake-ups with Ryder:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Watch for signs of sleepiness.</strong> These are very, very obvious with Ryder. Since he\u2019s generally not a fussy baby, when he gets fussy, he\u2019s usually either hungry or sleepy. At the end of the day, it\u2019s both\u2026 and it\u2019s time for bed!</li>\n<li><strong>Eliminate all distractions.\u00a0</strong>This means heading up to Ryder\u2019s nursery for a diaper change with the blinds pulled and lights low. I change and nurse Ryder with only the soft glow of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SGY27N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">salt lamp</a>\u00a0in his nursery.</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83711\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-1024x733.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"539\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-768x550.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>(Note: The blanket you see hanging off the crib was just there for decor purposes when I took pics of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/ryders-nursery-tour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ryder\u2019s nursery</a> before he was born. He sleeps in a crib free of anything other than his Wubbanubs.)\u00a0</em></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Put Ryder in his sleep suit.</strong>\u00a0The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VFmDM7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Magic Merlin Sleepsuit</a> is a lifesaver and it seems to instantly calm Ryder down. I worried it wasn\u2019t going to work for Ryder (it was <em>crucial</em> for sleep for Chase!) but I think that when I initially tried putting Ryder in it, he was a little too young. I waited a month and then tried again and it worked like a charm for transitioning out of the swaddle and calming Ryder before and during sleep. (Note: The sleepsuit is not specifically part of the GCIO method but it is critical for us so I had to include it! They mention swaddling or whatever works for your baby\u2019s sleep.)</li>\n<li><strong>Turn on white noise machine.</strong> This is another big-time MUST for Ryder\u2019s sleep. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RDEUKL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">white noise machine</a> seems to help him relax and, as a bonus, it covers up random household noises that might wake him up in the night (Sadie barking, the heat coming on, etc.).</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84712\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-1024x795.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"581\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-1024x795.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-768x596.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\"/></a></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Nurse Ryder and put him in his crib drowsy but not fully asleep.</strong>\u00a0Thankfully this wasn\u2019t a big change for us, as I\u2019ve been doing this since Ryder was a teeny baby.

The first few nights, they will, in all likelihood, cry for a full 5 minutes. Let baby cry for a full five minutes. (It will seem\u00a0<em>much</em>\u00a0longer, but remember, it\u2019s just 5 minutes.)</li>\n<li>When your phone alarm alerts you that 5 minutes have passed, quietly go into the room, put your hand on baby\u2019s chest, and in a soft soothing voice comfort them. If they use a pacifier, give it to them, and then quietly walk out of the room again.</li>\n<li>Set your alarm for another 5 minutes. When the alarm sounds, and if baby is still crying, go in again and repeat the above. At no point should you pick up the baby, feed the baby, etc. I KNOW it\u2019s hard. The first few nights, I myself stand outside our baby\u2019s door and tear up myself. It\u2019s brutal, and I hate it. But do you know what happens after that second 5-minute interval? Baby falls asleep. Sometimes it takes a third visit. At that point, set your alarm for 10 minutes, and ONLY go in after 10 minutes if baby is still crying.</li>\n<li>Repeat this process for as long as baby cries, extending the time you leave baby alone by about five minutes each time until he or she falls asleep. Repeat the same exact process on the second night, and again on the third.</li>\n</ul><p>Our sleep training coincided with transferring Ryder into his crib for the first time. I am not sure whether this is ideal or not, but I wanted to establish Ryder\u2019s crib as a place for sleep and \u2014 hopefully \u2014 GOOD sleep from day one. We followed all of the above bullet points as we attempted both the crib transfer and sleep training at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84710\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"588\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a five-day timeline of what the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method looked like for us:</p>\n<h4>NIGHT ONE</h4>\n<p>As I anticipated, this was our roughest night by far. I nursed Ryder and put him in his crib drowsy but not asleep. I\u2019ve been doing this from day one with Ryder, so I wasn\u2019t anticipating too much fussiness as he drifted off to sleep. He fell asleep fairly easily but, like clockwork, he woke up crying at 10 p.m. for what would\u2019ve been his first feed of the night. As noted in the Gentle Cry-It-Out method, I let him cry for 5 minutes before going into his room giving him his pacifier, placing my hand on his chest and quietly walking out of his room.</p>\n<p>I feel fortunate that Ryder seems to be an \u201cintermittent crier.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a thing or not but he never really seems to wail and wail non-stop. He\u2019ll often cry but his cries almost always hit a peak and then taper off which makes it a little easier on my mama heart when it comes to staying out of his room when he begins to cry. (Basically when his cries taper off, I am given a little glimmer of hope that they might stop altogether!)</p>\n<p>On night one, Ryder woke up at 10 p.m. and needed his pacifier replaced twice before falling back asleep. (I followed the five minute timeline each time before replacing his pacifier.) Ryder woke up again around midnight and that\u2019s when the fun began. We spent the next two hours playing paci-pong, setting timers and going back into his room to replace his pacifier in 5, 10, 15 and 20-minute intervals. I never stayed out of his room for more than 20 minutes but didn\u2019t really need to because eventually he fell asleep. It was almost like he was crying then resting then crying briefly again before sleeping. (Again, he seems to be an \u201cintermittent crier\u201d and never really wails and wails.) Ryder was never crying for long stretches during any of the paci-pong stage but I was awake the whole time and it was pretty hands-on as I set timers and replaced his pacifier at the designated intervals.</p>\n<p>After finally falling into a deeper sleep at 2 a.m., Ryder was up again at 4 a.m. for another two rounds of paci-pong and I went in to replace his pacifier twice after five minutes.\u00a0This happened again at 5:30 a.m. And then he was eventually up for the day.</p>\n<p>In the morning, I walked into Ryder\u2019s room to find a smiling, happy baby which was wonderful. (He wasn\u2019t even crying for me to come in\u2026 just peacefully playing with his Wubbanub!) Ryder ate like a champ in the morning which was also fantastic since his morning feeds were becoming really short and snack-like prior to sleep training thanks to his middle-of-the-night snack sessions.My breasts were hard as rocks and felt like they were going to explode and I\u2019m pretty sure I was more pumped for our morning nursing session than Ryder!</p>\n<p>So, in summary, our first night was a rough night for sure but I felt like I saw small progress after the long round of paci-pong at midnight when he seemed to take his paci and go back to sleep much faster at his 4 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. wake ups. I already believed we were on our way to better sleep!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT TWO</h4>\n<p>Night two marked a little bit of progress but began on a rough note. Ryder made it until 11 p.m. before crying \u2014 one hour later than the previous night \u2014 but spent the next 90 minutes crying on and off as I set timers and went in and out of his room replacing his pacifier at the designated timed intervals. He woke up again around 4 a.m. and I replaced his paci twice but then he didn\u2019t wake up until 7 a.m. when he was ready for his morning feed. Since he already missed one of his usual wake up times, this felt like MAJOR progress and I began to really trust that the Gently Cry-It-Out Method of timed intervals would work for us. I was honestly shocked night two went as well as it did after a pretty intense first night.</p>\n<h4>NIGHT THREE</h4>\n<p>Night three looked a lot like night two but the crying time decreased <em>dramatically</em> which felt like another major victory! Ryder was up twice but both times I only needed to replace his pacifier one time before he fell asleep. HUGE progress!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT FOUR</h4>\n<p>Night four Ryder woke up a few times and each time he fussed a little bit but fairly quickly found his pacifier and put it back in his mouth himself and went back to sleep almost immediately. On night four, I never had to go into his room and I was pretty darn psyched after this night!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT FIVE</h4>\n<p>Night five was a great one. It looked like night four but with even less wake-ups for Ryder. This is the night that I truly felt like I could say Ryder officially \u201cslept through the night\u201d which felt incredible.</p>\n<h4>What Nighttime Sleep Currently Looks Like Over Here: One Month Later</h4>\n<p>We\u2019re just under one month into our sleep training experience and I figured a little update about how sleep currently looks might be of interest. Once we implemented the Gentle Cry-It-Out method for nighttime sleep, we seemed to coast through nighttime sleep for a couple of weeks. I was convinced everything would be derailed when we traveled to Florida for Christmas, but Ryder shocked us by sleeping through the night every single night. It was incredible and I was so thankful! And yes, I packed all of his baby sleep essentials \u2014 noise machine, sleep suit and FIVE <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CaHmyv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wubbanubs</a>! I wasn\u2019t taking any chances!</p>\n<p>Since then, we\u2019ve had a few rough nights but, for the most part, nighttime sleep is going much, much better. Ryder seems to be able to self-soothe with the help of his pacifier almost every night buuut there have been a few nights where I\u2019ve gone in to nurse Ryder and have picked him up to soothe him because something seemed off. The one major hiccup we\u2019ve had with nighttime sleep occurred last week and seemed to coincide with Ryder\u2019s first tooth coming in.</p>\n<p>There have also been two instances where I\u2019ve felt like we had to almost re-train Ryder to sleep and both of these happened the night after I had previously nursed him or picked him up the night before. Clearly he remembers!!! But, the good news is, it usually only takes one semi-rough night for us to get back on track with decent sleep. Phew!</p>\n<h4>Why I Think This Method Was Successful For Us</h4>\n<p>I am not over here claiming Ryder\u2019s nighttime sleep will be permanently fantastic from here on out. I know enough by now to know that baby sleep ebbs and flows and can be a rollercoaster. (I was convinced we had Chase mostly \u201csleep trained\u201d at 6 months and then we had major regression. It is what it is.)</p>\n<p>I attribute most of the success we\u2019ve had with this method with Ryder\u2019s age. I knew I needed him to be old enough to replace his pacifier himself before we started sleep training because that\u2019s definitely his preferred method of self-soothing. Without his pacifier, I believe crying would\u2019ve lasted a lot longer and would have been a lot harder for me personally to handle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84709\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-1024x730.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"555\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-1024x730.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>(Side note: If you\u2019re looking for a baby monitor with multiple camera compatibility, we are loving our <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RJZuJD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infant Optics monitor</a>. When I asked for monitor recs on Instagram, the Infant Optics camera was by far the most recommended and we\u2019ve been really happy with it. The monitor cycles through the cameras in Chase\u2019s room and Ryder\u2019s room every 12 seconds and can work with up to four camera.)</em></p>\n<p>Also, I waited until Ryder was nearly six months old to start sleep training for another important reason: I wasn\u2019t personally ready to start sleep training until he was six months old. Could we have started sooner? Probably. I read all the time about kids who consistently sleep through the night much earlier but I wasn\u2019t ready to move Ryder into his crib let alone begin sleep training until he was nearly six months old. I know some people tackle baby sleep much sooner and some much later. Different methods and timelines work for different babies and that\u2019s awesome. Everything related to babies seems to vary so much kid to kid so knowing your child and knowing yourself is key!</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s my very long-winded way of catching you guys up on our latest sleep training experience!

Chase was never a good sleeper and, couple that with the fact that his small 5 pound 10 ounce size had us following doctor\u2019s orders and setting alarms to wake him up every 2 hours to feed all throughout the day and night, sleep was pretty horrible for months and months after Chase was born.\n<p>We had little glimmers of hope here and there with a few weeks of good sleep peppered in but eventually I just threw in the towel and embraced the fact that Chase was going to be up in the night. I truly wouldn\u2019t say he officially slept through the night consistently until we weaned and I stopped nursing him at 15 months.</p>\n<p>For those who might be in a similar boat with a child over one year old, there IS hope! Chase is a great sleeper now and rarely wakes in the night. So everything I read about how important it is to establish consistent, long stretches of uninterrupted sleep for infants now makes me think \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s probably fabulous and admittedly preferred, but if it\u2019s not working for you or your baby, it will be okay. Your child won\u2019t be ruined forever.</p>\n<p>With Ryder, things instantly felt different. He was bigger at birth \u2014 7 pounds, 7 ounces \u2014 and in general just seemed to be a better sleeper and a more laid back baby. Almost immediately, we had longer stretches of sleep and I\u2019d find myself awake in the night starring at him shocked that he wasn\u2019t awake because I was anticipating consistent nighttime feeds for months on end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84705\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-854x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-854x1024.jpg 854w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-250x300.jpg 250w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-768x921.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\"></a></p>\n<p>By the time he was 2-3 months old, Ryder was often waking only one time in the night to nurse and I was thanking my lucky stars for a \u201cgood sleeper.\u201d I thought we lucked out and would coast through dropping his one remaining nighttime feed when the time was right.</p>\n<p>And then the four month sleep regression hit. And it hit us HARD.</p>\n<p>Seemingly overnight, Ryder was up at least three, often four, times a night. At first I thought it was just a fluke but then weeks passed by and I was still feeding him on demand and nursing him every 2-3 hours at night. It was BRUTAL and after two months of this, something needed to change. My mom instincts told me he was more than capable of longer stretches of sleep because we\u2019d seen him do it before. He was growing and gaining weight but his new middle-of-the-night snacks meant that his daytime feeds were becoming more much shorter and snack-like, too. I felt like for both his sake and my sanity, we needed to work to getting him back to longer stretches of sleep.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Gentle Cry-It-Out Method</strong></h4>\n<p>This time, unlike with Chase, I didn\u2019t read a bazillion sleep books that made me feel horrible about my baby. I had a general idea of what I wanted to do with Ryder when it came to sleep training. I didn\u2019t fear letting him cry in his crib a bit but I also didn\u2019t want to let him wail in his crib for hours on end. Then, during a media visit to Great Wolf Lodge, I met Lexi from the blog <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glitter, Inc</a>. She was so bubbly and friendly and I found myself spending a little too much time on her blog after we met because it was gorgeous and her upbeat personality was evident in her posts. And that\u2019s when I stumbled upon her post about the <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gentle Cry-It-Out Method</a>. It was a method she learned about after a phone call consultation with her husband\u2019s friend \u2014 a neurologist who specializes in pediatric sleep \u2014 and it sounded PERFECT!</p>\n<p>A quick note: In Lexi\u2019s blog post about the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method, she mentions implementing a sleep schedule during the day and <em>then</em> focuses on eliminating nighttime wake-ups. I really only followed the part about eliminating nighttime wake-ups because creating a sleep schedule for Ryder during the day is just a little complicated with Chase in the mix. I hope to establish some kind of a pattern when it comes to Ryder\u2019s daytime naps but right now he\u2019s a pretty good on-the-go napper and I don\u2019t want to mess with that!</p>\n<p>Also, if the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method interests you, PLEASE read <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lexi\u2019s post</a>. It\u2019s incredibly thorough and I\u2019m only sharing a rough highlight of how we used it in our house in a way that worked for us. Lexi\u2019s post has a lot more information so just consider this my super-short summary of what worked for our 6-month-old and how we applied aspects of the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method to our sleep training experience.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a brief overview of the way we implemented the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method to eliminate nighttime wake-ups with Ryder:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Watch for signs of sleepiness.</strong> These are very, very obvious with Ryder. Since he\u2019s generally not a fussy baby, when he gets fussy, he\u2019s usually either hungry or sleepy. At the end of the day, it\u2019s both\u2026 and it\u2019s time for bed!</li>\n<li><strong>Eliminate all distractions.\u00a0</strong>This means heading up to Ryder\u2019s nursery for a diaper change with the blinds pulled and lights low. I change and nurse Ryder with only the soft glow of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SGY27N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">salt lamp</a>\u00a0in his nursery.</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83711\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-1024x733.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"539\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-768x550.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px\"></a></p>\n<p><em>(Note: The blanket you see hanging off the crib was just there for decor purposes when I took pics of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/ryders-nursery-tour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ryder\u2019s nursery</a> before he was born. He sleeps in a crib free of anything other than his Wubbanubs.)\u00a0</em></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Put Ryder in his sleep suit.</strong>\u00a0The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VFmDM7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Magic Merlin Sleepsuit</a> is a lifesaver and it seems to instantly calm Ryder down. I worried it wasn\u2019t going to work for Ryder (it was <em>crucial</em> for sleep for Chase!) but I think that when I initially tried putting Ryder in it, he was a little too young. I waited a month and then tried again and it worked like a charm for transitioning out of the swaddle and calming Ryder before and during sleep. (Note: The sleepsuit is not specifically part of the GCIO method but it is critical for us so I had to include it! They mention swaddling or whatever works for your baby\u2019s sleep.)</li>\n<li><strong>Turn on white noise machine.</strong> This is another big-time MUST for Ryder\u2019s sleep. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RDEUKL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">white noise machine</a> seems to help him relax and, as a bonus, it covers up random household noises that might wake him up in the night (Sadie barking, the heat coming on, etc.).</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84712\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-1024x795.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"581\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-1024x795.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-768x596.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\"></a></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Nurse Ryder and put him in his crib drowsy but not fully asleep.</strong>\u00a0Thankfully this wasn\u2019t a big change for us, as I\u2019ve been doing this since Ryder was a teeny baby.

The first few nights, they will, in all likelihood, cry for a full 5 minutes. Let baby cry for a full five minutes. (It will seem\u00a0<em>much</em>\u00a0longer, but remember, it\u2019s just 5 minutes.)</li>\n<li>When your phone alarm alerts you that 5 minutes have passed, quietly go into the room, put your hand on baby\u2019s chest, and in a soft soothing voice comfort them. If they use a pacifier, give it to them, and then quietly walk out of the room again.</li>\n<li>Set your alarm for another 5 minutes. When the alarm sounds, and if baby is still crying, go in again and repeat the above. At no point should you pick up the baby, feed the baby, etc. I KNOW it\u2019s hard. The first few nights, I myself stand outside our baby\u2019s door and tear up myself. It\u2019s brutal, and I hate it. But do you know what happens after that second 5-minute interval? Baby falls asleep. Sometimes it takes a third visit. At that point, set your alarm for 10 minutes, and ONLY go in after 10 minutes if baby is still crying.</li>\n<li>Repeat this process for as long as baby cries, extending the time you leave baby alone by about five minutes each time until he or she falls asleep. Repeat the same exact process on the second night, and again on the third.</li>\n</ul><p>Our sleep training coincided with transferring Ryder into his crib for the first time. I am not sure whether this is ideal or not, but I wanted to establish Ryder\u2019s crib as a place for sleep and \u2014 hopefully \u2014 GOOD sleep from day one. We followed all of the above bullet points as we attempted both the crib transfer and sleep training at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84710\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"588\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\"></a></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a five-day timeline of what the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method looked like for us:</p>\n<h4>NIGHT ONE</h4>\n<p>As I anticipated, this was our roughest night by far. I nursed Ryder and put him in his crib drowsy but not asleep. I\u2019ve been doing this from day one with Ryder, so I wasn\u2019t anticipating too much fussiness as he drifted off to sleep. He fell asleep fairly easily but, like clockwork, he woke up crying at 10 p.m. for what would\u2019ve been his first feed of the night. As noted in the Gentle Cry-It-Out method, I let him cry for 5 minutes before going into his room giving him his pacifier, placing my hand on his chest and quietly walking out of his room.</p>\n<p>I feel fortunate that Ryder seems to be an \u201cintermittent crier.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a thing or not but he never really seems to wail and wail non-stop. He\u2019ll often cry but his cries almost always hit a peak and then taper off which makes it a little easier on my mama heart when it comes to staying out of his room when he begins to cry. (Basically when his cries taper off, I am given a little glimmer of hope that they might stop altogether!)</p>\n<p>On night one, Ryder woke up at 10 p.m. and needed his pacifier replaced twice before falling back asleep. (I followed the five minute timeline each time before replacing his pacifier.) Ryder woke up again around midnight and that\u2019s when the fun began. We spent the next two hours playing paci-pong, setting timers and going back into his room to replace his pacifier in 5, 10, 15 and 20-minute intervals. I never stayed out of his room for more than 20 minutes but didn\u2019t really need to because eventually he fell asleep. It was almost like he was crying then resting then crying briefly again before sleeping. (Again, he seems to be an \u201cintermittent crier\u201d and never really wails and wails.) Ryder was never crying for long stretches during any of the paci-pong stage but I was awake the whole time and it was pretty hands-on as I set timers and replaced his pacifier at the designated intervals.</p>\n<p>After finally falling into a deeper sleep at 2 a.m., Ryder was up again at 4 a.m. for another two rounds of paci-pong and I went in to replace his pacifier twice after five minutes.\u00a0This happened again at 5:30 a.m. And then he was eventually up for the day.</p>\n<p>In the morning, I walked into Ryder\u2019s room to find a smiling, happy baby which was wonderful. (He wasn\u2019t even crying for me to come in\u2026 just peacefully playing with his Wubbanub!) Ryder ate like a champ in the morning which was also fantastic since his morning feeds were becoming really short and snack-like prior to sleep training thanks to his middle-of-the-night snack sessions.My breasts were hard as rocks and felt like they were going to explode and I\u2019m pretty sure I was more pumped for our morning nursing session than Ryder!</p>\n<p>So, in summary, our first night was a rough night for sure but I felt like I saw small progress after the long round of paci-pong at midnight when he seemed to take his paci and go back to sleep much faster at his 4 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. wake ups. I already believed we were on our way to better sleep!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT TWO</h4>\n<p>Night two marked a little bit of progress but began on a rough note. Ryder made it until 11 p.m. before crying \u2014 one hour later than the previous night \u2014 but spent the next 90 minutes crying on and off as I set timers and went in and out of his room replacing his pacifier at the designated timed intervals. He woke up again around 4 a.m. and I replaced his paci twice but then he didn\u2019t wake up until 7 a.m. when he was ready for his morning feed. Since he already missed one of his usual wake up times, this felt like MAJOR progress and I began to really trust that the Gently Cry-It-Out Method of timed intervals would work for us. I was honestly shocked night two went as well as it did after a pretty intense first night.</p>\n<h4>NIGHT THREE</h4>\n<p>Night three looked a lot like night two but the crying time decreased <em>dramatically</em> which felt like another major victory! Ryder was up twice but both times I only needed to replace his pacifier one time before he fell asleep. HUGE progress!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT FOUR</h4>\n<p>Night four Ryder woke up a few times and each time he fussed a little bit but fairly quickly found his pacifier and put it back in his mouth himself and went back to sleep almost immediately. On night four, I never had to go into his room and I was pretty darn psyched after this night!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT FIVE</h4>\n<p>Night five was a great one. It looked like night four but with even less wake-ups for Ryder. This is the night that I truly felt like I could say Ryder officially \u201cslept through the night\u201d which felt incredible.</p>\n<h4>What Nighttime Sleep Currently Looks Like Over Here: One Month Later</h4>\n<p>We\u2019re just under one month into our sleep training experience and I figured a little update about how sleep currently looks might be of interest. Once we implemented the Gentle Cry-It-Out method for nighttime sleep, we seemed to coast through nighttime sleep for a couple of weeks. I was convinced everything would be derailed when we traveled to Florida for Christmas, but Ryder shocked us by sleeping through the night every single night. It was incredible and I was so thankful! And yes, I packed all of his baby sleep essentials \u2014 noise machine, sleep suit and FIVE <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CaHmyv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wubbanubs</a>! I wasn\u2019t taking any chances!</p>\n<p>Since then, we\u2019ve had a few rough nights but, for the most part, nighttime sleep is going much, much better. Ryder seems to be able to self-soothe with the help of his pacifier almost every night buuut there have been a few nights where I\u2019ve gone in to nurse Ryder and have picked him up to soothe him because something seemed off. The one major hiccup we\u2019ve had with nighttime sleep occurred last week and seemed to coincide with Ryder\u2019s first tooth coming in.</p>\n<p>There have also been two instances where I\u2019ve felt like we had to almost re-train Ryder to sleep and both of these happened the night after I had previously nursed him or picked him up the night before. Clearly he remembers!!! But, the good news is, it usually only takes one semi-rough night for us to get back on track with decent sleep. Phew!</p>\n<h4>Why I Think This Method Was Successful For Us</h4>\n<p>I am not over here claiming Ryder\u2019s nighttime sleep will be permanently fantastic from here on out. I know enough by now to know that baby sleep ebbs and flows and can be a rollercoaster. (I was convinced we had Chase mostly \u201csleep trained\u201d at 6 months and then we had major regression. It is what it is.)</p>\n<p>I attribute most of the success we\u2019ve had with this method with Ryder\u2019s age. I knew I needed him to be old enough to replace his pacifier himself before we started sleep training because that\u2019s definitely his preferred method of self-soothing. Without his pacifier, I believe crying would\u2019ve lasted a lot longer and would have been a lot harder for me personally to handle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84709\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-1024x730.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"555\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-1024x730.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\"></a></p>\n<p><em>(Side note: If you\u2019re looking for a baby monitor with multiple camera compatibility, we are loving our <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RJZuJD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infant Optics monitor</a>. When I asked for monitor recs on Instagram, the Infant Optics camera was by far the most recommended and we\u2019ve been really happy with it. The monitor cycles through the cameras in Chase\u2019s room and Ryder\u2019s room every 12 seconds and can work with up to four camera.)</em></p>\n<p>Also, I waited until Ryder was nearly six months old to start sleep training for another important reason: I wasn\u2019t personally ready to start sleep training until he was six months old. Could we have started sooner? Probably. I read all the time about kids who consistently sleep through the night much earlier but I wasn\u2019t ready to move Ryder into his crib let alone begin sleep training until he was nearly six months old. I know some people tackle baby sleep much sooner and some much later. Different methods and timelines work for different babies and that\u2019s awesome. Everything related to babies seems to vary so much kid to kid so knowing your child and knowing yourself is key!</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s my very long-winded way of catching you guys up on our latest sleep training experience!

Chase was never a good sleeper and, couple that with the fact that his small 5 pound 10 ounce size had us following doctor\u2019s orders and setting alarms to wake him up every 2 hours to feed all throughout the day and night, sleep was pretty horrible for months and months after Chase was born.\n<p>We had little glimmers of hope here and there with a few weeks of good sleep peppered in but eventually I just threw in the towel and embraced the fact that Chase was going to be up in the night. I truly wouldn\u2019t say he officially slept through the night consistently until we weaned and I stopped nursing him at 15 months.</p>\n<p>For those who might be in a similar boat with a child over one year old, there IS hope! Chase is a great sleeper now and rarely wakes in the night. So everything I read about how important it is to establish consistent, long stretches of uninterrupted sleep for infants now makes me think \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s probably fabulous and admittedly preferred, but if it\u2019s not working for you or your baby, it will be okay. Your child won\u2019t be ruined forever.</p>\n<p>With Ryder, things instantly felt different. He was bigger at birth \u2014 7 pounds, 7 ounces \u2014 and in general just seemed to be a better sleeper and a more laid back baby. Almost immediately, we had longer stretches of sleep and I\u2019d find myself awake in the night starring at him shocked that he wasn\u2019t awake because I was anticipating consistent nighttime feeds for months on end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84705\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-854x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-854x1024.jpg 854w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-250x300.jpg 250w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-768x921.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\"></a></p>\n<p>By the time he was 2-3 months old, Ryder was often waking only one time in the night to nurse and I was thanking my lucky stars for a \u201cgood sleeper.\u201d I thought we lucked out and would coast through dropping his one remaining nighttime feed when the time was right.</p>\n<p>And then the four month sleep regression hit. And it hit us HARD.</p>\n<p>Seemingly overnight, Ryder was up at least three, often four, times a night. At first I thought it was just a fluke but then weeks passed by and I was still feeding him on demand and nursing him every 2-3 hours at night. It was BRUTAL and after two months of this, something needed to change. My mom instincts told me he was more than capable of longer stretches of sleep because we\u2019d seen him do it before. He was growing and gaining weight but his new middle-of-the-night snacks meant that his daytime feeds were becoming more much shorter and snack-like, too. I felt like for both his sake and my sanity, we needed to work to getting him back to longer stretches of sleep.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Gentle Cry-It-Out Method</strong></h4>\n<p>This time, unlike with Chase, I didn\u2019t read a bazillion sleep books that made me feel horrible about my baby. I had a general idea of what I wanted to do with Ryder when it came to sleep training. I didn\u2019t fear letting him cry in his crib a bit but I also didn\u2019t want to let him wail in his crib for hours on end. Then, during a media visit to Great Wolf Lodge, I met Lexi from the blog <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glitter, Inc</a>. She was so bubbly and friendly and I found myself spending a little too much time on her blog after we met because it was gorgeous and her upbeat personality was evident in her posts. And that\u2019s when I stumbled upon her post about the <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gentle Cry-It-Out Method</a>. It was a method she learned about after a phone call consultation with her husband\u2019s friend \u2014 a neurologist who specializes in pediatric sleep \u2014 and it sounded PERFECT!</p>\n<p>A quick note: In Lexi\u2019s blog post about the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method, she mentions implementing a sleep schedule during the day and <em>then</em> focuses on eliminating nighttime wake-ups. I really only followed the part about eliminating nighttime wake-ups because creating a sleep schedule for Ryder during the day is just a little complicated with Chase in the mix. I hope to establish some kind of a pattern when it comes to Ryder\u2019s daytime naps but right now he\u2019s a pretty good on-the-go napper and I don\u2019t want to mess with that!</p>\n<p>Also, if the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method interests you, PLEASE read <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lexi\u2019s post</a>. It\u2019s incredibly thorough and I\u2019m only sharing a rough highlight of how we used it in our house in a way that worked for us. Lexi\u2019s post has a lot more information so just consider this my super-short summary of what worked for our 6-month-old and how we applied aspects of the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method to our sleep training experience.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a brief overview of the way we implemented the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method to eliminate nighttime wake-ups with Ryder:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Watch for signs of sleepiness.</strong> These are very, very obvious with Ryder. Since he\u2019s generally not a fussy baby, when he gets fussy, he\u2019s usually either hungry or sleepy. At the end of the day, it\u2019s both\u2026 and it\u2019s time for bed!</li>\n<li><strong>Eliminate all distractions.\u00a0</strong>This means heading up to Ryder\u2019s nursery for a diaper change with the blinds pulled and lights low. I change and nurse Ryder with only the soft glow of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SGY27N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">salt lamp</a>\u00a0in his nursery.</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83711\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-1024x733.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"539\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-768x550.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px\"></a></p>\n<p><em>(Note: The blanket you see hanging off the crib was just there for decor purposes when I took pics of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/ryders-nursery-tour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ryder\u2019s nursery</a> before he was born.

I worried it wasn\u2019t going to work for Ryder (it was <em>crucial</em> for sleep for Chase!) but I think that when I initially tried putting Ryder in it, he was a little too young. I waited a month and then tried again and it worked like a charm for transitioning out of the swaddle and calming Ryder before and during sleep. (Note: The sleepsuit is not specifically part of the GCIO method but it is critical for us so I had to include it! They mention swaddling or whatever works for your baby\u2019s sleep.)</li>\n<li><strong>Turn on white noise machine.</strong> This is another big-time MUST for Ryder\u2019s sleep. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RDEUKL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">white noise machine</a> seems to help him relax and, as a bonus, it covers up random household noises that might wake him up in the night (Sadie barking, the heat coming on, etc.).</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84712\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-1024x795.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"581\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-1024x795.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-768x596.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\"></a></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Nurse Ryder and put him in his crib drowsy but not fully asleep.</strong>\u00a0Thankfully this wasn\u2019t a big change for us, as I\u2019ve been doing this since Ryder was a teeny baby.

The first few nights, they will, in all likelihood, cry for a full 5 minutes. Let baby cry for a full five minutes. (It will seem\u00a0<em>much</em>\u00a0longer, but remember, it\u2019s just 5 minutes.)</li>\n<li>When your phone alarm alerts you that 5 minutes have passed, quietly go into the room, put your hand on baby\u2019s chest, and in a soft soothing voice comfort them. If they use a pacifier, give it to them, and then quietly walk out of the room again.</li>\n<li>Set your alarm for another 5 minutes. When the alarm sounds, and if baby is still crying, go in again and repeat the above. At no point should you pick up the baby, feed the baby, etc. I KNOW it\u2019s hard. The first few nights, I myself stand outside our baby\u2019s door and tear up myself. It\u2019s brutal, and I hate it. But do you know what happens after that second 5-minute interval? Baby falls asleep. Sometimes it takes a third visit. At that point, set your alarm for 10 minutes, and ONLY go in after 10 minutes if baby is still crying.</li>\n<li>Repeat this process for as long as baby cries, extending the time you leave baby alone by about five minutes each time until he or she falls asleep. Repeat the same exact process on the second night, and again on the third.</li>\n</ul><p>Our sleep training coincided with transferring Ryder into his crib for the first time. I am not sure whether this is ideal or not, but I wanted to establish Ryder\u2019s crib as a place for sleep and \u2014 hopefully \u2014 GOOD sleep from day one. We followed all of the above bullet points as we attempted both the crib transfer and sleep training at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84710\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"588\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\"></a></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a five-day timeline of what the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method looked like for us:</p>\n<h4>NIGHT ONE</h4>\n<p>As I anticipated, this was our roughest night by far. I nursed Ryder and put him in his crib drowsy but not asleep. I\u2019ve been doing this from day one with Ryder, so I wasn\u2019t anticipating too much fussiness as he drifted off to sleep. He fell asleep fairly easily but, like clockwork, he woke up crying at 10 p.m. for what would\u2019ve been his first feed of the night. As noted in the Gentle Cry-It-Out method, I let him cry for 5 minutes before going into his room giving him his pacifier, placing my hand on his chest and quietly walking out of his room.</p>\n<p>I feel fortunate that Ryder seems to be an \u201cintermittent crier.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a thing or not but he never really seems to wail and wail non-stop. He\u2019ll often cry but his cries almost always hit a peak and then taper off which makes it a little easier on my mama heart when it comes to staying out of his room when he begins to cry. (Basically when his cries taper off, I am given a little glimmer of hope that they might stop altogether!)</p>\n<p>On night one, Ryder woke up at 10 p.m. and needed his pacifier replaced twice before falling back asleep. (I followed the five minute timeline each time before replacing his pacifier.) Ryder woke up again around midnight and that\u2019s when the fun began. We spent the next two hours playing paci-pong, setting timers and going back into his room to replace his pacifier in 5, 10, 15 and 20-minute intervals. I never stayed out of his room for more than 20 minutes but didn\u2019t really need to because eventually he fell asleep. It was almost like he was crying then resting then crying briefly again before sleeping. (Again, he seems to be an \u201cintermittent crier\u201d and never really wails and wails.) Ryder was never crying for long stretches during any of the paci-pong stage but I was awake the whole time and it was pretty hands-on as I set timers and replaced his pacifier at the designated intervals.</p>\n<p>After finally falling into a deeper sleep at 2 a.m., Ryder was up again at 4 a.m. for another two rounds of paci-pong and I went in to replace his pacifier twice after five minutes.\u00a0This happened again at 5:30 a.m. And then he was eventually up for the day.</p>\n<p>In the morning, I walked into Ryder\u2019s room to find a smiling, happy baby which was wonderful. (He wasn\u2019t even crying for me to come in\u2026 just peacefully playing with his Wubbanub!) Ryder ate like a champ in the morning which was also fantastic since his morning feeds were becoming really short and snack-like prior to sleep training thanks to his middle-of-the-night snack sessions.My breasts were hard as rocks and felt like they were going to explode and I\u2019m pretty sure I was more pumped for our morning nursing session than Ryder!</p>\n<p>So, in summary, our first night was a rough night for sure but I felt like I saw small progress after the long round of paci-pong at midnight when he seemed to take his paci and go back to sleep much faster at his 4 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. wake ups. I already believed we were on our way to better sleep!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT TWO</h4>\n<p>Night two marked a little bit of progress but began on a rough note. Ryder made it until 11 p.m. before crying \u2014 one hour later than the previous night \u2014 but spent the next 90 minutes crying on and off as I set timers and went in and out of his room replacing his pacifier at the designated timed intervals. He woke up again around 4 a.m. and I replaced his paci twice but then he didn\u2019t wake up until 7 a.m. when he was ready for his morning feed. Since he already missed one of his usual wake up times, this felt like MAJOR progress and I began to really trust that the Gently Cry-It-Out Method of timed intervals would work for us. I was honestly shocked night two went as well as it did after a pretty intense first night.</p>\n<h4>NIGHT THREE</h4>\n<p>Night three looked a lot like night two but the crying time decreased <em>dramatically</em> which felt like another major victory! Ryder was up twice but both times I only needed to replace his pacifier one time before he fell asleep. HUGE progress!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT FOUR</h4>\n<p>Night four Ryder woke up a few times and each time he fussed a little bit but fairly quickly found his pacifier and put it back in his mouth himself and went back to sleep almost immediately. On night four, I never had to go into his room and I was pretty darn psyched after this night!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT FIVE</h4>\n<p>Night five was a great one. It looked like night four but with even less wake-ups for Ryder. This is the night that I truly felt like I could say Ryder officially \u201cslept through the night\u201d which felt incredible.</p>\n<h4>What Nighttime Sleep Currently Looks Like Over Here: One Month Later</h4>\n<p>We\u2019re just under one month into our sleep training experience and I figured a little update about how sleep currently looks might be of interest. Once we implemented the Gentle Cry-It-Out method for nighttime sleep, we seemed to coast through nighttime sleep for a couple of weeks. I was convinced everything would be derailed when we traveled to Florida for Christmas, but Ryder shocked us by sleeping through the night every single night. It was incredible and I was so thankful! And yes, I packed all of his baby sleep essentials \u2014 noise machine, sleep suit and FIVE <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CaHmyv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wubbanubs</a>! I wasn\u2019t taking any chances!</p>\n<p>Since then, we\u2019ve had a few rough nights but, for the most part, nighttime sleep is going much, much better. Ryder seems to be able to self-soothe with the help of his pacifier almost every night buuut there have been a few nights where I\u2019ve gone in to nurse Ryder and have picked him up to soothe him because something seemed off. The one major hiccup we\u2019ve had with nighttime sleep occurred last week and seemed to coincide with Ryder\u2019s first tooth coming in.</p>\n<p>There have also been two instances where I\u2019ve felt like we had to almost re-train Ryder to sleep and both of these happened the night after I had previously nursed him or picked him up the night before. Clearly he remembers!!! But, the good news is, it usually only takes one semi-rough night for us to get back on track with decent sleep. Phew!</p>\n<h4>Why I Think This Method Was Successful For Us</h4>\n<p>I am not over here claiming Ryder\u2019s nighttime sleep will be permanently fantastic from here on out. I know enough by now to know that baby sleep ebbs and flows and can be a rollercoaster. (I was convinced we had Chase mostly \u201csleep trained\u201d at 6 months and then we had major regression. It is what it is.)</p>\n<p>I attribute most of the success we\u2019ve had with this method with Ryder\u2019s age. I knew I needed him to be old enough to replace his pacifier himself before we started sleep training because that\u2019s definitely his preferred method of self-soothing. Without his pacifier, I believe crying would\u2019ve lasted a lot longer and would have been a lot harder for me personally to handle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84709\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-1024x730.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"555\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-1024x730.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\"></a></p>\n<p><em>(Side note: If you\u2019re looking for a baby monitor with multiple camera compatibility, we are loving our <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RJZuJD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infant Optics monitor</a>. When I asked for monitor recs on Instagram, the Infant Optics camera was by far the most recommended and we\u2019ve been really happy with it. The monitor cycles through the cameras in Chase\u2019s room and Ryder\u2019s room every 12 seconds and can work with up to four camera.)</em></p>\n<p>Also, I waited until Ryder was nearly six months old to start sleep training for another important reason: I wasn\u2019t personally ready to start sleep training until he was six months old. Could we have started sooner? Probably. I read all the time about kids who consistently sleep through the night much earlier but I wasn\u2019t ready to move Ryder into his crib let alone begin sleep training until he was nearly six months old. I know some people tackle baby sleep much sooner and some much later. Different methods and timelines work for different babies and that\u2019s awesome. Everything related to babies seems to vary so much kid to kid so knowing your child and knowing yourself is key!</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s my very long-winded way of catching you guys up on our latest sleep training experience!

I truly wouldn&rsquo;t say he officially slept through the night consistently until we weaned and I stopped nursing him at 15 months.</p>\n<p>For those who might be in a similar boat with a child over one year old, there IS hope! Chase is a great sleeper now and rarely wakes in the night. So everything I read about how important it is to establish consistent, long stretches of uninterrupted sleep for infants now makes me think &mdash; yeah, that&rsquo;s probably fabulous and admittedly preferred, but if it&rsquo;s not working for you or your baby, it will be okay. Your child won&rsquo;t be ruined forever.</p>\n<p>With Ryder, things instantly felt different. He was bigger at birth &mdash; 7 pounds, 7 ounces &mdash; and in general just seemed to be a better sleeper and a more laid back baby. Almost immediately, we had longer stretches of sleep and I&rsquo;d find myself awake in the night starring at him shocked that he wasn&rsquo;t awake because I was anticipating consistent nighttime feeds for months on end.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_7673-854x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>By the time he was 2-3 months old, Ryder was often waking only one time in the night to nurse and I was thanking my lucky stars for a &ldquo;good sleeper.&rdquo; I thought we lucked out and would coast through dropping his one remaining nighttime feed when the time was right.</p>\n<p>And then the four month sleep regression hit. And it hit us HARD.</p>\n<p>Seemingly overnight, Ryder was up at least three, often four, times a night. At first I thought it was just a fluke but then weeks passed by and I was still feeding him on demand and nursing him every 2-3 hours at night. It was BRUTAL and after two months of this, something needed to change. My mom instincts told me he was more than capable of longer stretches of sleep because we&rsquo;d seen him do it before. He was growing and gaining weight but his new middle-of-the-night snacks meant that his daytime feeds were becoming more much shorter and snack-like, too. I felt like for both his sake and my sanity, we needed to work to getting him back to longer stretches of sleep.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Gentle Cry-It-Out Method</strong></h4>\n<p>This time, unlike with Chase, I didn&rsquo;t read a bazillion sleep books that made me feel horrible about my baby. I had a general idea of what I wanted to do with Ryder when it came to sleep training. I didn&rsquo;t fear letting him cry in his crib a bit but I also didn&rsquo;t want to let him wail in his crib for hours on end. Then, during a media visit to Great Wolf Lodge, I met Lexi from the blog <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Glitter, Inc</a>. She was so bubbly and friendly and I found myself spending a little too much time on her blog after we met because it was gorgeous and her upbeat personality was evident in her posts. And that&rsquo;s when I stumbled upon her post about the <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\">Gentle Cry-It-Out Method</a>. It was a method she learned about after a phone call consultation with her husband&rsquo;s friend &mdash; a neurologist who specializes in pediatric sleep &mdash; and it sounded PERFECT!</p>\n<p>A quick note: In Lexi&rsquo;s blog post about the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method, she mentions implementing a sleep schedule during the day and <em>then</em> focuses on eliminating nighttime wake-ups. I really only followed the part about eliminating nighttime wake-ups because creating a sleep schedule for Ryder during the day is just a little complicated with Chase in the mix. I hope to establish some kind of a pattern when it comes to Ryder&rsquo;s daytime naps but right now he&rsquo;s a pretty good on-the-go napper and I don&rsquo;t want to mess with that!</p>\n<p>Also, if the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method interests you, PLEASE read <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\">Lexi&rsquo;s post</a>. It&rsquo;s incredibly thorough and I&rsquo;m only sharing a rough highlight of how we used it in our house in a way that worked for us. Lexi&rsquo;s post has a lot more information so just consider this my super-short summary of what worked for our 6-month-old and how we applied aspects of the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method to our sleep training experience.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief overview of the way we implemented the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method to eliminate nighttime wake-ups with Ryder:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Watch for signs of sleepiness.</strong> These are very, very obvious with Ryder. Since he&rsquo;s generally not a fussy baby, when he gets fussy, he&rsquo;s usually either hungry or sleepy. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s both&hellip; and it&rsquo;s time for bed!</li>\n<li><strong>Eliminate all distractions.&nbsp;</strong>This means heading up to Ryder&rsquo;s nursery for a diaper change with the blinds pulled and lights low. I change and nurse Ryder with only the soft glow of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SGY27N\" target=\"_blank\">salt lamp</a>&nbsp;in his nursery.</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9949-001-1024x733.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><em>(Note: The blanket you see hanging off the crib was just there for decor purposes when I took pics of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/ryders-nursery-tour/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryder&rsquo;s nursery</a> before he was born. He sleeps in a crib free of anything other than his Wubbanubs.)&nbsp;</em></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Put Ryder in his sleep suit.</strong>&nbsp;The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VFmDM7\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Merlin Sleepsuit</a> is a lifesaver and it seems to instantly calm Ryder down. I worried it wasn&rsquo;t going to work for Ryder (it was <em>crucial</em> for sleep for Chase!) but I think that when I initially tried putting Ryder in it, he was a little too young. I waited a month and then tried again and it worked like a charm for transitioning out of the swaddle and calming Ryder before and during sleep. (Note: The sleepsuit is not specifically part of the GCIO method but it is critical for us so I had to include it! They mention swaddling or whatever works for your baby&rsquo;s sleep.)</li>\n<li><strong>Turn on white noise machine.</strong> This is another big-time MUST for Ryder&rsquo;s sleep. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RDEUKL\" target=\"_blank\">white noise machine</a> seems to help him relax and, as a bonus, it covers up random household noises that might wake him up in the night (Sadie barking, the heat coming on, etc.).</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3426-1024x795.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Nurse Ryder and put him in his crib drowsy but not fully asleep.</strong>&nbsp;Thankfully this wasn&rsquo;t a big change for us, as I&rsquo;ve been doing this since Ryder was a teeny baby. I still always try to put him in his crib before he&rsquo;s completely zonked out.</li>\n<li><strong>Give Ryder a pacifier, gently place my hand on his belly, say &ldquo;shhhh&rdquo; over and over again as I walk out the door.</strong>&nbsp;Note: When I say &ldquo;give Ryder a pacifier,&rdquo; what I really mean is &ldquo;give Ryder a pacifier and surround him with three more pacifiers&rdquo; before I walk out the door. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CaHmyv\" target=\"_blank\">Wubbanubs</a>/pacifiers are KEY for Ryder&rsquo;s self-soothing abilities right now and I want one to be within his reach at all times if possible.</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3434-1024x777.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Follow the Gently Cry-It-Out timeline for checking on Ryder if crying begins.&nbsp;</strong>Here&rsquo;s where the &ldquo;sleep training&rdquo; aspect of the Gentle Cry-It-Out method kicks in. See below!</li>\n</ul><p><em>As noted by Lexi in <a href=\"https://glitterinc.com/2018/09/how-we-taught-our-baby-to-sleep-through-the-night/\" target=\"_blank\">her words</a>, here&rsquo;s the timeline for checking on baby if implementing the Gentle Cry-It-Out method:</em></p>\n<ul><li>If baby cries, set an alarm on your phone for 5 minutes and stand and wait just outside of the door. The first few nights, they will, in all likelihood, cry for a full 5 minutes. Let baby cry for a full five minutes. (It will seem&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;longer, but remember, it&rsquo;s just 5 minutes.)</li>\n<li>When your phone alarm alerts you that 5 minutes have passed, quietly go into the room, put your hand on baby&rsquo;s chest, and in a soft soothing voice comfort them. If they use a pacifier, give it to them, and then quietly walk out of the room again.</li>\n<li>Set your alarm for another 5 minutes. When the alarm sounds, and if baby is still crying, go in again and repeat the above. At no point should you pick up the baby, feed the baby, etc. I KNOW it&rsquo;s hard. The first few nights, I myself stand outside our baby&rsquo;s door and tear up myself. It&rsquo;s brutal, and I hate it. But do you know what happens after that second 5-minute interval? Baby falls asleep. Sometimes it takes a third visit. At that point, set your alarm for 10 minutes, and ONLY go in after 10 minutes if baby is still crying.</li>\n<li>Repeat this process for as long as baby cries, extending the time you leave baby alone by about five minutes each time until he or she falls asleep. Repeat the same exact process on the second night, and again on the third.</li>\n</ul><p>Our sleep training coincided with transferring Ryder into his crib for the first time. I am not sure whether this is ideal or not, but I wanted to establish Ryder&rsquo;s crib as a place for sleep and &mdash; hopefully &mdash; GOOD sleep from day one. We followed all of the above bullet points as we attempted both the crib transfer and sleep training at once.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3407-1024x683.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a five-day timeline of what the Gentle Cry-It-Out Method looked like for us:</p>\n<h4>NIGHT ONE</h4>\n<p>As I anticipated, this was our roughest night by far. I nursed Ryder and put him in his crib drowsy but not asleep. I&rsquo;ve been doing this from day one with Ryder, so I wasn&rsquo;t anticipating too much fussiness as he drifted off to sleep. He fell asleep fairly easily but, like clockwork, he woke up crying at 10 p.m. for what would&rsquo;ve been his first feed of the night. As noted in the Gentle Cry-It-Out method, I let him cry for 5 minutes before going into his room giving him his pacifier, placing my hand on his chest and quietly walking out of his room.</p>\n<p>I feel fortunate that Ryder seems to be an &ldquo;intermittent crier.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s a thing or not but he never really seems to wail and wail non-stop. He&rsquo;ll often cry but his cries almost always hit a peak and then taper off which makes it a little easier on my mama heart when it comes to staying out of his room when he begins to cry. (Basically when his cries taper off, I am given a little glimmer of hope that they might stop altogether!)</p>\n<p>On night one, Ryder woke up at 10 p.m. and needed his pacifier replaced twice before falling back asleep. (I followed the five minute timeline each time before replacing his pacifier.) Ryder woke up again around midnight and that&rsquo;s when the fun began. We spent the next two hours playing paci-pong, setting timers and going back into his room to replace his pacifier in 5, 10, 15 and 20-minute intervals. I never stayed out of his room for more than 20 minutes but didn&rsquo;t really need to because eventually he fell asleep. It was almost like he was crying then resting then crying briefly again before sleeping. (Again, he seems to be an &ldquo;intermittent crier&rdquo; and never really wails and wails.) Ryder was never crying for long stretches during any of the paci-pong stage but I was awake the whole time and it was pretty hands-on as I set timers and replaced his pacifier at the designated intervals.</p>\n<p>After finally falling into a deeper sleep at 2 a.m., Ryder was up again at 4 a.m. for another two rounds of paci-pong and I went in to replace his pacifier twice after five minutes.&nbsp;This happened again at 5:30 a.m. And then he was eventually up for the day.</p>\n<p>In the morning, I walked into Ryder&rsquo;s room to find a smiling, happy baby which was wonderful. (He wasn&rsquo;t even crying for me to come in&hellip; just peacefully playing with his Wubbanub!) Ryder ate like a champ in the morning which was also fantastic since his morning feeds were becoming really short and snack-like prior to sleep training thanks to his middle-of-the-night snack sessions.My breasts were hard as rocks and felt like they were going to explode and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was more pumped for our morning nursing session than Ryder!</p>\n<p>So, in summary, our first night was a rough night for sure but I felt like I saw small progress after the long round of paci-pong at midnight when he seemed to take his paci and go back to sleep much faster at his 4 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. wake ups. I already believed we were on our way to better sleep!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT TWO</h4>\n<p>Night two marked a little bit of progress but began on a rough note. Ryder made it until 11 p.m. before crying &mdash; one hour later than the previous night &mdash; but spent the next 90 minutes crying on and off as I set timers and went in and out of his room replacing his pacifier at the designated timed intervals. He woke up again around 4 a.m. and I replaced his paci twice but then he didn&rsquo;t wake up until 7 a.m. when he was ready for his morning feed. Since he already missed one of his usual wake up times, this felt like MAJOR progress and I began to really trust that the Gently Cry-It-Out Method of timed intervals would work for us. I was honestly shocked night two went as well as it did after a pretty intense first night.</p>\n<h4>NIGHT THREE</h4>\n<p>Night three looked a lot like night two but the crying time decreased <em>dramatically</em> which felt like another major victory! Ryder was up twice but both times I only needed to replace his pacifier one time before he fell asleep. HUGE progress!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT FOUR</h4>\n<p>Night four Ryder woke up a few times and each time he fussed a little bit but fairly quickly found his pacifier and put it back in his mouth himself and went back to sleep almost immediately. On night four, I never had to go into his room and I was pretty darn psyched after this night!</p>\n<h4>NIGHT FIVE</h4>\n<p>Night five was a great one. It looked like night four but with even less wake-ups for Ryder. This is the night that I truly felt like I could say Ryder officially &ldquo;slept through the night&rdquo; which felt incredible.</p>\n<h4>What Nighttime Sleep Currently Looks Like Over Here: One Month Later</h4>\n<p>We&rsquo;re just under one month into our sleep training experience and I figured a little update about how sleep currently looks might be of interest. Once we implemented the Gentle Cry-It-Out method for nighttime sleep, we seemed to coast through nighttime sleep for a couple of weeks. I was convinced everything would be derailed when we traveled to Florida for Christmas, but Ryder shocked us by sleeping through the night every single night. It was incredible and I was so thankful! And yes, I packed all of his baby sleep essentials &mdash; noise machine, sleep suit and FIVE <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CaHmyv\" target=\"_blank\">Wubbanubs</a>! I wasn&rsquo;t taking any chances!</p>\n<p>Since then, we&rsquo;ve had a few rough nights but, for the most part, nighttime sleep is going much, much better. Ryder seems to be able to self-soothe with the help of his pacifier almost every night buuut there have been a few nights where I&rsquo;ve gone in to nurse Ryder and have picked him up to soothe him because something seemed off. The one major hiccup we&rsquo;ve had with nighttime sleep occurred last week and seemed to coincide with Ryder&rsquo;s first tooth coming in.</p>\n<p>There have also been two instances where I&rsquo;ve felt like we had to almost re-train Ryder to sleep and both of these happened the night after I had previously nursed him or picked him up the night before. Clearly he remembers!!! But, the good news is, it usually only takes one semi-rough night for us to get back on track with decent sleep. Phew!</p>\n<h4>Why I Think This Method Was Successful For Us</h4>\n<p>I am not over here claiming Ryder&rsquo;s nighttime sleep will be permanently fantastic from here on out. I know enough by now to know that baby sleep ebbs and flows and can be a rollercoaster. (I was convinced we had Chase mostly &ldquo;sleep trained&rdquo; at 6 months and then we had major regression. It is what it is.)</p>\n<p>I attribute most of the success we&rsquo;ve had with this method with Ryder&rsquo;s age. I knew I needed him to be old enough to replace his pacifier himself before we started sleep training because that&rsquo;s definitely his preferred method of self-soothing. Without his pacifier, I believe crying would&rsquo;ve lasted a lot longer and would have been a lot harder for me personally to handle.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3388-1024x730.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><em>(Side note: If you&rsquo;re looking for a baby monitor with multiple camera compatibility, we are loving our <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RJZuJD\" target=\"_blank\">Infant Optics monitor</a>. When I asked for monitor recs on Instagram, the Infant Optics camera was by far the most recommended and we&rsquo;ve been really happy with it. The monitor cycles through the cameras in Chase&rsquo;s room and Ryder&rsquo;s room every 12 seconds and can work with up to four camera.)</em></p>\n<p>Also, I waited until Ryder was nearly six months old to start sleep training for another important reason: I wasn&rsquo;t personally ready to start sleep training until he was six months old. Could we have started sooner? Probably. I read all the time about kids who consistently sleep through the night much earlier but I wasn&rsquo;t ready to move Ryder into his crib let alone begin sleep training until he was nearly six months old. I know some people tackle baby sleep much sooner and some much later. Different methods and timelines work for different babies and that&rsquo;s awesome. Everything related to babies seems to vary so much kid to kid so knowing your child and knowing yourself is key!</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s my very long-winded way of catching you guys up on our latest sleep training experience!
