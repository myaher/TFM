        "body": "<h1>I tried to write a fanfic</h1><p>\tThe Night King prowled across the godswood. The trees crackled around them with dragon fire. Ghost was injured and panting atop a burnin  branch, too broken to save himself from such an agonizing death. Jon fell in combat with the creature  standing before her. Danaerys was knocked from her dragon hours before. Drogon had gone wild with grief and breathed fire on the living and the dead. </p><p>\tSansa was supposed to retreat to the crypts with the old and young. She was supposed to wait it out until the food ran dry then lead the remaining people south. The dead didn\u2019t swim. They were to break the ice and make for the coast. Perhaps try to meet up with Nymeria. Jon had hoped that Rhaegal would protect them after his death. The green dragon tried, but with a mangled wing the wights overran him in minutes. </p><p>\tShe couldn\u2019t bring herself to hide. This was her home. She was the last Stark alive; she\u2019d had to burn Arya herself. Bran was dead too, but he hadn\u2019t Brandon Stark for a time anyway. </p><p>\tThe sword was unfamiliar in her grip. Brienne and sweet Pod had taught her the basics. The greatsword, once Sam Tarly\u2019s and then Sandor\u2019s Clegane\u2019s and now her\u2019s, was far too heavy for her frame. She glanced from Ghost to the Night King and back again. Ghost was all that was left of her family. The Lady of Winterfell would not let her last kin die in pain. She darted to the left, but before she managed even a step, a sharp, cold pain erupted through her belly.</p><p>****</p><p>\tA part of Sansa had always craved death. She\u2019d given up on the gods a long time ago. She wondered if it would be a welcomed nothing or if there would be seven heavens and hells. She hoped it would be an eternal, infinite blackness that her soul was free to drift through. </p><p>\tDeath was Winterfell. It was the smell of cold rain and the remnants of a fire. It was the heat seeping through the stone walls and the accents of the people in the halls. Sansa allowed herself a small smile. </p><p>\t\u201cAre you awake?\u201d A familiar voice demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get up.\u201d </p><p>\tSansa\u2019s eyes flew open. Her sister loomed over her, years younger and with a great, thick scar around her neck. </p><p>\t\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\tArya nodded fervently. \u201cI know.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWhat is this? He killed me, I know he killed me!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cValar Doaeris,\u201d her sister intoned gravely. </p><p>\tAll men must serve.</p><p>\t\u201cI thought it was over,\u201d Sansa whispered. </p><p>\tThe door to their room crashed against the wall. Sansa sat upright. Arya wielded a candlestick at the intruder. </p><p>\tIt was only Jon, face smooth and his eye still scarred, breathing heavily. It only took one look for his face to drop. He cursed darkly as he eyed Arya\u2019s throat. </p><p>\t\u201cJon? What is the matter with you?!\u201d Someone called down the hall. Jon hurried to close the door, but Robb threw himself in the opening and wrestled it open. He stopped short, blue eyes wide, at the sight of Arya. Behind him, Jon shut the door and barred it. He went as far to move the girl\u2019s trunk of old toys in front of it. </p><p>\t\u201cBran?\u201d Sansa demanded. \u201cRickon?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Robb asked. \u201cWho? Arya, what-\u201c</p><p>\tShe ignored her brother and looked to Jon. He merely shook his head.  \u201cThey weren\u2019t in the nursery.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cArya!\u201d Robb cried. \u201cWhat happened-?!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhere are Bran and Rickon?\u201d Arya asked. </p><p>\t\u201cBran and Rickon? Who in seven hells are bran and Rickon? Are you talking about Uncle Brandon? He died long ago. What is on your neck, Arya?\u201d</p><p>\tRobb went on asking questions but his siblings paid him no mind. They stared at on another, faces grim and hearts pounding. It was obvious;  Bran - no, the Three Eyed Raven - had done something terrible. </p><p>\t\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Arya whispered in horror. </p><p>\t\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in the godswood,\u201d Sansa supplied. </p><p>\tArya looked at her sharply. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBecause she was in the godswood. With Ghost,\u201d Jon answered.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be in the crypts,\u201d Arya snapped. </p><p>\t\u201cOnly death may pay for life,\u201d Jon interrupted. \u201cThe Red Woman once said only death may pay for life. If there are three of us-\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cFather!\u201d Arya cried.  </p><p>\tSansa jumped out of bed as Jon lunged for the trunk. </p><p>\t\u201cSANSA!\u201d Robb bellowed. She\u2019d never heard him like this, but she\u2019d imagined it. It must have been the voice he used to command his armies across the Neck. \u201cWhat the bloody hell is going- your arm&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\tThe white night gown only reached her elbows. She\u2019d taken care to cover every inch of her skin from neck to toe before. An angry pink scar in the shape of a dog bite began on her left forearm and twisted down to just above her wrist. Jon straightened, his face very white and his full lips pressing into a thin line.</p><p>\t\u201cMy dressing robe, Robb,\u201d Sansa demanded calmly. She glanced at the grey and pink garment over his shoulder. \t</p><p>\tHe grabbed it from the hook, but didn\u2019t hand it over. \u201cNot until you tell me what is happening.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWe will. After we find Father,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\tHe rolled his eyes but tossed it to her nonetheless.</p><p>\tArya rounded on him. \u201cSo Father\u2019s alright then?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. But with you lot-\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cMother?\u201d Sansa asked. </p><p>\t\u201cMother? Sansa&hellip;.Mother died birthing Arya. You know that. Are you alright? Come, I\u2019ll take you to Maester Lewin.\u201d</p><p>\tSansa took a shuddering breath. Arya looked at her feet, her grey eyes shining with tears.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jon said softly. </p><p>\tA knock sounded at the door just before it rattled. </p><p>\t\u201cGirls?\u201d A woman called.</p><p>\t\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Sansa said in a sweet voice.</p><p>\t\u201cIs everything okay, Lady Sansa?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes. Just a minute, please.\u201d</p><p>\tThe woman hesitated for a moment, but continued down the hall soon after. Sansa sat on her bed, pulling the robe tight around herself. Jon joined her and Arya soon after. Robb, still bewildered and more than a bit angry, lowered himself onto Arya\u2019s bed across from them. </p><p>\tIt made sense, she thought, resting her head on Jon\u2019s shoulder. Catelyn Tully was not a Stark. She did not have ice in her veins. Though Bran and Rickon did and Bran was too important to the old gods to be tossed away. Perhaps he was already there, already learning from the man that called himself Bloodraven and the Children of the Forest. Would they demand another life for him if he\u2019d already dedicated his to them?</p><p>\t\u201cWho was it that went north with Bran?\u201d Sansa asked.</p><p>\t\u201cThe Reed children and Hodor,\u201d Jon answered.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll need to send a raven,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cPerhaps they might be able to tell us something.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI wish you were able to tell me something,\u201d Robb glowered.</p><p>\tJon sighed deeply, the exhaustion heavy in his bones. This was the second time he\u2019d died and come back. It made her glad she wasn\u2019t a god. She didn\u2019t want to be the one to meet him when he finally died. She\u2019d seen him angry. Danaerys called it his dragon fire but she\u2019d never seen how wild the Starks could get. </p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll have to tell them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much to do on our own.\u201d</p><p>\tArya stood. \u201cI\u2019ll go fetch Father.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNot with your throat like-\u201c Sansa was cut off by another knock at the door. </p><p>\t\u201cGirls?\u201d The woman called again.</p><p>\t\u201cWe need Father,\u201d Arya shouted.</p><p>\tThe woman was quiet for a moment before she said through the door, \u201cIf the Lady has flowered I can fetch-\u201c</p><p>\tArya rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, she isn\u2019t bleeding. None of us are bleeding. I won\u2019t open this door for anyone but Lord Stark so you better not fetch anyone but him.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cArya!\u201d Robb chastised her. </p><p>\t\u201cLord Robb?!\u201d The woman exclaimed. </p><p>\t\u201cMy father NOW!\u201d Arya yelled. </p><p>\tThe woman\u2019s footsteps scurried off down the hall. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re not half as scary anymore,\u201d Sansa teased. </p><p>\t\u201cHow old are we anyway?\u201d She scowled, plopping down on a cushion beside a dollhouse. \u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBefore King\u2019s Landing, I\u2019d wager,\u201d Jon said as he rubbed his smooth chin. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have the wolves yet.\u201d</p><p>\tLadyLadyLady. Sansa\u2019s breath caught. To have her direwolf, to have her fur and fangs and love was too much to ask. It was more than she deserved. Though maybe it was a mercy that Lady had been killed gently in the north. </p><p>The Starks were silent, each contemplating the morning, until someone pounded on the door. </p><p>\u201cRobb! Girls! Open this door now!\u201d</p><p>Robb hurried to unlatch the lock. He pulled the door back to reveal Ned Stark towering in the doorway. </p>",

She glanced at the grey and pink garment over his shoulder. \t</p><p>\tHe grabbed it from the hook, but didn\u2019t hand it over. \u201cNot until you tell me what is happening.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWe will. After we find Father,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\tHe rolled his eyes but tossed it to her nonetheless.</p><p>\tArya rounded on him. \u201cSo Father\u2019s alright then?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. But with you lot-\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cMother?\u201d Sansa asked. </p><p>\t\u201cMother? Sansa\u2026.Mother died birthing Arya. You know that. Are you alright? Come, I\u2019ll take you to Maester Lewin.\u201d</p><p>\tSansa took a shuddering breath. Arya looked at her feet, her grey eyes shining with tears.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jon said softly. </p><p>\tA knock sounded at the door just before it rattled. </p><p>\t\u201cGirls?\u201d A woman called.</p><p>\t\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Sansa said in a sweet voice.</p><p>\t\u201cIs everything okay, Lady Sansa?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes. Just a minute, please.\u201d</p><p>\tThe woman hesitated for a moment, but continued down the hall soon after. Sansa sat on her bed, pulling the robe tight around herself. Jon joined her and Arya soon after. Robb, still bewildered and more than a bit angry, lowered himself onto Arya\u2019s bed across from them. </p><p>\tIt made sense, she thought, resting her head on Jon\u2019s shoulder. Catelyn Tully was not a Stark. She did not have ice in her veins. Though Bran and Rickon did and Bran was too important to the old gods to be tossed away. Perhaps he was already there, already learning from the man that called himself Bloodraven and the Children of the Forest. Would they demand another life for him if he\u2019d already dedicated his to them?</p><p>\t\u201cWho was it that went north with Bran?\u201d Sansa asked.</p><p>\t\u201cThe Reed children and Hodor,\u201d Jon answered.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll need to send a raven,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cPerhaps they might be able to tell us something.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI wish you were able to tell me something,\u201d Robb glowered.</p><p>\tJon sighed deeply, the exhaustion heavy in his bones. This was the second time he\u2019d died and come back. It made her glad she wasn\u2019t a god. She didn\u2019t want to be the one to meet him when he finally died. She\u2019d seen him angry. Danaerys called it his dragon fire but she\u2019d never seen how wild the Starks could get. </p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll have to tell them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much to do on our own.\u201d</p><p>\tArya stood. \u201cI\u2019ll go fetch Father.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNot with your throat like-\u201c Sansa was cut off by another knock at the door. </p><p>\t\u201cGirls?\u201d The woman called again.</p><p>\t\u201cWe need Father,\u201d Arya shouted.</p><p>\tThe woman was quiet for a moment before she said through the door, \u201cIf the Lady has flowered I can fetch-\u201c</p><p>\tArya rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, she isn\u2019t bleeding. None of us are bleeding. I won\u2019t open this door for anyone but Lord Stark so you better not fetch anyone but him.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cArya!\u201d Robb chastised her. </p><p>\t\u201cLord Robb?!\u201d The woman exclaimed. </p><p>\t\u201cMy father NOW!\u201d Arya yelled. </p><p>\tThe woman\u2019s footsteps scurried off down the hall. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re not half as scary anymore,\u201d Sansa teased. </p><p>\t\u201cHow old are we anyway?\u201d She scowled, plopping down on a cushion beside a dollhouse. \u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBefore King\u2019s Landing, I\u2019d wager,\u201d Jon said as he rubbed his smooth chin. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have the wolves yet.\u201d</p><p>\tLadyLadyLady. Sansa\u2019s breath caught. To have her direwolf, to have her fur and fangs and love was too much to ask. It was more than she deserved. Though maybe it was a mercy that Lady had been killed gently in the north. </p><p>The Starks were silent, each contemplating the morning, until someone pounded on the door. </p><p>\u201cRobb! Girls! Open this door now!\u201d</p><p>Robb hurried to unlatch the lock. He pulled the door back to reveal Ned Stark towering in the doorway. </p></p>",

Ghost was injured and panting atop a burnin  branch, too broken to save himself from such an agonizing death. Jon fell in combat with the creature  standing before her. Danaerys was knocked from her dragon hours before. Drogon had gone wild with grief and breathed fire on the living and the dead. </p><p>\tSansa was supposed to retreat to the crypts with the old and young. She was supposed to wait it out until the food ran dry then lead the remaining people south. The dead didn\u2019t swim. They were to break the ice and make for the coast. Perhaps try to meet up with Nymeria. Jon had hoped that Rhaegal would protect them after his death. The green dragon tried, but with a mangled wing the wights overran him in minutes. </p><p>\tShe couldn\u2019t bring herself to hide. This was her home. She was the last Stark alive; she\u2019d had to burn Arya herself. Bran was dead too, but he hadn\u2019t Brandon Stark for a time anyway. </p><p>\tThe sword was unfamiliar in her grip. Brienne and sweet Pod had taught her the basics. The greatsword, once Sam Tarly\u2019s and then Sandor\u2019s Clegane\u2019s and now her\u2019s, was far too heavy for her frame. She glanced from Ghost to the Night King and back again. Ghost was all that was left of her family. The Lady of Winterfell would not let her last kin die in pain. She darted to the left, but before she managed even a step, a sharp, cold pain erupted through her belly.</p><p>****</p><p>\tA part of Sansa had always craved death. She\u2019d given up on the gods a long time ago. She wondered if it would be a welcomed nothing or if there would be seven heavens and hells. She hoped it would be an eternal, infinite blackness that her soul was free to drift through. </p><p>\tDeath was Winterfell. It was the smell of cold rain and the remnants of a fire. It was the heat seeping through the stone walls and the accents of the people in the halls. Sansa allowed herself a small smile. </p><p>\t\u201cAre you awake?\u201d A familiar voice demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get up.\u201d </p><p>\tSansa\u2019s eyes flew open. Her sister loomed over her, years younger and with a great, thick scar around her neck. </p><p>\t\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\tArya nodded fervently. \u201cI know.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWhat is this? He killed me, I know he killed me!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cValar Doaeris,\u201d her sister intoned gravely. </p><p>\tAll men must serve.</p><p>\t\u201cI thought it was over,\u201d Sansa whispered. </p><p>\tThe door to their room crashed against the wall. Sansa sat upright. Arya wielded a candlestick at the intruder. </p><p>\tIt was only Jon, face smooth and his eye still scarred, breathing heavily. It only took one look for his face to drop. He cursed darkly as he eyed Arya\u2019s throat. </p><p>\t\u201cJon? What is the matter with you?!\u201d Someone called down the hall. Jon hurried to close the door, but Robb threw himself in the opening and wrestled it open. He stopped short, blue eyes wide, at the sight of Arya. Behind him, Jon shut the door and barred it. He went as far to move the girl\u2019s trunk of old toys in front of it. </p><p>\t\u201cBran?\u201d Sansa demanded. \u201cRickon?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Robb asked. \u201cWho? Arya, what-\u201c</p><p>\tShe ignored her brother and looked to Jon. He merely shook his head.  \u201cThey weren\u2019t in the nursery.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cArya!\u201d Robb cried. \u201cWhat happened-?!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhere are Bran and Rickon?\u201d Arya asked. </p><p>\t\u201cBran and Rickon? Who in seven hells are bran and Rickon? Are you talking about Uncle Brandon? He died long ago. What is on your neck, Arya?\u201d</p><p>\tRobb went on asking questions but his siblings paid him no mind. They stared at on another, faces grim and hearts pounding. It was obvious;  Bran - no, the Three Eyed Raven - had done something terrible. </p><p>\t\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Arya whispered in horror. </p><p>\t\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in the godswood,\u201d Sansa supplied. </p><p>\tArya looked at her sharply. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBecause she was in the godswood. With Ghost,\u201d Jon answered.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be in the crypts,\u201d Arya snapped. </p><p>\t\u201cOnly death may pay for life,\u201d Jon interrupted. \u201cThe Red Woman once said only death may pay for life. If there are three of us-\u201c</p><p>\t\u201cFather!\u201d Arya cried.  </p><p>\tSansa jumped out of bed as Jon lunged for the trunk. </p><p>\t\u201cSANSA!\u201d Robb bellowed. She\u2019d never heard him like this, but she\u2019d imagined it. It must have been the voice he used to command his armies across the Neck. \u201cWhat the bloody hell is going- your arm\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tThe white night gown only reached her elbows. She\u2019d taken care to cover every inch of her skin from neck to toe before. An angry pink scar in the shape of a dog bite began on her left forearm and twisted down to just above her wrist. Jon straightened, his face very white and his full lips pressing into a thin line.</p><p>\t\u201cMy dressing robe, Robb,\u201d Sansa demanded calmly.

Arya looked at her feet, her grey eyes shining with tears.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Jon said softly. </p><p>\tA knock sounded at the door just before it rattled. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Girls?&rdquo; A woman called.</p><p>\t&ldquo;In a minute,&rdquo; Sansa said in a sweet voice.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Is everything okay, Lady Sansa?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes. Just a minute, please.&rdquo;</p><p>\tThe woman hesitated for a moment, but continued down the hall soon after. Sansa sat on her bed, pulling the robe tight around herself. Jon joined her and Arya soon after. Robb, still bewildered and more than a bit angry, lowered himself onto Arya&rsquo;s bed across from them. </p><p>\tIt made sense, she thought, resting her head on Jon&rsquo;s shoulder. Catelyn Tully was not a Stark. She did not have ice in her veins. Though Bran and Rickon did and Bran was too important to the old gods to be tossed away. Perhaps he was already there, already learning from the man that called himself Bloodraven and the Children of the Forest. Would they demand another life for him if he&rsquo;d already dedicated his to them?</p><p>\t&ldquo;Who was it that went north with Bran?&rdquo; Sansa asked.</p><p>\t&ldquo;The Reed children and Hodor,&rdquo; Jon answered.</p><p>\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need to send a raven,&rdquo; Sansa said. &ldquo;Perhaps they might be able to tell us something.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I wish you were able to tell me something,&rdquo; Robb glowered.</p><p>\tJon sighed deeply, the exhaustion heavy in his bones. This was the second time he&rsquo;d died and come back. It made her glad she wasn&rsquo;t a god. She didn&rsquo;t want to be the one to meet him when he finally died. She&rsquo;d seen him angry. Danaerys called it his dragon fire but she&rsquo;d never seen how wild the Starks could get. </p><p>\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to tell them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much to do on our own.&rdquo;</p><p>\tArya stood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go fetch Father.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not with your throat like-&ldquo; Sansa was cut off by another knock at the door. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Girls?&rdquo; The woman called again.</p><p>\t&ldquo;We need Father,&rdquo; Arya shouted.</p><p>\tThe woman was quiet for a moment before she said through the door, &ldquo;If the Lady has flowered I can fetch-&ldquo;</p><p>\tArya rolled her eyes. &ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t bleeding. None of us are bleeding. I won&rsquo;t open this door for anyone but Lord Stark so you better not fetch anyone but him.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Arya!&rdquo; Robb chastised her. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Lord Robb?!&rdquo; The woman exclaimed. </p><p>\t&ldquo;My father NOW!&rdquo; Arya yelled. </p><p>\tThe woman&rsquo;s footsteps scurried off down the hall. </p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not half as scary anymore,&rdquo; Sansa teased. </p><p>\t&ldquo;How old are we anyway?&rdquo; She scowled, plopping down on a cushion beside a dollhouse. &ldquo;When is it?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Before King&rsquo;s Landing, I&rsquo;d wager,&rdquo; Jon said as he rubbed his smooth chin. &ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t have the wolves yet.&rdquo;</p><p>\tLadyLadyLady. Sansa&rsquo;s breath caught. To have her direwolf, to have her fur and fangs and love was too much to ask. It was more than she deserved. Though maybe it was a mercy that Lady had been killed gently in the north. </p><p>The Starks were silent, each contemplating the morning, until someone pounded on the door. </p><p>&ldquo;Robb! Girls! Open this door now!&rdquo;</p><p>Robb hurried to unlatch the lock. He pulled the door back to reveal Ned Stark towering in the doorway. </p></p>",
