I mean, had that been a Jonsa cover I would have been really concerned. It\u2019s almost like a huge hint that J0nerys won\u2019t be endgame at all. Sure, they\u2019re canon for now but endgame??

Winter Coat 2.0 doesn\u2019t look welcoming at all. I mean, I had read this question on Quora on how the other Starks will react to Dany and crew coming to Winterfell. And if she shows up in this, the Wolves will not be all too welcoming to the woman who kept their brother-cousin prisoner. The red seeping through could mean that no matter what, she can\u2019t hold back on her Targaryen insanity. I do see her wearing this when she inevitably threatens to burn some Northern Lords. If J0nerys was truly endgame, I do think she would be in an dark ensemble like the other Starks and to differentiate, she could use some red.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"795\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/013a7d7ffedf2b4dc425736c1baac6aa/tumblr_inline_phizt2gxor1r4dnke_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"795\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"/></figure><p>Something like this, but a fur version.

Dany probably already has a wedding dress commissioned for whatever she believes will happen between her and Jon. I also believe that she has a cloak being made for Jon too. I think she\u2019ll present it to him either before or after his parentage is revealed. Honestly, a small action Jon could do that would solidify his status as a Stark is him choosing Sansa\u2019s cloak instead of Dany\u2019s.

It\u2019s the same one from Season 7. I can\u2019t really say much about it. He\u2019s not wearing the normal Stark jerkins like Ned\u2019s or Robb\u2019s or hell Arya\u2019s. Meaning, he knows at that point that his father is Rhaegar but he still wants to be a Stark.  That is one thing Jon will always want.

I love that Jon and Dany look so much older than their Season 1 versions. They have grown physically and mentally. They\u2019re no longer young and naive. They have been through a lot and that is so visible in their faces. This is Kit and Emilia 8 years older. Makeup and photoshop could have made them look younger, but they didn\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>D&amp;D want us to know that Jon has had enough. He\u2019s pissed. He\u2019s tired. He\u2019s annoyed. In my opinion, he doesn\u2019t look protective of Dany. Had Jon been protective, his eyes would be wide open with different eyebrow positioning. If anything, it looks like it\u2019s the other way around. Emilia is showing a hint of a\u00a0\u201csmize.\u201d As if conveying curiousity, despite knowing the threat of the WWs, there is still much to learn about the North. This promotional photo tries to make them look like an attractive couple to ship, like D&amp;D want you to fall back into the trap so when the twist that Jon and Dany do not end up together, it\u2019ll be more of a shock. But most of the GA find J0nerys as\u00a0\u201cgross\u201d because of the incest. Even people who don\u2019t watch the show know that this is an incestual relationship. (Jonsa is an incestual relationship but les be real, cousin relationships are more accepted in the Westeros)\u00a0</p><p>(I\u2019m getting a little meta here but WC2.0 being white and red could symbolize the ice and fire ultimate cage match. This could mean that Dany sees herself as the sole savior of Westeros. Yes, she needs Jon to help get the North on her side later on but in her mind it\u2019s her dragons and her armies coming to save the North. This whole time, we\u2019ve seen Jon as the one to fight the NK, and Jon sees it that way too. With the loss of Viserion, Dany might see it as her against the NK. Who knows when they\u2019ll find out about him having a dragon.)</p><p>All in all, as a Jonsa stan and a House Stark stan, I am not concerned about this photoshoot at all. They had the first photo together, but Jonsa had the first footage of Season 8 and Jon doesn\u2019t look mad in it at all.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

Meaning, he knows at that point that his father is Rhaegar but he still wants to be a Stark.  That is one thing Jon will always want.

But most of the GA find J0nerys as\u00a0\u201cgross\u201d because of the incest. Even people who don\u2019t watch the show know that this is an incestual relationship.

This could mean that Dany sees herself as the sole savior of Westeros. Yes, she needs Jon to help get the North on her side later on but in her mind it\u2019s her dragons and her armies coming to save the North. This whole time, we\u2019ve seen Jon as the one to fight the NK, and Jon sees it that way too. With the loss of Viserion, Dany might see it as her against the NK. Who knows when they\u2019ll find out about him having a dragon.)</p><p>All in all, as a Jonsa stan and a House Stark stan, I am not concerned about this photoshoot at all.

                "content": "<p><h1>On the new GoT EW cover</h1><p>Looks splendid and I am totally not mad about this J0nerys cover, The costumes as always are incredible. Hats off to Michelle Clapton once again!</p><p>But I do have to wonder why J0nerys fans aren&rsquo;t concerned about ENDGAME being spread over the cover. I mean, had that been a Jonsa cover I would have been really concerned. It&rsquo;s almost like a huge hint that J0nerys won&rsquo;t be endgame at all. Sure, they&rsquo;re canon for now but endgame?? Really? That cover would not have gone through GoT PR without serious consideration for what the GA would think. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> has a great analysis on Dany&rsquo;s costume. Before I go into any criticisms, I do have to say that without context Winter Coat 2.0 is beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>I do have to agree with @trinuviel though, Dany does look like an outsider very much. Winter Coat 2.0 doesn&rsquo;t look welcoming at all. I mean, I had read this question on Quora on how the other Starks will react to Dany and crew coming to Winterfell. And if she shows up in this, the Wolves will not be all too welcoming to the woman who kept their brother-cousin prisoner. The red seeping through could mean that no matter what, she can&rsquo;t hold back on her Targaryen insanity. I do see her wearing this when she inevitably threatens to burn some Northern Lords. If J0nerys was truly endgame, I do think she would be in an dark ensemble like the other Starks and to differentiate, she could use some red.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/013a7d7ffedf2b4dc425736c1baac6aa/tumblr_inline_phizt2gxor1r4dnke_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Something like this, but a fur version. A winter coat version. She would blend in with the North and still be seen as a queen with the overarching belt. But she doesn&rsquo;t. Dany has to stand out, she wants to stand out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that she&rsquo;s coming North with outfits prepared, proves that Sansa will not be making anything for her. Dany probably already has a wedding dress commissioned for whatever she believes will happen between her and Jon. I also believe that she has a cloak being made for Jon too. I think she&rsquo;ll present it to him either before or after his parentage is revealed. Honestly, a small action Jon could do that would solidify his status as a Stark is him choosing Sansa&rsquo;s cloak instead of Dany&rsquo;s.
