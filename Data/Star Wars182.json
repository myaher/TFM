That&rsquo;s literally my biggest ask</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- I would also really like a Ben Solo smile wouldn&rsquo;t that be a lovely thing</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- A major reach but I&rsquo;m still very pro Finn/Poe and I thought it was a really natural progression for their relationship to take but its clear they don&rsquo;t wanna go that way. If not, can we please have more of them hanging out being awesome badasses? </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- If Rey and Ben get to fly the Falcon together then I am 100% done RIP me</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- For God&rsquo;s sake flesh out Rose this time, there was no reason why she couldn&rsquo;t be a good character and Kelly Marie Tran is a sweetheart but they just reduced her to a weepy conflict for Finn come random love interest - it didn&rsquo;t work and I want her to be given some decent writing to work with this time</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- Everything is Lando and nothing hurts</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- I&rsquo;m very pro Rey and Ben going down a more Grey Jedi route (and that seems evident from the themes we&rsquo;ve seen so far) so I&rsquo;m really hoping we&rsquo;ll get to see that rather than a rehash of the Luke + Vader redemption arc where one helps the other and commits an act of sacrifice etc. This also ties heavily into not wanting Ben to die. I&rsquo;m all for redeeming Ben Solo but in a way that a) doesn&rsquo;t involve him dying and b) being a mutual thing where both him and Rey have learned things and come to an understanding about their place in the galaxy and the changes that need to come to future Force users</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- While I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s something I want per se, I&rsquo;m quite heavily buying into this &lsquo;Rey accidentally killing her parents by crashing their ship when they left her&rsquo; theory. However while it is interesting, I think it may complicate the narrative this late in</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- Although saying that, I think we should leave Rey&rsquo;s parentage be for now. Its been done, let&rsquo;s move on</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- ALL OF THE MAZ KANATA</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- Another badass tag-team fight between our favourite force users pls and thank u </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- It&rsquo;s looking likely we&rsquo;ll get it - Force Ghost Luke boiiiii</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- I really enjoyed Hux in the first film but didn&rsquo;t like how he was reduced to a joke in TLJ, I&rsquo;d like to see his petty, sneaky self-servience more in the final chapter</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- I&rsquo;d also like Poe&rsquo;s character to have mellowed out a bit - he&rsquo;s learnt to trust those around him better, calm down his trigger happy nature and be less entitled, so I&rsquo;d like to see this in action now</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- I felt like Finn got shafted a bit in TLJ too - more Finn pls. I&rsquo;d also like some Finn/Rey adventures and teaming up</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- For gads sake let&rsquo;s give Chewie something good this movie he&rsquo;s had such a rough<b> </b>time of it</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- Rey being a badass literally all day every day</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- It won&rsquo;t happen but can u imagine if they played Across the Stars gdjdkshdofjfof (I&rsquo;m not really an Amidala fan - don&rsquo;t get me started - but it&rsquo;s such a beautiful iconic theme)</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- On the musical front, more use of Rey&rsquo;s Theme please! </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- For Leia to get a respectful and meaningful conclusion without jumbling whatever footage they have to make something work</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">- Just imagine folks - imagine if we got an Obi Wan/Ewan McGregor cameo. Just imagine it.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><strike>- Rey and Ben live together happily ever after with a flock of adopted porgs ok by</strike>e </p></p>",
