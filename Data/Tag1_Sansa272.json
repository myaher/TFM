Let&rsquo;s begin. Well, the first one is rather obvious. Baelish runs brothels and has taken part in the murders of a Hand (Arryn) and a King (Joff). He doesn&rsquo;t exactly exuberate lawful and moral behaviour, nor does he respect it.</p><p>His deceitfulness is as plain as day. Baelish is renowned for his lying and manipulation, and revels in it. It&rsquo;s his own personal playground. This also ties into not being able to trust him. At all. This evidenced by his actions and even himself, with that rather iconic line&hellip;</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Distrusting me was the wisest thing you&rsquo;ve done since you climbed off your horse.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\"><b><i>&ldquo;Look around you, we&rsquo;re all liars here, and every one of us is better than you.&rdquo;</i></b></span></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>This third one was a little tricky and I had to do some searching. And as it turns out, Baelish isn&rsquo;t great at planning things. For one, that fight with Brandon Stark - impulsive, brash and planned terribly. Then we have the entire plan to cause a rift between Lannisters and Starks by making a flimsy lie about Tyrion owning the Valyrian Steel dagger. In truth, the only reason his plans &ldquo;worked&rdquo; is because of some luck and a dash of deceit.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;So I challenged him to a duel. I mean, why not? I&rsquo;d read all the stories. The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories. In the end, she wouldn&rsquo;t even let him kill me.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;The first mistake was when he subtly made a jab at Cersei about her unnatural relationship with her brother Jaime, that knowledge is power, which resulted in Cersei nearly having him killed before deciding to remind him of his place.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>The fourth one does not apply to Baelish. He has not shown any aggressiveness.</p><p>This next one definitely applies to him. Baelish blatantly does not care about what happens to others and, arguably, doesn&rsquo;t really have much regard for himself. He doesn&rsquo;t care about the safety of Sansa when he marries her to Ramsay (show) or keeps her in the Vale. He doesn&rsquo;t care about Lysa when he pushes her from the Moon Door. He doesn&rsquo;t care, even, about Cat (he manipulates her without any issue). </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>The next one also somewhat suits Baelish. Sociopaths don&rsquo;t take claim for their wrongdoings and are only responsible in terms of how they deem &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;. Baelish is more than eager to toss the blame of the dagger onto Tyrion in order to wage war between Stark and Lannister. He is more than eager to make everyone believe that Lysa jumped herself. So on and so forth.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that Baelish does not feel any remorse, guilt or empathy. He doesn&rsquo;t seem at all bothered when he throws Lysa or when has a child poisoned or when he marries Sansa to Ramsay (someone known for being cruel). He just doesn&rsquo;t care and doesn&rsquo;t feel bad about it.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Littlefinger is willing to casually dispose of people who trusted him, like a man replacing a coat he no longer needs.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>We all know that Baelish has an obsession with winning &ldquo;the game&rdquo;. He wants power and he wants control. He acts as though everyone else is a chess piece in his game, using them to move spaces and get him ahead. He even says that, at one point&hellip;</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Are you a player or are you a piece?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Whenever I consider a question, I ask myself &lsquo;Will this action make this picture a reality&rsquo;, pull it out of my mind and into the world&hellip;and I only act if the answer is yes.

We don&rsquo;t see a whole lot of genuine emotion coming from him. The one time he shows some full-on &ldquo;emotion&rdquo;, is when he about to be executed. And even then, it feels somehow fake and artificial - he may have been crying and begging because that&rsquo;s what he thought they wanted to see, and what he thought would get him out of the situation.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;He is capable of putting on a seemingly friendly face with a friendly smile - but his eyes don&rsquo;t smile when his mouth does.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>And now&hellip; He&rsquo;s considered a charming and likeable person, somewhat.

Let\u2019s begin. Well, the first one is rather obvious. Baelish runs brothels and has taken part in the murders of a Hand (Arryn) and a King (Joff). He doesn\u2019t exactly exuberate lawful and moral behaviour, nor does he respect it.</p><p>His deceitfulness is as plain as day. Baelish is renowned for his lying and manipulation, and revels in it. It\u2019s his own personal playground. This also ties into not being able to trust him. At all. This evidenced by his actions and even himself, with that rather iconic line\u2026</p><p><i><b>\u201cDistrusting me was the wisest thing you\u2019ve done since you climbed off your horse.\u201d</b></i></p><p><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\"><b><i>\u201cLook around you, we\u2019re all liars here, and every one of us is better than you.\u201d</i></b></span></p><p><i><b>\u201cIs there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?\u201d</b></i></p><p>This third one was a little tricky and I had to do some searching. And as it turns out, Baelish isn\u2019t great at planning things. For one, that fight with Brandon Stark - impulsive, brash and planned terribly. Then we have the entire plan to cause a rift between Lannisters and Starks by making a flimsy lie about Tyrion owning the Valyrian Steel dagger. In truth, the only reason his plans \u201cworked\u201d is because of some luck and a dash of deceit.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSo I challenged him to a duel. I mean, why not? I\u2019d read all the stories.

In the end, she wouldn\u2019t even let him kill me.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cThe first mistake was when he subtly made a jab at Cersei about her unnatural relationship with her brother Jaime, that knowledge is power, which resulted in Cersei nearly having him killed before deciding to remind him of his place.\u201d</b></i></p><p>The fourth one does not apply to Baelish. He has not shown any aggressiveness.</p><p>This next one definitely applies to him. Baelish blatantly does not care about what happens to others and, arguably, doesn\u2019t really have much regard for himself. He doesn\u2019t care about the safety of Sansa when he marries her to Ramsay (show) or keeps her in the Vale. He doesn\u2019t care about Lysa when he pushes her from the Moon Door. He doesn\u2019t care, even, about Cat (he manipulates her without any issue). </p><p><i><b>\u201cWhen you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.\u201d</b></i></p><p>The next one also somewhat suits Baelish. Sociopaths don\u2019t take claim for their wrongdoings and are only responsible in terms of how they deem \u201cresponsibility\u201d. Baelish is more than eager to toss the blame of the dagger onto Tyrion in order to wage war between Stark and Lannister. He is more than eager to make everyone believe that Lysa jumped herself. So on and so forth.</p><p>I think it\u2019s safe to say that Baelish does not feel any remorse, guilt or empathy. He doesn\u2019t seem at all bothered when he throws Lysa or when has a child poisoned or when he marries Sansa to Ramsay (someone known for being cruel). He just doesn\u2019t care and doesn\u2019t feel bad about it.</p><p><i><b>\u201cLittlefinger is willing to casually dispose of people who trusted him, like a man replacing a coat he no longer needs.\u201d</b></i></p><p>We all know that Baelish has an obsession with winning \u201cthe game\u201d. He wants power and he wants control. He acts as though everyone else is a chess piece in his game, using them to move spaces and get him ahead. He even says that, at one point\u2026</p><p><b><i>\u201cAre you a player or are you a piece?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhenever I consider a question, I ask myself \u2018Will this action make this picture a reality\u2019, pull it out of my mind and into the world\u2026and I only act if the answer is yes.

Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but refuse.

The climb is all there is.\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cLittlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army? Perhaps you\u2019ll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.\u201d</i></b></p><p>This next one is something I\u2019m not entirely sure upon. Does he mimic behaviour and emotions? Possibly. We don\u2019t see a whole lot of genuine emotion coming from him. The one time he shows some full-on \u201cemotion\u201d, is when he about to be executed. And even then, it feels somehow fake and artificial - he may have been crying and begging because that\u2019s what he thought they wanted to see, and what he thought would get him out of the situation.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHe is capable of putting on a seemingly friendly face with a friendly smile - but his eyes don\u2019t smile when his mouth does.\u201d</b></i></p><p>And now\u2026 He\u2019s considered a charming and likeable person, somewhat.
