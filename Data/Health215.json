I&rsquo;ve had to force myself to eat (which admittedly was not very successful&hellip;today I only got in like 700 calories), and I couldn&rsquo;t drink a damn thing. Sometimes when I get really down it&rsquo;s hard to care for myself in any way. I don&rsquo;t stress eat, I stress starve (only in this sick world does a fat girl not eat and still be fat). But I got my mile in and I&rsquo;m proud of myself for that.

This program is AMAZING. We received a flier about it in the hospital after Ryder was born and my book-lovin\u2019 heart soared. Dolly Parton\u2019s Imagination Library provides free, high-quality books to children from birth until they begin school. We just received our first book \u2014 The Little Engine That Could \u2014 and I knew the program was something I had to highlight on the blog because I am such a firm believer in the importance of reading to children from a young age.</p>\n<p>One of my friends who is a teacher showed me this <a href=\"http://readdbq.org/2014/11/19/read-20-minutes-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">infographic</a> that I found fascinating and it further reiterated in my mind the importance of reading to kids:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Why-Reading-to-Kids-is-Important.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-84067\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Why-Reading-to-Kids-is-Important-311x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"311\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Why-Reading-to-Kids-is-Important-311x1024.png 311w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Why-Reading-to-Kids-is-Important-91x300.png 91w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Why-Reading-to-Kids-is-Important.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>(Note: The data refers to reading to children for 20 minutes a day once they begin kindergarten but why not start early!?)</em></p>\n<p>Anyway, back to The Imagination Library! The program works by partnering with \u201cLocal Champions\u201d (businesses, schools, large or small organizations or even individuals) who help bring the program to cities, towns and communities around the world.

I had an ad for American Eagle sweaters and thermal tops pop up as I was scrolling through Instagram earlier this week and thought everything looked so darn cute that I was inspired to pop into the store late yesterday morning when I was making a return at a nearby shop. Ryder slept through my fashion show (Chase was at preschool) which worked perfectly because I was able to try on a bunch of different tops and was very impressed with both the flattering fit and the comfort of most things I tried on.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m actually slightly annoyed because when I went to link to the sweaters to share with you guys, I saw that I could\u2019ve saved some money if I would\u2019ve purchased my sweaters online versus in the store (the code FALL4U gets you $20 off purchases $75+, $30 off purchases $100+ and $40 off purchases $150+ online) so keep that in mind if you are hoping to do some shopping before Sunday when the code expires!</p>\n<p>Oh!

                "content": "<p><p>It finally feels like fall in North Carolina! Temperatures hovered in the mid-60s yesterday which felt amazing! We&rsquo;ve had little peeks into cooler temperatures here and there but a glimpse at the 10-day forecast gives me hope that maybe, this time, the crisp fall weather is here to stay!\n</p><p>I have a feeling this weekend will thrust us into full-on fall mode over here because we&rsquo;re hitting the road for Banner Elk, a small mountain town located in the western mountains of North Carolina. I cannot wait to see the changing leaves and explore one of our favorite areas of North Carolina with my family.</p>\n<p>Before I go into vacation mode, I wanted to pop in this morning and share a short roundup of a few things that made me smile this week. Please feel free to chime in and share a few of the things you are loving in the comments section of this post!</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend!</p>\n<h4>Things I&rsquo;m Loving Friday</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>\n<a href=\"https://codewordhats.com/products/704-queen-city-grey-cap\" target=\"_blank\">(Code)Word Hats</a> (The Hat That Gives Back)</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/codeword-hats-704-627x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure my local Charlotte friends will recognize our 704 area code on the hat my friends at (Code)Word sent my way, but the hat I&rsquo;m wearing is about way more than sporting some Queen City pride. (Code)Word was created with a goal of giving back to the community and&nbsp;30% of profits from the sales of their hats go back to&nbsp;the&nbsp;children&rsquo;s&nbsp;hospitals that serve&nbsp;each area code. (You may search for your <a href=\"https://codewordhats.com/collections\" target=\"_blank\">area code here</a>!)</p>\n<p>In Charlotte, this means 30% of the profits from all 704 hats help cover the expenses of vital programs and services that are not reimbursed through insurance at Levine Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Dolly Parton&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://imaginationlibrary.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Imagination Library</a>\n</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1216-823x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Have you guys heard of Dolly Parton&rsquo;s Imagination Library? This program is AMAZING. We received a flier about it in the hospital after Ryder was born and my book-lovin&rsquo; heart soared. Dolly Parton&rsquo;s Imagination Library provides free, high-quality books to children from birth until they begin school. We just received our first book &mdash; The Little Engine That Could &mdash; and I knew the program was something I had to highlight on the blog because I am such a firm believer in the importance of reading to children from a young age.</p>\n<p>One of my friends who is a teacher showed me this <a href=\"http://readdbq.org/2014/11/19/read-20-minutes-day/\" target=\"_blank\">infographic</a> that I found fascinating and it further reiterated in my mind the importance of reading to kids:</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Why-Reading-to-Kids-is-Important-311x1024.png\">External image</div></p>\n<p><em>(Note: The data refers to reading to children for 20 minutes a day once they begin kindergarten but why not start early!?)</em></p>\n<p>Anyway, back to The Imagination Library! The program works by partnering with &ldquo;Local Champions&rdquo; (businesses, schools, large or small organizations or even individuals) who help bring the program to cities, towns and communities around the world. To see if it&rsquo;s available in your area, you may visit the <a href=\"https://imaginationlibrary.com/usa/find-my-program/\" target=\"_blank\">Find My Program</a> page of The Imagination Library website.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>American Eagle Sweaters + Sweatshirts</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1196-1024x683.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><em>(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Oy8JLR\" target=\"_blank\">Plush Hometown Sweatshirt</a>&nbsp;&mdash; available in 8 colors!

It is definitely a weird but cool feeling. Looking at past photos and comparing them to how my body keeps changing is very weird. It&rsquo;s interesting to notice how much extra you have been carrying around and how much has changed without even noticing it. You can&rsquo;t <i>feel </i>that exact moment when<i> </i>your body decides to get rid of that pound of fat. So it&rsquo;s a very weird feeling to look in a mirror and realize &ldquo;wow!&rdquo; I feel like I am in a metamorphosing phase (not just my body but also have been doing deep soul searching) and when I am finally done growing mentally, I can finally spread my wings and fly. </p>",
