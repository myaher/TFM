He was stretched out on the couch, in the small apartment he had in New York for the time he was off the base and nodding through one of his rare free days. He had a lot of sleep to catch up on.</p><p><i>KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.</i></p><p>Slowly, the sound was getting through him. He opened his eyes, taking in the surroundings and easing his mind into a thought that he was off duty, and the persistent sound was not a sound of an alarm, just someone knocking at his door. That someone probably being the pizza delivery, as Rhodey had ordered some food before nodding off. </p><p>&ldquo;Coming, coming!&rdquo; he called, lifting himself up with a grunt before knocking could turn into banging on the wood. He opened the door, seeing a familiar face. &ldquo;Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, honey badger,&rdquo; Tony answered, smiling brightly and holding a pizza box in his hands. &ldquo;Delivery!&rdquo; he announced, making his way into the apartment, not needing an invitation.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Stark Industries is not doing that great and you have to earn cash aside?&rdquo; Rhodey asked with a yawn, closing the door. &ldquo;You could have called me that you plan to come over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did. Your phone has to be on mute. Eat your food before it gets cold,&rdquo; Tony said in his characteristic short sentences, putting the box down on the coffee table.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you get my food&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Saw the delivery boy. I gave him a big tip so he would hand it over to me. People know that I know you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he gave it to you just like that?&rdquo; Rhodey asked, sitting down on the couch.</p><p>Tony laughed. It was a bit strained kind of laugh, not the cheerful one Tony usually had. &ldquo;No one says no to Iron Man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One would think you might run off with the pizza,&rdquo; Rhodey said, opening the box and taking a slice. He chewed on it slowly, trying to be not too obvious with staring at Tony. At the way, his shoulders were lowered, and his head seemed to be dropping down and the deep shadows etched into the skin under his eyes. Seemed that while Rhodey was catching up on sleep, Tony wasn&rsquo;t getting any at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Ew, no,&rdquo; Tony scrunched his nose, eyeing with disgust all the veggies toppling on the pizza slice. &ldquo;Putting broccoli on pizza should be a federal crime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I am guessing you don&rsquo;t want a slice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you are not here to eat my food, why are you here? Not that I am not delighted to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ouch. Don&rsquo;t mind me. I just have some things to work on,&rdquo; Tony said, and just now Rhodey noticed that he had a tablet under his arm this whole time. Tony turned it on and started tapping on it while standing near the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to sit down&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. I always work like this. It&rsquo;s better for my back.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodey finished the pizza slice and reached for another one. Tony was quietly tapping away on the device. Something was off in his friend&rsquo;s behavior, but Rhodey didn&rsquo;t want to ask. For the time being, they quietly enjoyed their company. Seemed that Tony needed it a bit more than he did, but it was fine. It was what friends were for. Just to keep himself occupied, Rhodey turned the TV on and stopped on some random movie, paying attention to the actors on the screen and the slices of food.</p><p>When he was finishing the third slice, Tony sat down on the couch, on the opposite end, still working and trying to be not too evident. </p><p>Half of the pizza was gone and Tony scooted closer to Rhodey, putting his tablet down and watching the movie, still without a word.</p><p>The game of hare and hounds ended, when Tony put his head on Rhodey&rsquo;s shoulder and leaned over his side. Without questioning it, Rhodey raised his arm up and looped over his friend, feeling Tony relaxing and melting. Such position wasn&rsquo;t anything new for them, as Tony, despite his snark and seemingly prickly personality, was a person who enjoyed close contact and needed it. Yet, he somehow always had troubles with executing what he wanted and preferred to gradually get what he needed, instead of properly asking, which Rhodey knew from all the years they had spent together. Rhodey got used to it over with time and didn&rsquo;t try to change it. It was comforting and sleepy for both of them when Tony started talking. </p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm. Rhodey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you\u2026 Can you scratch me for a bit?&rdquo;</p><p>It was a timid request, said in a hushed voice. Rhodey didn&rsquo;t hesitate and started to gently run his fingertips over Tony&rsquo;s shoulder in short motions. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh. Not here. Lower.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; Rhodey asked, moving his hand more to the front.</p><p>&ldquo;Nooo. Lower.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Lower!&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodey tried to not smile at the demanding tone. Tony just couldn&rsquo;t say what he wanted, and Rhodey liked to torment him a bit before indulging him. He moved his hand lower, brushing over the stretched side.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmp. Yeah, here.&rdquo;</p><p>And Rhodey complied, gently moving his finger up and down, barely grazing the material. He felt his friend&rsquo;s breath hitch and heard some small giggles, but the best was feeling Tony&rsquo;s smile pressed into his shoulder. He continued for a while before he had to ask some questions on his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Tones.\u201d</p><p>&quot;Mhhm?&rdquo; Tony hummed, enjoying the light tickle all over his side and back, his eyes closing in a relaxed manner.</p><p>&ldquo;For how long do we know each other?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; Tony answered, his lips twitching into a smile. &ldquo;Thirty years? Man, you are old,&rdquo; he teased with a chuckle.</p><p>Ah, it would be so easy to jab his fingers into the defenseless flank and execute punishment for being a smartass. Rhodey felt that the moment for that would come later. Once they both would get some more rest.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, thirty years. And when will you finally admit that you like being tickled?&rdquo;</p><p>No answer. Which was typical, really. Rhodey continued the sweet brushing over Tony&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;You could start with admitting to being ticklish. That&rsquo;s always a step in a good direction.&rdquo;</p><p>More silence. Rhodey moved his head cautiously, careful to not jostle his friend, and saw that Tony&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and his mouth was slightly opened. Seemed that the closeness, the touch, it all lulled Tony into a well-deserved sleep. </p><p>&ldquo;Sleep well,&rdquo; Rhodey said quietly, kissing his best friend&rsquo;s forehead. Whatever was bothering Tony, they could discuss it once he would get some rest. They had time. </p>",

Seemed that while Rhodey was catching up on sleep, Tony wasn\u2019t getting any at all.</p><p>\u201cEw, no,\u201d Tony scrunched his nose, eyeing with disgust all the veggies toppling on the pizza slice. \u201cPutting broccoli on pizza should be a federal crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I am guessing you don\u2019t want a slice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are not here to eat my food, why are you here? Not that I am not delighted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Don\u2019t mind me. I just have some things to work on,\u201d Tony said, and just now Rhodey noticed that he had a tablet under his arm this whole time. Tony turned it on and started tapping on it while standing near the window.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I always work like this. It\u2019s better for my back.\u201d</p><p>Rhodey finished the pizza slice and reached for another one. Tony was quietly tapping away on the device. Something was off in his friend\u2019s behavior, but Rhodey didn\u2019t want to ask. For the time being, they quietly enjoyed their company. Seemed that Tony needed it a bit more than he did, but it was fine. It was what friends were for. Just to keep himself occupied, Rhodey turned the TV on and stopped on some random movie, paying attention to the actors on the screen and the slices of food.</p><p>When he was finishing the third slice, Tony sat down on the couch, on the opposite end, still working and trying to be not too evident. </p><p>Half of the pizza was gone and Tony scooted closer to Rhodey, putting his tablet down and watching the movie, still without a word.</p><p>The game of hare and hounds ended, when Tony put his head on Rhodey\u2019s shoulder and leaned over his side. Without questioning it, Rhodey raised his arm up and looped over his friend, feeling Tony relaxing and melting. Such position wasn\u2019t anything new for them, as Tony, despite his snark and seemingly prickly personality, was a person who enjoyed close contact and needed it. Yet, he somehow always had troubles with executing what he wanted and preferred to gradually get what he needed, instead of properly asking, which Rhodey knew from all the years they had spent together. Rhodey got used to it over with time and didn\u2019t try to change it. It was comforting and sleepy for both of them when Tony started talking. </p><p>\u201cMmmm. Rhodey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2026 Can you scratch me for a bit?\u201d</p><p>It was a timid request, said in a hushed voice. Rhodey didn\u2019t hesitate and started to gently run his fingertips over Tony\u2019s shoulder in short motions. </p><p>\u201cUh. Not here. Lower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Rhodey asked, moving his hand more to the front.</p><p>\u201cNooo. Lower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Lower!\u201d</p><p>Rhodey tried to not smile at the demanding tone. Tony just couldn\u2019t say what he wanted, and Rhodey liked to torment him a bit before indulging him. He moved his hand lower, brushing over the stretched side.</p><p>\u201cHmp. Yeah, here.\u201d</p><p>And Rhodey complied, gently moving his finger up and down, barely grazing the material. He felt his friend\u2019s breath hitch and heard some small giggles, but the best was feeling Tony\u2019s smile pressed into his shoulder. He continued for a while before he had to ask some questions on his own.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tones.\u201d</p><p>\"Mhhm?\u201d Tony hummed, enjoying the light tickle all over his side and back, his eyes closing in a relaxed manner.</p><p>\u201cFor how long do we know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Tony answered, his lips twitching into a smile. \u201cThirty years? Man, you are old,\u201d he teased with a chuckle.</p><p>Ah, it would be so easy to jab his fingers into the defenseless flank and execute punishment for being a smartass. Rhodey felt that the moment for that would come later. Once they both would get some more rest.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thirty years. And when will you finally admit that you like being tickled?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Which was typical, really. Rhodey continued the sweet brushing over Tony\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou could start with admitting to being ticklish. That\u2019s always a step in a good direction.\u201d</p><p>More silence. Rhodey moved his head cautiously, careful to not jostle his friend, and saw that Tony\u2019s eyes were closed, and his mouth was slightly opened. Seemed that the closeness, the touch, it all lulled Tony into a well-deserved sleep. </p><p>\u201cSleep well,\u201d Rhodey said quietly, kissing his best friend\u2019s forehead. Whatever was bothering Tony, they could discuss it once he would get some rest. They had time. </p>",

Your phone has to be on mute.

People know that I know you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he gave it to you just like that?&rdquo; Rhodey asked, sitting down on the couch.</p><p>Tony laughed.

Sorry if it\u2019s a little short but I hope you\u2019ll enjoy it.<br/>\nRemember, request are always open!<br/>\n**</p>\n\n<p>That Sunday I was so tired I could easily sleep for another week. Why?

Wow, it was only 8 of the morning and he looked like he was going to run a marathon. \u201cPage 5, first prayer-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSteve, sorry if I may interrupt this-\u201d Tony looked at all of us. \u201c-satanic thing, but what we\u2019re praying for exactly?\u201d He asked and Cap narrowed his eyebrows.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTony, this is all but not satanic and we\u2019re praying for God!\u201d He answered. </p>\n\n<p><br/>\n\u201cWell, we have God here.\u201d Tony pointed at Thor that was trying to understand some words of a prayer and I laughed a little. \u201cWe can thank him and then go to eat?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, Tony. This is a serious thing.\u201d Steve closed his eyes and snorted a little.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, I woke up just to eat something. Why the hell do I have to pray? I can pay someone to pray for me!\u201d He replied and my smiled became bigger.

You\u2019re still a villain, but it helps! It helps your spirit!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a billionaire, I don\u2019t need a spirit.\u201d Tony gave me his book of prayers. \u201cYou know what?
