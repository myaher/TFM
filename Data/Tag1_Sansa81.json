Although Jon didn&rsquo;t literally kill Ramsay, he almost did. &nbsp;An alternative explanation may have something to do with Bronn&rsquo;s actions in season 8, as Jerome Flynn (the actor who plays him) has hinted that Bronn may take a darker turn. &nbsp;If Bronn allies with Cersei for some reason, maybe he will be implicated in a plot involving Sansa.</p><hr /><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58832f356fde6a178315e6150a8297a1/tumblr_inline_ppo12sa6Dz1wx65bx_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It seems clear that if this song does indeed provide a veiled reference to the ending of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, the &ldquo;Dornishman&rdquo; would have to be &nbsp;Jon Snow. &nbsp;The Dornishman&rsquo;s &ldquo;wife&rdquo; is a more difficult reference; however in the very episode in which the song is featured, Sansa is shown taking a bath and talking about the Starks and Winterfell. &nbsp;Interestingly, in this same episode (before he makes his remark about the&nbsp;&ldquo;ending), Bronn sings only the first half of the song. &nbsp;The end of the song is sung by him in another episode,&nbsp;<i>The Gift.</i></p>",

        "body": "<p>I have\nalways seen people discuss whether Sansa is a Ravenclaw or a Slytherin, but I\nsee her as a Hufflepuff, to be honest. Before murdering me, let me defend my\nidea ^^ According to Wikia, here are the Hufflepuff attributes: <i>dedication, hardworking, fairness, patience, kindness,\ntolerance, modesty and loyalty</i>. Let us proceed attribute by attribute.<br/></p><h2>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDedication.</h2><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sansa\nembodies dedication. She worked hard to become a perfect lady (see 2.), she\nwants to be the perfect wife for Joffrey and a good queen, she looks after\nSweet Robin even though he needs a lot of attention (due to his seizures and\nmany problems, poor kid) and acts like the Lady of the Erye even though it\ndemands a lot of work, etc.</p><h2>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHardworking</h2><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0According to her own mother, \u201cSansa\nwas a lady at three\u201d. Even though Sansa was obviously a natural when it came to\nbe a lady, she had to work to be as good as she is. She can play several\ninstruments, write poetry, sew her own clothes (and lady clothes are harder to\ndo than low-born clothes because embroidery is hard), but she also is a walking\nencyclopaedia when she is 11, which shows that she worked hard to remember\nHouses, knights, etc. You have to work hard to know how to do these things as\nwell as Sansa does, which means than she is a hard worker.</p><h2>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFairness</h2><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I do not think that this attribute\nhas much development. I do not remember her being unfair, to be honest, but I\ncan be wrong. And no, her treatment of Jon is not unfair simply because they\ndid not interact. Jon and Sansa have no common interest, and her ignoring him\nis not \u201cunfair\u201d. Sansa obeys the rules of society, but still remains kind. It\nwould have been so easy for her to be unfair! She could accuse him of any\nwrongdoings she wanted, and people would have believed her. And, by the way,\nevery single Stark kid calls Jon \u201cmy bastard half-brother\u201d or \u201cmy\nhalf-brother\u201d. Her treatment of Jon is the only moment when we could see Sansa\nbeing unfair, but she was not. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When you look at Westerosi culture,\nshe was not being unfair to him.

She can play several\ninstruments, write poetry, sew her own clothes (and lady clothes are harder to\ndo than low-born clothes because embroidery is hard), but she also is a walking\nencyclopaedia when she is 11, which shows that she worked hard to remember\nHouses, knights, etc. You have to work hard to know how to do these things as\nwell as Sansa does, which means than she is a hard worker.</p><h2>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFairness</h2><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I do not think that this attribute\nhas much development.

And, by the way,\nevery single Stark kid calls Jon \u201cmy bastard half-brother\u201d or \u201cmy\nhalf-brother\u201d.

But she was patient: she waited for Robb to come and\nsave her, for Dontos&rsquo; plan, etc. In comparison, Arya is quite impatient (this\nis not an attack, simply a comparison to show Sansa&rsquo;s patience!), as\nseen when she tries to escape the men of the Brotherhood Without Banner when\nthey capture her, for example.</p><h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nKindness</h2><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am not sure that I have to prove\nSansa&rsquo;s kindness: she saves Dontos, covers Arya, cares for Sweet Robin, she\nwould have given bread to the angry mob if she had any, etc. Sansa is kind,\nthere is nothing you can say which will make me think otherwise.</p><h2>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTolerance</h2><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa is someone I see as quite\ntolerant through her religious background: even though she prefers the Faith of\nthe Seven, she also believes in the Old Gods, and goes to the weird wood. It\ndemonstrates that she is open-minded, even though we do not have much info on\nthis subject and thus I cannot really say anything. We can also note that she\ndoes not think ill of Ellaria Sand, who is a bastard and, even though we see the\nscene through Tyrion&rsquo;s eyes, it would have been easy to write as being uneasy\nwhen talking to Ellaria (for example, Ollena called Ellaria a &ldquo;whore&rdquo;). Thus, I\nthink Sansa is pretty tolerant considering Westerosi standards.</p><h2>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nModesty</h2><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Correct me if I am wrong, but I do\nnot remember Sansa bragging. She says that she is stupid and silly (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just\nbeing silly&rdquo;) and never seems arrogant. Even Arya, who used to have a very\nbiased description of her sister due to her self-confidence issues, does not\nsee her as arrogant.</p><h2>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nLoyalty</h2><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No matter what, Sansa remained loyal\nto her House. Each time Robb won a battle, Sansa bled for the North. She was\nbeaten and humiliated for Joffrey&rsquo;s pleasure, but she remained loyal to her\nhouse. She wanted to raise her sons to hate the Lannisters because she is loyal\nto the Starks and wants nothing but going home. It is <i>literally</i> the first thing she asked to Cersei when she was freed\nfrom her betrothal to Joffrey. Sansa wants to go home.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, I think Sansa is\nsomeone who would perfectly fit in Hufflepuff. Is she brave, cunning, etc? Of\ncourse; everyone fits in several Hogwart House. However, you are sorted in a\nHouse whose attributes corresponds to those you value the most! And Sansa does\nnot value her Slytherin (resourcefulness, self-preservation, cleverness, etc) or\nRavenclaw (Intelligence, wit, wisdom) abilities above what comes naturally to\nher: dedication, hardworking, fairness, patience, kindness, tolerance, modesty\nand loyalty.</p><p>(And yes, I\nwanted to sort my favourite in my House but I think I have some pretty valid\narguments, don&rsquo;t I?)</p>",

Anon, you simpleton, my point was that maybe be more intersectional with your feminism which is apparently far beyond your capabilities. Yes, anon, feminine behaviour is taught just like masculine behaviour is taught because we live in a society and that involves socialisation. You can take a break after every sentence because I can tell it\u2019s really difficult for you to follow along. Yes, anon, women are oppressed everywhere including Nigeria which you have definitely been to. Yes, the patriarchy has destroyed the bodies and lives of women. I have not disputed any of this, you just came here to be angry. The way you, a Nigerian/America or wherever you\u2019re actually from, react to characters on TV isn\u2019t the same as me. I\u2019m not worried about lipstick on Carol Danvers so much as colorism because lipstick isn\u2019t as prevalent in my society. So characters you think are over-represented or whatever aren\u2019t imo. Saying that all feminine characters aren\u2019t groundbreaking is untrue for <b>female characters belonging to marginalised groups.</b></p><p>My issue is that you are all focusing your anger on feminine women instead of the patriarchy to the point of lying about them being held up as ideals in Game of Thrones and other shows (my favourite part of your ask is your claim that Sansa is held up as ideal in GOT lmao). Which is it anon, are feminine women devalued or are they idealised? It can\u2019t be both because femininity is tied to womanhood (which yes isn\u2019t a single thing, is fluid, a spectrum etc etc) and women are looked down on everywhere. You can take another break, I know your brain is hurting from having to read so much. The problem with posts like that is it wasn\u2019t telling the reality of women the world over which was my point, the sexism I live through is affected by colonialism, islamophobia, ethnophobia etc. Also the usual arguments of destructive beauty standards like fighting in heels or inappropriate clothing aren\u2019t present in Sansa which was <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWn-sy8EQh3ySq6yjaxU6FA\" target=\"_blank\">@cmollyo</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnmFxmxX7-5LLVmw6a5ATxw\" target=\"_blank\">@cleverjonquil</a>\u2018s point.

Saying that all feminine characters aren&rsquo;t groundbreaking is untrue for <b>female characters belonging to marginalised groups.</b></p><p>My issue is that you are all focusing your anger on feminine women instead of the patriarchy to the point of lying about them being held up as ideals in Game of Thrones and other shows (my favourite part of your ask is your claim that Sansa is held up as ideal in GOT lmao). Which is it anon, are feminine women devalued or are they idealised? It can&rsquo;t be both because femininity is tied to womanhood (which yes isn&rsquo;t a single thing, is fluid, a spectrum etc etc) and women are looked down on everywhere. You can take another break, I know your brain is hurting from having to read so much. The problem with posts like that is it wasn&rsquo;t telling the reality of women the world over which was my point, the sexism I live through is affected by colonialism, islamophobia, ethnophobia etc. Also the usual arguments of destructive beauty standards like fighting in heels or inappropriate clothing aren&rsquo;t present in Sansa which was <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWn-sy8EQh3ySq6yjaxU6FA\" target=\"_blank\">@cmollyo</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnmFxmxX7-5LLVmw6a5ATxw\" target=\"_blank\">@cleverjonquil</a>&lsquo;s point. That&rsquo;s why they said&nbsp;&lsquo;Sansa begs to defer.&rsquo; Whatever OP and others were complaining about <b>can&rsquo;t be applied to every female character.</b></p><p>My favourite thing about this anon is them getting mad because I don&rsquo;t think feminine women should get attacked, that femininity isn&rsquo;t celebrated and I think Sansa is a groundbreaking character on TV. How many Sansas in fantasy series do you&nbsp;know anon who supposedly likes many feminine characters on TV?</p></p>",

Dany giving in to her dragon side and Tyrion becoming even more nihilistic than he was in ADWD.  I also think that the Starks (including Jon Snow) will take darker paths in TWOW.  I believe the danger they face is that they will let the cold in and all the horrors that they have suffered will cause them to become more callous 1/2",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>\nI love Dany, Tyrion and all the Starks and it will be interesting to see\n them grapple with and defeat their own inner monsters and I have every \nconfidence that they will. \u00a0Jon has become Lord Snow, where he forced \nGilly to swap her baby and Sansa, Arya and Bran are being mentored by \npeople who don\u2019t seem the sort to encourage things like compassion and \nempathy in their protogees. \u00a0Can you say what the dark paths might be \nfor Sansa, Arya and Bran? 2/2 <br/></p></blockquote><p>I would not put it as them grappling with their inner monster because monster is a loaded term that\u2019s been used particularly with Tyrion to denote an inherent moral rot which <a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/179565390995/when-i-commented-that-you-seemed-a-poor-sort-of\" target=\"_blank\">largely feeds into Tyrion\u2019s breakdown and spiral in ADWD because\u00a0\u201cyou make me sorry that I am not the monster you would have me be\u201d</a>. An expectation of monstrosity as an unchangeable trait of Tyrion\u2019s broke him down to a point that set him on the dark path he is currently on.

They are all already on their way there to varying extents but the slide is perhaps clearer in some stories than others.

Skinchanging a human has been established as an abomination and a pretty terrible thing to do that it\u2019s been described as akin to rape. Thistle brutalizes herself in her resistance to Varamyr\u2019s violation of her mind, and Hodor is always quietly terrified of Bran\u2019s intrusion that he retreats into his own mind. Yet Bran keeps skinchanging Hodor and using his body to do what he wants disregarding Hodor\u2019s agency, consent, bodily autonomy and abject fear and hatred of what Bran is forcing on him, which will come to head with the incident of \u201chold the door\u201d when Bran forces Hodor to sacrifice himself for Bran\u2019s and Meera\u2019s survival. That repeated violation of Hodor\u2019s personhood and autonomy is informed by a great deal of ableism on Bran\u2019s part since he stops treating Hodor as a person and instead turns him into a means to an end, a meat suit to ride and give back when he is done. But Hodor\u2019s body isn\u2019t Bran\u2019s to use and ultimately Bran has to recognize that he has monumentally violated a person, a loyal friend who has been instrumental in Bran\u2019s journey no less, to his grave largely because he dismissed Hodor\u2019s personhood due to his disability.</p><p>\nArya\u2019s darker path will probably have to do with the possibility of her giving into \nvengeance.

While most of Arya\u2019s kills have \nfallen on the justice side, she has killed on the kindly man\u2019s orders, \nand she is set for a confrontation with the Faceless Men over her \nunlicensed kill of Raff the Sweetling that might push her to focus on \nher list as she fully reclaims the identity of Arya Stark.

It is a \nreturn to \u201cJoffrey was dead, but if Robb was dead too, what did it \nmatter?\u201d that will shift Arya\u2019s path back to seeking out her siblings \nrather than trying to cross names off her list.\n\n<br/></p><p>Sansa\u2019s arc will probably revolve around a question of complicity. Littlefinger has put a lot of effort into making Sansa his accomplice. He made her a part of Joffrey\u2019s murder without her knowledge but then shifted to making her a conscious accomplice in his schemes by involving her in the coverup of Lysa\u2019s murder and framing Marillion. And despite the fact that Sansa hasn\u2019t put it together yet, Littlefinger is fairly open about a few of his more nefarious plans with her. But she does have the necessary information to eventually deduce that he is the one behind Jon Arryn\u2019s murder and that he is currently slowly poisoning Robert Arryn. I think Sansa reaches a point where she realizes the more egregious of Petyr\u2019s crimes and faces the choice of keeping her silence or exposing him. I suspect that learning about Petyr\u2019s betrayal of Ned and/or what he did to Jeyne Poole might be the tipping point in her arc.<br/></p>",

I think Arya \nreturns to Westeros with the express goal of finishing off those on her \nlist as the fine line between vengeance and justice gets really blurred.\n Meeting Lady Stoneheart and BwB will be the culmination of that arc in \nthat it demonstrates the possible perils of having vengeance as a goal, \nhow easy it is for justice and vengeance to get conflated, and how \nkilling the people on her list won&rsquo;t make her feel better. It is a \nreturn to &ldquo;Joffrey was dead, but if Robb was dead too, what did it \nmatter?&rdquo; that will shift Arya&rsquo;s path back to seeking out her siblings \nrather than trying to cross names off her list.\n\n<br /></p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s arc will probably revolve around a question of complicity. Littlefinger has put a lot of effort into making Sansa his accomplice. He made her a part of Joffrey&rsquo;s murder without her knowledge but then shifted to making her a conscious accomplice in his schemes by involving her in the coverup of Lysa&rsquo;s murder and framing Marillion. And despite the fact that Sansa hasn&rsquo;t put it together yet, Littlefinger is fairly open about a few of his more nefarious plans with her. But she does have the necessary information to eventually deduce that he is the one behind Jon Arryn&rsquo;s murder and that he is currently slowly poisoning Robert Arryn. I think Sansa reaches a point where she realizes the more egregious of Petyr&rsquo;s crimes and faces the choice of keeping her silence or exposing him. I suspect that learning about Petyr&rsquo;s betrayal of Ned and/or what he did to Jeyne Poole might be the tipping point in her arc.<br /></p></p>",
