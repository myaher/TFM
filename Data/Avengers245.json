Soldiers, fighters, all of them trying to reach out for comfort one last time, scrambling to hold on to anything, as if that could have saved them. A second time, something snapped, and you watched yourself fall to pieces. Not in the way you hoped and prayed. There was no relief, no disintegration, it was the ugly kind.

A terribly ugly, sharp word. The stone, himself, both interchangeable. No one would say his name in front of you, never placed him within their sentences, careful, watchful of you. Destroy, annihilate, obliterate, eliminate, eradicate, exterminate. Words painted in red, wrapped in barbed wire. You didn\u2019t want any of them to be associated with him, your love.</p><p>They made a promise. Steve, Shuri, Vision, all of them. You made them promise they would do everything before giving up. Giving up didn\u2019t mean what it usually did. Stepping back, doing nothing, watching the world burn before you. No, that meant something else. It meant destroy. Take out the stone, leave him a shell of himself. Empty. An object. Only then, was it acceptable.</p><p>Neither of you asked about this. Death was a sore subject, an avoidance despite your line of work. You knew plenty of dead people. Gone too soon, taken so painfully, suffered through every last breath. A nagging idea in the back of your mind. You knew it was there, it always would be. He had questions, in need of understanding the concept as a whole, but never were specifics mentioned. It wasn\u2019t something you wanted to waste your words with, instead focusing on brighter, trivial, domestic things. Laundry, groceries, nothing of importance. </p><p>Now you wished you had. Not into depth, but something he would have wanted, something you wanted, a dark feeling growing in your gut. Wakanda would be open to the rest of the world. An army would be let in, and you weren\u2019t entirely sure you could face them, not alone, not without him. </p><p>Vision always said you worried too much. He feared one day it would get to you, after so many restless nights, so many abysses you\u2019d caught yourself spiraling into one thought at a time. Turns out, you\u2019d been right all along. This terrible thing eating away at you from the second you stepped away from him, it was right. You weren\u2019t there to see it for yourself, but you felt it. It struck a nerve, something that held you together because when it happened you completely fell apart. They hadn\u2019t given up, but Thanos had, taking what was not rightfully his, turning the only person you truly loved into lifeless grey remains. It wasn\u2019t long after the people around you began to dissapear. Soldiers, fighters, all of them trying to reach out for comfort one last time, scrambling to hold on to anything, as if that could have saved them. A second time, something snapped, and you watched yourself fall to pieces. Not in the way you hoped and prayed. There was no relief, no disintegration, it was the ugly kind. Steve found you hiding, shaking, thanking some cruel god you were still alive. He didn\u2019t have to say it, because you already knew.</p></p>",

They are on a mission and I&rsquo;m in the helicopter; back-up.</p><p>&ldquo;Answer it please, oh and call me Morgan, please.&rdquo; No matter how many times I tell it to call me Morgan it just doesn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Hello dad. Need me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, M. Yeah we do; we have an enhanced.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;Give me two seconds, I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p><p>I run into the field and see Clint on the ground, shot, with Nat next to him. &ldquo;Do I need to bring your ass back to the copter or do I get the ass hat that did this to you?&quot;I ask him.</p><p>&quot;Get him. Oh and by the way he has super speed and said &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t see that coming?&rsquo; so use that when you get him.&rdquo; Says Clint. I smile and say &ldquo;Will do, Old Man!&rdquo; I then run off not wanting to hear him lie saying he&rsquo;s not old when he is. I run around until I see the enhanced.</p><p><i>Okay so best course of action is probably to run into him. </i>So of course that&rsquo;s what I do. I run into him at full speed making him fall to the ground on his back but I was ready; I just stand firm.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see that coming?&rdquo; I ask him as he&rsquo;s on the ground. &ldquo;Kay, got speedy. What should I do with him?&rdquo; I ask over the intercoms that I couldn&rsquo;t hear while running. No one answers. <i>Of course you don&rsquo;t answer the girl with the super human, that makes total sense to me&hellip;</i></p><p>Speedy gets up but I quickly grab his wrist so he can&rsquo;t run. He looks at me and I give him a smile. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Morgan. Since my fantastic team members aren&rsquo;t answering I&rsquo;ll be with you for a while; better get used to me.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t respond, but he does look at me and I get to study his features a little. &ldquo;Wait, it&rsquo;s you. Where&rsquo;s your sister?&rdquo; I look at him concerned. <i>What if we didn&rsquo;t get here in time to save her!?</i></p><p>&ldquo;How do you know me or my sister?&rdquo; He asks, he has an accent.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I see things and you and your sister, I&rsquo;ve been seeing you two a lot. Listen, I&rsquo;m like you. I&rsquo;ve been experimented on, it&rsquo;s how I got my powers; same with Steve; so I know what it&rsquo;s like. We don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, we want to put the guys who did this to you in jail; we don&rsquo;t even want to hurt them, but if we have to to get them behind bars then we are gonna. But, we don&rsquo;t want to hurt you so please don&rsquo;t hurt us. These guys are my family, they&rsquo;re all I got so please don&rsquo;t hurt them; you wouldn&rsquo;t like t if your sister got hurt and I don&rsquo;t like it when my family gets hurt either.&rdquo; He has a small smile on his face but it soon disappears. &ldquo;How do I know you aren&rsquo;t lying?&rdquo; He asks. &ldquo;Well, for starters, your sisters name is Wanda, I believe. Your&rsquo;s is Pietro. You have super speed she has telekinetic powers. Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>Before he can answer I sense something. <i>He&rsquo;s in trouble!</i> I let go of Pietro and run to dad. When I do get there he&rsquo;s at the scepter but he seems to be in a trance, with Wanda behind him; she&rsquo;s doing it.</p><p>&ldquo;Not cool.&rdquo; I say in her direction. &ldquo;Dad?&rdquo; No response. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;<i> I&rsquo;m skipping all this stuff.</i> I slap him, but not too hard; it might still leave a bruise. He snaps out of it and grabs the scepter then leaves.</p><p>I huff a little. <i>Wow, you&rsquo;re welcome</i>. &ldquo;Wow, that was real cool,&rdquo; I say sarcastically to Wanda who now has Pietro next to her. I wait or dramatic effect. &ldquo;Wanda.&rdquo; I then speed out of that creepy place.</p><p>I get to the aircraft before dad. &ldquo;Hello, everybody!&rdquo; I smile at everyone. Before they can even ask I inform them. &ldquo;Dad got the scepter, but the girl used her powers on him so&hellip; yeah. Oh and the boys name is Pietro, he has super speed, and the girls name is Wanda, she has telekinetic powers. Pietro seems decent but Wanda I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of, for obvious reasons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.&rdquo; Nat says after she gets Bruce&rsquo;s attention off of his opera music.</p><p>&ldquo;Just wasn&rsquo;t expecting the Code Green.&rdquo; He says a little frazzled. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been there, there would&rsquo;ve been double the casualties. My best friend would&rsquo;ve been a treasured memory.&rdquo; She says talking about Clint. &ldquo;You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn&rsquo;t exactly what I want to hear.&rdquo; &ldquo;How long before you trust me?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>They keep talking but it&rsquo;s all very boring so I put on my headphones and listen to some music; mostly musicals and some rock here and there. I pull out my <b><i>Kindle</i></b> and continue reading <b><i>Everything, Everything</i></b> by Nicola Yoon.</p><p>I look up and everyone is leaving the plane.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, thanks for telling me we landed.&rdquo; I remarked sarcastically, but no one even looks at me. That was a pretty good remark.</p><p>I get out of the aircraft and go into the tower to makes some tea and read a good book.</p><p>~~During the battle~~</p><p>I sit on the aircraft like I always do during the fun battles. I wait for everyone to come back from the fight with Ultron. Well that&rsquo;s before I get a vision of Clint shielding a child and then the sound of gun shots.</p><p>I look up and see people getting on; civilians. I run out and start looking for the place I saw from the vision.</p><p>As I the sight gets into view I hear a gun shot. My hand shoots up and I hope something would happen. I close my eyes tightly and hope something protected Clint and the child; I hope something shields them from the bullets. I feel something I can&rsquo;t really describe at that time. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t look till somebody puts a hand on my shoulder. <i>Please be a good guy. Please be a good guy. </i>I look behind me and see the Archer. I sigh in relief that he and the child are alright.</p><p>I flood him with a million questions. &ldquo;What happened? Are you alright? Did you get hurt? Where&rsquo;s the kid? Are they okay?&rdquo; He waits for me to stop. When I finally do he replies &ldquo;A shield type thing saved me and Pietro; he was gonna take the bullets and if you had been a millisecond later he&rsquo;d be all hole-y. I&rsquo;m fine. No I didn&rsquo;t get hurt, well from that. The kid went back to his mother. And he&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; I look at him shocked. &ldquo;How do you know it was me with the shield?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well you still find new powers so I guessed&hellip;&rdquo; I look down at my hand and see a blue-green mist coming from it.</p><p>Speedster then basically appears in front of me. &ldquo;You are okay?&rdquo; He asks like I could have gotten hurt when I was probably a good few feet away. &ldquo;I mean yeah, I felt&hellip; something. But yeah I&rsquo;m fine. Nothing injured, from that at least.&rdquo; I chuckle nervously trying to lighten the tension.</p><p>That of course didn&rsquo;t work. Both the boys still seemed worried and amazed. &ldquo;Well, we should get back.&rdquo; I tell them but this is the first time I looked at Pietro for more then a millisecond. &ldquo;You- you have a- a bullet hole!&rdquo; I exclaim.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, um, yes. But it will not hurt for long.&rdquo; He tries to calm me which worked as well as me trying to calm him. &ldquo;That means it hurts. Go with Clint, don&rsquo;t get in trouble and find everyone else. I&rsquo;ll do a quick look over of the place,&rdquo; I look at both the boys and say this but then look only at Pietro &ldquo;And get that fixed up; wouldn&rsquo;t want you hole-y.&rdquo; I try and joke.</p><p>Before Clint can complain about me stealing his joke I run off to do a check of the area. I find Wanda with several 'dead&rsquo; robot things around her (Ultron&rsquo;s team). She&rsquo;s sobbing like part of her died.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; I say carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Pietro, he&rsquo;s hurt or dead!&rdquo; She says between sobs, whimpers and shaky breath. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dead! Don&rsquo;t worry he&rsquo;ll be fine. Just one bullet hit him, I saw him and the wound myself. He was gonna die to protect a child and Clint.&rdquo; I explain to her. &ldquo;How- who- Why?!&rdquo; She says not knowing exactly what to ask first. &ldquo;It was with a machine gun, Ultron or one of his goons and because he&rsquo;s on the other team?&rdquo; I say more of a question. &ldquo;If it was in fact a machine gun, how is he not dead?&rdquo; She questions seeming happy yet curious. &ldquo;Well, um, I have these power, I guess, that just kinda pop up. I shielded him and Clint, or at least that&rsquo;s what Clint says is what happened.&rdquo; I try to play it cool; probably failing miserably.</p><p>She looks at me then walks up to me and hugs me. I hug her back rather awkwardly due to me not really knowing her or being a touchy-feely kind of person. She pulls away and says &ldquo;Thank you, He is the only one I have left.&rdquo; I smile at her then say &ldquo;Well, yes and no. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you and your brother are Avengers now, so you have me and the team now. Trust me, the team will treat you like family; they always have with me at least, and I&rsquo;m sure you two will be no different.&rdquo; \u00a0I smile at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, we have to get back to leave this place ASAP!&rdquo; I tell her. She takes off flying (only a few inches off the ground) towards the aircraft. I soon follow suit but running instead of flying. But before we can even get there I feel as though my heart was ripped out in front of me and squeezed till every drop and ounce of blood has dripped out; and then it was forced back into my empty cavity of a chest.</p><p>I fall to my knees and quiver;not being able to to breathe. I know who it is that made me feel this way and why.</p><p>&ldquo;Pietro&hellip;&rdquo; Is all I can think to say. I look over to see Wanda on her knees doing the same a me. It seems we both know that something horrible happened to him.<i> I wasn&rsquo;t there to save him this time; I failed him, I might as well have killed him myself.</i></p><p>I put my hand on Wanda&rsquo;s shoulder to try and comfort her. Before I even know it she&rsquo;s hugging me and I her. I cry and walk back to the aircraft with Wanda right next to me; we don&rsquo;t need to say anything for her to know that we both loved him (yes, in different ways but still love and such).</p><p>We finally get back to everyone else, but before they can even ask me any questions I put my headphones on and close my eyes and listen to <b>'Not About Angels&rsquo; </b>by <b>Birdy</b>&hellip; for the whole time to get to the tower&hellip; which probably isn&rsquo;t the best thing to do right now but I honestly couldn&rsquo;t care less at this point.</p><p>No one talked, they just looked at Wanda sympathetically and at me with confusion and sadness in their eyes. No one knew I liked him, I barely knew I liked him; but now I know that I loved him. Well at least that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m guessing this newly found emotion is.</p><p>We land, I&rsquo;m the first one out and immediately go to my room. I keep my headphones and close the door, not even bothering to lock it, then flop on my bed. I have no tears to cry but it&rsquo;s like I can&rsquo;t feel anything but so much regret.</p><p><i>I ignored him, he tried to talk to me in the tower and I ignored him. How could I have done that? I only did that because he hurt my family and he said sorry god knows how many times. I denied my feelings and tried to make myself believe that I didn&rsquo;t like him. Now I can&rsquo;t even tell him, now he&rsquo;s gone and it&rsquo;s all my fault. I should have helped and saved him somehow. I should have been the one to die, it shouldn&rsquo;t have been him.</i></p><p>I stay in my room for weeks only ever coming out for meals or to go to the bathroom. I&rsquo;m not doing the one thing I would have killed to do at one point, fighting the bad guy; helping anyway I could. Everyone has come in a saw me; Steve, Clint, Nat, Bruce, everyone. My dad is trying his best but I can&rsquo;t get over this, I miss him so much. They are keeping his body in the lab, I have no clue as to why but they are.</p><p>At first my mind loved to play tricks on me; show me visions of him waking up or coming to see me or smile and eating in the kitchen with everyone. I would believe that he would wake up, but it never happened, he never woke up.</p><p>Then I went to the anger stage of grief and went to the gym and training room; I would punch anything I could, I would kick robot ass and I would work my ass off pushing myself to just destroy something. I would get irritated very easily. During this time we got a new member his name is Bucky or Buck or whatever stupid nickname Dad gave him.</p><p>I soon got to the bargaining stage. During this I would talk into the obis just hoping that there was a god or something that was able to bring him back or just let me see him one last time. At one point I asked Thor if he could do something, but he couldn&rsquo;t. I asked if there was a way for me to go back to that day, for me to die instead; still nothing. During this the Avengers fought, got two new member who&rsquo;s names are Peter or spider man or Spidey, and Bucky, or Buck, or the Winter Shoulder. then made up to fight a big baddie whom killed people I never met ( Drax, Wong and a Raccoon thing I think his name was Rocket).</p><p>So here I am, fighting my own battle with depression. But I&rsquo;ve gotten really good at pretending that I&rsquo;m fine and I&rsquo;ve gotten over it. Some people see through it (Stephen Strange, Wanda, Loki, Buck and Peter Quill). I&rsquo;ve gotten decently close with all the new guys, they all seem pretty decent and like an extended family. Wanda has gotten really close with Vision and they are even dating, which I&rsquo;m in full support of!</p><p>The people who see through my act have tried to help and all that but as much as they try I still am having trouble accepting the fact that I will never get Pietro back, that I&rsquo;ll never see him again. My dad, I think, subconsciously knows but just won&rsquo;t accept that I got hurt so much from this and the fact that I&rsquo;ve had such a hard time with his death. I think he just wants me to be the way I was. I&rsquo;ve gotten very close to Buck, Peter and Stephen. Turns out Buck was captured by HYDRA too so he helps me and I help him; plus he&rsquo;s as old as Steve and used to be friends with him so that&rsquo;s cool. Peter lost his mother and was adopted (kinda) by a blue dude who was super cool but sadly died and his actual dad tried to hypnotize him, kill all his friends and the galaxy and gave Peter&rsquo;s mom cancer. Stephen got in an accident and his hands got kinda messed up and now they shake a lot, but he used to be a surgeon and with his hands all shaky he had to stop and then he found that Wong guy who taught him magic and this cap he wears all the time is like basically a friend of his (still confused about the cape thing). But he lost a person he was in love with because of what happened so he helps me a lot with the whole Pietro situation.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still having trouble fully accepting all of what happened but I&rsquo;m getting closer and closer everyday. I&rsquo;m not as depressed as I was so I can genuinely be happy once and a while and I&rsquo;ve stopped isolating. Turns out the new people on the team are really cool. Plus, Loki&rsquo;s back!</p><p>Today is sadly my birthday and no I am not exactly excited about it. I hate my birthday with a passion of a thousand suns. I don&rsquo;t want gifts, I don&rsquo;t want cake, don&rsquo;t want candles and I don&rsquo;t want today to be different then any other day, meaning I don&rsquo;t want something special to happen. But with my family something will happen. I know that some of them will get me a gift because they all but tortured me to tell them what I want; I finally broke and told them I want shirts that will remind me of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, birthday girl!&rdquo; My dad practically yelled after he woke my up and I forced myself to open my eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you not to make a big deal. So what? Oh, wow, I haven&rsquo;t died yet and I&rsquo;m one year older; big whoop.&rdquo; I remark being as sarcastic as possible. &ldquo;Well we have to celebrate. Everyone is too excited for you for us not to celebrate!&rdquo; I groan at my dad&rsquo;s remark but get up anyways.</p><p>I follow my dad to the dining room; not even bothering to change out of my plain white t-shirt and fuzzy pajama pants that resemble a blue poodle skirt. I get into the informal dining room and see everyone there; except for T'Challa who is back in Wakanda and Spidey who is probably with his Aunt at home.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys! Look M&amp;M is finally awake!&rdquo; Buck belted getting everyone&rsquo;s attention. He&rsquo;s normally not one to draw attention or be loud so this sudden loud outburst kind of surprises me. I roll my eyes at him but can&rsquo;t help but smile due to the nickname.</p><p>&ldquo;So can I have breakfast or do I have to do something amazing because it&rsquo;s my birthday?&rdquo;</p><p>Before I can even sit down Clint says &ldquo;Well, a hand stand into a somersault followed by a pose would be pretty cool.&rdquo; I groan but sit at the breakfast bar next to Wanda. &ldquo;So how you doing, Buckaroo, Bird Brain?&rdquo; I ask Buck and Clint with a smirk.</p><p>Then Stephen starts to give everyone breakfast; my favorite, waffles with mashed up strawberries, hash browns and orange juice. Even my dog, Tonks, runs up to me and licks my hand. &ldquo;Hey Tonks!&rdquo; I say in a happy voice. &ldquo;Wait, why does the dog get a happy face when she says happy birthday?&rdquo; Clint asks. &ldquo;Because, Old Man, Tonks is much cuter then any of you.&rdquo; I reply making sure to push one of his several buttons that annoy him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know why we got you that dog?&rdquo; Steve asks. &ldquo;No, Capsicle, enlighten me.&rdquo; I tell him in response. &ldquo;Well, after 'Civil War&rsquo;, as you like to call it, all of us,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The ones that were part of it.&rdquo; Wanda clarifies. &ldquo;Chipped in and got Tonks for you, basically as a thank you of sorts.&rdquo; Steve continues.</p><p>I stare at him and raise an eyebrow. &ldquo;Well, in that fight you all must have hit your head pretty hard to think that you need to thank me. I didn&rsquo;t fight in it remember.&rdquo; I say rather bluntly. \u00a0&quot;Well, technically, no you didn&rsquo;t. But you listened to all of us and our point of view. Plus you helped Bucky when we all came back together to fight again.&ldquo; Steve tells me.</p><p>&quot;Hell yeah she did.&rdquo; Bucky pipes up. And then pats my back. &ldquo;Well, how could I not? He&rsquo;s basically a lost puppy!&rdquo; I say then send a smirk his way to which he pretends to be offended which makes me stick out my tongue at him like a child.</p><p>After this we all eat and chat like usual. But then what I feared would happen happened; everyone slowly started to pull out bags or wrapped gifts out for under their seats.</p><p>I groan and then say &ldquo;Why do you guys love to torture me? You&rsquo;re supposed to be the good guys!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a pretty simple reason really, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s hilarious.&rdquo; Responses Loki. I roll my eyes. &ldquo;If I get anything other than a shirt or sweatshirt or something I might have to kill all of you, and I will not hesitate.&rdquo; I tell them.</p><p>Once everyone is done eating I decided to just get it over with. I open each present rather fast even though I do like all of the shirts.</p><p>Dad got me an iron man shirt that was basically just a picture of his suit on a shirt. Steve got me a shirt that had and older picture of him in his suit that said 'I want YOU&rsquo; then the picture of him and then on the bottom it continued with 'to WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE NOW&rsquo;. Thor got me a shirt with a his hammer on it in a circle. Nat got me a shirt that looked like the top part of her suit. Clint got me a white shirt with 'I&rsquo; then a heart with an arrow in it the underneath it said 'Hawkeye&rsquo;. Bruce got me a shirt that had the hulk&rsquo;s figure in green then in front of it was a smaller man&rsquo;s figure whom was Bruce. Pepper said she couldn&rsquo;t find anything like her so she got me a grey shirt with fake rips on them that reviled the iron man chest. Bucky got me a sweatshirt with his metal arm printed on it. Stephen got me a black shirt that said 'Dormammu&rsquo; then his cape and inside that it said 'I&rsquo;ve come to bargain&rsquo;. Peter (Quill) gave me one of his shirts that had some alien language on it but it kinda looked like it said 'Yeah Baby&rsquo;. Wanda gave me a red shirt that had her on it and said 'Scarlet Witch&rsquo; on it. T'calla sent me a sweatshirt that looked like his suit with his necklace. Loki gave me a shirt with a really cute almost babyish version of him in his 'suit&rsquo; and it said 'Kneel before me!!!&rsquo;. Spidey gave me a shirt with his masked face as a bunch of emotions. Scott gave me a shirt that looked like his Ant-Man suit. Vision gave me a shirt that looked like his cape. Rhodey gave me a shirt that looked like his suit. Sam gave me what he looks like in the same babyish style as Loki&rsquo;s in his suit. Nebula gave me a shirt with the nebula on it. Mantis gave me a shirt with her on it and the word 'Mantis&rsquo; on it. Glamora gave me a shirt with her face on it as a wanted poster. Groot gave me a white shirt with a chest pocket that made it look like he was half in it and half out.</p><p>&ldquo;Aw guys, this is so sweet; and you all actually listened to me for once!&rdquo; I tease at the end.</p><p>&ldquo;There is one more gift.&rdquo; Wanda says. She pulls out a bag with a cloud design on it. I look at her questioningly but pull out the contents of the bag anyways. It&rsquo;s what looks like Pietro&rsquo;s old shirt. My breath hitches at the sight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of Pietro&rsquo;s old shirts. I figured you would like one.&rdquo; Wanda stats. I look at her &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need this. You already gave me one of his blankets.&rdquo; She then smiles at me. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t need it, but I want you to have it; Pietro would want you to have it.&rdquo; I get up and go to hug her and she soon copies. I whisper in her ear &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She whispers back &ldquo;No problem, you deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>We break apart and I look at all the shirts taking in every detail. <i>I am so lucky to have all these amazing people in my life; I love them all so much. </i>I end up looking just at Pietro&rsquo;s old one.</p><p>I snap myself out of my thoughts. &ldquo;Well I should go get changed into actual clothes.&rdquo; I announce to everyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Wear one of the shirts!&rdquo; Peter says excited. &ldquo;I am Groot!&rdquo; Groot agrees. &ldquo;I was planning on it.&rdquo; I respond. Then everyone starts to argue about who&rsquo;s shirt I should put on. I roll my eyes for the hundredth time today and walk to my room to get changed.</p><p>I end up putting on Pietro&rsquo;s old shirt, which is rather tight in the chest area, some old ripped up plain jeans and some sea foam green Converse. I put my hair up into a high ponytail. I don&rsquo;t bother to put on makeup because I am way too lazy to really ever do that; it&rsquo;s just gonna get messed up anyways. I put on a Doctor Who bracelet and a small rose gold bracelet that says 'Stay Strong&rsquo; engraved on it. But finally I put on a silver crown ring on I got from an unknown person on my birthday before the last fight with Ultron.</p><p>I pick up the book I&rsquo;m reading, for the hundredth and tenth time, <b><i>Let It Snow</i></b> by John Green, Lauren Myracle and Maureen Johnson.</p><p>Before I leave me room I say something to 'Pietro&rsquo; or nothingness, still not sure which. &ldquo;Hey, I miss you, a lot. I miss you all the time. Every second. And I want you to know I don&rsquo;t blame you for what happened, I don&rsquo;t think I ever will.&rdquo;</p><p>I walk out of my room and down the hall to the elevator. I get in and go down to the main level so I can leave the tower and go to my favorite place in the world, the book store down the street.</p><p>Before I can reach the door I hear Wanda say telepathically &ldquo;Wait for me. I will be down in one moment.&rdquo; I do as she says and wait by the door for her and, like she said, she is down soon there after.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I go with you to the bookstore?&rdquo; She asks me like I would ever say no to her company. &ldquo;Yeah, of course!&rdquo; I reply without missing a beat. &ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; I ask her and gesture to the door. &ldquo;We shall.&rdquo; She says linking her arm with mine.</p><p>Once we get to the bookstore our paths part. I go and look around at all the books and merchandise for some of the books. I read the back of one which catches my attention. It&rsquo;s called <b><i>To All the Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before </i></b>by Jenny Han. I sit down at a booth they have by a coffee, tea and some pastries bar type thing.</p><p>I order my mint tea and blueberry muffin then hear Wanda&rsquo;s voice in my head. &ldquo;I apparently need to go back to the Tower. I am sorry, I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo; Is all she said before I heard the bell on the door chime signaling someone was entering or exiting.</p><p>I start to read taking a bite of my muffin or a sip of my tea here and there; until I hear Wanda&rsquo;s voice &ldquo;You should come back to the Tower as soon as you can.&rdquo; The bell didn&rsquo;t ring so I know she&rsquo;s not actually here. This mind thing still doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p><p>She said as soon as I can so I get the feeling it&rsquo;s urgent. I run back to the Tower using my speed powers, even though it&rsquo;s just a few minute walk meaning it&rsquo;s probably less then a millisecond run at super speed. I run in the door and use powers to feel where they are. I run to the lab and see everyone standing around a table. &ldquo;What is it? Is everyone okay?!&rdquo; I ask suddenly getting an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and guilt for not being here if something happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Well everyone is okay, even some people we thought weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Bruce says seeming to be very cautious. I feel my eyebrows furrow together in confusion. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I ask felling something bad is about to happen; like how I feel before a fight breaks out.</p><p>Before anyone can answer I feel a slight wind and a hand on my back; no one was behind me. My breathing goes faster. It&rsquo;s one of two things. Either some villain evil guy got in and is gonna kill me or the thing that&rsquo;s okay is Pietro, which seems impossible but weirder things have happened before with this family. I feel a chill run down my spine even thinking about Pietro being alive and breathing again.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello&hellip;&rdquo; I hear something that sounds like Pietro. But that&rsquo;s impossible, even for us. There is no way a dead person can come back to life, absolutely no way.</p><p>My eyes flicker between Bruce and my father at a rapid pace; barely enough time for me to even see them. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Is all I can think to say. <i>Why would they make a thing that sounds like him!? Did they think this would help Me and Wanda!?</i> A million other thoughts race through my mind at a mile a second. They look at me even more confused then they already where.</p><p>Before I can even think about anything else to say a Pietro lookalike is standing in front of me. &ldquo;I have missed you.&rdquo; Is all it says. I look at it not wanting to show any emotion but my nose betrays me by twitching in anger. I don&rsquo;t take my eyes of the presumed robot. &ldquo;How could you!? Did you think this would help me!? 'Yeah lets make a robot of Pietro to help Morgan and Wanda! That&rsquo;s a great idea!&rsquo;&rdquo; I use a dumb sounding voice at the end to imitate them. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; The robot asks looking rather hurt. &ldquo;What did you use to make it have thoughts and emotions? I get how you did it with Vision but how did you do it with this?&rdquo; I ask sounding startling calm even to me. But before they can even think about what I just said I spit out &ldquo;Know what? I don&rsquo;t want to know! I&rsquo;ll be in my room, don&rsquo;t bother me unless it is absolutely necessary.&rdquo; I say then storm out of the room not even bothering to look back even slightly.</p><p>Hot tears sting my eyes and fall down my heated, no doubtably reddened face. I&rsquo;m so angry that I can barely control my own powers. All I can think about is how they could do that. I&rsquo;m Tony&rsquo;s niece who I thought he considered a daughter yet he had the brilliant idea to do this or help do this.</p><p>I get to my room, shut my door with a loud thud and slam my body onto my bed wanting to scream, cry, and punch all at the same time. I wrap myself in the mint blue blanket that Wanda gave me of Pietro&rsquo;s. Between the shirt and the blanket it smells and feels like Pietro is here with me, here living again. I don&rsquo;t bother to hold back anymore; I sob.</p><p>I end up talk to nothingness again hoping that somewhere Pietro can hear, even if it&rsquo;s in a different universe. &ldquo;How much longer do I need to fake being happy? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be whole again. I lost the one person I never knew I needed, how ironic is that. I want you back. I don&rsquo;t want to cry anymore, I don&rsquo;t want to fake happy, I don&rsquo;t want to forget you and I don&rsquo;t want to have to fight to stay okay anymore. I still love everything about you, Pietro. The only thing I don&rsquo;t love about you is the fact you aren&rsquo;t with me. I feel less empty then I was but I don&rsquo;t know why, I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m feeling kinda okay. I mean I&rsquo;m mad and sad but I don&rsquo;t know, what if that was-&rdquo; I cut myself off. &ldquo;No that&rsquo;s insane.&rdquo;</p><p>I hear a knock on my door. I&rsquo;m not okay but I&rsquo;m not showing that to everyone else. It honestly hurts a lot, but I&rsquo;m gonna keep it inside and to myself so it doesn&rsquo;t hurt anyone else.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; I ask. I&rsquo;m not ready to see dad or Bruce.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Steve.&rdquo; Say the voice that belongs to Steve on the other said of the door. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p><p>He opens the door and comes inside. But he doesn&rsquo;t shut the door behind him. I sit up on my bed so he has a place to sit. He does sit, next to me.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t talk for a moment or two. &ldquo;I know this is tough. I kind of went through it with Bucky so I sort of know how your feeling on some level.&rdquo; He takes a deep breath and I assume he&rsquo;s planning out his next words; this makes me have a feeling I&rsquo;m not going to like what he&rsquo;s going to say. &ldquo;I know this is gonna be tough to hear but it&rsquo;s him, and before you get defensive or upset just hear me out. Even if you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s him isn&rsquo;t it worth a shot to see if it is, I mean seriously. We all noticed how upset you got after everything happened that day. Plus if it&rsquo;s him I mean think about how much he&rsquo;s missed out on, he&rsquo;s gonna need a friendly face. I&rsquo;m not gonna say I know for sure it&rsquo;s him but even Wanda thinks it is. So if there is any chance it&rsquo;s him, I suggest you take it. If it&rsquo;s not him and you get even slightly hurt I will owe you so so much and you can completely blame me.&rdquo; He finishes and he seems to wait for my answer.</p><p>It takes me a while to think over everything he said but I do eventually come to a conclusion. I nod seeming to get the message to him that I&rsquo;m going to take the chance that it might be him.</p><p>He gets up and I follow having to focus on what I&rsquo;m doing just to get my legs to move. Steve doesn&rsquo;t even give me a chance to rethink before he takes my shoulder in his hand lightly and directs me to where Pietro is.</p><p>We get to the lab and see the silver haired boy looking down at his hands that are fidgeting on his lap. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen him move in so long. I visited him or his body everyday since the incident. Steve doesn&rsquo;t push or pressure me to go in he seems to be letting me go in when I&rsquo;m ready and I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for that.</p><p>I take a deep breath and open the glass door by the metal bar handle. For once I&rsquo;m grateful that the monitors and other equipment are in the other room. This means it&rsquo;s only Pietro and I in the room since Steve isn&rsquo;t coming in and went the the other room to check medical things with everyone else.</p><p>I stand next to the door rethinking my choice. Before I can escape without him noticing the door shuts making a soft noise that Pietro notices. His head darts up. When he sees me his whole demeanor changes. At first he seems extremely happy to see me, then relieved, then confused and finally sad or maybe guilty.</p><p>&ldquo;May I come over?&rdquo; I ask trying to break the awkward silence. He just nods indicting that I can move towards him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to freak out, I just don&rsquo;t really trust that it&rsquo;s you. I mean you were gone I just don&rsquo;t understand how this could happen.&rdquo; I try to explain feeling guilt starting to drown me.</p><p>&ldquo;You have no reason to be sorry. I am the one who messed up. I am the one who did this.&rdquo; He says. He hasn&rsquo;t stopped moving since I first saw him. I feel tears sting my eyes again, but this time they are from being guilty and I have so much remorse for what I did.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what to say, so I do the only thing I can think to do; I hug him. He doesn&rsquo;t even seem to think. He immediately hugs me back as if we were meant to be like this, which maybe we were.</p><p>We pull back after what seemed like hours. This is the first time I really look at his face. His electric blue eyes are full of energy and light. His face is still pale but now it&rsquo;s just pale it&rsquo;s not dead person, no blood flow pale. His lips have color they are slightly pink and purple but they aren&rsquo;t just pale and lifeless. This is when I finally realize that what I was being told was and is true.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo; I all I can say over the shock. </p><p>He then reply&rsquo;s with: </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see that coming?&rdquo;</p>",

They are on a mission and I\u2019m in the helicopter; back-up.</p><p>\u201cAnswer it please, oh and call me Morgan, please.\u201d No matter how many times I tell it to call me Morgan it just doesn\u2019t. \u201cHello dad. Need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, M. Yeah we do; we have an enhanced.\u201d He says. \u201cGive me two seconds, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>I run into the field and see Clint on the ground, shot, with Nat next to him. \u201cDo I need to bring your ass back to the copter or do I get the ass hat that did this to you?\"I ask him.</p><p>\"Get him. Oh and by the way he has super speed and said \u2018You didn\u2019t see that coming?\u2019 so use that when you get him.\u201d Says Clint. I smile and say \u201cWill do, Old Man!\u201d I then run off not wanting to hear him lie saying he\u2019s not old when he is. I run around until I see the enhanced.</p><p><i>Okay so best course of action is probably to run into him. </i>So of course that\u2019s what I do. I run into him at full speed making him fall to the ground on his back but I was ready; I just stand firm.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see that coming?\u201d I ask him as he\u2019s on the ground. \u201cKay, got speedy. What should I do with him?\u201d I ask over the intercoms that I couldn\u2019t hear while running. No one answers. <i>Of course you don\u2019t answer the girl with the super human, that makes total sense to me\u2026</i></p><p>Speedy gets up but I quickly grab his wrist so he can\u2019t run. He looks at me and I give him a smile. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Morgan. Since my fantastic team members aren\u2019t answering I\u2019ll be with you for a while; better get used to me.\u201d He doesn\u2019t respond, but he does look at me and I get to study his features a little. \u201cWait, it\u2019s you. Where\u2019s your sister?\u201d I look at him concerned. <i>What if we didn\u2019t get here in time to save her!?</i></p><p>\u201cHow do you know me or my sister?\u201d He asks, he has an accent.</p><p>\u201cWell, I see things and you and your sister, I\u2019ve been seeing you two a lot. Listen, I\u2019m like you. I\u2019ve been experimented on, it\u2019s how I got my powers; same with Steve; so I know what it\u2019s like. We don\u2019t want to hurt you, we want to put the guys who did this to you in jail; we don\u2019t even want to hurt them, but if we have to to get them behind bars then we are gonna. But, we don\u2019t want to hurt you so please don\u2019t hurt us. These guys are my family, they\u2019re all I got so please don\u2019t hurt them; you wouldn\u2019t like t if your sister got hurt and I don\u2019t like it when my family gets hurt either.\u201d He has a small smile on his face but it soon disappears. \u201cHow do I know you aren\u2019t lying?\u201d He asks. \u201cWell, for starters, your sisters name is Wanda, I believe. Your\u2019s is Pietro. You have super speed she has telekinetic powers. Yes?\u201d</p><p>Before he can answer I sense something. <i>He\u2019s in trouble!</i> I let go of Pietro and run to dad. When I do get there he\u2019s at the scepter but he seems to be in a trance, with Wanda behind him; she\u2019s doing it.</p><p>\u201cNot cool.\u201d I say in her direction. \u201cDad?\u201d No response. \u201cHello?\u201d<i> I\u2019m skipping all this stuff.</i> I slap him, but not too hard; it might still leave a bruise. He snaps out of it and grabs the scepter then leaves.</p><p>I huff a little. <i>Wow, you\u2019re welcome</i>. \u201cWow, that was real cool,\u201d I say sarcastically to Wanda who now has Pietro next to her. I wait or dramatic effect. \u201cWanda.\u201d I then speed out of that creepy place.</p><p>I get to the aircraft before dad. \u201cHello, everybody!\u201d I smile at everyone. Before they can even ask I inform them. \u201cDad got the scepter, but the girl used her powers on him so\u2026 yeah. Oh and the boys name is Pietro, he has super speed, and the girls name is Wanda, she has telekinetic powers. Pietro seems decent but Wanda I\u2019m not particularly fond of, for obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, the lullaby worked better than ever.\u201d Nat says after she gets Bruce\u2019s attention off of his opera music.</p><p>\u201cJust wasn\u2019t expecting the Code Green.\u201d He says a little frazzled. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been there, there would\u2019ve been double the casualties. My best friend would\u2019ve been a treasured memory.\u201d She says talking about Clint. \u201cYou know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn\u2019t exactly what I want to hear.\u201d \u201cHow long before you trust me?\u201d<br></p><p>They keep talking but it\u2019s all very boring so I put on my headphones and listen to some music; mostly musicals and some rock here and there. I pull out my <b><i>Kindle</i></b> and continue reading <b><i>Everything, Everything</i></b> by Nicola Yoon.</p><p>I look up and everyone is leaving the plane.</p><p>\u201cWow, thanks for telling me we landed.\u201d I remarked sarcastically, but no one even looks at me. That was a pretty good remark.</p><p>I get out of the aircraft and go into the tower to makes some tea and read a good book.</p><p>~~During the battle~~</p><p>I sit on the aircraft like I always do during the fun battles. I wait for everyone to come back from the fight with Ultron. Well that\u2019s before I get a vision of Clint shielding a child and then the sound of gun shots.</p><p>I look up and see people getting on; civilians. I run out and start looking for the place I saw from the vision.</p><p>As I the sight gets into view I hear a gun shot. My hand shoots up and I hope something would happen. I close my eyes tightly and hope something protected Clint and the child; I hope something shields them from the bullets. I feel something I can\u2019t really describe at that time. </p><p>I don\u2019t look till somebody puts a hand on my shoulder. <i>Please be a good guy. Please be a good guy. </i>I look behind me and see the Archer. I sigh in relief that he and the child are alright.</p><p>I flood him with a million questions. \u201cWhat happened? Are you alright? Did you get hurt? Where\u2019s the kid? Are they okay?\u201d He waits for me to stop. When I finally do he replies \u201cA shield type thing saved me and Pietro; he was gonna take the bullets and if you had been a millisecond later he\u2019d be all hole-y. I\u2019m fine. No I didn\u2019t get hurt, well from that. The kid went back to his mother. And he\u2019s fine.\u201d I look at him shocked. \u201cHow do you know it was me with the shield?\u201d \u201cWell you still find new powers so I guessed\u2026\u201d I look down at my hand and see a blue-green mist coming from it.</p><p>Speedster then basically appears in front of me. \u201cYou are okay?\u201d He asks like I could have gotten hurt when I was probably a good few feet away. \u201cI mean yeah, I felt\u2026 something. But yeah I\u2019m fine. Nothing injured, from that at least.\u201d I chuckle nervously trying to lighten the tension.</p><p>That of course didn\u2019t work. Both the boys still seemed worried and amazed. \u201cWell, we should get back.\u201d I tell them but this is the first time I looked at Pietro for more then a millisecond. \u201cYou- you have a- a bullet hole!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cWell, um, yes. But it will not hurt for long.\u201d He tries to calm me which worked as well as me trying to calm him. \u201cThat means it hurts. Go with Clint, don\u2019t get in trouble and find everyone else. I\u2019ll do a quick look over of the place,\u201d I look at both the boys and say this but then look only at Pietro \u201cAnd get that fixed up; wouldn\u2019t want you hole-y.\u201d I try and joke.</p><p>Before Clint can complain about me stealing his joke I run off to do a check of the area. I find Wanda with several 'dead\u2019 robot things around her (Ultron\u2019s team). She\u2019s sobbing like part of her died.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d I say carefully.</p><p>\u201cPietro, he\u2019s hurt or dead!\u201d She says between sobs, whimpers and shaky breath. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead! Don\u2019t worry he\u2019ll be fine. Just one bullet hit him, I saw him and the wound myself. He was gonna die to protect a child and Clint.\u201d I explain to her. \u201cHow- who- Why?!\u201d She says not knowing exactly what to ask first. \u201cIt was with a machine gun, Ultron or one of his goons and because he\u2019s on the other team?\u201d I say more of a question. \u201cIf it was in fact a machine gun, how is he not dead?\u201d She questions seeming happy yet curious. \u201cWell, um, I have these power, I guess, that just kinda pop up. I shielded him and Clint, or at least that\u2019s what Clint says is what happened.\u201d I try to play it cool; probably failing miserably.</p><p>She looks at me then walks up to me and hugs me. I hug her back rather awkwardly due to me not really knowing her or being a touchy-feely kind of person. She pulls away and says \u201cThank you, He is the only one I have left.\u201d I smile at her then say \u201cWell, yes and no. I\u2019m pretty sure you and your brother are Avengers now, so you have me and the team now. Trust me, the team will treat you like family; they always have with me at least, and I\u2019m sure you two will be no different.\u201d \u00a0I smile at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, we have to get back to leave this place ASAP!\u201d I tell her. She takes off flying (only a few inches off the ground) towards the aircraft. I soon follow suit but running instead of flying. But before we can even get there I feel as though my heart was ripped out in front of me and squeezed till every drop and ounce of blood has dripped out; and then it was forced back into my empty cavity of a chest.</p><p>I fall to my knees and quiver;not being able to to breathe. I know who it is that made me feel this way and why.</p><p>\u201cPietro\u2026\u201d Is all I can think to say. I look over to see Wanda on her knees doing the same a me. It seems we both know that something horrible happened to him.<i> I wasn\u2019t there to save him this time; I failed him, I might as well have killed him myself.</i></p><p>I put my hand on Wanda\u2019s shoulder to try and comfort her. Before I even know it she\u2019s hugging me and I her. I cry and walk back to the aircraft with Wanda right next to me; we don\u2019t need to say anything for her to know that we both loved him (yes, in different ways but still love and such).</p><p>We finally get back to everyone else, but before they can even ask me any questions I put my headphones on and close my eyes and listen to <b>'Not About Angels\u2019 </b>by <b>Birdy</b>\u2026 for the whole time to get to the tower\u2026 which probably isn\u2019t the best thing to do right now but I honestly couldn\u2019t care less at this point.</p><p>No one talked, they just looked at Wanda sympathetically and at me with confusion and sadness in their eyes. No one knew I liked him, I barely knew I liked him; but now I know that I loved him. Well at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing this newly found emotion is.</p><p>We land, I\u2019m the first one out and immediately go to my room. I keep my headphones and close the door, not even bothering to lock it, then flop on my bed. I have no tears to cry but it\u2019s like I can\u2019t feel anything but so much regret.</p><p><i>I ignored him, he tried to talk to me in the tower and I ignored him. How could I have done that? I only did that because he hurt my family and he said sorry god knows how many times. I denied my feelings and tried to make myself believe that I didn\u2019t like him. Now I can\u2019t even tell him, now he\u2019s gone and it\u2019s all my fault. I should have helped and saved him somehow. I should have been the one to die, it shouldn\u2019t have been him.</i></p><p>I stay in my room for weeks only ever coming out for meals or to go to the bathroom. I\u2019m not doing the one thing I would have killed to do at one point, fighting the bad guy; helping anyway I could. Everyone has come in a saw me; Steve, Clint, Nat, Bruce, everyone. My dad is trying his best but I can\u2019t get over this, I miss him so much. They are keeping his body in the lab, I have no clue as to why but they are.</p><p>At first my mind loved to play tricks on me; show me visions of him waking up or coming to see me or smile and eating in the kitchen with everyone. I would believe that he would wake up, but it never happened, he never woke up.</p><p>Then I went to the anger stage of grief and went to the gym and training room; I would punch anything I could, I would kick robot ass and I would work my ass off pushing myself to just destroy something. I would get irritated very easily. During this time we got a new member his name is Bucky or Buck or whatever stupid nickname Dad gave him.</p><p>I soon got to the bargaining stage. During this I would talk into the obis just hoping that there was a god or something that was able to bring him back or just let me see him one last time. At one point I asked Thor if he could do something, but he couldn\u2019t. I asked if there was a way for me to go back to that day, for me to die instead; still nothing. During this the Avengers fought, got two new member who\u2019s names are Peter or spider man or Spidey, and Bucky, or Buck, or the Winter Shoulder. then made up to fight a big baddie whom killed people I never met ( Drax, Wong and a Raccoon thing I think his name was Rocket).</p><p>So here I am, fighting my own battle with depression. But I\u2019ve gotten really good at pretending that I\u2019m fine and I\u2019ve gotten over it. Some people see through it (Stephen Strange, Wanda, Loki, Buck and Peter Quill). I\u2019ve gotten decently close with all the new guys, they all seem pretty decent and like an extended family. Wanda has gotten really close with Vision and they are even dating, which I\u2019m in full support of!</p><p>The people who see through my act have tried to help and all that but as much as they try I still am having trouble accepting the fact that I will never get Pietro back, that I\u2019ll never see him again. My dad, I think, subconsciously knows but just won\u2019t accept that I got hurt so much from this and the fact that I\u2019ve had such a hard time with his death. I think he just wants me to be the way I was. I\u2019ve gotten very close to Buck, Peter and Stephen. Turns out Buck was captured by HYDRA too so he helps me and I help him; plus he\u2019s as old as Steve and used to be friends with him so that\u2019s cool. Peter lost his mother and was adopted (kinda) by a blue dude who was super cool but sadly died and his actual dad tried to hypnotize him, kill all his friends and the galaxy and gave Peter\u2019s mom cancer. Stephen got in an accident and his hands got kinda messed up and now they shake a lot, but he used to be a surgeon and with his hands all shaky he had to stop and then he found that Wong guy who taught him magic and this cap he wears all the time is like basically a friend of his (still confused about the cape thing). But he lost a person he was in love with because of what happened so he helps me a lot with the whole Pietro situation.</p><p>I\u2019m still having trouble fully accepting all of what happened but I\u2019m getting closer and closer everyday. I\u2019m not as depressed as I was so I can genuinely be happy once and a while and I\u2019ve stopped isolating. Turns out the new people on the team are really cool. Plus, Loki\u2019s back!</p><p>Today is sadly my birthday and no I am not exactly excited about it. I hate my birthday with a passion of a thousand suns. I don\u2019t want gifts, I don\u2019t want cake, don\u2019t want candles and I don\u2019t want today to be different then any other day, meaning I don\u2019t want something special to happen. But with my family something will happen. I know that some of them will get me a gift because they all but tortured me to tell them what I want; I finally broke and told them I want shirts that will remind me of them.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, birthday girl!\u201d My dad practically yelled after he woke my up and I forced myself to open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to make a big deal. So what? Oh, wow, I haven\u2019t died yet and I\u2019m one year older; big whoop.\u201d I remark being as sarcastic as possible. \u201cWell we have to celebrate. Everyone is too excited for you for us not to celebrate!\u201d I groan at my dad\u2019s remark but get up anyways.</p><p>I follow my dad to the dining room; not even bothering to change out of my plain white t-shirt and fuzzy pajama pants that resemble a blue poodle skirt. I get into the informal dining room and see everyone there; except for T'Challa who is back in Wakanda and Spidey who is probably with his Aunt at home.</p><p>\u201cHey guys! Look M&amp;M is finally awake!\u201d Buck belted getting everyone\u2019s attention. He\u2019s normally not one to draw attention or be loud so this sudden loud outburst kind of surprises me. I roll my eyes at him but can\u2019t help but smile due to the nickname.</p><p>\u201cSo can I have breakfast or do I have to do something amazing because it\u2019s my birthday?\u201d</p><p>Before I can even sit down Clint says \u201cWell, a hand stand into a somersault followed by a pose would be pretty cool.\u201d I groan but sit at the breakfast bar next to Wanda. \u201cSo how you doing, Buckaroo, Bird Brain?\u201d I ask Buck and Clint with a smirk.</p><p>Then Stephen starts to give everyone breakfast; my favorite, waffles with mashed up strawberries, hash browns and orange juice. Even my dog, Tonks, runs up to me and licks my hand. \u201cHey Tonks!\u201d I say in a happy voice. \u201cWait, why does the dog get a happy face when she says happy birthday?\u201d Clint asks. \u201cBecause, Old Man, Tonks is much cuter then any of you.\u201d I reply making sure to push one of his several buttons that annoy him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why we got you that dog?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cNo, Capsicle, enlighten me.\u201d I tell him in response. \u201cWell, after 'Civil War\u2019, as you like to call it, all of us,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones that were part of it.\u201d Wanda clarifies. \u201cChipped in and got Tonks for you, basically as a thank you of sorts.\u201d Steve continues.</p><p>I stare at him and raise an eyebrow. \u201cWell, in that fight you all must have hit your head pretty hard to think that you need to thank me. I didn\u2019t fight in it remember.\u201d I say rather bluntly. \u00a0\"Well, technically, no you didn\u2019t. But you listened to all of us and our point of view. Plus you helped Bucky when we all came back together to fight again.\u201c Steve tells me.</p><p>\"Hell yeah she did.\u201d Bucky pipes up. And then pats my back. \u201cWell, how could I not? He\u2019s basically a lost puppy!\u201d I say then send a smirk his way to which he pretends to be offended which makes me stick out my tongue at him like a child.</p><p>After this we all eat and chat like usual. But then what I feared would happen happened; everyone slowly started to pull out bags or wrapped gifts out for under their seats.</p><p>I groan and then say \u201cWhy do you guys love to torture me? You\u2019re supposed to be the good guys!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a pretty simple reason really, it\u2019s because it\u2019s hilarious.\u201d Responses Loki. I roll my eyes. \u201cIf I get anything other than a shirt or sweatshirt or something I might have to kill all of you, and I will not hesitate.\u201d I tell them.</p><p>Once everyone is done eating I decided to just get it over with. I open each present rather fast even though I do like all of the shirts.</p><p>Dad got me an iron man shirt that was basically just a picture of his suit on a shirt. Steve got me a shirt that had and older picture of him in his suit that said 'I want YOU\u2019 then the picture of him and then on the bottom it continued with 'to WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE NOW\u2019. Thor got me a shirt with a his hammer on it in a circle. Nat got me a shirt that looked like the top part of her suit. Clint got me a white shirt with 'I\u2019 then a heart with an arrow in it the underneath it said 'Hawkeye\u2019. Bruce got me a shirt that had the hulk\u2019s figure in green then in front of it was a smaller man\u2019s figure whom was Bruce. Pepper said she couldn\u2019t find anything like her so she got me a grey shirt with fake rips on them that reviled the iron man chest. Bucky got me a sweatshirt with his metal arm printed on it. Stephen got me a black shirt that said 'Dormammu\u2019 then his cape and inside that it said 'I\u2019ve come to bargain\u2019. Peter (Quill) gave me one of his shirts that had some alien language on it but it kinda looked like it said 'Yeah Baby\u2019. Wanda gave me a red shirt that had her on it and said 'Scarlet Witch\u2019 on it. T'calla sent me a sweatshirt that looked like his suit with his necklace. Loki gave me a shirt with a really cute almost babyish version of him in his 'suit\u2019 and it said 'Kneel before me!!!\u2019. Spidey gave me a shirt with his masked face as a bunch of emotions. Scott gave me a shirt that looked like his Ant-Man suit. Vision gave me a shirt that looked like his cape. Rhodey gave me a shirt that looked like his suit. Sam gave me what he looks like in the same babyish style as Loki\u2019s in his suit. Nebula gave me a shirt with the nebula on it. Mantis gave me a shirt with her on it and the word 'Mantis\u2019 on it. Glamora gave me a shirt with her face on it as a wanted poster. Groot gave me a white shirt with a chest pocket that made it look like he was half in it and half out.</p><p>\u201cAw guys, this is so sweet; and you all actually listened to me for once!\u201d I tease at the end.</p><p>\u201cThere is one more gift.\u201d Wanda says. She pulls out a bag with a cloud design on it. I look at her questioningly but pull out the contents of the bag anyways. It\u2019s what looks like Pietro\u2019s old shirt. My breath hitches at the sight. \u201cIt\u2019s one of Pietro\u2019s old shirts. I figured you would like one.\u201d Wanda stats. I look at her \u201cI don\u2019t need this. You already gave me one of his blankets.\u201d She then smiles at me. \u201cI know you don\u2019t need it, but I want you to have it; Pietro would want you to have it.\u201d I get up and go to hug her and she soon copies. I whisper in her ear \u201cThank you.\u201d She whispers back \u201cNo problem, you deserve it.\u201d</p><p>We break apart and I look at all the shirts taking in every detail. <i>I am so lucky to have all these amazing people in my life; I love them all so much. </i>I end up looking just at Pietro\u2019s old one.</p><p>I snap myself out of my thoughts. \u201cWell I should go get changed into actual clothes.\u201d I announce to everyone.</p><p>\u201cWear one of the shirts!\u201d Peter says excited. \u201cI am Groot!\u201d Groot agrees. \u201cI was planning on it.\u201d I respond. Then everyone starts to argue about who\u2019s shirt I should put on. I roll my eyes for the hundredth time today and walk to my room to get changed.</p><p>I end up putting on Pietro\u2019s old shirt, which is rather tight in the chest area, some old ripped up plain jeans and some sea foam green Converse. I put my hair up into a high ponytail. I don\u2019t bother to put on makeup because I am way too lazy to really ever do that; it\u2019s just gonna get messed up anyways. I put on a Doctor Who bracelet and a small rose gold bracelet that says 'Stay Strong\u2019 engraved on it. But finally I put on a silver crown ring on I got from an unknown person on my birthday before the last fight with Ultron.</p><p>I pick up the book I\u2019m reading, for the hundredth and tenth time, <b><i>Let It Snow</i></b> by John Green, Lauren Myracle and Maureen Johnson.</p><p>Before I leave me room I say something to 'Pietro\u2019 or nothingness, still not sure which. \u201cHey, I miss you, a lot. I miss you all the time. Every second. And I want you to know I don\u2019t blame you for what happened, I don\u2019t think I ever will.\u201d</p><p>I walk out of my room and down the hall to the elevator. I get in and go down to the main level so I can leave the tower and go to my favorite place in the world, the book store down the street.</p><p>Before I can reach the door I hear Wanda say telepathically \u201cWait for me. I will be down in one moment.\u201d I do as she says and wait by the door for her and, like she said, she is down soon there after.</p><p>\u201cCan I go with you to the bookstore?\u201d She asks me like I would ever say no to her company. \u201cYeah, of course!\u201d I reply without missing a beat. \u201cShall we?\u201d I ask her and gesture to the door. \u201cWe shall.\u201d She says linking her arm with mine.</p><p>Once we get to the bookstore our paths part. I go and look around at all the books and merchandise for some of the books. I read the back of one which catches my attention. It\u2019s called <b><i>To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before </i></b>by Jenny Han. I sit down at a booth they have by a coffee, tea and some pastries bar type thing.</p><p>I order my mint tea and blueberry muffin then hear Wanda\u2019s voice in my head. \u201cI apparently need to go back to the Tower. I am sorry, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Is all she said before I heard the bell on the door chime signaling someone was entering or exiting.</p><p>I start to read taking a bite of my muffin or a sip of my tea here and there; until I hear Wanda\u2019s voice \u201cYou should come back to the Tower as soon as you can.\u201d The bell didn\u2019t ring so I know she\u2019s not actually here. This mind thing still doesn\u2019t make sense to me.</p><p>She said as soon as I can so I get the feeling it\u2019s urgent. I run back to the Tower using my speed powers, even though it\u2019s just a few minute walk meaning it\u2019s probably less then a millisecond run at super speed. I run in the door and use powers to feel where they are. I run to the lab and see everyone standing around a table. \u201cWhat is it? Is everyone okay?!\u201d I ask suddenly getting an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and guilt for not being here if something happened.</p><p>\u201cWell everyone is okay, even some people we thought weren\u2019t.\u201d Bruce says seeming to be very cautious. I feel my eyebrows furrow together in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask felling something bad is about to happen; like how I feel before a fight breaks out.</p><p>Before anyone can answer I feel a slight wind and a hand on my back; no one was behind me. My breathing goes faster. It\u2019s one of two things. Either some villain evil guy got in and is gonna kill me or the thing that\u2019s okay is Pietro, which seems impossible but weirder things have happened before with this family. I feel a chill run down my spine even thinking about Pietro being alive and breathing again.</p><p>\u201cHello\u2026\u201d I hear something that sounds like Pietro. But that\u2019s impossible, even for us. There is no way a dead person can come back to life, absolutely no way.</p><p>My eyes flicker between Bruce and my father at a rapid pace; barely enough time for me to even see them. \u201cWhy?\u201d Is all I can think to say. <i>Why would they make a thing that sounds like him!? Did they think this would help Me and Wanda!?</i> A million other thoughts race through my mind at a mile a second. They look at me even more confused then they already where.</p><p>Before I can even think about anything else to say a Pietro lookalike is standing in front of me. \u201cI have missed you.\u201d Is all it says. I look at it not wanting to show any emotion but my nose betrays me by twitching in anger. I don\u2019t take my eyes of the presumed robot. \u201cHow could you!? Did you think this would help me!? 'Yeah lets make a robot of Pietro to help Morgan and Wanda! That\u2019s a great idea!\u2019\u201d I use a dumb sounding voice at the end to imitate them. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The robot asks looking rather hurt. \u201cWhat did you use to make it have thoughts and emotions? I get how you did it with Vision but how did you do it with this?\u201d I ask sounding startling calm even to me. But before they can even think about what I just said I spit out \u201cKnow what? I don\u2019t want to know! I\u2019ll be in my room, don\u2019t bother me unless it is absolutely necessary.\u201d I say then storm out of the room not even bothering to look back even slightly.</p><p>Hot tears sting my eyes and fall down my heated, no doubtably reddened face. I\u2019m so angry that I can barely control my own powers. All I can think about is how they could do that. I\u2019m Tony\u2019s niece who I thought he considered a daughter yet he had the brilliant idea to do this or help do this.</p><p>I get to my room, shut my door with a loud thud and slam my body onto my bed wanting to scream, cry, and punch all at the same time. I wrap myself in the mint blue blanket that Wanda gave me of Pietro\u2019s. Between the shirt and the blanket it smells and feels like Pietro is here with me, here living again. I don\u2019t bother to hold back anymore; I sob.</p><p>I end up talk to nothingness again hoping that somewhere Pietro can hear, even if it\u2019s in a different universe. \u201cHow much longer do I need to fake being happy? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be whole again. I lost the one person I never knew I needed, how ironic is that. I want you back. I don\u2019t want to cry anymore, I don\u2019t want to fake happy, I don\u2019t want to forget you and I don\u2019t want to have to fight to stay okay anymore. I still love everything about you, Pietro. The only thing I don\u2019t love about you is the fact you aren\u2019t with me. I feel less empty then I was but I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling kinda okay. I mean I\u2019m mad and sad but I don\u2019t know, what if that was-\u201d I cut myself off. \u201cNo that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>I hear a knock on my door. I\u2019m not okay but I\u2019m not showing that to everyone else. It honestly hurts a lot, but I\u2019m gonna keep it inside and to myself so it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone else.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m not ready to see dad or Bruce.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Steve.\u201d Say the voice that belongs to Steve on the other said of the door. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He opens the door and comes inside. But he doesn\u2019t shut the door behind him. I sit up on my bed so he has a place to sit. He does sit, next to me.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t talk for a moment or two. \u201cI know this is tough. I kind of went through it with Bucky so I sort of know how your feeling on some level.\u201d He takes a deep breath and I assume he\u2019s planning out his next words; this makes me have a feeling I\u2019m not going to like what he\u2019s going to say. \u201cI know this is gonna be tough to hear but it\u2019s him, and before you get defensive or upset just hear me out. Even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s him isn\u2019t it worth a shot to see if it is, I mean seriously. We all noticed how upset you got after everything happened that day. Plus if it\u2019s him I mean think about how much he\u2019s missed out on, he\u2019s gonna need a friendly face. I\u2019m not gonna say I know for sure it\u2019s him but even Wanda thinks it is. So if there is any chance it\u2019s him, I suggest you take it. If it\u2019s not him and you get even slightly hurt I will owe you so so much and you can completely blame me.\u201d He finishes and he seems to wait for my answer.</p><p>It takes me a while to think over everything he said but I do eventually come to a conclusion. I nod seeming to get the message to him that I\u2019m going to take the chance that it might be him.</p><p>He gets up and I follow having to focus on what I\u2019m doing just to get my legs to move. Steve doesn\u2019t even give me a chance to rethink before he takes my shoulder in his hand lightly and directs me to where Pietro is.</p><p>We get to the lab and see the silver haired boy looking down at his hands that are fidgeting on his lap. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him move in so long. I visited him or his body everyday since the incident. Steve doesn\u2019t push or pressure me to go in he seems to be letting me go in when I\u2019m ready and I\u2019m extremely grateful for that.</p><p>I take a deep breath and open the glass door by the metal bar handle. For once I\u2019m grateful that the monitors and other equipment are in the other room. This means it\u2019s only Pietro and I in the room since Steve isn\u2019t coming in and went the the other room to check medical things with everyone else.</p><p>I stand next to the door rethinking my choice. Before I can escape without him noticing the door shuts making a soft noise that Pietro notices. His head darts up. When he sees me his whole demeanor changes. At first he seems extremely happy to see me, then relieved, then confused and finally sad or maybe guilty.</p><p>\u201cMay I come over?\u201d I ask trying to break the awkward silence. He just nods indicting that I can move towards him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to freak out, I just don\u2019t really trust that it\u2019s you. I mean you were gone I just don\u2019t understand how this could happen.\u201d I try to explain feeling guilt starting to drown me.</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to be sorry. I am the one who messed up. I am the one who did this.\u201d He says. He hasn\u2019t stopped moving since I first saw him. I feel tears sting my eyes again, but this time they are from being guilty and I have so much remorse for what I did.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say, so I do the only thing I can think to do; I hug him. He doesn\u2019t even seem to think. He immediately hugs me back as if we were meant to be like this, which maybe we were.</p><p>We pull back after what seemed like hours. This is the first time I really look at his face. His electric blue eyes are full of energy and light. His face is still pale but now it\u2019s just pale it\u2019s not dead person, no blood flow pale. His lips have color they are slightly pink and purple but they aren\u2019t just pale and lifeless. This is when I finally realize that what I was being told was and is true.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d I all I can say over the shock. </p><p>He then reply\u2019s with: </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see that coming?\u201d</p>",

They are on a mission and I\u2019m in the helicopter; back-up.</p><p>\u201cAnswer it please, oh and call me Morgan, please.\u201d No matter how many times I tell it to call me Morgan it just doesn\u2019t. \u201cHello dad. Need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, M. Yeah we do; we have an enhanced.\u201d He says. \u201cGive me two seconds, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>I run into the field and see Clint on the ground, shot, with Nat next to him. \u201cDo I need to bring your ass back to the copter or do I get the ass hat that did this to you?\"I ask him.</p><p>\"Get him. Oh and by the way he has super speed and said \u2018You didn\u2019t see that coming?\u2019 so use that when you get him.\u201d Says Clint. I smile and say \u201cWill do, Old Man!\u201d I then run off not wanting to hear him lie saying he\u2019s not old when he is. I run around until I see the enhanced.</p><p><i>Okay so best course of action is probably to run into him. </i>So of course that\u2019s what I do. I run into him at full speed making him fall to the ground on his back but I was ready; I just stand firm.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see that coming?\u201d I ask him as he\u2019s on the ground. \u201cKay, got speedy. What should I do with him?\u201d I ask over the intercoms that I couldn\u2019t hear while running. No one answers. <i>Of course you don\u2019t answer the girl with the super human, that makes total sense to me\u2026</i></p><p>Speedy gets up but I quickly grab his wrist so he can\u2019t run. He looks at me and I give him a smile. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Morgan. Since my fantastic team members aren\u2019t answering I\u2019ll be with you for a while; better get used to me.\u201d He doesn\u2019t respond, but he does look at me and I get to study his features a little. \u201cWait, it\u2019s you. Where\u2019s your sister?\u201d I look at him concerned. <i>What if we didn\u2019t get here in time to save her!?</i></p><p>\u201cHow do you know me or my sister?\u201d He asks, he has an accent.</p><p>\u201cWell, I see things and you and your sister, I\u2019ve been seeing you two a lot. Listen, I\u2019m like you. I\u2019ve been experimented on, it\u2019s how I got my powers; same with Steve; so I know what it\u2019s like. We don\u2019t want to hurt you, we want to put the guys who did this to you in jail; we don\u2019t even want to hurt them, but if we have to to get them behind bars then we are gonna. But, we don\u2019t want to hurt you so please don\u2019t hurt us. These guys are my family, they\u2019re all I got so please don\u2019t hurt them; you wouldn\u2019t like t if your sister got hurt and I don\u2019t like it when my family gets hurt either.\u201d He has a small smile on his face but it soon disappears. \u201cHow do I know you aren\u2019t lying?\u201d He asks. \u201cWell, for starters, your sisters name is Wanda, I believe. Your\u2019s is Pietro. You have super speed she has telekinetic powers. Yes?\u201d</p><p>Before he can answer I sense something. <i>He\u2019s in trouble!</i> I let go of Pietro and run to dad. When I do get there he\u2019s at the scepter but he seems to be in a trance, with Wanda behind him; she\u2019s doing it.</p><p>\u201cNot cool.\u201d I say in her direction. \u201cDad?\u201d No response. \u201cHello?\u201d<i> I\u2019m skipping all this stuff.</i> I slap him, but not too hard; it might still leave a bruise. He snaps out of it and grabs the scepter then leaves.</p><p>I huff a little. <i>Wow, you\u2019re welcome</i>. \u201cWow, that was real cool,\u201d I say sarcastically to Wanda who now has Pietro next to her. I wait or dramatic effect. \u201cWanda.\u201d I then speed out of that creepy place.</p><p>I get to the aircraft before dad. \u201cHello, everybody!\u201d I smile at everyone. Before they can even ask I inform them. \u201cDad got the scepter, but the girl used her powers on him so\u2026 yeah. Oh and the boys name is Pietro, he has super speed, and the girls name is Wanda, she has telekinetic powers. Pietro seems decent but Wanda I\u2019m not particularly fond of, for obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, the lullaby worked better than ever.\u201d Nat says after she gets Bruce\u2019s attention off of his opera music.</p><p>\u201cJust wasn\u2019t expecting the Code Green.\u201d He says a little frazzled. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been there, there would\u2019ve been double the casualties. My best friend would\u2019ve been a treasured memory.\u201d She says talking about Clint. \u201cYou know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn\u2019t exactly what I want to hear.\u201d \u201cHow long before you trust me?\u201d<br></p><p>They keep talking but it\u2019s all very boring so I put on my headphones and listen to some music; mostly musicals and some rock here and there. I pull out my <b><i>Kindle</i></b> and continue reading <b><i>Everything, Everything</i></b> by Nicola Yoon.</p><p>I look up and everyone is leaving the plane.</p><p>\u201cWow, thanks for telling me we landed.\u201d I remarked sarcastically, but no one even looks at me. That was a pretty good remark.</p><p>I get out of the aircraft and go into the tower to makes some tea and read a good book.</p><p>~~During the battle~~</p><p>I sit on the aircraft like I always do during the fun battles. I wait for everyone to come back from the fight with Ultron. Well that\u2019s before I get a vision of Clint shielding a child and then the sound of gun shots.</p><p>I look up and see people getting on; civilians. I run out and start looking for the place I saw from the vision.</p><p>As I the sight gets into view I hear a gun shot. My hand shoots up and I hope something would happen. I close my eyes tightly and hope something protected Clint and the child; I hope something shields them from the bullets. I feel something I can\u2019t really describe at that time. </p><p>I don\u2019t look till somebody puts a hand on my shoulder. <i>Please be a good guy. Please be a good guy. </i>I look behind me and see the Archer. I sigh in relief that he and the child are alright.</p><p>I flood him with a million questions. \u201cWhat happened? Are you alright? Did you get hurt? Where\u2019s the kid? Are they okay?\u201d He waits for me to stop. When I finally do he replies \u201cA shield type thing saved me and Pietro; he was gonna take the bullets and if you had been a millisecond later he\u2019d be all hole-y. I\u2019m fine. No I didn\u2019t get hurt, well from that. The kid went back to his mother. And he\u2019s fine.\u201d I look at him shocked. \u201cHow do you know it was me with the shield?\u201d \u201cWell you still find new powers so I guessed\u2026\u201d I look down at my hand and see a blue-green mist coming from it.</p><p>Speedster then basically appears in front of me. \u201cYou are okay?\u201d He asks like I could have gotten hurt when I was probably a good few feet away. \u201cI mean yeah, I felt\u2026 something. But yeah I\u2019m fine. Nothing injured, from that at least.\u201d I chuckle nervously trying to lighten the tension.</p><p>That of course didn\u2019t work. Both the boys still seemed worried and amazed. \u201cWell, we should get back.\u201d I tell them but this is the first time I looked at Pietro for more then a millisecond. \u201cYou- you have a- a bullet hole!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cWell, um, yes. But it will not hurt for long.\u201d He tries to calm me which worked as well as me trying to calm him. \u201cThat means it hurts. Go with Clint, don\u2019t get in trouble and find everyone else. I\u2019ll do a quick look over of the place,\u201d I look at both the boys and say this but then look only at Pietro \u201cAnd get that fixed up; wouldn\u2019t want you hole-y.\u201d I try and joke.</p><p>Before Clint can complain about me stealing his joke I run off to do a check of the area. I find Wanda with several 'dead\u2019 robot things around her (Ultron\u2019s team). She\u2019s sobbing like part of her died.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d I say carefully.</p><p>\u201cPietro, he\u2019s hurt or dead!\u201d She says between sobs, whimpers and shaky breath. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead! Don\u2019t worry he\u2019ll be fine. Just one bullet hit him, I saw him and the wound myself. He was gonna die to protect a child and Clint.\u201d I explain to her. \u201cHow- who- Why?!\u201d She says not knowing exactly what to ask first. \u201cIt was with a machine gun, Ultron or one of his goons and because he\u2019s on the other team?\u201d I say more of a question. \u201cIf it was in fact a machine gun, how is he not dead?\u201d She questions seeming happy yet curious. \u201cWell, um, I have these power, I guess, that just kinda pop up. I shielded him and Clint, or at least that\u2019s what Clint says is what happened.\u201d I try to play it cool; probably failing miserably.</p><p>She looks at me then walks up to me and hugs me. I hug her back rather awkwardly due to me not really knowing her or being a touchy-feely kind of person. She pulls away and says \u201cThank you, He is the only one I have left.\u201d I smile at her then say \u201cWell, yes and no. I\u2019m pretty sure you and your brother are Avengers now, so you have me and the team now. Trust me, the team will treat you like family; they always have with me at least, and I\u2019m sure you two will be no different.\u201d \u00a0I smile at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, we have to get back to leave this place ASAP!\u201d I tell her. She takes off flying (only a few inches off the ground) towards the aircraft. I soon follow suit but running instead of flying. But before we can even get there I feel as though my heart was ripped out in front of me and squeezed till every drop and ounce of blood has dripped out; and then it was forced back into my empty cavity of a chest.</p><p>I fall to my knees and quiver;not being able to to breathe. I know who it is that made me feel this way and why.</p><p>\u201cPietro\u2026\u201d Is all I can think to say. I look over to see Wanda on her knees doing the same a me. It seems we both know that something horrible happened to him.<i> I wasn\u2019t there to save him this time; I failed him, I might as well have killed him myself.</i></p><p>I put my hand on Wanda\u2019s shoulder to try and comfort her. Before I even know it she\u2019s hugging me and I her. I cry and walk back to the aircraft with Wanda right next to me; we don\u2019t need to say anything for her to know that we both loved him (yes, in different ways but still love and such).</p><p>We finally get back to everyone else, but before they can even ask me any questions I put my headphones on and close my eyes and listen to <b>'Not About Angels\u2019 </b>by <b>Birdy</b>\u2026 for the whole time to get to the tower\u2026 which probably isn\u2019t the best thing to do right now but I honestly couldn\u2019t care less at this point.</p><p>No one talked, they just looked at Wanda sympathetically and at me with confusion and sadness in their eyes. No one knew I liked him, I barely knew I liked him; but now I know that I loved him. Well at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing this newly found emotion is.</p><p>We land, I\u2019m the first one out and immediately go to my room. I keep my headphones and close the door, not even bothering to lock it, then flop on my bed. I have no tears to cry but it\u2019s like I can\u2019t feel anything but so much regret.</p><p><i>I ignored him, he tried to talk to me in the tower and I ignored him. How could I have done that? I only did that because he hurt my family and he said sorry god knows how many times. I denied my feelings and tried to make myself believe that I didn\u2019t like him. Now I can\u2019t even tell him, now he\u2019s gone and it\u2019s all my fault. I should have helped and saved him somehow. I should have been the one to die, it shouldn\u2019t have been him.</i></p><p>I stay in my room for weeks only ever coming out for meals or to go to the bathroom. I\u2019m not doing the one thing I would have killed to do at one point, fighting the bad guy; helping anyway I could. Everyone has come in a saw me; Steve, Clint, Nat, Bruce, everyone. My dad is trying his best but I can\u2019t get over this, I miss him so much. They are keeping his body in the lab, I have no clue as to why but they are.</p><p>At first my mind loved to play tricks on me; show me visions of him waking up or coming to see me or smile and eating in the kitchen with everyone. I would believe that he would wake up, but it never happened, he never woke up.</p><p>Then I went to the anger stage of grief and went to the gym and training room; I would punch anything I could, I would kick robot ass and I would work my ass off pushing myself to just destroy something. I would get irritated very easily. During this time we got a new member his name is Bucky or Buck or whatever stupid nickname Dad gave him.</p><p>I soon got to the bargaining stage. During this I would talk into the obis just hoping that there was a god or something that was able to bring him back or just let me see him one last time. At one point I asked Thor if he could do something, but he couldn\u2019t. I asked if there was a way for me to go back to that day, for me to die instead; still nothing. During this the Avengers fought, got two new member who\u2019s names are Peter or spider man or Spidey, and Bucky, or Buck, or the Winter Shoulder. then made up to fight a big baddie whom killed people I never met ( Drax, Wong and a Raccoon thing I think his name was Rocket).</p><p>So here I am, fighting my own battle with depression. But I\u2019ve gotten really good at pretending that I\u2019m fine and I\u2019ve gotten over it. Some people see through it (Stephen Strange, Wanda, Loki, Buck and Peter Quill). I\u2019ve gotten decently close with all the new guys, they all seem pretty decent and like an extended family. Wanda has gotten really close with Vision and they are even dating, which I\u2019m in full support of!</p><p>The people who see through my act have tried to help and all that but as much as they try I still am having trouble accepting the fact that I will never get Pietro back, that I\u2019ll never see him again. My dad, I think, subconsciously knows but just won\u2019t accept that I got hurt so much from this and the fact that I\u2019ve had such a hard time with his death. I think he just wants me to be the way I was. I\u2019ve gotten very close to Buck, Peter and Stephen. Turns out Buck was captured by HYDRA too so he helps me and I help him; plus he\u2019s as old as Steve and used to be friends with him so that\u2019s cool. Peter lost his mother and was adopted (kinda) by a blue dude who was super cool but sadly died and his actual dad tried to hypnotize him, kill all his friends and the galaxy and gave Peter\u2019s mom cancer. Stephen got in an accident and his hands got kinda messed up and now they shake a lot, but he used to be a surgeon and with his hands all shaky he had to stop and then he found that Wong guy who taught him magic and this cap he wears all the time is like basically a friend of his (still confused about the cape thing). But he lost a person he was in love with because of what happened so he helps me a lot with the whole Pietro situation.</p><p>I\u2019m still having trouble fully accepting all of what happened but I\u2019m getting closer and closer everyday. I\u2019m not as depressed as I was so I can genuinely be happy once and a while and I\u2019ve stopped isolating. Turns out the new people on the team are really cool. Plus, Loki\u2019s back!</p><p>Today is sadly my birthday and no I am not exactly excited about it. I hate my birthday with a passion of a thousand suns. I don\u2019t want gifts, I don\u2019t want cake, don\u2019t want candles and I don\u2019t want today to be different then any other day, meaning I don\u2019t want something special to happen. But with my family something will happen. I know that some of them will get me a gift because they all but tortured me to tell them what I want; I finally broke and told them I want shirts that will remind me of them.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, birthday girl!\u201d My dad practically yelled after he woke my up and I forced myself to open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to make a big deal. So what? Oh, wow, I haven\u2019t died yet and I\u2019m one year older; big whoop.\u201d I remark being as sarcastic as possible. \u201cWell we have to celebrate. Everyone is too excited for you for us not to celebrate!\u201d I groan at my dad\u2019s remark but get up anyways.</p><p>I follow my dad to the dining room; not even bothering to change out of my plain white t-shirt and fuzzy pajama pants that resemble a blue poodle skirt. I get into the informal dining room and see everyone there; except for T'Challa who is back in Wakanda and Spidey who is probably with his Aunt at home.</p><p>\u201cHey guys! Look M&amp;M is finally awake!\u201d Buck belted getting everyone\u2019s attention. He\u2019s normally not one to draw attention or be loud so this sudden loud outburst kind of surprises me. I roll my eyes at him but can\u2019t help but smile due to the nickname.</p><p>\u201cSo can I have breakfast or do I have to do something amazing because it\u2019s my birthday?\u201d</p><p>Before I can even sit down Clint says \u201cWell, a hand stand into a somersault followed by a pose would be pretty cool.\u201d I groan but sit at the breakfast bar next to Wanda. \u201cSo how you doing, Buckaroo, Bird Brain?\u201d I ask Buck and Clint with a smirk.</p><p>Then Stephen starts to give everyone breakfast; my favorite, waffles with mashed up strawberries, hash browns and orange juice. Even my dog, Tonks, runs up to me and licks my hand. \u201cHey Tonks!\u201d I say in a happy voice. \u201cWait, why does the dog get a happy face when she says happy birthday?\u201d Clint asks. \u201cBecause, Old Man, Tonks is much cuter then any of you.\u201d I reply making sure to push one of his several buttons that annoy him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why we got you that dog?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cNo, Capsicle, enlighten me.\u201d I tell him in response. \u201cWell, after 'Civil War\u2019, as you like to call it, all of us,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones that were part of it.\u201d Wanda clarifies. \u201cChipped in and got Tonks for you, basically as a thank you of sorts.\u201d Steve continues.</p><p>I stare at him and raise an eyebrow. \u201cWell, in that fight you all must have hit your head pretty hard to think that you need to thank me. I didn\u2019t fight in it remember.\u201d I say rather bluntly. \u00a0\"Well, technically, no you didn\u2019t. But you listened to all of us and our point of view. Plus you helped Bucky when we all came back together to fight again.\u201c Steve tells me.</p><p>\"Hell yeah she did.\u201d Bucky pipes up. And then pats my back. \u201cWell, how could I not? He\u2019s basically a lost puppy!\u201d I say then send a smirk his way to which he pretends to be offended which makes me stick out my tongue at him like a child.</p><p>After this we all eat and chat like usual. But then what I feared would happen happened; everyone slowly started to pull out bags or wrapped gifts out for under their seats.</p><p>I groan and then say \u201cWhy do you guys love to torture me? You\u2019re supposed to be the good guys!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a pretty simple reason really, it\u2019s because it\u2019s hilarious.\u201d Responses Loki. I roll my eyes. \u201cIf I get anything other than a shirt or sweatshirt or something I might have to kill all of you, and I will not hesitate.\u201d I tell them.</p><p>Once everyone is done eating I decided to just get it over with. I open each present rather fast even though I do like all of the shirts.</p><p>Dad got me an iron man shirt that was basically just a picture of his suit on a shirt. Steve got me a shirt that had and older picture of him in his suit that said 'I want YOU\u2019 then the picture of him and then on the bottom it continued with 'to WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE NOW\u2019. Thor got me a shirt with a his hammer on it in a circle. Nat got me a shirt that looked like the top part of her suit. Clint got me a white shirt with 'I\u2019 then a heart with an arrow in it the underneath it said 'Hawkeye\u2019. Bruce got me a shirt that had the hulk\u2019s figure in green then in front of it was a smaller man\u2019s figure whom was Bruce. Pepper said she couldn\u2019t find anything like her so she got me a grey shirt with fake rips on them that reviled the iron man chest. Bucky got me a sweatshirt with his metal arm printed on it. Stephen got me a black shirt that said 'Dormammu\u2019 then his cape and inside that it said 'I\u2019ve come to bargain\u2019. Peter (Quill) gave me one of his shirts that had some alien language on it but it kinda looked like it said 'Yeah Baby\u2019. Wanda gave me a red shirt that had her on it and said 'Scarlet Witch\u2019 on it. T'calla sent me a sweatshirt that looked like his suit with his necklace. Loki gave me a shirt with a really cute almost babyish version of him in his 'suit\u2019 and it said 'Kneel before me!!!\u2019. Spidey gave me a shirt with his masked face as a bunch of emotions. Scott gave me a shirt that looked like his Ant-Man suit. Vision gave me a shirt that looked like his cape. Rhodey gave me a shirt that looked like his suit. Sam gave me what he looks like in the same babyish style as Loki\u2019s in his suit. Nebula gave me a shirt with the nebula on it. Mantis gave me a shirt with her on it and the word 'Mantis\u2019 on it. Glamora gave me a shirt with her face on it as a wanted poster. Groot gave me a white shirt with a chest pocket that made it look like he was half in it and half out.</p><p>\u201cAw guys, this is so sweet; and you all actually listened to me for once!\u201d I tease at the end.</p><p>\u201cThere is one more gift.\u201d Wanda says. She pulls out a bag with a cloud design on it. I look at her questioningly but pull out the contents of the bag anyways. It\u2019s what looks like Pietro\u2019s old shirt. My breath hitches at the sight. \u201cIt\u2019s one of Pietro\u2019s old shirts. I figured you would like one.\u201d Wanda stats. I look at her \u201cI don\u2019t need this. You already gave me one of his blankets.\u201d She then smiles at me. \u201cI know you don\u2019t need it, but I want you to have it; Pietro would want you to have it.\u201d I get up and go to hug her and she soon copies. I whisper in her ear \u201cThank you.\u201d She whispers back \u201cNo problem, you deserve it.\u201d</p><p>We break apart and I look at all the shirts taking in every detail. <i>I am so lucky to have all these amazing people in my life; I love them all so much. </i>I end up looking just at Pietro\u2019s old one.</p><p>I snap myself out of my thoughts. \u201cWell I should go get changed into actual clothes.\u201d I announce to everyone.</p><p>\u201cWear one of the shirts!\u201d Peter says excited. \u201cI am Groot!\u201d Groot agrees. \u201cI was planning on it.\u201d I respond. Then everyone starts to argue about who\u2019s shirt I should put on. I roll my eyes for the hundredth time today and walk to my room to get changed.</p><p>I end up putting on Pietro\u2019s old shirt, which is rather tight in the chest area, some old ripped up plain jeans and some sea foam green Converse. I put my hair up into a high ponytail. I don\u2019t bother to put on makeup because I am way too lazy to really ever do that; it\u2019s just gonna get messed up anyways. I put on a Doctor Who bracelet and a small rose gold bracelet that says 'Stay Strong\u2019 engraved on it. But finally I put on a silver crown ring on I got from an unknown person on my birthday before the last fight with Ultron.</p><p>I pick up the book I\u2019m reading, for the hundredth and tenth time, <b><i>Let It Snow</i></b> by John Green, Lauren Myracle and Maureen Johnson.</p><p>Before I leave me room I say something to 'Pietro\u2019 or nothingness, still not sure which. \u201cHey, I miss you, a lot. I miss you all the time. Every second. And I want you to know I don\u2019t blame you for what happened, I don\u2019t think I ever will.\u201d</p><p>I walk out of my room and down the hall to the elevator. I get in and go down to the main level so I can leave the tower and go to my favorite place in the world, the book store down the street.</p><p>Before I can reach the door I hear Wanda say telepathically \u201cWait for me. I will be down in one moment.\u201d I do as she says and wait by the door for her and, like she said, she is down soon there after.</p><p>\u201cCan I go with you to the bookstore?\u201d She asks me like I would ever say no to her company. \u201cYeah, of course!\u201d I reply without missing a beat. \u201cShall we?\u201d I ask her and gesture to the door. \u201cWe shall.\u201d She says linking her arm with mine.</p><p>Once we get to the bookstore our paths part. I go and look around at all the books and merchandise for some of the books. I read the back of one which catches my attention. It\u2019s called <b><i>To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before </i></b>by Jenny Han. I sit down at a booth they have by a coffee, tea and some pastries bar type thing.</p><p>I order my mint tea and blueberry muffin then hear Wanda\u2019s voice in my head. \u201cI apparently need to go back to the Tower. I am sorry, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Is all she said before I heard the bell on the door chime signaling someone was entering or exiting.</p><p>I start to read taking a bite of my muffin or a sip of my tea here and there; until I hear Wanda\u2019s voice \u201cYou should come back to the Tower as soon as you can.\u201d The bell didn\u2019t ring so I know she\u2019s not actually here. This mind thing still doesn\u2019t make sense to me.</p><p>She said as soon as I can so I get the feeling it\u2019s urgent. I run back to the Tower using my speed powers, even though it\u2019s just a few minute walk meaning it\u2019s probably less then a millisecond run at super speed. I run in the door and use powers to feel where they are. I run to the lab and see everyone standing around a table. \u201cWhat is it? Is everyone okay?!\u201d I ask suddenly getting an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and guilt for not being here if something happened.</p><p>\u201cWell everyone is okay, even some people we thought weren\u2019t.\u201d Bruce says seeming to be very cautious. I feel my eyebrows furrow together in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask felling something bad is about to happen; like how I feel before a fight breaks out.</p><p>Before anyone can answer I feel a slight wind and a hand on my back; no one was behind me. My breathing goes faster. It\u2019s one of two things. Either some villain evil guy got in and is gonna kill me or the thing that\u2019s okay is Pietro, which seems impossible but weirder things have happened before with this family. I feel a chill run down my spine even thinking about Pietro being alive and breathing again.</p><p>\u201cHello\u2026\u201d I hear something that sounds like Pietro. But that\u2019s impossible, even for us. There is no way a dead person can come back to life, absolutely no way.</p><p>My eyes flicker between Bruce and my father at a rapid pace; barely enough time for me to even see them. \u201cWhy?\u201d Is all I can think to say. <i>Why would they make a thing that sounds like him!? Did they think this would help Me and Wanda!?</i> A million other thoughts race through my mind at a mile a second. They look at me even more confused then they already where.</p><p>Before I can even think about anything else to say a Pietro lookalike is standing in front of me. \u201cI have missed you.\u201d Is all it says. I look at it not wanting to show any emotion but my nose betrays me by twitching in anger. I don\u2019t take my eyes of the presumed robot. \u201cHow could you!? Did you think this would help me!? 'Yeah lets make a robot of Pietro to help Morgan and Wanda! That\u2019s a great idea!\u2019\u201d I use a dumb sounding voice at the end to imitate them. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The robot asks looking rather hurt. \u201cWhat did you use to make it have thoughts and emotions? I get how you did it with Vision but how did you do it with this?\u201d I ask sounding startling calm even to me. But before they can even think about what I just said I spit out \u201cKnow what? I don\u2019t want to know! I\u2019ll be in my room, don\u2019t bother me unless it is absolutely necessary.\u201d I say then storm out of the room not even bothering to look back even slightly.</p><p>Hot tears sting my eyes and fall down my heated, no doubtably reddened face. I\u2019m so angry that I can barely control my own powers. All I can think about is how they could do that. I\u2019m Tony\u2019s niece who I thought he considered a daughter yet he had the brilliant idea to do this or help do this.</p><p>I get to my room, shut my door with a loud thud and slam my body onto my bed wanting to scream, cry, and punch all at the same time. I wrap myself in the mint blue blanket that Wanda gave me of Pietro\u2019s. Between the shirt and the blanket it smells and feels like Pietro is here with me, here living again. I don\u2019t bother to hold back anymore; I sob.</p><p>I end up talk to nothingness again hoping that somewhere Pietro can hear, even if it\u2019s in a different universe. \u201cHow much longer do I need to fake being happy? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be whole again. I lost the one person I never knew I needed, how ironic is that. I want you back. I don\u2019t want to cry anymore, I don\u2019t want to fake happy, I don\u2019t want to forget you and I don\u2019t want to have to fight to stay okay anymore. I still love everything about you, Pietro. The only thing I don\u2019t love about you is the fact you aren\u2019t with me. I feel less empty then I was but I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling kinda okay. I mean I\u2019m mad and sad but I don\u2019t know, what if that was-\u201d I cut myself off. \u201cNo that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>I hear a knock on my door. I\u2019m not okay but I\u2019m not showing that to everyone else. It honestly hurts a lot, but I\u2019m gonna keep it inside and to myself so it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone else.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m not ready to see dad or Bruce.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Steve.\u201d Say the voice that belongs to Steve on the other said of the door. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He opens the door and comes inside. But he doesn\u2019t shut the door behind him. I sit up on my bed so he has a place to sit. He does sit, next to me.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t talk for a moment or two. \u201cI know this is tough. I kind of went through it with Bucky so I sort of know how your feeling on some level.\u201d He takes a deep breath and I assume he\u2019s planning out his next words; this makes me have a feeling I\u2019m not going to like what he\u2019s going to say. \u201cI know this is gonna be tough to hear but it\u2019s him, and before you get defensive or upset just hear me out. Even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s him isn\u2019t it worth a shot to see if it is, I mean seriously. We all noticed how upset you got after everything happened that day. Plus if it\u2019s him I mean think about how much he\u2019s missed out on, he\u2019s gonna need a friendly face. I\u2019m not gonna say I know for sure it\u2019s him but even Wanda thinks it is. So if there is any chance it\u2019s him, I suggest you take it. If it\u2019s not him and you get even slightly hurt I will owe you so so much and you can completely blame me.\u201d He finishes and he seems to wait for my answer.</p><p>It takes me a while to think over everything he said but I do eventually come to a conclusion. I nod seeming to get the message to him that I\u2019m going to take the chance that it might be him.</p><p>He gets up and I follow having to focus on what I\u2019m doing just to get my legs to move. Steve doesn\u2019t even give me a chance to rethink before he takes my shoulder in his hand lightly and directs me to where Pietro is.</p><p>We get to the lab and see the silver haired boy looking down at his hands that are fidgeting on his lap. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him move in so long. I visited him or his body everyday since the incident. Steve doesn\u2019t push or pressure me to go in he seems to be letting me go in when I\u2019m ready and I\u2019m extremely grateful for that.</p><p>I take a deep breath and open the glass door by the metal bar handle. For once I\u2019m grateful that the monitors and other equipment are in the other room. This means it\u2019s only Pietro and I in the room since Steve isn\u2019t coming in and went the the other room to check medical things with everyone else.</p><p>I stand next to the door rethinking my choice. Before I can escape without him noticing the door shuts making a soft noise that Pietro notices. His head darts up. When he sees me his whole demeanor changes. At first he seems extremely happy to see me, then relieved, then confused and finally sad or maybe guilty.</p><p>\u201cMay I come over?\u201d I ask trying to break the awkward silence. He just nods indicting that I can move towards him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to freak out, I just don\u2019t really trust that it\u2019s you. I mean you were gone I just don\u2019t understand how this could happen.\u201d I try to explain feeling guilt starting to drown me.</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to be sorry. I am the one who messed up. I am the one who did this.\u201d He says. He hasn\u2019t stopped moving since I first saw him. I feel tears sting my eyes again, but this time they are from being guilty and I have so much remorse for what I did.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say, so I do the only thing I can think to do; I hug him. He doesn\u2019t even seem to think. He immediately hugs me back as if we were meant to be like this, which maybe we were.</p><p>We pull back after what seemed like hours. This is the first time I really look at his face. His electric blue eyes are full of energy and light. His face is still pale but now it\u2019s just pale it\u2019s not dead person, no blood flow pale. His lips have color they are slightly pink and purple but they aren\u2019t just pale and lifeless. This is when I finally realize that what I was being told was and is true.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d I all I can say over the shock. </p><p>He then reply\u2019s with: </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see that coming?\u201d</p>",

I smile and say &ldquo;Will do, Old Man!&rdquo; I then run off not wanting to hear him lie saying he&rsquo;s not old when he is. I run around until I see the enhanced.</p><p><i>Okay so best course of action is probably to run into him. </i>So of course that&rsquo;s what I do. I run into him at full speed making him fall to the ground on his back but I was ready; I just stand firm.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see that coming?&rdquo; I ask him as he&rsquo;s on the ground. &ldquo;Kay, got speedy. What should I do with him?&rdquo; I ask over the intercoms that I couldn&rsquo;t hear while running. No one answers. <i>Of course you don&rsquo;t answer the girl with the super human, that makes total sense to me&hellip;</i></p><p>Speedy gets up but I quickly grab his wrist so he can&rsquo;t run. He looks at me and I give him a smile. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Morgan. Since my fantastic team members aren&rsquo;t answering I&rsquo;ll be with you for a while; better get used to me.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t respond, but he does look at me and I get to study his features a little. &ldquo;Wait, it&rsquo;s you. Where&rsquo;s your sister?&rdquo; I look at him concerned. <i>What if we didn&rsquo;t get here in time to save her!?</i></p><p>&ldquo;How do you know me or my sister?&rdquo; He asks, he has an accent.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I see things and you and your sister, I&rsquo;ve been seeing you two a lot. Listen, I&rsquo;m like you. I&rsquo;ve been experimented on, it&rsquo;s how I got my powers; same with Steve; so I know what it&rsquo;s like. We don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, we want to put the guys who did this to you in jail; we don&rsquo;t even want to hurt them, but if we have to to get them behind bars then we are gonna. But, we don&rsquo;t want to hurt you so please don&rsquo;t hurt us. These guys are my family, they&rsquo;re all I got so please don&rsquo;t hurt them; you wouldn&rsquo;t like t if your sister got hurt and I don&rsquo;t like it when my family gets hurt either.&rdquo; He has a small smile on his face but it soon disappears. &ldquo;How do I know you aren&rsquo;t lying?&rdquo; He asks. &ldquo;Well, for starters, your sisters name is Wanda, I believe. Your&rsquo;s is Pietro. You have super speed she has telekinetic powers. Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>Before he can answer I sense something. <i>He&rsquo;s in trouble!</i> I let go of Pietro and run to dad. When I do get there he&rsquo;s at the scepter but he seems to be in a trance, with Wanda behind him; she&rsquo;s doing it.</p><p>&ldquo;Not cool.&rdquo; I say in her direction. &ldquo;Dad?&rdquo; No response. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;<i> I&rsquo;m skipping all this stuff.</i> I slap him, but not too hard; it might still leave a bruise. He snaps out of it and grabs the scepter then leaves.</p><p>I huff a little. <i>Wow, you&rsquo;re welcome</i>. &ldquo;Wow, that was real cool,&rdquo; I say sarcastically to Wanda who now has Pietro next to her. I wait or dramatic effect. &ldquo;Wanda.&rdquo; I then speed out of that creepy place.</p><p>I get to the aircraft before dad. &ldquo;Hello, everybody!&rdquo; I smile at everyone. Before they can even ask I inform them. &ldquo;Dad got the scepter, but the girl used her powers on him so&hellip; yeah. Oh and the boys name is Pietro, he has super speed, and the girls name is Wanda, she has telekinetic powers. Pietro seems decent but Wanda I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of, for obvious reasons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.&rdquo; Nat says after she gets Bruce&rsquo;s attention off of his opera music.</p><p>&ldquo;Just wasn&rsquo;t expecting the Code Green.&rdquo; He says a little frazzled. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been there, there would&rsquo;ve been double the casualties. My best friend would&rsquo;ve been a treasured memory.&rdquo; She says talking about Clint. &ldquo;You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn&rsquo;t exactly what I want to hear.&rdquo; &ldquo;How long before you trust me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>They keep talking but it&rsquo;s all very boring so I put on my headphones and listen to some music; mostly musicals and some rock here and there. I pull out my <b><i>Kindle</i></b> and continue reading <b><i>Everything, Everything</i></b> by Nicola Yoon.</p><p>I look up and everyone is leaving the plane.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, thanks for telling me we landed.&rdquo; I remarked sarcastically, but no one even looks at me. That was a pretty good remark.</p><p>I get out of the aircraft and go into the tower to makes some tea and read a good book.</p><p>~~During the battle~~</p><p>I sit on the aircraft like I always do during the fun battles. I wait for everyone to come back from the fight with Ultron. Well that&rsquo;s before I get a vision of Clint shielding a child and then the sound of gun shots.</p><p>I look up and see people getting on; civilians. I run out and start looking for the place I saw from the vision.</p><p>As I the sight gets into view I hear a gun shot. My hand shoots up and I hope something would happen. I close my eyes tightly and hope something protected Clint and the child; I hope something shields them from the bullets. I feel something I can&rsquo;t really describe at that time. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t look till somebody puts a hand on my shoulder. <i>Please be a good guy. Please be a good guy. </i>I look behind me and see the Archer. I sigh in relief that he and the child are alright.</p><p>I flood him with a million questions. &ldquo;What happened? Are you alright? Did you get hurt? Where&rsquo;s the kid? Are they okay?&rdquo; He waits for me to stop. When I finally do he replies &ldquo;A shield type thing saved me and Pietro; he was gonna take the bullets and if you had been a millisecond later he&rsquo;d be all hole-y. I&rsquo;m fine. No I didn&rsquo;t get hurt, well from that. The kid went back to his mother. And he&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; I look at him shocked. &ldquo;How do you know it was me with the shield?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well you still find new powers so I guessed&hellip;&rdquo; I look down at my hand and see a blue-green mist coming from it.</p><p>Speedster then basically appears in front of me. &ldquo;You are okay?&rdquo; He asks like I could have gotten hurt when I was probably a good few feet away. &ldquo;I mean yeah, I felt&hellip; something. But yeah I&rsquo;m fine. Nothing injured, from that at least.&rdquo; I chuckle nervously trying to lighten the tension.</p><p>That of course didn&rsquo;t work. Both the boys still seemed worried and amazed. &ldquo;Well, we should get back.&rdquo; I tell them but this is the first time I looked at Pietro for more then a millisecond. &ldquo;You- you have a- a bullet hole!&rdquo; I exclaim.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, um, yes. But it will not hurt for long.&rdquo; He tries to calm me which worked as well as me trying to calm him. &ldquo;That means it hurts. Go with Clint, don&rsquo;t get in trouble and find everyone else. I&rsquo;ll do a quick look over of the place,&rdquo; I look at both the boys and say this but then look only at Pietro &ldquo;And get that fixed up; wouldn&rsquo;t want you hole-y.&rdquo; I try and joke.</p><p>Before Clint can complain about me stealing his joke I run off to do a check of the area. I find Wanda with several 'dead&rsquo; robot things around her (Ultron&rsquo;s team). She&rsquo;s sobbing like part of her died.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; I say carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Pietro, he&rsquo;s hurt or dead!&rdquo; She says between sobs, whimpers and shaky breath. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dead! Don&rsquo;t worry he&rsquo;ll be fine. Just one bullet hit him, I saw him and the wound myself. He was gonna die to protect a child and Clint.&rdquo; I explain to her. &ldquo;How- who- Why?!&rdquo; She says not knowing exactly what to ask first. &ldquo;It was with a machine gun, Ultron or one of his goons and because he&rsquo;s on the other team?&rdquo; I say more of a question. &ldquo;If it was in fact a machine gun, how is he not dead?&rdquo; She questions seeming happy yet curious. &ldquo;Well, um, I have these power, I guess, that just kinda pop up. I shielded him and Clint, or at least that&rsquo;s what Clint says is what happened.&rdquo; I try to play it cool; probably failing miserably.</p><p>She looks at me then walks up to me and hugs me. I hug her back rather awkwardly due to me not really knowing her or being a touchy-feely kind of person. She pulls away and says &ldquo;Thank you, He is the only one I have left.&rdquo; I smile at her then say &ldquo;Well, yes and no. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you and your brother are Avengers now, so you have me and the team now. Trust me, the team will treat you like family; they always have with me at least, and I&rsquo;m sure you two will be no different.&rdquo; &nbsp;I smile at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, we have to get back to leave this place ASAP!&rdquo; I tell her. She takes off flying (only a few inches off the ground) towards the aircraft. I soon follow suit but running instead of flying. But before we can even get there I feel as though my heart was ripped out in front of me and squeezed till every drop and ounce of blood has dripped out; and then it was forced back into my empty cavity of a chest.</p><p>I fall to my knees and quiver;not being able to to breathe. I know who it is that made me feel this way and why.</p><p>&ldquo;Pietro&hellip;&rdquo; Is all I can think to say. I look over to see Wanda on her knees doing the same a me. It seems we both know that something horrible happened to him.<i> I wasn&rsquo;t there to save him this time; I failed him, I might as well have killed him myself.</i></p><p>I put my hand on Wanda&rsquo;s shoulder to try and comfort her. Before I even know it she&rsquo;s hugging me and I her. I cry and walk back to the aircraft with Wanda right next to me; we don&rsquo;t need to say anything for her to know that we both loved him (yes, in different ways but still love and such).</p><p>We finally get back to everyone else, but before they can even ask me any questions I put my headphones on and close my eyes and listen to <b>'Not About Angels&rsquo; </b>by <b>Birdy</b>&hellip; for the whole time to get to the tower&hellip; which probably isn&rsquo;t the best thing to do right now but I honestly couldn&rsquo;t care less at this point.</p><p>No one talked, they just looked at Wanda sympathetically and at me with confusion and sadness in their eyes. No one knew I liked him, I barely knew I liked him; but now I know that I loved him. Well at least that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m guessing this newly found emotion is.</p><p>We land, I&rsquo;m the first one out and immediately go to my room. I keep my headphones and close the door, not even bothering to lock it, then flop on my bed. I have no tears to cry but it&rsquo;s like I can&rsquo;t feel anything but so much regret.</p><p><i>I ignored him, he tried to talk to me in the tower and I ignored him. How could I have done that? I only did that because he hurt my family and he said sorry god knows how many times. I denied my feelings and tried to make myself believe that I didn&rsquo;t like him. Now I can&rsquo;t even tell him, now he&rsquo;s gone and it&rsquo;s all my fault. I should have helped and saved him somehow. I should have been the one to die, it shouldn&rsquo;t have been him.</i></p><p>I stay in my room for weeks only ever coming out for meals or to go to the bathroom. I&rsquo;m not doing the one thing I would have killed to do at one point, fighting the bad guy; helping anyway I could. Everyone has come in a saw me; Steve, Clint, Nat, Bruce, everyone. My dad is trying his best but I can&rsquo;t get over this, I miss him so much. They are keeping his body in the lab, I have no clue as to why but they are.</p><p>At first my mind loved to play tricks on me; show me visions of him waking up or coming to see me or smile and eating in the kitchen with everyone. I would believe that he would wake up, but it never happened, he never woke up.</p><p>Then I went to the anger stage of grief and went to the gym and training room; I would punch anything I could, I would kick robot ass and I would work my ass off pushing myself to just destroy something. I would get irritated very easily. During this time we got a new member his name is Bucky or Buck or whatever stupid nickname Dad gave him.</p><p>I soon got to the bargaining stage. During this I would talk into the obis just hoping that there was a god or something that was able to bring him back or just let me see him one last time. At one point I asked Thor if he could do something, but he couldn&rsquo;t. I asked if there was a way for me to go back to that day, for me to die instead; still nothing. During this the Avengers fought, got two new member who&rsquo;s names are Peter or spider man or Spidey, and Bucky, or Buck, or the Winter Shoulder. then made up to fight a big baddie whom killed people I never met ( Drax, Wong and a Raccoon thing I think his name was Rocket).</p><p>So here I am, fighting my own battle with depression. But I&rsquo;ve gotten really good at pretending that I&rsquo;m fine and I&rsquo;ve gotten over it. Some people see through it (Stephen Strange, Wanda, Loki, Buck and Peter Quill). I&rsquo;ve gotten decently close with all the new guys, they all seem pretty decent and like an extended family. Wanda has gotten really close with Vision and they are even dating, which I&rsquo;m in full support of!</p><p>The people who see through my act have tried to help and all that but as much as they try I still am having trouble accepting the fact that I will never get Pietro back, that I&rsquo;ll never see him again. My dad, I think, subconsciously knows but just won&rsquo;t accept that I got hurt so much from this and the fact that I&rsquo;ve had such a hard time with his death. I think he just wants me to be the way I was. I&rsquo;ve gotten very close to Buck, Peter and Stephen. Turns out Buck was captured by HYDRA too so he helps me and I help him; plus he&rsquo;s as old as Steve and used to be friends with him so that&rsquo;s cool. Peter lost his mother and was adopted (kinda) by a blue dude who was super cool but sadly died and his actual dad tried to hypnotize him, kill all his friends and the galaxy and gave Peter&rsquo;s mom cancer. Stephen got in an accident and his hands got kinda messed up and now they shake a lot, but he used to be a surgeon and with his hands all shaky he had to stop and then he found that Wong guy who taught him magic and this cap he wears all the time is like basically a friend of his (still confused about the cape thing). But he lost a person he was in love with because of what happened so he helps me a lot with the whole Pietro situation.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still having trouble fully accepting all of what happened but I&rsquo;m getting closer and closer everyday. I&rsquo;m not as depressed as I was so I can genuinely be happy once and a while and I&rsquo;ve stopped isolating. Turns out the new people on the team are really cool. Plus, Loki&rsquo;s back!</p><p>Today is sadly my birthday and no I am not exactly excited about it. I hate my birthday with a passion of a thousand suns. I don&rsquo;t want gifts, I don&rsquo;t want cake, don&rsquo;t want candles and I don&rsquo;t want today to be different then any other day, meaning I don&rsquo;t want something special to happen. But with my family something will happen. I know that some of them will get me a gift because they all but tortured me to tell them what I want; I finally broke and told them I want shirts that will remind me of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, birthday girl!&rdquo; My dad practically yelled after he woke my up and I forced myself to open my eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you not to make a big deal. So what? Oh, wow, I haven&rsquo;t died yet and I&rsquo;m one year older; big whoop.&rdquo; I remark being as sarcastic as possible. &ldquo;Well we have to celebrate. Everyone is too excited for you for us not to celebrate!&rdquo; I groan at my dad&rsquo;s remark but get up anyways.</p><p>I follow my dad to the dining room; not even bothering to change out of my plain white t-shirt and fuzzy pajama pants that resemble a blue poodle skirt. I get into the informal dining room and see everyone there; except for T'Challa who is back in Wakanda and Spidey who is probably with his Aunt at home.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys! Look M&amp;M is finally awake!&rdquo; Buck belted getting everyone&rsquo;s attention. He&rsquo;s normally not one to draw attention or be loud so this sudden loud outburst kind of surprises me. I roll my eyes at him but can&rsquo;t help but smile due to the nickname.</p><p>&ldquo;So can I have breakfast or do I have to do something amazing because it&rsquo;s my birthday?&rdquo;</p><p>Before I can even sit down Clint says &ldquo;Well, a hand stand into a somersault followed by a pose would be pretty cool.&rdquo; I groan but sit at the breakfast bar next to Wanda. &ldquo;So how you doing, Buckaroo, Bird Brain?&rdquo; I ask Buck and Clint with a smirk.</p><p>Then Stephen starts to give everyone breakfast; my favorite, waffles with mashed up strawberries, hash browns and orange juice. Even my dog, Tonks, runs up to me and licks my hand. &ldquo;Hey Tonks!&rdquo; I say in a happy voice. &ldquo;Wait, why does the dog get a happy face when she says happy birthday?&rdquo; Clint asks. &ldquo;Because, Old Man, Tonks is much cuter then any of you.&rdquo; I reply making sure to push one of his several buttons that annoy him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know why we got you that dog?&rdquo; Steve asks. &ldquo;No, Capsicle, enlighten me.&rdquo; I tell him in response. &ldquo;Well, after 'Civil War&rsquo;, as you like to call it, all of us,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The ones that were part of it.&rdquo; Wanda clarifies. &ldquo;Chipped in and got Tonks for you, basically as a thank you of sorts.&rdquo; Steve continues.</p><p>I stare at him and raise an eyebrow. &ldquo;Well, in that fight you all must have hit your head pretty hard to think that you need to thank me. I didn&rsquo;t fight in it remember.&rdquo; I say rather bluntly. &nbsp;\"Well, technically, no you didn&rsquo;t. But you listened to all of us and our point of view. Plus you helped Bucky when we all came back together to fight again.&ldquo; Steve tells me.</p><p>\"Hell yeah she did.&rdquo; Bucky pipes up. And then pats my back. &ldquo;Well, how could I not? He&rsquo;s basically a lost puppy!&rdquo; I say then send a smirk his way to which he pretends to be offended which makes me stick out my tongue at him like a child.</p><p>After this we all eat and chat like usual. But then what I feared would happen happened; everyone slowly started to pull out bags or wrapped gifts out for under their seats.</p><p>I groan and then say &ldquo;Why do you guys love to torture me? You&rsquo;re supposed to be the good guys!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a pretty simple reason really, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s hilarious.&rdquo; Responses Loki. I roll my eyes. &ldquo;If I get anything other than a shirt or sweatshirt or something I might have to kill all of you, and I will not hesitate.&rdquo; I tell them.</p><p>Once everyone is done eating I decided to just get it over with. I open each present rather fast even though I do like all of the shirts.</p><p>Dad got me an iron man shirt that was basically just a picture of his suit on a shirt. Steve got me a shirt that had and older picture of him in his suit that said 'I want YOU&rsquo; then the picture of him and then on the bottom it continued with 'to WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE NOW&rsquo;. Thor got me a shirt with a his hammer on it in a circle. Nat got me a shirt that looked like the top part of her suit. Clint got me a white shirt with 'I&rsquo; then a heart with an arrow in it the underneath it said 'Hawkeye&rsquo;. Bruce got me a shirt that had the hulk&rsquo;s figure in green then in front of it was a smaller man&rsquo;s figure whom was Bruce. Pepper said she couldn&rsquo;t find anything like her so she got me a grey shirt with fake rips on them that reviled the iron man chest. Bucky got me a sweatshirt with his metal arm printed on it. Stephen got me a black shirt that said 'Dormammu&rsquo; then his cape and inside that it said 'I&rsquo;ve come to bargain&rsquo;. Peter (Quill) gave me one of his shirts that had some alien language on it but it kinda looked like it said 'Yeah Baby&rsquo;. Wanda gave me a red shirt that had her on it and said 'Scarlet Witch&rsquo; on it. T'calla sent me a sweatshirt that looked like his suit with his necklace. Loki gave me a shirt with a really cute almost babyish version of him in his 'suit&rsquo; and it said 'Kneel before me!!!&rsquo;. Spidey gave me a shirt with his masked face as a bunch of emotions. Scott gave me a shirt that looked like his Ant-Man suit. Vision gave me a shirt that looked like his cape. Rhodey gave me a shirt that looked like his suit. Sam gave me what he looks like in the same babyish style as Loki&rsquo;s in his suit. Nebula gave me a shirt with the nebula on it. Mantis gave me a shirt with her on it and the word 'Mantis&rsquo; on it. Glamora gave me a shirt with her face on it as a wanted poster. Groot gave me a white shirt with a chest pocket that made it look like he was half in it and half out.</p><p>&ldquo;Aw guys, this is so sweet; and you all actually listened to me for once!&rdquo; I tease at the end.</p><p>&ldquo;There is one more gift.&rdquo; Wanda says. She pulls out a bag with a cloud design on it. I look at her questioningly but pull out the contents of the bag anyways. It&rsquo;s what looks like Pietro&rsquo;s old shirt. My breath hitches at the sight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of Pietro&rsquo;s old shirts. I figured you would like one.&rdquo; Wanda stats. I look at her &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need this. You already gave me one of his blankets.&rdquo; She then smiles at me. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t need it, but I want you to have it; Pietro would want you to have it.&rdquo; I get up and go to hug her and she soon copies. I whisper in her ear &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She whispers back &ldquo;No problem, you deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>We break apart and I look at all the shirts taking in every detail. <i>I am so lucky to have all these amazing people in my life; I love them all so much. </i>I end up looking just at Pietro&rsquo;s old one.</p><p>I snap myself out of my thoughts. &ldquo;Well I should go get changed into actual clothes.&rdquo; I announce to everyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Wear one of the shirts!&rdquo; Peter says excited. &ldquo;I am Groot!&rdquo; Groot agrees. &ldquo;I was planning on it.&rdquo; I respond. Then everyone starts to argue about who&rsquo;s shirt I should put on. I roll my eyes for the hundredth time today and walk to my room to get changed.</p><p>I end up putting on Pietro&rsquo;s old shirt, which is rather tight in the chest area, some old ripped up plain jeans and some sea foam green Converse. I put my hair up into a high ponytail. I don&rsquo;t bother to put on makeup because I am way too lazy to really ever do that; it&rsquo;s just gonna get messed up anyways. I put on a Doctor Who bracelet and a small rose gold bracelet that says 'Stay Strong&rsquo; engraved on it. But finally I put on a silver crown ring on I got from an unknown person on my birthday before the last fight with Ultron.</p><p>I pick up the book I&rsquo;m reading, for the hundredth and tenth time, <b><i>Let It Snow</i></b> by John Green, Lauren Myracle and Maureen Johnson.</p><p>Before I leave me room I say something to 'Pietro&rsquo; or nothingness, still not sure which. &ldquo;Hey, I miss you, a lot. I miss you all the time. Every second. And I want you to know I don&rsquo;t blame you for what happened, I don&rsquo;t think I ever will.&rdquo;</p><p>I walk out of my room and down the hall to the elevator. I get in and go down to the main level so I can leave the tower and go to my favorite place in the world, the book store down the street.</p><p>Before I can reach the door I hear Wanda say telepathically &ldquo;Wait for me. I will be down in one moment.&rdquo; I do as she says and wait by the door for her and, like she said, she is down soon there after.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I go with you to the bookstore?&rdquo; She asks me like I would ever say no to her company. &ldquo;Yeah, of course!&rdquo; I reply without missing a beat. &ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; I ask her and gesture to the door. &ldquo;We shall.&rdquo; She says linking her arm with mine.</p><p>Once we get to the bookstore our paths part. I go and look around at all the books and merchandise for some of the books. I read the back of one which catches my attention. It&rsquo;s called <b><i>To All the Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before </i></b>by Jenny Han. I sit down at a booth they have by a coffee, tea and some pastries bar type thing.</p><p>I order my mint tea and blueberry muffin then hear Wanda&rsquo;s voice in my head. &ldquo;I apparently need to go back to the Tower. I am sorry, I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo; Is all she said before I heard the bell on the door chime signaling someone was entering or exiting.</p><p>I start to read taking a bite of my muffin or a sip of my tea here and there; until I hear Wanda&rsquo;s voice &ldquo;You should come back to the Tower as soon as you can.&rdquo; The bell didn&rsquo;t ring so I know she&rsquo;s not actually here. This mind thing still doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p><p>She said as soon as I can so I get the feeling it&rsquo;s urgent. I run back to the Tower using my speed powers, even though it&rsquo;s just a few minute walk meaning it&rsquo;s probably less then a millisecond run at super speed. I run in the door and use powers to feel where they are. I run to the lab and see everyone standing around a table. &ldquo;What is it? Is everyone okay?!&rdquo; I ask suddenly getting an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and guilt for not being here if something happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Well everyone is okay, even some people we thought weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Bruce says seeming to be very cautious. I feel my eyebrows furrow together in confusion. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I ask felling something bad is about to happen; like how I feel before a fight breaks out.</p><p>Before anyone can answer I feel a slight wind and a hand on my back; no one was behind me. My breathing goes faster. It&rsquo;s one of two things. Either some villain evil guy got in and is gonna kill me or the thing that&rsquo;s okay is Pietro, which seems impossible but weirder things have happened before with this family. I feel a chill run down my spine even thinking about Pietro being alive and breathing again.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello&hellip;&rdquo; I hear something that sounds like Pietro. But that&rsquo;s impossible, even for us. There is no way a dead person can come back to life, absolutely no way.</p><p>My eyes flicker between Bruce and my father at a rapid pace; barely enough time for me to even see them. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Is all I can think to say. <i>Why would they make a thing that sounds like him!? Did they think this would help Me and Wanda!?</i> A million other thoughts race through my mind at a mile a second. They look at me even more confused then they already where.</p><p>Before I can even think about anything else to say a Pietro lookalike is standing in front of me. &ldquo;I have missed you.&rdquo; Is all it says. I look at it not wanting to show any emotion but my nose betrays me by twitching in anger. I don&rsquo;t take my eyes of the presumed robot. &ldquo;How could you!? Did you think this would help me!? 'Yeah lets make a robot of Pietro to help Morgan and Wanda! That&rsquo;s a great idea!&rsquo;&rdquo; I use a dumb sounding voice at the end to imitate them. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; The robot asks looking rather hurt. &ldquo;What did you use to make it have thoughts and emotions? I get how you did it with Vision but how did you do it with this?&rdquo; I ask sounding startling calm even to me. But before they can even think about what I just said I spit out &ldquo;Know what? I don&rsquo;t want to know! I&rsquo;ll be in my room, don&rsquo;t bother me unless it is absolutely necessary.&rdquo; I say then storm out of the room not even bothering to look back even slightly.</p><p>Hot tears sting my eyes and fall down my heated, no doubtably reddened face. I&rsquo;m so angry that I can barely control my own powers. All I can think about is how they could do that. I&rsquo;m Tony&rsquo;s niece who I thought he considered a daughter yet he had the brilliant idea to do this or help do this.</p><p>I get to my room, shut my door with a loud thud and slam my body onto my bed wanting to scream, cry, and punch all at the same time. I wrap myself in the mint blue blanket that Wanda gave me of Pietro&rsquo;s. Between the shirt and the blanket it smells and feels like Pietro is here with me, here living again. I don&rsquo;t bother to hold back anymore; I sob.</p><p>I end up talk to nothingness again hoping that somewhere Pietro can hear, even if it&rsquo;s in a different universe. &ldquo;How much longer do I need to fake being happy? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be whole again. I lost the one person I never knew I needed, how ironic is that. I want you back. I don&rsquo;t want to cry anymore, I don&rsquo;t want to fake happy, I don&rsquo;t want to forget you and I don&rsquo;t want to have to fight to stay okay anymore. I still love everything about you, Pietro. The only thing I don&rsquo;t love about you is the fact you aren&rsquo;t with me. I feel less empty then I was but I don&rsquo;t know why, I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m feeling kinda okay. I mean I&rsquo;m mad and sad but I don&rsquo;t know, what if that was-&rdquo; I cut myself off. &ldquo;No that&rsquo;s insane.&rdquo;</p><p>I hear a knock on my door. I&rsquo;m not okay but I&rsquo;m not showing that to everyone else. It honestly hurts a lot, but I&rsquo;m gonna keep it inside and to myself so it doesn&rsquo;t hurt anyone else.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; I ask. I&rsquo;m not ready to see dad or Bruce.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Steve.&rdquo; Say the voice that belongs to Steve on the other said of the door. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p><p>He opens the door and comes inside. But he doesn&rsquo;t shut the door behind him. I sit up on my bed so he has a place to sit. He does sit, next to me.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t talk for a moment or two. &ldquo;I know this is tough. I kind of went through it with Bucky so I sort of know how your feeling on some level.&rdquo; He takes a deep breath and I assume he&rsquo;s planning out his next words; this makes me have a feeling I&rsquo;m not going to like what he&rsquo;s going to say. &ldquo;I know this is gonna be tough to hear but it&rsquo;s him, and before you get defensive or upset just hear me out. Even if you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s him isn&rsquo;t it worth a shot to see if it is, I mean seriously. We all noticed how upset you got after everything happened that day. Plus if it&rsquo;s him I mean think about how much he&rsquo;s missed out on, he&rsquo;s gonna need a friendly face. I&rsquo;m not gonna say I know for sure it&rsquo;s him but even Wanda thinks it is. So if there is any chance it&rsquo;s him, I suggest you take it. If it&rsquo;s not him and you get even slightly hurt I will owe you so so much and you can completely blame me.&rdquo; He finishes and he seems to wait for my answer.</p><p>It takes me a while to think over everything he said but I do eventually come to a conclusion. I nod seeming to get the message to him that I&rsquo;m going to take the chance that it might be him.</p><p>He gets up and I follow having to focus on what I&rsquo;m doing just to get my legs to move. Steve doesn&rsquo;t even give me a chance to rethink before he takes my shoulder in his hand lightly and directs me to where Pietro is.</p><p>We get to the lab and see the silver haired boy looking down at his hands that are fidgeting on his lap. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen him move in so long. I visited him or his body everyday since the incident. Steve doesn&rsquo;t push or pressure me to go in he seems to be letting me go in when I&rsquo;m ready and I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for that.</p><p>I take a deep breath and open the glass door by the metal bar handle. For once I&rsquo;m grateful that the monitors and other equipment are in the other room. This means it&rsquo;s only Pietro and I in the room since Steve isn&rsquo;t coming in and went the the other room to check medical things with everyone else.</p><p>I stand next to the door rethinking my choice. Before I can escape without him noticing the door shuts making a soft noise that Pietro notices. His head darts up. When he sees me his whole demeanor changes. At first he seems extremely happy to see me, then relieved, then confused and finally sad or maybe guilty.</p><p>&ldquo;May I come over?&rdquo; I ask trying to break the awkward silence. He just nods indicting that I can move towards him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to freak out, I just don&rsquo;t really trust that it&rsquo;s you. I mean you were gone I just don&rsquo;t understand how this could happen.&rdquo; I try to explain feeling guilt starting to drown me.</p><p>&ldquo;You have no reason to be sorry. I am the one who messed up. I am the one who did this.&rdquo; He says. He hasn&rsquo;t stopped moving since I first saw him. I feel tears sting my eyes again, but this time they are from being guilty and I have so much remorse for what I did.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what to say, so I do the only thing I can think to do; I hug him. He doesn&rsquo;t even seem to think. He immediately hugs me back as if we were meant to be like this, which maybe we were.</p><p>We pull back after what seemed like hours. This is the first time I really look at his face. His electric blue eyes are full of energy and light. His face is still pale but now it&rsquo;s just pale it&rsquo;s not dead person, no blood flow pale. His lips have color they are slightly pink and purple but they aren&rsquo;t just pale and lifeless. This is when I finally realize that what I was being told was and is true.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo; I all I can say over the shock. </p><p>He then reply&rsquo;s with: </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see that coming?&rdquo;</p>",
