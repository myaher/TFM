Me? Why me?&rdquo;, Dan shot back</p><p>&ldquo;Well you brought up the idea in playing it&rdquo;, Phil explained</p><p>&ldquo;And you accepted it!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil sighed, giggling after cause the way his breath left his mouth amused him somehow, &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll start&rdquo;</p><p>Phil put his right hand on Dan&rsquo;s left thigh and got more up to Dan&rsquo;s crotch, waiting until Dan would react but he didn&rsquo;t and then it was Dan&rsquo;s turn so Phil put his hand by his side</p><p>Dan did the same as Phil and he didn&rsquo;t chicken out, neither of the men chickened out so Dan decided to kick it up a notch</p><p>When it was Dan&rsquo;s turn he scooted closer to Phil and leaned his head forward slowly to kiss Phil and waiting for him to chicken out</p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s lips were touching Phil&rsquo;s and yet he still didn&rsquo;t chicken out, so Dan forced his tongue inside Phil&rsquo;s mouth and the only thing Dan got was a kiss back and a fight for dominance</p><p>He lost but he still liked it, no he didn&rsquo;t like it, he loved it</p><p>Phil pushed Dan so his back was on the floor and got Dan&rsquo;s waist between his knees and placed his butt on Dan&rsquo;s crotch making Dan moan into the kiss</p><p>Dan started to grind on Phil, making both men horny </p><p>Eventually, both men pulled away from the kiss, but not too far from each other, &ldquo;Phil..&rdquo;, Dan gasped, asking silently for something that both of them wanted</p><p>Phil nodded and unzipped both of their jeans, &ldquo;Lube?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan hummed as Phil got up and got the lube that was inside his nightstand drawer, they&rsquo;re drunken minds didn&rsquo;t even think of having sex on his bed so that Phil didn&rsquo;t have to walk to the bedroom and back</p><p>When Phil arrived back, Dan was already stripped naked and waiting impatiently for his mate to arrive, is Phil still his mate or is he something more now?</p><p>Phil stripped naked as soon as he saw Dan and stumbled by every step he took but he was too into the moment to care or laugh about it </p><p>Phil sat in the same position before he went for the lube, putting the lube beside him, Phil kissed Dan again but this one was more of a clash and teeth touching, it wasn&rsquo;t good to look at but Dan and Phil liked it non the less </p><p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo;, Phil asked after they broke the kiss to breathe</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? It&rsquo;s more if you are ready&rdquo;, Dan said </p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m getting inside of you so I&rsquo;m supposed to ask, Dan&rdquo;, Phil shot back and took the lupe</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna be bottom, Phil!&rdquo;, Dan slurred and pushed Phil off of him</p><p>&ldquo;Ye and me neither&rdquo;, Phil stood up and crossed his arms, looking straight into Dan&rsquo;s eyes</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, I&rsquo;m too horny for this shit, just let me be top!&rdquo;, Dan looked anywhere else but Phil, not wanting to look at him at the moment</p><p>&ldquo;And disobey what the phandom truly wants? No, Dan&rdquo;, Phil said softly, putting the lube on the coffee table beside his two unfinished beer cans</p><p>&ldquo;There are people in the phandom that wants me to be top, too, y'know&rdquo;, Dan muttered and looked back at Phil who was chuckling, &ldquo;Oi! What&rsquo;s so funny?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;, Phil shook his head and offered Dan his hand to help him stand up, &ldquo;Just come, M'tired&rdquo;</p><p>Dan hummed and took Phil&rsquo;s hand who -rather strongly- helped him up which made him fall into Phil&rsquo;s arms, making both of them laugh</p><p>They decided to sleep in Phil&rsquo;s bedroom for the night and very clumsily, they made it to his room and fell straight on the bed </p><p>They were too tired to but the duvet over their still naked body and just cuddled, Phil was the first to fall asleep followed soon after by Dan</p><p>They were both too drunk to take care of their hardened cocks</p><p>*</p><p>The next morning, Dan was the first to wake up, and boy was he startled when he saw he was in Phil&rsquo;s bedroom, on his bed, tangled all up on him and most of all; he was naked</p><p>So Dan did the most logical way he knew, panicked, fake slept and desperately hoped that Phil wasn\u2019t doing the same thing</p><p>Sure Dan could just walk slowly to his own room and go to sleep there, but the comfort of Phil&rsquo;s hands hugging him and the rise and fall of his chest was to die for</p><p>Half an hour had passed and Dan could finally feel a movement from Phil and a yawn escaping his lips so Dan pretended to wake up too at that moment and stretched his sleepiness away </p><p>&ldquo;G'morning&rdquo;, Phil muttered before he took notice how the situation was</p><p>When Phil noticed, he wasn&rsquo;t surprised and just simply said, &ldquo;Did you cheat?&rdquo;, earning a smack on the face with a pillow by Dan</p><p>Lets just say, after that they&rsquo;ve been closer than ever.</p>",
