Kirishima had changed, now sporting black shorts and a tee shirt with \u2018Red Riot\u2019 emblazoned across the front.</p><p>\u201cWhere can we watch?\u201d Izuku pulled a clean shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a TV backstage.\u201d Kirishima nodded to the area behind the locker room. Izuku had seen it briefly on his way in; there were boxes upon boxes of sound equipment and gear. Between the women and men\u2019s locker rooms was a small sitting room with a mini-fridge, tables, and chairs. The TV was hooked directly to the cameras at ringside.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You don\u2019t want to miss the start.\u201d Kirishima prodded him.</p><p>Izuku closed his locker and followed Kirishima. A few others were already tuned in. Kaminari and Sero sat with their eyes glued to the TV. Todoroki stood in the corner, gnawing on a protein bar. He still looked disinterested in anything and everything.</p><p>Izuku took the chair next to Sero. He hadn\u2019t had the chance to meet Momo &ndash; Creati, as the fans called her &ndash; while he was backstage, but he recognized her the instant she appeared on the TV. Her long black ponytail had been her signature look since she debuted. She already stood in the ring, holding her championship belt for everyone to see.</p><p>\u201cDoes Uraraka have a chance?\u201d Kaminari whispered to Sero, who took a long sip from a water bottle before answering.</p><p>\u201cMomo\u2019s one of the smartest wrestlers to ever exist,\u201d Sero said, \u201cand Uraraka\u2019s still green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only been wrestling for a year,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cShe\u2019s talented, but her ring-sense needs work. Kinda like you.\u201d He nudged Izuku in the side.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Izuku agreed. He knew he had a lot to learn. But if Uraraka could make it to the championship match in less than a year, then so could he, right?</p><p>The camera panned to Uraraka. Brown tape circled her wrists. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a striking specialist. Trained with a martial art Olympian for a few years. The tape helps to protect her fingers and wrist.\u201d Kirishima answered.</p><p>The bell dinged and the entire room fell silent.</p><p>Momo circled Uraraka, gauging her strength. Uraraka raised her fists. For a moment, nothing happened.</p><p>Uraraka lunged. Momo caught her around the waist and lifted Uraraka over her shoulder. Momo threw her weight back, tossing Uraraka across the ring like a ragdoll. She landed hard on her back.</p><p>Momo wasted no time. She launched her body weight onto Uraraka\u2019s stomach. Uraraka flinched, but before she could roll away, Momo pinned her shoulders against the mat.</p><p>One count.</p><p>Uraraka twisted but couldn\u2019t free herself from Momo\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Two counts.</p><p>Uraraka kicked out, breaking the hold. She struck Momo\u2019s back and sent her sprawling. Uraraka rolled to her feet, braced herself against the ropes, and lashed out. Momo took three kick to the rib cage before she crawled out of Uraraka\u2019s range.</p><p>Maybe Uraraka had a better chance than the others gave her credit for.</p><p>Momo grabbed the ropes, hauling herself to her feet, one hand holding her battered ribs. Uraraka charged. As they collided, Momo latched onto her feet and shoved Uraraka over the top rope. Uraraka flew outside the ring, landing with a smack that echoed loud and clear on the concrete.</p><p>Everyone cringed. Kirishima let out a low whistle in sympathy. Even Todoroki blinked (Izuku chose to believe that was a form of emotion).</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gotta hurt.\u201d Present Mic\u2019s voice echoed over the loudspeakers.</p><p>\u201cSmart move on Creati\u2019s part, using Uravity\u2019s momentum against her. There was no stopping that.\u201d Aizawa, the far less enthusiastic announcer, commented.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s Creati planning now &ndash;\u201d Present Mic stopped mid-sentence as Momo positioned herself in a corner of the ring, hands on the top rope. \u201cShe can\u2019t possibly be thinking of flying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to the top rope.\u201d Aizawa finished.</p><p>Momo stood on the top turnbuckle, knees bent. Uraraka lay face down on the floor, struggling to collect her breath. Momo launched herself off the top rope.</p><p>Her body slammed into Uraraka\u2019s, snapping her to the ground. Izuku was surprised it didn\u2019t break Uraraka in half.</p><p>Momo rolled off of her, clutching her ribs.</p><p>\u201cIt was a great move, but all eliminations have to occur inside the ring,\u201d Mic said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if either woman can get up before they\u2019re counted out!\u201d</p><p>Uraraka struggled to her feet, clutching the back of her neck. The tape on her left hand was unraveling, but she couldn\u2019t stop to fix it. Breathing hard, Uraraka grabbed Momo by the shoulder and drove her, injured ribs first, into the barricade. Momo crumpled to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThat might be it!\u201d Mic shouted. \u201cMomo isn\u2019t moving!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUravity still has to get her back in the ring for it to count,\u201d Aizawa said.</p><p>Uraraka wrapped Momo\u2019s ponytail around her hand, hooked her other hand around Momo\u2019s leg, and tossed her under the ropes. Momo\u2019s eyes were open, but she made no effort to move.</p><p>Uraraka dove in after her. Izuku felt a ray of hope explode in his chest. He couldn&rsquo;t put words to why he wanted Uraraka to win so badly, but he did. This was her chance. The champ was down. If she could pin Momo here &ndash;</p><p>Uraraka lifted Momo\u2019s legs.</p><p>Before the referee even started the count, Momo exploded into action, flipping Uraraka around and wrapping her arm around Uraraka\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cShe locked in a choke hold!\u201d Kaminari almost jumped out of his seat.</p><p>\u201cBut she was barely able to move. How &ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was faking,\u201d Todoroki said, interrupting Izuku in a monotone voice that froze his blood. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to anyone who\u2019s wrestled for a while. Momo faked it because she knew Uraraka would take the bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Uraraka going to tap?\u201d Sero asked, eyes locked onto the screen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gotta tap,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cMomo\u2019s got her locked in. There\u2019s no way she can fight her way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the middle of the ring, too,\u201d Sero said. \u201cShe can\u2019t get to the ropes to force a break.\u201d</p><p>Uraraka struggled, wiggling and slapping the air, but Momo kept the pressure on, twisting her neck slightly. The more Uraraka struggled, the more out of breath she got.</p><p>She coughed weakly.</p><p>\u201cShe has to tap.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s mouth hung open. \u201cShe\u2019ll pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Momo\u2019s win either way.\u201d Kaminari agreed. \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d</p><p>Uraraka tried to crawl to her knees, but Momo pushed her back down. Izuku held his breath. Uraraka stretched out her arm, reaching for the ropes, but they were still another arm\u2019s length away.</p><p>Her head dropped and she went limp.</p><!-- more --><p>The bell dinged and the refs pushed Momo away. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, your winner, retaining her championship title, Creati!\u201d</p><p>Uraraka stirred, sucking in a deep breath of air. She sat up, tears already in her eyes. She didn\u2019t even bother to raise Momo\u2019s hand. She pushed herself out of the ring and walked sullenly back down the ramp. A few fans tried to cheer her up as she passed, offering high-fives and cheers, but she didn\u2019t lift her head to see them.</p><p>\u201cTalk about bad sportsmanship.\u201d Mic huffed.</p><p>\u201cWe all know how much this match meant to Uravity,\u201d Aizawa said. For once, there was a hint of sympathy in his voice. \u201cI think she\u2019s upset at herself more than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Momo\u2019s fault she\u2019s the better wrestler! You still gotta pay respect where respect is due.\u201d Mic argued. \u201cUravity\u2019s asking for a feud, and there\u2019s no way she can handle Momo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say it out loud. I think tonight proved that just fine.\u201d Aizawa chided.</p><p>Before Izuku could hear Mic\u2019s response, the door to the lounge swang open. Uraraka walked through, realizing too late that it was occupied.</p><p>\u201cOchako &ndash;\u201d Kirishima started.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she warned. She bit her lip, head dropping to the floor. Her hands dug into her hips. She shook her head, then turned and fled back the way she\u2019d come.</p><p>Izuku stood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go after her,\u201d Kirishima said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kirishima turned around to face Izuku. \u201cFor one, she\u2019s going into the women\u2019s locker room. Second, medical staff needs to check her after that knockout. And third, she needs time to process what just happened.\u201d</p><p>Izuku settled back into his chair. \u201cI want to make sure she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can. In a few minutes. And when, you know, she\u2019s not in the locker room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Once, this novice tried to get in there and Mina suplexed him through a mirror.\u201d Kaminari added.</p><p>\u201cHe was injured so badly he couldn\u2019t make his debut as \u2018grape rush,\u2019\u201d Sero added. \u201cIt was unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki deadpanned. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Izuku wasn\u2019t quite sure how to respond to that. Luckily for him, he didn\u2019t have to. On TV, another wrestler jumped the barricade and grabbed a mic.</p><p>Bakugou stood in the spotlight, the championship belt over his shoulder, reflecting dazzling rainbows through the crowd. \u201cAlright, alright, settle down.\u201d He shouted to be heard over the crowd. \u201cCreati had her moment. Really, good for her. But can we turn our attention back to what really matters now?\u201d</p><p>A few people tried to boo him, but they were drowned out as he continued. \u201cNow, people have this notion about being a pro wrestler; if you\u2019re a legacy or if you have the blessing of a champ, you\u2019ll somehow become the greatest of all time. And I, for one, have a problem with that. Because unlike some people here, I earned my spot on this roster without anyone\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>More boos rose from the crowd. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Kaminari asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s talking about someone.\u201d Kirishima made a pointed gesture behind them, where Todoroki still showed no interest in the TV.</p><p>\u201cAnd unlike other people, I want to prove to everyone here that I\u2019m the best, no matter what the legendary champions say.\u201d Bakugou ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cSo, this is my declaration of war. Todoroki Shouto and Midoriya Izuku; I\u2019m taking you two on in a tag team match. The two of you against Red Riot and I. We\u2019ll prove that wrestling has a new champ in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will?\u201d Kirishima almost fell out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know he was doing this?\u201d Sero asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t just challenge people like that, can he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the champion. He can do whatever he wants &ndash;\u201d</p><p>Before Izuku could process what it meant, a second shadowy figure emerged from backstage. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot of talk for someone who\u2019s only held that belt for a week.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki appeared on screen. He was as monotone as ever. \u201cUnlike you,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t care what my father thinks of me or anyone else. If you genuinely believe I\u2019ve had opportunities handed to me because of my lineage, then you\u2019re crazier than I thought. Does this look like an opportunity to you?\u201d He pointed to the jagged scar across his eye.</p><p>\u201cI never had my dad\u2019s blessing to enter this arena. I made it here on my own will, same as you. But unlike you, I\u2019m not a jealous, ego-maniac who needs validation every step of the way. So I accept your challenge. And I\u2019ll prove to you that my parents mean nothing.\u201d</p><p>Izuku and Kirishima exchanged a look. \u201cI, uh\u2026 guess I\u2019ll see you next week.\u201d Kirishima finally said.</p><p>****</p><p>He couldn\u2019t return to the locker room out of fear that Bakugou would be waiting. Or, somehow even worse, Todoroki. At least Izuku had run into Bakugou before. Todoroki was a complete unknown. How could he team up with someone who wouldn\u2019t even talk to him?</p><p>Instead of the locker room, Izuku walked deeper backstage. Maybe he could find a place to clear his mind among the crates and boxes.</p><p>He ducked around a stack of merchandise and sank to the floor. \u201cYou come here to clear your head too?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. Uraraka sat against the wall. Her eyes were dry, but her cheeks were still red and puffy. \u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Bakugou\u2019s thinking, calling you out like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make a name for himself, I suppose.\u201d Izuku sighed. \u201cWe all are.\u201d</p><p>Uraraka leaned back, rubbing the red mark around her neck. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Izuku said suddenly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tap out?\u201d</p><p>She laughed drily. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give up. I knew I couldn\u2019t win, but I didn\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have gotten seriously hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cLook, the championship, it\u2019s more than a title to me. I didn\u2019t come from a wealthy family. They struggle to get by. I send them almost half of my paycheck every fight to keep them afloat. If I was champion, I\u2019d get more money, more opportunities. Maybe they\u2019d finally start making merch for me. Then&hellip;then maybe I could invest, and then my parents wouldn\u2019t have to rely on me. I just need one push, and then I can help them out for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault. Can\u2019t blame Momo for wanting to keep the title. Sometimes you just get the short end of the stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>Uraraka pushed herself to her feet. \u201cI should probably go see how Momo\u2019s ribs are. Good luck next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I need it?\u201d</p><p>The half-smile, almost pitying, said it all.</p><p>****</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s theme song are we using?\u201d Izuku asked. No response. Todoroki stared straight ahead, unwavering.</p><p>\u201cWho should we have start out in the ring?\u201d Izuku tried again. Still, nothing.</p><p>One last time, he tried to ask, \u201cDo you want to go after Kirishima or Bakugou?\u201d</p><p>The speakers jumped to life. \u201cShowtime,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>Their entrance was hardly smooth. They tripped over each other, unsure of who was going which way, how fast to walk, or where the other was going. Izuku ended up trailing Todoroki like a sad puppy. He didn\u2019t know the theme song well and ended up offbeat.</p><p>Todoroki jumped onto the apron, remaining outside the ring. He waved his hand to Izuku, as if to say, get in.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the most&hellip;oddball tag team match I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Mic announced. \u201cThe rules are simple. Each team has two people, but only one member per team can be in the ring at a time. If your partner gets too beaten down to continue, they must tag you in before you can enter. The team member not currently in the ring must stay beside the designated corner. No interfering! The match ends when a legal participant is pinned or subdued. Only one member of the team has to be taken down &ndash; not both. As a reminder for everyone in the audience, even though tonight\u2019s match features the champion, the title is not up for grabs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither outcome, Ground Zero will keep his title,\u201d Aizawa said dully. \u201cHe has nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to lose but his pride!\u201d Mic corrected. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who threw down this challenge. He better see it through!\u201d</p><p>Izuku glanced across the ring. Kirishima already stood inside. Strange. If Bakugou was the one with something to prove, why didn\u2019t he start?</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t have time to dwell on it. The bell rang. Izuku forced himself not to jump into action; last time it didn\u2019t work out too well. Kirishima caught his eye and smiled as if he knew exactly what Izuku was thinking. \u201cCome on!\u201d Kirishima yelled. \u201cCome at me!\u201d</p><p>Before Izuku had a chance, Bakugou reached over the ropes and slapped Kirishima\u2019s shoulder. Kirishima\u2019s smile faltered.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re just going to mess with him, then I\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d Bakugou said, stepping into the ring.</p><p>\u201cGround Zero just tapped himself in!\u201d Mic said. \u201cSurprising, but technically not illegal!\u201d</p><p>Izuku\u2019s heart crawled into his chest. He\u2019d fought Kirishima before, but for the most part, Bakugou was a massive unknown to him. What moves did he like? What was his style? Was he analytical? Fast? Did he grapple, or strike?</p><p>Izuku didn\u2019t know any of that. All he knew was Bakugou was good enough to be the champion.</p><p>He needed more information.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wouldn\u2019t get it. Bakugou charged, locking Izuku up and shoving him into the corner. The turnbuckles pounded into his back. His neck snapped back, catching his head across the ropes.</p><p>Bakugou braced himself on the ropes, then delivered a powerful kick right into Izuku\u2019s stomach. Izuku lurched forward, folding in to protect himself. Another kick drove his shoulder into the turnbuckle. Bakugou took a running start and shoved his foot against Izuku\u2019s neck, pinning him in a choke against the ropes.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d the ref started to count. Bakugou could only hold Izuku there for a few seconds, or he would be disqualified. \u201cFour. Three. Two.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou released him. Izuku collapsed to the ground, coughing. Was this how Uraraka felt last week?</p><p>Before he could regroup his thoughts, Bakugou climbed to the top rope. In the back of his mind, Izuku knew he should move, but he couldn&rsquo;t find the strength to get out of the way. Bakugou jumped, landing with an elbow to Izuku\u2019s torso.</p><p>Bakugou pinned him against the mat, but Izuku kicked out. Bakugou rolled away, pushing his hair back, jaw clenched in frustration. He kicked Izuku in the back, turning him over. He stared at the ceiling. The lights really were blinding at this angle. He could hardly see Bakugou scale to the second rope and jump again.</p><p>On instinct, Izuku raised his knees.</p><p>Bakugou fell across Izuku\u2019s shins, reversing the attack. Bakugou struggled to sit up, clutching his side. Now was his chance. Izuku kicked Bakugou\u2019s shoulder, forcing him down. Izuku lifted his legs, pinning Bakugou underneath him.</p><p>\u201cOne! Two!\u201d Bakugou rolled out. Dammit. He still wasn\u2019t weak enough.</p><p>Before he could plot his next move, Bakugou whirled around, catching Izuku across the face with his elbow. Izuku collapsed, the world spinning.</p><p>\u201cIzuku needs to make a tag,\u201d Mic said.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s halfway across the ring,\u201d Aizawa said.</p><p>Izuku glanced up. Todoroki watched, still not fully engaged. His hand was free, ready to tag in if Izuku could make it to him, but Todoroki made no effort to cheer him on. Maybe what Bakugou said about his dad hit too close to home.</p><p>Todoroki looked like he\u2019d rather be anywhere but there.</p><p>Fine. If he didn\u2019t want in, then Izuku would figure it out himself. Bakugou rolled to the corner and tapped Kirishima\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGround Zero is out, Red Riot is legal!\u201d</p><p>Kirishima wasted no time. He swooped in, yanked Izuku to his feet and pulled him firefighter style over his shoulders. Izuku had no way to counter as Kirishima threw Izuku to the mat and crushed him. Kirishima turned Izuku onto his side and grabbed him by the arm and leg. He launched Izuku like a frisbee, throwing him across the ring.</p><p>Izuku\u2019s face slammed into the mat.</p><p>Everything hurt. He wasn\u2019t sure he could tell up from down or right from left. He could just barely make out Todoroki\u2019s expression. He wasn\u2019t too far away. But Todoroki still didn\u2019t look ready to tag in.</p><p>Izuku propped himself on his elbows. \u201cYou aren\u2019t just a legacy! You\u2019re your own person too!\u201d He shouted.</p><p>He had no way of knowing how he knew it. He just did. This was about Todoroki\u2019s father, somehow.</p><p>He must have hit a nerve, because Todoroki suddenly surged forward, holding out his hand, stretching as far as he could. Izuku tapped him in and rolled to the outside of the ring, finally able to catch his breath.</p><p>Izuku glanced up in time to see Todoroki sprint across the ring, clotheslining Kirishima. He fell hard to the mat, and before he could even get up, Todoroki slammed one foot between his shoulder blades, holding him down. He grabbed Kirishima\u2019s arm and lifted it up, twisting his elbow violently outward.</p><p>Kirishima tapped in submission almost immediately.</p><p>Present Mic fought to be heard over the ending bell. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us saw that coming! Man, I\u2019ve never seen him look that passionate about a match before!\u201d</p><p>The ref raised both Izuku and Todoroki\u2019s hands in the air. Kirishima and Bakugou retreated backstage, Kirishima holding his shoulder. Izuku hoped it wasn\u2019t dislocated.</p><p>Before Izuku could head back into the locker room, someone ducked beneath the ropes, microphone in hand. Not someone, exactly. He was small&hellip;almost&hellip;a rat?</p><p>\u201cIzuku Midoriya. We\u2019ve met,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Nedzu, the general manager here at the WWE. You\u2018ve impressed me tonight, so to celebrate your win, I\u2019m offering you a match you won\u2019t forget. You\u2019ll face a crowd favorite, Kaminari Denki &ndash; Charge Bolt! Extreme rules. Anything goes. Next week. Be there, or be caught unaware. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d</p>",

Kirishima had changed, now sporting black shorts and a tee shirt with &lsquo;Red Riot&rsquo; emblazoned across the front.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where can we watch?&rdquo; Izuku pulled a clean shirt over his head.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a TV backstage.&rdquo; Kirishima nodded to the area behind the locker room. Izuku had seen it briefly on his way in; there were boxes upon boxes of sound equipment and gear. Between the women and men&rsquo;s locker rooms was a small sitting room with a mini-fridge, tables, and chairs. The TV was hooked directly to the cameras at ringside.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come on. You don&rsquo;t want to miss the start.&rdquo; Kirishima prodded him.</p>\n<p>Izuku closed his locker and followed Kirishima. A few others were already tuned in. Kaminari and Sero sat with their eyes glued to the TV. Todoroki stood in the corner, gnawing on a protein bar. He still looked disinterested in anything and everything.</p>\n<p>Izuku took the chair next to Sero. He hadn&rsquo;t had the chance to meet Momo &ndash; Creati, as the fans called her &ndash; while he was backstage, but he recognized her the instant she appeared on the TV. Her long black ponytail had been her signature look since she debuted. She already stood in the ring, holding her championship belt for everyone to see.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Does Uraraka have a chance?&rdquo; Kaminari whispered to Sero, who took a long sip from a water bottle before answering.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Momo&rsquo;s one of the smartest wrestlers to ever exist,&rdquo; Sero said, &ldquo;and Uraraka&rsquo;s still green.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only been wrestling for a year,&rdquo; Kirishima said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s talented, but her ring-sense needs work. Kinda like you.&rdquo; He nudged Izuku in the side.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Izuku agreed. He knew he had a lot to learn. But if Uraraka could make it to the championship match in less than a year, then so could he, right?</p>\n<p>The camera panned to Uraraka. Brown tape circled her wrists. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a striking specialist. Trained with a martial art Olympian for a few years. The tape helps to protect her fingers and wrist.&rdquo; Kirishima answered.</p>\n<p>The bell dinged and the entire room fell silent.</p>\n<p>Momo circled Uraraka, gauging her strength. Uraraka raised her fists. For a moment, nothing happened.</p>\n<p>Uraraka lunged. Momo caught her around the waist and lifted Uraraka over her shoulder. Momo threw her weight back, tossing Uraraka across the ring like a ragdoll. She landed hard on her back.</p>\n<p>Momo wasted no time. She launched her body weight onto Uraraka&rsquo;s stomach. Uraraka flinched, but before she could roll away, Momo pinned her shoulders against the mat.</p>\n<p>One count.</p>\n<p>Uraraka twisted but couldn&rsquo;t free herself from Momo&rsquo;s grasp.</p>\n<p>Two counts.</p>\n<p>Uraraka kicked out, breaking the hold. She struck Momo&rsquo;s back and sent her sprawling. Uraraka rolled to her feet, braced herself against the ropes, and lashed out. Momo took three kick to the rib cage before she crawled out of Uraraka&rsquo;s range.</p>\n<p>Maybe Uraraka had a better chance than the others gave her credit for.</p>\n<p>Momo grabbed the ropes, hauling herself to her feet, one hand holding her battered ribs. Uraraka charged. As they collided, Momo latched onto her feet and shoved Uraraka over the top rope. Uraraka flew outside the ring, landing with a smack that echoed loud and clear on the concrete.</p>\n<p>Everyone cringed. Kirishima let out a low whistle in sympathy. Even Todoroki blinked (Izuku chose to believe that was a form of emotion).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s gotta hurt.&rdquo; Present Mic&rsquo;s voice echoed over the loudspeakers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Smart move on Creati&rsquo;s part, using Uravity&rsquo;s momentum against her. There was no stopping that.&rdquo; Aizawa, the far less enthusiastic announcer, commented.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s Creati planning now &ndash;&rdquo; Present Mic stopped mid-sentence as Momo positioned herself in a corner of the ring, hands on the top rope. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t possibly be thinking of flying!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to the top rope.&rdquo; Aizawa finished.</p>\n<p>Momo stood on the top turnbuckle, knees bent. Uraraka lay face down on the floor, struggling to collect her breath. Momo launched herself off the top rope.</p>\n<p>Her body slammed into Uraraka&rsquo;s, snapping her to the ground. Izuku was surprised it didn&rsquo;t break Uraraka in half.</p>\n<p>Momo rolled off of her, clutching her ribs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a great move, but all eliminations have to occur inside the ring,&rdquo; Mic said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if either woman can get up before they&rsquo;re counted out!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Uraraka struggled to her feet, clutching the back of her neck. The tape on her left hand was unraveling, but she couldn&rsquo;t stop to fix it. Breathing hard, Uraraka grabbed Momo by the shoulder and drove her, injured ribs first, into the barricade. Momo crumpled to the floor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That might be it!&rdquo; Mic shouted. &ldquo;Momo isn&rsquo;t moving!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uravity still has to get her back in the ring for it to count,&rdquo; Aizawa said.</p>\n<p>Uraraka wrapped Momo&rsquo;s ponytail around her hand, hooked her other hand around Momo&rsquo;s leg, and tossed her under the ropes. Momo&rsquo;s eyes were open, but she made no effort to move.</p>\n<p>Uraraka dove in after her. Izuku felt a ray of hope explode in his chest. He couldn&rsquo;t put words to why he wanted Uraraka to win so badly, but he did. This was her chance. The champ was down. If she could pin Momo here &ndash;</p>\n<p>Uraraka lifted Momo&rsquo;s legs.</p>\n<p>Before the referee even started the count, Momo exploded into action, flipping Uraraka around and wrapping her arm around Uraraka&rsquo;s throat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She locked in a choke hold!&rdquo; Kaminari almost jumped out of his seat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But she was barely able to move. How &ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She was faking,&rdquo; Todoroki said, interrupting Izuku in a monotone voice that froze his blood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious to anyone who&rsquo;s wrestled for a while. Momo faked it because she knew Uraraka would take the bait.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is Uraraka going to tap?&rdquo; Sero asked, eyes locked onto the screen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gotta tap,&rdquo; Kirishima said. &ldquo;Momo&rsquo;s got her locked in. There&rsquo;s no way she can fight her way out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the middle of the ring, too,&rdquo; Sero said. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t get to the ropes to force a break.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Uraraka struggled, wiggling and slapping the air, but Momo kept the pressure on, twisting her neck slightly. The more Uraraka struggled, the more out of breath she got.</p>\n<p>She coughed weakly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She has to tap.&rdquo; Kirishima&rsquo;s mouth hung open. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll pass out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Momo&rsquo;s win either way.&rdquo; Kaminari agreed. &ldquo;What is she doing?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Uraraka tried to crawl to her knees, but Momo pushed her back down. Izuku held his breath. Uraraka stretched out her arm, reaching for the ropes, but they were still another arm&rsquo;s length away.</p>\n<p>Her head dropped and she went limp.</p>\n",

She sat up, tears already in her eyes. She didn\u2019t even bother to raise Momo\u2019s hand. She pushed herself out of the ring and walked sullenly back down the ramp. A few fans tried to cheer her up as she passed, offering high-fives and cheers, but she didn\u2019t lift her head to see them.</p><p>\u201cTalk about bad sportsmanship.\u201d Mic huffed.</p><p>\u201cWe all know how much this match meant to Uravity,\u201d Aizawa said. For once, there was a hint of sympathy in his voice. \u201cI think she\u2019s upset at herself more than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Momo\u2019s fault she\u2019s the better wrestler! You still gotta pay respect where respect is due.\u201d Mic argued. \u201cUravity\u2019s asking for a feud, and there\u2019s no way she can handle Momo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say it out loud. I think tonight proved that just fine.\u201d Aizawa chided.</p><p>Before Izuku could hear Mic\u2019s response, the door to the lounge swang open. Uraraka walked through, realizing too late that it was occupied.</p><p>\u201cOchako \u2013\u201d Kirishima started.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she warned. She bit her lip, head dropping to the floor. Her hands dug into her hips. She shook her head, then turned and fled back the way she\u2019d come.</p><p>Izuku stood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go after her,\u201d Kirishima said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kirishima turned around to face Izuku. \u201cFor one, she\u2019s going into the women\u2019s locker room. Second, medical staff needs to check her after that knockout. And third, she needs time to process what just happened.\u201d</p><p>Izuku settled back into his chair. \u201cI want to make sure she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can. In a few minutes. And when, you know, she\u2019s not in the locker room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Once, this novice tried to get in there and Mina suplexed him through a mirror.\u201d Kaminari added.</p><p>\u201cHe was injured so badly he couldn\u2019t make his debut as \u2018grape rush,\u2019\u201d Sero added. \u201cIt was unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki deadpanned. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Izuku wasn\u2019t quite sure how to respond to that. Luckily for him, he didn\u2019t have to. On TV, another wrestler jumped the barricade and grabbed a mic.</p><p>Bakugou stood in the spotlight, the championship belt over his shoulder, reflecting dazzling rainbows through the crowd. \u201cAlright, alright, settle down.\u201d He shouted to be heard over the crowd. \u201cCreati had her moment. Really, good for her. But can we turn our attention back to what really matters now?\u201d</p><p>A few people tried to boo him, but they were drowned out as he continued. \u201cNow, people have this notion about being a pro wrestler; if you\u2019re a legacy or if you have the blessing of a champ, you\u2019ll somehow become the greatest of all time. And I, for one, have a problem with that. Because unlike some people here, I earned my spot on this roster without anyone\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>More boos rose from the crowd. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Kaminari asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s talking about someone.\u201d Kirishima made a pointed gesture behind them, where Todoroki still showed no interest in the TV.</p><p>\u201cAnd unlike other people, I want to prove to everyone here that I\u2019m the best, no matter what the legendary champions say.\u201d Bakugou ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cSo, this is my declaration of war. Todoroki Shouto and Midoriya Izuku; I\u2019m taking you two on in a tag team match. The two of you against Red Riot and I. We\u2019ll prove that wrestling has a new champ in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will?\u201d Kirishima almost fell out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know he was doing this?\u201d Sero asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t just challenge people like that, can he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the champion. He can do whatever he wants \u2013\u201d</p><p>Before Izuku could process what it meant, a second shadowy figure emerged from backstage. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot of talk for someone who\u2019s only held that belt for a week.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki appeared on screen. He was as monotone as ever. \u201cUnlike you,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t care what my father thinks of me or anyone else. If you genuinely believe I\u2019ve had opportunities handed to me because of my lineage, then you\u2019re crazier than I thought. Does this look like an opportunity to you?\u201d He pointed to the jagged scar across his eye.</p><p>\u201cI never had my dad\u2019s blessing to enter this arena. I made it here on my own will, same as you. But unlike you, I\u2019m not a jealous, ego-maniac who needs validation every step of the way. So I accept your challenge. And I\u2019ll prove to you that my parents mean nothing.\u201d</p><p>Izuku and Kirishima exchanged a look. \u201cI, uh\u2026 guess I\u2019ll see you next week.\u201d Kirishima finally said.</p><p>****</p><p>He couldn\u2019t return to the locker room out of fear that Bakugou would be waiting. Or, somehow even worse, Todoroki. At least Izuku had run into Bakugou before. Todoroki was a complete unknown. How could he team up with someone who wouldn\u2019t even talk to him?</p><p>Instead of the locker room, Izuku walked deeper backstage. Maybe he could find a place to clear his mind among the crates and boxes.</p><p>He ducked around a stack of merchandise and sank to the floor. \u201cYou come here to clear your head too?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. Uraraka sat against the wall. Her eyes were dry, but her cheeks were still red and puffy. \u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Bakugou\u2019s thinking, calling you out like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make a name for himself, I suppose.\u201d Izuku sighed. \u201cWe all are.\u201d</p><p>Uraraka leaned back, rubbing the red mark around her neck. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Izuku said suddenly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tap out?\u201d</p><p>She laughed drily. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give up. I knew I couldn\u2019t win, but I didn\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have gotten seriously hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cLook, the championship, it\u2019s more than a title to me. I didn\u2019t come from a wealthy family. They struggle to get by. I send them almost half of my paycheck every fight to keep them afloat. If I was champion, I\u2019d get more money, more opportunities. Maybe they\u2019d finally start making merch for me. Then\u2026then maybe I could invest, and then my parents wouldn\u2019t have to rely on me. I just need one push, and then I can help them out for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault. Can\u2019t blame Momo for wanting to keep the title. Sometimes you just get the short end of the stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>Uraraka pushed herself to her feet. \u201cI should probably go see how Momo\u2019s ribs are. Good luck next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I need it?\u201d</p><p>The half-smile, almost pitying, said it all.</p><p>****</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s theme song are we using?\u201d Izuku asked. No response. Todoroki stared straight ahead, unwavering.</p><p>\u201cWho should we have start out in the ring?\u201d Izuku tried again. Still, nothing.</p><p>One last time, he tried to ask, \u201cDo you want to go after Kirishima or Bakugou?\u201d</p><p>The speakers jumped to life. \u201cShowtime,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>Their entrance was hardly smooth. They tripped over each other, unsure of who was going which way, how fast to walk, or where the other was going. Izuku ended up trailing Todoroki like a sad puppy. He didn\u2019t know the theme song well and ended up offbeat.</p><p>Todoroki jumped onto the apron, remaining outside the ring. He waved his hand to Izuku, as if to say, get in.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the most\u2026oddball tag team match I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Mic announced. \u201cThe rules are simple. Each team has two people, but only one member per team can be in the ring at a time. If your partner gets too beaten down to continue, they must tag you in before you can enter. The team member not currently in the ring must stay beside the designated corner. No interfering! The match ends when a legal participant is pinned or subdued. Only one member of the team has to be taken down \u2013 not both. As a reminder for everyone in the audience, even though tonight\u2019s match features the champion, the title is not up for grabs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither outcome, Ground Zero will keep his title,\u201d Aizawa said dully. \u201cHe has nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to lose but his pride!\u201d Mic corrected. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who threw down this challenge. He better see it through!\u201d</p><p>Izuku glanced across the ring. Kirishima already stood inside. Strange. If Bakugou was the one with something to prove, why didn\u2019t he start?</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it. The bell rang. Izuku forced himself not to jump into action; last time it didn\u2019t work out too well. Kirishima caught his eye and smiled as if he knew exactly what Izuku was thinking. \u201cCome on!\u201d Kirishima yelled. \u201cCome at me!\u201d</p><p>Before Izuku had a chance, Bakugou reached over the ropes and slapped Kirishima\u2019s shoulder. Kirishima\u2019s smile faltered.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re just going to mess with him, then I\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d Bakugou said, stepping into the ring.</p><p>\u201cGround Zero just tapped himself in!\u201d Mic said. \u201cSurprising, but technically not illegal!\u201d</p><p>Izuku\u2019s heart crawled into his chest. He\u2019d fought Kirishima before, but for the most part, Bakugou was a massive unknown to him. What moves did he like? What was his style? Was he analytical? Fast? Did he grapple, or strike?</p><p>Izuku didn\u2019t know any of that. All he knew was Bakugou was good enough to be the champion.</p><p>He needed more information.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wouldn\u2019t get it. Bakugou charged, locking Izuku up and shoving him into the corner. The turnbuckles pounded into his back. His neck snapped back, catching his head across the ropes.</p><p>Bakugou braced himself on the ropes, then delivered a powerful kick right into Izuku\u2019s stomach. Izuku lurched forward, folding in to protect himself. Another kick drove his shoulder into the turnbuckle. Bakugou took a running start and shoved his foot against Izuku\u2019s neck, pinning him in a choke against the ropes.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d the ref started to count. Bakugou could only hold Izuku there for a few seconds, or he would be disqualified. \u201cFour. Three. Two.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou released him. Izuku collapsed to the ground, coughing. Was this how Uraraka felt last week?</p><p>Before he could regroup his thoughts, Bakugou climbed to the top rope. In the back of his mind, Izuku knew he should move, but he couldn\u2019t find the strength to get out of the way. Bakugou jumped, landing with an elbow to Izuku\u2019s torso.</p><p>Bakugou pinned him against the mat, but Izuku kicked out. Bakugou rolled away, pushing his hair back, jaw clenched in frustration. He kicked Izuku in the back, turning him over. He stared at the ceiling. The lights really were blinding at this angle. He could hardly see Bakugou scale to the second rope and jump again.</p><p>On instinct, Izuku raised his knees.</p><p>Bakugou fell across Izuku\u2019s shins, reversing the attack. Bakugou struggled to sit up, clutching his side. Now was his chance. Izuku kicked Bakugou\u2019s shoulder, forcing him down. Izuku lifted his legs, pinning Bakugou underneath him.</p><p>\u201cOne! Two!\u201d Bakugou rolled out. Dammit. He still wasn\u2019t weak enough.</p><p>Before he could plot his next move, Bakugou whirled around, catching Izuku across the face with his elbow. Izuku collapsed, the world spinning.</p><p>\u201cIzuku needs to make a tag,\u201d Mic said.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s halfway across the ring,\u201d Aizawa said.</p><p>Izuku glanced up. Todoroki watched, still not fully engaged. His hand was free, ready to tag in if Izuku could make it to him, but Todoroki made no effort to cheer him on. Maybe what Bakugou said about his dad hit too close to home.</p><p>Todoroki looked like he\u2019d rather be anywhere but there.</p><p>Fine. If he didn\u2019t want in, then Izuku would figure it out himself. Bakugou rolled to the corner and tapped Kirishima\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGround Zero is out, Red Riot is legal!\u201d</p><p>Kirishima wasted no time. He swooped in, yanked Izuku to his feet and pulled him firefighter style over his shoulders. Izuku had no way to counter as Kirishima threw Izuku to the mat and crushed him. Kirishima turned Izuku onto his side and grabbed him by the arm and leg. He launched Izuku like a frisbee, throwing him across the ring.</p><p>Izuku\u2019s face slammed into the mat.</p><p>Everything hurt. He wasn\u2019t sure he could tell up from down or right from left. He could just barely make out Todoroki\u2019s expression. He wasn\u2019t too far away. But Todoroki still didn\u2019t look ready to tag in.</p><p>Izuku propped himself on his elbows. \u201cYou aren\u2019t just a legacy! You\u2019re your own person too!\u201d He shouted.</p><p>He had no way of knowing how he knew it. He just did. This was about Todoroki\u2019s father, somehow.</p><p>He must have hit a nerve, because Todoroki suddenly surged forward, holding out his hand, stretching as far as he could. Izuku tapped him in and rolled to the outside of the ring, finally able to catch his breath.</p><p>Izuku glanced up in time to see Todoroki sprint across the ring, clotheslining Kirishima. He fell hard to the mat, and before he could even get up, Todoroki slammed one foot between his shoulder blades, holding him down. He grabbed Kirishima\u2019s arm and lifted it up, twisting his elbow violently outward.</p><p>Kirishima tapped in submission almost immediately.</p><p>Present Mic fought to be heard over the ending bell. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us saw that coming! Man, I\u2019ve never seen him look that passionate about a match before!\u201d</p><p>The ref raised both Izuku and Todoroki\u2019s hands in the air. Kirishima and Bakugou retreated backstage, Kirishima holding his shoulder. Izuku hoped it wasn\u2019t dislocated.</p><p>Before Izuku could head back into the locker room, someone ducked beneath the ropes, microphone in hand. Not someone, exactly. He was small\u2026almost\u2026a rat?</p><p>\u201cIzuku Midoriya. We\u2019ve met,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Nedzu, the general manager here at the WWE. You\u2018ve impressed me tonight, so to celebrate your win, I\u2019m offering you a match you won\u2019t forget. You\u2019ll face a crowd favorite, Kaminari Denki \u2013 Charge Bolt! Extreme rules. Anything goes. Next week. Be there, or be caught unaware. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d</p></p>",

Kirishima had changed, now sporting black shorts and a tee shirt with \u2018Red Riot\u2019 emblazoned across the front.</p><p>\u201cWhere can we watch?\u201d Izuku pulled a clean shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a TV backstage.\u201d Kirishima nodded to the area behind the locker room. Izuku had seen it briefly on his way in; there were boxes upon boxes of sound equipment and gear. Between the women and men\u2019s locker rooms was a small sitting room with a mini-fridge, tables, and chairs. The TV was hooked directly to the cameras at ringside.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You don\u2019t want to miss the start.\u201d Kirishima prodded him.</p><p>Izuku closed his locker and followed Kirishima. A few others were already tuned in. Kaminari and Sero sat with their eyes glued to the TV. Todoroki stood in the corner, gnawing on a protein bar. He still looked disinterested in anything and everything.</p><p>Izuku took the chair next to Sero. He hadn\u2019t had the chance to meet Momo \u2013 Creati, as the fans called her \u2013 while he was backstage, but he recognized her the instant she appeared on the TV. Her long black ponytail had been her signature look since she debuted. She already stood in the ring, holding her championship belt for everyone to see.</p><p>\u201cDoes Uraraka have a chance?\u201d Kaminari whispered to Sero, who took a long sip from a water bottle before answering.</p><p>\u201cMomo\u2019s one of the smartest wrestlers to ever exist,\u201d Sero said, \u201cand Uraraka\u2019s still green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only been wrestling for a year,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cShe\u2019s talented, but her ring-sense needs work. Kinda like you.\u201d He nudged Izuku in the side.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Izuku agreed. He knew he had a lot to learn. But if Uraraka could make it to the championship match in less than a year, then so could he, right?</p><p>The camera panned to Uraraka. Brown tape circled her wrists. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a striking specialist. Trained with a martial art Olympian for a few years. The tape helps to protect her fingers and wrist.\u201d Kirishima answered.</p><p>The bell dinged and the entire room fell silent.</p><p>Momo circled Uraraka, gauging her strength. Uraraka raised her fists. For a moment, nothing happened.</p><p>Uraraka lunged. Momo caught her around the waist and lifted Uraraka over her shoulder. Momo threw her weight back, tossing Uraraka across the ring like a ragdoll. She landed hard on her back.</p><p>Momo wasted no time. She launched her body weight onto Uraraka\u2019s stomach. Uraraka flinched, but before she could roll away, Momo pinned her shoulders against the mat.</p><p>One count.</p><p>Uraraka twisted but couldn\u2019t free herself from Momo\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Two counts.</p><p>Uraraka kicked out, breaking the hold. She struck Momo\u2019s back and sent her sprawling. Uraraka rolled to her feet, braced herself against the ropes, and lashed out. Momo took three kick to the rib cage before she crawled out of Uraraka\u2019s range.</p><p>Maybe Uraraka had a better chance than the others gave her credit for.</p><p>Momo grabbed the ropes, hauling herself to her feet, one hand holding her battered ribs. Uraraka charged. As they collided, Momo latched onto her feet and shoved Uraraka over the top rope. Uraraka flew outside the ring, landing with a smack that echoed loud and clear on the concrete.</p><p>Everyone cringed. Kirishima let out a low whistle in sympathy. Even Todoroki blinked (Izuku chose to believe that was a form of emotion).</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gotta hurt.\u201d Present Mic\u2019s voice echoed over the loudspeakers.</p><p>\u201cSmart move on Creati\u2019s part, using Uravity\u2019s momentum against her. There was no stopping that.\u201d Aizawa, the far less enthusiastic announcer, commented.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s Creati planning now \u2013\u201d Present Mic stopped mid-sentence as Momo positioned herself in a corner of the ring, hands on the top rope. \u201cShe can\u2019t possibly be thinking of flying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to the top rope.\u201d Aizawa finished.</p><p>Momo stood on the top turnbuckle, knees bent. Uraraka lay face down on the floor, struggling to collect her breath. Momo launched herself off the top rope.</p><p>Her body slammed into Uraraka\u2019s, snapping her to the ground. Izuku was surprised it didn\u2019t break Uraraka in half.</p><p>Momo rolled off of her, clutching her ribs.</p><p>\u201cIt was a great move, but all eliminations have to occur inside the ring,\u201d Mic said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if either woman can get up before they\u2019re counted out!\u201d</p><p>Uraraka struggled to her feet, clutching the back of her neck. The tape on her left hand was unraveling, but she couldn\u2019t stop to fix it. Breathing hard, Uraraka grabbed Momo by the shoulder and drove her, injured ribs first, into the barricade. Momo crumpled to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThat might be it!\u201d Mic shouted. \u201cMomo isn\u2019t moving!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUravity still has to get her back in the ring for it to count,\u201d Aizawa said.</p><p>Uraraka wrapped Momo\u2019s ponytail around her hand, hooked her other hand around Momo\u2019s leg, and tossed her under the ropes. Momo\u2019s eyes were open, but she made no effort to move.</p><p>Uraraka dove in after her. Izuku felt a ray of hope explode in his chest. He couldn\u2019t put words to why he wanted Uraraka to win so badly, but he did. This was her chance. The champ was down. If she could pin Momo here \u2013</p><p>Uraraka lifted Momo\u2019s legs.</p><p>Before the referee even started the count, Momo exploded into action, flipping Uraraka around and wrapping her arm around Uraraka\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cShe locked in a choke hold!\u201d Kaminari almost jumped out of his seat.</p><p>\u201cBut she was barely able to move. How \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was faking,\u201d Todoroki said, interrupting Izuku in a monotone voice that froze his blood. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to anyone who\u2019s wrestled for a while. Momo faked it because she knew Uraraka would take the bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Uraraka going to tap?\u201d Sero asked, eyes locked onto the screen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gotta tap,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cMomo\u2019s got her locked in. There\u2019s no way she can fight her way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the middle of the ring, too,\u201d Sero said. \u201cShe can\u2019t get to the ropes to force a break.\u201d</p><p>Uraraka struggled, wiggling and slapping the air, but Momo kept the pressure on, twisting her neck slightly. The more Uraraka struggled, the more out of breath she got.</p><p>She coughed weakly.</p><p>\u201cShe has to tap.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s mouth hung open. \u201cShe\u2019ll pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Momo\u2019s win either way.\u201d Kaminari agreed. \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d</p><p>Uraraka tried to crawl to her knees, but Momo pushed her back down. Izuku held his breath. Uraraka stretched out her arm, reaching for the ropes, but they were still another arm\u2019s length away.</p><p>Her head dropped and she went limp.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The bell dinged and the refs pushed Momo away. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, your winner, retaining her championship title, Creati!\u201d</p><p>Uraraka stirred, sucking in a deep breath of air. She sat up, tears already in her eyes. She didn\u2019t even bother to raise Momo\u2019s hand. She pushed herself out of the ring and walked sullenly back down the ramp. A few fans tried to cheer her up as she passed, offering high-fives and cheers, but she didn\u2019t lift her head to see them.</p><p>\u201cTalk about bad sportsmanship.\u201d Mic huffed.</p><p>\u201cWe all know how much this match meant to Uravity,\u201d Aizawa said. For once, there was a hint of sympathy in his voice. \u201cI think she\u2019s upset at herself more than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Momo\u2019s fault she\u2019s the better wrestler! You still gotta pay respect where respect is due.\u201d Mic argued. \u201cUravity\u2019s asking for a feud, and there\u2019s no way she can handle Momo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say it out loud. I think tonight proved that just fine.\u201d Aizawa chided.</p><p>Before Izuku could hear Mic\u2019s response, the door to the lounge swang open. Uraraka walked through, realizing too late that it was occupied.</p><p>\u201cOchako \u2013\u201d Kirishima started.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she warned. She bit her lip, head dropping to the floor. Her hands dug into her hips. She shook her head, then turned and fled back the way she\u2019d come.</p><p>Izuku stood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go after her,\u201d Kirishima said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kirishima turned around to face Izuku. \u201cFor one, she\u2019s going into the women\u2019s locker room. Second, medical staff needs to check her after that knockout. And third, she needs time to process what just happened.\u201d</p><p>Izuku settled back into his chair. \u201cI want to make sure she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can. In a few minutes. And when, you know, she\u2019s not in the locker room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Once, this novice tried to get in there and Mina suplexed him through a mirror.\u201d Kaminari added.</p><p>\u201cHe was injured so badly he couldn\u2019t make his debut as \u2018grape rush,\u2019\u201d Sero added. \u201cIt was unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki deadpanned. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Izuku wasn\u2019t quite sure how to respond to that. Luckily for him, he didn\u2019t have to. On TV, another wrestler jumped the barricade and grabbed a mic.</p><p>Bakugou stood in the spotlight, the championship belt over his shoulder, reflecting dazzling rainbows through the crowd. \u201cAlright, alright, settle down.\u201d He shouted to be heard over the crowd. \u201cCreati had her moment. Really, good for her. But can we turn our attention back to what really matters now?\u201d</p><p>A few people tried to boo him, but they were drowned out as he continued. \u201cNow, people have this notion about being a pro wrestler; if you\u2019re a legacy or if you have the blessing of a champ, you\u2019ll somehow become the greatest of all time. And I, for one, have a problem with that. Because unlike some people here, I earned my spot on this roster without anyone\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>More boos rose from the crowd. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Kaminari asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s talking about someone.\u201d Kirishima made a pointed gesture behind them, where Todoroki still showed no interest in the TV.</p><p>\u201cAnd unlike other people, I want to prove to everyone here that I\u2019m the best, no matter what the legendary champions say.\u201d Bakugou ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cSo, this is my declaration of war. Todoroki Shouto and Midoriya Izuku; I\u2019m taking you two on in a tag team match. The two of you against Red Riot and I. We\u2019ll prove that wrestling has a new champ in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will?\u201d Kirishima almost fell out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know he was doing this?\u201d Sero asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t just challenge people like that, can he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the champion. He can do whatever he wants \u2013\u201d</p><p>Before Izuku could process what it meant, a second shadowy figure emerged from backstage. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot of talk for someone who\u2019s only held that belt for a week.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki appeared on screen. He was as monotone as ever. \u201cUnlike you,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t care what my father thinks of me or anyone else. If you genuinely believe I\u2019ve had opportunities handed to me because of my lineage, then you\u2019re crazier than I thought. Does this look like an opportunity to you?\u201d He pointed to the jagged scar across his eye.</p><p>\u201cI never had my dad\u2019s blessing to enter this arena. I made it here on my own will, same as you. But unlike you, I\u2019m not a jealous, ego-maniac who needs validation every step of the way. So I accept your challenge. And I\u2019ll prove to you that my parents mean nothing.\u201d</p><p>Izuku and Kirishima exchanged a look. \u201cI, uh\u2026 guess I\u2019ll see you next week.\u201d Kirishima finally said.</p><p>****</p><p>He couldn\u2019t return to the locker room out of fear that Bakugou would be waiting. Or, somehow even worse, Todoroki. At least Izuku had run into Bakugou before. Todoroki was a complete unknown. How could he team up with someone who wouldn\u2019t even talk to him?</p><p>Instead of the locker room, Izuku walked deeper backstage. Maybe he could find a place to clear his mind among the crates and boxes.</p><p>He ducked around a stack of merchandise and sank to the floor. \u201cYou come here to clear your head too?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. Uraraka sat against the wall. Her eyes were dry, but her cheeks were still red and puffy. \u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Bakugou\u2019s thinking, calling you out like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make a name for himself, I suppose.\u201d Izuku sighed. \u201cWe all are.\u201d</p><p>Uraraka leaned back, rubbing the red mark around her neck. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Izuku said suddenly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tap out?\u201d</p><p>She laughed drily. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give up. I knew I couldn\u2019t win, but I didn\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have gotten seriously hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cLook, the championship, it\u2019s more than a title to me. I didn\u2019t come from a wealthy family. They struggle to get by. I send them almost half of my paycheck every fight to keep them afloat. If I was champion, I\u2019d get more money, more opportunities. Maybe they\u2019d finally start making merch for me. Then\u2026then maybe I could invest, and then my parents wouldn\u2019t have to rely on me. I just need one push, and then I can help them out for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault. Can\u2019t blame Momo for wanting to keep the title. Sometimes you just get the short end of the stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>Uraraka pushed herself to her feet. \u201cI should probably go see how Momo\u2019s ribs are. Good luck next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I need it?\u201d</p><p>The half-smile, almost pitying, said it all.</p><p>****</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s theme song are we using?\u201d Izuku asked. No response. Todoroki stared straight ahead, unwavering.</p><p>\u201cWho should we have start out in the ring?\u201d Izuku tried again. Still, nothing.</p><p>One last time, he tried to ask, \u201cDo you want to go after Kirishima or Bakugou?\u201d</p><p>The speakers jumped to life. \u201cShowtime,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>Their entrance was hardly smooth. They tripped over each other, unsure of who was going which way, how fast to walk, or where the other was going. Izuku ended up trailing Todoroki like a sad puppy. He didn\u2019t know the theme song well and ended up offbeat.</p><p>Todoroki jumped onto the apron, remaining outside the ring. He waved his hand to Izuku, as if to say, get in.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the most\u2026oddball tag team match I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Mic announced. \u201cThe rules are simple. Each team has two people, but only one member per team can be in the ring at a time. If your partner gets too beaten down to continue, they must tag you in before you can enter. The team member not currently in the ring must stay beside the designated corner. No interfering! The match ends when a legal participant is pinned or subdued. Only one member of the team has to be taken down \u2013 not both. As a reminder for everyone in the audience, even though tonight\u2019s match features the champion, the title is not up for grabs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither outcome, Ground Zero will keep his title,\u201d Aizawa said dully. \u201cHe has nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to lose but his pride!\u201d Mic corrected. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who threw down this challenge. He better see it through!\u201d</p><p>Izuku glanced across the ring. Kirishima already stood inside. Strange. If Bakugou was the one with something to prove, why didn\u2019t he start?</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it. The bell rang. Izuku forced himself not to jump into action; last time it didn\u2019t work out too well. Kirishima caught his eye and smiled as if he knew exactly what Izuku was thinking. \u201cCome on!\u201d Kirishima yelled. \u201cCome at me!\u201d</p><p>Before Izuku had a chance, Bakugou reached over the ropes and slapped Kirishima\u2019s shoulder. Kirishima\u2019s smile faltered.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re just going to mess with him, then I\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d Bakugou said, stepping into the ring.</p><p>\u201cGround Zero just tapped himself in!\u201d Mic said. \u201cSurprising, but technically not illegal!\u201d</p><p>Izuku\u2019s heart crawled into his chest. He\u2019d fought Kirishima before, but for the most part, Bakugou was a massive unknown to him. What moves did he like? What was his style? Was he analytical? Fast? Did he grapple, or strike?</p><p>Izuku didn\u2019t know any of that. All he knew was Bakugou was good enough to be the champion.</p><p>He needed more information.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wouldn\u2019t get it. Bakugou charged, locking Izuku up and shoving him into the corner. The turnbuckles pounded into his back. His neck snapped back, catching his head across the ropes.</p><p>Bakugou braced himself on the ropes, then delivered a powerful kick right into Izuku\u2019s stomach. Izuku lurched forward, folding in to protect himself. Another kick drove his shoulder into the turnbuckle. Bakugou took a running start and shoved his foot against Izuku\u2019s neck, pinning him in a choke against the ropes.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d the ref started to count. Bakugou could only hold Izuku there for a few seconds, or he would be disqualified. \u201cFour. Three. Two.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou released him. Izuku collapsed to the ground, coughing. Was this how Uraraka felt last week?</p><p>Before he could regroup his thoughts, Bakugou climbed to the top rope. In the back of his mind, Izuku knew he should move, but he couldn\u2019t find the strength to get out of the way. Bakugou jumped, landing with an elbow to Izuku\u2019s torso.</p><p>Bakugou pinned him against the mat, but Izuku kicked out. Bakugou rolled away, pushing his hair back, jaw clenched in frustration. He kicked Izuku in the back, turning him over. He stared at the ceiling. The lights really were blinding at this angle. He could hardly see Bakugou scale to the second rope and jump again.</p><p>On instinct, Izuku raised his knees.</p><p>Bakugou fell across Izuku\u2019s shins, reversing the attack. Bakugou struggled to sit up, clutching his side. Now was his chance. Izuku kicked Bakugou\u2019s shoulder, forcing him down. Izuku lifted his legs, pinning Bakugou underneath him.</p><p>\u201cOne! Two!\u201d Bakugou rolled out. Dammit. He still wasn\u2019t weak enough.</p><p>Before he could plot his next move, Bakugou whirled around, catching Izuku across the face with his elbow. Izuku collapsed, the world spinning.</p><p>\u201cIzuku needs to make a tag,\u201d Mic said.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s halfway across the ring,\u201d Aizawa said.</p><p>Izuku glanced up. Todoroki watched, still not fully engaged. His hand was free, ready to tag in if Izuku could make it to him, but Todoroki made no effort to cheer him on. Maybe what Bakugou said about his dad hit too close to home.</p><p>Todoroki looked like he\u2019d rather be anywhere but there.</p><p>Fine. If he didn\u2019t want in, then Izuku would figure it out himself. Bakugou rolled to the corner and tapped Kirishima\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGround Zero is out, Red Riot is legal!\u201d</p><p>Kirishima wasted no time. He swooped in, yanked Izuku to his feet and pulled him firefighter style over his shoulders. Izuku had no way to counter as Kirishima threw Izuku to the mat and crushed him. Kirishima turned Izuku onto his side and grabbed him by the arm and leg. He launched Izuku like a frisbee, throwing him across the ring.</p><p>Izuku\u2019s face slammed into the mat.</p><p>Everything hurt. He wasn\u2019t sure he could tell up from down or right from left. He could just barely make out Todoroki\u2019s expression. He wasn\u2019t too far away. But Todoroki still didn\u2019t look ready to tag in.</p><p>Izuku propped himself on his elbows. \u201cYou aren\u2019t just a legacy! You\u2019re your own person too!\u201d He shouted.</p><p>He had no way of knowing how he knew it. He just did. This was about Todoroki\u2019s father, somehow.</p><p>He must have hit a nerve, because Todoroki suddenly surged forward, holding out his hand, stretching as far as he could. Izuku tapped him in and rolled to the outside of the ring, finally able to catch his breath.</p><p>Izuku glanced up in time to see Todoroki sprint across the ring, clotheslining Kirishima. He fell hard to the mat, and before he could even get up, Todoroki slammed one foot between his shoulder blades, holding him down. He grabbed Kirishima\u2019s arm and lifted it up, twisting his elbow violently outward.</p><p>Kirishima tapped in submission almost immediately.</p><p>Present Mic fought to be heard over the ending bell. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us saw that coming! Man, I\u2019ve never seen him look that passionate about a match before!\u201d</p><p>The ref raised both Izuku and Todoroki\u2019s hands in the air. Kirishima and Bakugou retreated backstage, Kirishima holding his shoulder. Izuku hoped it wasn\u2019t dislocated.</p><p>Before Izuku could head back into the locker room, someone ducked beneath the ropes, microphone in hand. Not someone, exactly. He was small\u2026almost\u2026a rat?</p><p>\u201cIzuku Midoriya. We\u2019ve met,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Nedzu, the general manager here at the WWE. You\u2018ve impressed me tonight, so to celebrate your win, I\u2019m offering you a match you won\u2019t forget. You\u2019ll face a crowd favorite, Kaminari Denki \u2013 Charge Bolt! Extreme rules. Anything goes. Next week. Be there, or be caught unaware. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><blockquote><p><b>Summary:&nbsp;</b>\n\nUraraka challenges Momo for the title of Women&rsquo;s Champion, Bakugou calls out one of the most reserved wrestlers in the league, and Izuku gets caught in the middle.\n\n</p><p><b>Rated T</b></p></blockquote><p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tag Team</b></p><p>&ldquo;Uraraka&rsquo;s about to face off for the title.&rdquo; Kirishima knocked his knuckles against Izuku&rsquo;s locker. Kirishima had changed, now sporting black shorts and a tee shirt with &lsquo;Red Riot&rsquo; emblazoned across the front.</p><p>&ldquo;Where can we watch?&rdquo; Izuku pulled a clean shirt over his head.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a TV backstage.&rdquo; Kirishima nodded to the area behind the locker room. Izuku had seen it briefly on his way in; there were boxes upon boxes of sound equipment and gear. Between the women and men&rsquo;s locker rooms was a small sitting room with a mini-fridge, tables, and chairs. The TV was hooked directly to the cameras at ringside.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on. You don&rsquo;t want to miss the start.&rdquo; Kirishima prodded him.</p><p>Izuku closed his locker and followed Kirishima. A few others were already tuned in. Kaminari and Sero sat with their eyes glued to the TV. Todoroki stood in the corner, gnawing on a protein bar. He still looked disinterested in anything and everything.</p><p>Izuku took the chair next to Sero. He hadn&rsquo;t had the chance to meet Momo &ndash; Creati, as the fans called her &ndash; while he was backstage, but he recognized her the instant she appeared on the TV. Her long black ponytail had been her signature look since she debuted. She already stood in the ring, holding her championship belt for everyone to see.</p><p>&ldquo;Does Uraraka have a chance?&rdquo; Kaminari whispered to Sero, who took a long sip from a water bottle before answering.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo&rsquo;s one of the smartest wrestlers to ever exist,&rdquo; Sero said, &ldquo;and Uraraka&rsquo;s still green.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only been wrestling for a year,&rdquo; Kirishima said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s talented, but her ring-sense needs work. Kinda like you.&rdquo; He nudged Izuku in the side.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Izuku agreed. He knew he had a lot to learn. But if Uraraka could make it to the championship match in less than a year, then so could he, right?</p><p>The camera panned to Uraraka. Brown tape circled her wrists. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a striking specialist. Trained with a martial art Olympian for a few years. The tape helps to protect her fingers and wrist.&rdquo; Kirishima answered.</p><p>The bell dinged and the entire room fell silent.</p><p>Momo circled Uraraka, gauging her strength. Uraraka raised her fists. For a moment, nothing happened.</p><p>Uraraka lunged. Momo caught her around the waist and lifted Uraraka over her shoulder. Momo threw her weight back, tossing Uraraka across the ring like a ragdoll. She landed hard on her back.</p><p>Momo wasted no time. She launched her body weight onto Uraraka&rsquo;s stomach. Uraraka flinched, but before she could roll away, Momo pinned her shoulders against the mat.</p><p>One count.</p><p>Uraraka twisted but couldn&rsquo;t free herself from Momo&rsquo;s grasp.</p><p>Two counts.</p><p>Uraraka kicked out, breaking the hold. She struck Momo&rsquo;s back and sent her sprawling. Uraraka rolled to her feet, braced herself against the ropes, and lashed out. Momo took three kick to the rib cage before she crawled out of Uraraka&rsquo;s range.</p><p>Maybe Uraraka had a better chance than the others gave her credit for.</p><p>Momo grabbed the ropes, hauling herself to her feet, one hand holding her battered ribs. Uraraka charged. As they collided, Momo latched onto her feet and shoved Uraraka over the top rope. Uraraka flew outside the ring, landing with a smack that echoed loud and clear on the concrete.</p><p>Everyone cringed. Kirishima let out a low whistle in sympathy. Even Todoroki blinked (Izuku chose to believe that was a form of emotion).</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s gotta hurt.&rdquo; Present Mic&rsquo;s voice echoed over the loudspeakers.</p><p>&ldquo;Smart move on Creati&rsquo;s part, using Uravity&rsquo;s momentum against her. There was no stopping that.&rdquo; Aizawa, the far less enthusiastic announcer, commented.</p><p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s Creati planning now &ndash;&rdquo; Present Mic stopped mid-sentence as Momo positioned herself in a corner of the ring, hands on the top rope. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t possibly be thinking of flying!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to the top rope.&rdquo; Aizawa finished.</p><p>Momo stood on the top turnbuckle, knees bent. Uraraka lay face down on the floor, struggling to collect her breath. Momo launched herself off the top rope.</p><p>Her body slammed into Uraraka&rsquo;s, snapping her to the ground. Izuku was surprised it didn&rsquo;t break Uraraka in half.</p><p>Momo rolled off of her, clutching her ribs.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a great move, but all eliminations have to occur inside the ring,&rdquo; Mic said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if either woman can get up before they&rsquo;re counted out!&rdquo;</p><p>Uraraka struggled to her feet, clutching the back of her neck. The tape on her left hand was unraveling, but she couldn&rsquo;t stop to fix it. Breathing hard, Uraraka grabbed Momo by the shoulder and drove her, injured ribs first, into the barricade. Momo crumpled to the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;That might be it!&rdquo; Mic shouted. &ldquo;Momo isn&rsquo;t moving!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uravity still has to get her back in the ring for it to count,&rdquo; Aizawa said.</p><p>Uraraka wrapped Momo&rsquo;s ponytail around her hand, hooked her other hand around Momo&rsquo;s leg, and tossed her under the ropes. Momo&rsquo;s eyes were open, but she made no effort to move.</p><p>Uraraka dove in after her. Izuku felt a ray of hope explode in his chest. He couldn&rsquo;t put words to why he wanted Uraraka to win so badly, but he did. This was her chance. The champ was down. If she could pin Momo here &ndash;</p><p>Uraraka lifted Momo&rsquo;s legs.</p><p>Before the referee even started the count, Momo exploded into action, flipping Uraraka around and wrapping her arm around Uraraka&rsquo;s throat.</p><p>&ldquo;She locked in a choke hold!&rdquo; Kaminari almost jumped out of his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;But she was barely able to move. How &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was faking,&rdquo; Todoroki said, interrupting Izuku in a monotone voice that froze his blood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious to anyone who&rsquo;s wrestled for a while. Momo faked it because she knew Uraraka would take the bait.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is Uraraka going to tap?&rdquo; Sero asked, eyes locked onto the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gotta tap,&rdquo; Kirishima said. &ldquo;Momo&rsquo;s got her locked in. There&rsquo;s no way she can fight her way out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the middle of the ring, too,&rdquo; Sero said. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t get to the ropes to force a break.&rdquo;</p><p>Uraraka struggled, wiggling and slapping the air, but Momo kept the pressure on, twisting her neck slightly. The more Uraraka struggled, the more out of breath she got.</p><p>She coughed weakly.</p><p>&ldquo;She has to tap.&rdquo; Kirishima&rsquo;s mouth hung open. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll pass out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Momo&rsquo;s win either way.&rdquo; Kaminari agreed. &ldquo;What is she doing?&rdquo;</p><p>Uraraka tried to crawl to her knees, but Momo pushed her back down. Izuku held his breath. Uraraka stretched out her arm, reaching for the ropes, but they were still another arm&rsquo;s length away.</p><p>Her head dropped and she went limp.</p><p>The bell dinged and the refs pushed Momo away. &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, your winner, retaining her championship title, Creati!&rdquo;</p><p>Uraraka stirred, sucking in a deep breath of air. She sat up, tears already in her eyes. She didn&rsquo;t even bother to raise Momo&rsquo;s hand. She pushed herself out of the ring and walked sullenly back down the ramp. A few fans tried to cheer her up as she passed, offering high-fives and cheers, but she didn&rsquo;t lift her head to see them.</p><p>&ldquo;Talk about bad sportsmanship.&rdquo; Mic huffed.</p><p>&ldquo;We all know how much this match meant to Uravity,&rdquo; Aizawa said. For once, there was a hint of sympathy in his voice. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s upset at herself more than anyone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Momo&rsquo;s fault she&rsquo;s the better wrestler! You still gotta pay respect where respect is due.&rdquo; Mic argued. &ldquo;Uravity&rsquo;s asking for a feud, and there&rsquo;s no way she can handle Momo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to say it out loud. I think tonight proved that just fine.&rdquo; Aizawa chided.</p><p>Before Izuku could hear Mic&rsquo;s response, the door to the lounge swang open. Uraraka walked through, realizing too late that it was occupied.</p><p>&ldquo;Ochako &ndash;&rdquo; Kirishima started.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she warned. She bit her lip, head dropping to the floor. Her hands dug into her hips. She shook her head, then turned and fled back the way she&rsquo;d come.</p><p>Izuku stood.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go after her,&rdquo; Kirishima said.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Kirishima turned around to face Izuku. &ldquo;For one, she&rsquo;s going into the women&rsquo;s locker room. Second, medical staff needs to check her after that knockout. And third, she needs time to process what just happened.&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku settled back into his chair. &ldquo;I want to make sure she&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you can. In a few minutes. And when, you know, she&rsquo;s not in the locker room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Once, this novice tried to get in there and Mina suplexed him through a mirror.&rdquo; Kaminari added.</p><p>&ldquo;He was injured so badly he couldn&rsquo;t make his debut as &lsquo;grape rush,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sero added. &ldquo;It was unfortunate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Todoroki deadpanned. &ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku wasn&rsquo;t quite sure how to respond to that. Luckily for him, he didn&rsquo;t have to. On TV, another wrestler jumped the barricade and grabbed a mic.</p><p>Bakugou stood in the spotlight, the championship belt over his shoulder, reflecting dazzling rainbows through the crowd. &ldquo;Alright, alright, settle down.&rdquo; He shouted to be heard over the crowd. &ldquo;Creati had her moment. Really, good for her. But can we turn our attention back to what really matters now?&rdquo;</p><p>A few people tried to boo him, but they were drowned out as he continued. &ldquo;Now, people have this notion about being a pro wrestler; if you&rsquo;re a legacy or if you have the blessing of a champ, you&rsquo;ll somehow become the greatest of all time. And I, for one, have a problem with that. Because unlike some people here, I earned my spot on this roster without anyone&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p><p>More boos rose from the crowd. &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; Kaminari asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s talking about someone.&rdquo; Kirishima made a pointed gesture behind them, where Todoroki still showed no interest in the TV.</p><p>&ldquo;And unlike other people, I want to prove to everyone here that I&rsquo;m the best, no matter what the legendary champions say.&rdquo; Bakugou ran his tongue over his teeth. &ldquo;So, this is my declaration of war. Todoroki Shouto and Midoriya Izuku; I&rsquo;m taking you two on in a tag team match. The two of you against Red Riot and I. We&rsquo;ll prove that wrestling has a new champ in town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We will?&rdquo; Kirishima almost fell out of his chair.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know he was doing this?&rdquo; Sero asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t just challenge people like that, can he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the champion. He can do whatever he wants &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Before Izuku could process what it meant, a second shadowy figure emerged from backstage. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lot of talk for someone who&rsquo;s only held that belt for a week.&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki appeared on screen. He was as monotone as ever. &ldquo;Unlike you,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what my father thinks of me or anyone else. If you genuinely believe I&rsquo;ve had opportunities handed to me because of my lineage, then you&rsquo;re crazier than I thought. Does this look like an opportunity to you?&rdquo; He pointed to the jagged scar across his eye.</p><p>&ldquo;I never had my dad&rsquo;s blessing to enter this arena. I made it here on my own will, same as you. But unlike you, I&rsquo;m not a jealous, ego-maniac who needs validation every step of the way. So I accept your challenge. And I&rsquo;ll prove to you that my parents mean nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku and Kirishima exchanged a look. &ldquo;I, uh&hellip; guess I&rsquo;ll see you next week.&rdquo; Kirishima finally said.</p><p>****</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t return to the locker room out of fear that Bakugou would be waiting. Or, somehow even worse, Todoroki. At least Izuku had run into Bakugou before. Todoroki was a complete unknown. How could he team up with someone who wouldn&rsquo;t even talk to him?</p><p>Instead of the locker room, Izuku walked deeper backstage. Maybe he could find a place to clear his mind among the crates and boxes.</p><p>He ducked around a stack of merchandise and sank to the floor. &ldquo;You come here to clear your head too?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked up. Uraraka sat against the wall. Her eyes were dry, but her cheeks were still red and puffy. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Izuku said.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Bakugou&rsquo;s thinking, calling you out like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to make a name for himself, I suppose.&rdquo; Izuku sighed. &ldquo;We all are.&rdquo;</p><p>Uraraka leaned back, rubbing the red mark around her neck. &ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; Izuku said suddenly. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tap out?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed drily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to give up. I knew I couldn&rsquo;t win, but I didn&rsquo;t want to admit it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could have gotten seriously hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Uraraka said. &ldquo;Look, the championship, it&rsquo;s more than a title to me. I didn&rsquo;t come from a wealthy family. They struggle to get by. I send them almost half of my paycheck every fight to keep them afloat. If I was champion, I&rsquo;d get more money, more opportunities. Maybe they&rsquo;d finally start making merch for me. Then&hellip;then maybe I could invest, and then my parents wouldn&rsquo;t have to rely on me. I just need one push, and then I can help them out for good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault. It&rsquo;s not anyone&rsquo;s fault. Can&rsquo;t blame Momo for wanting to keep the title. Sometimes you just get the short end of the stick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; Izuku said.</p><p>Uraraka pushed herself to her feet. &ldquo;I should probably go see how Momo&rsquo;s ribs are. Good luck next week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will I need it?&rdquo;</p><p>The half-smile, almost pitying, said it all.</p><p>****</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s theme song are we using?&rdquo; Izuku asked. No response. Todoroki stared straight ahead, unwavering.</p><p>&ldquo;Who should we have start out in the ring?&rdquo; Izuku tried again. Still, nothing.</p><p>One last time, he tried to ask, &ldquo;Do you want to go after Kirishima or Bakugou?&rdquo;</p><p>The speakers jumped to life. &ldquo;Showtime,&rdquo; Todoroki said.</p><p>Their entrance was hardly smooth. They tripped over each other, unsure of who was going which way, how fast to walk, or where the other was going. Izuku ended up trailing Todoroki like a sad puppy. He didn&rsquo;t know the theme song well and ended up offbeat.</p><p>Todoroki jumped onto the apron, remaining outside the ring. He waved his hand to Izuku, as if to say, get in.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to the most&hellip;oddball tag team match I&rsquo;ve ever seen!&rdquo; Mic announced. &ldquo;The rules are simple. Each team has two people, but only one member per team can be in the ring at a time. If your partner gets too beaten down to continue, they must tag you in before you can enter. The team member not currently in the ring must stay beside the designated corner. No interfering! The match ends when a legal participant is pinned or subdued. Only one member of the team has to be taken down &ndash; not both. As a reminder for everyone in the audience, even though tonight&rsquo;s match features the champion, the title is not up for grabs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Either outcome, Ground Zero will keep his title,&rdquo; Aizawa said dully. &ldquo;He has nothing to lose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing to lose but his pride!&rdquo; Mic corrected. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one who threw down this challenge. He better see it through!&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku glanced across the ring. Kirishima already stood inside. Strange. If Bakugou was the one with something to prove, why didn&rsquo;t he start?</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t have time to dwell on it. The bell rang. Izuku forced himself not to jump into action; last time it didn&rsquo;t work out too well. Kirishima caught his eye and smiled as if he knew exactly what Izuku was thinking. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Kirishima yelled. &ldquo;Come at me!&rdquo;</p><p>Before Izuku had a chance, Bakugou reached over the ropes and slapped Kirishima&rsquo;s shoulder. Kirishima&rsquo;s smile faltered.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re just going to mess with him, then I&rsquo;ll do it myself,&rdquo; Bakugou said, stepping into the ring.</p><p>&ldquo;Ground Zero just tapped himself in!&rdquo; Mic said. &ldquo;Surprising, but technically not illegal!&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku&rsquo;s heart crawled into his chest. He&rsquo;d fought Kirishima before, but for the most part, Bakugou was a massive unknown to him. What moves did he like? What was his style? Was he analytical? Fast? Did he grapple, or strike?</p><p>Izuku didn&rsquo;t know any of that. All he knew was Bakugou was good enough to be the champion.</p><p>He needed more information.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wouldn&rsquo;t get it. Bakugou charged, locking Izuku up and shoving him into the corner. The turnbuckles pounded into his back. His neck snapped back, catching his head across the ropes.</p><p>Bakugou braced himself on the ropes, then delivered a powerful kick right into Izuku&rsquo;s stomach. Izuku lurched forward, folding in to protect himself. Another kick drove his shoulder into the turnbuckle. Bakugou took a running start and shoved his foot against Izuku&rsquo;s neck, pinning him in a choke against the ropes.</p><p>&ldquo;Five,&rdquo; the ref started to count. Bakugou could only hold Izuku there for a few seconds, or he would be disqualified. &ldquo;Four. Three. Two.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou released him. Izuku collapsed to the ground, coughing. Was this how Uraraka felt last week?</p><p>Before he could regroup his thoughts, Bakugou climbed to the top rope. In the back of his mind, Izuku knew he should move, but he couldn&rsquo;t find the strength to get out of the way. Bakugou jumped, landing with an elbow to Izuku&rsquo;s torso.</p><p>Bakugou pinned him against the mat, but Izuku kicked out. Bakugou rolled away, pushing his hair back, jaw clenched in frustration. He kicked Izuku in the back, turning him over. He stared at the ceiling. The lights really were blinding at this angle. He could hardly see Bakugou scale to the second rope and jump again.</p><p>On instinct, Izuku raised his knees.</p><p>Bakugou fell across Izuku&rsquo;s shins, reversing the attack. Bakugou struggled to sit up, clutching his side. Now was his chance. Izuku kicked Bakugou&rsquo;s shoulder, forcing him down. Izuku lifted his legs, pinning Bakugou underneath him.</p><p>&ldquo;One! Two!&rdquo; Bakugou rolled out. Dammit. He still wasn&rsquo;t weak enough.</p><p>Before he could plot his next move, Bakugou whirled around, catching Izuku across the face with his elbow. Izuku collapsed, the world spinning.</p><p>&ldquo;Izuku needs to make a tag,&rdquo; Mic said.</p><p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s halfway across the ring,&rdquo; Aizawa said.</p><p>Izuku glanced up. Todoroki watched, still not fully engaged. His hand was free, ready to tag in if Izuku could make it to him, but Todoroki made no effort to cheer him on. Maybe what Bakugou said about his dad hit too close to home.</p><p>Todoroki looked like he&rsquo;d rather be anywhere but there.</p><p>Fine. If he didn&rsquo;t want in, then Izuku would figure it out himself. Bakugou rolled to the corner and tapped Kirishima&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Ground Zero is out, Red Riot is legal!&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima wasted no time. He swooped in, yanked Izuku to his feet and pulled him firefighter style over his shoulders. Izuku had no way to counter as Kirishima threw Izuku to the mat and crushed him. Kirishima turned Izuku onto his side and grabbed him by the arm and leg. He launched Izuku like a frisbee, throwing him across the ring.</p><p>Izuku&rsquo;s face slammed into the mat.</p><p>Everything hurt. He wasn&rsquo;t sure he could tell up from down or right from left. He could just barely make out Todoroki&rsquo;s expression. He wasn&rsquo;t too far away. But Todoroki still didn&rsquo;t look ready to tag in.</p><p>Izuku propped himself on his elbows. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t just a legacy! You&rsquo;re your own person too!&rdquo; He shouted.</p><p>He had no way of knowing how he knew it. He just did. This was about Todoroki&rsquo;s father, somehow.</p><p>He must have hit a nerve, because Todoroki suddenly surged forward, holding out his hand, stretching as far as he could. Izuku tapped him in and rolled to the outside of the ring, finally able to catch his breath.</p><p>Izuku glanced up in time to see Todoroki sprint across the ring, clotheslining Kirishima. He fell hard to the mat, and before he could even get up, Todoroki slammed one foot between his shoulder blades, holding him down. He grabbed Kirishima&rsquo;s arm and lifted it up, twisting his elbow violently outward.</p><p>Kirishima tapped in submission almost immediately.</p><p>Present Mic fought to be heard over the ending bell. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of us saw that coming! Man, I&rsquo;ve never seen him look that passionate about a match before!&rdquo;</p><p>The ref raised both Izuku and Todoroki&rsquo;s hands in the air. Kirishima and Bakugou retreated backstage, Kirishima holding his shoulder. Izuku hoped it wasn&rsquo;t dislocated.</p><p>Before Izuku could head back into the locker room, someone ducked beneath the ropes, microphone in hand. Not someone, exactly. He was small&hellip;almost&hellip;a rat?</p><p>&ldquo;Izuku Midoriya. We&rsquo;ve met,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nedzu, the general manager here at the WWE. You&lsquo;ve impressed me tonight, so to celebrate your win, I&rsquo;m offering you a match you won&rsquo;t forget. You&rsquo;ll face a crowd favorite, Kaminari Denki &ndash; Charge Bolt! Extreme rules. Anything goes. Next week. Be there, or be caught unaware. Don&rsquo;t disappoint me.&rdquo;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Summary:&nbsp;</b>\n\nUraraka challenges Momo for the title of Women&rsquo;s Champion, Bakugou calls out one of the most reserved wrestlers in the league, and Izuku gets caught in the middle.\n\n</p>\n<p><b>Rated T</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tag Team</b></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uraraka&rsquo;s about to face off for the title.&rdquo; Kirishima knocked his knuckles against Izuku&rsquo;s locker. Kirishima had changed, now sporting black shorts and a tee shirt with &lsquo;Red Riot&rsquo; emblazoned across the front.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where can we watch?&rdquo; Izuku pulled a clean shirt over his head.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a TV backstage.&rdquo; Kirishima nodded to the area behind the locker room. Izuku had seen it briefly on his way in; there were boxes upon boxes of sound equipment and gear. Between the women and men&rsquo;s locker rooms was a small sitting room with a mini-fridge, tables, and chairs. The TV was hooked directly to the cameras at ringside.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come on. You don&rsquo;t want to miss the start.&rdquo; Kirishima prodded him.</p>\n<p>Izuku closed his locker and followed Kirishima. A few others were already tuned in. Kaminari and Sero sat with their eyes glued to the TV. Todoroki stood in the corner, gnawing on a protein bar. He still looked disinterested in anything and everything.</p>\n<p>Izuku took the chair next to Sero. He hadn&rsquo;t had the chance to meet Momo &ndash; Creati, as the fans called her &ndash; while he was backstage, but he recognized her the instant she appeared on the TV. Her long black ponytail had been her signature look since she debuted. She already stood in the ring, holding her championship belt for everyone to see.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Does Uraraka have a chance?&rdquo; Kaminari whispered to Sero, who took a long sip from a water bottle before answering.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Momo&rsquo;s one of the smartest wrestlers to ever exist,&rdquo; Sero said, &ldquo;and Uraraka&rsquo;s still green.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only been wrestling for a year,&rdquo; Kirishima said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s talented, but her ring-sense needs work. Kinda like you.&rdquo; He nudged Izuku in the side.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Izuku agreed. He knew he had a lot to learn. But if Uraraka could make it to the championship match in less than a year, then so could he, right?</p>\n<p>The camera panned to Uraraka. Brown tape circled her wrists. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a striking specialist. Trained with a martial art Olympian for a few years. The tape helps to protect her fingers and wrist.&rdquo; Kirishima answered.</p>\n<p>The bell dinged and the entire room fell silent.</p>\n<p>Momo circled Uraraka, gauging her strength. Uraraka raised her fists. For a moment, nothing happened.</p>\n<p>Uraraka lunged. Momo caught her around the waist and lifted Uraraka over her shoulder. Momo threw her weight back, tossing Uraraka across the ring like a ragdoll. She landed hard on her back.</p>\n<p>Momo wasted no time. She launched her body weight onto Uraraka&rsquo;s stomach. Uraraka flinched, but before she could roll away, Momo pinned her shoulders against the mat.</p>\n<p>One count.</p>\n<p>Uraraka twisted but couldn&rsquo;t free herself from Momo&rsquo;s grasp.</p>\n<p>Two counts.</p>\n<p>Uraraka kicked out, breaking the hold. She struck Momo&rsquo;s back and sent her sprawling. Uraraka rolled to her feet, braced herself against the ropes, and lashed out. Momo took three kick to the rib cage before she crawled out of Uraraka&rsquo;s range.</p>\n<p>Maybe Uraraka had a better chance than the others gave her credit for.</p>\n<p>Momo grabbed the ropes, hauling herself to her feet, one hand holding her battered ribs. Uraraka charged. As they collided, Momo latched onto her feet and shoved Uraraka over the top rope. Uraraka flew outside the ring, landing with a smack that echoed loud and clear on the concrete.</p>\n<p>Everyone cringed. Kirishima let out a low whistle in sympathy. Even Todoroki blinked (Izuku chose to believe that was a form of emotion).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s gotta hurt.&rdquo; Present Mic&rsquo;s voice echoed over the loudspeakers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Smart move on Creati&rsquo;s part, using Uravity&rsquo;s momentum against her. There was no stopping that.&rdquo; Aizawa, the far less enthusiastic announcer, commented.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s Creati planning now &ndash;&rdquo; Present Mic stopped mid-sentence as Momo positioned herself in a corner of the ring, hands on the top rope. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t possibly be thinking of flying!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to the top rope.&rdquo; Aizawa finished.</p>\n<p>Momo stood on the top turnbuckle, knees bent. Uraraka lay face down on the floor, struggling to collect her breath. Momo launched herself off the top rope.</p>\n<p>Her body slammed into Uraraka&rsquo;s, snapping her to the ground. Izuku was surprised it didn&rsquo;t break Uraraka in half.</p>\n<p>Momo rolled off of her, clutching her ribs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a great move, but all eliminations have to occur inside the ring,&rdquo; Mic said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if either woman can get up before they&rsquo;re counted out!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Uraraka struggled to her feet, clutching the back of her neck. The tape on her left hand was unraveling, but she couldn&rsquo;t stop to fix it. Breathing hard, Uraraka grabbed Momo by the shoulder and drove her, injured ribs first, into the barricade. Momo crumpled to the floor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That might be it!&rdquo; Mic shouted. &ldquo;Momo isn&rsquo;t moving!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uravity still has to get her back in the ring for it to count,&rdquo; Aizawa said.</p>\n<p>Uraraka wrapped Momo&rsquo;s ponytail around her hand, hooked her other hand around Momo&rsquo;s leg, and tossed her under the ropes. Momo&rsquo;s eyes were open, but she made no effort to move.</p>\n<p>Uraraka dove in after her. Izuku felt a ray of hope explode in his chest. He couldn&rsquo;t put words to why he wanted Uraraka to win so badly, but he did. This was her chance. The champ was down. If she could pin Momo here &ndash;</p>\n<p>Uraraka lifted Momo&rsquo;s legs.</p>\n<p>Before the referee even started the count, Momo exploded into action, flipping Uraraka around and wrapping her arm around Uraraka&rsquo;s throat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She locked in a choke hold!&rdquo; Kaminari almost jumped out of his seat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But she was barely able to move. How &ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She was faking,&rdquo; Todoroki said, interrupting Izuku in a monotone voice that froze his blood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious to anyone who&rsquo;s wrestled for a while. Momo faked it because she knew Uraraka would take the bait.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is Uraraka going to tap?&rdquo; Sero asked, eyes locked onto the screen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gotta tap,&rdquo; Kirishima said. &ldquo;Momo&rsquo;s got her locked in. There&rsquo;s no way she can fight her way out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the middle of the ring, too,&rdquo; Sero said. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t get to the ropes to force a break.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Uraraka struggled, wiggling and slapping the air, but Momo kept the pressure on, twisting her neck slightly. The more Uraraka struggled, the more out of breath she got.</p>\n<p>She coughed weakly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She has to tap.&rdquo; Kirishima&rsquo;s mouth hung open. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll pass out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Momo&rsquo;s win either way.&rdquo; Kaminari agreed. &ldquo;What is she doing?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Uraraka tried to crawl to her knees, but Momo pushed her back down. Izuku held his breath. Uraraka stretched out her arm, reaching for the ropes, but they were still another arm&rsquo;s length away.</p>\n<p>Her head dropped and she went limp.</p>\n</p>",
