So you let some Xhorhasians get through, get deeper behind the border than they\u2019ve ever been. Let them destroy your tower, steal the thing, and after they have made such a spectacle you kill them and take it back- except neither have it.

You also know he\u2019s a coward, and won\u2019t get involved in this war. So you let him keep it, there is nothing you can get from the thing now.\u00a0</p><p>With the Tower broken, it only takes a bit more to tip over the scales.

You are the archmage of civil influence *cough* propaganda *cough*. You&rsquo;re Trent Ikithon and an evil son of a bitch. And suddenly, the mages you work with have come back with an object that can control time. Not truly, but once a day, those that have it can change one thing. And you are fascinated. Imagine what your weapons could do with the power to wield&nbsp;time? An enemy hit attacks them? Rewind! Their own attack misses? Rewind! So you start dedicating your weapons to this- and also, start sending them into Xhorhas to find more.&nbsp;</p><p>A few Xhorhasians come and break into the Empire, but you don&rsquo;t let them get far.
