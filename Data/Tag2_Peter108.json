He witnessed the door swing open and Tony emerged, in his nanotech undersuit.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked, urgently getting ready to press his chest plate. He quickly dropped his hand though as Peter was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cUp here,\u201d Peter called, trying to pull up a hand to wave in his direction.

To no avail though. \u201cThis has happened before.\u201d He informed the engineer, as the man got a stool and stood on it, getting level with Peter\u2019s face.

To no avail though. &ldquo;This has happened before.&rdquo; He informed the engineer, as the man got a stool and stood on it, getting level with Peter&rsquo;s face. He reached up and started to pull at the kid&rsquo;s hand, trying to rip it free. </p><p>&ldquo;Ow ow ow, okay stop!&rdquo; Peter called, swatting Tony&rsquo;s hand away as soon as he felt his skin rip. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t going to work.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony huffed and got off the stool, putting his hands on his hips, in thought. This was tricky.</p><p>&ldquo;I call the doctor.&rdquo; He announced, taking out his phone and immediately going into his contacts.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to get him to calm down,&rdquo; Stephen said, once he was over there and examine the stuck boy.</p><p>&ldquo;How do we do that?&rdquo; Tony asked, crossing his arms. His worry began to show over time as he stood under Peter in case he suddenly fell without warning. </p><p>&ldquo;What calms you down, Peter?&rdquo; Stephen asked, rising to look into Parker&rsquo;s eyes. Peter thought for a moment and nodded silently.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I think I got it.&rdquo; He said, and Stephen descended back to the ground to give Peter some room. Peter closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, trying his best to clear his mind. Tony watched intently, getting ready to catch the boy if need be. The cloak was also at the ready. Suddenly Peter became unstuck and fell right into Tony&rsquo;s arm, making him fall over as well, the cloak quickly caught the both of them before they did too much damage.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice one, Pete,&rdquo; Tony said, a little out of breath. Peter smiled sheepishly as he got to his feet, helping Tony to his as well.</p><p>&ldquo;What had thought of?&rdquo; Stephen asked as the cloak returned to his shoulders. Peter went silent once again and kicked the ground nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up, by Rick Astley.&rdquo; He mumbled.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony sighed exasperatedly and pressed his hand to his face.</p>",

Ned bursts out laughing and MJ gives a small smile, the usual reaction to Peter\u2019s dumb jokes, but this time Y/N laughs out loud. Peter\u2019s eyes widen.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYeah! It was so crazy.\u201d Peter says, looking at Y/N who was still snickering. She laughed at his joke. She never does that. She usually sits quietly on her phone, sometimes she show MJ something that they\u2019ll quietly talk about, but she never laughed at Peters jokes.</p><p>This was a step in the right direction in Peter\u2019s eyes. The lunch period goes on normally, but each time Peter makes a joke, she laughs. This goes on for a while. Each time Peter says a joke around her, she\u2019ll laugh. </p><hr><p>\u201cGuys! Come on it\u2019ll be so much fun!\u201d Peter yells, tring to convince his friends to go ice skating with him.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the cold.\u201d MJ says, not looking up from her phone. </p><p>\u201cMy mom said no.\u201d Ned says, a devious smile. Y/N looks up from her phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been ice skating. I kinda want to try.\u201d Y/N says quietly. Oh. </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Peter asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go with you, if you want?\u201d Y/N offers. Peter feels heat crawl up his neck and onto his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do it. How\u2019s tomorrow? I\u2019ll pick you up at 7?\u201d Peter says, his voice an octave higher. Peter\u2019s hearing allows him to hear Ned try and stifle a giggle. He watches as MJ glares over at Ned.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Y/N says before looking back down at her phone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, good.\u201d</p><hr><p>7 P.M. rolls around and Peter finds himself outside of the apartment building that Y/N gave him the address to. He walks in and texts her telling him his in the lobby, and after a few minutes he sees her enter the lobby. </p><p>\u201cAlright let\u2019s do this!\u201d Peter smiles. The cool air of the night keeps the heat off Peter\u2019s cheeks as they walk slowly towards the rink. The silence is awkward at first, but after a block, Peter finds himself enjoying the quiet companionship.</p><p>When the arrive at the rink, it\u2019s loud and Peter expects Y/N to visibly hate it, but instead a bright smile flashes from her lips. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t have skates, so we have to rent them.\u201d Peter says, to which Y/N nods. They walk over and tell the man their sizes and he brings them over and gives the price. Peter quickly pulls out his wallet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d He mutters. </p><p>\u201cNo come on let\u2019s split it.\u201d Y/N argues. Peter ignores her request and hands the man the money.</p><p>\u201cYou can pay next time.\u201d Peter smiles. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for food later, because I\u2019m already hungry.\u201d Y/N groans. Peter immediately realizes what happened. </p><p>Ned and MJ set him up on a date! With Y/N! </p><p>His mind races. Why did they do that? Does Y/N know? Did Y/N ask them to do this? Does Y/N like him? Does he like Y/N? </p><p>Peter must have been standing there long enough without responding, because Y/N tries to retract her statement.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get food if you don\u2019t want to. I just thought, because I\u2019m hungry it would be a good idea but,\u201d Y/N rambles.</p><p>\u201cNo, I could eat after this.\u201d Peter says, to calm Y/N\u2019s nerves. Where did that instinct come from? Y/N lets out a relieved sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay good, it\u2019s only fair I pay for something,\u201d Y/N laughs. Peter smiles and sits down on a bench to put his skates on. Y/N sits next to him, and their legs touch. Peter feels his cheeks heat up again, but Y/N quickly shifts away from him and mutters a quiet apology.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter says, and he notices and light blush and Y/N\u2019s cheeks. Once the skates are on, the pair makes their way over to the rink, where Peter quickly hops onto the ice, balancing perfectly. Y/N however looks like a baby deer, attempting to walk for the first time. Before Peter can realizes what he\u2019s doing, he grabs Y/N\u2019s waist to help stabilize her. She must not mind, because not only does she not push his hands away, but she grabs onto his arms. </p><p>\u201cThis is harder than I thought.\u201d Y/N huffs, still holding onto to Peter. He notices how adorable she looks with a determined look on her face. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Takes a minute to get the hang out it.\u201d Peter smiles.</p><p>\u201cWell how are you so good at this!\u201d Y/N exclaims. Peter knows it\u2019s because of his spider powers, but Y/N doesn\u2019t know about Spider-Man.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ve done it before.\u201d Peter mutters. Y/N huffs again and tries to skate without holding on to Peter. He follows closely behind her, and when she feels like she\u2019s about to fall, she quickly turns around and reaches out for Peter.</p><p>\u201cHelp.\u201d Y/N laughs and Peter wraps his arms around her waist again. She, only for a second, rests her head on his chest. Peter can help but think about how much he enjoyed that feeling. He unwraps his arms from her middle and grabs hold of her hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it slow, okay?\u201d Peter whispers. She nods, hugging his arm, to keep herself up. </p><p>After an hour of skating around, and an hour of Y/N being very close to Peter, she decides she\u2019s too hungry to go on. They decide on a place and after returning their skates, slowly walk to the place. Peter misses the warmth of her body right next to his as the walk.</p><p>He almost wants to reach over and grab her hand, just like he had in the ice, but now he couldn\u2019t play it off as trying to help her. It would only help him, and his wants, so he keeps his arm by his side. </p><p>They walk for a few more minutes before Y/N grabs a hold of Peter\u2019s hand. He\u2019s almost shocked, but quickly grabs back, moving his thumb over the back of her hand, back and forth. Peter really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but he knows he enjoys it.</p><p>When they get to the pizza place, Peter allows Y/N to pay, and they sit down and eat their food. The conversation is light and quiet, but Peter finds himself enjoying it, a lot. She laughs at his jokes again, and makes some of her own, which Peter laughs at as well. Nothing feels forced, or difficult and Peter just allows the conversation to roam to the topics Y/N wants to talk about. </p><p>\u201cOkay, I need to say something, and it\u2019s going to be hard for me to say, but I want to tell the truth.\u201d Y/N smiles. </p><p>\u201cOkay shoot.\u201d Peter says. Y/N inhales deeply.</p><p>\u201cI like you and I had a lot of fun tonight.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s heart stops.</p><p>\u201cI like you too.\u201d </p><p>Y/N\u2019s smile widens to nearly blinding level. </p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s do this again sometime.\u201d Y/N smiles.</p><p>\u201cOf course, with you it\u2019s never wasted time.\u201d </p>",

It was so crazy.\u201d Peter says, looking at Y/N who was still snickering. She laughed at his joke. She never does that. She usually sits quietly on her phone, sometimes she show MJ something that they\u2019ll quietly talk about, but she never laughed at Peters jokes.</p><p>This was a step in the right direction in Peter\u2019s eyes. The lunch period goes on normally, but each time Peter makes a joke, she laughs. This goes on for a while. Each time Peter says a joke around her, she\u2019ll laugh. </p><hr><p>\u201cGuys! Come on it\u2019ll be so much fun!\u201d Peter yells, tring to convince his friends to go ice skating with him.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the cold.\u201d MJ says, not looking up from her phone. </p><p>\u201cMy mom said no.\u201d Ned says, a devious smile. Y/N looks up from her phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been ice skating. I kinda want to try.\u201d Y/N says quietly. Oh. </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Peter asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go with you, if you want?\u201d Y/N offers. Peter feels heat crawl up his neck and onto his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do it. How\u2019s tomorrow? I\u2019ll pick you up at 7?\u201d Peter says, his voice an octave higher. Peter\u2019s hearing allows him to hear Ned try and stifle a giggle. He watches as MJ glares over at Ned.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Y/N says before looking back down at her phone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, good.\u201d</p><hr><p>7 P.M. rolls around and Peter finds himself outside of the apartment building that Y/N gave him the address to. He walks in and texts her telling him his in the lobby, and after a few minutes he sees her enter the lobby. </p><p>\u201cAlright let\u2019s do this!\u201d Peter smiles. The cool air of the night keeps the heat off Peter\u2019s cheeks as they walk slowly towards the rink. The silence is awkward at first, but after a block, Peter finds himself enjoying the quiet companionship.</p><p>When the arrive at the rink, it\u2019s loud and Peter expects Y/N to visibly hate it, but instead a bright smile flashes from her lips. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t have skates, so we have to rent them.\u201d Peter says, to which Y/N nods. They walk over and tell the man their sizes and he brings them over and gives the price. Peter quickly pulls out his wallet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d He mutters. </p><p>\u201cNo come on let\u2019s split it.\u201d Y/N argues. Peter ignores her request and hands the man the money.</p><p>\u201cYou can pay next time.\u201d Peter smiles. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for food later, because I\u2019m already hungry.\u201d Y/N groans. Peter immediately realizes what happened. </p><p>Ned and MJ set him up on a date! With Y/N! </p><p>His mind races. Why did they do that? Does Y/N know? Did Y/N ask them to do this? Does Y/N like him? Does he like Y/N? </p><p>Peter must have been standing there long enough without responding, because Y/N tries to retract her statement.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get food if you don\u2019t want to. I just thought, because I\u2019m hungry it would be a good idea but,\u201d Y/N rambles.</p><p>\u201cNo, I could eat after this.\u201d Peter says, to calm Y/N\u2019s nerves. Where did that instinct come from? Y/N lets out a relieved sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay good, it\u2019s only fair I pay for something,\u201d Y/N laughs. Peter smiles and sits down on a bench to put his skates on. Y/N sits next to him, and their legs touch. Peter feels his cheeks heat up again, but Y/N quickly shifts away from him and mutters a quiet apology.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter says, and he notices and light blush and Y/N\u2019s cheeks. Once the skates are on, the pair makes their way over to the rink, where Peter quickly hops onto the ice, balancing perfectly. Y/N however looks like a baby deer, attempting to walk for the first time. Before Peter can realizes what he\u2019s doing, he grabs Y/N\u2019s waist to help stabilize her. She must not mind, because not only does she not push his hands away, but she grabs onto his arms. </p><p>\u201cThis is harder than I thought.\u201d Y/N huffs, still holding onto to Peter. He notices how adorable she looks with a determined look on her face. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Takes a minute to get the hang out it.\u201d Peter smiles.</p><p>\u201cWell how are you so good at this!\u201d Y/N exclaims. Peter knows it\u2019s because of his spider powers, but Y/N doesn\u2019t know about Spider-Man.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ve done it before.\u201d Peter mutters. Y/N huffs again and tries to skate without holding on to Peter. He follows closely behind her, and when she feels like she\u2019s about to fall, she quickly turns around and reaches out for Peter.</p><p>\u201cHelp.\u201d Y/N laughs and Peter wraps his arms around her waist again. She, only for a second, rests her head on his chest. Peter can help but think about how much he enjoyed that feeling. He unwraps his arms from her middle and grabs hold of her hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it slow, okay?\u201d Peter whispers. She nods, hugging his arm, to keep herself up. </p><p>After an hour of skating around, and an hour of Y/N being very close to Peter, she decides she\u2019s too hungry to go on. They decide on a place and after returning their skates, slowly walk to the place. Peter misses the warmth of her body right next to his as the walk.</p><p>He almost wants to reach over and grab her hand, just like he had in the ice, but now he couldn\u2019t play it off as trying to help her. It would only help him, and his wants, so he keeps his arm by his side. </p><p>They walk for a few more minutes before Y/N grabs a hold of Peter\u2019s hand. He\u2019s almost shocked, but quickly grabs back, moving his thumb over the back of her hand, back and forth. Peter really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but he knows he enjoys it.</p><p>When they get to the pizza place, Peter allows Y/N to pay, and they sit down and eat their food. The conversation is light and quiet, but Peter finds himself enjoying it, a lot. She laughs at his jokes again, and makes some of her own, which Peter laughs at as well. Nothing feels forced, or difficult and Peter just allows the conversation to roam to the topics Y/N wants to talk about. </p><p>\u201cOkay, I need to say something, and it\u2019s going to be hard for me to say, but I want to tell the truth.\u201d Y/N smiles. </p><p>\u201cOkay shoot.\u201d Peter says. Y/N inhales deeply.</p><p>\u201cI like you and I had a lot of fun tonight.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s heart stops.</p><p>\u201cI like you too.\u201d </p><p>Y/N\u2019s smile widens to nearly blinding level. </p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s do this again sometime.\u201d Y/N smiles.</p><p>\u201cOf course, with you it\u2019s never wasted time.\u201d </p>",

She smiled listening to this and as I said, I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile back. <br/>We finally reached my apartment and I let her enter inside and gave her a seat on the couch. <br/>&ldquo;May, we have a guest!&rdquo; I yelled. <br/>And Soon May came in. Y/n stood up seeing her. <br/>&ldquo;May, this is Y/n&rdquo;, I introduced her. <br/>&ldquo;Nice to meet you&rdquo;, Y/n said smiling. <br/>And May gave her a small hug. <br/>&ldquo;So Peter finally got a girlfriend&rdquo;, she said. <br/>&ldquo;Oh no no no&hellip;&rdquo;, I came in front of her. <br/>&ldquo;We-We are just friends!&rdquo; I said. Oh gosh, these elderly people really embarrass you sometimes, but I felt a tingling sensation in my belly. Were those butterflies?<br/>&ldquo;Yeah, Peter and I, we are friends&rdquo;! Y/n said.<br/>&ldquo;Okay, got it, young fellas, grab some snacks, and relax&rdquo;, she said, giving a smile and walked inside her room. <br/>&ldquo;So, what do you want to eat?&rdquo; I asked. <br/>&ldquo;Oh come on, just grab anything you like and show me your legos,&rdquo; she said.<br/>&ldquo;Ah, okay, I see&rdquo;, I said, picking up some chips packs and making our way to my room. <br/>&ldquo;Your room, it&rsquo;s full of so many machines!&rdquo; She said as she brushed her fingers over my gadgets. <br/>&ldquo;Just a hobby,&rdquo; I said, shrugging as I took out some lego sets. She instantly got extremely excited seeing it and grabbed the box. Her hand brushed mine and I dropped the box. Her touch ran sparks through me.</p><p><i>What the hell is happening to me???</i></p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;, she asked as she picked up the box. <br/>&ldquo;Yea-Yeah, everything&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; I said, taking a deep breath.<br/>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I had to ask you something!&rdquo; she exclaimed all of a sudden.<br/>&ldquo;Yeah what?&rdquo; I asked, and she took a seat on my bed, and I took a seat beside her. <br/>&ldquo;I told you, that I met Spider-man yesterday and there&rsquo;s a weird&hellip; thing I noticed&rdquo;, she said in a serious tone, making me a little afraid.<br/>&ldquo;W-what is it?&rdquo; I stuttered after a long time. <br/>&ldquo;He knew my name, although I never told him that, plus he even knows that I study with you&rdquo;, she said. <br/>&ldquo;Wh-what that?&rdquo; I could feel a drop of sweat dripping down my forehead.<br/>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; I exclaimed, making her a little shook as I got an idea.<br/>&ldquo;Remember when I asked you if you were attending Liz&rsquo;s party? Spider-man was actually swinging above our heads at that time&rdquo;, I said, acting serious and she was listening carefully to my made up the story. <br/>I continued, &ldquo;After you were gone, he came to me and asked, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that beautiful girl you were talking to?&rsquo; and I told him about you, simple!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, really?&rdquo; She slapped her head.<br/>&ldquo;And I thought he studied in our school!&rdquo; She said, chuckling.</p><p><i>Awww</i><i>&hellip; She </i>looked so<i> cute doing that&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;But wait, what? Did he call me beautiful? Are you sure he said that?&rdquo; She said, getting up. <br/>&ldquo;Yeah, I am sure he said that maybe he likes you,&rdquo; I said, looking at her, more starring, as my voice got softer at the end. <br/>&ldquo;We just met yesterday Peter and I don&rsquo;t even know who he is? Also, LET&rsquo;S PLAY WITH LEGOOOOOOSSS!!!&rdquo; She said, kind of yelled, smiling, as she opened the lego box.</p><p><i>Did I just really flirt with her?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, Peter&hellip;&rdquo; She yelled, getting me off my thoughts.<br/>&ldquo;Huh? Yeah?&hellip;&rdquo; I said, shaking my head. <br/>&ldquo;Were you lost?&rdquo; She asked, chuckling.<br/>&ldquo;Nothing, it&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; I fake shrugged and we started, building Legos.</p><p>Time flew by. She came here at 4 pm &amp; it&rsquo;s already 8 pm&hellip; Woww!! <br/>I didn&rsquo;t even realize it. I feel so good, talking and playing with her.</p><p><i>I really never felt this type of connection with anyone.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god Peter, you didn&rsquo;t remind me of the time!&rdquo; She said, gathering the legos and the bags of chips. I was just starring her, keeping my head on my hand. <br/>&ldquo;At least help me clean these things, what the hell are you lost it?&rdquo; She said again, just then I jerked up and tried to help her.</p><p><i>What the hell is wrong with me?</i><br/></p><p>Finally, we packed the leftover legos and kept the prepared model carefully on the table. And then it was her time to leave. <br/>&ldquo;If you want, you can have dinner with us?&rdquo;, I tried to make her stay a little more. <br/>&ldquo;Well,&hellip; hmm.. Actually, I ate way too many chips, so I don&rsquo;t think I could eat anything else.&rdquo; She said, touching her belly. <br/>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said, pressing my lips as she left.</p><p>I think I should at least ensure that she reaches her home safely, so I put on my Spider-Man suit and followed her silently&hellip; Until at one point, she stopped and started talking to a bald, old, mysterious man.<br/>I couldn&rsquo;t hear what they were talking about, as I was a bit far. But then,&hellip; another person came.

Are you sure he said that?&rdquo; She said, getting up. <br />&ldquo;Yeah, I am sure he said that maybe he likes you,&rdquo; I said, looking at her, more starring, as my voice got softer at the end. <br />&ldquo;We just met yesterday Peter and I don&rsquo;t even know who he is? Also, LET&rsquo;S PLAY WITH LEGOOOOOOSSS!!!&rdquo; She said, kind of yelled, smiling, as she opened the lego box.</p><p><i>Did I just really flirt with her?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, Peter&hellip;&rdquo; She yelled, getting me off my thoughts.<br />&ldquo;Huh? Yeah?&hellip;&rdquo; I said, shaking my head. <br />&ldquo;Were you lost?&rdquo; She asked, chuckling.<br />&ldquo;Nothing, it&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; I fake shrugged and we started, building Legos.</p><p>Time flew by. She came here at 4 pm &amp; it&rsquo;s already 8 pm&hellip; Woww!! <br />I didn&rsquo;t even realize it. I feel so good, talking and playing with her.</p><p><i>I really never felt this type of connection with anyone.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god Peter, you didn&rsquo;t remind me of the time!&rdquo; She said, gathering the legos and the bags of chips. I was just starring her, keeping my head on my hand. <br />&ldquo;At least help me clean these things, what the hell are you lost it?&rdquo; She said again, just then I jerked up and tried to help her.</p><p><i>What the hell is wrong with me?</i><br /></p><p>Finally, we packed the leftover legos and kept the prepared model carefully on the table. And then it was her time to leave. <br />&ldquo;If you want, you can have dinner with us?&rdquo;, I tried to make her stay a little more. <br />&ldquo;Well,&hellip; hmm.. Actually, I ate way too many chips, so I don&rsquo;t think I could eat anything else.&rdquo; She said, touching her belly. <br />&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said, pressing my lips as she left.</p><p>I think I should at least ensure that she reaches her home safely, so I put on my Spider-Man suit and followed her silently&hellip; Until at one point, she stopped and started talking to a bald, old, mysterious man.<br />I couldn&rsquo;t hear what they were talking about, as I was a bit far. But then,&hellip; another person came. And he looked familiar.</p><p>&ldquo;Karen, zoom in on that guy please,&rdquo; I ordered my AI and so she did. <br />I glanced at that other guy and only two words left my mouth: &ldquo;Doctor Strange?!&rdquo;&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0134c8f00678b9adf0d6b5a2d047870/tumblr_inline_po9wrcBElv1wsc5ww_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>(TBC) (SORRY FOR LATE UPDATE) (ALSO, </b><b>OMGGGZZZZ</b><b> WHAT IS HAPPENING TO </b><b>PETER</b><b>?)(AND DOCTOR STRANGE?)&#128558;</b></p><p><b>TAGLIST WILL BE ADDED ON THE REPOSTED PART..!</b></p></p>",

You weren\u2019t mad at her. You actually understood what she was going through - you lost your father and boyfriend. But what you didn\u2019t understand, why didn\u2019t she try harder to find them? I mean, she was the head of\u00a0one of the most influential companies in the world. You thought she could do more.<br/></p><p>One year passed and you still heard nothing and got no information. You tried, with Fridays help, to get a signal - any signal to find both of them. You were as smart as your dad, if not even smarter, so it was easy for you to hack into every system of his and modify it, but still no results.\u00a0</p><p>When you weren\u2019t searching for Peter, your dad or the other missing people in your family and half the humanity - you trained, non stop. At first you trained by yourself to gain strength but after a while you invented a system where you would be in extrem situations like your dad was. You trained to be a Hero like him.</p><p>You trained downstairs in your dads lab, which you transformed into your personal gym, bed room and <i>your</i> lab. So you wouldn\u2019t get distracted while you looked for everyone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMs. Stark, a call for you.\u201d Friday said.<br/></p><p>\u201cNot now, you see that I\u2019m training.\u201d You replied.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Parker.\u201d<br/></p><p>The only reason you\u2019d stop and get out of the House was May Parker. May became a huge part in your life after Peter\u00a0disappeared. May was there for you when no one else was or maybe could. She always had hope and was one of the reasons why you kept looking for them.</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ll be there in 30 Minutes.\u201d You told Friday and stopped the training system.<br/></p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b> \u00a0 \u00a0~*~</b></b>\n\n<br/></p><p>When you came to the house, you took a deep breath. Today was the day everyone vanished one year ago, but you still remembered the day as it was just yesterday.</p><p>May saw you through the kitchen widow, but waited patiently for you to be ready to come inside. She knew that also three years ago Peter introduced you to Aunt May and his home for the first. It was one of the luckiest days you remembered.</p><p>You took a step forward and knocked on her door. May opened it with a small smile and let you in. She closed the door. May felt your heavy heart as soon as she looked at you. Even when you usually hid your emotions, may could always see through your walls.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to eat?\u201d She asked with a smile.<br/></p><p>You nodded.\u00a0\u201cI have to use the bathroom. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>You went near the bathroom, but when you saw Peter&rsquo;s door, you opened it and went into his room. It was still like he never left. His scent was also still in his room.\u00a0</p><p>You went to his wardrobe and got one of his hoodies. You put it on and sat down on his bed. You smiled soft as you remembered the first time you stayed over, he was so nervous and it was so important to him that you\u2019d feel at home but what he didn\u2019t know was, whenever you were with him you felt at home. Tears rolled down your face.\u00a0</p><p>May knocked on the door.\u00a0\u201cHey sweetie, thought you\u2019d be sitting here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him.\u201d You sobbed. May came in front of you and wiped your tears away.<br/></p><p>\n\nShe nodded. \u201cI miss him too,\u201d May took gently your hand and saw the bruises.\u00a0\u201cand I know your mad but we have to face the facts - It\u2019s just me and you.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/052943303115baa3e2851a371968138c/tumblr_inline_po9piapMGI1to74h4_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\"/></figure><p>\n\nYou had to cry more. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why everyone stopped looking for them. The Avengers -\u201d\n\n<br/></p><p>\u201c-The Avengers, or what is left of them, do what they can. But they have to keep the world together, not only we\u2019ve lost people we love.\u201d<br/></p><p>You knew she was right but you were angry all the time. You trained so hard because you thought that, if you were trained and a Hero, you could\u2019ve done more to prevent Thanos\u2019s Snap. Maybe Peter and your dad would still be with you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be there for you and you for me, okay? We won\u2019t lose our hope but we\u2019ve to keep going. Especially you, you\u2019re such a smart young woman and I swear your dad would kick your ass, if you\u2019d give that up and look for them all your life.\u201d<br/></p><p>May\u2019s words hurt you but they were true. After dinner and some talking you walked back home.</p><p>As soon as you got home you started training again.</p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> \u00a0 ~*~</b></b>\n\n<br/></p><p>Four years passed since half of the humanity vanished. More than four years since you hadn\u2019t heard anything from Peter or your dad. Months since you had a real conversation with your Mom. Days since you\u2019ve talked to May.</p><p>Time had no meaning for you anymore. You were smarter than half the school, so you stopped going one day. You finished your education at home and had no interst in going to college.\u00a0</p><p>You felt like everybody gave up and you were so disappointed, that you stopped sharing your tech to find someone, and did everything on your own. You stopped sharing anything with anyone, neither the Avengers could reach you anymore.</p><p>Bruce tried a couple times to hack Friday but you weren\u2019t your dad. Your software stopped being easy to hack, a few months after they left. Steve was knocking on your door a couple times but you were an angry teenager which developed to an even more angry woman and Natasha, Natasha knew when to let go.</p><p>You wanted to be left alone until you finished what you started. Your own, Iron suit. All the training, the endless fights and bruises until you felt worthy enough to wear a suit like your fathers. <b><a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/fe/4c/18fe4ca926219c545f9832f7ab42324b.jpg\">(X)</a></b></p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b> \u00a0 ~*~</b></b>\n\n<br/></p><p>You made everyone believe that you stopped caring about the world when the love of your life and your father vanished from it, but the truth was you had an eye on it everyday. You noticed that more crimes happened, that there wasn\u2019t enough police and the Avengers were overwhelmed by everything still.</p><p>You wanted to continue the legend your father began, to help people all around the world but to do it as good as him, you needed the time to build your suit as perfect as you could. You needed the time to be the best version of yourself.</p><p>You went over to May and wanted to show her you work but as you knocked, she stood in front of you with red eyes, May cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d You asked as you walked inside.<br/></p><p>May didn\u2019t know how to tell you and sat down.\u00a0\u201cI want to have a funeral for Peter but I don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d She was stressed.\u00a0\u201cPrices for funerals tripled as half of the existence disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Your heart broke. A funeral. Now, where you built your suit she lost hope&hellip;\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease Y/N, I need this. I need to move on, it\u2019s been four years.\u201d She started crying again.\u00a0\u201cI need to move on.\u201d<br/></p><p>It was like she was asking for your permission. You understood why she needed it, but it still hurt you. You nodded and wrapped her into your arms. It made you think.</p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> \u00a0~*~</b></b>\n\n<br/></p><p>After May fell asleep on the couch, you went home. Seeing her like this made you realize what you\u2019ve missed all those years. Your friends and the part of your family that was still left. You were so deep into your work that the world moved on but you didn\u2019t. You were so focused on being as good or even better than your father, because you believed this would be the only chance on how to find them, that you missed being there for anyone else. You lost yourself and didn\u2019t noticed the world around you.</p><p>You walked into your lab. \u201cFriday, I need everything we found out the last four years and I need you to send it to the Avengers. Now.\u201d You commanded.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Ms. Stark?\u201d Friday asked.\u00a0\u201cI remember you saying, that we never give anyone any information we have.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve done this sooner.\u201d You admitted.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll need my suit and I\u2019ll be gone. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back home so make sure that no one gets in here while I\u2019m gone.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d<br/></p><p>You put on your suit and flew to the Avengers Tower.</p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> \u00a0~*~</b></b>\n\n<br/></p><p>As soon as you were on the grounds of the Avengers Facility, the security system, designed by your father, aimed at you. You smirked.</p><p>\u201cFriday, lets find out how well I wasted my time.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You flew directly to the guns, challenged everything that shot at you and destroyed everything that got in the way. Also, you had immediately ideas for better safety systems.</p><p>Cap came out, followed by Nat and Hulk ready to fight. You landed in front of them and put down your suit. It had also Nanotech.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d They asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Steve was confused.<br/></p><p>You went over to Hulk and took gently his hand.\u00a0\u201cHey big guy.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cI need to talk to Bruce, if its alright with you.\u201d Hulk nodded and turned into Banner.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re confused and I\u2019m sorry for the way I treated all of you.

The suit and the research?\u201d Bruce asked.\u00a0\u201cThis is huge, Y/N!\u201d Bruce was amazed by all your work and all the information you\u2019ve got.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat is all of this?\u201d Steve questioned.<br/></p><p>\u201cI tried developed many systems and programs, a lot failed, more than I like to admit but I think I\u2019ve something that could help us find them, or at least a way to undo the Snap. But I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d Steve asked. You noticed that he was very disappointed by you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMay was always the one who believed Peter would come back. As long as she had hope, I had it too. Now she wants a funeral.\u201d You sat down.\u00a0\u201cI know I left you alone and I know I probably don\u2019t deserve a second chance but I understand that what I did was wrong. I just didn\u2019t know how to move on and I was so angry at all of you because I thought you had already lost all hope.\u201d<br/></p><p>Natasha seemed to be the only one who was not mad. She understood what you must\u2019ve been going through and she knew that everyone deserved a second chance. After all, you were just a kid. She pushed Steve gently.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Steve let out and wrapped his arms around you. You smiled and tried not to cry. You really had no idea how much you\u2019ve missed them.\u00a0\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave again.\u201d He said and didn\u2019t want to let go.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLady Stark, what was your idea?\u201d Thor asked as he came into the room and Cap let go of you.<br/></p><p>\u201cTo copy the Infinity Stones, at least a few.\u201d You replied and they looked confused at you.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve Information about Visions Stone, the Mind Stone. A hell of a lot. T\u2019Challas sister did well. We also have information about Wanda\u2019s Powers and about the Tesseract, the space stone. With my Programm and our minds, we can definitely do it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou want to undo it by creating more of them?\u201d Steve was obviously not liking your idea.\u00a0\u201cWhat if they get in the wrong hands?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N is right, Steve. I tried everything and I always get to the point where we need a stone to fight Thanos.

You weren\u2019t mad at her. You actually understood what she was going through - you lost your father and boyfriend. But what you didn\u2019t understand, why didn\u2019t she try harder to find them? I mean, she was the head of\u00a0one of the most influential companies in the world. You thought she could do more.<br></p><p>One year passed and you still heard nothing and got no information. You tried, with Fridays help, to get a signal - any signal to find both of them. You were as smart as your dad, if not even smarter, so it was easy for you to hack into every system of his and modify it, but still no results.\u00a0</p><p>When you weren\u2019t searching for Peter, your dad or the other missing people in your family and half the humanity - you trained, non stop. At first you trained by yourself to gain strength but after a while you invented a system where you would be in extrem situations like your dad was. You trained to be a Hero like him.</p><p>You trained downstairs in your dads lab, which you transformed into your personal gym, bed room and <i>your</i> lab. So you wouldn\u2019t get distracted while you looked for everyone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMs. Stark, a call for you.\u201d Friday said.<br></p><p>\u201cNot now, you see that I\u2019m training.\u201d You replied.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Parker.\u201d<br></p><p>The only reason you\u2019d stop and get out of the House was May Parker. May became a huge part in your life after Peter\u00a0disappeared. May was there for you when no one else was or maybe could. She always had hope and was one of the reasons why you kept looking for them.</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ll be there in 30 Minutes.\u201d You told Friday and stopped the training system.<br></p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b> \u00a0 \u00a0~*~</b></b>\n\n<br></p><p>When you came to the house, you took a deep breath. Today was the day everyone vanished one year ago, but you still remembered the day as it was just yesterday.</p><p>May saw you through the kitchen widow, but waited patiently for you to be ready to come inside. She knew that also three years ago Peter introduced you to Aunt May and his home for the first. It was one of the luckiest days you remembered.</p><p>You took a step forward and knocked on her door. May opened it with a small smile and let you in. She closed the door. May felt your heavy heart as soon as she looked at you. Even when you usually hid your emotions, may could always see through your walls.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to eat?\u201d She asked with a smile.<br></p><p>You nodded.\u00a0\u201cI have to use the bathroom. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>You went near the bathroom, but when you saw Peter\u2019s door, you opened it and went into his room. It was still like he never left. His scent was also still in his room.\u00a0</p><p>You went to his wardrobe and got one of his hoodies. You put it on and sat down on his bed. You smiled soft as you remembered the first time you stayed over, he was so nervous and it was so important to him that you\u2019d feel at home but what he didn\u2019t know was, whenever you were with him you felt at home. Tears rolled down your face.\u00a0</p><p>May knocked on the door.\u00a0\u201cHey sweetie, thought you\u2019d be sitting here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him.\u201d You sobbed. May came in front of you and wiped your tears away.<br></p><p>\n\nShe nodded. \u201cI miss him too,\u201d May took gently your hand and saw the bruises.\u00a0\u201cand I know your mad but we have to face the facts - It\u2019s just me and you.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/052943303115baa3e2851a371968138c/tumblr_inline_po9piapMGI1to74h4_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\"></figure><p>\n\nYou had to cry more. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why everyone stopped looking for them. The Avengers -\u201d\n\n<br></p><p>\u201c-The Avengers, or what is left of them, do what they can. But they have to keep the world together, not only we\u2019ve lost people we love.\u201d<br></p><p>You knew she was right but you were angry all the time. You trained so hard because you thought that, if you were trained and a Hero, you could\u2019ve done more to prevent Thanos\u2019s Snap. Maybe Peter and your dad would still be with you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be there for you and you for me, okay? We won\u2019t lose our hope but we\u2019ve to keep going. Especially you, you\u2019re such a smart young woman and I swear your dad would kick your ass, if you\u2019d give that up and look for them all your life.\u201d<br></p><p>May\u2019s words hurt you but they were true. After dinner and some talking you walked back home.</p><p>As soon as you got home you started training again.</p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> \u00a0 ~*~</b></b>\n\n<br></p><p>Four years passed since half of the humanity vanished. More than four years since you hadn\u2019t heard anything from Peter or your dad. Months since you had a real conversation with your Mom. Days since you\u2019ve talked to May.</p><p>Time had no meaning for you anymore. You were smarter than half the school, so you stopped going one day. You finished your education at home and had no interst in going to college.\u00a0</p><p>You felt like everybody gave up and you were so disappointed, that you stopped sharing your tech to find someone, and did everything on your own. You stopped sharing anything with anyone, neither the Avengers could reach you anymore.</p><p>Bruce tried a couple times to hack Friday but you weren\u2019t your dad. Your software stopped being easy to hack, a few months after they left. Steve was knocking on your door a couple times but you were an angry teenager which developed to an even more angry woman and Natasha, Natasha knew when to let go.</p><p>You wanted to be left alone until you finished what you started. Your own, Iron suit. All the training, the endless fights and bruises until you felt worthy enough to wear a suit like your fathers. <b><a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/fe/4c/18fe4ca926219c545f9832f7ab42324b.jpg\">(X)</a></b></p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b> \u00a0 ~*~</b></b>\n\n<br></p><p>You made everyone believe that you stopped caring about the world when the love of your life and your father vanished from it, but the truth was you had an eye on it everyday. You noticed that more crimes happened, that there wasn\u2019t enough police and the Avengers were overwhelmed by everything still.</p><p>You wanted to continue the legend your father began, to help people all around the world but to do it as good as him, you needed the time to build your suit as perfect as you could. You needed the time to be the best version of yourself.</p><p>You went over to May and wanted to show her you work but as you knocked, she stood in front of you with red eyes, May cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d You asked as you walked inside.<br></p><p>May didn\u2019t know how to tell you and sat down.\u00a0\u201cI want to have a funeral for Peter but I don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d She was stressed.\u00a0\u201cPrices for funerals tripled as half of the existence disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Your heart broke. A funeral. Now, where you built your suit she lost hope\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease Y/N, I need this. I need to move on, it\u2019s been four years.\u201d She started crying again.\u00a0\u201cI need to move on.\u201d<br></p><p>It was like she was asking for your permission. You understood why she needed it, but it still hurt you. You nodded and wrapped her into your arms. It made you think.</p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> \u00a0~*~</b></b>\n\n<br></p><p>After May fell asleep on the couch, you went home. Seeing her like this made you realize what you\u2019ve missed all those years. Your friends and the part of your family that was still left. You were so deep into your work that the world moved on but you didn\u2019t. You were so focused on being as good or even better than your father, because you believed this would be the only chance on how to find them, that you missed being there for anyone else. You lost yourself and didn\u2019t noticed the world around you.</p><p>You walked into your lab. \u201cFriday, I need everything we found out the last four years and I need you to send it to the Avengers. Now.\u201d You commanded.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Ms. Stark?\u201d Friday asked.\u00a0\u201cI remember you saying, that we never give anyone any information we have.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve done this sooner.\u201d You admitted.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll need my suit and I\u2019ll be gone.

You smirked.</p><p>\u201cFriday, lets find out how well I wasted my time.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You flew directly to the guns, challenged everything that shot at you and destroyed everything that got in the way. Also, you had immediately ideas for better safety systems.</p><p>Cap came out, followed by Nat and Hulk ready to fight. You landed in front of them and put down your suit. It had also Nanotech.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d They asked.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Steve was confused.<br></p><p>You went over to Hulk and took gently his hand.\u00a0\u201cHey big guy.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cI need to talk to Bruce, if its alright with you.\u201d Hulk nodded and turned into Banner.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re confused and I\u2019m sorry for the way I treated all of you. You didn\u2019t deserved it and I probably can never make it up to you, but if we want to find them, we\u2019ve to work together.\u201d<br></p><p>Natasha took your hand.\u00a0\u201cFirst of all, come on in.\u201d</p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b> \u00a0~*~</b></b>\n\n<br></p><p>\u201cSo you say, you did this all on your own?

But I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d Steve asked. You noticed that he was very disappointed by you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMay was always the one who believed Peter would come back. As long as she had hope, I had it too. Now she wants a funeral.\u201d You sat down.\u00a0\u201cI know I left you alone and I know I probably don\u2019t deserve a second chance but I understand that what I did was wrong. I just didn\u2019t know how to move on and I was so angry at all of you because I thought you had already lost all hope.\u201d<br></p><p>Natasha seemed to be the only one who was not mad. She understood what you must\u2019ve been going through and she knew that everyone deserved a second chance. After all, you were just a kid. She pushed Steve gently.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Steve let out and wrapped his arms around you. You smiled and tried not to cry. You really had no idea how much you\u2019ve missed them.\u00a0\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave again.\u201d He said and didn\u2019t want to let go.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLady Stark, what was your idea?\u201d Thor asked as he came into the room and Cap let go of you.<br></p><p>\u201cTo copy the Infinity Stones, at least a few.\u201d You replied and they looked confused at you.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve Information about Visions Stone, the Mind Stone. A hell of a lot. T\u2019Challas sister did well. We also have information about Wanda\u2019s Powers and about the Tesseract, the space stone. With my Programm and our minds, we can definitely do it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou want to undo it by creating more of them?\u201d Steve was obviously not liking your idea.\u00a0\u201cWhat if they get in the wrong hands?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N is right, Steve. I tried everything and I always get to the point where we need a stone to fight Thanos.

You finished your education at home and had no interst in going to college.\u00a0</p><p>You felt like everybody gave up and you were so disappointed, that you stopped sharing your tech to find someone, and did everything on your own. You stopped sharing anything with anyone, neither the Avengers could reach you anymore.</p><p>Bruce tried a couple times to hack Friday but you weren\u2019t your dad. Your software stopped being easy to hack, a few months after they left. Steve was knocking on your door a couple times but you were an angry teenager which developed to an even more angry woman and Natasha, Natasha knew when to let go.</p><p>You wanted to be left alone until you finished what you started. Your own, Iron suit. All the training, the endless fights and bruises until you felt worthy enough to wear a suit like your fathers. <b><a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/fe/4c/18fe4ca926219c545f9832f7ab42324b.jpg\">(X)</a></b></p><p>\n\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b> \u00a0 ~*~</b></b>\n\n<br></p><p>You made everyone believe that you stopped caring about the world when the love of your life and your father vanished from it, but the truth was you had an eye on it everyday. You noticed that more crimes happened, that there wasn\u2019t enough police and the Avengers were overwhelmed by everything still.</p><p>You wanted to continue the legend your father began, to help people all around the world but to do it as good as him, you needed the time to build your suit as perfect as you could. You needed the time to be the best version of yourself.</p><p>You went over to May and wanted to show her you work but as you knocked, she stood in front of you with red eyes, May cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d You asked as you walked inside.<br></p><p>May didn\u2019t know how to tell you and sat down.\u00a0\u201cI want to have a funeral for Peter but I don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d She was stressed.\u00a0\u201cPrices for funerals tripled as half of the existence disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Your heart broke.

You were so deep into your work that the world moved on but you didn\u2019t. You were so focused on being as good or even better than your father, because you believed this would be the only chance on how to find them, that you missed being there for anyone else. You lost yourself and didn\u2019t noticed the world around you.</p><p>You walked into your lab. \u201cFriday, I need everything we found out the last four years and I need you to send it to the Avengers. Now.\u201d You commanded.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Ms. Stark?\u201d Friday asked.\u00a0\u201cI remember you saying, that we never give anyone any information we have.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve done this sooner.\u201d You admitted.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll need my suit and I\u2019ll be gone.

Also, you had immediately ideas for better safety systems.</p><p>Cap came out, followed by Nat and Hulk ready to fight. You landed in front of them and put down your suit. It had also Nanotech.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d They asked.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Steve was confused.<br></p><p>You went over to Hulk and took gently his hand.\u00a0\u201cHey big guy.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cI need to talk to Bruce, if its alright with you.\u201d Hulk nodded and turned into Banner.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re confused and I\u2019m sorry for the way I treated all of you.

But I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d Steve asked. You noticed that he was very disappointed by you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMay was always the one who believed Peter would come back. As long as she had hope, I had it too. Now she wants a funeral.\u201d You sat down.\u00a0\u201cI know I left you alone and I know I probably don\u2019t deserve a second chance but I understand that what I did was wrong. I just didn\u2019t know how to move on and I was so angry at all of you because I thought you had already lost all hope.\u201d<br></p><p>Natasha seemed to be the only one who was not mad. She understood what you must\u2019ve been going through and she knew that everyone deserved a second chance. After all, you were just a kid. She pushed Steve gently.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Steve let out and wrapped his arms around you. You smiled and tried not to cry. You really had no idea how much you\u2019ve missed them.\u00a0\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave again.\u201d He said and didn\u2019t want to let go.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLady Stark, what was your idea?\u201d Thor asked as he came into the room and Cap let go of you.<br></p><p>\u201cTo copy the Infinity Stones, at least a few.\u201d You replied and they looked confused at you.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve Information about Visions Stone, the Mind Stone. A hell of a lot. T\u2019Challas sister did well. We also have information about Wanda\u2019s Powers and about the Tesseract, the space stone. With my Programm and our minds, we can definitely do it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou want to undo it by creating more of them?\u201d Steve was obviously not liking your idea.\u00a0\u201cWhat if they get in the wrong hands?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N is right, Steve. I tried everything and I always get to the point where we need a stone to fight Thanos. I mean, Wanda had the powers of one Infinity Stone and could destroy another.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know this is risky but to be honest, there is nothing more to lose.\u201d You added.\u00a0\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve to trust me on this.\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone looked at Steve. You noticed that you convinced Bruce, Natasha and Thor. They also had no idea what to do, they tried everything they could. Your idea was the only hope they had left.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t find them?\u201d Rhodey joined the conversation.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s say we\u2019ve our own stones but can\u2019t bring them back?\u201d<br></p><p>Now their eyes were on you, but you had no answer for his question. You had the one hope, to find the people and destroy Thanos with your own stones but you never thought about what you\u2019d do, if you couldn\u2019t find them-</p><p>Steve came next to you and looked at the others. \u201c-Then we\u2019ll avenge them.\u201d<br></p><p>___________________</p><p>Hopefully you liked my Story.

All the training, the endless fights and bruises until you felt worthy enough to wear a suit like your fathers. <b><a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/fe/4c/18fe4ca926219c545f9832f7ab42324b.jpg\">(X)</a></b></p><p>\n\n<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b> &nbsp; ~*~</b></b>\n\n<br /></p><p>You made everyone believe that you stopped caring about the world when the love of your life and your father vanished from it, but the truth was you had an eye on it everyday. You noticed that more crimes happened, that there wasn&rsquo;t enough police and the Avengers were overwhelmed by everything still.</p><p>You wanted to continue the legend your father began, to help people all around the world but to do it as good as him, you needed the time to build your suit as perfect as you could. You needed the time to be the best version of yourself.</p><p>You went over to May and wanted to show her you work but as you knocked, she stood in front of you with red eyes, May cried.</p><p>&ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo; You asked as you walked inside.<br /></p><p>May didn&rsquo;t know how to tell you and sat down.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to have a funeral for Peter but I don&rsquo;t have enough money.&rdquo; She was stressed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Prices for funerals tripled as half of the existence disappeared.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart broke. A funeral. Now, where you built your suit she lost hope&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Please Y/N, I need this. I need to move on, it&rsquo;s been four years.&rdquo; She started crying again.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need to move on.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>It was like she was asking for your permission. You understood why she needed it, but it still hurt you. You nodded and wrapped her into your arms. It made you think.</p><p>\n\n<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b> &nbsp;~*~</b></b>\n\n<br /></p><p>After May fell asleep on the couch, you went home. Seeing her like this made you realize what you&rsquo;ve missed all those years. Your friends and the part of your family that was still left. You were so deep into your work that the world moved on but you didn&rsquo;t. You were so focused on being as good or even better than your father, because you believed this would be the only chance on how to find them, that you missed being there for anyone else. You lost yourself and didn&rsquo;t noticed the world around you.</p><p>You walked into your lab. &ldquo;Friday, I need everything we found out the last four years and I need you to send it to the Avengers. Now.&rdquo; You commanded.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Ms. Stark?&rdquo; Friday asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;I remember you saying, that we never give anyone any information we have.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We should&rsquo;ve done this sooner.&rdquo; You admitted.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need my suit and I&rsquo;ll be gone. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be back home so make sure that no one gets in here while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You put on your suit and flew to the Avengers Tower.</p><p>\n\n<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b> &nbsp;~*~</b></b>\n\n<br /></p><p>As soon as you were on the grounds of the Avengers Facility, the security system, designed by your father, aimed at you. You smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, lets find out how well I wasted my time.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You flew directly to the guns, challenged everything that shot at you and destroyed everything that got in the way. Also, you had immediately ideas for better safety systems.</p><p>Cap came out, followed by Nat and Hulk ready to fight. You landed in front of them and put down your suit. It had also Nanotech.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; They asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Steve was confused.<br /></p><p>You went over to Hulk and took gently his hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey big guy.&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need to talk to Bruce, if its alright with you.&rdquo; Hulk nodded and turned into Banner.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re confused and I&rsquo;m sorry for the way I treated all of you. You didn&rsquo;t deserved it and I probably can never make it up to you, but if we want to find them, we&rsquo;ve to work together.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Natasha took your hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;First of all, come on in.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b> &nbsp;~*~</b></b>\n\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you say, you did this all on your own? The suit and the research?&rdquo; Bruce asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is huge, Y/N!&rdquo; Bruce was amazed by all your work and all the information you&rsquo;ve got.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What is all of this?&rdquo; Steve questioned.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I tried developed many systems and programs, a lot failed, more than I like to admit but I think I&rsquo;ve something that could help us find them, or at least a way to undo the Snap. But I can&rsquo;t do it alone.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why now?&rdquo; Steve asked. You noticed that he was very disappointed by you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;May was always the one who believed Peter would come back. As long as she had hope, I had it too. Now she wants a funeral.&rdquo; You sat down.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know I left you alone and I know I probably don&rsquo;t deserve a second chance but I understand that what I did was wrong. I just didn&rsquo;t know how to move on and I was so angry at all of you because I thought you had already lost all hope.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Natasha seemed to be the only one who was not mad. She understood what you must&rsquo;ve been going through and she knew that everyone deserved a second chance. After all, you were just a kid. She pushed Steve gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Steve let out and wrapped his arms around you. You smiled and tried not to cry. You really had no idea how much you&rsquo;ve missed them.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t leave again.&rdquo; He said and didn&rsquo;t want to let go.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lady Stark, what was your idea?&rdquo; Thor asked as he came into the room and Cap let go of you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;To copy the Infinity Stones, at least a few.&rdquo; You replied and they looked confused at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve Information about Visions Stone, the Mind Stone. A hell of a lot. T&rsquo;Challas sister did well. We also have information about Wanda&rsquo;s Powers and about the Tesseract, the space stone. With my Programm and our minds, we can definitely do it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You want to undo it by creating more of them?&rdquo; Steve was obviously not liking your idea.&nbsp;&ldquo;What if they get in the wrong hands?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N is right, Steve. I tried everything and I always get to the point where we need a stone to fight Thanos. I mean, Wanda had the powers of one Infinity Stone and could destroy another.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know this is risky but to be honest, there is nothing more to lose.&rdquo; You added.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please, you&rsquo;ve to trust me on this.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Everyone looked at Steve. You noticed that you convinced Bruce, Natasha and Thor. They also had no idea what to do, they tried everything they could. Your idea was the only hope they had left.</p><p>&ldquo;What if we don&rsquo;t find them?&rdquo; Rhodey joined the conversation.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;ve our own stones but can&rsquo;t bring them back?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Now their eyes were on you, but you had no answer for his question. You had the one hope, to find the people and destroy Thanos with your own stones but you never thought about what you&rsquo;d do, if you couldn&rsquo;t find them-</p><p>Steve came next to you and looked at the others. &ldquo;-Then we&rsquo;ll avenge them.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>___________________</p><p>Hopefully you liked my Story.
