Or, well, flying, in his case. Well, it wasn&rsquo;t really like he did that to get here either since the most powerful EMP Tony had ever witnessed knocked them out of the air and straight onto the roof of the HYDRA base they were trying to take care of. When they hadn&rsquo;t hit a forcefield when entering the airspace, Rhodey had thought they got lucky. That was the last time he&rsquo;d ever assume luck was on his side when it came to beating up baddies.

Tony was clever like that, but also, Tony didn\u2019t have any military training, which meant that they were essentially at the same level of knowledge and problem-solving, a fact that seemed uncommon to the point where Rhodey had begun to wonder if people pretended Tony was the only smart guy just to play a joke on the rest of them. Not his fault, of course. It was Tony\u2019s brand to be referred to as resident genius. And where had his brand gotten them now? Stuck in HYDRA\u2019s basement, their suits taken, tied up to chairs as they faced towards a window so dark from their side that they wouldn\u2019t have known someone else was on the other side of it even if that person was licking the glass.</p><p>Just as the question of whether they were being watched entered Rhodey\u2019s mind, speakers at the uppermost corners of the dim, cement-based room crackled to life.</p><p>\u201cWe have new toys to play with!\u201d A sardonic voice came through the static as Rhodey resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Tony did it in his stead anyway.</p><p>\u201cBaron Von Strucker will be so pleased,\u201d the HYDRA goon crooned, their heavily accented voice echoing throughout the room as Rhodey began formulating an escape plan. One that Tony wouldn\u2019t follow, obviously, because he seemed to be fatally allergic to plans, even if only selectively.</p><p>\u201cYeah, by the way, where is Baldy? We wanted to have a talk with him,\u201d Tony replied snarkily, jutting his chin out as he remained very much stuck to his chair.</p><p>\u201cA talk about his indoctrination of civilians into dangerous experiments while pretending to be SHIELD.\u201d Rhodey added, tone raising challengingly even as the HYDRA agent on the other side of the glass simply laughed.</p><p>\u201cPretending, Colonel?\u201d They mused. \u201cWe were SHIELD. Just, the part of it that no one knew about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, I\u2019d still classify that as lying, right, Tony? Doesn\u2019t that sound like lying to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Tony replied without missing a beat. \u201cSo, where are our suits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn holding,\u201d the voice replied passively. \u201cThough I would be more worried about your pliable, human flesh than your disposable exo-skeleton, Mister Stark.

Alas, you never were a team player&hellip; Though they\u2019ll protect your memory from that.\u201d Rhodey subdued a smirk at the ongoing monologue as he lifted his head again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.

Tony was clever like that, but also, Tony didn\u2019t have any military training, which meant that they were essentially at the same level of knowledge and problem-solving, a fact that seemed uncommon to the point where Rhodey had begun to wonder if people pretended Tony was the only smart guy just to play a joke on the rest of them. Not his fault, of course. It was Tony\u2019s brand to be referred to as resident genius. And where had his brand gotten them now?
