Its quiet down there, the walls are thick and only Tony has Access to it which makes it the Perfect spot. He lays the boy down onto a matress and cuffs his hand to the stone wall, its a special Kind of material he wont be able to break out of that. </h2><h2>Tony then sits down outside of the huge Metall cage on a chair, feeling some tears behind his eyes again. For so long he was able to stop, he did good he helped people to get his so deeply needed Balance back, and here he is, having a full on relapse. For so long he was able to resist. To fight this dark urge inside of him and all it took was Peter asking in that weak voice of his if Tony is going to kill him to send him over that edge again. </h2><h2>So he lets a tear slip out, wiping it away just as quickly and leaning back, head against the wall and waiting for Peter to wake up. Meanwhile he pulls out a small list of his rules that Peter is going to need if he wants to survive this, because this time Tony isnt going to have fun and then kill him.</h2><h2>Hes going to try to convert the boy, to bring him onto his dark path to Twist and turn him, someone needs to carry on Tonys legacy afterall. </h2><h2>Its going to be a Lot of work tho he already knows it.  </h2><h2>Just After that Peter jumps awake, standing up and turning to look at Tony. &ldquo;What did you do? Why&hellip;why did you..ouch&rdquo; Peter frowns, moving his other hand to gently stroke over the bump on his head. Thats when he remembers what he read what he found out about Tony, and it sends a dark shiver down his spine when he looks around. </h2><h2>His expression changing .</h2><div class=\"npf_row\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3fec0fd68ab5a7fc23337fedda517b53/tumblr_pt40ztpt6J1tjrvbp_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ae2bd8768c8d74850ccd97a940790a8/tumblr_pt40zuvKkJ1tjrvbp_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure></div><h2>&ldquo;I&hellip; I thought you liked me Mr. Stark i thought we were something like friends. Please don&rsquo;t do this we can talk about everything you know i listen!

Nevermind.&rdquo; Peter says. </h2><h2>When Tony sees that boys eyes tearing up he feels that guilt in his chest again, staring back at him. The last sentence spiked his interest. &ldquo;You thought what ? Come on, Peter just spit it out i have work to do and all that i can&rsquo;t sit around here and Listen to..-&rdquo; thats when hes being cut off by Peter . </h2><h2>&ldquo;I thought&hellip;I really thought you were crushing on me too&hellip;&rdquo; he frowns deeply. Despite their situation and all, but this hurt him deeply.

Tony and Pepper had taken Morgan there once, but she was too little to remember it.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, does everyone have their bags?&rdquo; Tony said.</p><p>They all shook their heads yes. Peter had a Spiderman backpack he saw at Target, Harley had a red and black bag, Nebula had a silky blue bag, Vision had a normal backpack, and Tony held Morgans Iron Man backpack with a Hello Kitty key chain.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. Does everyone have sunscreen, money for food and stuff, and their phones, because we are not turning around.&rdquo; Tony asked.</p><p>They all checked and said yes.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s load up!&rdquo; Tony motioned his hand towards the door. Peter and Harley took off running, while Nebula and Vision just walked. Tony said bye to Pepper and gave her a kiss, and Morgan hugged her. Morgan then went to run with Peter and Harley but Tony picked her up and carried her piggy-back style.</p><p>They all arrived at the car. Vision was in the front with Tony and helped navigate, Nebula and Morgan were in the next row, and Peter and Harley sat in the back.</p><p>The car was a war zone.</p><p>Peter dropped his phone and it slid up and infront of Nebula. Nebula had air pods from Tony on, and couldn&rsquo;t hear Peter, and Morgan fell asleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no. She can&rsquo;t hear us. She has air pods!&rdquo; Harley joked, witch did not amuse Peter. </p><p>Peter webbed his mouth shut. He went to get unbuckled but Tony threatened to take away his suit if he did. Peter then asked Vision to get his phone, but he was too busy with helping Tony with directions. </p><p>Finally after about five minutes of bugging him, Vision unbuckled, got his phone and gave it to Peter. Meanwhile Tony took a wrong turn and was yelling at Vision, who blamed Peter. Harley got the webbing off with one of Nebula&rsquo;s knives he found on the floor and was yelling at Peter. Morgan woke up and was grumpy, while Nebula still heard nothing.</p><p>About an hour later they arrived at the airport. Rhodey would come later and pick up Tony&rsquo;s car. </p><p>After a long wait they boarded their plane. Harley was a little scared, so Tony sat beside him. Vision sat behind Tony with Morgan, and Peter and Nebula were infront of Tony and Harley.</p><p>The flight was much better than the car.

He winced at his landing due to the scar on his back. Peter had a shard of glass in his knee from front flipping out of the expensive pane. He webbed across the scenery for what seemed like ages till he was in a alley somewhere close to the city.</p><p>He slid down the bricks at his back, with his senses screaming. He ignored them.</p><p>God, he wished he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He felt a needle enter his neck, delving deep into his skin, paralyzing him.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Parker. Is the spider sense not working, Bitch? Trust me, I\u2019ve studied you, I know who you are, we have a plan for you and you just ran right into the trap.\u201d Peter tried to move, but he couldn\u2019t there was blood trickling down his neck as he was slipping away from consciousness. </p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPETER!\u201d Tony cried out of the broken pane, trying not to step on the sharp edges of the debris from the glass. \u201cI\u2019m getting the team.\u201d Steve said bluntly, exiting the room. Tony grabbed the super soldier\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNo, he\u2019s my kid.\u201d He stared into his eyes with rage at Steve\u2019s previous comment. \u201cMy kid, my rescue.\u201d He tapped the Arc Reactor and suited up. \u201cTony-\u201c Steve ran towards the man about to fly out of the same hole Peter made in the window. \u201cI\u2019m Motherfucking sure bitch.\u201d He snapped at Steve, jumping out following Peter\u2019s past actions.</p><p>After about 20 miles of flight it started to rain, he ducked into the alley he was closest to out of reflex, he knew his suit would work in the rain but he ducked into the alley anyways. A person in a set of jeans and a science pun shirt was sat further down in the alley.  \u201cPete?\u201d Tony ran towards the person. \u201cOh my god Peter!\u201d He got on one knee next to the teen. \u201cPeter?\u201d </p><p>The genius grabbed the jaw of the teen, he was horrified at the pail tone on Peter\u2019s face. He felt the blood from the teen\u2019s neck, trying to check for a pulse. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t feel one.</p><p>\u201cPeter. I swear to god. If you\u2019re dead-\u201c A person walked behind the billionaire and grabbed him. He grabbed a new ingection and shoved it into Tony\u2019s neck. The man then covered Tony\u2019s face and blocked all sources of air, causing him to pass out. The man saw the corpse and smiled. \u201cJust like I planned it.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes fluttered open to being tied and handcuffed to a chair in a dark room with stone walls and a mirror that stretched across the wall. He looked at men standing before him with electrical paddles. They left the room to a confused Peter with trickling down his face. He panicked, trying to recall the last moments he experienced. The thing that upset him the most was the only thing he recalled was he had told the man to fuck off. </p><p>Tony woke to his hands chained above him but still tied to a chair. A dark room with 3 stone walls and a  glass pane he could see out of. Was that Peter? \u201cPete?\u201d Tony asked softly remembering the stilled pulse, but somehow Peter was alive and sobbing.  Then he heard Peter\u2019s voice cry out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Peter hung his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please, just tell me what I did.\u201d He continued to sob quietly. As Tony shook his head sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fucking fault Peter.\u201d As if it was on cue, the door flew open and a man walked through with a smirk. \u201cWorried about what you did, bitch? Don\u2019t be for long. It\u2019s gonna be me you\u2019re worried about.\u201d He grabbed a knife out of his pocket. \u201cNow, where to start? How about, riiiiiight here.\u201d He drew out his words, cutting Pet cheek. Tony looked down wanting to say something but they couldn\u2019t hear him, instead, the man looked him straight in the eyes, and smiled. Peter continued to cry, having the tears flow into his blood. His cheek was sliced open and gushing. \u201cNot so much of a pretty face now, huh?\u201d Peter winced as the man dug deeper into his cheek. The blood now was flowing into Peter\u2019s mouth as he screamed. The chill Tony got from this scream was terrifying. \u201cGET YOUR HANDS OFF PETER!\u201d Tony screamed. But Peter couldn\u2019t hear him, the mirror blocked noise. </p><p>He didn\u2019t want to feel more pain, he didn\u2019t want to feel it. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t feel anything but pain. He didn\u2019t realize the man had stopped, and that there was blood on the floor, his blood, he only realized the man had cut in his cheek, but there were two wounds, adding a gushing shoulder as well. </p><p>After the man stopped both of the people in captivity calmed down and found a way to make it comfortable enough for them to sleep.</p><p>When Peter started to scream, he woke Tony. He saw what was happening, he was being cut again. But this time It was across his stomach. \u201cKid!\u201d Tony cried out, not able to do anything. But the man cutting knew somehow that he was crying out, and spoke. \u201cWant me to stop, Stark?\u201d This confused Peter, was Tony here too? Peter screamed louder at the feeling of the man cutting deeper. Tony looked up and tried to cover his ears with his arms, but it didn\u2019t work when Peter got another cut underneath the one already recently put on his stomach by the blade making him scream louder than before. Tony had to look at the floor it was all he could do without looking at Peter, but all he saw was Peter\u2019s blood everywhere. The man left Peter alone after being satisfied with his work. \u201cMr. Stark? Unless he.. lied to me, you\u2019re here. I don\u2019t know if you can hear me, or even see me. I just wanna say&hellip; I\u2019m bleeding a lot, and I don\u2019t know how much more blood I can lose.\u201d Peter got choked up, \u201cplease don\u2019t let me die..\u201d Tony was startled at the fact he would say that. Especially because he was always positive about horrid situations. He continued to cry till he dozed off, leaving Tony the only one awake. He decided to follow Peter to sleep, since, it was the only thing to do. </p><p>The next time Peter woke up he was faced to a man he recognized. \u201cMr. Stark?\u201d This woke Tony. He looked straight up. \u201cKid?\u201d There was no blood on the floor anymore, so the two both assumed they were somewhere different. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Peter asked. \u201cNo clue. But I know one thing. YOU JUMPED OUT A WINDOW! WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL?!\u201d Peter laughed at Tony freaking out, but that hurt the cuts on his stomach. Suddenly Peter remembered why. The pain flew back to him and he choked on it. Tony saw the face that Peter had made and instantly realized what he had asked had been a touchy question. \u201cAdrenaline&hellip; I-it got the best out of me. I\u2019m s-sorry.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d The room went silent for a bit, With both of the boys deep in thought. Until the man came in again, Peter quaked at the knife now at his neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, little bitch, Scared?\u201d His mouth was now covered by the man&rsquo;s hand, blocking him from panicking. \u201cWhat do I have to give you to stop?!\u201d The man snickered. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand, Stark. What I want is him. Dead.\u201d Tony gulped at the idea of someone wanting a fifteen-year-old dead. \u201dWhat the hell did he do to you?! He&rsquo;s innocent!\u201d He screamed at the man. The figure did nothing, he just smiled. He pulled the knife across the teen\u2019s skin. \u201dI won&rsquo;t kill him yet, but I will.\u201d Peter could still breathe, the man didn&rsquo;t cut that deep. \u201dActually, I&rsquo;m not done yet.\u201d He said to the tied-up men. He looked down the teen\u2019s back and lifted him up. \u201dPerfect.\u201d He cut right beside the scab and decided to open the previous cut on Peter\u2019s back. Peter yelped under his covered mouth. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but look at the ground that was clean, now covered with Peter\u2019s blood. Peter somehow broke free from the man&rsquo;s grip.</p><p>\u201dStop. Just kill me already.\u201d</p>",

He didn\u2019t realize the man had stopped, and that there was blood on the floor, his blood, he only realized the man had cut in his cheek, but there were two wounds, adding a gushing shoulder as well. </p><p>After the man stopped both of the people in captivity calmed down and found a way to make it comfortable enough for them to sleep.</p><p>When Peter started to scream, he woke Tony. He saw what was happening, he was being cut again. But this time It was across his stomach. \u201cKid!\u201d Tony cried out, not able to do anything. But the man cutting knew somehow that he was crying out, and spoke. \u201cWant me to stop, Stark?\u201d This confused Peter, was Tony here too? Peter screamed louder at the feeling of the man cutting deeper. Tony looked up and tried to cover his ears with his arms, but it didn\u2019t work when Peter got another cut underneath the one already recently put on his stomach by the blade making him scream louder than before. Tony had to look at the floor it was all he could do without looking at Peter, but all he saw was Peter\u2019s blood everywhere. The man left Peter alone after being satisfied with his work. \u201cMr. Stark? Unless he.. lied to me, you\u2019re here. I don\u2019t know if you can hear me, or even see me. I just wanna say\u2026 I\u2019m bleeding a lot, and I don\u2019t know how much more blood I can lose.\u201d Peter got choked up, \u201cplease don\u2019t let me die..\u201d Tony was startled at the fact he would say that. Especially because he was always positive about horrid situations. He continued to cry till he dozed off, leaving Tony the only one awake. He decided to follow Peter to sleep, since, it was the only thing to do. </p><p>The next time Peter woke up he was faced to a man he recognized. \u201cMr. Stark?\u201d This woke Tony. He looked straight up. \u201cKid?\u201d There was no blood on the floor anymore, so the two both assumed they were somewhere different. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Peter asked. \u201cNo clue. But I know one thing. YOU JUMPED OUT A WINDOW! WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL?!\u201d Peter laughed at Tony freaking out, but that hurt the cuts on his stomach. Suddenly Peter remembered why. The pain flew back to him and he choked on it. Tony saw the face that Peter had made and instantly realized what he had asked had been a touchy question. \u201cAdrenaline\u2026 I-it got the best out of me. I\u2019m s-sorry.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d The room went silent for a bit, With both of the boys deep in thought. Until the man came in again, Peter quaked at the knife now at his neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, little bitch, Scared?\u201d His mouth was now covered by the man\u2019s hand, blocking him from panicking. \u201cWhat do I have to give you to stop?!\u201d The man snickered. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand, Stark. What I want is him. Dead.\u201d Tony gulped at the idea of someone wanting a fifteen-year-old dead. \u201dWhat the hell did he do to you?! He\u2019s innocent!\u201d He screamed at the man. The figure did nothing, he just smiled. He pulled the knife across the teen\u2019s skin. \u201dI won\u2019t kill him yet, but I will.\u201d Peter could still breathe, the man didn\u2019t cut that deep. \u201dActually, I\u2019m not done yet.\u201d He said to the tied-up men. He looked down the teen\u2019s back and lifted him up. \u201dPerfect.\u201d He cut right beside the scab and decided to open the previous cut on Peter\u2019s back. Peter yelped under his covered mouth. Tony couldn\u2019t help but look at the ground that was clean, now covered with Peter\u2019s blood. Peter somehow broke free from the man\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201dStop. Just kill me already.\u201d</p>",

He winced at his landing due to the scar on his back. Peter had a shard of glass in his knee from front flipping out of the expensive pane. He webbed across the scenery for what seemed like ages till he was in a alley somewhere close to the city.</p><p>He slid down the bricks at his back, with his senses screaming. He ignored them.</p><p>God, he wished he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>He felt a needle enter his neck, delving deep into his skin, paralyzing him.</p><p>&ldquo;Jeez, Parker. Is the spider sense not working, Bitch? Trust me, I&rsquo;ve studied you, I know who you are, we have a plan for you and you just ran right into the trap.&rdquo; Peter tried to move, but he couldn&rsquo;t there was blood trickling down his neck as he was slipping away from consciousness. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;PETER!&rdquo; Tony cried out of the broken pane, trying not to step on the sharp edges of the debris from the glass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting the team.&rdquo; Steve said bluntly, exiting the room. Tony grabbed the super soldier&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s my kid.&rdquo; He stared into his eyes with rage at Steve&rsquo;s previous comment. &ldquo;My kid, my rescue.&rdquo; He tapped the Arc Reactor and suited up. &ldquo;Tony-&ldquo; Steve ran towards the man about to fly out of the same hole Peter made in the window. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Motherfucking sure bitch.&rdquo; He snapped at Steve, jumping out following Peter&rsquo;s past actions.</p><p>After about 20 miles of flight it started to rain, he ducked into the alley he was closest to out of reflex, he knew his suit would work in the rain but he ducked into the alley anyways. A person in a set of jeans and a science pun shirt was sat further down in the alley.  &ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; Tony ran towards the person. &ldquo;Oh my god Peter!&rdquo; He got on one knee next to the teen. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; </p><p>The genius grabbed the jaw of the teen, he was horrified at the pail tone on Peter&rsquo;s face. He felt the blood from the teen&rsquo;s neck, trying to check for a pulse. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t feel one.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter. I swear to god. If you&rsquo;re dead-&ldquo; A person walked behind the billionaire and grabbed him. He grabbed a new ingection and shoved it into Tony&rsquo;s neck. The man then covered Tony&rsquo;s face and blocked all sources of air, causing him to pass out. The man saw the corpse and smiled. &ldquo;Just like I planned it.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes fluttered open to being tied and handcuffed to a chair in a dark room with stone walls and a mirror that stretched across the wall. He looked at men standing before him with electrical paddles. They left the room to a confused Peter with trickling down his face. He panicked, trying to recall the last moments he experienced. The thing that upset him the most was the only thing he recalled was he had told the man to fuck off. </p><p>Tony woke to his hands chained above him but still tied to a chair. A dark room with 3 stone walls and a  glass pane he could see out of. Was that Peter? &ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; Tony asked softly remembering the stilled pulse, but somehow Peter was alive and sobbing.  Then he heard Peter&rsquo;s voice cry out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Peter hung his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, please, just tell me what I did.&rdquo; He continued to sob quietly. As Tony shook his head sadly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fucking fault Peter.&rdquo; As if it was on cue, the door flew open and a man walked through with a smirk. &ldquo;Worried about what you did, bitch? Don&rsquo;t be for long. It&rsquo;s gonna be me you&rsquo;re worried about.&rdquo; He grabbed a knife out of his pocket. &ldquo;Now, where to start? How about, riiiiiight here.&rdquo; He drew out his words, cutting Pet cheek. Tony looked down wanting to say something but they couldn&rsquo;t hear him, instead, the man looked him straight in the eyes, and smiled. Peter continued to cry, having the tears flow into his blood. His cheek was sliced open and gushing. &ldquo;Not so much of a pretty face now, huh?&rdquo; Peter winced as the man dug deeper into his cheek. The blood now was flowing into Peter&rsquo;s mouth as he screamed. The chill Tony got from this scream was terrifying. &ldquo;GET YOUR HANDS OFF PETER!&rdquo; Tony screamed. But Peter couldn&rsquo;t hear him, the mirror blocked noise. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t want to feel more pain, he didn&rsquo;t want to feel it. </p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t feel anything but pain.
