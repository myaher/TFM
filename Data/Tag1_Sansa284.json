It might be that she was never especially interested, perhaps a tomboy from birth. Even if that <i>was</i> the case, I am sure you could find ways to make the skills feel relevant to her - because you really only have two pupils, so you could have one-to-one sessions! Arya says she doesn\u2019t want to be a lady? Alright, but who\u2019s going to fix holes in her clothes for her then - she can learn more practical needlework! Or have her do works she\u2019s more invested in - perhaps a blanket for Nymeria (after all, Nymeria won\u2019t care if it\u2019s not perfect, and practise makes perfect)? <br/></p><p>And honestly, I\u2019m not convinced that Arya was like this from birth - I think she\u2019s lost interest because she\u2019s been made to believe that she will never be good at these things (in comparison to Sansa). As she muses in her first chapter:</p><p><i>It wasn\u2019t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left.

She played the high harp</i> and <i>the bells.</i></p><p>Arya\u2019s not dismissing these things; it hurts her that she <i>can\u2019t</i> do them as well as Sansa. And maybe Sansa has natural talent that Arya has observed and envies, but that\u2019s not everything. A caring teacher (who only really has two pupils!) can sit down with her, observe her at her work and see what she\u2019s doing wrong or offer helpful pointers! And feed her interest as above! She\u2019s not so bothered about pretty floral patterns? Do a pattern of direwolves and swords! <i>Not everyone is Sansa!</i> Has Septa Mordane even noticed that Arya\u2019s left-handed? Is that why she struggles so much with some things?</p><p>Really, the girl needs her confidence boosted. I expect she may come off as confident because of how she bucks the normal rules, but from in her head we can see how much she\u2019s really struggling with her self-esteem and position in society.</p><p>And I imagine Septa Mordane probably feels under pressure - here she is, employed by one of the highest lords of the land to make their daughters into ladies, and she\u2019s only managing 50%! Maybe she feels like she can\u2019t veer outside of the standard lessons and methods in case the parents disapprove, but she\u2019s told Catelyn about Arya\u2019s difficulties, I\u2019m sure if she had ideas to help or fix the situation Cat and Ned could be open-minded (after all, Ned hires Syrio in OTL). They love their daughter, and they believe her getting those skills will be for her overall benefit.</p><p><br/></p><p>I just&hellip; don\u2019t understand how somebody tasked with educating <i>two</i> children (I know it seems like Jeyne Poole and Beth Cassel join in at times, but I doubt they\u2019re a real focus in comparison) can be critically failing one of the two children this ridiculously badly. Like, I\u2019m open to Septa Mordane defenses, but my only conclusion is that she is basically a <i>terrible</i> teacher who is only any good when she is handed pupils with natural aptitude at what she\u2019s meant to be teaching.</p><p>At least TV!Septa Mordane gets that moment of defending Sansa, and I maybe wouldn\u2019t put that past her in the books if the occasion arose, but there\u2019s just&hellip; so little that really redeems her in the books.

She spent her most of her time training to be a Lady - attending sewing/embroidery lessons &amp; such. That resulted her not to play with dolls for years..

But tell me, what would you do if you were the only Stark left in KL? Ned was imprisoned while Arya was taken away for safety purposes. Ned&rsquo;s execution was not entirely her fault, you see. Yes, she wrote to Robb to bend the knee to Joffrey, BUT Sansa - in a way - did it because she was (mentally) forced to (by Cersei) &amp; out of fear. I guess people who are hating on Sansa failed to see that Joffrey was a bully &amp; was often not true to his words.
