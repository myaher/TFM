Please, do tell.    </blockquote><p>K, so&hellip; there\u2019s an offhand reference somewhere to\u00a0\u201cThe Sacred 28\u2033- a list of 28 pureblood families that are the <i>only </i>ones that are still 100% Pureblood &trade; with no Muggle anywhere in their family trees.\u00a0</p><p>The Weasleys are on that list.</p><p>like a lot of JKR\u2019s offhand references this makes absolutely no sense as soon as you start to engage with it. like, this implies that either there has been a long line of Weasleys that are only children who just happened to only ever marry other purebloods- which is pretty unlikely on the face of it and also pretty Not Normal for wizards by canon-era- or that the Weasleys\u2019 family character is a pretty recent development. it also implies that at some point the Weasleys were important enough that the people who give a damn about lists like these paid attention to them and their ancestry, instead of writing them off as Not Our Sort.\u00a0</p><p>so my headcanon is that up until fairly recently by wizarding standards, the Weasleys <i>were </i>a Snobby Unpleasant Rich Pureblood Family, though slightly less unpleasant than the Malfoys (like that\u2019s hard). they really did care about their ~bloodline~ and their ~geneology~ and shit.\u00a0</p><p>enter arthur weasley\u2019s great-great-grandfather, give or take a few greats, round about 1630 or so.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>arthur weasley\u2019s great-great-grandfather, like many weasleys, possessed more enthusiasm than sense. arthur weasley\u2019s great-great-grandfather hears about these rare new flowers from Holland that have potent magical properties (and incidentally are worth an awful lot of money).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cgosh,\u201d he thinks,\u00a0\u201cthis whole\u00a0\u2018tulip\u2019 thing sounds like a great investment! what could possibly go wrong?\u201d<br/></p><p><b>[narrator voice] </b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania\">it was not a good investment.\u00a0</a></p><p>the Weasley Family Fortune prettttttty much disappeared that year. though on the plus side they did now have a very colourful garden.\u00a0</p><p>for a couple generations the various Weasley ancestors attempted to get The Family Fortune (and the implied social status that came with it) back, buuuut no dice. they basically wound up at the lower end of wizarding social strata- better off than, say, the Gaunts, but in general at the same end of the scale that like, a family with mixed wizard/muggle heritage was\u00a0\u201csupposed\u201d to be at. and like, the\u00a0\u201cacceptable\u201d responses to that loss of fortune were either\u00a0\u201cclaw back your social position by backstabbing and stealing what you\u00a0\u2018deserve\u2019\u201d or\u00a0\u201caccept that these Snobby Unpleasant Rich Purebloods are just your betters and be grateful they\u2019re treating you this well.\u201d the Weasleys kinda pingponged back and forth\u00a0 between different variants of these extremes for a few centuries, telling every generation of little Weasleys that they\u2019re <i>purebloods </i>dammit they should <i>act </i>like it&hellip;</p><p><i>enter Arthur Weasley and Molly Prewett, </i>who said\u00a0\u2018fuck no, we are not raising our children like this\u2019 and deliberately set out to keep their kids away from growing up with that mindset.

        "body": "<p>Hullo sweethearts,</p><p>as many of you know it already, many muggle-borns have been frustrated at the impossibility of using muggle devices at Hogwarts in the past few years, which has caused a real revolution in the wizarding world. The frustration has been of many kinds. Some were <i>really</i> frustrated at not being able to send snaps of their pumpkin juices at breakfast to their thousands (or \u201cdozens\u201d) of followers. Many muggle-borns have indeed accused the school of being responsible of them loosing internet fame and therefore causing them emotional distress. Other students have approached the issue on a more scholarly level, one that the school board could understand. It is certainly true that Internet can be useful for academic purposes, and that it can save time, especially when doing a research. Anyway, the ministry have heard the cries of these students, and also the cries of other wizards who had heard of the benefits (and some other non-beneficial stuff) of the use of Internet from their fellow muggle-born classmates. The ministry have studied the question, and in 2011 the Wiz-fi was born.</p><p>For example, have you guys heard of <a href=\"http://www.hogwartslibrary.sch.uk\" target=\"_blank\">www.hogwartslibrary.sch.uk</a> ? This website is so useful; everything at Hogwarts&rsquo; library is now on this website. Just go take a look and you will see what I mean. There is even an option at the bottom left where you can request an owl to deliver the book to you, no matter where you are in the world. One feature I really like to use, and I use it very often when I am in public transports, is that you can click on the tiny wand icon under each book, and the magical autonomous wand that has been set at Hogwarts, &ndash; a similar magic to the one that had been used for the sorting hat centuries ago has been used for this wand &ndash;, knows in just a few seconds that you have made a request, and it goes to the book and taps it (even if the book is currently in someone\u2019s dorm and not in the library &ndash; which has caused not-so hilarious situations in which students tried to catch the wand to lock it in their bedside table). When the wand taps the book, it creates a connection between you and the book. It is not much different than a telephone, only it is one-sided. So, the content of the book arrives to you, and you can hear the book directly from the author. Confused? Do not be. Just like a painting of someone can speak to you, the book of an author can speak to you about itself from the author\u2019s viewpoint, because it contains the consciousness of that person as it existed during the moment the book was written. Sometimes, you will even hear the author saying something that is clearly not in the book, like him or her shouting bad words because his or her back pocket set on fire as he or she forgot to put his or her wand on his or her desk before sitting to write his or her book. So it is really fantastic, and a nice immersion. For the moment, it is still one-sided, unlike a painting, so you can\u2019t actually talk and expect a reply, but the ministry are working on a way to change that. They would like to make the project similar to the way paintings work. It would then be possible to access the author\u2019s mind, and to ask him or her what he or she was truly thinking about a subject he or she wrote about, etc. The ministry have succeeded a few months ago one of their experiments, but only on the original book of an author, not on copies of that book, and it is to note that it worked only because the author of said-book is still alive, and participated and agreed to the experiment. Just like paintings are usually made when the wizard is alive, not when he\u2019s dead. Hearing the author shouting bad words because of his or her left buttock catching fire is still possible, for the reason that this happened through the consciousness of the author at a specific moment during the writing, while the author certainly did not have you and your question in his or her consciousness with a ready answer while writing. Maybe he or she imagined someone would ask your question and imagined an answer, but what is to remember from the magic used here is that what is caught by it is what the author expressed. So the bad words can be heard because the author expressed them outwardly, just like the book is an outward expression of his or her mind. The rest remains private, at least when in comes to today\u2019s wiztech.\u00a0</p><p>In the title of this article, I mentioned wi-fi and wiz-fi. There is a difference to make, and it can be understood more easily with the example of hogwartslibrary.sch.uk. You are now familiar with the audio option, but what you might not know if you have never used it before is that you do not actually need earplugs or any other speakers for that matter. You just need to be a wizard, because your own magic is at the other end, it is the receiver. Briefly, the Wiz-fi (wiz for wizard) knows who is using it. If you are using muggle wi-fi it is still ok. You would think that it could not recognize you because it is muggle, which is true, but the fact is some websites like hogwartslibrary.sch.uk are on a stable Wiz-fi line, such as Hogwarts&rsquo; Wiz-fi, and what is special about that Wiz-fi is that it repels muggles (not physically, but it does not recognize muggle people or things as receivers, so it would even repel muggle wi-fi in some way, not destroy it but rather overtake it. So if you are muggle, the Wiz-fi will not be able to find you, so the page you are trying to open will not appear. But, if you are a wizard, the Wiz-fi will repel everything muggle and will realize that you are there, so it will connect. If you are in Hogwarts, you can still connect to muggle websites, because the Wiz-fi can read the Wi-fi, and modify it and still be readable, just like you can turn a mp4 to an avi format. The repel is solely on finding the receiver, not on the actual line.</p><p>The Wiz-fi still has some problems though, and one of them is that in some cities muggles and wizards live together, so sometimes the Wiz-fi will work on a muggle computer even if it is currently used by a muggle, because a wizard is in proximity. It is a matter of some meters, and sometimes it also depends on your sound volume on your device. Especially when it comes to audio stuff, the whole point is to be able to listen to it, right? So to be in hearing distance, etc. It rarely happens, but some wizards still end up in weird situations, like starting to hear stuff in their head that they can\u2019t control, and it only stops if they leave the place they are currently at, etc. And we can understand why these wizards who have experienced this have been annoyed, so, yes, it is clearly an issue. But as just said, it rarely happens, mostly because muggles usually do not know any wizarding websites, for obvious reasons.</p><p>In the past, there used to be another issue that thankfully has been resolved, and it concerned privacy. A wizard only needed to be closer to the device than the person who was actually using it, to hear what the person was listening to, and also in that case the person who wanted to hear had his connection cut and could not hear anymore until the other person left. But as said, this issue has been resolved in a very great way. Now, it is possible to choose how many people will be using the Wiz-fi, so you can enter one person and this way the connection will not switch to someone else, because it will realize the receiver is different (however it will stop entirely until you decide to start it back again, which can indeed be annoying too), or you can accept multiple receivers and then make group sessions, which was not possible before.\u00a0</p><p>Back to the issue on muggles ending up being on the Wiz-fi, which mostly concerns websites and features that do not use this audio thingy (though it could still be playable through speakers on muggle devices), if the wizard leaves and the muggle is still using Wiz-fi, then the Wiz-fi will realize it and will start opening several tabs and windows will pop up saying stuff like: \u201cthere&rsquo;s a virus on your computer\u201d or more often \u201cdid you really believe wizards exist. ah ah. you just a muggle&rsquo;&rsquo;, and sometimes websites like the ones affiliated to Hogwarts feel like joking, and ask the muggle, for example, if they would rather be in hufflepuff or in slytherin, or if they believe Nick should have the right to enter the <i>My-head-was-entirely-cut-off-my-body bowling group</i>, and the muggle just ends up super confused, leaves Wiz-fi to search these groups on google, and do not find anything, and therefore abandon.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Another big issue with Wiz-fi has been that the wizard or witch\u2019s magic is the whole reason why it is working. It can\u2019t operate without magic, and this is really a big issue when it comes to squibs. Thankfully, the great Hermione Granger is working on their rights, and the ministry are working on a concept.\u00a0</p><p>As you already know, squibs, since they are from a wizarding family, are registered at the ministry, unlike regular muggles (who could end up having muggle-born children, meaning they are technically squibs of many generations who have not been registered). So, squibs have the right to enter the wizarding world, they know about the ministry, they can shop at wizarding stores, etc. So back to the subject, the ministry are working on a concept, and they hope it will be realized by 2021. They want to create some sort of device that would only be available after a formal request of the squib. A muggle could not fill this form, first because they do not know about the ministry, even less where it is, nor do they know about the wiz-fi, and because the ministry would know they are not part of the community since they are unregistered. So squibs, since they are registered, are protected and will be made aware of all the steps to take in order to have the right to access the wiz-fi legally. Once he or she will make the request for the wiz-fi device, the squib will then have a mark on him or herself from now on to make sure that the device is used only by the squib. The device would act basically like a data plan. It would contain enough magic in order to use the Wiz-fi. Autonomous magic, just like the sorting hat once again, or even the room of requirements, that is, by the way, still slowly healing itself and should be back on track in a few years, since it had been protected with a very powerful repairing charm (its creator was truly brilliant and very much talented). The wiz-fi device for squibs would only need a wizard to create it, to store the necessary magic once, and it would keep on going without any conscious help afterwards. This stored magic could only be used for what it has been created, that is to say the Wiz-fi.\u00a0</p><p>Now you may be thinking&hellip; But what about the law on the secrecy? What about Hogwarts\u2019 secrets? The first question has already been answered if you paid attention. As for the other possibility, a wizard showing a website to a non-muggle, this can\u2019t be known yet, but the ministry trust the wizarding community to respect the law, just as they expect witches and wizards to respect it for all matters in general, that likewise can\u2019t be known (such as talking to a muggle about the existence of dragons, for instance). As for the second, this is a matter that concerns the school alone and has already been resolved very quickly. Yes, students can now send snaps of their pumpkin juice. However, only someone who has been to Hogwarts can actually see the background clearly, if it shows or reveals too much of Hogwarts. It would have been too difficult to work this magic on the Wiz-fi line, so as Hogwarts is a special case, the grounds have been through a Wiz-fi-photo-and-video-captures repeller for non-students-and-alumni, meaning Hogwarts will appear differently to those who do not know Hogwarts, just like the actual castle would appear differently to a muggle if he or she were to be standing next to its grounds. The background remains neutral, and stuff that would not reveal anything such as some stones or grass and trees outside would not be enough for the repel charm to be in action, so people can still make beautiful snaps in their actual contexts, when they are not revealing of Hogwarts\u2019 secrets. And obviously it is impossible to use the localization feature, since Hogwarts does not figure on the Wizmap and only the Wiz-fi is usable on its grounds (and not the wi-fi, which on the other hand <i>could</i> localize the place, as it considers the position on the planet and not only already known places). Because of this localization issue only related to specific places like Hogwarts and some special offices of the ministry, the ministry do not have access either to the use that is being made by the students at Hogwarts. Some students, thinking this meant their research history would remain entirely private, have had the surprise of getting a detention from the headmistress. *Slow claps*. It is also forbidden to be used during classes, unless specfied otherwise by the teachers (which does not happen very often).</p><p>And that is it! I now invite you to visit some wizarding websites. Some very interesting links can be found on hogwartslibrary.sch.uk while simply using the website search bar feature at the top right of the page. Their algorithm to find the best sources is really on top. I also highly suggest you to download the \u2018Wizfi-o Patronum\u2019 as well which is excellent at protecting yourself from dark wizards online. You can also download the Charmify app, which surprisingly is not a dating site, but the equivalent of Spotify for muggles, to discover all the newest sounds. Now you\u2019re ready to explore the web (Ron Weasley is traumatized), so have fun and, if you are currently a student at Hogwarts, do NOT make McGonagall angry. That woman is watching you.</p>",

It is also forbidden to be used during classes, unless specfied otherwise by the teachers (which does not happen very often).</p><p>And that is it! I now invite you to visit some wizarding websites. Some very interesting links can be found on hogwartslibrary.sch.uk while simply using the website search bar feature at the top right of the page. Their algorithm to find the best sources is really on top. I also highly suggest you to download the \u2018Wizfi-o Patronum\u2019 as well which is excellent at protecting yourself from dark wizards online. You can also download the Charmify app, which surprisingly is not a dating site, but the equivalent of Spotify for muggles, to discover all the newest sounds. Now you\u2019re ready to explore the web (Ron Weasley is traumatized), so have fun and, if you are currently a student at Hogwarts, do NOT make McGonagall angry. That woman is watching you.</p>",

The frustration has been of many kinds. Some were <i>really</i> frustrated at not being able to send snaps of their pumpkin juices at breakfast to their thousands (or \u201cdozens\u201d) of followers. Many muggle-borns have indeed accused the school of being responsible of them loosing internet fame and therefore causing them emotional distress. Other students have approached the issue on a more scholarly level, one that the school board could understand. It is certainly true that Internet can be useful for academic purposes, and that it can save time, especially when doing a research. Anyway, the ministry have heard the cries of these students, and also the cries of other wizards who had heard of the benefits (and some other non-beneficial stuff) of the use of Internet from their fellow muggle-born classmates. The ministry have studied the question, and in 2011 the Wiz-fi was born.</p><p>For example, have you guys heard of <a href=\"http://www.hogwartslibrary.sch.uk\" target=\"_blank\">www.hogwartslibrary.sch.uk</a> ? This website is so useful; everything at Hogwarts\u2019 library is now on this website. Just go take a look and you will see what I mean. There is even an option at the bottom left where you can request an owl to deliver the book to you, no matter where you are in the world. One feature I really like to use, and I use it very often when I am in public transports, is that you can click on the tiny wand icon under each book, and the magical autonomous wand that has been set at Hogwarts, \u2013 a similar magic to the one that had been used for the sorting hat centuries ago has been used for this wand \u2013, knows in just a few seconds that you have made a request, and it goes to the book and taps it (even if the book is currently in someone\u2019s dorm and not in the library \u2013 which has caused not-so hilarious situations in which students tried to catch the wand to lock it in their bedside table). When the wand taps the book, it creates a connection between you and the book. It is not much different than a telephone, only it is one-sided. So, the content of the book arrives to you, and you can hear the book directly from the author. Confused? Do not be. Just like a painting of someone can speak to you, the book of an author can speak to you about itself from the author\u2019s viewpoint, because it contains the consciousness of that person as it existed during the moment the book was written. Sometimes, you will even hear the author saying something that is clearly not in the book, like him or her shouting bad words because his or her back pocket set on fire as he or she forgot to put his or her wand on his or her desk before sitting to write his or her book. So it is really fantastic, and a nice immersion. For the moment, it is still one-sided, unlike a painting, so you can\u2019t actually talk and expect a reply, but the ministry are working on a way to change that. They would like to make the project similar to the way paintings work. It would then be possible to access the author\u2019s mind, and to ask him or her what he or she was truly thinking about a subject he or she wrote about, etc. The ministry have succeeded a few months ago one of their experiments, but only on the original book of an author, not on copies of that book, and it is to note that it worked only because the author of said-book is still alive, and participated and agreed to the experiment. Just like paintings are usually made when the wizard is alive, not when he\u2019s dead. Hearing the author shouting bad words because of his or her left buttock catching fire is still possible, for the reason that this happened through the consciousness of the author at a specific moment during the writing, while the author certainly did not have you and your question in his or her consciousness with a ready answer while writing. Maybe he or she imagined someone would ask your question and imagined an answer, but what is to remember from the magic used here is that what is caught by it is what the author expressed. So the bad words can be heard because the author expressed them outwardly, just like the book is an outward expression of his or her mind. The rest remains private, at least when in comes to today\u2019s wiztech.\u00a0</p><p>In the title of this article, I mentioned wi-fi and wiz-fi. There is a difference to make, and it can be understood more easily with the example of hogwartslibrary.sch.uk. You are now familiar with the audio option, but what you might not know if you have never used it before is that you do not actually need earplugs or any other speakers for that matter. You just need to be a wizard, because your own magic is at the other end, it is the receiver. Briefly, the Wiz-fi (wiz for wizard) knows who is using it. If you are using muggle wi-fi it is still ok. You would think that it could not recognize you because it is muggle, which is true, but the fact is some websites like hogwartslibrary.sch.uk are on a stable Wiz-fi line, such as Hogwarts\u2019 Wiz-fi, and what is special about that Wiz-fi is that it repels muggles (not physically, but it does not recognize muggle people or things as receivers, so it would even repel muggle wi-fi in some way, not destroy it but rather overtake it. So if you are muggle, the Wiz-fi will not be able to find you, so the page you are trying to open will not appear. But, if you are a wizard, the Wiz-fi will repel everything muggle and will realize that you are there, so it will connect. If you are in Hogwarts, you can still connect to muggle websites, because the Wiz-fi can read the Wi-fi, and modify it and still be readable, just like you can turn a mp4 to an avi format. The repel is solely on finding the receiver, not on the actual line.</p><p>The Wiz-fi still has some problems though, and one of them is that in some cities muggles and wizards live together, so sometimes the Wiz-fi will work on a muggle computer even if it is currently used by a muggle, because a wizard is in proximity. It is a matter of some meters, and sometimes it also depends on your sound volume on your device. Especially when it comes to audio stuff, the whole point is to be able to listen to it, right? So to be in hearing distance, etc. It rarely happens, but some wizards still end up in weird situations, like starting to hear stuff in their head that they can\u2019t control, and it only stops if they leave the place they are currently at, etc. And we can understand why these wizards who have experienced this have been annoyed, so, yes, it is clearly an issue. But as just said, it rarely happens, mostly because muggles usually do not know any wizarding websites, for obvious reasons.</p><p>In the past, there used to be another issue that thankfully has been resolved, and it concerned privacy. A wizard only needed to be closer to the device than the person who was actually using it, to hear what the person was listening to, and also in that case the person who wanted to hear had his connection cut and could not hear anymore until the other person left. But as said, this issue has been resolved in a very great way. Now, it is possible to choose how many people will be using the Wiz-fi, so you can enter one person and this way the connection will not switch to someone else, because it will realize the receiver is different (however it will stop entirely until you decide to start it back again, which can indeed be annoying too), or you can accept multiple receivers and then make group sessions, which was not possible before.\u00a0</p><p>Back to the issue on muggles ending up being on the Wiz-fi, which mostly concerns websites and features that do not use this audio thingy (though it could still be playable through speakers on muggle devices), if the wizard leaves and the muggle is still using Wiz-fi, then the Wiz-fi will realize it and will start opening several tabs and windows will pop up saying stuff like: \u201cthere\u2019s a virus on your computer\u201d or more often \u201cdid you really believe wizards exist. ah ah. you just a muggle\u2019\u2019, and sometimes websites like the ones affiliated to Hogwarts feel like joking, and ask the muggle, for example, if they would rather be in hufflepuff or in slytherin, or if they believe Nick should have the right to enter the <i>My-head-was-entirely-cut-off-my-body bowling group</i>, and the muggle just ends up super confused, leaves Wiz-fi to search these groups on google, and do not find anything, and therefore abandon.\u00a0<br></p><p>Another big issue with Wiz-fi has been that the wizard or witch\u2019s magic is the whole reason why it is working. It can\u2019t operate without magic, and this is really a big issue when it comes to squibs. Thankfully, the great Hermione Granger is working on their rights, and the ministry are working on a concept.\u00a0</p><p>As you already know, squibs, since they are from a wizarding family, are registered at the ministry, unlike regular muggles (who could end up having muggle-born children, meaning they are technically squibs of many generations who have not been registered). So, squibs have the right to enter the wizarding world, they know about the ministry, they can shop at wizarding stores, etc. So back to the subject, the ministry are working on a concept, and they hope it will be realized by 2021. They want to create some sort of device that would only be available after a formal request of the squib. A muggle could not fill this form, first because they do not know about the ministry, even less where it is, nor do they know about the wiz-fi, and because the ministry would know they are not part of the community since they are unregistered. So squibs, since they are registered, are protected and will be made aware of all the steps to take in order to have the right to access the wiz-fi legally. Once he or she will make the request for the wiz-fi device, the squib will then have a mark on him or herself from now on to make sure that the device is used only by the squib. The device would act basically like a data plan. It would contain enough magic in order to use the Wiz-fi. Autonomous magic, just like the sorting hat once again, or even the room of requirements, that is, by the way, still slowly healing itself and should be back on track in a few years, since it had been protected with a very powerful repairing charm (its creator was truly brilliant and very much talented). The wiz-fi device for squibs would only need a wizard to create it, to store the necessary magic once, and it would keep on going without any conscious help afterwards. This stored magic could only be used for what it has been created, that is to say the Wiz-fi.\u00a0</p><p>Now you may be thinking\u2026 But what about the law on the secrecy? What about Hogwarts\u2019 secrets? The first question has already been answered if you paid attention. As for the other possibility, a wizard showing a website to a non-muggle, this can\u2019t be known yet, but the ministry trust the wizarding community to respect the law, just as they expect witches and wizards to respect it for all matters in general, that likewise can\u2019t be known (such as talking to a muggle about the existence of dragons, for instance). As for the second, this is a matter that concerns the school alone and has already been resolved very quickly. Yes, students can now send snaps of their pumpkin juice. However, only someone who has been to Hogwarts can actually see the background clearly, if it shows or reveals too much of Hogwarts. It would have been too difficult to work this magic on the Wiz-fi line, so as Hogwarts is a special case, the grounds have been through a Wiz-fi-photo-and-video-captures repeller for non-students-and-alumni, meaning Hogwarts will appear differently to those who do not know Hogwarts, just like the actual castle would appear differently to a muggle if he or she were to be standing next to its grounds. The background remains neutral, and stuff that would not reveal anything such as some stones or grass and trees outside would not be enough for the repel charm to be in action, so people can still make beautiful snaps in their actual contexts, when they are not revealing of Hogwarts\u2019 secrets. And obviously it is impossible to use the localization feature, since Hogwarts does not figure on the Wizmap and only the Wiz-fi is usable on its grounds (and not the wi-fi, which on the other hand <i>could</i> localize the place, as it considers the position on the planet and not only already known places). Because of this localization issue only related to specific places like Hogwarts and some special offices of the ministry, the ministry do not have access either to the use that is being made by the students at Hogwarts. Some students, thinking this meant their research history would remain entirely private, have had the surprise of getting a detention from the headmistress. *Slow claps*. It is also forbidden to be used during classes, unless specfied otherwise by the teachers (which does not happen very often).</p><p>And that is it! I now invite you to visit some wizarding websites. Some very interesting links can be found on hogwartslibrary.sch.uk while simply using the website search bar feature at the top right of the page.

Some very interesting links can be found on hogwartslibrary.sch.uk while simply using the website search bar feature at the top right of the page. Their algorithm to find the best sources is really on top. I also highly suggest you to download the &lsquo;Wizfi-o Patronum&rsquo; as well which is excellent at protecting yourself from dark wizards online. You can also download the Charmify app, which surprisingly is not a dating site, but the equivalent of Spotify for muggles, to discover all the newest sounds. Now you&rsquo;re ready to explore the web (Ron Weasley is traumatized), so have fun and, if you are currently a student at Hogwarts, do NOT make McGonagall angry. That woman is watching you.</p>",
