Who stays up late and pushes and <i>pushes </i>to be better than all of his peers, to live up to what\u2019s expected of him and - more importantly - what he expects from himself.

Who\u2019s arrogant and antisocial, until he finds friends that don\u2019t care what his name is, or treat him any differently for it. Who\u2019s fiercely loyal to those friends, and secretly tender around all forms of life that aren\u2019t human. Whose ambition and ruthlessness only comes from being told that\u2019s what he had to want, and who softens and slowly accepts that he can take time and learn who he really is outside of an al Ghul or a Wayne, once he realizes that the people whose opinions he values will still care for him, no matter what house he\u2019s in.</p>",
