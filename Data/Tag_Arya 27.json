        "body": "<h1>An Unexpected Journey: Part 8</h1><p>The vast amounts of wine that Arya had consumed was beginning to take effect. In all her years, she\u2019s never had more than two goblets. She\u2019s never really like the feeling that the wine would make one feel. She wanted to keep her wits about her; keep her mind focus for anything that may be thrown her way. Even on her travels west, she never drank more than what she felt comfortable with. She had a crew to keep and maintain. If she wasn\u2019t at her top performance, she could have endangered everyone on her ship. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tonight was a different story. Between the judging crowd and the looks from the high Lords and Ladies of the Stormlands, Arya threw caution right over her shoulder. She was four goblets in and pouring her fifth after that encounter with Lady Jeyne Swann. She hadn\u2019t been this relaxed for a long time and it was an invigorating feeling. She was chatting and laughing and truly did not care what the people of the Stomrlands were saying about her. </p><p><br/></p><p>Lady Rena was even enjoying herself. She did not have to worry about her children for a night and it was liberating. She loved her children, Gods knew that, but being a mother, wife, and a new lady was beginning to take a toll on the young woman. Having one night to enjoy the company around her was an escaping feeling. And making a new friend was a nice perk. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya was observing the young lady. She reminded her of her sister, Sansa. The auburn hair, the blue eyes, even the way she held herself as a woman. It was a comfort to Arya, for she never really had friends before; at least not friends that were women. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSo Lady Rena, when will you be leaving tonight? It is getting late and the roads are no safe place, even if your keep is a short rides away from here.\u201d Arya asked her. </p><p><br/></p><p>Rena\u2019s gaze tore from that of her husbands and landed on Arya. Truth be told, she had not heard a single word Arya had said. She was preoccupied ogling her husband from the other side of the high table. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI do apologize, but I seemed to not have heard you. What was it you wanted.\u201d Rena asked her. Her eyes going back and forth between Arya and her husband. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya noticed Rena\u2019s averting gaze and smiled. \u201cI have a feeling you and your husband will be staying here at Storm\u2019s End tonight.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Rena waved her hand dismissively, \u201cNonsense. Beside Ser Davos did not tell the maids to set up rooms for us.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Lord Baratheon can acquire some rooms for you and your family, Lady Rena.\u201d Arya reassured her. </p><p>Rena nodded; a slight blush rising to her cheeks. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThere is no need to be embarrassed. He\u2019s your husband. If you want to bed him, then bed him.\u201d Arya told her as she took yet another sip from her goblet. </p><p><br/></p><p>Rena\u2019s cheeks grew an even darker shade of crimson. \u201cI cannot bed my husband here! Not with the Lord Paramount under the same roof.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m sure what Gendry doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Rena looked passed Arya and noticed that Gendry\u2019s seat was empty. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhere is the Lord? I did not noticed he left.\u201d She asked Arya. </p><p>\u201cAye, he went to check on Lyra and Ginger. It is late, so they are more than not, sleeping. I do have to ask, where is your son?\u201d Arya asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back at home at our keep with my brother. They rode before supper. He was getting fussy and my brother offered to look after the babe.\u201d She gave a small chuckle \u201cGods bless him. He had expected that we would not return home tonight.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd he is capable of caring for the babe?\u201d Arya asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>Rena nodded, \u201cAye. Sometimes I think he can care for the babe better than I can. He has always loved the children. Preferred their company over gents and lasses here at the castle.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya tore a piece of bread and stuffed in her mouth, \u201cHe works in the stables? The new stables master, am I right? After your father passed away?\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Rena raised her eyebrows, surprise covered her face, \u201cYou know more than you let on.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya smiled, \u201cGendry and I talked for a bit before supper. He may have said a few things.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell yes, he is the new stables master, but he does not want to be. Our father taught us everything and after he passed, naturally it went to my brother.\u201d Rena\u2019s face fell. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya could tell that Rena was disappointed. \u201cAnd you wanted to be the new stables master.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Rena nodded her head. She wanted to be stables master more than anything, even more than being a lady, but it was deemed not proper. Her father had taught her and her brother everything he knew, but it was Rena who applied his teachings. She was the one that knew how to care for the animals while her brother just sat and watched. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cEvery time we come to the castle, I make sure to check on the bloody beasts. I check their shoes and change their feed. I even brush them. My brother does none of that. If it weren\u2019t for me, the Lord would not have any horses.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell, just ask Gendry that you want to be the knew stables master.\u201d Arya said as if it was truly no problem. </p><p><br/></p><p>Rena gave a curt laugh, \u201cI cannot just ask the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands to make me his new stables master. Things may have changed since you\u2019ve been gone, Lady Arya. But some things remain the same.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya reaches for Rena. She placed a small hand onto of hers, \u201cYou leave Gendry to me. You\u2019ll be the new stables master yet. Now, go and bed your husband.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Rena lets out a laugh, \u201cThe last time I bedded my husband at a celebration like this, I ended up with his babe in my belly.\u201d Rena looked over to her husband once more. She got up from her seat beside Arya and made her way to her husband. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya saw the couple depart the depleting crowd. Most everyone had left to sleep off the wine in their bellies or to fuck the seven hells out of their lovers. The only ones that remained were the few that were too drunk to move or too tired to care. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya herself was ready to leave the great hall and find a soft bed to lay her head, for the wine had truly taken its toll. She was lifting from her seat when she realized the great hall was swimming. Her balance was off and she gripped the table for support, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Before she realized, she was toppling over her chair. But before she slammed back into her chair a pair of strong arms grabbed her from behind. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cToo much wine?\u201d His soft voice tickled her ear. </p><p><br/></p><p>She turned in his grasp to face him. \u201cJust a bit.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow about we get you to bed? Come, the maids have set up a room for you.\u201d He grasped her waist and lead her from the great hall. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d She asks as the walk the corridors of the castle. </p><p><br/></p><p>Gendry chuckles, \u201cI am taking you to your room so you can sleep off the wine.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya abruptly stopped. She turned to face Gendry and grabbed his hands. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to my room.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Grendry\u2019s eyebrows scrunch in confusion. \u201cAnd where would you like to go? I am not taking you to the archery, you are far to drunk to shoot an arrow.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya shakes her head, \u201cYou really are a stupid bull, you know that? No, Gendry, I want you to take me to your bed.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Gendry\u2019s eyes widen. He begins to protest when Arya crashes her lips to his. This time it was her turn to steal a kiss and perhaps more. He tasted of ale and smokiness and she deepened the kiss. She wanted to taste more of him. To devour every inch of him. She broke away from him, just for a moment to say one word. \u201cPlease.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>It was the confirmation that Gendry needed. He lifted her up and began walking towards his solar. He slammed her against his chamber door, fiddling with the latch. He couldn\u2019t see where the bloody handle was, for he was too busy kissing the love of his life. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh let me!\u201d Arya gasped as she escaped his mouth to open the door. </p><p><br/></p><p>They tumbled inside chuckling as they began to rip at each other\u2019s clothes. Arya pulled her small clothes off while Gendry helped. It had been so long since she had been intimate with anyone, especially him. </p><p><br/></p><p>Their first time had been due to the fact there was impending death beating at their back door. It was clumsy and painful, but still enjoyable. Since then she had been with one other man and woman, but neither could satisfy her the way Gendry had that night in the forge.</p><p><br/></p><p>Gendry had only been with one woman after Arya. On a stupid drunken night in King\u2019s Landing. It had been a moon since she had left for her voyage and Gendry was in a bad place. He hadn\u2019t been back to Storm\u2019s End and he just wanted to forget about everything that had happened in his life. After the incident he swore he would never lay with another woman again, and he didn\u2019t, not even with his wife. </p><p><br/></p><p>They explored each other\u2019s bodies, basking in each other\u2019s scent. It was familiar but also foreign, for it had been years since they touched each other. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya didn\u2019t know where she ended and he began. It was like they were two parts of a missing puzzle that needed to be put back together. This is home, she thought. This is where I want to be. </p><p><br/></p><p>*****</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya was spent. They had ravaged each other\u2019s bodies for what seemed like hours. The smell of sex and wine filled the air of the high lord\u2019s bedroom. Arya was sticky with sweat, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to untangle her limbs from Gendry\u2019s. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSo How was it?\u201d She asked him after sometime. </p><p><br/></p><p>Gendry looked down at her. She was nuzzled perfectly into him. \u201cIt was amazing. Truly! I haven\u2019t felt anything in a long time and then you came back and all of those thoughts and emotions hit me so hard.\u201d Arya nuzzled closer to him. \u201cI just hate that I took advantage of a drunk woman.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya lightly punched his shoulder, \u201cYou did not take advantage of me! If anything, I took advantage of you. I was the one who kissed you, remember?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHmm, maybe I need a reminder.\u201d He said to her as he drew her closer. He pressed his lips to her, taking her all in. They were getting entangled with one another once more when the handle of his bed chambers began to shake. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya pulled away, bringing the furs close to her body. \u201cWho could that be? Lyra, perhaps.\u201d She asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>Gendry shook his head, \u201cNo, Lyra only comes to my chambers when the sun rises. That\u2019s Jeyne Swann.\u201d His voice was cold when he said her name. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya looked at him with questioning eyes. \u201cAnd how would you know?\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Gendry gets off the bed, pulling on his trousers, \u201cBecause this is not the first time she\u2019s tried to come to my chambers in the dead of night. Every time we have some sort of celebration, she tries to make her way in here, hoping for something. It\u2019s a blessing by the Gods that I remember to lock the door.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He makes his way towards the door, getting ready to open it when Arya stops him. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d She climbs off his feather bed and makes her way towards the door, she doesn\u2019t attempt to cover up. She unlatches the lock and pulls it open. </p><p><br/></p><p>There standing in the archway was Jeyne Swann. Her face was pale; the only color coming from the blush of her cheeks. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGood evening, Lady Jeyne, May I help you with something?\u201d Arya asks. The cool breeze that came from the corridor behind Lady Jeyne made her nipples harden. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI-I was not aware the lord had company.\u201d Her words faltered, but she remained her composure. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI am not company, Lady Jeyne. I am Arya Stark and Gendry Baratheon is my betrothed. If you ever try to come into our chambers again, I can promise you that will never be able to set foot in Storm\u2019s End again. Do I make myself understood?\u201d Arya\u2019s voice was dripping with venom. She wasn\u2019t the jealous type, but Jeyne Swann had pushed Arya a little to far. </p><p><br/></p><p>Jeyne\u2019s face grew with terror. She quickly shook her head, gave a curtsy and turned from the chamber door. Arya slammed the door behind her, turning to look at Gendry. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s alright. Me being your betrothed?\u201d She placed a hand onto his bare chest. </p><p><br/></p><p>Gendry took Arya\u2019s face into his hands. \u201cI love you. You know that?\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGood, because I love you too.\u201d She told him as she grabbed one of his hands and made their way back to the bed. </p><p><br/></p><p>*****</p><p>Arya was sound asleep when she felt a small body climb on top of her. She opened her eyes to see a pair of brown ones look down at her. </p><p><br/></p><p>Lyra was staring at Arya, glancing between her and Gendry. </p><p><br/></p><p>Arya couldn\u2019t tell what the 3 year old was thinking. She had remember that Gendry said Lyra liked to come into his chambers once the sun broke the horizon, so she didn\u2019t latch the door. They had been mindful and had clothed before falling asleep, afraid that Lyra might find them in a precarious situation. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cLyra, good morrow.\u201d Arya whispered. Gendry was softly snoring at her side, she didn\u2019t want to wake him. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGood morrow. There is mud outside. Can we play?\u201d She asked Arya. </p><p><br/></p><p>A smile grew on Arya\u2019s face. \u201cOf course, but shhh, let us not wake your father.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Lyra climbed off of Arya and went to sit at the table across the room. Arya lifted from the bed and pulled her jerkin on over her small clothes fastening the laces. She pulled on her boots and walked towards Lyra, reaching her hand out for her to grasp. </p><p><br/></p><p>Lyra instantly took Arya\u2019s hand and they made their way to the courtyard below. </p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>An Unexpected Journey: Part 8</h1><p>The vast amounts of wine that Arya had consumed was beginning to take effect. In all her years, she\u2019s never had more than two goblets. She\u2019s never really like the feeling that the wine would make one feel. She wanted to keep her wits about her; keep her mind focus for anything that may be thrown her way. Even on her travels west, she never drank more than what she felt comfortable with. She had a crew to keep and maintain. If she wasn\u2019t at her top performance, she could have endangered everyone on her ship. </p><p><br></p><p>Tonight was a different story. Between the judging crowd and the looks from the high Lords and Ladies of the Stormlands, Arya threw caution right over her shoulder. She was four goblets in and pouring her fifth after that encounter with Lady Jeyne Swann. She hadn\u2019t been this relaxed for a long time and it was an invigorating feeling. She was chatting and laughing and truly did not care what the people of the Stomrlands were saying about her. </p><p><br></p><p>Lady Rena was even enjoying herself. She did not have to worry about her children for a night and it was liberating. She loved her children, Gods knew that, but being a mother, wife, and a new lady was beginning to take a toll on the young woman. Having one night to enjoy the company around her was an escaping feeling. And making a new friend was a nice perk. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya was observing the young lady. She reminded her of her sister, Sansa. The auburn hair, the blue eyes, even the way she held herself as a woman. It was a comfort to Arya, for she never really had friends before; at least not friends that were women. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo Lady Rena, when will you be leaving tonight? It is getting late and the roads are no safe place, even if your keep is a short rides away from here.\u201d Arya asked her. </p><p><br></p><p>Rena\u2019s gaze tore from that of her husbands and landed on Arya. Truth be told, she had not heard a single word Arya had said. She was preoccupied ogling her husband from the other side of the high table. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI do apologize, but I seemed to not have heard you. What was it you wanted.\u201d Rena asked her. Her eyes going back and forth between Arya and her husband. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya noticed Rena\u2019s averting gaze and smiled. \u201cI have a feeling you and your husband will be staying here at Storm\u2019s End tonight.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Rena waved her hand dismissively, \u201cNonsense. Beside Ser Davos did not tell the maids to set up rooms for us.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Lord Baratheon can acquire some rooms for you and your family, Lady Rena.\u201d Arya reassured her. </p><p>Rena nodded; a slight blush rising to her cheeks. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere is no need to be embarrassed. He\u2019s your husband. If you want to bed him, then bed him.\u201d Arya told her as she took yet another sip from her goblet. </p><p><br></p><p>Rena\u2019s cheeks grew an even darker shade of crimson. \u201cI cannot bed my husband here! Not with the Lord Paramount under the same roof.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m sure what Gendry doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Rena looked passed Arya and noticed that Gendry\u2019s seat was empty. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhere is the Lord? I did not noticed he left.\u201d She asked Arya. </p><p>\u201cAye, he went to check on Lyra and Ginger. It is late, so they are more than not, sleeping. I do have to ask, where is your son?\u201d Arya asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back at home at our keep with my brother. They rode before supper. He was getting fussy and my brother offered to look after the babe.\u201d She gave a small chuckle \u201cGods bless him. He had expected that we would not return home tonight.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd he is capable of caring for the babe?\u201d Arya asked. </p><p><br></p><p>Rena nodded, \u201cAye. Sometimes I think he can care for the babe better than I can. He has always loved the children. Preferred their company over gents and lasses here at the castle.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya tore a piece of bread and stuffed in her mouth, \u201cHe works in the stables? The new stables master, am I right? After your father passed away?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Rena raised her eyebrows, surprise covered her face, \u201cYou know more than you let on.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya smiled, \u201cGendry and I talked for a bit before supper. He may have said a few things.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell yes, he is the new stables master, but he does not want to be. Our father taught us everything and after he passed, naturally it went to my brother.\u201d Rena\u2019s face fell. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya could tell that Rena was disappointed. \u201cAnd you wanted to be the new stables master.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Rena nodded her head. She wanted to be stables master more than anything, even more than being a lady, but it was deemed not proper. Her father had taught her and her brother everything he knew, but it was Rena who applied his teachings. She was the one that knew how to care for the animals while her brother just sat and watched. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cEvery time we come to the castle, I make sure to check on the bloody beasts. I check their shoes and change their feed. I even brush them. My brother does none of that. If it weren\u2019t for me, the Lord would not have any horses.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell, just ask Gendry that you want to be the knew stables master.\u201d Arya said as if it was truly no problem. </p><p><br></p><p>Rena gave a curt laugh, \u201cI cannot just ask the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands to make me his new stables master. Things may have changed since you\u2019ve been gone, Lady Arya. But some things remain the same.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya reaches for Rena. She placed a small hand onto of hers, \u201cYou leave Gendry to me. You\u2019ll be the new stables master yet. Now, go and bed your husband.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Rena lets out a laugh, \u201cThe last time I bedded my husband at a celebration like this, I ended up with his babe in my belly.\u201d Rena looked over to her husband once more. She got up from her seat beside Arya and made her way to her husband. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya saw the couple depart the depleting crowd. Most everyone had left to sleep off the wine in their bellies or to fuck the seven hells out of their lovers. The only ones that remained were the few that were too drunk to move or too tired to care. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya herself was ready to leave the great hall and find a soft bed to lay her head, for the wine had truly taken its toll. She was lifting from her seat when she realized the great hall was swimming. Her balance was off and she gripped the table for support, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Before she realized, she was toppling over her chair. But before she slammed back into her chair a pair of strong arms grabbed her from behind. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cToo much wine?\u201d His soft voice tickled her ear. </p><p><br></p><p>She turned in his grasp to face him. \u201cJust a bit.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow about we get you to bed? Come, the maids have set up a room for you.\u201d He grasped her waist and lead her from the great hall. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d She asks as the walk the corridors of the castle. </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry chuckles, \u201cI am taking you to your room so you can sleep off the wine.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya abruptly stopped. She turned to face Gendry and grabbed his hands. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to my room.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Grendry\u2019s eyebrows scrunch in confusion. \u201cAnd where would you like to go? I am not taking you to the archery, you are far to drunk to shoot an arrow.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya shakes her head, \u201cYou really are a stupid bull, you know that? No, Gendry, I want you to take me to your bed.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry\u2019s eyes widen. He begins to protest when Arya crashes her lips to his. This time it was her turn to steal a kiss and perhaps more. He tasted of ale and smokiness and she deepened the kiss. She wanted to taste more of him. To devour every inch of him. She broke away from him, just for a moment to say one word. \u201cPlease.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>It was the confirmation that Gendry needed. He lifted her up and began walking towards his solar. He slammed her against his chamber door, fiddling with the latch. He couldn\u2019t see where the bloody handle was, for he was too busy kissing the love of his life. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh let me!\u201d Arya gasped as she escaped his mouth to open the door. </p><p><br></p><p>They tumbled inside chuckling as they began to rip at each other\u2019s clothes. Arya pulled her small clothes off while Gendry helped. It had been so long since she had been intimate with anyone, especially him. </p><p><br></p><p>Their first time had been due to the fact there was impending death beating at their back door. It was clumsy and painful, but still enjoyable. Since then she had been with one other man and woman, but neither could satisfy her the way Gendry had that night in the forge.</p><p><br></p><p>Gendry had only been with one woman after Arya. On a stupid drunken night in King\u2019s Landing. It had been a moon since she had left for her voyage and Gendry was in a bad place. He hadn\u2019t been back to Storm\u2019s End and he just wanted to forget about everything that had happened in his life. After the incident he swore he would never lay with another woman again, and he didn\u2019t, not even with his wife. </p><p><br></p><p>They explored each other\u2019s bodies, basking in each other\u2019s scent. It was familiar but also foreign, for it had been years since they touched each other. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya didn\u2019t know where she ended and he began. It was like they were two parts of a missing puzzle that needed to be put back together. This is home, she thought. This is where I want to be. </p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p><br></p><p>Arya was spent. They had ravaged each other\u2019s bodies for what seemed like hours. The smell of sex and wine filled the air of the high lord\u2019s bedroom. Arya was sticky with sweat, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to untangle her limbs from Gendry\u2019s. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo How was it?\u201d She asked him after sometime. </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry looked down at her. She was nuzzled perfectly into him. \u201cIt was amazing. Truly! I haven\u2019t felt anything in a long time and then you came back and all of those thoughts and emotions hit me so hard.\u201d Arya nuzzled closer to him. \u201cI just hate that I took advantage of a drunk woman.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya lightly punched his shoulder, \u201cYou did not take advantage of me! If anything, I took advantage of you. I was the one who kissed you, remember?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHmm, maybe I need a reminder.\u201d He said to her as he drew her closer. He pressed his lips to her, taking her all in. They were getting entangled with one another once more when the handle of his bed chambers began to shake. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya pulled away, bringing the furs close to her body. \u201cWho could that be? Lyra, perhaps.\u201d She asked. </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry shook his head, \u201cNo, Lyra only comes to my chambers when the sun rises. That\u2019s Jeyne Swann.\u201d His voice was cold when he said her name. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya looked at him with questioning eyes. \u201cAnd how would you know?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry gets off the bed, pulling on his trousers, \u201cBecause this is not the first time she\u2019s tried to come to my chambers in the dead of night.

Beside Ser Davos did not tell the maids to set up rooms for us.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Lord Baratheon can acquire some rooms for you and your family, Lady Rena.\u201d Arya reassured her. </p><p>Rena nodded; a slight blush rising to her cheeks. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere is no need to be embarrassed. He\u2019s your husband. If you want to bed him, then bed him.\u201d Arya told her as she took yet another sip from her goblet. </p><p><br></p><p>Rena\u2019s cheeks grew an even darker shade of crimson. \u201cI cannot bed my husband here! Not with the Lord Paramount under the same roof.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m sure what Gendry doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Rena looked passed Arya and noticed that Gendry\u2019s seat was empty. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhere is the Lord? I did not noticed he left.\u201d She asked Arya. </p><p>\u201cAye, he went to check on Lyra and Ginger. It is late, so they are more than not, sleeping. I do have to ask, where is your son?\u201d Arya asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back at home at our keep with my brother. They rode before supper. He was getting fussy and my brother offered to look after the babe.\u201d She gave a small chuckle \u201cGods bless him. He had expected that we would not return home tonight.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd he is capable of caring for the babe?\u201d Arya asked. </p><p><br></p><p>Rena nodded, \u201cAye. Sometimes I think he can care for the babe better than I can. He has always loved the children. Preferred their company over gents and lasses here at the castle.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya tore a piece of bread and stuffed in her mouth, \u201cHe works in the stables? The new stables master, am I right? After your father passed away?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Rena raised her eyebrows, surprise covered her face, \u201cYou know more than you let on.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya smiled, \u201cGendry and I talked for a bit before supper. He may have said a few things.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell yes, he is the new stables master, but he does not want to be. Our father taught us everything and after he passed, naturally it went to my brother.\u201d Rena\u2019s face fell. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya could tell that Rena was disappointed. \u201cAnd you wanted to be the new stables master.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Rena nodded her head. She wanted to be stables master more than anything, even more than being a lady, but it was deemed not proper. Her father had taught her and her brother everything he knew, but it was Rena who applied his teachings. She was the one that knew how to care for the animals while her brother just sat and watched. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cEvery time we come to the castle, I make sure to check on the bloody beasts. I check their shoes and change their feed. I even brush them. My brother does none of that. If it weren\u2019t for me, the Lord would not have any horses.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell, just ask Gendry that you want to be the knew stables master.\u201d Arya said as if it was truly no problem. </p><p><br></p><p>Rena gave a curt laugh, \u201cI cannot just ask the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands to make me his new stables master. Things may have changed since you\u2019ve been gone, Lady Arya. But some things remain the same.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya reaches for Rena. She placed a small hand onto of hers, \u201cYou leave Gendry to me. You\u2019ll be the new stables master yet. Now, go and bed your husband.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Rena lets out a laugh, \u201cThe last time I bedded my husband at a celebration like this, I ended up with his babe in my belly.\u201d Rena looked over to her husband once more. She got up from her seat beside Arya and made her way to her husband. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya saw the couple depart the depleting crowd. Most everyone had left to sleep off the wine in their bellies or to fuck the seven hells out of their lovers. The only ones that remained were the few that were too drunk to move or too tired to care. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya herself was ready to leave the great hall and find a soft bed to lay her head, for the wine had truly taken its toll. She was lifting from her seat when she realized the great hall was swimming. Her balance was off and she gripped the table for support, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Before she realized, she was toppling over her chair. But before she slammed back into her chair a pair of strong arms grabbed her from behind. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cToo much wine?\u201d His soft voice tickled her ear. </p><p><br></p><p>She turned in his grasp to face him. \u201cJust a bit.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow about we get you to bed? Come, the maids have set up a room for you.\u201d He grasped her waist and lead her from the great hall. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d She asks as the walk the corridors of the castle. </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry chuckles, \u201cI am taking you to your room so you can sleep off the wine.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya abruptly stopped. She turned to face Gendry and grabbed his hands. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to my room.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Grendry\u2019s eyebrows scrunch in confusion. \u201cAnd where would you like to go? I am not taking you to the archery, you are far to drunk to shoot an arrow.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya shakes her head, \u201cYou really are a stupid bull, you know that? No, Gendry, I want you to take me to your bed.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry\u2019s eyes widen. He begins to protest when Arya crashes her lips to his. This time it was her turn to steal a kiss and perhaps more. He tasted of ale and smokiness and she deepened the kiss. She wanted to taste more of him. To devour every inch of him. She broke away from him, just for a moment to say one word. \u201cPlease.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>It was the confirmation that Gendry needed. He lifted her up and began walking towards his solar. He slammed her against his chamber door, fiddling with the latch. He couldn\u2019t see where the bloody handle was, for he was too busy kissing the love of his life. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh let me!\u201d Arya gasped as she escaped his mouth to open the door. </p><p><br></p><p>They tumbled inside chuckling as they began to rip at each other\u2019s clothes. Arya pulled her small clothes off while Gendry helped. It had been so long since she had been intimate with anyone, especially him. </p><p><br></p><p>Their first time had been due to the fact there was impending death beating at their back door. It was clumsy and painful, but still enjoyable. Since then she had been with one other man and woman, but neither could satisfy her the way Gendry had that night in the forge.</p><p><br></p><p>Gendry had only been with one woman after Arya. On a stupid drunken night in King\u2019s Landing. It had been a moon since she had left for her voyage and Gendry was in a bad place. He hadn\u2019t been back to Storm\u2019s End and he just wanted to forget about everything that had happened in his life. After the incident he swore he would never lay with another woman again, and he didn\u2019t, not even with his wife. </p><p><br></p><p>They explored each other\u2019s bodies, basking in each other\u2019s scent. It was familiar but also foreign, for it had been years since they touched each other. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya didn\u2019t know where she ended and he began. It was like they were two parts of a missing puzzle that needed to be put back together. This is home, she thought. This is where I want to be. </p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p><br></p><p>Arya was spent. They had ravaged each other\u2019s bodies for what seemed like hours. The smell of sex and wine filled the air of the high lord\u2019s bedroom. Arya was sticky with sweat, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to untangle her limbs from Gendry\u2019s. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo How was it?\u201d She asked him after sometime. </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry looked down at her. She was nuzzled perfectly into him. \u201cIt was amazing. Truly! I haven\u2019t felt anything in a long time and then you came back and all of those thoughts and emotions hit me so hard.\u201d Arya nuzzled closer to him. \u201cI just hate that I took advantage of a drunk woman.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Arya lightly punched his shoulder, \u201cYou did not take advantage of me! If anything, I took advantage of you. I was the one who kissed you, remember?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHmm, maybe I need a reminder.\u201d He said to her as he drew her closer. He pressed his lips to her, taking her all in. They were getting entangled with one another once more when the handle of his bed chambers began to shake. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya pulled away, bringing the furs close to her body. \u201cWho could that be? Lyra, perhaps.\u201d She asked. </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry shook his head, \u201cNo, Lyra only comes to my chambers when the sun rises. That\u2019s Jeyne Swann.\u201d His voice was cold when he said her name. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya looked at him with questioning eyes. \u201cAnd how would you know?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry gets off the bed, pulling on his trousers, \u201cBecause this is not the first time she\u2019s tried to come to my chambers in the dead of night. Every time we have some sort of celebration, she tries to make her way in here, hoping for something. It\u2019s a blessing by the Gods that I remember to lock the door.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He makes his way towards the door, getting ready to open it when Arya stops him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d She climbs off his feather bed and makes her way towards the door, she doesn\u2019t attempt to cover up. She unlatches the lock and pulls it open. </p><p><br></p><p>There standing in the archway was Jeyne Swann. Her face was pale; the only color coming from the blush of her cheeks. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGood evening, Lady Jeyne, May I help you with something?\u201d Arya asks. The cool breeze that came from the corridor behind Lady Jeyne made her nipples harden. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI-I was not aware the lord had company.\u201d Her words faltered, but she remained her composure. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI am not company, Lady Jeyne. I am Arya Stark and Gendry Baratheon is my betrothed. If you ever try to come into our chambers again, I can promise you that will never be able to set foot in Storm\u2019s End again. Do I make myself understood?\u201d Arya\u2019s voice was dripping with venom. She wasn\u2019t the jealous type, but Jeyne Swann had pushed Arya a little to far. </p><p><br></p><p>Jeyne\u2019s face grew with terror. She quickly shook her head, gave a curtsy and turned from the chamber door. Arya slammed the door behind her, turning to look at Gendry. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s alright. Me being your betrothed?\u201d She placed a hand onto his bare chest. </p><p><br></p><p>Gendry took Arya\u2019s face into his hands. \u201cI love you. You know that?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGood, because I love you too.\u201d She told him as she grabbed one of his hands and made their way back to the bed. </p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>Arya was sound asleep when she felt a small body climb on top of her. She opened her eyes to see a pair of brown ones look down at her. </p><p><br></p><p>Lyra was staring at Arya, glancing between her and Gendry. </p><p><br></p><p>Arya couldn\u2019t tell what the 3 year old was thinking. She had remember that Gendry said Lyra liked to come into his chambers once the sun broke the horizon, so she didn\u2019t latch the door. They had been mindful and had clothed before falling asleep, afraid that Lyra might find them in a precarious situation. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLyra, good morrow.\u201d Arya whispered. Gendry was softly snoring at her side, she didn\u2019t want to wake him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGood morrow. There is mud outside. Can we play?\u201d She asked Arya. </p><p><br></p><p>A smile grew on Arya\u2019s face. \u201cOf course, but shhh, let us not wake your father.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Lyra climbed off of Arya and went to sit at the table across the room. Arya lifted from the bed and pulled her jerkin on over her small clothes fastening the laces. She pulled on her boots and walked towards Lyra, reaching her hand out for her to grasp. </p><p><br></p><p>Lyra instantly took Arya\u2019s hand and they made their way to the courtyard below. </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>An Unexpected Journey: Part 8</h1><p>The vast amounts of wine that Arya had consumed was beginning to take effect. In all her years, she&rsquo;s never had more than two goblets. She&rsquo;s never really like the feeling that the wine would make one feel. She wanted to keep her wits about her; keep her mind focus for anything that may be thrown her way. Even on her travels west, she never drank more than what she felt comfortable with. She had a crew to keep and maintain. If she wasn&rsquo;t at her top performance, she could have endangered everyone on her ship. </p><p><br /></p><p>Tonight was a different story. Between the judging crowd and the looks from the high Lords and Ladies of the Stormlands, Arya threw caution right over her shoulder. She was four goblets in and pouring her fifth after that encounter with Lady Jeyne Swann. She hadn&rsquo;t been this relaxed for a long time and it was an invigorating feeling. She was chatting and laughing and truly did not care what the people of the Stomrlands were saying about her. </p><p><br /></p><p>Lady Rena was even enjoying herself. She did not have to worry about her children for a night and it was liberating. She loved her children, Gods knew that, but being a mother, wife, and a new lady was beginning to take a toll on the young woman. Having one night to enjoy the company around her was an escaping feeling. And making a new friend was a nice perk. </p><p><br /></p><p>Arya was observing the young lady. She reminded her of her sister, Sansa. The auburn hair, the blue eyes, even the way she held herself as a woman. It was a comfort to Arya, for she never really had friends before; at least not friends that were women. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So Lady Rena, when will you be leaving tonight? It is getting late and the roads are no safe place, even if your keep is a short rides away from here.&rdquo; Arya asked her. </p><p><br /></p><p>Rena&rsquo;s gaze tore from that of her husbands and landed on Arya. Truth be told, she had not heard a single word Arya had said. She was preoccupied ogling her husband from the other side of the high table. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I do apologize, but I seemed to not have heard you. What was it you wanted.&rdquo; Rena asked her. Her eyes going back and forth between Arya and her husband. </p><p><br /></p><p>Arya noticed Rena&rsquo;s averting gaze and smiled. &ldquo;I have a feeling you and your husband will be staying here at Storm&rsquo;s End tonight.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Rena waved her hand dismissively, &ldquo;Nonsense.

He&rsquo;s your husband. If you want to bed him, then bed him.&rdquo; Arya told her as she took yet another sip from her goblet. </p><p><br /></p><p>Rena&rsquo;s cheeks grew an even darker shade of crimson. &ldquo;I cannot bed my husband here! Not with the Lord Paramount under the same roof.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Arya shrugged, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure what Gendry doesn&rsquo;t know won&rsquo;t hurt him.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Rena looked passed Arya and noticed that Gendry&rsquo;s seat was empty. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where is the Lord?

She quickly shook her head, gave a curtsy and turned from the chamber door. Arya slammed the door behind her, turning to look at Gendry. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s alright. Me being your betrothed?&rdquo; She placed a hand onto his bare chest. </p><p><br /></p><p>Gendry took Arya&rsquo;s face into his hands. &ldquo;I love you. You know that?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good, because I love you too.&rdquo; She told him as she grabbed one of his hands and made their way back to the bed. </p><p><br /></p><p>*****</p><p>Arya was sound asleep when she felt a small body climb on top of her. She opened her eyes to see a pair of brown ones look down at her. </p><p><br /></p><p>Lyra was staring at Arya, glancing between her and Gendry. </p><p><br /></p><p>Arya couldn&rsquo;t tell what the 3 year old was thinking. She had remember that Gendry said Lyra liked to come into his chambers once the sun broke the horizon, so she didn&rsquo;t latch the door. They had been mindful and had clothed before falling asleep, afraid that Lyra might find them in a precarious situation. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lyra, good morrow.&rdquo; Arya whispered. Gendry was softly snoring at her side, she didn&rsquo;t want to wake him. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good morrow. There is mud outside. Can we play?&rdquo; She asked Arya. </p><p><br /></p><p>A smile grew on Arya&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Of course, but shhh, let us not wake your father.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Lyra climbed off of Arya and went to sit at the table across the room. Arya lifted from the bed and pulled her jerkin on over her small clothes fastening the laces. She pulled on her boots and walked towards Lyra, reaching her hand out for her to grasp. </p><p><br /></p><p>Lyra instantly took Arya&rsquo;s hand and they made their way to the courtyard below. </p></p>",

Like Arya (and most women), I have struggled my whole life with not perfectly fitting the mold of a\u00a0\u201clady\u201d. I do have some traditionally \u201cfeminine\u201d characteristics: I\u2019m empathetic, emotional, compassionate, motherly, I love fiercely&ndash;qualities that Arya also possesses. But I have never been very\u00a0\u201cladylike\u201d: I\u2019m loud, stubborn, opinionated, independent, vulgar, snarky and sarcastic, messy, wild, occasionally violent, a good leader. I refuse to be pigeonholed into traditional gender roles or remain silent in the face of injustice. I saw all of these traits reflected back at me the more I got to know Arya, and it\u2019s what made me love her all the more.</p><p>Like Arya, being \u201cunladylike\u201d has been one of the primary sources of criticism (and sometimes ridicule) I have experienced throughout my life. So when I first read this quote many years ago:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m not a lady</i>, she wanted to tell her, <i>I\u2019m a wolf</i>\u201d - <i>ASOS, </i>Arya IV</p></blockquote><p>it became a sort of shield for me.

I have learned that hiding behind this \u201cI\u2019m not a lady\u201d shield is not the best way to navigate complex issues of gender and patriarchy, because it reinforces the very misogynistic notion that femininity is a weakness or something to be ashamed of. I have also learned that claiming to be \u201cnot like other girls\u201d is bullshit; it implies that women are a generalized monolith instead of complex individuals, that we have to compete with and separate ourselves from each other in order to be of any value (it\u2019s also incredibly insulting to women; who are these \u201cother girls\u201d and why do you feel the need to put them down to make yourself feel better?). Instead, I have come to embrace the feminine and the wild in me. I wear dresses (because they\u2019re so goddamned comfortable), I love pretty shoes, I show my softer side more, I strive to be kind and and gentle and encourage others to express their emotions, I crave love and romance and am not ashamed of it. But I\u2019m by no means a traditional\u00a0\u201clady,\u201d either; I curse like a sailor, I\u2019m still loud, I\u2019m authoritative, I stand my ground, and I certainly don\u2019t cross my legs on the subway to give a man more room (spread\u00a0\u2018em wide, ladies&ndash;let them know how it feels to be forced to shrink yourself because someone else feels entitled to your personal space).

I do have some traditionally &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; characteristics: I&rsquo;m empathetic, emotional, compassionate, motherly, I love fiercely&ndash;qualities that Arya also possesses. But I have never been very&nbsp;&ldquo;ladylike&rdquo;: I&rsquo;m loud, stubborn, opinionated, independent, vulgar, snarky and sarcastic, messy, wild, occasionally violent, a good leader. I refuse to be pigeonholed into traditional gender roles or remain silent in the face of injustice. I saw all of these traits reflected back at me the more I got to know Arya, and it&rsquo;s what made me love her all the more.</p><p>Like Arya, being &ldquo;unladylike&rdquo; has been one of the primary sources of criticism (and sometimes ridicule) I have experienced throughout my life. So when I first read this quote many years ago:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m not a lady</i>, she wanted to tell her, <i>I&rsquo;m a wolf</i>&rdquo; - <i>ASOS, </i>Arya IV</p></blockquote><p>it became a sort of shield for me. Whenever I was accused of&nbsp;&ldquo;unladylike&rdquo; behavior, this would be my response. It was an act of defiance&ndash;it was me saying&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to be feminine to be powerful. I don&rsquo;t have to be like other girls to have value.&rdquo; It helped restore a sense of pride in myself and made me feel better about not fitting the mold others tried to force me into.</p><p>The more I&rsquo;ve grown, though, the more comfortable I have become in my own skin. I have learned that hiding behind this &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a lady&rdquo; shield is not the best way to navigate complex issues of gender and patriarchy, because it reinforces the very misogynistic notion that femininity is a weakness or something to be ashamed of. I have also learned that claiming to be &ldquo;not like other girls&rdquo; is bullshit; it implies that women are a generalized monolith instead of complex individuals, that we have to compete with and separate ourselves from each other in order to be of any value (it&rsquo;s also incredibly insulting to women; who are these &ldquo;other girls&rdquo; and why do you feel the need to put them down to make yourself feel better?). Instead, I have come to embrace the feminine and the wild in me. I wear dresses (because they&rsquo;re so goddamned comfortable), I love pretty shoes, I show my softer side more, I strive to be kind and and gentle and encourage others to express their emotions, I crave love and romance and am not ashamed of it. But I&rsquo;m by no means a traditional&nbsp;&ldquo;lady,&rdquo; either; I curse like a sailor, I&rsquo;m still loud, I&rsquo;m authoritative, I stand my ground, and I certainly don&rsquo;t cross my legs on the subway to give a man more room (spread&nbsp;&lsquo;em wide, ladies&ndash;let them know how it feels to be forced to shrink yourself because someone else feels entitled to your personal space). I have discovered that I get to decide what kind of woman I want to be and that I should help other women discover that for themselves, too.</p><p>This is the kind of growth I want for Arya. I want her to redefine what it means to be a lady. I want her to be the leader that she&rsquo;s always dreamed of being and to help make the world better for younger generations of women (because that&rsquo;s true feminism&ndash;sticking around and putting in the hard work to make the world a more just and equal place. Going off alone to explore and never coming back because&nbsp;&ldquo;yay independent woman!!!&rdquo; is what the kids call &ldquo;fake woke&rdquo;). I want her to find the love and family and stability&ndash;the pack&ndash;she so desperately craves.\n\n I want her to learn that despite her years of bullying, she does not need to feel ashamed of being&nbsp;&ldquo;unladylike&rdquo;&ndash;that those traits combined with her more &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; qualities (devotion to family, compassion for the common people, emotional nature, etc. etc.) are what make her such a great leader and an even better person. I want her to realize that she doesn&rsquo;t need to change herself to be loved because those who care about her the most love her for exactly who she is and wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing. I want her to embrace herself in all of her contradictions, to realize that she does not have to choose between badass fighter and family, independence and romance, adventure and leadership. I want her to learn that this lady vs warrior dichotomy that society (and d&amp;d) push on her is bullshit&ndash;that she can break the mold and carve out a unique path for herself and she doesn&rsquo;t have to be alone to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a lady, I&rsquo;m a wolf&rdquo; will always be an important phrase for me because of what it helped me overcome. It&rsquo;s a pivotal part of Arya&rsquo;s journey and mine. But I&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s not who I am nor is it who I want Arya to be. I want her to realize that she can be a lady <i>and </i>a wolf, just like I did.&nbsp;<br /></p>",
