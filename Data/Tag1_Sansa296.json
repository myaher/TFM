I know some people compare her to Sansa Stark with her ignorance and innocence of the world until harshly confronted with it but Lucy didn't grow up in a castle with parents who sheltered her from the world. I think Lucy might have been sheltered a little, but you'd think Margaret and especially Charlotte would prepare her for being a courtesan. Plus her arrogance is absolutely irritating.",
        "answer": "<p>When people compare Sansa and Lucy, it\u2019s not <i>just</i> that they \nboth were sheltered (and yes \u2014 Lucy may not have had as cosseted an \nupbringing as Sansa, but she really was sheltered as much as Mags was \nable) and then had traumatic experiences that disillusioned them about \nthe life they\u2019d grown up idealizing. The more significant part of the \ncomparison, imo, is how fandom audiences <i>respond</i> to such \ncharacters. Far too many people seem to have no sympathy or patience \nwhatsoever for dutiful, naive, conventionally feminine teenage girls who\n react to their horrible circumstances in ways that are too complicated,\n too ugly, or simply not how they \u201cshould\u201d have reacted. Broad segments \nof the fandoms hold both Sansa and Lucy to a flawless standard of \nbehavior not expected of their brasher, \u201ccooler,\u201d more worldly sisters, \nand because some people refuse to put themselves in their shoes, there\u2019s\n very little tolerance for their mistakes.<br/></p><p>I\u2019m not saying that\n that\u2019s how YOU treat either of them.

There\u2019s a big difference between growing up in a well-run brothel \nand listening to the experienced girls laugh and gossip about culls who \nseem kinda ridiculous but fairly ordinary and usually harmless\u2026 versus\n men who degrade and insult and force you (like Howard) or terrorize and\n beat you (like Repton) or force fruit into your mouth while saying \nthings that make you confused and afraid (like Fallon). And instead of \nasking for help, Lucy bottles up her fear and her pain because SO much is riding on her for the move to Greek Street. She wants\n SO badly to help her family and make her mother proud. Even in season \n2, a lot of the mistakes she makes re: Fallon go back to the fact that \nshe\u2019s still a young girl trying so hard to be Very Grown Up, precisely <i>because</i> she knows how hard life is and <i>wants</i>\n to prove herself. She bottles things up because she\u2019s trying to be \nstrong and independent and reliable, and sometimes, eventually, disastrously, the \nbottle explodes.<br/></p><p>And sure: Lucy is far from the only character\n on Harlots to experience sexual trauma.

That, I think, is part of why her \nreactions can seem messier and more violent and sometimes terribly \nmisguided. Regardless, we shouldn\u2019t downplay one character\u2019s trauma by \ncomparing it to another\u2019s anyway, or criticize Lucy because other \ncharacters appear to be \u201chandling\u201d it better than her.<br/></p><p>I know it can be frustrating to watch Lucy make bad choices, and I\u2019m not trying to tell you that you have to <i>like</i>\n her.

It\u2019s weird, but so\u2019s my brain!</b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://dialux.tumblr.com/tagged/a-tempest%3B-a-cyclone\" target=\"_blank\">Previous chapters can be found here.</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Four: she wears fire for skin but a storm lives in her soul</b><br/></p><p>Snow is seeping into Sansa\u2019s clothes. </p><p>She refuses to move, however, and even less to give away her position. There can be no mistakes made now: Sansa <i>must</i> succeed, for the price of failure is too great to contemplate, much less allow.</p><p>Lady- Sansa can sense her, vaguely, off behind the small bush she\u2019s hidden behind. She\u2019d yipped some time previous, but the silence now makes her feel wary. Their prey approaches, and Sansa must be fast enough to strike, quick enough to do so without letting him attack her in return.</p><p>And then she hears, distantly, the snap of a twig.</p><p>Dark Sister is perfectly balanced in one hand. Sansa shifts her weight from one leg to another, then back, ensuring she\u2019s ready to jump out. She breathes in, slowly, and Ghost bounds into the clearing.</p><p>Not a few minutes later, so does Jon.</p><p>Her breath catches.</p><p>He\u2019s older than she remembers; his hair is raggeder, and there\u2019s a stiffness to his shoulders that Sansa hasn\u2019t seen before. If anything, Jon\u2019s grown to look even more like their father.</p><p><i>My father. </i>The truth tastes like ashes in her mouth. <i>Jon\u2019s uncle.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat was so important, boy?\u201d Jon demands of Ghost, pressing his hands to his knees and panting. \u201cThat you had to-\u201d he straightens, abruptly, and half-draws his sword out of the scabbard, turning to the shadows exactly opposite to Sansa, from which a soft noise has come. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s there\u2026\u201d His voice sounds menacing. </p><p>Lady pads out of the darkness, and Sansa makes full use of Jon\u2019s momentary distraction to start moving forwards.</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d asks Jon, almost reaching out to touch her. \u201cYou survived? I didn\u2019t-\u201d he swallows, hard. \u201cI thought you\u2019d died.\u201d</p><p>She should keep silent, according to the very plan that she\u2019d hashed out last night- hit Jon over the head, and let him wake up after that, bound so he\u2019s forced to listen to her words. But seeing the way Jon\u2019s hands tremble, as if a strong wind had blown between the spaces of his fingers- Sansa cannot. The weight of a hundred worlds could have borne down on her \u00a0tongue, and it would not have mattered.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d says Sansa, softly. He goes stiff about the shoulders. \u201cAnd neither did I.\u201d</p><p>Jon whirls around, and Sansa has all of a heartbeat to realize that he\u2019s not been calmed by seeing Lady; he\u2019s palmed a knife instead, one that he uses to slash at Sansa\u2019s arm. She stumbles back, sleeve ripping, and Jon uses the moment to draw his sword.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d he asks, eyes narrowing on her.</p><p>Sansa smiles tremulously. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to talk, you\u2019ll drop that sword.\u201d He doesn\u2019t soften, not even a little, and Sansa feels her heart stumble a little. Her mother, her father- they wouldn\u2019t have recognized her, would they? She\u2019s changed so much that-</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says, struggling to keep her voice even, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you think-\u201d</p><p>Her words are cut off when Jon releases a flurry of blows at her, half of which she catches as a matter of habit and the other half of which she deflects by sheer chance. His hands tighten further on his sword\u2019s hilt and Sansa takes two large steps backwards, her lungs aching.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>Sansa,\u201d</i> she snaps breathlessly. \u201cYou absolute moron, it\u2019s <i>me,</i> stop fighting-\u201d</p><p>Jon laughs. Then he says, \u201cMy sister\u2019s in King\u2019s Landing. If you want to lie to me, try to do better than that.\u201d</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this. Listen to me, you utter buffoon!</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d says Sansa, fright and irritation melding together into a strange amalgam in her chest to produce an even stranger voice. \u201cListen, I need you to <i>listen-\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d replies Jon, and spins neatly to catch her across her underarm. </p><!-- more --><p>Sansa ducks away, a shriek caught in her throat.</p><p>(Sansa\u2019s always prepared. </p><p>This is one thing that everyone seems to forget about her: she\u2019s never had as native a skill at sewing as everyone seems to assume, but once she realized how important it was for ladies- Sansa\u2019d spent nights and mornings and every spare moment of her time sawing that needle through the cloth until it resembled the primers they\u2019d been given. </p><p>Everyone always forgets that. </p><p>Jon Snow is not an exception.)</p><p>(Now, here\u2019s a tale that hasn\u2019t been told:</p><p>When Sansa forgave Elia, there was a scrap of silver that Elia let fall into the sand, far below them both. Elia, Elia, Elia Martell: of Nymeria and Mors, daughter of Arianne, with the sun\u2019s sparks sunk deep into her bones. That silver that fell- it burned and blistered the sand, and when Sansa ran over it hours later it remained hot to the touch, blazing even through the soles of her sandals.</p><p>Sansa wrapped it up in cloth soaked in saltwater and remembered grief, and took it with her North.)</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Sansa ducks away, a shriek building in her throat, and when Jon finishes the spin, turning to meet her, she throws one fistful of sand-embers straight into his face. He backs away, clawing at his eyes. She doesn\u2019t hesitate at that- if there\u2019s one thing she\u2019s learned from Visenya it\u2019s <i>do not pause.</i> Not for pain, not for love, not once you\u2019ve set upon a course. </p><p>With all the grace of a barreling ox, Sansa brings Dark Sister\u2019s hilt down on the side of Jon\u2019s head.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>She goes to get some of the melted snow from her camp, a ways away from where she\u2019d decided to confront Jon. There\u2019s little chance of Jon escaping, but Sansa\u2019s bound his hands and removed both his sword and the visible daggers anyhow. Lugging the water back leaves red marks along her palms- Sansa grits her teeth and bears through the pain.</p><p>He\u2019s awake and half-escaped the ropes Sansa\u2019d tied him up with when she returns.</p><p>\u201cGods <i>above,\u201d</i> Sansa says, driving the bucket into the snow with one sharp motion. \u201cIf you continue to do that, I\u2019ll- I\u2019ll dump this water on you, see if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jon freezes, before slowly relaxing. \u201cThis is a dream,\u201d he mutters to himself. The confusion on his face softens Sansa\u2019s ire, just enough for her to seat herself in front of him. </p><p>\u201cYou dream of me often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is why this is so- surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d He looks up at the tone of her voice, at the abrupt intensity. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream. There are things I must tell you- necessary things. Dangerous things. Important things. You have to <i>listen,</i> not run away, not ignore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is so important?\u201d asks Jon, lifting one brow. </p><p>\u201cTo start out with-\u201d Sansa shifts uneasily, \u201c-you\u2019re in danger. People want to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Her hand spasms around her knee. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugs his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been in danger ever since I left Winterfell. I don\u2019t need any apparition from the gods to remind me of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>not </i>an apparition from any god!\u201d Sansa springs to her feet, the surge of emotion in her belly making it impossible to remain seated. </p><p>She sucks on her teeth in a vain attempt to stop looking at the melted water. It\u2019s supposed to be used to wash the mud from her hair and prove, finally, unequivocally, that she is who she says she is. But it would feel so good to just throw it on Jon and his stupid, stubborn face.</p><p>\u201cGive me one good reason, then,\u201d says Jon, \u201cwhy Sansa Stark would be here at the Wall. Start with how- how she left King\u2019s Landing, and then with how she survived the trek all the way here, and then with how she came to have- is that <i>mud</i> on your hair?- short hair, and- and a fucking sword!\u201d He pauses, breathing heavily, before continuing even louder: \u201cA sword! That she knows how to use! You tell me who\u2019d have taught her, and then how she got Ghost to bring me out of the castle, and why, out of all the bloody castles in all the world, she\u2019d choose this one! Answer that and <i>yes,</i> then I might believe you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t look like her?\u201d Sansa asks. She\u2019s aiming for levity, but it falls flat; it sounds too strained, and she has to hide her flinch at both the wound she\u2019s revealed as well as the thin sound of her voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Jon, scornfully. \u201cIf she ever dressed up as an urchin it\u2019d not last longer than one afternoon. The mud would be too much for Sansa, I think, more than even the hunger.\u201d</p><p><i>What a terrible thing, </i>Sansa thinks distantly, <i>to hear the truth.</i></p><p>But she has her pride, now, along with her love and fear and anger. So she only lifts her chin and smiles and makes sure- with enough ferocity to make even a Targaryen quail- that the smile doesn\u2019t wobble.</p><p>\u201cI left King\u2019s Landing through the kitchens.\u201d One breath to keep her voice even, and a second to keep her eyes level, and the third is for no reason other than that she wants it. \u201cI cut my hair and burned it before I left. It wasn\u2019t so difficult, in all honesty: nobody expected that I\u2019d escape on my own, and less that I\u2019d escape disguised as a boy.\u201d <i>Not even you, brother mine.</i> \u201cI stole some food, and some clothes, but not from people who couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. That comes to who taught me, and you\u2019d not believe that if you don\u2019t believe the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>Jon leans forwards. \u201cLet\u2019s say I believe you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon-\u201d Sansa says, slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me the story.\u201d His eyes are glittering, hard and unyielding. This is not the brother Sansa knows; this is the Lord Commander that the Night\u2019s Watch has elected. \u201cSo tell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s name is Dark Sister.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment\u2019s pause, and then Jon realizes where he\u2019s heard that name. His eyes dip to the sword, and then rise to meet hers, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cMade of Valyrian steel,\u201d Sansa continues, when he keeps silent. \u201cIts first owner gave it to me. And she was the one to teach me swordfighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first owner was-\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisenya.\u201d She inclines her head. \u201cOf House Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s jaw is slack. He keeps staring at the sword and then back to her. After a moment- he hisses out through his teeth, a sound so derisive it catches in her chest.</p><p>\u201cI can see ghosts,\u201d Sansa tells him, the syllables stretching out her throat, thick and glutinous. \u201cEver since I was three namedays old- I\u2019ve been able to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had strange dreams,\u201d Jon mumbles, \u201cbut never<i> this</i> strange.\u201d</p><p>And, abruptly, the frustration fades, replaced instead by exhaustion. \u201cI would be much happier if it were truly a jape,\u201d Sansa says flatly. \u201cOr a dream, or anything but the truth. But it is not. I have lived with this secret for more than a decade, Jon. And I left the Red Keep, I left Riverrun, I left <i>Winterfell-</i> more than a dozen castles I\u2019ve passed, each one happier than the other to house me and protect me, and I\u2019ve left it all behind to come here.\u201d <i>I\u2019ve left behind more than that, as well.</i> \u201cYou can keep thinking it\u2019s a dream if you want, but you\u2019ll have to help me nevertheless.\u201d</p><p>He tips his head to the side. \u201cHelp- how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a gate.\u201d Sansa reaches forwards, to the hands that Jon\u2019s unbound- if she had nails they might have dug into his skin, but she\u2019s bitten them to the quick instead- and looks into his eyes, dark and honest and sharp as her father\u2019s. <i>I don\u2019t trust anyone,</i> she thinks fiercely, but Jon\u2019s hands are warm and alive and she can\u2019t keep herself from gripping them too tightly. \u201cIn Castle Black. You have to get me through it, to the other side of the Wall.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>When Jon goes to pick up the keys, Willam appears to her once more. Sansa sighs and seats herself, quietly, wishing her hair were longer- braiding it would give her something to do with her hands. She feels strained and worn instead. Like licorice pulled thin enough that it was transparent.</p><p>Her parents don\u2019t know where she is. Her brother didn\u2019t recognize her, and doesn\u2019t trust her even when she tells him the truth. Sansa Stark, for all that she is alive, might as well not exist. </p><p><i>Does it matter where a person is,</i> she wants to ask Willam- wants to ask Lyarra, wants to ask Minisa-<i> if there is no one else in all the world who knows where they are? </i></p><p>She doesn\u2019t. She leans back and shrugs under Willam\u2019s piercing stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asks Sansa, in the place of all the other things on the tip of her tongue. \u201cI got him to do what needed to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks you some creature borne out of the old tales,\u201d Willam responds. \u201cSome prophet, perhaps, or a Child. Anything but his sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-because it is so unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause-\u201d and here, Willam\u2019s tone gentles, just a little, \u201c-you are showing him sides of yourself you have kept shrouded in darkness all your life. It is as if a glass merchant spent all his life selling glass, and then shifted to selling diamond. Will there not be people who come to you, expecting glass wares? Will they not be surprised, startled, when that is not offered to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConstancy is comfort,\u201d Sansa says, quietly.</p><p>Willam smiles at her. \u201cJust so. Change is difficult for people to accept. You should not have approached him as an adversary in the beginning.\u201d He shifts, and shines like snow in the pale sunlight. \u201cYou will have to change that, later. It will be more difficult now.\u201d</p><p><i>It is the truth. Shall you turn from it?</i></p><p>Months ago, Sansa had sat in the Red Keep and looked at her grandfather, and she\u2019d thought, <i>yes.</i></p><p><i>No,</i> she thinks now, and she doesn\u2019t know what has changed, knows only that there is cold in her lungs and ice along her scalp and she has stiffened with it instead of freezing alive, knows only that she is stronger within her family\u2019s lands for reasons she cannot explain to anyone, reasons that still exist. <i>No, I will not turn away. I will face the worst fears. I swear it.</i></p><p>\u201cMy grandfather,\u201d she says, mouth dry. She doesn\u2019t want to continue talking about truths that ache like this. \u201cWhen I was in the Red Keep, he told me that there was one secret that ought to be told, one secret that wasn\u2019t his place to tell me. He told me to tell Lyarra.\u201d <i>But I don\u2019t trust Lyarra. She\u2019s not telling me everything.</i> \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>Willam looks a little paler at her words. \u201cLyarra told me that Rickard\u2019s told you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything but the first secret.\u201d That had been what Rickard called it, once, casually thrown into their conversations those last few weeks. \u201cThe one that began the Stark line.\u201d</p><p>Again, there\u2019s hesitation. Slowly, Willam nods; and then he says, softly, \u201c It is the first secret, and always the last told. Brandon the Builder forbade his sons from ever speaking it, and Brandon the Breaker did the same, but the knowledge has lasted nevertheless.\u201d He frowns. \u201cI never understood it, truth be told- perhaps it shall make more sense to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a daughter.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, Sansa realizes that it\u2019s it; those four words are the secret that Rickard knew, that last bit of Stark knowledge that has been whispered for years, from heir to lord to heir again. She wants to claw at her skin, just a little, with sheer frustration.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d she says, quietly. \u201cWho had a daughter? Why was she- why is she so important? That knowledge of her remains past years and years of loss?\u201d </p><p>Willam smiles at her sadly. \u201c\u2018Tis a mark of growth, to ask questions that your elders cannot answer. Perhaps you shall solve this secret, little daughter. A thing to put your name to, when this is all over.\u201d</p><p><i>If I do as Lyarra wishes,</i> Sansa thinks, ugliness lining her throat, terror and desire hot in her gut, <i>I will put my name on this entire world.</i></p><p><i>They will never forget </i>me,<i> not after all I have lost.</i></p><p>The air is cold and her gloves are thin and her eyes itch. Sansa feels the wind along her thin, thin hair and she imagines a sweep of red down her back, long and beautiful as a hawk\u2019s wings. She is exhausted, bitter, alone. She has never felt fiercer than she has in that moment, the wind billowing her from the back, sunlight shining on that skin, alive against all odds.</p><p><i>If I cannot be happy, then I will be remembered.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>Sansa does, eventually, wash the mud from her hair, but it does little to lessen the suspicion on his face. Even with Lady obeying her commands, docile as a dog, he doesn\u2019t think she is- Sansa Stark- Jon seems to think she\u2019s something else altogether, and not a benign entity at that.</p><p>But he smuggles her through the castle quietly; and when they reach the tunnel, Jon doesn\u2019t hesitate to plunge into the darkness.</p><p>For a long moment, Sansa hesitates. Then she starts walking, Lady and Ghost keeping time behind her. They pause at one of the iron gates as Jon fumbles at the lock with a key. When the tunnel doesn\u2019t lighten at all, she coughs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s- how many gates are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d Jon answers brusquely. \u201cTwo more.\u201d</p><p><i>Three. </i>Sansa can feel her palms growing clammy, but she doesn\u2019t dare loosen her grip on Dark Sister\u2019s hilt to wipe it. In two more gates, she has to be ready to\u2026 <i>It isn\u2019t kidnapping. It\u2019s saving a life.</i></p><p>And she has both Ghost and Lady on her side. </p><p>One more gate, then the last one. </p><p>Jon slides the key in, shoulders the slatted steel through, and Sansa emerges into the cold winter light of the world beyond the Wall. His eyes- dark and wary- are fixed on her, not on the snows around them. Sansa feels the pull of that beauty, the desire to see that and admire it, but she puts it aside to focus on her brother.</p><p><i>I will not let you die, </i>she thinks, and smiles thinly at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jon relaxes just a little at her words, but Sansa\u2019s not done, not close. She steps forwards and catches his hand. \u201cCome with me,\u201d she whispers. \u201cYour life isn\u2019t safe here, Jon. Even if they don\u2019t do something immediately- people are trying to kill you, and it is always easier to take a life than it is to keep one. And\u2026 and it will be better if you were with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have sworn vows,\u201d Jon replies, but it\u2019s gentler than he\u2019s sounded in some time. \u201cI have no choice.\u201d</p><p>Sansa steps away. The leather of her boots feels like it might creak- it is so old, and her feet are curling with her impatience- but this must be done properly. She hasn\u2019t felt this regretful of something in a long time; even when she left Riverrun, the only pain she bartered with was her own. Now, it is Jon\u2019s she is toying with. His pain, his honor, his life.</p><p>If her stay in the south has taught her anything, it is that honor is worth only that value that the person places in it; and that a little pain is preferable to the loss of a life. <i>This is necessary,</i> she reminds herself. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Sansa responds, and sees how he softens further at her tone. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about that, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish-\u201d he breaks off the words abruptly, shaking his head. \u201cGoodbye, then. The debt I owed you for losing to the duel is through. Good travels to you, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never loved you as I ought,\u201d Sansa muses, letting one hand fall open to her side. The direwolves are far more intelligent than many people assume, which is to their detriment. But Sansa hadn\u2019t ever thought that even Jon would ignore Ghost\u2019s intellect, which is far beyond that of any common wolf\u2019s or other pet. When she\u2019d explained, the previous night, to him, Ghost had understood her. Sansa\u2019s sure of it. \u201cBut that does not mean I would be glad to see you dead. And if, at the end of all of this, you\u2019d like to go back- I would not stop you. But only after Father has come and taken care of these men who wish to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d says Sansa, before Ghost leaps at Jon and bears him down to the ground, before Lady gnaws through Jon\u2019s scabbard and divests him of half his weaponry, \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>While he\u2019s still disoriented, Sansa tosses the keys he\u2019d used to unlock the gates past the first one and then cuts the weight holding the winching gears back. Jon goes rigid when he hears the thunk of the heavy steel door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you-\u201d he spits, when he gets Lady\u2019s tail whipping straight into his face, \u201c-what- what\u2019re you <i>do-\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving your life,\u201d Sansa replies, evenly. </p><p>She belts his scabbard over her own waist. It settles easily enough, but is too tight for a second loop and too loose for just one. After a shrug, she slides it over her head so it rests at a diagonal: one part of the strap at her shoulder, another at her hip. It digs into her skin, but it\u2019s the best compromise she currently has.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jon hisses. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to-\u201d One of the direwolves barrels into him; Jon grunts and stumbles forwards. \u201cOur deal is <i>finished.</i> You cannot demand more of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a deal,\u201d Sansa says. \u201cI never thought of it as one. This is not a debt you are paying me, nor a deal we struck with swords in the woods.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen what is this?\u201d he demands. </p><p>She thinks of Willam, sitting beside her, silvered and shining. She thinks of his words: <i>There are debts between people, yes, often, but the world is not all of that. There is love as well.</i> She swallows. \u201cCall it whatever you want. But I am your sister, and I will not let you die for the foolishness of your pride.\u201d</p><p>He bristles. \u201cMy honor is-\u201d</p><p>Sansa reaches forwards and catches his hand, blindly, because she\u2019s looking into his eyes, because she knows Jon will believe this, even if he doesn\u2019t believe that she is real.</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d she says. \u201cThe dead are coming, and I can defeat them, and I ca- I <i>will-</i> do it alone but- could you live with yourself?\u201d Jon stares at her. \u201cIf I defeated them and you could have been beside me but weren\u2019t, because you were afraid?\u201d Sansa remembers Lyarra\u2019s cold, cold hands on the back of her neck, the chill that\u2019s offered her more comfort than almost anything else in her life. \u201cThey say that Bran and Rickon are alive, Jon. That they\u2019re beyond the Wall, and alive, and safe.\u201d A moment to catch her breath, and then she adds the last sentence, soft and gentle and all-shaking as an avalanche. \u201cHonor is important, yes, but the world is more important than one man\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>Jon tears his hands away from her and stumbles away. \u201cThese are vows I\u2019ve sworn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are people relying on me.\u201d</p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t move. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather would want me to honor what I\u2019ve sworn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather would want you to honor your duties to your family,\u201d Sansa says, harsher than she\u2019d expected the words to sound. The lie still tastes bitter on her tongue: <i>father, father, father.</i> \u201cAnd I swear to you, your familial duties lie here, not behind that Wall.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, not for very long at all; Jon bows his head and Sansa presses her hands together to keep from picking at her nails. Then he lifts his head and-</p><p>And he looks like an old, old hero, from one of those old tales. Not a Targaryen knight. Not a King of Winter. There\u2019s a tapestry hidden beside one of the crypts that Torrhen had shown her, once, parchment-thin and crumbly as old leaf, with a man\u2019s profile sketched in large, broad swathes. </p><p>It\u2019s faded. </p><p>It\u2019s glorious.</p><p>That\u2019s what Jon looks like, Sansa thinks. Old worries on a young face, beauty on bones that weren\u2019t built to carry them, strength dug up out of salt and snow and somehow still rooted deep. She wants to shrink away from the depths of the emotions she feels upon seeing his face; she wants to reach out and embrace it, let it burn her until she is nothing but ashes.</p><p><i>Targaryen,</i> a voice breathes into her ear, and she realizes- Visenya. He is Visenya, but younger, but tempered, but more loved than Visenya has ever known in centuries of either life or death. <i>Stark,</i> too, as Stark as Arya, who\u2019d been loved and adored for all she\u2019d never obeyed anyone\u2019s orders, but brighter, but uglier.</p><p>\u201cGive me my sword,\u201d says Jon, and the spell shatters as if someone had struck it with a hammer. </p><p>Sansa shudders back to life. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, a little numbly. \u201cYes, I will- do that.\u201d</p><p><i>Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. </i>She cannot breathe for the weight of the lies, none of them hers. There are tears in her eyes, and Sansa bites them back until her throat aches. <i>You have brought something into this world that is more terrible than you could have ever thought.</i></p><p>Jon hesitates, and then he firms his shoulders. \u201cWhich direction are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They walk for hours.</p><p>It is strange, to be with someone whose needs must be met- Sansa has gotten used to the dead, who are tireless and limited only by the boundaries they can cross. But Jon must eat and drink and sleep, so they trade watches, and divide the food as evenly as they can. </p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t realize that Jon doesn\u2019t believe her. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t, though- not until almost a sennight after they set out.</p><p>They\u2019re pitching their camp, and Sansa\u2019s stirring the fire with a knobbly stick while Jon returns with enough wood to keep the fire going through the night. There\u2019s dried berries and the remains of a snow hare for dinner; Sansa feels nausea dig into her, so she hums a little ditty to herself. </p><p>It isn\u2019t much. Just a little girl\u2019s rendition of the sea shanties that Theon Stark had taught her, which were two octaves lower than her own voice. Barely audible, even to herself.</p><p>Jon, across the camp, hearing her over the crackle of the fire, stills. He mumbles something into the wood.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d asks Sansa.</p><p>He turns to her. And Jon\u2019s eyes- Sansa hasn\u2019t ever seen them like that before, liquid-bright and hot with something that could have been either horror or ecstasy. \u201cDo that again,\u201d he whispers, \u201cthat- song. The humming.\u201d</p><p>One up, three down, each note sharper than any sea shanty would ever be, but carrying its same rhythm. Sansa eyes Jon suspiciously but sings nevertheless.</p><p>Jon\u2019s face can\u2019t seem to decide what it feels. He pales further, until he looks like a half-ghost. Then he says, \u201cSa-\u201d his voice breaks, picking up momentum a breath later, \u201cSansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She flattens her hands on the fabric covering her knees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought- I\u2019d forgotten that- oh, gods.\u201d He sits down on the ground, right there, looking sick and joyous all at once. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sansa says slowly. \u201cI am myself. Is something the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t-\u201d Jon looks as white as a ghost. \u201cI thought you were some- something else. A- a story Old Nan hadn\u2019t remembered to tell us.\u201d</p><p>Sansa lifts an eyebrow. \u201cAnd that was more believable to you than me being myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t-\u201d he gestures violently, before reaching up to scrub through his hair. \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to <i>be</i> like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty.\u201d His eyes narrow on her, and Sansa feels her amusement rise to match his annoyance. \u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>She keeps her face as blank as she can make it, though her lips certainly twitch. \u201cBeing trained by a woman who conquered an entire continent has the ability to change a lot of things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou were not trained by Visenya Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas so.\u201d Sansa leans back, eyes wide and innocent. \u201cDid you know that she hates our grandfather?\u201d</p><p>Jon sputters. \u201cYou did <i>not</i> speak to our grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a tall man.\u201d She gnaws on the inside of her cheek to still her smile, though she can\u2019t quite hide it entirely. \u201cGrumpy, too. I see where you get it from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d he sighs.</p><p><i>\u201cJon,\u201d</i> she mimics, before dropping the amusement. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult to imagine. But you\u2019ve seen the dead- the actual <i>dead-</i> and the Night\u2019s King. Do you think me being able to see ghosts is so very different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says plainly. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to think the old stories are true. It\u2019s another to think that my sister\u2019s been lying to me for her entire life. Lying to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Sansa folds her hands over her lap. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because that would have gone over so well with Mother and Father,\u201d Sansa says flatly. \u201cOh, yes, I\u2019ve sown all the samplers you want, Mother, I\u2019ve done the letters you want, Father, and, by the way, I had a <i>fascinating</i> conversation with Torrhen Stark on how his daughter planted the first blue roses in Winterfell, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t fall asleep the way Arya did this afternoon!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s shouting by the end. Her eyes burn, just a little, but she pushes it away in favor of gripping her wrists tightly.</p><p>\u201cFather would have-\u201d Jon exhales, whistling it out through his teeth, \u201c-I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d have done, because this is- this is- so strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you understand,\u201d Sansa says.</p><p>Jon moves closer to her, slowly, hesitantly- he raises his hand as if he means to draw her into an embrace, and then he drops it to cuff her shoulder instead. \u201cI know that they love you. Your mother might not have\u2026\u201d he trails off, awkwardly, before settling against the log, back against her shins. \u201cLiked me, all that much. But she\u2019s always loved you, all of you. Arya at her brattiest. Robb at his angriest. You remember how much she yelled at Bran?\u201d</p><p>For weeks on end. Sansa remembers: her mother rigid with anger and worry, Bran limber and long-limbed. Every morning for two years, they\u2019d been woken by Catelyn yelling at Bran for climbing; so much it had become a routine, and still Bran had never thought she didn\u2019t love him. </p><p>Even in King\u2019s Landing- nobody, not a single soul, had ever doubted in Catelyn Stark\u2019s love for her children. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Sansa, soundless.</p><p>\u201cWe would have understood.\u201d He huffs a laugh. \u201cOr tried. We would have tried our best, at the least.\u201d</p><p>Sansa curls over her hands, hunching against the cold. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>I don\u2019t trust you, </i>thinks Sansa, hands cold, heart colder. <i>I don\u2019t believe you.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHow did you realize it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose songs. Nobody else ever liked them enough to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew I was myself because I sang a sea shanty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were yourself because nobody else could have sung it that badly.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cJon!\u201d</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>A week later, Sansa wakes to find a third wolf in their midst.</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d breathes Jon. </p><p>Sansa snaps her head towards him. \u201cThey\u2019re alive. Bran and Rickon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe them?\u201d Jon asks. \u201cYour ghosts-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t certain.\u201d She runs her fingers down Summer\u2019s dark fur. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be certain. There\u2019s been so many lies, you know- secrets, forgotten truths- I haven\u2019t trusted anyone. In a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for me,\u201d says Jon.</p><p>Then he seems to understand what Sansa\u2019s averted face means: Jon flinches as if she\u2019s struck him, and he steps forwards to look at her closer. </p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d he says.</p><p>She tilts her head up to meet his gaze. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s fault,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I <i>can,</i> anymore. Or if I ever could. I never really even considered telling anyone about how I could see ghosts, and that was before Rickard and Visenya\u2026 drove that point home.\u201d</p><p>Jon looks horrified for a long minute, but then he scoffs- scoffs and drops to sit next to her, looking vaguely irritated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cTrust isn\u2019t something that\u2019s- that\u2019s like hair color, or your height, or anything like that. It\u2019s not something you\u2019re born with. It- it certainly isn\u2019t your fault, Sansa, if people thought the truth was too dangerous to tell others.\u201d He turns, and eyes- Father\u2019s eyes- pierce through all of Sansa\u2019s shields, leave her open and bare and armorless. \u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault that people gave you secrets to hold.\u201d</p><p><i>This, </i>Sansa thinks contemplatively,<i> is the happiest I\u2019ve felt in years.</i></p><p>She\u2019s hungry, cold, lonely. She\u2019s never even imagined that her family might try to accept her for who she is- never even allowed that hope to materialize. Sansa swallows, and rises to her feet, and when she turns to help Jon to his feet, she pulls him into a hug as well.</p><p>He\u2019s so warm.</p><p>(Sansa\u2019s tears are soft things, born of Minisa and the giving, fertile loam of the Riverlands. But now- her tears are cold, sharp; they burn down her face like ice cracking the earth open. Sansa doesn\u2019t regret the pain at all.</p><p>They\u2019re tears of joy.)</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Summer leads them.</p><p>Sansa can\u2019t find it in herself to breathe, but somehow she manages. Somehow, she keeps herself moving: one foot after the other, one breath in after another, hope and fear swirling in her wake like footprints embedded in snow. </p><p>Bran\u2019s <i>alive,</i> and Sansa\u2019s near him- so close- they\u2019ll be together again.</p><p>Them. Their family. In a snow-ridden wasteland, hurt, so close to being cleaved apart.</p><p>But together.</p><p><i>The pack survives.</i> Sansa keeps walking, Jon beside her, head up as if scenting the wind. They are not wolves, not truly; but right then, Sansa thinks she\u2019ll shred anyone who tries to keep her from Bran to pieces. Right then, she cannot imagine that she is fangless, clawless. <i>I have been alone for too long.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>They emerge, three direwolves and two fur-bundled humans, into the middle of a dark clearing. </p><p>There are numerous people there.</p><p>There is only one person that Sansa cares about. She rises to her toes, straining for a glimpse of-</p><p>\u201cBran,\u201d whispers Sansa, at the shine of his red hair.</p><p>It\u2019s strange: Sansa is the slower of them, between her, and the direwolves, and Jon.</p><p>Perhaps there are wings that grow on her feet. Perhaps the wind aids her. Perhaps it\u2019s love, that gives her the speed to move so quickly. She feels something similar to it, at least: like solid flesh and blood has been replaced, for just a breath, with wind and ice.</p><p>Because she reaches Bran before Jon.</p><p>Bran, who is alive under her arms, who is warm and grown larger than the comatose figure she\u2019d last seen, who is <i>alive,</i> as she hasn\u2019t dreamt possible for months.</p><p>Then Jon is there, and he\u2019s holding onto Bran just as tightly, likely leaving bruises on both of their shoulders- but Sansa doesn\u2019t care. She couldn\u2019t possibly care about anything, not with her brothers beside her, safe and alive and in her arms.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They finally settle in a cave a little distant from the clearing Summer had led them to. It\u2019s large and dark, but dry; and when one of the others lights a match, Sansa realizes that they aren\u2019t wildlings at all. </p><p>Jon starts swearing when he finally sees the same thing. </p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t enemies,\u201d says Bran quietly, when he finally deciphers what both of their sputtering means. \u201cThey\u2019re- they saved my life. We were running, Meera and Jojen and I, and would\u2019ve been caught without Leaf\u2019s help. She brought us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran-\u201d</p><p>Sansa looks at them- the crowd that had allowed Bran to so much as meet them outside, for they\u2019d been the ones to wheel him out, certainly- and tries to pick out what, exactly, is leaving her so unnerved. Perhaps it\u2019s the features, which are so similar to her own and yet alien; perhaps it\u2019s the eyes, which are large and slitted as a cat. Perhaps it\u2019s the grace with which they move, too swift and curving for any human.</p><p>But Sansa\u2019s known ghosts for long enough to push past the initial terror, to search for the ground on which a bond can grow, so she tilts her head back at Bran.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d she asks, just as lowly.</p><p>He nods. </p><p>There\u2019s no hesitation there at all, and it\u2019s that which makes her mind up, more than anything else. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>He jerks his head irritably at her. Sansa ignores him, and gets up, moving slowly towards the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sansa,\u201d she says, when she\u2019s close enough for them to know that she\u2019s addressing them, when it\u2019s unmistakable. \u201cBran\u2019s sister. And this is Jon- he\u2019s our brother. We\u2026 we\u2019re here to help. Jon\u2019s spent years fighting the dead. He\u2019ll be invaluable to you.\u201d</p><p>One of the Children steps forwards slowly. \u201cWe have not the numbers for fighting,\u201d they say, in a voice that rolls over Sansa\u2019s skin like thunder. \u201cAnd less of the will. What use have we for a commander with no forces to command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak not for others,\u201d advises another of the Children, \u201conly for yourself.\u201d</p><p>A third one, with a voice that\u2019s high and sweet, says, \u201cI see you, sister of Bran.\u201d</p><p>Everyone falls silent at that. Behind her, Sansa can hear Bran inhale sharply. But nobody seems willing to elaborate on the statement, not until a child steps out of the crowd. It\u2019s too dark to make out much of their face.</p><p>\u201cYou shine almost as bright as the Crow,\u201d she says slowly, deliberately. \u201cYour brother has the potential to, and it shines as sparks off a stone in his chest. But you? Oh, you shed the light in your wake. His potential is realized in you, all without a weirwood to ground it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Sansa. She watches, numbly, as the child raises one hand to almost brush over her chest.</p><p>Then she feels someone dragging her backwards, and before she can blink, she\u2019s set behind Jon- who\u2019s standing in front of her with his shoulders thrown back, his legs spread as if to take a blow. \u201cStay back,\u201d he growls.</p><p>Bran reaches up and grips Sansa\u2019s wrist, dragging her attention back to him. \u201cShe\u2019s blind,\u201d he whispers. \u201cShe can see magic. Only magic. She\u2019s very old, and-\u201d</p><p>Sansa looks up, and sees the child tilt her head at Jon. Sees her say, \u201cOh, fire and ice. Alone they are common enough, but together? There are things that ought not to be in this world. You are one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d says Bran, and it\u2019s authoritative enough that they all fall silent. Even Jon stops bristling enough to be surprised that he\u2019s listening to Bran; Sansa\u2019s surprised enough, because she remembers how quiet he\u2019d been. Those months of watching Robb lead must have affected him in some manner though, and if this is it, she\u2019ll take it and be glad. \u201cPerhaps we can-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Crow will wish to see her,\u201d says the child. \u201cAnd him, I suppose, if for nothing more than the fire.\u201d</p><p>Bran nods as if her words make sense. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They arrive at a weirwood tree. The hall is well-lit, which is why Sansa can see the man sitting atop a seat made of the weirwood roots- he\u2019s pale and gaunt, save for a patchy rash running from the side of his neck up to his cheekbone. Fine, thin strands of silvery hair are in disarray around him.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Sansa asks carefully.</p><p>He tilts his head to her, but doesn\u2019t speak for a long minute. Sansa wonders if he\u2019s even going to answer- but then he does.</p><p>\u201cI am the three-eyed Crow,\u201d he says, voice hoarse and rasping. It makes Sansa want to shiver out of her skin, the unearthly scrape of it. \u201cBut I was not always this. Perhaps you have heard of a lord named Brynden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynden Waters,\u201d breathes Sansa. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says the man- Brynden, Brynden Waters, the person she\u2019s been charged with meeting by her grandmother and Visenya, two people who\u2019d likely never agree on anything else from this to the end of time. \u201cYou know of me, then.\u201d</p><p>Hands shaking, Sansa undoes her scabbard and removes Dark Sister. </p><p>\u201cYou would know this blade,\u201d she says. </p><p>He laughs. \u201cI would know that blade even if I\u2019d not seen it in half a thousand dreams. How came a Stark by Dark Sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Visenya\u2019s own tutelage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not tutor often,\u201d says Brynden, voice turning even slower, ponderous. \u201cThose she takes an interest in are great, always, no matter whether they are terrible or wonderful. It is a gift that she has, my many-times grandmother. To find the best and know them, even when they do not know it themselves. Tell me, daughter of House Stark: what would drive a girl with Visenya\u2019s stamp to come this far north?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead,\u201d says Sansa, swallowing. \u201cAs it drove you, once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to the Wall because I did not wish to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you crossed it because there was something happening, and you wished to know what it was.\u201d Sansa juts her chin upwards. \u201cI know that the dead are there. My brother- Jon- has fought against armies of them. Legions. Ghosts that have never feared for anything in their entire existence are shivering, timorous beings. And I know that I can help against them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d asks Brynden, slowly shifting forwards, like a tree bending in a strong gale. \u201cTell me what you will do.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stares into his lone, red eye. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. Jon makes an aborted sound behind her; she ignores him. \u201cBut you do.\u201d</p><p>Again, there\u2019s silence. This time, it doesn\u2019t stay silent, not for Sansa. Her heartbeat echoes and echoes against her ears, thundering like a drum. She\u2019s gambled so much on three words. If she\u2019s wrong- if her grandmother, if her grandfather- are wrong- </p><p>Death will be the least of her worries.</p><p>But then, Brynden Waters nods. Short, shaky; but a nod nevertheless.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is a long tale. And to appreciate it properly, you shall need- need to know more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of what?\u201d asks Sansa sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the final secret of your house, Sansa Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him,\u201d says Bran, who\u2019s seated beside her. His eyes are glowing, in the dim light. It looks so strange. \u201cHe knows it already, Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Sansa says, \u201cThere was a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Brynden, softly. \u201cThere was.\u201d Then, a little more briskly: \u201cTake rest for now. Sleep, eat; the Children shall help you. And tonight, they shall tell you a story. It will answer some of your questions, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t speak again. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>That night, Sansa\u2019s seated besides Jon in an enormous cavern. She\u2019s eaten some sort of a stew; it\u2019s not very filling, but is very warm, so she\u2019s rather grateful for it anyhow. Then the quiet movements around her still- people seat themselves, settle in as always for stories, the same way people would do in Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall.</p><p>The Children whisper amongst each other, a gentle susurration of sound. Sansa waits.</p><p>Finally, a woman steps forward- or, Sansa thinks it\u2019s a woman; she has more delicate features than some of the others, and a slightly higher voice- and she speaks, words accented strangely.</p><p>\u201cI remember a time millennia past,\u201d she says, \u201cthat you cannot possibly imagine. Things of wonder and horror and magic.\u201d She pauses, and her green eyes glow brighter. \u201cYou have said that you know of the Pact. For years after signing it, we had peace. Many of our number did not think it possible- that your people could ever honor something when they loved its opposite so dearly, for not a single year went by without war of some sort. But you managed to hold the treaty for centuries. And then you came for our forests.\u201d</p><p>Another child says something, cutting her off. They sound irritable, or perhaps reprimanding; the one who\u2019d spoken responds sharply and they fall into an argument that slithers around Sansa\u2019s ears as so many snakes.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain-\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d </i>Sansa replies, hissing, into Jon\u2019s ear. Yes, she is certain this is necessary. Not a good idea, perhaps. Not a safe idea, perhaps. But these people haven\u2019t hurt Bran in the weeks that he\u2019s been with them, and she also knows full well how it feels to have a person- a real, live person, with even the slightest bit of power- ask for an explanation without ulterior motives. They want to tell her this story. It might not be easy, but- she can feel its importance already, in the way the words trip up her spine like so many warmed stones.</p><p>Finally, the child who\u2019d spoken returns her attention to them. \u201cMy- companion-\u201d she says, in a voice that lets Sansa know how this admission galls her, \u201c-wishes you to know that your people\u2019s greed was not all of it. There were offerings given, and treaties struck, and we responded to a few cases of greed with overmuch zeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfferings?\u201d Jon inquires. </p><p>He could sound more polite, but he could also sound far less. Sansa decides to cut her losses instead of snapping at him.</p><p>\u201cOf wool, and silks, and meat that dwells in flatlands that we hadn\u2019t access to for years.\u201d The child shrugs. \u201cYou wished for wood, and we offered that in return for all of those things. But some men took more than they gave. When we went to your kings\u2026 they did not hear us. They did not listen.\u201d She lowers her voice, until it sounds like the wind\u2019s rasp through a tree\u2019s leaves. \u201cOne of the proudest, one of the greatest, was Brandon Builder. We do not have kings, did not have them even when our numbers rivalled your own- but we saw through the trees and realized you would not listen if we sent one of us alone to you. So we sang a child out of the mud, each one of us giving him a gift of our own. And we sent him to your king, this child of the Children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what he said?\u201d another child asks. This one has a rounder face, sharper cheekbones; he looks younger than the first one. \u201cBrandon Builder, your thousand-times forefather- he refused to hear us. And when our child returned, he called us together for war.\u201d</p><p>The first one continues: \u201cThe child was not the proper answer to our problems. We had wished to ready him for kings, and in doing so we made him too proud. Too vengeful. He led us into a war we were not ready for, for reasons none of us knew save for injured pride and revenge.\u201d She snorts. \u201cThe first act of the war was our last.\u201d</p><p><i>One act, </i>Sansa thinks, fingers drumming against her thigh.<i> One act, so terrible it destroyed an entire race.</i></p><p>\u201cBrandon Builder had one daughter,\u201d says the second child. </p><p>Jon shakes his head almost immediately. \u201cHe had only sons,\u201d he challenges. \u201cThree sons, and no daughters. If there\u2019s one thing everyone agrees upon-\u201d</p><p><i>The first truth,</i> Sansa thinks, a chill gripping her bones. <i>The oldest Stark truth: there was a daughter.</i></p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says, reaching out to grip his elbow, eyes affixed to the children. \u201cJust- listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had five sons,\u201d whispers the first child. \u201cI know it well, Stark-son. I was there for it all. He had five sons: one heir and another with arrows sharp as dragonglass and another with a tongue even sharper and another with eyes bright as a sunrise and another with a gift for crafting that even his father did not have; and one daughter: her name was-\u201d she says something, a long, liquid stream of syllables that makes Sansa shiver; it slips out of her mind almost immediately, however, and for all that she tries, she cannot remember it. </p><p>She smiles thinly. \u201cYou will not remember her name. Only those who knew her before she- she became what she is now, can know it. We sacrificed that in the name of our vengeance.\u201d</p><p>Jon turns his head towards Sansa, creakingly slowly. There\u2019s an old terror in his eyes, and she finds herself reaching forwards, slotting her fingers through his. </p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Sansa asks, quietly. <i>How do you unmake a name? How is that</i> possible?</p><p>\u201cThe child that we made- he was made, you see. Until him- Children appeared. We are of the trees and the streams, and when the magic is enough we are formed, whole. That is how I came, from a poplar tree; that is how-\u201d another string of syllables that Sansa could not pronounce, though this one stays in her mind, \u201c-came, from a stone rounded at the bend of a river. It is how we all come. Until we made <i>him,</i> and though he looked and spoke and sang as if one of us, he did not have what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContentment.\u201d She reaches forwards and the trees before her burst into flowers- greenish rim, with a scarlet middle. Poplar flowers. \u201cWhen the land has enough, it is contented. It is not <i>greedy.</i> But he did not have that in him, though he had enough to know what he did not have.\u201d</p><p>Jon lifts one eyebrow. \u201cHumans can be greedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this kind of greedy. The kind where you have nothing inside of you, where there is a coldness within in the place of a soul. He wanted. And so he took, and named it vengeance so we would follow him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe formed the Others, then,\u201d Sansa says, with certainty. Horror is there, yes, but the world seems to thrum above that, a drum-beat in echo with her heart. This is important, and a history that ought to be known. \u201cHe cut souls out of other- people, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>The first child closes her hand into a fist, and the poplar flowers shrivel. \u201cWe stole Brandon Builder\u2019s daughter. And we watched as he did it- as he transferred her soul into his body. But souls are not meant to be cut out like that, nor to be touched by mortal hands. It was not a good job- he left pieces behind in her, of her soul, could not do enough. He was vaporized- the world caved in around us. We all nearly died. And the Night\u2019s Queen was formed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon Builder raged.\u201d The other child\u2019s voice rustles, like water, like waves. She sounds empty. \u201cShe was beautiful and terrible and there was nothing that we could do against her. So we went to him, and Brandon Builder killed our envoys, led an army of a hundred thousand into our forests and cut us down where we slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Night\u2019s Queen killed us for the emptiness of her soul, and Brandon Builder killed us for our cruelty. At first she fed on Children alone; but when humans came too close, she had few compunctions about killing them as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe killed two of her brothers,\u201d says the second child. \u201cThe heir, and the crafter. They who had tried to bring back their sister died before even uttering a word, and finally, still mourning, Brandon Builder called his people together and built a monument that still lasts to this day.\u201d</p><p><i>What in the world-</i></p><p>\u201cThe Wall,\u201d whispers Jon.</p><p>The Children hiss angrily at the word. It takes Sansa a moment to understand, because- well, they\u2019ve not understood anything Sansa and Jon have said in the entire conversation; or at least they\u2019ve pretended not to- but this word, this single word- it\u2019s not in the Old Tongue, but the children know it.</p><p><i>Wall, </i>thinks Sansa. The word they use now recalls the structure that Brandon built. It is, perhaps, the oldest word in their language.</p><p>The first child inclines her head slowly. \u201cEight thousand years later, and we still cannot approach it. The magic woven into it- it\u2019s something that repels us. We cannot cross it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so,\u201d Jon says flatly, \u201cyou died out.\u201d</p><p>The second folds her hands together. \u201cEven so. The last great thing we did was to erase her from history. Her name is gone. No longer can it remain in memory or writing, save for those who were alive and knew it before the spell was cast. And year by year, that number lessens. Until all those left are those before you now, whittled down to tens that once numbered millions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d whispers Sansa.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d says the first child, \u201cyou asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA name gives power,\u201d says the second child. \u201cQuiet power. Still power. But power nonetheless. Why do you think you name your sons Brandon? Because there is a power to it, one that you know but cannot understand. The Night\u2019s Queen\u2019s father knew this, and didn\u2019t wish for it to happen. He had lost almost everything to us. Two sons, his sole daughter; the peace he\u2019d fought for all his life. And he came to us and asked us for one boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hollow boon, perhaps, but a boon nevertheless.\u201d The first child smiles, ghastly. \u201cWe gave it to him. You know what we called it, when we did? <i>The highest kindness.</i> The best apology we could make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it enough?\u201d asks Jon.</p><p>Sansa knows the answer before ever the Children speak. How can it ever be enough? Life for a life is unequal, always. One life can never be matched by another. Hundreds? Thousands? It is like asking which is more devastating: the tides, or the floods. Each, in its own way. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says the first child. \u201cBut we tried.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a scraping sound from the weirwood throne- Sansa jerks her head up and looks at Brynden Waters, whom she\u2019d forgotten existed, while listening to the story.</p><p>\u201cYou asked what you can do, Sansa Stark,\u201d he says, scrapingly slowly. \u201cAnd this is your answer: you are the latest descendant of this house, which has scarred this land immeasurably. It is your burden. To stand; to fight. What can you do? You are a protector. Stripped bare, carved hollow, bleeding and weeping to death- you are a protector.\u201d He smiles, and it carves into his face like a weirwood\u2019s tears. \u201cWhat can you do? You can protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s-\u201d Jon begins.</p><p>But Brynden speaks over him, like he isn\u2019t even there. </p><p>\u201cYour brother will keep greenseeing alive. Those are older traditions than those of House Stark. But for this war? You will need to fight its most vital battle. You will need to be unfaltering. Stronger than any other. Stronger than even you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s shaking his head. Bran looks pale, strained. The other Children are shifting uneasily.</p><p>Sansa lifts her head, meets Brynden Waters\u2019 lone, red eye.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I fight it?\u201d she asks.</p>",

The weight of a hundred worlds could have borne down on her \u00a0tongue, and it would not have mattered.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d says Sansa, softly. He goes stiff about the shoulders. \u201cAnd neither did I.\u201d</p><p>Jon whirls around, and Sansa has all of a heartbeat to realize that he\u2019s not been calmed by seeing Lady; he\u2019s palmed a knife instead, one that he uses to slash at Sansa\u2019s arm. She stumbles back, sleeve ripping, and Jon uses the moment to draw his sword.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d he asks, eyes narrowing on her.</p><p>Sansa smiles tremulously. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to talk, you\u2019ll drop that sword.\u201d He doesn\u2019t soften, not even a little, and Sansa feels her heart stumble a little. Her mother, her father- they wouldn\u2019t have recognized her, would they? She\u2019s changed so much that-</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says, struggling to keep her voice even, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you think-\u201d</p><p>Her words are cut off when Jon releases a flurry of blows at her, half of which she catches as a matter of habit and the other half of which she deflects by sheer chance. His hands tighten further on his sword\u2019s hilt and Sansa takes two large steps backwards, her lungs aching.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>Sansa,\u201d</i> she snaps breathlessly. \u201cYou absolute moron, it\u2019s <i>me,</i> stop fighting-\u201d</p><p>Jon laughs. Then he says, \u201cMy sister\u2019s in King\u2019s Landing. If you want to lie to me, try to do better than that.\u201d</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this. Listen to me, you utter buffoon!</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d says Sansa, fright and irritation melding together into a strange amalgam in her chest to produce an even stranger voice. \u201cListen, I need you to <i>listen-\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d replies Jon, and spins neatly to catch her across her underarm. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Sansa ducks away, a shriek caught in her throat.</p><p>(Sansa\u2019s always prepared. </p><p>This is one thing that everyone seems to forget about her: she\u2019s never had as native a skill at sewing as everyone seems to assume, but once she realized how important it was for ladies- Sansa\u2019d spent nights and mornings and every spare moment of her time sawing that needle through the cloth until it resembled the primers they\u2019d been given. </p><p>Everyone always forgets that. </p><p>Jon Snow is not an exception.)</p><p>(Now, here\u2019s a tale that hasn\u2019t been told:</p><p>When Sansa forgave Elia, there was a scrap of silver that Elia let fall into the sand, far below them both. Elia, Elia, Elia Martell: of Nymeria and Mors, daughter of Arianne, with the sun\u2019s sparks sunk deep into her bones. That silver that fell- it burned and blistered the sand, and when Sansa ran over it hours later it remained hot to the touch, blazing even through the soles of her sandals.</p><p>Sansa wrapped it up in cloth soaked in saltwater and remembered grief, and took it with her North.)</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Sansa ducks away, a shriek building in her throat, and when Jon finishes the spin, turning to meet her, she throws one fistful of sand-embers straight into his face. He backs away, clawing at his eyes. She doesn\u2019t hesitate at that- if there\u2019s one thing she\u2019s learned from Visenya it\u2019s <i>do not pause.</i> Not for pain, not for love, not once you\u2019ve set upon a course. </p><p>With all the grace of a barreling ox, Sansa brings Dark Sister\u2019s hilt down on the side of Jon\u2019s head.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>She goes to get some of the melted snow from her camp, a ways away from where she\u2019d decided to confront Jon. There\u2019s little chance of Jon escaping, but Sansa\u2019s bound his hands and removed both his sword and the visible daggers anyhow. Lugging the water back leaves red marks along her palms- Sansa grits her teeth and bears through the pain.</p><p>He\u2019s awake and half-escaped the ropes Sansa\u2019d tied him up with when she returns.</p><p>\u201cGods <i>above,\u201d</i> Sansa says, driving the bucket into the snow with one sharp motion. \u201cIf you continue to do that, I\u2019ll- I\u2019ll dump this water on you, see if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jon freezes, before slowly relaxing. \u201cThis is a dream,\u201d he mutters to himself. The confusion on his face softens Sansa\u2019s ire, just enough for her to seat herself in front of him. </p><p>\u201cYou dream of me often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is why this is so- surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d He looks up at the tone of her voice, at the abrupt intensity. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream. There are things I must tell you- necessary things. Dangerous things. Important things. You have to <i>listen,</i> not run away, not ignore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is so important?\u201d asks Jon, lifting one brow. </p><p>\u201cTo start out with-\u201d Sansa shifts uneasily, \u201c-you\u2019re in danger. People want to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Her hand spasms around her knee. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugs his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been in danger ever since I left Winterfell. I don\u2019t need any apparition from the gods to remind me of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>not </i>an apparition from any god!\u201d Sansa springs to her feet, the surge of emotion in her belly making it impossible to remain seated. </p><p>She sucks on her teeth in a vain attempt to stop looking at the melted water. It\u2019s supposed to be used to wash the mud from her hair and prove, finally, unequivocally, that she is who she says she is. But it would feel so good to just throw it on Jon and his stupid, stubborn face.</p><p>\u201cGive me one good reason, then,\u201d says Jon, \u201cwhy Sansa Stark would be here at the Wall. Start with how- how she left King\u2019s Landing, and then with how she survived the trek all the way here, and then with how she came to have- is that <i>mud</i> on your hair?- short hair, and- and a fucking sword!\u201d He pauses, breathing heavily, before continuing even louder: \u201cA sword! That she knows how to use! You tell me who\u2019d have taught her, and then how she got Ghost to bring me out of the castle, and why, out of all the bloody castles in all the world, she\u2019d choose this one! Answer that and <i>yes,</i> then I might believe you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t look like her?\u201d Sansa asks. She\u2019s aiming for levity, but it falls flat; it sounds too strained, and she has to hide her flinch at both the wound she\u2019s revealed as well as the thin sound of her voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Jon, scornfully. \u201cIf she ever dressed up as an urchin it\u2019d not last longer than one afternoon. The mud would be too much for Sansa, I think, more than even the hunger.\u201d</p><p><i>What a terrible thing, </i>Sansa thinks distantly, <i>to hear the truth.</i></p><p>But she has her pride, now, along with her love and fear and anger. So she only lifts her chin and smiles and makes sure- with enough ferocity to make even a Targaryen quail- that the smile doesn\u2019t wobble.</p><p>\u201cI left King\u2019s Landing through the kitchens.\u201d One breath to keep her voice even, and a second to keep her eyes level, and the third is for no reason other than that she wants it. \u201cI cut my hair and burned it before I left. It wasn\u2019t so difficult, in all honesty: nobody expected that I\u2019d escape on my own, and less that I\u2019d escape disguised as a boy.\u201d <i>Not even you, brother mine.</i> \u201cI stole some food, and some clothes, but not from people who couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. That comes to who taught me, and you\u2019d not believe that if you don\u2019t believe the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>Jon leans forwards. \u201cLet\u2019s say I believe you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon-\u201d Sansa says, slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me the story.\u201d His eyes are glittering, hard and unyielding. This is not the brother Sansa knows; this is the Lord Commander that the Night\u2019s Watch has elected. \u201cSo tell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s name is Dark Sister.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment\u2019s pause, and then Jon realizes where he\u2019s heard that name. His eyes dip to the sword, and then rise to meet hers, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cMade of Valyrian steel,\u201d Sansa continues, when he keeps silent. \u201cIts first owner gave it to me. And she was the one to teach me swordfighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first owner was-\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisenya.\u201d She inclines her head. \u201cOf House Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s jaw is slack. He keeps staring at the sword and then back to her. After a moment- he hisses out through his teeth, a sound so derisive it catches in her chest.</p><p>\u201cI can see ghosts,\u201d Sansa tells him, the syllables stretching out her throat, thick and glutinous. \u201cEver since I was three namedays old- I\u2019ve been able to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had strange dreams,\u201d Jon mumbles, \u201cbut never<i> this</i> strange.\u201d</p><p>And, abruptly, the frustration fades, replaced instead by exhaustion. \u201cI would be much happier if it were truly a jape,\u201d Sansa says flatly. \u201cOr a dream, or anything but the truth. But it is not. I have lived with this secret for more than a decade, Jon. And I left the Red Keep, I left Riverrun, I left <i>Winterfell-</i> more than a dozen castles I\u2019ve passed, each one happier than the other to house me and protect me, and I\u2019ve left it all behind to come here.\u201d <i>I\u2019ve left behind more than that, as well.</i> \u201cYou can keep thinking it\u2019s a dream if you want, but you\u2019ll have to help me nevertheless.\u201d</p><p>He tips his head to the side. \u201cHelp- how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a gate.\u201d Sansa reaches forwards, to the hands that Jon\u2019s unbound- if she had nails they might have dug into his skin, but she\u2019s bitten them to the quick instead- and looks into his eyes, dark and honest and sharp as her father\u2019s. <i>I don\u2019t trust anyone,</i> she thinks fiercely, but Jon\u2019s hands are warm and alive and she can\u2019t keep herself from gripping them too tightly. \u201cIn Castle Black. You have to get me through it, to the other side of the Wall.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>When Jon goes to pick up the keys, Willam appears to her once more. Sansa sighs and seats herself, quietly, wishing her hair were longer- braiding it would give her something to do with her hands. She feels strained and worn instead. Like licorice pulled thin enough that it was transparent.</p><p>Her parents don\u2019t know where she is. Her brother didn\u2019t recognize her, and doesn\u2019t trust her even when she tells him the truth. Sansa Stark, for all that she is alive, might as well not exist. </p><p><i>Does it matter where a person is,</i> she wants to ask Willam- wants to ask Lyarra, wants to ask Minisa-<i> if there is no one else in all the world who knows where they are? </i></p><p>She doesn\u2019t. She leans back and shrugs under Willam\u2019s piercing stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asks Sansa, in the place of all the other things on the tip of her tongue. \u201cI got him to do what needed to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks you some creature borne out of the old tales,\u201d Willam responds. \u201cSome prophet, perhaps, or a Child. Anything but his sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-because it is so unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause-\u201d and here, Willam\u2019s tone gentles, just a little, \u201c-you are showing him sides of yourself you have kept shrouded in darkness all your life. It is as if a glass merchant spent all his life selling glass, and then shifted to selling diamond. Will there not be people who come to you, expecting glass wares? Will they not be surprised, startled, when that is not offered to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConstancy is comfort,\u201d Sansa says, quietly.</p><p>Willam smiles at her. \u201cJust so. Change is difficult for people to accept. You should not have approached him as an adversary in the beginning.\u201d He shifts, and shines like snow in the pale sunlight. \u201cYou will have to change that, later. It will be more difficult now.\u201d</p><p><i>It is the truth. Shall you turn from it?</i></p><p>Months ago, Sansa had sat in the Red Keep and looked at her grandfather, and she\u2019d thought, <i>yes.</i></p><p><i>No,</i> she thinks now, and she doesn\u2019t know what has changed, knows only that there is cold in her lungs and ice along her scalp and she has stiffened with it instead of freezing alive, knows only that she is stronger within her family\u2019s lands for reasons she cannot explain to anyone, reasons that still exist. <i>No, I will not turn away. I will face the worst fears. I swear it.</i></p><p>\u201cMy grandfather,\u201d she says, mouth dry. She doesn\u2019t want to continue talking about truths that ache like this. \u201cWhen I was in the Red Keep, he told me that there was one secret that ought to be told, one secret that wasn\u2019t his place to tell me. He told me to tell Lyarra.\u201d <i>But I don\u2019t trust Lyarra. She\u2019s not telling me everything.</i> \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>Willam looks a little paler at her words. \u201cLyarra told me that Rickard\u2019s told you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything but the first secret.\u201d That had been what Rickard called it, once, casually thrown into their conversations those last few weeks. \u201cThe one that began the Stark line.\u201d</p><p>Again, there\u2019s hesitation. Slowly, Willam nods; and then he says, softly, \u201c It is the first secret, and always the last told. Brandon the Builder forbade his sons from ever speaking it, and Brandon the Breaker did the same, but the knowledge has lasted nevertheless.\u201d He frowns. \u201cI never understood it, truth be told- perhaps it shall make more sense to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a daughter.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, Sansa realizes that it\u2019s it; those four words are the secret that Rickard knew, that last bit of Stark knowledge that has been whispered for years, from heir to lord to heir again. She wants to claw at her skin, just a little, with sheer frustration.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d she says, quietly. \u201cWho had a daughter? Why was she- why is she so important? That knowledge of her remains past years and years of loss?\u201d </p><p>Willam smiles at her sadly. \u201c\u2018Tis a mark of growth, to ask questions that your elders cannot answer. Perhaps you shall solve this secret, little daughter. A thing to put your name to, when this is all over.\u201d</p><p><i>If I do as Lyarra wishes,</i> Sansa thinks, ugliness lining her throat, terror and desire hot in her gut, <i>I will put my name on this entire world.</i></p><p><i>They will never forget </i>me,<i> not after all I have lost.</i></p><p>The air is cold and her gloves are thin and her eyes itch. Sansa feels the wind along her thin, thin hair and she imagines a sweep of red down her back, long and beautiful as a hawk\u2019s wings. She is exhausted, bitter, alone. She has never felt fiercer than she has in that moment, the wind billowing her from the back, sunlight shining on that skin, alive against all odds.</p><p><i>If I cannot be happy, then I will be remembered.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>Sansa does, eventually, wash the mud from her hair, but it does little to lessen the suspicion on his face. Even with Lady obeying her commands, docile as a dog, he doesn\u2019t think she is- Sansa Stark- Jon seems to think she\u2019s something else altogether, and not a benign entity at that.</p><p>But he smuggles her through the castle quietly; and when they reach the tunnel, Jon doesn\u2019t hesitate to plunge into the darkness.</p><p>For a long moment, Sansa hesitates. Then she starts walking, Lady and Ghost keeping time behind her. They pause at one of the iron gates as Jon fumbles at the lock with a key. When the tunnel doesn\u2019t lighten at all, she coughs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s- how many gates are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d Jon answers brusquely. \u201cTwo more.\u201d</p><p><i>Three. </i>Sansa can feel her palms growing clammy, but she doesn\u2019t dare loosen her grip on Dark Sister\u2019s hilt to wipe it. In two more gates, she has to be ready to\u2026 <i>It isn\u2019t kidnapping. It\u2019s saving a life.</i></p><p>And she has both Ghost and Lady on her side. </p><p>One more gate, then the last one. </p><p>Jon slides the key in, shoulders the slatted steel through, and Sansa emerges into the cold winter light of the world beyond the Wall. His eyes- dark and wary- are fixed on her, not on the snows around them. Sansa feels the pull of that beauty, the desire to see that and admire it, but she puts it aside to focus on her brother.</p><p><i>I will not let you die, </i>she thinks, and smiles thinly at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jon relaxes just a little at her words, but Sansa\u2019s not done, not close. She steps forwards and catches his hand. \u201cCome with me,\u201d she whispers. \u201cYour life isn\u2019t safe here, Jon. Even if they don\u2019t do something immediately- people are trying to kill you, and it is always easier to take a life than it is to keep one. And\u2026 and it will be better if you were with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have sworn vows,\u201d Jon replies, but it\u2019s gentler than he\u2019s sounded in some time. \u201cI have no choice.\u201d</p><p>Sansa steps away. The leather of her boots feels like it might creak- it is so old, and her feet are curling with her impatience- but this must be done properly. She hasn\u2019t felt this regretful of something in a long time; even when she left Riverrun, the only pain she bartered with was her own. Now, it is Jon\u2019s she is toying with. His pain, his honor, his life.</p><p>If her stay in the south has taught her anything, it is that honor is worth only that value that the person places in it; and that a little pain is preferable to the loss of a life. <i>This is necessary,</i> she reminds herself. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Sansa responds, and sees how he softens further at her tone. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about that, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish-\u201d he breaks off the words abruptly, shaking his head. \u201cGoodbye, then. The debt I owed you for losing to the duel is through. Good travels to you, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never loved you as I ought,\u201d Sansa muses, letting one hand fall open to her side. The direwolves are far more intelligent than many people assume, which is to their detriment. But Sansa hadn\u2019t ever thought that even Jon would ignore Ghost\u2019s intellect, which is far beyond that of any common wolf\u2019s or other pet. When she\u2019d explained, the previous night, to him, Ghost had understood her. Sansa\u2019s sure of it. \u201cBut that does not mean I would be glad to see you dead. And if, at the end of all of this, you\u2019d like to go back- I would not stop you. But only after Father has come and taken care of these men who wish to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d says Sansa, before Ghost leaps at Jon and bears him down to the ground, before Lady gnaws through Jon\u2019s scabbard and divests him of half his weaponry, \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>While he\u2019s still disoriented, Sansa tosses the keys he\u2019d used to unlock the gates past the first one and then cuts the weight holding the winching gears back. Jon goes rigid when he hears the thunk of the heavy steel door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you-\u201d he spits, when he gets Lady\u2019s tail whipping straight into his face, \u201c-what- what\u2019re you <i>do-\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving your life,\u201d Sansa replies, evenly. </p><p>She belts his scabbard over her own waist. It settles easily enough, but is too tight for a second loop and too loose for just one. After a shrug, she slides it over her head so it rests at a diagonal: one part of the strap at her shoulder, another at her hip. It digs into her skin, but it\u2019s the best compromise she currently has.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jon hisses. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to-\u201d One of the direwolves barrels into him; Jon grunts and stumbles forwards. \u201cOur deal is <i>finished.</i> You cannot demand more of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a deal,\u201d Sansa says. \u201cI never thought of it as one. This is not a debt you are paying me, nor a deal we struck with swords in the woods.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen what is this?\u201d he demands. </p><p>She thinks of Willam, sitting beside her, silvered and shining. She thinks of his words: <i>There are debts between people, yes, often, but the world is not all of that. There is love as well.</i> She swallows. \u201cCall it whatever you want. But I am your sister, and I will not let you die for the foolishness of your pride.\u201d</p><p>He bristles. \u201cMy honor is-\u201d</p><p>Sansa reaches forwards and catches his hand, blindly, because she\u2019s looking into his eyes, because she knows Jon will believe this, even if he doesn\u2019t believe that she is real.</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d she says. \u201cThe dead are coming, and I can defeat them, and I ca- I <i>will-</i> do it alone but- could you live with yourself?\u201d Jon stares at her. \u201cIf I defeated them and you could have been beside me but weren\u2019t, because you were afraid?\u201d Sansa remembers Lyarra\u2019s cold, cold hands on the back of her neck, the chill that\u2019s offered her more comfort than almost anything else in her life. \u201cThey say that Bran and Rickon are alive, Jon. That they\u2019re beyond the Wall, and alive, and safe.\u201d A moment to catch her breath, and then she adds the last sentence, soft and gentle and all-shaking as an avalanche. \u201cHonor is important, yes, but the world is more important than one man\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>Jon tears his hands away from her and stumbles away. \u201cThese are vows I\u2019ve sworn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are people relying on me.\u201d</p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t move. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather would want me to honor what I\u2019ve sworn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather would want you to honor your duties to your family,\u201d Sansa says, harsher than she\u2019d expected the words to sound. The lie still tastes bitter on her tongue: <i>father, father, father.</i> \u201cAnd I swear to you, your familial duties lie here, not behind that Wall.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, not for very long at all; Jon bows his head and Sansa presses her hands together to keep from picking at her nails. Then he lifts his head and-</p><p>And he looks like an old, old hero, from one of those old tales. Not a Targaryen knight. Not a King of Winter. There\u2019s a tapestry hidden beside one of the crypts that Torrhen had shown her, once, parchment-thin and crumbly as old leaf, with a man\u2019s profile sketched in large, broad swathes. </p><p>It\u2019s faded. </p><p>It\u2019s glorious.</p><p>That\u2019s what Jon looks like, Sansa thinks. Old worries on a young face, beauty on bones that weren\u2019t built to carry them, strength dug up out of salt and snow and somehow still rooted deep. She wants to shrink away from the depths of the emotions she feels upon seeing his face; she wants to reach out and embrace it, let it burn her until she is nothing but ashes.</p><p><i>Targaryen,</i> a voice breathes into her ear, and she realizes- Visenya. He is Visenya, but younger, but tempered, but more loved than Visenya has ever known in centuries of either life or death. <i>Stark,</i> too, as Stark as Arya, who\u2019d been loved and adored for all she\u2019d never obeyed anyone\u2019s orders, but brighter, but uglier.</p><p>\u201cGive me my sword,\u201d says Jon, and the spell shatters as if someone had struck it with a hammer. </p><p>Sansa shudders back to life. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, a little numbly. \u201cYes, I will- do that.\u201d</p><p><i>Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. </i>She cannot breathe for the weight of the lies, none of them hers. There are tears in her eyes, and Sansa bites them back until her throat aches. <i>You have brought something into this world that is more terrible than you could have ever thought.</i></p><p>Jon hesitates, and then he firms his shoulders. \u201cWhich direction are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They walk for hours.</p><p>It is strange, to be with someone whose needs must be met- Sansa has gotten used to the dead, who are tireless and limited only by the boundaries they can cross. But Jon must eat and drink and sleep, so they trade watches, and divide the food as evenly as they can. </p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t realize that Jon doesn\u2019t believe her. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t, though- not until almost a sennight after they set out.</p><p>They\u2019re pitching their camp, and Sansa\u2019s stirring the fire with a knobbly stick while Jon returns with enough wood to keep the fire going through the night. There\u2019s dried berries and the remains of a snow hare for dinner; Sansa feels nausea dig into her, so she hums a little ditty to herself. </p><p>It isn\u2019t much. Just a little girl\u2019s rendition of the sea shanties that Theon Stark had taught her, which were two octaves lower than her own voice. Barely audible, even to herself.</p><p>Jon, across the camp, hearing her over the crackle of the fire, stills. He mumbles something into the wood.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d asks Sansa.</p><p>He turns to her. And Jon\u2019s eyes- Sansa hasn\u2019t ever seen them like that before, liquid-bright and hot with something that could have been either horror or ecstasy. \u201cDo that again,\u201d he whispers, \u201cthat- song. The humming.\u201d</p><p>One up, three down, each note sharper than any sea shanty would ever be, but carrying its same rhythm. Sansa eyes Jon suspiciously but sings nevertheless.</p><p>Jon\u2019s face can\u2019t seem to decide what it feels. He pales further, until he looks like a half-ghost. Then he says, \u201cSa-\u201d his voice breaks, picking up momentum a breath later, \u201cSansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She flattens her hands on the fabric covering her knees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought- I\u2019d forgotten that- oh, gods.\u201d He sits down on the ground, right there, looking sick and joyous all at once. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sansa says slowly. \u201cI am myself. Is something the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t-\u201d Jon looks as white as a ghost. \u201cI thought you were some- something else. A- a story Old Nan hadn\u2019t remembered to tell us.\u201d</p><p>Sansa lifts an eyebrow. \u201cAnd that was more believable to you than me being myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t-\u201d he gestures violently, before reaching up to scrub through his hair. \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to <i>be</i> like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty.\u201d His eyes narrow on her, and Sansa feels her amusement rise to match his annoyance. \u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>She keeps her face as blank as she can make it, though her lips certainly twitch. \u201cBeing trained by a woman who conquered an entire continent has the ability to change a lot of things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou were not trained by Visenya Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas so.\u201d Sansa leans back, eyes wide and innocent. \u201cDid you know that she hates our grandfather?\u201d</p><p>Jon sputters. \u201cYou did <i>not</i> speak to our grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a tall man.\u201d She gnaws on the inside of her cheek to still her smile, though she can\u2019t quite hide it entirely. \u201cGrumpy, too. I see where you get it from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d he sighs.</p><p><i>\u201cJon,\u201d</i> she mimics, before dropping the amusement. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult to imagine. But you\u2019ve seen the dead- the actual <i>dead-</i> and the Night\u2019s King. Do you think me being able to see ghosts is so very different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says plainly. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to think the old stories are true. It\u2019s another to think that my sister\u2019s been lying to me for her entire life. Lying to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Sansa folds her hands over her lap. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because that would have gone over so well with Mother and Father,\u201d Sansa says flatly. \u201cOh, yes, I\u2019ve sown all the samplers you want, Mother, I\u2019ve done the letters you want, Father, and, by the way, I had a <i>fascinating</i> conversation with Torrhen Stark on how his daughter planted the first blue roses in Winterfell, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t fall asleep the way Arya did this afternoon!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s shouting by the end. Her eyes burn, just a little, but she pushes it away in favor of gripping her wrists tightly.</p><p>\u201cFather would have-\u201d Jon exhales, whistling it out through his teeth, \u201c-I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d have done, because this is- this is- so strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you understand,\u201d Sansa says.</p><p>Jon moves closer to her, slowly, hesitantly- he raises his hand as if he means to draw her into an embrace, and then he drops it to cuff her shoulder instead. \u201cI know that they love you. Your mother might not have\u2026\u201d he trails off, awkwardly, before settling against the log, back against her shins. \u201cLiked me, all that much. But she\u2019s always loved you, all of you. Arya at her brattiest. Robb at his angriest. You remember how much she yelled at Bran?\u201d</p><p>For weeks on end. Sansa remembers: her mother rigid with anger and worry, Bran limber and long-limbed. Every morning for two years, they\u2019d been woken by Catelyn yelling at Bran for climbing; so much it had become a routine, and still Bran had never thought she didn\u2019t love him. </p><p>Even in King\u2019s Landing- nobody, not a single soul, had ever doubted in Catelyn Stark\u2019s love for her children. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Sansa, soundless.</p><p>\u201cWe would have understood.\u201d He huffs a laugh. \u201cOr tried. We would have tried our best, at the least.\u201d</p><p>Sansa curls over her hands, hunching against the cold. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>I don\u2019t trust you, </i>thinks Sansa, hands cold, heart colder. <i>I don\u2019t believe you.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHow did you realize it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose songs. Nobody else ever liked them enough to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew I was myself because I sang a sea shanty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were yourself because nobody else could have sung it that badly.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cJon!\u201d</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>A week later, Sansa wakes to find a third wolf in their midst.</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d breathes Jon. </p><p>Sansa snaps her head towards him. \u201cThey\u2019re alive. Bran and Rickon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe them?\u201d Jon asks. \u201cYour ghosts-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t certain.\u201d She runs her fingers down Summer\u2019s dark fur. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be certain. There\u2019s been so many lies, you know- secrets, forgotten truths- I haven\u2019t trusted anyone. In a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for me,\u201d says Jon.</p><p>Then he seems to understand what Sansa\u2019s averted face means: Jon flinches as if she\u2019s struck him, and he steps forwards to look at her closer. </p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d he says.</p><p>She tilts her head up to meet his gaze. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s fault,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I <i>can,</i> anymore. Or if I ever could. I never really even considered telling anyone about how I could see ghosts, and that was before Rickard and Visenya\u2026 drove that point home.\u201d</p><p>Jon looks horrified for a long minute, but then he scoffs- scoffs and drops to sit next to her, looking vaguely irritated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cTrust isn\u2019t something that\u2019s- that\u2019s like hair color, or your height, or anything like that. It\u2019s not something you\u2019re born with. It- it certainly isn\u2019t your fault, Sansa, if people thought the truth was too dangerous to tell others.\u201d He turns, and eyes- Father\u2019s eyes- pierce through all of Sansa\u2019s shields, leave her open and bare and armorless. \u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault that people gave you secrets to hold.\u201d</p><p><i>This, </i>Sansa thinks contemplatively,<i> is the happiest I\u2019ve felt in years.</i></p><p>She\u2019s hungry, cold, lonely. She\u2019s never even imagined that her family might try to accept her for who she is- never even allowed that hope to materialize. Sansa swallows, and rises to her feet, and when she turns to help Jon to his feet, she pulls him into a hug as well.</p><p>He\u2019s so warm.</p><p>(Sansa\u2019s tears are soft things, born of Minisa and the giving, fertile loam of the Riverlands. But now- her tears are cold, sharp; they burn down her face like ice cracking the earth open. Sansa doesn\u2019t regret the pain at all.</p><p>They\u2019re tears of joy.)</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Summer leads them.</p><p>Sansa can\u2019t find it in herself to breathe, but somehow she manages. Somehow, she keeps herself moving: one foot after the other, one breath in after another, hope and fear swirling in her wake like footprints embedded in snow. </p><p>Bran\u2019s <i>alive,</i> and Sansa\u2019s near him- so close- they\u2019ll be together again.</p><p>Them. Their family. In a snow-ridden wasteland, hurt, so close to being cleaved apart.</p><p>But together.</p><p><i>The pack survives.</i> Sansa keeps walking, Jon beside her, head up as if scenting the wind. They are not wolves, not truly; but right then, Sansa thinks she\u2019ll shred anyone who tries to keep her from Bran to pieces. Right then, she cannot imagine that she is fangless, clawless. <i>I have been alone for too long.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>They emerge, three direwolves and two fur-bundled humans, into the middle of a dark clearing. </p><p>There are numerous people there.</p><p>There is only one person that Sansa cares about. She rises to her toes, straining for a glimpse of-</p><p>\u201cBran,\u201d whispers Sansa, at the shine of his red hair.</p><p>It\u2019s strange: Sansa is the slower of them, between her, and the direwolves, and Jon.</p><p>Perhaps there are wings that grow on her feet. Perhaps the wind aids her. Perhaps it\u2019s love, that gives her the speed to move so quickly. She feels something similar to it, at least: like solid flesh and blood has been replaced, for just a breath, with wind and ice.</p><p>Because she reaches Bran before Jon.</p><p>Bran, who is alive under her arms, who is warm and grown larger than the comatose figure she\u2019d last seen, who is <i>alive,</i> as she hasn\u2019t dreamt possible for months.</p><p>Then Jon is there, and he\u2019s holding onto Bran just as tightly, likely leaving bruises on both of their shoulders- but Sansa doesn\u2019t care. She couldn\u2019t possibly care about anything, not with her brothers beside her, safe and alive and in her arms.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They finally settle in a cave a little distant from the clearing Summer had led them to. It\u2019s large and dark, but dry; and when one of the others lights a match, Sansa realizes that they aren\u2019t wildlings at all. </p><p>Jon starts swearing when he finally sees the same thing. </p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t enemies,\u201d says Bran quietly, when he finally deciphers what both of their sputtering means. \u201cThey\u2019re- they saved my life. We were running, Meera and Jojen and I, and would\u2019ve been caught without Leaf\u2019s help. She brought us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran-\u201d</p><p>Sansa looks at them- the crowd that had allowed Bran to so much as meet them outside, for they\u2019d been the ones to wheel him out, certainly- and tries to pick out what, exactly, is leaving her so unnerved. Perhaps it\u2019s the features, which are so similar to her own and yet alien; perhaps it\u2019s the eyes, which are large and slitted as a cat. Perhaps it\u2019s the grace with which they move, too swift and curving for any human.</p><p>But Sansa\u2019s known ghosts for long enough to push past the initial terror, to search for the ground on which a bond can grow, so she tilts her head back at Bran.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d she asks, just as lowly.</p><p>He nods. </p><p>There\u2019s no hesitation there at all, and it\u2019s that which makes her mind up, more than anything else. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>He jerks his head irritably at her. Sansa ignores him, and gets up, moving slowly towards the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sansa,\u201d she says, when she\u2019s close enough for them to know that she\u2019s addressing them, when it\u2019s unmistakable. \u201cBran\u2019s sister. And this is Jon- he\u2019s our brother. We\u2026 we\u2019re here to help. Jon\u2019s spent years fighting the dead. He\u2019ll be invaluable to you.\u201d</p><p>One of the Children steps forwards slowly. \u201cWe have not the numbers for fighting,\u201d they say, in a voice that rolls over Sansa\u2019s skin like thunder. \u201cAnd less of the will. What use have we for a commander with no forces to command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak not for others,\u201d advises another of the Children, \u201conly for yourself.\u201d</p><p>A third one, with a voice that\u2019s high and sweet, says, \u201cI see you, sister of Bran.\u201d</p><p>Everyone falls silent at that. Behind her, Sansa can hear Bran inhale sharply. But nobody seems willing to elaborate on the statement, not until a child steps out of the crowd. It\u2019s too dark to make out much of their face.</p><p>\u201cYou shine almost as bright as the Crow,\u201d she says slowly, deliberately. \u201cYour brother has the potential to, and it shines as sparks off a stone in his chest. But you? Oh, you shed the light in your wake. His potential is realized in you, all without a weirwood to ground it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Sansa. She watches, numbly, as the child raises one hand to almost brush over her chest.</p><p>Then she feels someone dragging her backwards, and before she can blink, she\u2019s set behind Jon- who\u2019s standing in front of her with his shoulders thrown back, his legs spread as if to take a blow. \u201cStay back,\u201d he growls.</p><p>Bran reaches up and grips Sansa\u2019s wrist, dragging her attention back to him. \u201cShe\u2019s blind,\u201d he whispers. \u201cShe can see magic. Only magic. She\u2019s very old, and-\u201d</p><p>Sansa looks up, and sees the child tilt her head at Jon. Sees her say, \u201cOh, fire and ice. Alone they are common enough, but together? There are things that ought not to be in this world. You are one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d says Bran, and it\u2019s authoritative enough that they all fall silent. Even Jon stops bristling enough to be surprised that he\u2019s listening to Bran; Sansa\u2019s surprised enough, because she remembers how quiet he\u2019d been. Those months of watching Robb lead must have affected him in some manner though, and if this is it, she\u2019ll take it and be glad. \u201cPerhaps we can-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Crow will wish to see her,\u201d says the child. \u201cAnd him, I suppose, if for nothing more than the fire.\u201d</p><p>Bran nods as if her words make sense. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They arrive at a weirwood tree. The hall is well-lit, which is why Sansa can see the man sitting atop a seat made of the weirwood roots- he\u2019s pale and gaunt, save for a patchy rash running from the side of his neck up to his cheekbone. Fine, thin strands of silvery hair are in disarray around him.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Sansa asks carefully.</p><p>He tilts his head to her, but doesn\u2019t speak for a long minute. Sansa wonders if he\u2019s even going to answer- but then he does.</p><p>\u201cI am the three-eyed Crow,\u201d he says, voice hoarse and rasping. It makes Sansa want to shiver out of her skin, the unearthly scrape of it. \u201cBut I was not always this. Perhaps you have heard of a lord named Brynden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynden Waters,\u201d breathes Sansa. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says the man- Brynden, Brynden Waters, the person she\u2019s been charged with meeting by her grandmother and Visenya, two people who\u2019d likely never agree on anything else from this to the end of time. \u201cYou know of me, then.\u201d</p><p>Hands shaking, Sansa undoes her scabbard and removes Dark Sister. </p><p>\u201cYou would know this blade,\u201d she says. </p><p>He laughs. \u201cI would know that blade even if I\u2019d not seen it in half a thousand dreams. How came a Stark by Dark Sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Visenya\u2019s own tutelage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not tutor often,\u201d says Brynden, voice turning even slower, ponderous. \u201cThose she takes an interest in are great, always, no matter whether they are terrible or wonderful. It is a gift that she has, my many-times grandmother. To find the best and know them, even when they do not know it themselves. Tell me, daughter of House Stark: what would drive a girl with Visenya\u2019s stamp to come this far north?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead,\u201d says Sansa, swallowing. \u201cAs it drove you, once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to the Wall because I did not wish to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you crossed it because there was something happening, and you wished to know what it was.\u201d Sansa juts her chin upwards. \u201cI know that the dead are there. My brother- Jon- has fought against armies of them. Legions. Ghosts that have never feared for anything in their entire existence are shivering, timorous beings. And I know that I can help against them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d asks Brynden, slowly shifting forwards, like a tree bending in a strong gale. \u201cTell me what you will do.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stares into his lone, red eye. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. Jon makes an aborted sound behind her; she ignores him. \u201cBut you do.\u201d</p><p>Again, there\u2019s silence. This time, it doesn\u2019t stay silent, not for Sansa. Her heartbeat echoes and echoes against her ears, thundering like a drum. She\u2019s gambled so much on three words. If she\u2019s wrong- if her grandmother, if her grandfather- are wrong- </p><p>Death will be the least of her worries.</p><p>But then, Brynden Waters nods. Short, shaky; but a nod nevertheless.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is a long tale. And to appreciate it properly, you shall need- need to know more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of what?\u201d asks Sansa sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the final secret of your house, Sansa Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him,\u201d says Bran, who\u2019s seated beside her. His eyes are glowing, in the dim light. It looks so strange. \u201cHe knows it already, Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Sansa says, \u201cThere was a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Brynden, softly. \u201cThere was.\u201d Then, a little more briskly: \u201cTake rest for now. Sleep, eat; the Children shall help you. And tonight, they shall tell you a story. It will answer some of your questions, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t speak again. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>That night, Sansa\u2019s seated besides Jon in an enormous cavern. She\u2019s eaten some sort of a stew; it\u2019s not very filling, but is very warm, so she\u2019s rather grateful for it anyhow. Then the quiet movements around her still- people seat themselves, settle in as always for stories, the same way people would do in Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall.</p><p>The Children whisper amongst each other, a gentle susurration of sound. Sansa waits.</p><p>Finally, a woman steps forward- or, Sansa thinks it\u2019s a woman; she has more delicate features than some of the others, and a slightly higher voice- and she speaks, words accented strangely.</p><p>\u201cI remember a time millennia past,\u201d she says, \u201cthat you cannot possibly imagine. Things of wonder and horror and magic.\u201d She pauses, and her green eyes glow brighter. \u201cYou have said that you know of the Pact. For years after signing it, we had peace. Many of our number did not think it possible- that your people could ever honor something when they loved its opposite so dearly, for not a single year went by without war of some sort. But you managed to hold the treaty for centuries. And then you came for our forests.\u201d</p><p>Another child says something, cutting her off. They sound irritable, or perhaps reprimanding; the one who\u2019d spoken responds sharply and they fall into an argument that slithers around Sansa\u2019s ears as so many snakes.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain-\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d </i>Sansa replies, hissing, into Jon\u2019s ear. Yes, she is certain this is necessary. Not a good idea, perhaps. Not a safe idea, perhaps. But these people haven\u2019t hurt Bran in the weeks that he\u2019s been with them, and she also knows full well how it feels to have a person- a real, live person, with even the slightest bit of power- ask for an explanation without ulterior motives. They want to tell her this story. It might not be easy, but- she can feel its importance already, in the way the words trip up her spine like so many warmed stones.</p><p>Finally, the child who\u2019d spoken returns her attention to them. \u201cMy- companion-\u201d she says, in a voice that lets Sansa know how this admission galls her, \u201c-wishes you to know that your people\u2019s greed was not all of it. There were offerings given, and treaties struck, and we responded to a few cases of greed with overmuch zeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfferings?\u201d Jon inquires. </p><p>He could sound more polite, but he could also sound far less. Sansa decides to cut her losses instead of snapping at him.</p><p>\u201cOf wool, and silks, and meat that dwells in flatlands that we hadn\u2019t access to for years.\u201d The child shrugs. \u201cYou wished for wood, and we offered that in return for all of those things. But some men took more than they gave. When we went to your kings\u2026 they did not hear us. They did not listen.\u201d She lowers her voice, until it sounds like the wind\u2019s rasp through a tree\u2019s leaves. \u201cOne of the proudest, one of the greatest, was Brandon Builder. We do not have kings, did not have them even when our numbers rivalled your own- but we saw through the trees and realized you would not listen if we sent one of us alone to you. So we sang a child out of the mud, each one of us giving him a gift of our own. And we sent him to your king, this child of the Children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what he said?\u201d another child asks. This one has a rounder face, sharper cheekbones; he looks younger than the first one. \u201cBrandon Builder, your thousand-times forefather- he refused to hear us. And when our child returned, he called us together for war.\u201d</p><p>The first one continues: \u201cThe child was not the proper answer to our problems. We had wished to ready him for kings, and in doing so we made him too proud. Too vengeful. He led us into a war we were not ready for, for reasons none of us knew save for injured pride and revenge.\u201d She snorts. \u201cThe first act of the war was our last.\u201d</p><p><i>One act, </i>Sansa thinks, fingers drumming against her thigh.<i> One act, so terrible it destroyed an entire race.</i></p><p>\u201cBrandon Builder had one daughter,\u201d says the second child. </p><p>Jon shakes his head almost immediately. \u201cHe had only sons,\u201d he challenges. \u201cThree sons, and no daughters. If there\u2019s one thing everyone agrees upon-\u201d</p><p><i>The first truth,</i> Sansa thinks, a chill gripping her bones. <i>The oldest Stark truth: there was a daughter.</i></p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says, reaching out to grip his elbow, eyes affixed to the children. \u201cJust- listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had five sons,\u201d whispers the first child. \u201cI know it well, Stark-son. I was there for it all. He had five sons: one heir and another with arrows sharp as dragonglass and another with a tongue even sharper and another with eyes bright as a sunrise and another with a gift for crafting that even his father did not have; and one daughter: her name was-\u201d she says something, a long, liquid stream of syllables that makes Sansa shiver; it slips out of her mind almost immediately, however, and for all that she tries, she cannot remember it. </p><p>She smiles thinly. \u201cYou will not remember her name. Only those who knew her before she- she became what she is now, can know it. We sacrificed that in the name of our vengeance.\u201d</p><p>Jon turns his head towards Sansa, creakingly slowly. There\u2019s an old terror in his eyes, and she finds herself reaching forwards, slotting her fingers through his. </p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Sansa asks, quietly. <i>How do you unmake a name? How is that</i> possible?</p><p>\u201cThe child that we made- he was made, you see. Until him- Children appeared. We are of the trees and the streams, and when the magic is enough we are formed, whole. That is how I came, from a poplar tree; that is how-\u201d another string of syllables that Sansa could not pronounce, though this one stays in her mind, \u201c-came, from a stone rounded at the bend of a river. It is how we all come. Until we made <i>him,</i> and though he looked and spoke and sang as if one of us, he did not have what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContentment.\u201d She reaches forwards and the trees before her burst into flowers- greenish rim, with a scarlet middle. Poplar flowers. \u201cWhen the land has enough, it is contented. It is not <i>greedy.</i> But he did not have that in him, though he had enough to know what he did not have.\u201d</p><p>Jon lifts one eyebrow. \u201cHumans can be greedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this kind of greedy. The kind where you have nothing inside of you, where there is a coldness within in the place of a soul. He wanted. And so he took, and named it vengeance so we would follow him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe formed the Others, then,\u201d Sansa says, with certainty. Horror is there, yes, but the world seems to thrum above that, a drum-beat in echo with her heart. This is important, and a history that ought to be known. \u201cHe cut souls out of other- people, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>The first child closes her hand into a fist, and the poplar flowers shrivel. \u201cWe stole Brandon Builder\u2019s daughter. And we watched as he did it- as he transferred her soul into his body. But souls are not meant to be cut out like that, nor to be touched by mortal hands. It was not a good job- he left pieces behind in her, of her soul, could not do enough. He was vaporized- the world caved in around us. We all nearly died. And the Night\u2019s Queen was formed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon Builder raged.\u201d The other child\u2019s voice rustles, like water, like waves. She sounds empty. \u201cShe was beautiful and terrible and there was nothing that we could do against her. So we went to him, and Brandon Builder killed our envoys, led an army of a hundred thousand into our forests and cut us down where we slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Night\u2019s Queen killed us for the emptiness of her soul, and Brandon Builder killed us for our cruelty. At first she fed on Children alone; but when humans came too close, she had few compunctions about killing them as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe killed two of her brothers,\u201d says the second child. \u201cThe heir, and the crafter. They who had tried to bring back their sister died before even uttering a word, and finally, still mourning, Brandon Builder called his people together and built a monument that still lasts to this day.\u201d</p><p><i>What in the world-</i></p><p>\u201cThe Wall,\u201d whispers Jon.</p><p>The Children hiss angrily at the word. It takes Sansa a moment to understand, because- well, they\u2019ve not understood anything Sansa and Jon have said in the entire conversation; or at least they\u2019ve pretended not to- but this word, this single word- it\u2019s not in the Old Tongue, but the children know it.</p><p><i>Wall, </i>thinks Sansa. The word they use now recalls the structure that Brandon built. It is, perhaps, the oldest word in their language.</p><p>The first child inclines her head slowly. \u201cEight thousand years later, and we still cannot approach it. The magic woven into it- it\u2019s something that repels us. We cannot cross it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so,\u201d Jon says flatly, \u201cyou died out.\u201d</p><p>The second folds her hands together. \u201cEven so. The last great thing we did was to erase her from history. Her name is gone. No longer can it remain in memory or writing, save for those who were alive and knew it before the spell was cast. And year by year, that number lessens. Until all those left are those before you now, whittled down to tens that once numbered millions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d whispers Sansa.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d says the first child, \u201cyou asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA name gives power,\u201d says the second child. \u201cQuiet power. Still power. But power nonetheless. Why do you think you name your sons Brandon? Because there is a power to it, one that you know but cannot understand. The Night\u2019s Queen\u2019s father knew this, and didn\u2019t wish for it to happen. He had lost almost everything to us. Two sons, his sole daughter; the peace he\u2019d fought for all his life. And he came to us and asked us for one boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hollow boon, perhaps, but a boon nevertheless.\u201d The first child smiles, ghastly. \u201cWe gave it to him. You know what we called it, when we did? <i>The highest kindness.</i> The best apology we could make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it enough?\u201d asks Jon.</p><p>Sansa knows the answer before ever the Children speak. How can it ever be enough? Life for a life is unequal, always. One life can never be matched by another. Hundreds? Thousands? It is like asking which is more devastating: the tides, or the floods. Each, in its own way. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says the first child. \u201cBut we tried.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a scraping sound from the weirwood throne- Sansa jerks her head up and looks at Brynden Waters, whom she\u2019d forgotten existed, while listening to the story.</p><p>\u201cYou asked what you can do, Sansa Stark,\u201d he says, scrapingly slowly. \u201cAnd this is your answer: you are the latest descendant of this house, which has scarred this land immeasurably. It is your burden. To stand; to fight. What can you do? You are a protector. Stripped bare, carved hollow, bleeding and weeping to death- you are a protector.\u201d He smiles, and it carves into his face like a weirwood\u2019s tears. \u201cWhat can you do? You can protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s-\u201d Jon begins.</p><p>But Brynden speaks over him, like he isn\u2019t even there. </p><p>\u201cYour brother will keep greenseeing alive. Those are older traditions than those of House Stark. But for this war? You will need to fight its most vital battle. You will need to be unfaltering. Stronger than any other. Stronger than even you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s shaking his head. Bran looks pale, strained. The other Children are shifting uneasily.</p><p>Sansa lifts her head, meets Brynden Waters\u2019 lone, red eye.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I fight it?\u201d she asks.</p>",

There can be no mistakes made now: Sansa <i>must</i> succeed, for the price of failure is too great to contemplate, much less allow.</p><p>Lady- Sansa can sense her, vaguely, off behind the small bush she\u2019s hidden behind. She\u2019d yipped some time previous, but the silence now makes her feel wary. Their prey approaches, and Sansa must be fast enough to strike, quick enough to do so without letting him attack her in return.</p><p>And then she hears, distantly, the snap of a twig.</p><p>Dark Sister is perfectly balanced in one hand. Sansa shifts her weight from one leg to another, then back, ensuring she\u2019s ready to jump out. She breathes in, slowly, and Ghost bounds into the clearing.</p><p>Not a few minutes later, so does Jon.</p><p>Her breath catches.</p><p>He\u2019s older than she remembers; his hair is raggeder, and there\u2019s a stiffness to his shoulders that Sansa hasn\u2019t seen before. If anything, Jon\u2019s grown to look even more like their father.</p><p><i>My father. </i>The truth tastes like ashes in her mouth. <i>Jon\u2019s uncle.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat was so important, boy?\u201d Jon demands of Ghost, pressing his hands to his knees and panting. \u201cThat you had to-\u201d he straightens, abruptly, and half-draws his sword out of the scabbard, turning to the shadows exactly opposite to Sansa, from which a soft noise has come. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s there\u2026\u201d His voice sounds menacing. </p><p>Lady pads out of the darkness, and Sansa makes full use of Jon\u2019s momentary distraction to start moving forwards.</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d asks Jon, almost reaching out to touch her. \u201cYou survived? I didn\u2019t-\u201d he swallows, hard. \u201cI thought you\u2019d died.\u201d</p><p>She should keep silent, according to the very plan that she\u2019d hashed out last night- hit Jon over the head, and let him wake up after that, bound so he\u2019s forced to listen to her words. But seeing the way Jon\u2019s hands tremble, as if a strong wind had blown between the spaces of his fingers- Sansa cannot. The weight of a hundred worlds could have borne down on her \u00a0tongue, and it would not have mattered.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d says Sansa, softly. He goes stiff about the shoulders. \u201cAnd neither did I.\u201d</p><p>Jon whirls around, and Sansa has all of a heartbeat to realize that he\u2019s not been calmed by seeing Lady; he\u2019s palmed a knife instead, one that he uses to slash at Sansa\u2019s arm. She stumbles back, sleeve ripping, and Jon uses the moment to draw his sword.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d he asks, eyes narrowing on her.</p><p>Sansa smiles tremulously. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to talk, you\u2019ll drop that sword.\u201d He doesn\u2019t soften, not even a little, and Sansa feels her heart stumble a little. Her mother, her father- they wouldn\u2019t have recognized her, would they? She\u2019s changed so much that-</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says, struggling to keep her voice even, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you think-\u201d</p><p>Her words are cut off when Jon releases a flurry of blows at her, half of which she catches as a matter of habit and the other half of which she deflects by sheer chance. His hands tighten further on his sword\u2019s hilt and Sansa takes two large steps backwards, her lungs aching.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>Sansa,\u201d</i> she snaps breathlessly. \u201cYou absolute moron, it\u2019s <i>me,</i> stop fighting-\u201d</p><p>Jon laughs. Then he says, \u201cMy sister\u2019s in King\u2019s Landing. If you want to lie to me, try to do better than that.\u201d</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this. Listen to me, you utter buffoon!</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d says Sansa, fright and irritation melding together into a strange amalgam in her chest to produce an even stranger voice. \u201cListen, I need you to <i>listen-\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d replies Jon, and spins neatly to catch her across her underarm. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Sansa ducks away, a shriek caught in her throat.</p><p>(Sansa\u2019s always prepared. </p><p>This is one thing that everyone seems to forget about her: she\u2019s never had as native a skill at sewing as everyone seems to assume, but once she realized how important it was for ladies- Sansa\u2019d spent nights and mornings and every spare moment of her time sawing that needle through the cloth until it resembled the primers they\u2019d been given. </p><p>Everyone always forgets that. </p><p>Jon Snow is not an exception.)</p><p>(Now, here\u2019s a tale that hasn\u2019t been told:</p><p>When Sansa forgave Elia, there was a scrap of silver that Elia let fall into the sand, far below them both. Elia, Elia, Elia Martell: of Nymeria and Mors, daughter of Arianne, with the sun\u2019s sparks sunk deep into her bones. That silver that fell- it burned and blistered the sand, and when Sansa ran over it hours later it remained hot to the touch, blazing even through the soles of her sandals.</p><p>Sansa wrapped it up in cloth soaked in saltwater and remembered grief, and took it with her North.)</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Sansa ducks away, a shriek building in her throat, and when Jon finishes the spin, turning to meet her, she throws one fistful of sand-embers straight into his face. He backs away, clawing at his eyes. She doesn\u2019t hesitate at that- if there\u2019s one thing she\u2019s learned from Visenya it\u2019s <i>do not pause.</i> Not for pain, not for love, not once you\u2019ve set upon a course. </p><p>With all the grace of a barreling ox, Sansa brings Dark Sister\u2019s hilt down on the side of Jon\u2019s head.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>She goes to get some of the melted snow from her camp, a ways away from where she\u2019d decided to confront Jon. There\u2019s little chance of Jon escaping, but Sansa\u2019s bound his hands and removed both his sword and the visible daggers anyhow. Lugging the water back leaves red marks along her palms- Sansa grits her teeth and bears through the pain.</p><p>He\u2019s awake and half-escaped the ropes Sansa\u2019d tied him up with when she returns.</p><p>\u201cGods <i>above,\u201d</i> Sansa says, driving the bucket into the snow with one sharp motion. \u201cIf you continue to do that, I\u2019ll- I\u2019ll dump this water on you, see if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jon freezes, before slowly relaxing. \u201cThis is a dream,\u201d he mutters to himself. The confusion on his face softens Sansa\u2019s ire, just enough for her to seat herself in front of him. </p><p>\u201cYou dream of me often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is why this is so- surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d He looks up at the tone of her voice, at the abrupt intensity. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream. There are things I must tell you- necessary things. Dangerous things. Important things. You have to <i>listen,</i> not run away, not ignore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is so important?\u201d asks Jon, lifting one brow. </p><p>\u201cTo start out with-\u201d Sansa shifts uneasily, \u201c-you\u2019re in danger. People want to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Her hand spasms around her knee. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugs his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been in danger ever since I left Winterfell. I don\u2019t need any apparition from the gods to remind me of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>not </i>an apparition from any god!\u201d Sansa springs to her feet, the surge of emotion in her belly making it impossible to remain seated. </p><p>She sucks on her teeth in a vain attempt to stop looking at the melted water. It\u2019s supposed to be used to wash the mud from her hair and prove, finally, unequivocally, that she is who she says she is. But it would feel so good to just throw it on Jon and his stupid, stubborn face.</p><p>\u201cGive me one good reason, then,\u201d says Jon, \u201cwhy Sansa Stark would be here at the Wall. Start with how- how she left King\u2019s Landing, and then with how she survived the trek all the way here, and then with how she came to have- is that <i>mud</i> on your hair?- short hair, and- and a fucking sword!\u201d He pauses, breathing heavily, before continuing even louder: \u201cA sword! That she knows how to use! You tell me who\u2019d have taught her, and then how she got Ghost to bring me out of the castle, and why, out of all the bloody castles in all the world, she\u2019d choose this one! Answer that and <i>yes,</i> then I might believe you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t look like her?\u201d Sansa asks. She\u2019s aiming for levity, but it falls flat; it sounds too strained, and she has to hide her flinch at both the wound she\u2019s revealed as well as the thin sound of her voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Jon, scornfully. \u201cIf she ever dressed up as an urchin it\u2019d not last longer than one afternoon. The mud would be too much for Sansa, I think, more than even the hunger.\u201d</p><p><i>What a terrible thing, </i>Sansa thinks distantly, <i>to hear the truth.</i></p><p>But she has her pride, now, along with her love and fear and anger. So she only lifts her chin and smiles and makes sure- with enough ferocity to make even a Targaryen quail- that the smile doesn\u2019t wobble.</p><p>\u201cI left King\u2019s Landing through the kitchens.\u201d One breath to keep her voice even, and a second to keep her eyes level, and the third is for no reason other than that she wants it. \u201cI cut my hair and burned it before I left. It wasn\u2019t so difficult, in all honesty: nobody expected that I\u2019d escape on my own, and less that I\u2019d escape disguised as a boy.\u201d <i>Not even you, brother mine.</i> \u201cI stole some food, and some clothes, but not from people who couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. That comes to who taught me, and you\u2019d not believe that if you don\u2019t believe the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>Jon leans forwards. \u201cLet\u2019s say I believe you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon-\u201d Sansa says, slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me the story.\u201d His eyes are glittering, hard and unyielding. This is not the brother Sansa knows; this is the Lord Commander that the Night\u2019s Watch has elected. \u201cSo tell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s name is Dark Sister.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment\u2019s pause, and then Jon realizes where he\u2019s heard that name. His eyes dip to the sword, and then rise to meet hers, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cMade of Valyrian steel,\u201d Sansa continues, when he keeps silent. \u201cIts first owner gave it to me. And she was the one to teach me swordfighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first owner was-\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisenya.\u201d She inclines her head. \u201cOf House Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s jaw is slack. He keeps staring at the sword and then back to her. After a moment- he hisses out through his teeth, a sound so derisive it catches in her chest.</p><p>\u201cI can see ghosts,\u201d Sansa tells him, the syllables stretching out her throat, thick and glutinous. \u201cEver since I was three namedays old- I\u2019ve been able to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had strange dreams,\u201d Jon mumbles, \u201cbut never<i> this</i> strange.\u201d</p><p>And, abruptly, the frustration fades, replaced instead by exhaustion. \u201cI would be much happier if it were truly a jape,\u201d Sansa says flatly. \u201cOr a dream, or anything but the truth. But it is not. I have lived with this secret for more than a decade, Jon. And I left the Red Keep, I left Riverrun, I left <i>Winterfell-</i> more than a dozen castles I\u2019ve passed, each one happier than the other to house me and protect me, and I\u2019ve left it all behind to come here.\u201d <i>I\u2019ve left behind more than that, as well.</i> \u201cYou can keep thinking it\u2019s a dream if you want, but you\u2019ll have to help me nevertheless.\u201d</p><p>He tips his head to the side. \u201cHelp- how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a gate.\u201d Sansa reaches forwards, to the hands that Jon\u2019s unbound- if she had nails they might have dug into his skin, but she\u2019s bitten them to the quick instead- and looks into his eyes, dark and honest and sharp as her father\u2019s. <i>I don\u2019t trust anyone,</i> she thinks fiercely, but Jon\u2019s hands are warm and alive and she can\u2019t keep herself from gripping them too tightly. \u201cIn Castle Black. You have to get me through it, to the other side of the Wall.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>When Jon goes to pick up the keys, Willam appears to her once more. Sansa sighs and seats herself, quietly, wishing her hair were longer- braiding it would give her something to do with her hands. She feels strained and worn instead. Like licorice pulled thin enough that it was transparent.</p><p>Her parents don\u2019t know where she is. Her brother didn\u2019t recognize her, and doesn\u2019t trust her even when she tells him the truth. Sansa Stark, for all that she is alive, might as well not exist. </p><p><i>Does it matter where a person is,</i> she wants to ask Willam- wants to ask Lyarra, wants to ask Minisa-<i> if there is no one else in all the world who knows where they are? </i></p><p>She doesn\u2019t. She leans back and shrugs under Willam\u2019s piercing stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asks Sansa, in the place of all the other things on the tip of her tongue. \u201cI got him to do what needed to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks you some creature borne out of the old tales,\u201d Willam responds. \u201cSome prophet, perhaps, or a Child. Anything but his sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-because it is so unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause-\u201d and here, Willam\u2019s tone gentles, just a little, \u201c-you are showing him sides of yourself you have kept shrouded in darkness all your life. It is as if a glass merchant spent all his life selling glass, and then shifted to selling diamond. Will there not be people who come to you, expecting glass wares? Will they not be surprised, startled, when that is not offered to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConstancy is comfort,\u201d Sansa says, quietly.</p><p>Willam smiles at her. \u201cJust so. Change is difficult for people to accept. You should not have approached him as an adversary in the beginning.\u201d He shifts, and shines like snow in the pale sunlight. \u201cYou will have to change that, later. It will be more difficult now.\u201d</p><p><i>It is the truth. Shall you turn from it?</i></p><p>Months ago, Sansa had sat in the Red Keep and looked at her grandfather, and she\u2019d thought, <i>yes.</i></p><p><i>No,</i> she thinks now, and she doesn\u2019t know what has changed, knows only that there is cold in her lungs and ice along her scalp and she has stiffened with it instead of freezing alive, knows only that she is stronger within her family\u2019s lands for reasons she cannot explain to anyone, reasons that still exist. <i>No, I will not turn away. I will face the worst fears. I swear it.</i></p><p>\u201cMy grandfather,\u201d she says, mouth dry. She doesn\u2019t want to continue talking about truths that ache like this. \u201cWhen I was in the Red Keep, he told me that there was one secret that ought to be told, one secret that wasn\u2019t his place to tell me. He told me to tell Lyarra.\u201d <i>But I don\u2019t trust Lyarra. She\u2019s not telling me everything.</i> \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>Willam looks a little paler at her words. \u201cLyarra told me that Rickard\u2019s told you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything but the first secret.\u201d That had been what Rickard called it, once, casually thrown into their conversations those last few weeks. \u201cThe one that began the Stark line.\u201d</p><p>Again, there\u2019s hesitation. Slowly, Willam nods; and then he says, softly, \u201c It is the first secret, and always the last told. Brandon the Builder forbade his sons from ever speaking it, and Brandon the Breaker did the same, but the knowledge has lasted nevertheless.\u201d He frowns. \u201cI never understood it, truth be told- perhaps it shall make more sense to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a daughter.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, Sansa realizes that it\u2019s it; those four words are the secret that Rickard knew, that last bit of Stark knowledge that has been whispered for years, from heir to lord to heir again. She wants to claw at her skin, just a little, with sheer frustration.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d she says, quietly. \u201cWho had a daughter? Why was she- why is she so important? That knowledge of her remains past years and years of loss?\u201d </p><p>Willam smiles at her sadly. \u201c\u2018Tis a mark of growth, to ask questions that your elders cannot answer. Perhaps you shall solve this secret, little daughter. A thing to put your name to, when this is all over.\u201d</p><p><i>If I do as Lyarra wishes,</i> Sansa thinks, ugliness lining her throat, terror and desire hot in her gut, <i>I will put my name on this entire world.</i></p><p><i>They will never forget </i>me,<i> not after all I have lost.</i></p><p>The air is cold and her gloves are thin and her eyes itch. Sansa feels the wind along her thin, thin hair and she imagines a sweep of red down her back, long and beautiful as a hawk\u2019s wings. She is exhausted, bitter, alone. She has never felt fiercer than she has in that moment, the wind billowing her from the back, sunlight shining on that skin, alive against all odds.</p><p><i>If I cannot be happy, then I will be remembered.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>Sansa does, eventually, wash the mud from her hair, but it does little to lessen the suspicion on his face. Even with Lady obeying her commands, docile as a dog, he doesn\u2019t think she is- Sansa Stark- Jon seems to think she\u2019s something else altogether, and not a benign entity at that.</p><p>But he smuggles her through the castle quietly; and when they reach the tunnel, Jon doesn\u2019t hesitate to plunge into the darkness.</p><p>For a long moment, Sansa hesitates. Then she starts walking, Lady and Ghost keeping time behind her. They pause at one of the iron gates as Jon fumbles at the lock with a key. When the tunnel doesn\u2019t lighten at all, she coughs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s- how many gates are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d Jon answers brusquely. \u201cTwo more.\u201d</p><p><i>Three. </i>Sansa can feel her palms growing clammy, but she doesn\u2019t dare loosen her grip on Dark Sister\u2019s hilt to wipe it. In two more gates, she has to be ready to\u2026 <i>It isn\u2019t kidnapping. It\u2019s saving a life.</i></p><p>And she has both Ghost and Lady on her side. </p><p>One more gate, then the last one. </p><p>Jon slides the key in, shoulders the slatted steel through, and Sansa emerges into the cold winter light of the world beyond the Wall. His eyes- dark and wary- are fixed on her, not on the snows around them. Sansa feels the pull of that beauty, the desire to see that and admire it, but she puts it aside to focus on her brother.</p><p><i>I will not let you die, </i>she thinks, and smiles thinly at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jon relaxes just a little at her words, but Sansa\u2019s not done, not close. She steps forwards and catches his hand. \u201cCome with me,\u201d she whispers. \u201cYour life isn\u2019t safe here, Jon. Even if they don\u2019t do something immediately- people are trying to kill you, and it is always easier to take a life than it is to keep one. And\u2026 and it will be better if you were with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have sworn vows,\u201d Jon replies, but it\u2019s gentler than he\u2019s sounded in some time. \u201cI have no choice.\u201d</p><p>Sansa steps away. The leather of her boots feels like it might creak- it is so old, and her feet are curling with her impatience- but this must be done properly. She hasn\u2019t felt this regretful of something in a long time; even when she left Riverrun, the only pain she bartered with was her own. Now, it is Jon\u2019s she is toying with. His pain, his honor, his life.</p><p>If her stay in the south has taught her anything, it is that honor is worth only that value that the person places in it; and that a little pain is preferable to the loss of a life. <i>This is necessary,</i> she reminds herself. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Sansa responds, and sees how he softens further at her tone. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about that, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish-\u201d he breaks off the words abruptly, shaking his head. \u201cGoodbye, then. The debt I owed you for losing to the duel is through. Good travels to you, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never loved you as I ought,\u201d Sansa muses, letting one hand fall open to her side. The direwolves are far more intelligent than many people assume, which is to their detriment. But Sansa hadn\u2019t ever thought that even Jon would ignore Ghost\u2019s intellect, which is far beyond that of any common wolf\u2019s or other pet. When she\u2019d explained, the previous night, to him, Ghost had understood her. Sansa\u2019s sure of it. \u201cBut that does not mean I would be glad to see you dead. And if, at the end of all of this, you\u2019d like to go back- I would not stop you. But only after Father has come and taken care of these men who wish to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d says Sansa, before Ghost leaps at Jon and bears him down to the ground, before Lady gnaws through Jon\u2019s scabbard and divests him of half his weaponry, \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>While he\u2019s still disoriented, Sansa tosses the keys he\u2019d used to unlock the gates past the first one and then cuts the weight holding the winching gears back. Jon goes rigid when he hears the thunk of the heavy steel door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you-\u201d he spits, when he gets Lady\u2019s tail whipping straight into his face, \u201c-what- what\u2019re you <i>do-\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving your life,\u201d Sansa replies, evenly. </p><p>She belts his scabbard over her own waist. It settles easily enough, but is too tight for a second loop and too loose for just one. After a shrug, she slides it over her head so it rests at a diagonal: one part of the strap at her shoulder, another at her hip. It digs into her skin, but it\u2019s the best compromise she currently has.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jon hisses. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to-\u201d One of the direwolves barrels into him; Jon grunts and stumbles forwards. \u201cOur deal is <i>finished.</i> You cannot demand more of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a deal,\u201d Sansa says. \u201cI never thought of it as one. This is not a debt you are paying me, nor a deal we struck with swords in the woods.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen what is this?\u201d he demands. </p><p>She thinks of Willam, sitting beside her, silvered and shining. She thinks of his words: <i>There are debts between people, yes, often, but the world is not all of that. There is love as well.</i> She swallows. \u201cCall it whatever you want. But I am your sister, and I will not let you die for the foolishness of your pride.\u201d</p><p>He bristles. \u201cMy honor is-\u201d</p><p>Sansa reaches forwards and catches his hand, blindly, because she\u2019s looking into his eyes, because she knows Jon will believe this, even if he doesn\u2019t believe that she is real.</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d she says. \u201cThe dead are coming, and I can defeat them, and I ca- I <i>will-</i> do it alone but- could you live with yourself?\u201d Jon stares at her. \u201cIf I defeated them and you could have been beside me but weren\u2019t, because you were afraid?\u201d Sansa remembers Lyarra\u2019s cold, cold hands on the back of her neck, the chill that\u2019s offered her more comfort than almost anything else in her life. \u201cThey say that Bran and Rickon are alive, Jon. That they\u2019re beyond the Wall, and alive, and safe.\u201d A moment to catch her breath, and then she adds the last sentence, soft and gentle and all-shaking as an avalanche. \u201cHonor is important, yes, but the world is more important than one man\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>Jon tears his hands away from her and stumbles away. \u201cThese are vows I\u2019ve sworn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are people relying on me.\u201d</p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t move. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather would want me to honor what I\u2019ve sworn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather would want you to honor your duties to your family,\u201d Sansa says, harsher than she\u2019d expected the words to sound. The lie still tastes bitter on her tongue: <i>father, father, father.</i> \u201cAnd I swear to you, your familial duties lie here, not behind that Wall.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, not for very long at all; Jon bows his head and Sansa presses her hands together to keep from picking at her nails. Then he lifts his head and-</p><p>And he looks like an old, old hero, from one of those old tales. Not a Targaryen knight. Not a King of Winter. There\u2019s a tapestry hidden beside one of the crypts that Torrhen had shown her, once, parchment-thin and crumbly as old leaf, with a man\u2019s profile sketched in large, broad swathes. </p><p>It\u2019s faded. </p><p>It\u2019s glorious.</p><p>That\u2019s what Jon looks like, Sansa thinks. Old worries on a young face, beauty on bones that weren\u2019t built to carry them, strength dug up out of salt and snow and somehow still rooted deep. She wants to shrink away from the depths of the emotions she feels upon seeing his face; she wants to reach out and embrace it, let it burn her until she is nothing but ashes.</p><p><i>Targaryen,</i> a voice breathes into her ear, and she realizes- Visenya. He is Visenya, but younger, but tempered, but more loved than Visenya has ever known in centuries of either life or death. <i>Stark,</i> too, as Stark as Arya, who\u2019d been loved and adored for all she\u2019d never obeyed anyone\u2019s orders, but brighter, but uglier.</p><p>\u201cGive me my sword,\u201d says Jon, and the spell shatters as if someone had struck it with a hammer. </p><p>Sansa shudders back to life. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, a little numbly. \u201cYes, I will- do that.\u201d</p><p><i>Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. </i>She cannot breathe for the weight of the lies, none of them hers. There are tears in her eyes, and Sansa bites them back until her throat aches. <i>You have brought something into this world that is more terrible than you could have ever thought.</i></p><p>Jon hesitates, and then he firms his shoulders. \u201cWhich direction are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They walk for hours.</p><p>It is strange, to be with someone whose needs must be met- Sansa has gotten used to the dead, who are tireless and limited only by the boundaries they can cross. But Jon must eat and drink and sleep, so they trade watches, and divide the food as evenly as they can. </p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t realize that Jon doesn\u2019t believe her. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t, though- not until almost a sennight after they set out.</p><p>They\u2019re pitching their camp, and Sansa\u2019s stirring the fire with a knobbly stick while Jon returns with enough wood to keep the fire going through the night. There\u2019s dried berries and the remains of a snow hare for dinner; Sansa feels nausea dig into her, so she hums a little ditty to herself. </p><p>It isn\u2019t much. Just a little girl\u2019s rendition of the sea shanties that Theon Stark had taught her, which were two octaves lower than her own voice. Barely audible, even to herself.</p><p>Jon, across the camp, hearing her over the crackle of the fire, stills. He mumbles something into the wood.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d asks Sansa.</p><p>He turns to her. And Jon\u2019s eyes- Sansa hasn\u2019t ever seen them like that before, liquid-bright and hot with something that could have been either horror or ecstasy. \u201cDo that again,\u201d he whispers, \u201cthat- song. The humming.\u201d</p><p>One up, three down, each note sharper than any sea shanty would ever be, but carrying its same rhythm. Sansa eyes Jon suspiciously but sings nevertheless.</p><p>Jon\u2019s face can\u2019t seem to decide what it feels. He pales further, until he looks like a half-ghost. Then he says, \u201cSa-\u201d his voice breaks, picking up momentum a breath later, \u201cSansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She flattens her hands on the fabric covering her knees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought- I\u2019d forgotten that- oh, gods.\u201d He sits down on the ground, right there, looking sick and joyous all at once. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sansa says slowly. \u201cI am myself. Is something the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t-\u201d Jon looks as white as a ghost. \u201cI thought you were some- something else. A- a story Old Nan hadn\u2019t remembered to tell us.\u201d</p><p>Sansa lifts an eyebrow. \u201cAnd that was more believable to you than me being myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t-\u201d he gestures violently, before reaching up to scrub through his hair. \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to <i>be</i> like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty.\u201d His eyes narrow on her, and Sansa feels her amusement rise to match his annoyance. \u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>She keeps her face as blank as she can make it, though her lips certainly twitch. \u201cBeing trained by a woman who conquered an entire continent has the ability to change a lot of things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou were not trained by Visenya Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas so.\u201d Sansa leans back, eyes wide and innocent. \u201cDid you know that she hates our grandfather?\u201d</p><p>Jon sputters. \u201cYou did <i>not</i> speak to our grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a tall man.\u201d She gnaws on the inside of her cheek to still her smile, though she can\u2019t quite hide it entirely. \u201cGrumpy, too. I see where you get it from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d he sighs.</p><p><i>\u201cJon,\u201d</i> she mimics, before dropping the amusement. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult to imagine. But you\u2019ve seen the dead- the actual <i>dead-</i> and the Night\u2019s King. Do you think me being able to see ghosts is so very different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says plainly. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to think the old stories are true. It\u2019s another to think that my sister\u2019s been lying to me for her entire life. Lying to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Sansa folds her hands over her lap. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because that would have gone over so well with Mother and Father,\u201d Sansa says flatly. \u201cOh, yes, I\u2019ve sown all the samplers you want, Mother, I\u2019ve done the letters you want, Father, and, by the way, I had a <i>fascinating</i> conversation with Torrhen Stark on how his daughter planted the first blue roses in Winterfell, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t fall asleep the way Arya did this afternoon!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s shouting by the end. Her eyes burn, just a little, but she pushes it away in favor of gripping her wrists tightly.</p><p>\u201cFather would have-\u201d Jon exhales, whistling it out through his teeth, \u201c-I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d have done, because this is- this is- so strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you understand,\u201d Sansa says.</p><p>Jon moves closer to her, slowly, hesitantly- he raises his hand as if he means to draw her into an embrace, and then he drops it to cuff her shoulder instead. \u201cI know that they love you. Your mother might not have\u2026\u201d he trails off, awkwardly, before settling against the log, back against her shins. \u201cLiked me, all that much. But she\u2019s always loved you, all of you. Arya at her brattiest. Robb at his angriest. You remember how much she yelled at Bran?\u201d</p><p>For weeks on end. Sansa remembers: her mother rigid with anger and worry, Bran limber and long-limbed. Every morning for two years, they\u2019d been woken by Catelyn yelling at Bran for climbing; so much it had become a routine, and still Bran had never thought she didn\u2019t love him. </p><p>Even in King\u2019s Landing- nobody, not a single soul, had ever doubted in Catelyn Stark\u2019s love for her children. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Sansa, soundless.</p><p>\u201cWe would have understood.\u201d He huffs a laugh. \u201cOr tried. We would have tried our best, at the least.\u201d</p><p>Sansa curls over her hands, hunching against the cold. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>I don\u2019t trust you, </i>thinks Sansa, hands cold, heart colder. <i>I don\u2019t believe you.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHow did you realize it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose songs. Nobody else ever liked them enough to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew I was myself because I sang a sea shanty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were yourself because nobody else could have sung it that badly.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cJon!\u201d</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>A week later, Sansa wakes to find a third wolf in their midst.</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d breathes Jon. </p><p>Sansa snaps her head towards him. \u201cThey\u2019re alive. Bran and Rickon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe them?\u201d Jon asks. \u201cYour ghosts-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t certain.\u201d She runs her fingers down Summer\u2019s dark fur. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be certain. There\u2019s been so many lies, you know- secrets, forgotten truths- I haven\u2019t trusted anyone. In a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for me,\u201d says Jon.</p><p>Then he seems to understand what Sansa\u2019s averted face means: Jon flinches as if she\u2019s struck him, and he steps forwards to look at her closer. </p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d he says.</p><p>She tilts her head up to meet his gaze. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s fault,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I <i>can,</i> anymore. Or if I ever could. I never really even considered telling anyone about how I could see ghosts, and that was before Rickard and Visenya\u2026 drove that point home.\u201d</p><p>Jon looks horrified for a long minute, but then he scoffs- scoffs and drops to sit next to her, looking vaguely irritated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cTrust isn\u2019t something that\u2019s- that\u2019s like hair color, or your height, or anything like that. It\u2019s not something you\u2019re born with. It- it certainly isn\u2019t your fault, Sansa, if people thought the truth was too dangerous to tell others.\u201d He turns, and eyes- Father\u2019s eyes- pierce through all of Sansa\u2019s shields, leave her open and bare and armorless. \u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault that people gave you secrets to hold.\u201d</p><p><i>This, </i>Sansa thinks contemplatively,<i> is the happiest I\u2019ve felt in years.</i></p><p>She\u2019s hungry, cold, lonely. She\u2019s never even imagined that her family might try to accept her for who she is- never even allowed that hope to materialize. Sansa swallows, and rises to her feet, and when she turns to help Jon to his feet, she pulls him into a hug as well.</p><p>He\u2019s so warm.</p><p>(Sansa\u2019s tears are soft things, born of Minisa and the giving, fertile loam of the Riverlands. But now- her tears are cold, sharp; they burn down her face like ice cracking the earth open. Sansa doesn\u2019t regret the pain at all.</p><p>They\u2019re tears of joy.)</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Summer leads them.</p><p>Sansa can\u2019t find it in herself to breathe, but somehow she manages. Somehow, she keeps herself moving: one foot after the other, one breath in after another, hope and fear swirling in her wake like footprints embedded in snow. </p><p>Bran\u2019s <i>alive,</i> and Sansa\u2019s near him- so close- they\u2019ll be together again.</p><p>Them. Their family. In a snow-ridden wasteland, hurt, so close to being cleaved apart.</p><p>But together.</p><p><i>The pack survives.</i> Sansa keeps walking, Jon beside her, head up as if scenting the wind. They are not wolves, not truly; but right then, Sansa thinks she\u2019ll shred anyone who tries to keep her from Bran to pieces. Right then, she cannot imagine that she is fangless, clawless. <i>I have been alone for too long.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>They emerge, three direwolves and two fur-bundled humans, into the middle of a dark clearing. </p><p>There are numerous people there.</p><p>There is only one person that Sansa cares about. She rises to her toes, straining for a glimpse of-</p><p>\u201cBran,\u201d whispers Sansa, at the shine of his red hair.</p><p>It\u2019s strange: Sansa is the slower of them, between her, and the direwolves, and Jon.</p><p>Perhaps there are wings that grow on her feet. Perhaps the wind aids her. Perhaps it\u2019s love, that gives her the speed to move so quickly. She feels something similar to it, at least: like solid flesh and blood has been replaced, for just a breath, with wind and ice.</p><p>Because she reaches Bran before Jon.</p><p>Bran, who is alive under her arms, who is warm and grown larger than the comatose figure she\u2019d last seen, who is <i>alive,</i> as she hasn\u2019t dreamt possible for months.</p><p>Then Jon is there, and he\u2019s holding onto Bran just as tightly, likely leaving bruises on both of their shoulders- but Sansa doesn\u2019t care. She couldn\u2019t possibly care about anything, not with her brothers beside her, safe and alive and in her arms.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They finally settle in a cave a little distant from the clearing Summer had led them to. It\u2019s large and dark, but dry; and when one of the others lights a match, Sansa realizes that they aren\u2019t wildlings at all. </p><p>Jon starts swearing when he finally sees the same thing. </p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t enemies,\u201d says Bran quietly, when he finally deciphers what both of their sputtering means. \u201cThey\u2019re- they saved my life. We were running, Meera and Jojen and I, and would\u2019ve been caught without Leaf\u2019s help. She brought us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran-\u201d</p><p>Sansa looks at them- the crowd that had allowed Bran to so much as meet them outside, for they\u2019d been the ones to wheel him out, certainly- and tries to pick out what, exactly, is leaving her so unnerved. Perhaps it\u2019s the features, which are so similar to her own and yet alien; perhaps it\u2019s the eyes, which are large and slitted as a cat. Perhaps it\u2019s the grace with which they move, too swift and curving for any human.</p><p>But Sansa\u2019s known ghosts for long enough to push past the initial terror, to search for the ground on which a bond can grow, so she tilts her head back at Bran.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d she asks, just as lowly.</p><p>He nods. </p><p>There\u2019s no hesitation there at all, and it\u2019s that which makes her mind up, more than anything else. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>He jerks his head irritably at her. Sansa ignores him, and gets up, moving slowly towards the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sansa,\u201d she says, when she\u2019s close enough for them to know that she\u2019s addressing them, when it\u2019s unmistakable. \u201cBran\u2019s sister. And this is Jon- he\u2019s our brother. We\u2026 we\u2019re here to help. Jon\u2019s spent years fighting the dead. He\u2019ll be invaluable to you.\u201d</p><p>One of the Children steps forwards slowly. \u201cWe have not the numbers for fighting,\u201d they say, in a voice that rolls over Sansa\u2019s skin like thunder. \u201cAnd less of the will. What use have we for a commander with no forces to command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak not for others,\u201d advises another of the Children, \u201conly for yourself.\u201d</p><p>A third one, with a voice that\u2019s high and sweet, says, \u201cI see you, sister of Bran.\u201d</p><p>Everyone falls silent at that. Behind her, Sansa can hear Bran inhale sharply. But nobody seems willing to elaborate on the statement, not until a child steps out of the crowd. It\u2019s too dark to make out much of their face.</p><p>\u201cYou shine almost as bright as the Crow,\u201d she says slowly, deliberately. \u201cYour brother has the potential to, and it shines as sparks off a stone in his chest. But you? Oh, you shed the light in your wake. His potential is realized in you, all without a weirwood to ground it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Sansa. She watches, numbly, as the child raises one hand to almost brush over her chest.</p><p>Then she feels someone dragging her backwards, and before she can blink, she\u2019s set behind Jon- who\u2019s standing in front of her with his shoulders thrown back, his legs spread as if to take a blow. \u201cStay back,\u201d he growls.</p><p>Bran reaches up and grips Sansa\u2019s wrist, dragging her attention back to him. \u201cShe\u2019s blind,\u201d he whispers. \u201cShe can see magic. Only magic. She\u2019s very old, and-\u201d</p><p>Sansa looks up, and sees the child tilt her head at Jon. Sees her say, \u201cOh, fire and ice. Alone they are common enough, but together? There are things that ought not to be in this world. You are one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d says Bran, and it\u2019s authoritative enough that they all fall silent. Even Jon stops bristling enough to be surprised that he\u2019s listening to Bran; Sansa\u2019s surprised enough, because she remembers how quiet he\u2019d been. Those months of watching Robb lead must have affected him in some manner though, and if this is it, she\u2019ll take it and be glad. \u201cPerhaps we can-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Crow will wish to see her,\u201d says the child. \u201cAnd him, I suppose, if for nothing more than the fire.\u201d</p><p>Bran nods as if her words make sense. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>They arrive at a weirwood tree. The hall is well-lit, which is why Sansa can see the man sitting atop a seat made of the weirwood roots- he\u2019s pale and gaunt, save for a patchy rash running from the side of his neck up to his cheekbone. Fine, thin strands of silvery hair are in disarray around him.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Sansa asks carefully.</p><p>He tilts his head to her, but doesn\u2019t speak for a long minute. Sansa wonders if he\u2019s even going to answer- but then he does.</p><p>\u201cI am the three-eyed Crow,\u201d he says, voice hoarse and rasping. It makes Sansa want to shiver out of her skin, the unearthly scrape of it. \u201cBut I was not always this. Perhaps you have heard of a lord named Brynden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynden Waters,\u201d breathes Sansa. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says the man- Brynden, Brynden Waters, the person she\u2019s been charged with meeting by her grandmother and Visenya, two people who\u2019d likely never agree on anything else from this to the end of time. \u201cYou know of me, then.\u201d</p><p>Hands shaking, Sansa undoes her scabbard and removes Dark Sister. </p><p>\u201cYou would know this blade,\u201d she says. </p><p>He laughs. \u201cI would know that blade even if I\u2019d not seen it in half a thousand dreams. How came a Stark by Dark Sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Visenya\u2019s own tutelage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not tutor often,\u201d says Brynden, voice turning even slower, ponderous. \u201cThose she takes an interest in are great, always, no matter whether they are terrible or wonderful. It is a gift that she has, my many-times grandmother. To find the best and know them, even when they do not know it themselves. Tell me, daughter of House Stark: what would drive a girl with Visenya\u2019s stamp to come this far north?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead,\u201d says Sansa, swallowing. \u201cAs it drove you, once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to the Wall because I did not wish to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you crossed it because there was something happening, and you wished to know what it was.\u201d Sansa juts her chin upwards. \u201cI know that the dead are there. My brother- Jon- has fought against armies of them. Legions. Ghosts that have never feared for anything in their entire existence are shivering, timorous beings. And I know that I can help against them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d asks Brynden, slowly shifting forwards, like a tree bending in a strong gale. \u201cTell me what you will do.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stares into his lone, red eye. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. Jon makes an aborted sound behind her; she ignores him. \u201cBut you do.\u201d</p><p>Again, there\u2019s silence. This time, it doesn\u2019t stay silent, not for Sansa. Her heartbeat echoes and echoes against her ears, thundering like a drum. She\u2019s gambled so much on three words. If she\u2019s wrong- if her grandmother, if her grandfather- are wrong- </p><p>Death will be the least of her worries.</p><p>But then, Brynden Waters nods. Short, shaky; but a nod nevertheless.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is a long tale. And to appreciate it properly, you shall need- need to know more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of what?\u201d asks Sansa sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the final secret of your house, Sansa Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him,\u201d says Bran, who\u2019s seated beside her. His eyes are glowing, in the dim light. It looks so strange. \u201cHe knows it already, Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Sansa says, \u201cThere was a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Brynden, softly. \u201cThere was.\u201d Then, a little more briskly: \u201cTake rest for now. Sleep, eat; the Children shall help you. And tonight, they shall tell you a story. It will answer some of your questions, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t speak again. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>That night, Sansa\u2019s seated besides Jon in an enormous cavern. She\u2019s eaten some sort of a stew; it\u2019s not very filling, but is very warm, so she\u2019s rather grateful for it anyhow. Then the quiet movements around her still- people seat themselves, settle in as always for stories, the same way people would do in Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall.</p><p>The Children whisper amongst each other, a gentle susurration of sound. Sansa waits.</p><p>Finally, a woman steps forward- or, Sansa thinks it\u2019s a woman; she has more delicate features than some of the others, and a slightly higher voice- and she speaks, words accented strangely.</p><p>\u201cI remember a time millennia past,\u201d she says, \u201cthat you cannot possibly imagine. Things of wonder and horror and magic.\u201d She pauses, and her green eyes glow brighter. \u201cYou have said that you know of the Pact. For years after signing it, we had peace. Many of our number did not think it possible- that your people could ever honor something when they loved its opposite so dearly, for not a single year went by without war of some sort. But you managed to hold the treaty for centuries. And then you came for our forests.\u201d</p><p>Another child says something, cutting her off. They sound irritable, or perhaps reprimanding; the one who\u2019d spoken responds sharply and they fall into an argument that slithers around Sansa\u2019s ears as so many snakes.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain-\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d </i>Sansa replies, hissing, into Jon\u2019s ear. Yes, she is certain this is necessary. Not a good idea, perhaps. Not a safe idea, perhaps. But these people haven\u2019t hurt Bran in the weeks that he\u2019s been with them, and she also knows full well how it feels to have a person- a real, live person, with even the slightest bit of power- ask for an explanation without ulterior motives. They want to tell her this story. It might not be easy, but- she can feel its importance already, in the way the words trip up her spine like so many warmed stones.</p><p>Finally, the child who\u2019d spoken returns her attention to them. \u201cMy- companion-\u201d she says, in a voice that lets Sansa know how this admission galls her, \u201c-wishes you to know that your people\u2019s greed was not all of it. There were offerings given, and treaties struck, and we responded to a few cases of greed with overmuch zeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfferings?\u201d Jon inquires. </p><p>He could sound more polite, but he could also sound far less. Sansa decides to cut her losses instead of snapping at him.</p><p>\u201cOf wool, and silks, and meat that dwells in flatlands that we hadn\u2019t access to for years.\u201d The child shrugs. \u201cYou wished for wood, and we offered that in return for all of those things. But some men took more than they gave. When we went to your kings\u2026 they did not hear us. They did not listen.\u201d She lowers her voice, until it sounds like the wind\u2019s rasp through a tree\u2019s leaves. \u201cOne of the proudest, one of the greatest, was Brandon Builder. We do not have kings, did not have them even when our numbers rivalled your own- but we saw through the trees and realized you would not listen if we sent one of us alone to you. So we sang a child out of the mud, each one of us giving him a gift of our own. And we sent him to your king, this child of the Children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what he said?\u201d another child asks. This one has a rounder face, sharper cheekbones; he looks younger than the first one. \u201cBrandon Builder, your thousand-times forefather- he refused to hear us. And when our child returned, he called us together for war.\u201d</p><p>The first one continues: \u201cThe child was not the proper answer to our problems. We had wished to ready him for kings, and in doing so we made him too proud. Too vengeful. He led us into a war we were not ready for, for reasons none of us knew save for injured pride and revenge.\u201d She snorts. \u201cThe first act of the war was our last.\u201d</p><p><i>One act, </i>Sansa thinks, fingers drumming against her thigh.<i> One act, so terrible it destroyed an entire race.</i></p><p>\u201cBrandon Builder had one daughter,\u201d says the second child. </p><p>Jon shakes his head almost immediately. \u201cHe had only sons,\u201d he challenges. \u201cThree sons, and no daughters. If there\u2019s one thing everyone agrees upon-\u201d</p><p><i>The first truth,</i> Sansa thinks, a chill gripping her bones. <i>The oldest Stark truth: there was a daughter.</i></p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says, reaching out to grip his elbow, eyes affixed to the children. \u201cJust- listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had five sons,\u201d whispers the first child. \u201cI know it well, Stark-son. I was there for it all. He had five sons: one heir and another with arrows sharp as dragonglass and another with a tongue even sharper and another with eyes bright as a sunrise and another with a gift for crafting that even his father did not have; and one daughter: her name was-\u201d she says something, a long, liquid stream of syllables that makes Sansa shiver; it slips out of her mind almost immediately, however, and for all that she tries, she cannot remember it. </p><p>She smiles thinly. \u201cYou will not remember her name. Only those who knew her before she- she became what she is now, can know it. We sacrificed that in the name of our vengeance.\u201d</p><p>Jon turns his head towards Sansa, creakingly slowly. There\u2019s an old terror in his eyes, and she finds herself reaching forwards, slotting her fingers through his. </p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Sansa asks, quietly. <i>How do you unmake a name? How is that</i> possible?</p><p>\u201cThe child that we made- he was made, you see. Until him- Children appeared. We are of the trees and the streams, and when the magic is enough we are formed, whole. That is how I came, from a poplar tree; that is how-\u201d another string of syllables that Sansa could not pronounce, though this one stays in her mind, \u201c-came, from a stone rounded at the bend of a river. It is how we all come. Until we made <i>him,</i> and though he looked and spoke and sang as if one of us, he did not have what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContentment.\u201d She reaches forwards and the trees before her burst into flowers- greenish rim, with a scarlet middle. Poplar flowers. \u201cWhen the land has enough, it is contented. It is not <i>greedy.</i> But he did not have that in him, though he had enough to know what he did not have.\u201d</p><p>Jon lifts one eyebrow. \u201cHumans can be greedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this kind of greedy. The kind where you have nothing inside of you, where there is a coldness within in the place of a soul. He wanted. And so he took, and named it vengeance so we would follow him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe formed the Others, then,\u201d Sansa says, with certainty. Horror is there, yes, but the world seems to thrum above that, a drum-beat in echo with her heart. This is important, and a history that ought to be known. \u201cHe cut souls out of other- people, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>The first child closes her hand into a fist, and the poplar flowers shrivel. \u201cWe stole Brandon Builder\u2019s daughter. And we watched as he did it- as he transferred her soul into his body. But souls are not meant to be cut out like that, nor to be touched by mortal hands. It was not a good job- he left pieces behind in her, of her soul, could not do enough. He was vaporized- the world caved in around us. We all nearly died. And the Night\u2019s Queen was formed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon Builder raged.\u201d The other child\u2019s voice rustles, like water, like waves. She sounds empty. \u201cShe was beautiful and terrible and there was nothing that we could do against her. So we went to him, and Brandon Builder killed our envoys, led an army of a hundred thousand into our forests and cut us down where we slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Night\u2019s Queen killed us for the emptiness of her soul, and Brandon Builder killed us for our cruelty. At first she fed on Children alone; but when humans came too close, she had few compunctions about killing them as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe killed two of her brothers,\u201d says the second child. \u201cThe heir, and the crafter. They who had tried to bring back their sister died before even uttering a word, and finally, still mourning, Brandon Builder called his people together and built a monument that still lasts to this day.\u201d</p><p><i>What in the world-</i></p><p>\u201cThe Wall,\u201d whispers Jon.</p><p>The Children hiss angrily at the word. It takes Sansa a moment to understand, because- well, they\u2019ve not understood anything Sansa and Jon have said in the entire conversation; or at least they\u2019ve pretended not to- but this word, this single word- it\u2019s not in the Old Tongue, but the children know it.</p><p><i>Wall, </i>thinks Sansa. The word they use now recalls the structure that Brandon built. It is, perhaps, the oldest word in their language.</p><p>The first child inclines her head slowly. \u201cEight thousand years later, and we still cannot approach it. The magic woven into it- it\u2019s something that repels us. We cannot cross it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so,\u201d Jon says flatly, \u201cyou died out.\u201d</p><p>The second folds her hands together. \u201cEven so. The last great thing we did was to erase her from history. Her name is gone. No longer can it remain in memory or writing, save for those who were alive and knew it before the spell was cast. And year by year, that number lessens. Until all those left are those before you now, whittled down to tens that once numbered millions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d whispers Sansa.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d says the first child, \u201cyou asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA name gives power,\u201d says the second child. \u201cQuiet power. Still power. But power nonetheless. Why do you think you name your sons Brandon? Because there is a power to it, one that you know but cannot understand. The Night\u2019s Queen\u2019s father knew this, and didn\u2019t wish for it to happen. He had lost almost everything to us. Two sons, his sole daughter; the peace he\u2019d fought for all his life. And he came to us and asked us for one boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hollow boon, perhaps, but a boon nevertheless.\u201d The first child smiles, ghastly. \u201cWe gave it to him. You know what we called it, when we did? <i>The highest kindness.</i> The best apology we could make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it enough?\u201d asks Jon.</p><p>Sansa knows the answer before ever the Children speak. How can it ever be enough? Life for a life is unequal, always. One life can never be matched by another. Hundreds? Thousands? It is like asking which is more devastating: the tides, or the floods. Each, in its own way. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says the first child. \u201cBut we tried.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a scraping sound from the weirwood throne- Sansa jerks her head up and looks at Brynden Waters, whom she\u2019d forgotten existed, while listening to the story.</p><p>\u201cYou asked what you can do, Sansa Stark,\u201d he says, scrapingly slowly. \u201cAnd this is your answer: you are the latest descendant of this house, which has scarred this land immeasurably.

It&rsquo;s weird, but so&rsquo;s my brain!</b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://dialux.tumblr.com/tagged/a-tempest%3B-a-cyclone\" target=\"_blank\">Previous chapters can be found here.</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Four: she wears fire for skin but a storm lives in her soul</b><br /></p><p>Snow is seeping into Sansa&rsquo;s clothes. </p><p>She refuses to move, however, and even less to give away her position. There can be no mistakes made now: Sansa <i>must</i> succeed, for the price of failure is too great to contemplate, much less allow.</p><p>Lady- Sansa can sense her, vaguely, off behind the small bush she&rsquo;s hidden behind. She&rsquo;d yipped some time previous, but the silence now makes her feel wary. Their prey approaches, and Sansa must be fast enough to strike, quick enough to do so without letting him attack her in return.</p><p>And then she hears, distantly, the snap of a twig.</p><p>Dark Sister is perfectly balanced in one hand. Sansa shifts her weight from one leg to another, then back, ensuring she&rsquo;s ready to jump out. She breathes in, slowly, and Ghost bounds into the clearing.</p><p>Not a few minutes later, so does Jon.</p><p>Her breath catches.</p><p>He&rsquo;s older than she remembers; his hair is raggeder, and there&rsquo;s a stiffness to his shoulders that Sansa hasn&rsquo;t seen before. If anything, Jon&rsquo;s grown to look even more like their father.</p><p><i>My father. </i>The truth tastes like ashes in her mouth. <i>Jon&rsquo;s uncle.</i></p><p>&ldquo;What was so important, boy?&rdquo; Jon demands of Ghost, pressing his hands to his knees and panting. &ldquo;That you had to-&rdquo; he straightens, abruptly, and half-draws his sword out of the scabbard, turning to the shadows exactly opposite to Sansa, from which a soft noise has come. &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s there&hellip;&rdquo; His voice sounds menacing. </p><p>Lady pads out of the darkness, and Sansa makes full use of Jon&rsquo;s momentary distraction to start moving forwards.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady?&rdquo; asks Jon, almost reaching out to touch her. &ldquo;You survived? I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo; he swallows, hard. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d died.&rdquo;</p><p>She should keep silent, according to the very plan that she&rsquo;d hashed out last night- hit Jon over the head, and let him wake up after that, bound so he&rsquo;s forced to listen to her words. But seeing the way Jon&rsquo;s hands tremble, as if a strong wind had blown between the spaces of his fingers- Sansa cannot. The weight of a hundred worlds could have borne down on her &nbsp;tongue, and it would not have mattered.</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says Sansa, softly. He goes stiff about the shoulders. &ldquo;And neither did I.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon whirls around, and Sansa has all of a heartbeat to realize that he&rsquo;s not been calmed by seeing Lady; he&rsquo;s palmed a knife instead, one that he uses to slash at Sansa&rsquo;s arm. She stumbles back, sleeve ripping, and Jon uses the moment to draw his sword.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you?&rdquo; he asks, eyes narrowing on her.</p><p>Sansa smiles tremulously. &ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to talk, you&rsquo;ll drop that sword.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t soften, not even a little, and Sansa feels her heart stumble a little. Her mother, her father- they wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized her, would they? She&rsquo;s changed so much that-</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she says, struggling to keep her voice even, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you think-&rdquo;</p><p>Her words are cut off when Jon releases a flurry of blows at her, half of which she catches as a matter of habit and the other half of which she deflects by sheer chance. His hands tighten further on his sword&rsquo;s hilt and Sansa takes two large steps backwards, her lungs aching.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Sansa,&rdquo;</i> she snaps breathlessly. &ldquo;You absolute moron, it&rsquo;s <i>me,</i> stop fighting-&rdquo;</p><p>Jon laughs. Then he says, &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s in King&rsquo;s Landing. If you want to lie to me, try to do better than that.&rdquo;</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t want to do this. Listen to me, you utter buffoon!</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying,&rdquo; says Sansa, fright and irritation melding together into a strange amalgam in her chest to produce an even stranger voice. &ldquo;Listen, I need you to <i>listen-&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; replies Jon, and spins neatly to catch her across her underarm. </p><p>Sansa ducks away, a shriek caught in her throat.</p><p>(Sansa&rsquo;s always prepared. </p><p>This is one thing that everyone seems to forget about her: she&rsquo;s never had as native a skill at sewing as everyone seems to assume, but once she realized how important it was for ladies- Sansa&rsquo;d spent nights and mornings and every spare moment of her time sawing that needle through the cloth until it resembled the primers they&rsquo;d been given. </p><p>Everyone always forgets that. </p><p>Jon Snow is not an exception.)</p><p>(Now, here&rsquo;s a tale that hasn&rsquo;t been told:</p><p>When Sansa forgave Elia, there was a scrap of silver that Elia let fall into the sand, far below them both. Elia, Elia, Elia Martell: of Nymeria and Mors, daughter of Arianne, with the sun&rsquo;s sparks sunk deep into her bones. That silver that fell- it burned and blistered the sand, and when Sansa ran over it hours later it remained hot to the touch, blazing even through the soles of her sandals.</p><p>Sansa wrapped it up in cloth soaked in saltwater and remembered grief, and took it with her North.)</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Sansa ducks away, a shriek building in her throat, and when Jon finishes the spin, turning to meet her, she throws one fistful of sand-embers straight into his face. He backs away, clawing at his eyes. She doesn&rsquo;t hesitate at that- if there&rsquo;s one thing she&rsquo;s learned from Visenya it&rsquo;s <i>do not pause.</i> Not for pain, not for love, not once you&rsquo;ve set upon a course. </p><p>With all the grace of a barreling ox, Sansa brings Dark Sister&rsquo;s hilt down on the side of Jon&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>She goes to get some of the melted snow from her camp, a ways away from where she&rsquo;d decided to confront Jon. There&rsquo;s little chance of Jon escaping, but Sansa&rsquo;s bound his hands and removed both his sword and the visible daggers anyhow. Lugging the water back leaves red marks along her palms- Sansa grits her teeth and bears through the pain.</p><p>He&rsquo;s awake and half-escaped the ropes Sansa&rsquo;d tied him up with when she returns.</p><p>&ldquo;Gods <i>above,&rdquo;</i> Sansa says, driving the bucket into the snow with one sharp motion. &ldquo;If you continue to do that, I&rsquo;ll- I&rsquo;ll dump this water on you, see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon freezes, before slowly relaxing. &ldquo;This is a dream,&rdquo; he mutters to himself. The confusion on his face softens Sansa&rsquo;s ire, just enough for her to seat herself in front of him. </p><p>&ldquo;You dream of me often?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Which is why this is so- surprising.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon.&rdquo; He looks up at the tone of her voice, at the abrupt intensity. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a dream. There are things I must tell you- necessary things. Dangerous things. Important things. You have to <i>listen,</i> not run away, not ignore me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what is so important?&rdquo; asks Jon, lifting one brow. </p><p>&ldquo;To start out with-&rdquo; Sansa shifts uneasily, &ldquo;-you&rsquo;re in danger. People want to kill you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p><p>Her hand spasms around her knee. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shrugs his shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in danger ever since I left Winterfell. I don&rsquo;t need any apparition from the gods to remind me of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not </i>an apparition from any god!&rdquo; Sansa springs to her feet, the surge of emotion in her belly making it impossible to remain seated. </p><p>She sucks on her teeth in a vain attempt to stop looking at the melted water. It&rsquo;s supposed to be used to wash the mud from her hair and prove, finally, unequivocally, that she is who she says she is. But it would feel so good to just throw it on Jon and his stupid, stubborn face.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me one good reason, then,&rdquo; says Jon, &ldquo;why Sansa Stark would be here at the Wall. Start with how- how she left King&rsquo;s Landing, and then with how she survived the trek all the way here, and then with how she came to have- is that <i>mud</i> on your hair?- short hair, and- and a fucking sword!&rdquo; He pauses, breathing heavily, before continuing even louder: &ldquo;A sword! That she knows how to use! You tell me who&rsquo;d have taught her, and then how she got Ghost to bring me out of the castle, and why, out of all the bloody castles in all the world, she&rsquo;d choose this one! Answer that and <i>yes,</i> then I might believe you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look like her?&rdquo; Sansa asks. She&rsquo;s aiming for levity, but it falls flat; it sounds too strained, and she has to hide her flinch at both the wound she&rsquo;s revealed as well as the thin sound of her voice.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Jon, scornfully. &ldquo;If she ever dressed up as an urchin it&rsquo;d not last longer than one afternoon. The mud would be too much for Sansa, I think, more than even the hunger.&rdquo;</p><p><i>What a terrible thing, </i>Sansa thinks distantly, <i>to hear the truth.</i></p><p>But she has her pride, now, along with her love and fear and anger. So she only lifts her chin and smiles and makes sure- with enough ferocity to make even a Targaryen quail- that the smile doesn&rsquo;t wobble.</p><p>&ldquo;I left King&rsquo;s Landing through the kitchens.&rdquo; One breath to keep her voice even, and a second to keep her eyes level, and the third is for no reason other than that she wants it. &ldquo;I cut my hair and burned it before I left. It wasn&rsquo;t so difficult, in all honesty: nobody expected that I&rsquo;d escape on my own, and less that I&rsquo;d escape disguised as a boy.&rdquo; <i>Not even you, brother mine.</i> &ldquo;I stole some food, and some clothes, but not from people who couldn&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the sword?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well. That comes to who taught me, and you&rsquo;d not believe that if you don&rsquo;t believe the rest of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon leans forwards. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say I believe you, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon-&rdquo; Sansa says, slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to tell me the story.&rdquo; His eyes are glittering, hard and unyielding. This is not the brother Sansa knows; this is the Lord Commander that the Night&rsquo;s Watch has elected. &ldquo;So tell it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s name is Dark Sister.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a moment&rsquo;s pause, and then Jon realizes where he&rsquo;s heard that name. His eyes dip to the sword, and then rise to meet hers, incredulous. </p><p>&ldquo;Made of Valyrian steel,&rdquo; Sansa continues, when he keeps silent. &ldquo;Its first owner gave it to me. And she was the one to teach me swordfighting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The first owner was-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Visenya.&rdquo; She inclines her head. &ldquo;Of House Targaryen.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s jaw is slack. He keeps staring at the sword and then back to her. After a moment- he hisses out through his teeth, a sound so derisive it catches in her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I can see ghosts,&rdquo; Sansa tells him, the syllables stretching out her throat, thick and glutinous. &ldquo;Ever since I was three namedays old- I&rsquo;ve been able to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had strange dreams,&rdquo; Jon mumbles, &ldquo;but never<i> this</i> strange.&rdquo;</p><p>And, abruptly, the frustration fades, replaced instead by exhaustion. &ldquo;I would be much happier if it were truly a jape,&rdquo; Sansa says flatly. &ldquo;Or a dream, or anything but the truth. But it is not. I have lived with this secret for more than a decade, Jon. And I left the Red Keep, I left Riverrun, I left <i>Winterfell-</i> more than a dozen castles I&rsquo;ve passed, each one happier than the other to house me and protect me, and I&rsquo;ve left it all behind to come here.&rdquo; <i>I&rsquo;ve left behind more than that, as well.</i> &ldquo;You can keep thinking it&rsquo;s a dream if you want, but you&rsquo;ll have to help me nevertheless.&rdquo;</p><p>He tips his head to the side. &ldquo;Help- how?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gate.&rdquo; Sansa reaches forwards, to the hands that Jon&rsquo;s unbound- if she had nails they might have dug into his skin, but she&rsquo;s bitten them to the quick instead- and looks into his eyes, dark and honest and sharp as her father&rsquo;s. <i>I don&rsquo;t trust anyone,</i> she thinks fiercely, but Jon&rsquo;s hands are warm and alive and she can&rsquo;t keep herself from gripping them too tightly. &ldquo;In Castle Black. You have to get me through it, to the other side of the Wall.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>When Jon goes to pick up the keys, Willam appears to her once more. Sansa sighs and seats herself, quietly, wishing her hair were longer- braiding it would give her something to do with her hands. She feels strained and worn instead. Like licorice pulled thin enough that it was transparent.</p><p>Her parents don&rsquo;t know where she is. Her brother didn&rsquo;t recognize her, and doesn&rsquo;t trust her even when she tells him the truth. Sansa Stark, for all that she is alive, might as well not exist. </p><p><i>Does it matter where a person is,</i> she wants to ask Willam- wants to ask Lyarra, wants to ask Minisa-<i> if there is no one else in all the world who knows where they are? </i></p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t. She leans back and shrugs under Willam&rsquo;s piercing stare.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asks Sansa, in the place of all the other things on the tip of her tongue. &ldquo;I got him to do what needed to be done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He thinks you some creature borne out of the old tales,&rdquo; Willam responds. &ldquo;Some prophet, perhaps, or a Child. Anything but his sister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-because it is so unbelievable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because-&rdquo; and here, Willam&rsquo;s tone gentles, just a little, &ldquo;-you are showing him sides of yourself you have kept shrouded in darkness all your life. It is as if a glass merchant spent all his life selling glass, and then shifted to selling diamond. Will there not be people who come to you, expecting glass wares? Will they not be surprised, startled, when that is not offered to them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Constancy is comfort,&rdquo; Sansa says, quietly.</p><p>Willam smiles at her. &ldquo;Just so. Change is difficult for people to accept. You should not have approached him as an adversary in the beginning.&rdquo; He shifts, and shines like snow in the pale sunlight. &ldquo;You will have to change that, later. It will be more difficult now.&rdquo;</p><p><i>It is the truth. Shall you turn from it?</i></p><p>Months ago, Sansa had sat in the Red Keep and looked at her grandfather, and she&rsquo;d thought, <i>yes.</i></p><p><i>No,</i> she thinks now, and she doesn&rsquo;t know what has changed, knows only that there is cold in her lungs and ice along her scalp and she has stiffened with it instead of freezing alive, knows only that she is stronger within her family&rsquo;s lands for reasons she cannot explain to anyone, reasons that still exist. <i>No, I will not turn away. I will face the worst fears. I swear it.</i></p><p>&ldquo;My grandfather,&rdquo; she says, mouth dry. She doesn&rsquo;t want to continue talking about truths that ache like this. &ldquo;When I was in the Red Keep, he told me that there was one secret that ought to be told, one secret that wasn&rsquo;t his place to tell me. He told me to tell Lyarra.&rdquo; <i>But I don&rsquo;t trust Lyarra. She&rsquo;s not telling me everything.</i> &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p><p>Willam looks a little paler at her words. &ldquo;Lyarra told me that Rickard&rsquo;s told you everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything but the first secret.&rdquo; That had been what Rickard called it, once, casually thrown into their conversations those last few weeks. &ldquo;The one that began the Stark line.&rdquo;</p><p>Again, there&rsquo;s hesitation. Slowly, Willam nods; and then he says, softly, &ldquo; It is the first secret, and always the last told. Brandon the Builder forbade his sons from ever speaking it, and Brandon the Breaker did the same, but the knowledge has lasted nevertheless.&rdquo; He frowns. &ldquo;I never understood it, truth be told- perhaps it shall make more sense to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was a daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>After a pause, Sansa realizes that it&rsquo;s it; those four words are the secret that Rickard knew, that last bit of Stark knowledge that has been whispered for years, from heir to lord to heir again. She wants to claw at her skin, just a little, with sheer frustration.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me,&rdquo; she says, quietly. &ldquo;Who had a daughter? Why was she- why is she so important? That knowledge of her remains past years and years of loss?&rdquo; </p><p>Willam smiles at her sadly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a mark of growth, to ask questions that your elders cannot answer. Perhaps you shall solve this secret, little daughter. A thing to put your name to, when this is all over.&rdquo;</p><p><i>If I do as Lyarra wishes,</i> Sansa thinks, ugliness lining her throat, terror and desire hot in her gut, <i>I will put my name on this entire world.</i></p><p><i>They will never forget </i>me,<i> not after all I have lost.</i></p><p>The air is cold and her gloves are thin and her eyes itch. Sansa feels the wind along her thin, thin hair and she imagines a sweep of red down her back, long and beautiful as a hawk&rsquo;s wings. She is exhausted, bitter, alone. She has never felt fiercer than she has in that moment, the wind billowing her from the back, sunlight shining on that skin, alive against all odds.</p><p><i>If I cannot be happy, then I will be remembered.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Jon doesn&rsquo;t trust her.</p><p>Sansa does, eventually, wash the mud from her hair, but it does little to lessen the suspicion on his face. Even with Lady obeying her commands, docile as a dog, he doesn&rsquo;t think she is- Sansa Stark- Jon seems to think she&rsquo;s something else altogether, and not a benign entity at that.</p><p>But he smuggles her through the castle quietly; and when they reach the tunnel, Jon doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to plunge into the darkness.</p><p>For a long moment, Sansa hesitates. Then she starts walking, Lady and Ghost keeping time behind her. They pause at one of the iron gates as Jon fumbles at the lock with a key. When the tunnel doesn&rsquo;t lighten at all, she coughs.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s- how many gates are there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; Jon answers brusquely. &ldquo;Two more.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Three. </i>Sansa can feel her palms growing clammy, but she doesn&rsquo;t dare loosen her grip on Dark Sister&rsquo;s hilt to wipe it. In two more gates, she has to be ready to&hellip; <i>It isn&rsquo;t kidnapping. It&rsquo;s saving a life.</i></p><p>And she has both Ghost and Lady on her side. </p><p>One more gate, then the last one. </p><p>Jon slides the key in, shoulders the slatted steel through, and Sansa emerges into the cold winter light of the world beyond the Wall. His eyes- dark and wary- are fixed on her, not on the snows around them. Sansa feels the pull of that beauty, the desire to see that and admire it, but she puts it aside to focus on her brother.</p><p><i>I will not let you die, </i>she thinks, and smiles thinly at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Jon relaxes just a little at her words, but Sansa&rsquo;s not done, not close. She steps forwards and catches his hand. &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she whispers. &ldquo;Your life isn&rsquo;t safe here, Jon. Even if they don&rsquo;t do something immediately- people are trying to kill you, and it is always easier to take a life than it is to keep one. And&hellip; and it will be better if you were with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have sworn vows,&rdquo; Jon replies, but it&rsquo;s gentler than he&rsquo;s sounded in some time. &ldquo;I have no choice.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa steps away. The leather of her boots feels like it might creak- it is so old, and her feet are curling with her impatience- but this must be done properly. She hasn&rsquo;t felt this regretful of something in a long time; even when she left Riverrun, the only pain she bartered with was her own. Now, it is Jon&rsquo;s she is toying with. His pain, his honor, his life.</p><p>If her stay in the south has taught her anything, it is that honor is worth only that value that the person places in it; and that a little pain is preferable to the loss of a life. <i>This is necessary,</i> she reminds herself. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Sansa responds, and sees how he softens further at her tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry about that, if you must know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish-&rdquo; he breaks off the words abruptly, shaking his head. &ldquo;Goodbye, then. The debt I owed you for losing to the duel is through. Good travels to you, and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never loved you as I ought,&rdquo; Sansa muses, letting one hand fall open to her side. The direwolves are far more intelligent than many people assume, which is to their detriment. But Sansa hadn&rsquo;t ever thought that even Jon would ignore Ghost&rsquo;s intellect, which is far beyond that of any common wolf&rsquo;s or other pet. When she&rsquo;d explained, the previous night, to him, Ghost had understood her. Sansa&rsquo;s sure of it. &ldquo;But that does not mean I would be glad to see you dead. And if, at the end of all of this, you&rsquo;d like to go back- I would not stop you. But only after Father has come and taken care of these men who wish to kill you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can take care of myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, well,&rdquo; says Sansa, before Ghost leaps at Jon and bears him down to the ground, before Lady gnaws through Jon&rsquo;s scabbard and divests him of half his weaponry, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t actually believe that.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>While he&rsquo;s still disoriented, Sansa tosses the keys he&rsquo;d used to unlock the gates past the first one and then cuts the weight holding the winching gears back. Jon goes rigid when he hears the thunk of the heavy steel door.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you-&rdquo; he spits, when he gets Lady&rsquo;s tail whipping straight into his face, &ldquo;-what- what&rsquo;re you <i>do-&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saving your life,&rdquo; Sansa replies, evenly. </p><p>She belts his scabbard over her own waist. It settles easily enough, but is too tight for a second loop and too loose for just one. After a shrug, she slides it over her head so it rests at a diagonal: one part of the strap at her shoulder, another at her hip. It digs into her skin, but it&rsquo;s the best compromise she currently has.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Jon hisses. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to-&rdquo; One of the direwolves barrels into him; Jon grunts and stumbles forwards. &ldquo;Our deal is <i>finished.</i> You cannot demand more of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is not a deal,&rdquo; Sansa says. &ldquo;I never thought of it as one. This is not a debt you are paying me, nor a deal we struck with swords in the woods.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Then what is this?&rdquo; he demands. </p><p>She thinks of Willam, sitting beside her, silvered and shining. She thinks of his words: <i>There are debts between people, yes, often, but the world is not all of that. There is love as well.</i> She swallows. &ldquo;Call it whatever you want. But I am your sister, and I will not let you die for the foolishness of your pride.&rdquo;</p><p>He bristles. &ldquo;My honor is-&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa reaches forwards and catches his hand, blindly, because she&rsquo;s looking into his eyes, because she knows Jon will believe this, even if he doesn&rsquo;t believe that she is real.</p><p>&ldquo;I need help,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The dead are coming, and I can defeat them, and I ca- I <i>will-</i> do it alone but- could you live with yourself?&rdquo; Jon stares at her. &ldquo;If I defeated them and you could have been beside me but weren&rsquo;t, because you were afraid?&rdquo; Sansa remembers Lyarra&rsquo;s cold, cold hands on the back of her neck, the chill that&rsquo;s offered her more comfort than almost anything else in her life. &ldquo;They say that Bran and Rickon are alive, Jon. That they&rsquo;re beyond the Wall, and alive, and safe.&rdquo; A moment to catch her breath, and then she adds the last sentence, soft and gentle and all-shaking as an avalanche. &ldquo;Honor is important, yes, but the world is more important than one man&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon tears his hands away from her and stumbles away. &ldquo;These are vows I&rsquo;ve sworn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are people relying on me.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa doesn&rsquo;t move. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father would want me to honor what I&rsquo;ve sworn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father would want you to honor your duties to your family,&rdquo; Sansa says, harsher than she&rsquo;d expected the words to sound. The lie still tastes bitter on her tongue: <i>father, father, father.</i> &ldquo;And I swear to you, your familial duties lie here, not behind that Wall.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause, not for very long at all; Jon bows his head and Sansa presses her hands together to keep from picking at her nails. Then he lifts his head and-</p><p>And he looks like an old, old hero, from one of those old tales. Not a Targaryen knight. Not a King of Winter. There&rsquo;s a tapestry hidden beside one of the crypts that Torrhen had shown her, once, parchment-thin and crumbly as old leaf, with a man&rsquo;s profile sketched in large, broad swathes. </p><p>It&rsquo;s faded. </p><p>It&rsquo;s glorious.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what Jon looks like, Sansa thinks. Old worries on a young face, beauty on bones that weren&rsquo;t built to carry them, strength dug up out of salt and snow and somehow still rooted deep. She wants to shrink away from the depths of the emotions she feels upon seeing his face; she wants to reach out and embrace it, let it burn her until she is nothing but ashes.</p><p><i>Targaryen,</i> a voice breathes into her ear, and she realizes- Visenya. He is Visenya, but younger, but tempered, but more loved than Visenya has ever known in centuries of either life or death. <i>Stark,</i> too, as Stark as Arya, who&rsquo;d been loved and adored for all she&rsquo;d never obeyed anyone&rsquo;s orders, but brighter, but uglier.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me my sword,&rdquo; says Jon, and the spell shatters as if someone had struck it with a hammer. </p><p>Sansa shudders back to life. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she says, a little numbly. &ldquo;Yes, I will- do that.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. </i>She cannot breathe for the weight of the lies, none of them hers. There are tears in her eyes, and Sansa bites them back until her throat aches. <i>You have brought something into this world that is more terrible than you could have ever thought.</i></p><p>Jon hesitates, and then he firms his shoulders. &ldquo;Which direction are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>They walk for hours.</p><p>It is strange, to be with someone whose needs must be met- Sansa has gotten used to the dead, who are tireless and limited only by the boundaries they can cross. But Jon must eat and drink and sleep, so they trade watches, and divide the food as evenly as they can. </p><p>Sansa doesn&rsquo;t realize that Jon doesn&rsquo;t believe her. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t, though- not until almost a sennight after they set out.</p><p>They&rsquo;re pitching their camp, and Sansa&rsquo;s stirring the fire with a knobbly stick while Jon returns with enough wood to keep the fire going through the night. There&rsquo;s dried berries and the remains of a snow hare for dinner; Sansa feels nausea dig into her, so she hums a little ditty to herself. </p><p>It isn&rsquo;t much. Just a little girl&rsquo;s rendition of the sea shanties that Theon Stark had taught her, which were two octaves lower than her own voice. Barely audible, even to herself.</p><p>Jon, across the camp, hearing her over the crackle of the fire, stills. He mumbles something into the wood.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; asks Sansa.</p><p>He turns to her. And Jon&rsquo;s eyes- Sansa hasn&rsquo;t ever seen them like that before, liquid-bright and hot with something that could have been either horror or ecstasy. &ldquo;Do that again,&rdquo; he whispers, &ldquo;that- song. The humming.&rdquo;</p><p>One up, three down, each note sharper than any sea shanty would ever be, but carrying its same rhythm. Sansa eyes Jon suspiciously but sings nevertheless.</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s face can&rsquo;t seem to decide what it feels. He pales further, until he looks like a half-ghost. Then he says, &ldquo;Sa-&rdquo; his voice breaks, picking up momentum a breath later, &ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; She flattens her hands on the fabric covering her knees.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I thought- I&rsquo;d forgotten that- oh, gods.&rdquo; He sits down on the ground, right there, looking sick and joyous all at once. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sansa says slowly. &ldquo;I am myself. Is something the-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t-&rdquo; Jon looks as white as a ghost. &ldquo;I thought you were some- something else. A- a story Old Nan hadn&rsquo;t remembered to tell us.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa lifts an eyebrow. &ldquo;And that was more believable to you than me being myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t-&rdquo; he gestures violently, before reaching up to scrub through his hair. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t supposed to <i>be</i> like this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dirty.&rdquo; His eyes narrow on her, and Sansa feels her amusement rise to match his annoyance. &ldquo;What changed?&rdquo;</p><p>She keeps her face as blank as she can make it, though her lips certainly twitch. &ldquo;Being trained by a woman who conquered an entire continent has the ability to change a lot of things.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You were not trained by Visenya Targaryen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was so.&rdquo; Sansa leans back, eyes wide and innocent. &ldquo;Did you know that she hates our grandfather?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon sputters. &ldquo;You did <i>not</i> speak to our grandfather.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was a tall man.&rdquo; She gnaws on the inside of her cheek to still her smile, though she can&rsquo;t quite hide it entirely. &ldquo;Grumpy, too. I see where you get it from.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; he sighs.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo;</i> she mimics, before dropping the amusement. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine. But you&rsquo;ve seen the dead- the actual <i>dead-</i> and the Night&rsquo;s King. Do you think me being able to see ghosts is so very different?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says plainly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing to think the old stories are true. It&rsquo;s another to think that my sister&rsquo;s been lying to me for her entire life. Lying to everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa folds her hands over her lap. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, because that would have gone over so well with Mother and Father,&rdquo; Sansa says flatly. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve sown all the samplers you want, Mother, I&rsquo;ve done the letters you want, Father, and, by the way, I had a <i>fascinating</i> conversation with Torrhen Stark on how his daughter planted the first blue roses in Winterfell, that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t fall asleep the way Arya did this afternoon!&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s shouting by the end. Her eyes burn, just a little, but she pushes it away in favor of gripping her wrists tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Father would have-&rdquo; Jon exhales, whistling it out through his teeth, &ldquo;-I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;d have done, because this is- this is- so strange.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you understand,&rdquo; Sansa says.</p><p>Jon moves closer to her, slowly, hesitantly- he raises his hand as if he means to draw her into an embrace, and then he drops it to cuff her shoulder instead. &ldquo;I know that they love you. Your mother might not have&hellip;&rdquo; he trails off, awkwardly, before settling against the log, back against her shins. &ldquo;Liked me, all that much. But she&rsquo;s always loved you, all of you. Arya at her brattiest. Robb at his angriest. You remember how much she yelled at Bran?&rdquo;</p><p>For weeks on end. Sansa remembers: her mother rigid with anger and worry, Bran limber and long-limbed. Every morning for two years, they&rsquo;d been woken by Catelyn yelling at Bran for climbing; so much it had become a routine, and still Bran had never thought she didn&rsquo;t love him. </p><p>Even in King&rsquo;s Landing- nobody, not a single soul, had ever doubted in Catelyn Stark&rsquo;s love for her children. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Sansa, soundless.</p><p>&ldquo;We would have understood.&rdquo; He huffs a laugh. &ldquo;Or tried. We would have tried our best, at the least.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa curls over her hands, hunching against the cold. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t trust you, </i>thinks Sansa, hands cold, heart colder. <i>I don&rsquo;t believe you.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you realize it was me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those songs. Nobody else ever liked them enough to remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you knew I was myself because I sang a sea shanty?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew you were yourself because nobody else could have sung it that badly.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>A week later, Sansa wakes to find a third wolf in their midst.</p><p>&ldquo;Summer,&rdquo; breathes Jon. </p><p>Sansa snaps her head towards him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re alive. Bran and Rickon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t believe them?&rdquo; Jon asks. &ldquo;Your ghosts-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t certain.&rdquo; She runs her fingers down Summer&rsquo;s dark fur. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be certain. There&rsquo;s been so many lies, you know- secrets, forgotten truths- I haven&rsquo;t trusted anyone. In a long time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except for me,&rdquo; says Jon.</p><p>Then he seems to understand what Sansa&rsquo;s averted face means: Jon flinches as if she&rsquo;s struck him, and he steps forwards to look at her closer. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>She tilts her head up to meet his gaze. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t anyone else&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; she says quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I <i>can,</i> anymore. Or if I ever could. I never really even considered telling anyone about how I could see ghosts, and that was before Rickard and Visenya&hellip; drove that point home.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looks horrified for a long minute, but then he scoffs- scoffs and drops to sit next to her, looking vaguely irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Trust isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s- that&rsquo;s like hair color, or your height, or anything like that. It&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;re born with. It- it certainly isn&rsquo;t your fault, Sansa, if people thought the truth was too dangerous to tell others.&rdquo; He turns, and eyes- Father&rsquo;s eyes- pierce through all of Sansa&rsquo;s shields, leave her open and bare and armorless. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t your fault that people gave you secrets to hold.&rdquo;</p><p><i>This, </i>Sansa thinks contemplatively,<i> is the happiest I&rsquo;ve felt in years.</i></p><p>She&rsquo;s hungry, cold, lonely. She&rsquo;s never even imagined that her family might try to accept her for who she is- never even allowed that hope to materialize. Sansa swallows, and rises to her feet, and when she turns to help Jon to his feet, she pulls him into a hug as well.</p><p>He&rsquo;s so warm.</p><p>(Sansa&rsquo;s tears are soft things, born of Minisa and the giving, fertile loam of the Riverlands. But now- her tears are cold, sharp; they burn down her face like ice cracking the earth open. Sansa doesn&rsquo;t regret the pain at all.</p><p>They&rsquo;re tears of joy.)</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Summer leads them.</p><p>Sansa can&rsquo;t find it in herself to breathe, but somehow she manages. Somehow, she keeps herself moving: one foot after the other, one breath in after another, hope and fear swirling in her wake like footprints embedded in snow. </p><p>Bran&rsquo;s <i>alive,</i> and Sansa&rsquo;s near him- so close- they&rsquo;ll be together again.</p><p>Them. Their family. In a snow-ridden wasteland, hurt, so close to being cleaved apart.</p><p>But together.</p><p><i>The pack survives.</i> Sansa keeps walking, Jon beside her, head up as if scenting the wind. They are not wolves, not truly; but right then, Sansa thinks she&rsquo;ll shred anyone who tries to keep her from Bran to pieces. Right then, she cannot imagine that she is fangless, clawless. <i>I have been alone for too long.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>They emerge, three direwolves and two fur-bundled humans, into the middle of a dark clearing. </p><p>There are numerous people there.</p><p>There is only one person that Sansa cares about. She rises to her toes, straining for a glimpse of-</p><p>&ldquo;Bran,&rdquo; whispers Sansa, at the shine of his red hair.</p><p>It&rsquo;s strange: Sansa is the slower of them, between her, and the direwolves, and Jon.</p><p>Perhaps there are wings that grow on her feet. Perhaps the wind aids her. Perhaps it&rsquo;s love, that gives her the speed to move so quickly. She feels something similar to it, at least: like solid flesh and blood has been replaced, for just a breath, with wind and ice.</p><p>Because she reaches Bran before Jon.</p><p>Bran, who is alive under her arms, who is warm and grown larger than the comatose figure she&rsquo;d last seen, who is <i>alive,</i> as she hasn&rsquo;t dreamt possible for months.</p><p>Then Jon is there, and he&rsquo;s holding onto Bran just as tightly, likely leaving bruises on both of their shoulders- but Sansa doesn&rsquo;t care. She couldn&rsquo;t possibly care about anything, not with her brothers beside her, safe and alive and in her arms.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>They finally settle in a cave a little distant from the clearing Summer had led them to. It&rsquo;s large and dark, but dry; and when one of the others lights a match, Sansa realizes that they aren&rsquo;t wildlings at all. </p><p>Jon starts swearing when he finally sees the same thing. </p><p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t enemies,&rdquo; says Bran quietly, when he finally deciphers what both of their sputtering means. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re- they saved my life. We were running, Meera and Jojen and I, and would&rsquo;ve been caught without Leaf&rsquo;s help. She brought us here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bran-&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa looks at them- the crowd that had allowed Bran to so much as meet them outside, for they&rsquo;d been the ones to wheel him out, certainly- and tries to pick out what, exactly, is leaving her so unnerved. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the features, which are so similar to her own and yet alien; perhaps it&rsquo;s the eyes, which are large and slitted as a cat. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the grace with which they move, too swift and curving for any human.</p><p>But Sansa&rsquo;s known ghosts for long enough to push past the initial terror, to search for the ground on which a bond can grow, so she tilts her head back at Bran.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certain?&rdquo; she asks, just as lowly.</p><p>He nods. </p><p>There&rsquo;s no hesitation there at all, and it&rsquo;s that which makes her mind up, more than anything else. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Calm down.&rdquo;</p><p>He jerks his head irritably at her. Sansa ignores him, and gets up, moving slowly towards the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sansa,&rdquo; she says, when she&rsquo;s close enough for them to know that she&rsquo;s addressing them, when it&rsquo;s unmistakable. &ldquo;Bran&rsquo;s sister. And this is Jon- he&rsquo;s our brother. We&hellip; we&rsquo;re here to help. Jon&rsquo;s spent years fighting the dead. He&rsquo;ll be invaluable to you.&rdquo;</p><p>One of the Children steps forwards slowly. &ldquo;We have not the numbers for fighting,&rdquo; they say, in a voice that rolls over Sansa&rsquo;s skin like thunder. &ldquo;And less of the will. What use have we for a commander with no forces to command?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Speak not for others,&rdquo; advises another of the Children, &ldquo;only for yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>A third one, with a voice that&rsquo;s high and sweet, says, &ldquo;I see you, sister of Bran.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone falls silent at that. Behind her, Sansa can hear Bran inhale sharply. But nobody seems willing to elaborate on the statement, not until a child steps out of the crowd. It&rsquo;s too dark to make out much of their face.</p><p>&ldquo;You shine almost as bright as the Crow,&rdquo; she says slowly, deliberately. &ldquo;Your brother has the potential to, and it shines as sparks off a stone in his chest. But you? Oh, you shed the light in your wake. His potential is realized in you, all without a weirwood to ground it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; says Sansa. She watches, numbly, as the child raises one hand to almost brush over her chest.</p><p>Then she feels someone dragging her backwards, and before she can blink, she&rsquo;s set behind Jon- who&rsquo;s standing in front of her with his shoulders thrown back, his legs spread as if to take a blow. &ldquo;Stay back,&rdquo; he growls.</p><p>Bran reaches up and grips Sansa&rsquo;s wrist, dragging her attention back to him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s blind,&rdquo; he whispers. &ldquo;She can see magic. Only magic. She&rsquo;s very old, and-&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa looks up, and sees the child tilt her head at Jon. Sees her say, &ldquo;Oh, fire and ice. Alone they are common enough, but together? There are things that ought not to be in this world. You are one of them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; says Bran, and it&rsquo;s authoritative enough that they all fall silent. Even Jon stops bristling enough to be surprised that he&rsquo;s listening to Bran; Sansa&rsquo;s surprised enough, because she remembers how quiet he&rsquo;d been. Those months of watching Robb lead must have affected him in some manner though, and if this is it, she&rsquo;ll take it and be glad. &ldquo;Perhaps we can-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Crow will wish to see her,&rdquo; says the child. &ldquo;And him, I suppose, if for nothing more than the fire.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran nods as if her words make sense. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, then,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>They arrive at a weirwood tree. The hall is well-lit, which is why Sansa can see the man sitting atop a seat made of the weirwood roots- he&rsquo;s pale and gaunt, save for a patchy rash running from the side of his neck up to his cheekbone. Fine, thin strands of silvery hair are in disarray around him.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Sansa asks carefully.</p><p>He tilts his head to her, but doesn&rsquo;t speak for a long minute. Sansa wonders if he&rsquo;s even going to answer- but then he does.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the three-eyed Crow,&rdquo; he says, voice hoarse and rasping. It makes Sansa want to shiver out of her skin, the unearthly scrape of it. &ldquo;But I was not always this. Perhaps you have heard of a lord named Brynden?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brynden Waters,&rdquo; breathes Sansa. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the man- Brynden, Brynden Waters, the person she&rsquo;s been charged with meeting by her grandmother and Visenya, two people who&rsquo;d likely never agree on anything else from this to the end of time. &ldquo;You know of me, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Hands shaking, Sansa undoes her scabbard and removes Dark Sister. </p><p>&ldquo;You would know this blade,&rdquo; she says. </p><p>He laughs. &ldquo;I would know that blade even if I&rsquo;d not seen it in half a thousand dreams. How came a Stark by Dark Sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By Visenya&rsquo;s own tutelage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She does not tutor often,&rdquo; says Brynden, voice turning even slower, ponderous. &ldquo;Those she takes an interest in are great, always, no matter whether they are terrible or wonderful. It is a gift that she has, my many-times grandmother. To find the best and know them, even when they do not know it themselves. Tell me, daughter of House Stark: what would drive a girl with Visenya&rsquo;s stamp to come this far north?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The dead,&rdquo; says Sansa, swallowing. &ldquo;As it drove you, once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I came to the Wall because I did not wish to die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you crossed it because there was something happening, and you wished to know what it was.&rdquo; Sansa juts her chin upwards. &ldquo;I know that the dead are there. My brother- Jon- has fought against armies of them. Legions. Ghosts that have never feared for anything in their entire existence are shivering, timorous beings. And I know that I can help against them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; asks Brynden, slowly shifting forwards, like a tree bending in a strong gale. &ldquo;Tell me what you will do.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa stares into his lone, red eye. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she says. Jon makes an aborted sound behind her; she ignores him. &ldquo;But you do.&rdquo;</p><p>Again, there&rsquo;s silence. This time, it doesn&rsquo;t stay silent, not for Sansa. Her heartbeat echoes and echoes against her ears, thundering like a drum. She&rsquo;s gambled so much on three words. If she&rsquo;s wrong- if her grandmother, if her grandfather- are wrong- </p><p>Death will be the least of her worries.</p><p>But then, Brynden Waters nods. Short, shaky; but a nod nevertheless.</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But it is a long tale. And to appreciate it properly, you shall need- need to know more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More of what?&rdquo; asks Sansa sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the final secret of your house, Sansa Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How would you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; says Bran, who&rsquo;s seated beside her. His eyes are glowing, in the dim light. It looks so strange. &ldquo;He knows it already, Sansa.&rdquo;</p><p>Reluctantly, Sansa says, &ldquo;There was a daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Brynden, softly. &ldquo;There was.&rdquo; Then, a little more briskly: &ldquo;Take rest for now. Sleep, eat; the Children shall help you. And tonight, they shall tell you a story. It will answer some of your questions, I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t speak again. </p><p>&hellip;</p><p>That night, Sansa&rsquo;s seated besides Jon in an enormous cavern. She&rsquo;s eaten some sort of a stew; it&rsquo;s not very filling, but is very warm, so she&rsquo;s rather grateful for it anyhow. Then the quiet movements around her still- people seat themselves, settle in as always for stories, the same way people would do in Winterfell&rsquo;s Great Hall.</p><p>The Children whisper amongst each other, a gentle susurration of sound. Sansa waits.</p><p>Finally, a woman steps forward- or, Sansa thinks it&rsquo;s a woman; she has more delicate features than some of the others, and a slightly higher voice- and she speaks, words accented strangely.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember a time millennia past,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;that you cannot possibly imagine. Things of wonder and horror and magic.&rdquo; She pauses, and her green eyes glow brighter. &ldquo;You have said that you know of the Pact. For years after signing it, we had peace. Many of our number did not think it possible- that your people could ever honor something when they loved its opposite so dearly, for not a single year went by without war of some sort. But you managed to hold the treaty for centuries. And then you came for our forests.&rdquo;</p><p>Another child says something, cutting her off. They sound irritable, or perhaps reprimanding; the one who&rsquo;d spoken responds sharply and they fall into an argument that slithers around Sansa&rsquo;s ears as so many snakes.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you certain-&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; </i>Sansa replies, hissing, into Jon&rsquo;s ear. Yes, she is certain this is necessary. Not a good idea, perhaps. Not a safe idea, perhaps. But these people haven&rsquo;t hurt Bran in the weeks that he&rsquo;s been with them, and she also knows full well how it feels to have a person- a real, live person, with even the slightest bit of power- ask for an explanation without ulterior motives. They want to tell her this story. It might not be easy, but- she can feel its importance already, in the way the words trip up her spine like so many warmed stones.</p><p>Finally, the child who&rsquo;d spoken returns her attention to them. &ldquo;My- companion-&rdquo; she says, in a voice that lets Sansa know how this admission galls her, &ldquo;-wishes you to know that your people&rsquo;s greed was not all of it. There were offerings given, and treaties struck, and we responded to a few cases of greed with overmuch zeal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Offerings?&rdquo; Jon inquires. </p><p>He could sound more polite, but he could also sound far less. Sansa decides to cut her losses instead of snapping at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Of wool, and silks, and meat that dwells in flatlands that we hadn&rsquo;t access to for years.&rdquo; The child shrugs. &ldquo;You wished for wood, and we offered that in return for all of those things. But some men took more than they gave. When we went to your kings&hellip; they did not hear us. They did not listen.&rdquo; She lowers her voice, until it sounds like the wind&rsquo;s rasp through a tree&rsquo;s leaves. &ldquo;One of the proudest, one of the greatest, was Brandon Builder. We do not have kings, did not have them even when our numbers rivalled your own- but we saw through the trees and realized you would not listen if we sent one of us alone to you. So we sang a child out of the mud, each one of us giving him a gift of our own. And we sent him to your king, this child of the Children.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what he said?&rdquo; another child asks. This one has a rounder face, sharper cheekbones; he looks younger than the first one. &ldquo;Brandon Builder, your thousand-times forefather- he refused to hear us. And when our child returned, he called us together for war.&rdquo;</p><p>The first one continues: &ldquo;The child was not the proper answer to our problems. We had wished to ready him for kings, and in doing so we made him too proud. Too vengeful. He led us into a war we were not ready for, for reasons none of us knew save for injured pride and revenge.&rdquo; She snorts. &ldquo;The first act of the war was our last.&rdquo;</p><p><i>One act, </i>Sansa thinks, fingers drumming against her thigh.<i> One act, so terrible it destroyed an entire race.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Brandon Builder had one daughter,&rdquo; says the second child. </p><p>Jon shakes his head almost immediately. &ldquo;He had only sons,&rdquo; he challenges. &ldquo;Three sons, and no daughters. If there&rsquo;s one thing everyone agrees upon-&rdquo;</p><p><i>The first truth,</i> Sansa thinks, a chill gripping her bones. <i>The oldest Stark truth: there was a daughter.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she says, reaching out to grip his elbow, eyes affixed to the children. &ldquo;Just- listen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He had five sons,&rdquo; whispers the first child. &ldquo;I know it well, Stark-son. I was there for it all. He had five sons: one heir and another with arrows sharp as dragonglass and another with a tongue even sharper and another with eyes bright as a sunrise and another with a gift for crafting that even his father did not have; and one daughter: her name was-&rdquo; she says something, a long, liquid stream of syllables that makes Sansa shiver; it slips out of her mind almost immediately, however, and for all that she tries, she cannot remember it. </p><p>She smiles thinly. &ldquo;You will not remember her name. Only those who knew her before she- she became what she is now, can know it. We sacrificed that in the name of our vengeance.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon turns his head towards Sansa, creakingly slowly. There&rsquo;s an old terror in his eyes, and she finds herself reaching forwards, slotting her fingers through his. </p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Sansa asks, quietly. <i>How do you unmake a name? How is that</i> possible?</p><p>&ldquo;The child that we made- he was made, you see. Until him- Children appeared. We are of the trees and the streams, and when the magic is enough we are formed, whole. That is how I came, from a poplar tree; that is how-&rdquo; another string of syllables that Sansa could not pronounce, though this one stays in her mind, &ldquo;-came, from a stone rounded at the bend of a river. It is how we all come. Until we made <i>him,</i> and though he looked and spoke and sang as if one of us, he did not have what we have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Contentment.&rdquo; She reaches forwards and the trees before her burst into flowers- greenish rim, with a scarlet middle. Poplar flowers. &ldquo;When the land has enough, it is contented. It is not <i>greedy.</i> But he did not have that in him, though he had enough to know what he did not have.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon lifts one eyebrow. &ldquo;Humans can be greedy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not this kind of greedy. The kind where you have nothing inside of you, where there is a coldness within in the place of a soul. He wanted. And so he took, and named it vengeance so we would follow him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He formed the Others, then,&rdquo; Sansa says, with certainty. Horror is there, yes, but the world seems to thrum above that, a drum-beat in echo with her heart. This is important, and a history that ought to be known. &ldquo;He cut souls out of other- people, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>The first child closes her hand into a fist, and the poplar flowers shrivel. &ldquo;We stole Brandon Builder&rsquo;s daughter. And we watched as he did it- as he transferred her soul into his body. But souls are not meant to be cut out like that, nor to be touched by mortal hands. It was not a good job- he left pieces behind in her, of her soul, could not do enough. He was vaporized- the world caved in around us. We all nearly died. And the Night&rsquo;s Queen was formed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brandon Builder raged.&rdquo; The other child&rsquo;s voice rustles, like water, like waves. She sounds empty. &ldquo;She was beautiful and terrible and there was nothing that we could do against her. So we went to him, and Brandon Builder killed our envoys, led an army of a hundred thousand into our forests and cut us down where we slept.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Night&rsquo;s Queen killed us for the emptiness of her soul, and Brandon Builder killed us for our cruelty. At first she fed on Children alone; but when humans came too close, she had few compunctions about killing them as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She killed two of her brothers,&rdquo; says the second child. &ldquo;The heir, and the crafter. They who had tried to bring back their sister died before even uttering a word, and finally, still mourning, Brandon Builder called his people together and built a monument that still lasts to this day.&rdquo;</p><p><i>What in the world-</i></p><p>&ldquo;The Wall,&rdquo; whispers Jon.</p><p>The Children hiss angrily at the word. It takes Sansa a moment to understand, because- well, they&rsquo;ve not understood anything Sansa and Jon have said in the entire conversation; or at least they&rsquo;ve pretended not to- but this word, this single word- it&rsquo;s not in the Old Tongue, but the children know it.</p><p><i>Wall, </i>thinks Sansa. The word they use now recalls the structure that Brandon built. It is, perhaps, the oldest word in their language.</p><p>The first child inclines her head slowly. &ldquo;Eight thousand years later, and we still cannot approach it. The magic woven into it- it&rsquo;s something that repels us. We cannot cross it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Jon says flatly, &ldquo;you died out.&rdquo;</p><p>The second folds her hands together. &ldquo;Even so. The last great thing we did was to erase her from history. Her name is gone. No longer can it remain in memory or writing, save for those who were alive and knew it before the spell was cast. And year by year, that number lessens. Until all those left are those before you now, whittled down to tens that once numbered millions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; whispers Sansa.</p><p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says the first child, &ldquo;you asked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A name gives power,&rdquo; says the second child. &ldquo;Quiet power. Still power. But power nonetheless. Why do you think you name your sons Brandon? Because there is a power to it, one that you know but cannot understand. The Night&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s father knew this, and didn&rsquo;t wish for it to happen. He had lost almost everything to us. Two sons, his sole daughter; the peace he&rsquo;d fought for all his life. And he came to us and asked us for one boon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A hollow boon, perhaps, but a boon nevertheless.&rdquo; The first child smiles, ghastly. &ldquo;We gave it to him. You know what we called it, when we did? <i>The highest kindness.</i> The best apology we could make.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was it enough?&rdquo; asks Jon.</p><p>Sansa knows the answer before ever the Children speak. How can it ever be enough? Life for a life is unequal, always. One life can never be matched by another. Hundreds? Thousands? It is like asking which is more devastating: the tides, or the floods. Each, in its own way. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says the first child. &ldquo;But we tried.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a scraping sound from the weirwood throne- Sansa jerks her head up and looks at Brynden Waters, whom she&rsquo;d forgotten existed, while listening to the story.</p><p>&ldquo;You asked what you can do, Sansa Stark,&rdquo; he says, scrapingly slowly. &ldquo;And this is your answer: you are the latest descendant of this house, which has scarred this land immeasurably. It is your burden. To stand; to fight. What can you do? You are a protector. Stripped bare, carved hollow, bleeding and weeping to death- you are a protector.&rdquo; He smiles, and it carves into his face like a weirwood&rsquo;s tears. &ldquo;What can you do? You can protect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s-&rdquo; Jon begins.</p><p>But Brynden speaks over him, like he isn&rsquo;t even there. </p><p>&ldquo;Your brother will keep greenseeing alive. Those are older traditions than those of House Stark. But for this war? You will need to fight its most vital battle. You will need to be unfaltering. Stronger than any other. Stronger than even you can imagine.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s shaking his head. Bran looks pale, strained. The other Children are shifting uneasily.</p><p>Sansa lifts her head, meets Brynden Waters&rsquo; lone, red eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do I fight it?&rdquo; she asks.</p>",

It&rsquo;s weird, but so&rsquo;s my brain!</b></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://dialux.tumblr.com/tagged/a-tempest%3B-a-cyclone\" target=\"_blank\">Previous chapters can be found here.</a></b></p>\n<p><b>Chapter Four: she wears fire for skin but a storm lives in her soul</b><br /></p>\n<p>Snow is seeping into Sansa&rsquo;s clothes. </p>\n<p>She refuses to move, however, and even less to give away her position. There can be no mistakes made now: Sansa <i>must</i> succeed, for the price of failure is too great to contemplate, much less allow.</p>\n<p>Lady- Sansa can sense her, vaguely, off behind the small bush she&rsquo;s hidden behind. She&rsquo;d yipped some time previous, but the silence now makes her feel wary. Their prey approaches, and Sansa must be fast enough to strike, quick enough to do so without letting him attack her in return.</p>\n<p>And then she hears, distantly, the snap of a twig.</p>\n<p>Dark Sister is perfectly balanced in one hand. Sansa shifts her weight from one leg to another, then back, ensuring she&rsquo;s ready to jump out. She breathes in, slowly, and Ghost bounds into the clearing.</p>\n<p>Not a few minutes later, so does Jon.</p>\n<p>Her breath catches.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s older than she remembers; his hair is raggeder, and there&rsquo;s a stiffness to his shoulders that Sansa hasn&rsquo;t seen before. If anything, Jon&rsquo;s grown to look even more like their father.</p>\n<p><i>My father. </i>The truth tastes like ashes in her mouth. <i>Jon&rsquo;s uncle.</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;What was so important, boy?&rdquo; Jon demands of Ghost, pressing his hands to his knees and panting. &ldquo;That you had to-&rdquo; he straightens, abruptly, and half-draws his sword out of the scabbard, turning to the shadows exactly opposite to Sansa, from which a soft noise has come. &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s there&hellip;&rdquo; His voice sounds menacing. </p>\n<p>Lady pads out of the darkness, and Sansa makes full use of Jon&rsquo;s momentary distraction to start moving forwards.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Lady?&rdquo; asks Jon, almost reaching out to touch her. &ldquo;You survived? I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo; he swallows, hard. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d died.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She should keep silent, according to the very plan that she&rsquo;d hashed out last night- hit Jon over the head, and let him wake up after that, bound so he&rsquo;s forced to listen to her words. But seeing the way Jon&rsquo;s hands tremble, as if a strong wind had blown between the spaces of his fingers- Sansa cannot. The weight of a hundred worlds could have borne down on her &nbsp;tongue, and it would not have mattered.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says Sansa, softly. He goes stiff about the shoulders. &ldquo;And neither did I.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon whirls around, and Sansa has all of a heartbeat to realize that he&rsquo;s not been calmed by seeing Lady; he&rsquo;s palmed a knife instead, one that he uses to slash at Sansa&rsquo;s arm. She stumbles back, sleeve ripping, and Jon uses the moment to draw his sword.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you?&rdquo; he asks, eyes narrowing on her.</p>\n<p>Sansa smiles tremulously. &ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t remember?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you want to talk, you&rsquo;ll drop that sword.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t soften, not even a little, and Sansa feels her heart stumble a little. Her mother, her father- they wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized her, would they? She&rsquo;s changed so much that-</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she says, struggling to keep her voice even, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you think-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Her words are cut off when Jon releases a flurry of blows at her, half of which she catches as a matter of habit and the other half of which she deflects by sheer chance. His hands tighten further on his sword&rsquo;s hilt and Sansa takes two large steps backwards, her lungs aching.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Sansa,&rdquo;</i> she snaps breathlessly. &ldquo;You absolute moron, it&rsquo;s <i>me,</i> stop fighting-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon laughs. Then he says, &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s in King&rsquo;s Landing. If you want to lie to me, try to do better than that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><i>I don&rsquo;t want to do this. Listen to me, you utter buffoon!</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying,&rdquo; says Sansa, fright and irritation melding together into a strange amalgam in her chest to produce an even stranger voice. &ldquo;Listen, I need you to <i>listen-&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; replies Jon, and spins neatly to catch her across her underarm. </p>\n</p>",

I was holding up dress to cover my still developing breasts. My feet bled from the stones and branches cutting at my soft flesh. </p><p>Running was definitely harder when you&rsquo;re overweight, I was wondering how I hadn&rsquo;t tripped when I kept looking back over my left shoulder to see if my torturers were still after me. I saw the fire of his torch and the closing of his horse, knowing I had no chance. </p><p>I was tired and hungry. My feet and head ache. My arm had a nasty gnash that was probably infected. No matter how terrible he was to me, he gave me at least some food and a bed. I sank to my knees in pain as I let him catch up to me.</p><p>He grabbed hold of my silver hair and slapped both of my cheeks. I felt a tiny stream of blood trickle down my face. </p><p>&ldquo;Beastly whore! Think you can run from the king? Your uncle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are no uncle or king to me. You are my rapist, my abuser, my enemy, and my torturer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up or I&rsquo;ll let the guards get their share of your cunt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you would&rsquo;ve done any different.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. You need to hurt worse. You are a disgusting beast anyway. I&rsquo;ll find something for you to do.&rdquo;</p><p>I laid on the cold stone floor on my room&ndash;or should I say, prison? After I returned to the castle, the guards and common men alike had their fair share of me. Then I was stripped and publicly flogged and then they had some more fun with me. Women started to jeer at me and insult me. They threw their rotten goods at my beaten, naked body. </p><p>I was thrown in my cell after and here I lay now. I need to leave this hell. I&rsquo;m not to be their toy any longer.</p><p>I felt my burning rage begin to rise in my stomach and my eyes shone red. I felt my hands and feet turn into paws and hind legs. I buried my feelings and returned to normal. </p><p>Before I turned into the beast, I need to escape this cell. I couldn&rsquo;t do that as I was injured. As if the Gods heard my pleas, a nurse came in to treat my obvious wounds.</p><p>I hissed as the old woman cleaned my wounds with that searing liquid. She looked at me sympathetically. I gave her a weak smile in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Your uncle is cruel man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He hated me for not being a nephew already. I don&rsquo;t know why my mother is related to such a cruel man. The fact that she also gave me this curse was too much for him. He thinks I deserve this. I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Child, shut the hell up. I may be a maid and I may be old. But I see you for the beautiful and powerful girl you are. Not a cursed beastly whore those out there think you are. I&rsquo;m giving you these gifts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were a maid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am. I never said they were from me. I&rsquo;m just delivering them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are they from?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Viserys, Rhaegar, and Danearys Targeryan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My brothers and sister? They are being hunted by King Robert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are fleeing yes, but they decided that you needed a few things for your escape.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rhaegar is gone. Viserys probably only cares that I join him when he plans to take over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that boy is selfish and stupid but he does love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand. What are they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait for me to finish with your wounds. Then we must hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>She hastily bandaged my torso and my arm. She also gave me a simple black halter dress and brushed out my waist length hair.</p><p>After helping me, she pulled out a case that I somehow didn&rsquo;t notice. She opened slow to to reveal a twin set of beautiful daggers. Each had two blades that easily kill a man with one good stab.</p><p>&ldquo;Even ladies need a little protection.&rdquo; Maid smiled as she pulled out another thing. A box that was about the size of my outstretched palm. I took it gently and opened it. Another something beautiful. A necklace. It was a silver compass with an engraving on the back. no matter where you are.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s from Danaerys.&rdquo; I nodded quickly as I put it on. </p><p>&ldquo;And a very long letter explaining many things. Do not open it until you have a place where you&rsquo;re sure you are safe. You never know who could be listening. Now, my child, get out of my sight. Get out of the castle. Change into your other form and function! Now! Farewell.&rdquo;</p><p>I hugged her tight and quick before looking into her green eyes. &ldquo;I will norm forget this.&rdquo;</p><p>I ran out of the open cell with my hair flying and my daggers in hand. I didn&rsquo;t cross guards thank gods but I did lock eyes with my uncle. He snarled as he watched me steal a guards belt and sheath my weapons. I bared my teeth at him as I changed.</p><p>I dropped onto my hands and knees. My hands became paws and I felt my bum grow a tail. My nose stretched into a snout and my hair melted into silver fur. I became an alpha direwolf. I looked at the frightened faces of those surrounding my uncle and growled at the before finally escaping my hell.</p><p>I had run about twenty miles from the castle before stopping and changing back into a ten year old girl. Yes, I was only ten years old when this is happened, but I got through it. No riders or guards followed me out. So, I was safe for now but couldn&rsquo;t afford to stop moving. </p><p>I trekked through the dark forest and heard nothing except rustling leaves the branches crunching beneath my feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; A deep voice called out. I spun around in fear to myself surrounded by disgusting men.</p><p>&ldquo;A fat little girl all alone in the woods. Probably a virgin, boys.&rdquo; The same man spoke. I almost laughed. The man didn&rsquo;t get to speak again though. A few different looking men came in on horses. </p><p>One of the bandits did take me into his arms.
