Hope you guys like it too! xx</b></i></p><p>It had been a few days that she had\u00a0seen him there. Always standing at\u00a0the same spot,\u00a0hand always clutched on the handle above and his eyes fixed on the road outside. Maybe at times, there would be a book in his hand and his face,\u00a0buried deep in it.</p><p><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His face, though.</i></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Y/N didn&rsquo;t think, she ever got a proper glimpse of it. Nonetheless,\u00a0she could tell he was pretty. Curly brown hair swept across his forehead, jaw sharp and his eyes- he had a beautiful pair of eyes. Green as forest, yet dull and grey as London sky.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What made him so sad?</i></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She often\u00a0wondered.</p><p><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What had sent him into this oblivion?

Too desolated to talk, too desolated to speak?</i></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He wasn&rsquo;t more than 18, she could tell but that didn&rsquo;t solve any of the puzzles she had inside her head.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was young. He shouldn&rsquo;t be\u00a0as hurt as he looked, he shouldn&rsquo;t be taking this tedious train\u00a0every day and living his life in the monotony he seemed to live in.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Y/N wanted to help. She wanted to make this all right for him. Yet, he was none but a mere stranger<i>. A beautiful one though</i>, yet a sad one.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She felt naive to think about it. And naiver for not having the courage to go talk to a teenage boy. But, she couldn&rsquo;t blame herself either. It seemed as if he wanted nothing to do with anyone or\u00a0anything or <i>perhaps</i> <i>life itself.</i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Everyone seemed to feel the same way too.

                "content": "<p><h1>Pretty and Invisible </h1><p><i>- &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be able to see me&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>A/N: okay I&rsquo;m proud of this one. Hope you guys like it too! xx</b></i></p><p>It had been a few days that she had&nbsp;seen him there. Always standing at&nbsp;the same spot,&nbsp;hand always clutched on the handle above and his eyes fixed on the road outside. Maybe at times, there would be a book in his hand and his face,&nbsp;buried deep in it.</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face, though.</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y/N didn&rsquo;t think, she ever got a proper glimpse of it. Nonetheless,&nbsp;she could tell he was pretty. Curly brown hair swept across his forehead, jaw sharp and his eyes- he had a beautiful pair of eyes. Green as forest, yet dull and grey as London sky.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made him so sad?</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She often&nbsp;wondered.</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What had sent him into this oblivion? Where he didn&rsquo;t seem&nbsp;care or notice&nbsp;anything around him? Too desolated to talk, too desolated to speak?</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t more than 18, she could tell but that didn&rsquo;t solve any of the puzzles she had inside her head.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was young. He shouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp;as hurt as he looked, he shouldn&rsquo;t be taking this tedious train&nbsp;every day and living his life in the monotony he seemed to live in.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y/N wanted to help. She wanted to make this all right for him. Yet, he was none but a mere stranger<i>. A beautiful one though</i>, yet a sad one.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She felt naive to think about it. And naiver for not having the courage to go talk to a teenage boy. But, she couldn&rsquo;t blame herself either. It seemed as if he wanted nothing to do with anyone or&nbsp;anything or <i>perhaps</i> <i>life itself.</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Everyone seemed to feel the same way too. There wasn&rsquo;t a day when she saw someone speak to him or even look at his direction, for that matter. It was as if, he was invisible and Y/N was the&nbsp;only person who could see him. <i>But how was that possible?</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Invisible</i>.&nbsp;With its literal meaning, it wasn&rsquo;t possible. And with its rhetorical meaning, it wasn&rsquo;t possible either. He seemed to be the person who would catch anyone&rsquo;s attention, he had the looks. And he&nbsp;clearly caught hers.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first day she saw him, she had woken up a little late. She had done her morning routine in a hurry yet she couldn&rsquo;t catch her usual train. So, she had waited a minute or so and got into the first train that came next. And, just after getting in, her eyes had fallen on him, and <i>he</i> had looked at her too.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>He had an intense gaze</i>, Y/N remembered.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, she had looked away. She had always been shy and there was no way she could hold eye contact with a stranger -&nbsp;<i>especially when the stranger was as pretty as him.</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After that day, she missed her&nbsp;usual train every day and&nbsp;that train became her usual train. Y/N seemed to reach her college on time and she got to&nbsp;see him too. But he never looked at her - again. After she had broken the eye contact she did give a glance at his direction, and to her dismay, he wasn&rsquo;t looking. <i>And he never did.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If she knew he&nbsp;would never look at her after that,&nbsp;she might&rsquo;ve never looked away.</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Y/N felt silly really. She felt like a teenager all over again - scared of talking to boys and just staring at them from afar. But the good thing was he never seemed to notice her gaze, like the boys in her high school.</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was too oblivious.</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After over a month, today she finally decided to talk to him. <i>She was an adult</i>,&nbsp;she told herself <i>and she was going to handle this like an adult.</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So instead of seating at the front of the train compartment, she had sat at the end, where he stood across with his gaze fixed on the window.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was another thing, she noticed. <i>He never sat.</i> The train would be half empty&nbsp;but he&rsquo;d never seat, he&rsquo;d just stand at the corner of the compartment where not much people would like to stand.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After looking at him for a while that day, she got up slowly. The train wasn&rsquo;t much crowded, so she easily made her way towards him. He didn&rsquo;t notice her, even when she stood just behind him.</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was too oblivious.</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey,&ldquo; she finally got the courage. Few people looked at her, but only&nbsp;he didn&rsquo;t. He was still too mesmerized by the city he saw through the window.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Excuse me,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking to you,&rdquo; she put a hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N didn&rsquo;t know what was it. It almost felt as if, <i>he</i> almost felt as if he was a mist, a vapor under her hand, diluting under her&nbsp;touch. However,&nbsp;Y/N couldn&rsquo;t ponder much at that, <i>he turned.</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said again, this time with a smile. &ldquo;I saw you a few times, just wanted to introduce myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stranger had his brows furrowed then, as he peered down at her, but he said nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N was almost regretting coming up to him, but it was too late to turn back.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"So, I&rsquo;m Y/N,&ldquo; she let out a nervous laugh. She was about to take her hand out for him, but she decided against it.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It would be much more embarrassing if he just kept her hanging there.</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stranger didn&rsquo;t reply, he just looked at her, with his eyebrows still furrowed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N was about to quickly say sorry and walk away but then he spoke, however, it was as if he was speaking more to himself. And what he said, Y/N couldn&rsquo;t quite comprehend.</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You shouldn&rsquo;t be able to see me.&rdquo;</i></p></p>",
