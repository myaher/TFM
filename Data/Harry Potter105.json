I do mostly Harry Potter, DC/Marvel, or tabletop RPG characters, but I&rsquo;m open to pretty much anything within reason. Just give me good descriptions, references, or free reign.

The Dursley\u2019s were allergic to Amy\u2019s happiness, after all. </p><p>There was a lot of sand, a lot of people and the water stretched as far as the eye could see. It was beautiful and she wanted to see everything. Other children played in the sand, making sand castles and Amy loved having playmates that didn\u2019t know she was a freak. \u00a0</p><p>Except, Amy forgot. She forgot that Dudley was still there. </p><p>Half-way to the first day of the vacation, Dudley took up Amy-Hunting again. This time, she wasn\u2019t in her home turf and she didn\u2019t know the best hiding spots. This time, there was no library that was practically Dudley-repellent. </p><p>But. </p><p>There was the sea. </p><p>There was the sea, full of water. And Dudley didn\u2019t know how to swim. </p><p>So. Faced with Dudley\u2019s fists and the sea, Amy took the sea\u2026then she forgot that she couldn\u2019t swim too. </p><p>When she was seven, Amaranth Lilian Potter drowned. </p><p>. </p><hr><p>. </p><p>She didn\u2019t expect to wake up. </p><p>She was in the water, deep and tossed to and fro by the current. </p><p>She was breathing. </p><p>Her mouth opened in shock and she gurgled in further shock when she realized that the saltwater didn\u2019t burn her throat and that she could, in fact, speak. </p><p>Human throats weren\u2019t meant to vocalize underwater, and if Amy were any older, she could have recognized the change. </p><p>But Amy was very young, and the only thing she did was try to find her way back to the shore, where the Dursley\u2019s didn\u2019t even notice their young charge missing. </p><p>. </p><hr><p>. </p><p>Then, she surfaced. \u00a0</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t speak. </p><p>. </p><hr><p>. </p><p>Amy doesn\u2019t remember much after she and everyone else realized this, except that there was a lot of doctors. </p><p>Aunt Petunia seemed terrified about it and couldn\u2019t stop demanding things, screaming at the doctors and asking what was wrong. </p><p>Amy couldn\u2019t tell her. \u00a0</p><p>Every breath that passed her throat burned and any attempt at speech resulted in a high-pitch, glass breaking screeching sound. </p><p>Breathing air didn\u2019t hurt, exactly. It\u2019s just that air felt too much. It felt like gulping in too much oxygen, like she was drowning in dry land. </p><p>The air brushed against her eye lashes, brushing her face, and she was reminded somehow of the waves brushing her face under the water. </p><p>Finally, when the tests all said inconclusive, a nurse took her aside and gave her a pamphlet. It was a school for British Sign Language, a cheap one near Surrey. </p><p>Thank you, Amy tried to say with her smile. </p><p>The nurse understood and patted her on the back. </p><p>Behind her, Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t scream anymore. She started crying, the sound startling. \u00a0</p><p>In all her life, she had never seen her aunt cry and she understood, for the first time since entering the hospital, the gravity of her situation. </p><p>. </p><hr><p>. </p><p>Aunt Petunia was harder on her, after that. \u00a0</p><p>There was a lot of teachers, and Amy could sign things.
