Fresh snow blanketed the sleepy village in a sea of sparkling white. A few straggling couples wandered through the street, waiting for tables to open up at the most popular establishments. Gendry spotted his friend Jon exiting Honeyduke&rsquo;s with Sansa. Still no sign of Arya. Gendry sighed, turning his attention back to the laminated menu in front of him.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing this, by the way. I know it must be hard.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his menu, he peered across the table at Elinor.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that enough,\u201d Elinor continued, placing her menu down. \u201cMy break-up with Alyn almost destroyed me, but even if this doesn\u2019t end the way I want it to, I\u2019m glad to have met you, and Arya and Hot Pie too.\u201d She squeezed his hand.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; Gendry responded before glancing around the tea shop. Students occupied every nook and cranny of the cramped shop floor. &ldquo;It sure is crowded today.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always packed this time of year.\u201d Elinor examined her pink nails.</p><p>A slender waitress sidled up to their table which was tucked in the front corner of the tea shop next to the window. \u201cWelcome to Madam Puddifoot\u2019s. My name\u2019s Ros, and I\u2019ll be your server today. Can I get you guys something to start off?\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the rose tea and some strawberry shortcake, thank you,&rdquo; Elinor flashed her a dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd for you?\u201d Ros turned to Gendry.</p><p>&ldquo;Earl Grey and almond cake, please,&rdquo; Gendry answered. Ros scribbled their orders down in a notepad before relieving them of their menus. As she disappeared into the kitchen, Gendry scanned the crowded restaurant again. His gaze landed on a suspicious couple seated near the back of the restaurant that he suspected were Robb and Dany, though it was hard to tell given their ill-fitting wigs and oversized sunglasses. A flash of silvery blonde hair peeked out from behind the girl&rsquo;s wig. A thick red mustache, obviously magicked into existence, covered the boy\u2019s upper lip. Gendry narrowed his eyes at the odd couple. They both waved at him and gave him two thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cWhy are Robb and Dany sitting in the back corner in disguise?\u201d Gendry whispered across the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Dany said something about \u2018moral support&rsquo; and making sure everything went according to plan when I talked to her this morning,&rdquo; Elinor replied. &ldquo;But yes, it is a little strange that they\u2019re in such bad disguises.\u201d She examined the odd couple even closer. \u201cThose sunglasses are a little overkill.\u201d</p><p>Ros appeared at the table with a tray balanced on her hand, blocking their view of Robb and Dany. &quot;There you are.\u201d She placed a delicate pink teacup and saucer in front of Elinor, before putting a matching set in front of Gendry. &quot;Rose and Earl Grey teas.&rdquo; She completed the set by placing a pitcher of milk in the center of the table between them and then handed them each a slice of cake. \u201cLet me know if you need anything else.\u201d With that, Ros moved onto the next table.</p><p>Elinor dropped a spoon of sugar into her steaming cup as Gendry stabbed his almond cake with his fork. The moist cake melted in his mouth, the almond colliding with a hint of vanilla.</p><p>\u201cThis cake is delicious,\u201d Gendry moaned.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Elinor sighed. &ldquo;If this place weren&rsquo;t such a couples spot I&rsquo;d probably be in here every Hogsmeade trip for the strawberry shortcake alone.&rdquo;</p><p>In his periphery, Robb gestured frantically at the door. Gendry raised a quizzical brow as he took a sip of his tea.</p><p>\u201cThe signal!\u201d Elinor exclaimed. She whipped her head toward the front door. \u201cAlyn must be coming in. Quick, grab my hand.\u201d Gendry almost choked on his tea when she snatched his free hand, holding it tightly. \u201cHe\u2019s got one of those dreadful Frey girls on his arm, ugh.\u201d Frowning, she glared daggers at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s unsuspecting date.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Gendry asked, placing his teacup back on its saucer.</p><p>Elinor shook her head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her gaze followed Alyn and his date as they trailed after the hostess through the restaurant to one of the tables in the back near Robb and Dany. Alyn held a chair out for the Frey girl. He looked up for a moment, his gaze falling on Elinor.</p><p>\u201cEep,\u201d Elinor squeaked, flushing with anger or longing, Gendry couldn\u2019t tell which, and ducked behind her teacup. Gendry watched the scene with interest, still holding Elinor\u2019s hand. Alyn whispered something in his date\u2019s ear before walking toward them.</p><p>\u201cOh my seven, he\u2019s coming over here!\u201d Elinor panicked, her fingers tensing. She put down her teacup and began to fiddle with a strand of her hair. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;We follow the plan.&rdquo; Gendry gave her hand a squeeze. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this. You&rsquo;re the best chaser on Slytherin\u2014you&rsquo;ve gotten the quaffle past me more times than I can count. You&rsquo;re a great girl, and if he can&rsquo;t see that, then it&rsquo;s his loss.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she gave him a small smile as she put her hand down.</p><p>\u201cNow remember, we\u2019re madly in love,\u201d he winked.</p><p>Elinor winked back, letting out a loud chuckle just as Alyn reached their table. He cleared his throat to get their attention. \u201cElinor, Gendry,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello Alyn,\u201d Elinor greeted him coolly. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard a rumor you replaced me; I was just coming to see if it was true.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Well, obviously it&rsquo;s false,&rdquo; Elinor snarked, &ldquo;since Gendry is a much better boyfriend than you ever were.&rdquo; She stroked Gendry&rsquo;s hand, gazing lovingly at his face for good measure.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Alyn crossed his gangly arms over his chest, trying to puff it out in an effort to not look like an overgrown beanpole. It wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Elinor froze, unsure how to answer such a question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s your question to ask anymore,\u201d Gendry interjected, fixing Alyn with his iciest glare. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve got something to say to her?\u201d</p><p>Alyn gaped like a fish. At last, he uncrossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI never did deserve you, Elinor; I hope he makes you happy.\u201d He shifted his weight, his gaze drifting to the floor. \u201cGuess I\u2019d better get back to my date. See you around.\u201d With one last longing glance at Elinor, Alyn pivoted back toward his own table.</p><p>Elinor waited until he made it to his table before bursting into laughter.</p><p>\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d She chortled, slapping the table. \u201cThe plan is working perfectly. You,\u201d she raised her teacup to him, \u201care an excellent actor, my dear fake boyfriend. That bit of overprotectiveness was an excellent touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d They clinked their teacups together.</p><p>Ros swung past their table again, carrying a tray of dirty dishes. \u201cI hope everything\u2019s to your liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is excellent,\u201d Elinor responded.</p><p>\u201cGreat; here\u2019s the check. I\u2019ll be by to collect it later.\u201d She dropped a tied scroll of parchment on the table. Elinor reached for her purse, but Gendry stopped her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d He pulled a few jangling coins from his pocket, dumping them on top of the table.</p><p>The bell above the door to the teashop tinkled merrily as Ros sauntered away, heralding the arrival of another couple seeking a warm pot of tea and respite from the cold. Trystane Martell entered the shop, laughing as he stamped the snow off his boots. Arya followed in behind him, her face alight with the biggest smile Gendry had seen from her in weeks. It sent a dagger straight through his heart. While she divested herself of her winter cloak, Arya looked at the restaurant\u2019s various patrons. When she noticed Gendry and Elinor, she froze; her smile disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Elinor asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Arya. On a date.\u201d</p><p>Elinor turned around to wave hello. In response, Arya gave a weak smile before returning to her date. The hostess led them to the last empty table near the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the worst friend. Why can\u2019t I be happy for her?\u201d</p><p>Elinor paused, twirling her fork as she ruminated. At length, she said, \u201cYou&rsquo;re in love with her, aren&rsquo;t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d Gendry sighed, stabbing his almond cake with more force than necessary. \u201cIt doesn&rsquo;t really matter, though; Arya will never see me as anything but a friend.\u201d He popped the cake in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure about that.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly she doesn&rsquo;t since she&rsquo;s here with Trystane.&rdquo; He shoveled in another mouthful of cake.</p><p>\u201cGendry, you dolt!\u201d Elinor smacked his arm. \u201cI know I said to keep it a secret, but maybe you should tell her that we&rsquo;re not actually together.\u201d</p><p>Gendry paused, fork halfway between his plate and his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis charade\u2019s gone on long enough as it is. I was going to suggest we \u2019break-up\u2019 next week and tell everyone we decided it would be better to stay friends anyway, now that we\u2019ve lasted a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure Alyn will want you back?\u201d Gendry took a sip of tea. It would get cold if he didn\u2019t drink it fast enough.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t really matter now. I\u2019m not going to spend my life pining after someone who doesn\u2019t want me. But you,\u201d she poked him in the chest, \u201cyou definitely need to tell Arya how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>A chair scraped across the floor elsewhere in the shop. The entire restaurant fell silent as they turned to see what the problem was. Arya stood up abruptly, face purple.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2026 you\u2026 jerk!\u201d Arya screamed, her fists clenched. Gendry knew that look; he had been on the receiving end many a time. Arya snatched her teacup from the table, hurling the steaming liquid at Trystane\u2019s chest. Without another word, she yanked her cloak off her chair, slinging it over her shoulders as she darted out the front door. The bell above the door rang violently.</p><p>Trystane blinked, pulling at his wet sweater.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going after her,\u201d Gendry told Elinor as he pushed his chair back. Pushing past tables of gobsmack patrons, he whipped on his own cloak.</p><p>The bell chimed as he stepped outside into the cold winter air. The freshly fallen snow crunched under his feet. He followed Arya&rsquo;s tracks in the snow down the main street until he lost them among the scuffle. The biting wind nipped his nose, chilling him. He pulled his cloak tighter.</p><p>Jon rounded the nearest street corner, arm in arm with Sansa. Gendry jogged up to them.</p><p>\u201cHave either of you seen Arya?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sansa pointed down a side road. \u201cI think I saw her running down that way. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gendry whispered to himself as the realization dawned on him. \u201cI\u2019m about to find out,\u201d he told Sansa. He took off at a run down the road that led to the Shrieking Shack. Close-knit houses lined the street at the beginning but began to thin out as he approached the end of the way. The shrieking shack rose up in the distance, past the fence at the end of the road. Arya curled up against the gate, her face hiding behind her knees and a curtain of dark brown hair. At the sound of his footsteps, Arya looked up, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d she sniffled, quickly rubbing the tears from her face. \u201cIf you tell anyone you saw me crying, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d He dropped down next to her. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can handle it yourself, but if you ever need me to beat someone up, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Arya smiled faintly. Gendry stood up, holding out a hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on; let\u2019s get back inside where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>He hefted her up by her icy hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They walked back down the road in silence, shoulders almost touching. Gendry flexed his hand, itching to hold hers, but put it in his pocket at the last second. The alleyway opened onto a larger street lined with quaint cottages, each blanketed with a cap of pristine snow. A lopsided snowman occupied the corner of the lawn of the last house on the street, where it crossed onto the main road. Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat snowman kind of looks like Professor Varys, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, pausing in front of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Arya chuckled. &ldquo;I feel like it&rsquo;s going to quiz me on the best methods of Occlumency.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cMiss Stark,\u201d Gendry put on his best Varys impression, \u201cwhat is the difference between\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trystane Martell barrelled around the corner, coming to a stop in front of them with a sheepish expression on his face. Arya tensed behind him. Gendry took a protective step forward, blocking Trystane from her view.</p><p>\u201cMartell.\u201d Gendry crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cGendry,\u201d Trystane blanched. \u201cHi.\u201d He peeked around Gendry\u2019s shoulder at Arya. \u201cArya, can we talk\u2014\u201d glancing up at Gendry\u2019s stony expression, he gulped before adding, \u201c\u2014alone? I need to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Arya answered after a long pause. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Gendry asked. &ldquo;I can still punch him if you want me to.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Gendry,\u201d Arya scoffed, although her eyes told a different story. \u201cBesides, if he messes up again I\u2019ll just punch him myself.\u201d</p><p>Trystane smiled faintly.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Gendry answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back at the tea shop if you need me.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya nodded before following Trystane down the snow-covered street toward the Three Broomsticks. Gendry watched them as Trystane disappeared inside the pub first. Turning around, Arya motioned for him to leave. Gendry nodded. She smiled before heading inside.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Gendry trudged back toward Madam Puddifoot\u2019s and his fake girlfriend, desperately hoping that next week\u2019s break-up wouldn\u2019t be too late.</p>",

Fresh snow blanketed the sleepy village in a sea of sparkling white. A few straggling couples wandered through the street, waiting for tables to open up at the most popular establishments. Gendry spotted his friend Jon exiting Honeyduke\u2019s with Sansa. Still no sign of Arya. Gendry sighed, turning his attention back to the laminated menu in front of him.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing this, by the way. I know it must be hard.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his menu, he peered across the table at Elinor.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that enough,\u201d Elinor continued, placing her menu down. \u201cMy break-up with Alyn almost destroyed me, but even if this doesn\u2019t end the way I want it to, I\u2019m glad to have met you, and Arya and Hot Pie too.\u201d She squeezed his hand.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Gendry responded before glancing around the tea shop. Students occupied every nook and cranny of the cramped shop floor. \u201cIt sure is crowded today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always packed this time of year.\u201d Elinor examined her pink nails.</p><p>A slender waitress sidled up to their table which was tucked in the front corner of the tea shop next to the window. \u201cWelcome to Madam Puddifoot\u2019s. My name\u2019s Ros, and I\u2019ll be your server today. Can I get you guys something to start off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the rose tea and some strawberry shortcake, thank you,\u201d Elinor flashed her a dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd for you?\u201d Ros turned to Gendry.</p><p>\u201cEarl Grey and almond cake, please,\u201d Gendry answered. Ros scribbled their orders down in a notepad before relieving them of their menus. As she disappeared into the kitchen, Gendry scanned the crowded restaurant again. His gaze landed on a suspicious couple seated near the back of the restaurant that he suspected were Robb and Dany, though it was hard to tell given their ill-fitting wigs and oversized sunglasses. A flash of silvery blonde hair peeked out from behind the girl\u2019s wig. A thick red mustache, obviously magicked into existence, covered the boy\u2019s upper lip. Gendry narrowed his eyes at the odd couple. They both waved at him and gave him two thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cWhy are Robb and Dany sitting in the back corner in disguise?\u201d Gendry whispered across the table.</p><p>\u201cDany said something about \u2018moral support\u2019 and making sure everything went according to plan when I talked to her this morning,\u201d Elinor replied. \u201cBut yes, it is a little strange that they\u2019re in such bad disguises.\u201d She examined the odd couple even closer. \u201cThose sunglasses are a little overkill.\u201d</p><p>Ros appeared at the table with a tray balanced on her hand, blocking their view of Robb and Dany. \"There you are.\u201d She placed a delicate pink teacup and saucer in front of Elinor, before putting a matching set in front of Gendry. \"Rose and Earl Grey teas.\u201d She completed the set by placing a pitcher of milk in the center of the table between them and then handed them each a slice of cake. \u201cLet me know if you need anything else.\u201d With that, Ros moved onto the next table.</p><p>Elinor dropped a spoon of sugar into her steaming cup as Gendry stabbed his almond cake with his fork. The moist cake melted in his mouth, the almond colliding with a hint of vanilla.</p><p>\u201cThis cake is delicious,\u201d Gendry moaned.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Elinor sighed. \u201cIf this place weren\u2019t such a couples spot I\u2019d probably be in here every Hogsmeade trip for the strawberry shortcake alone.\u201d</p><p>In his periphery, Robb gestured frantically at the door. Gendry raised a quizzical brow as he took a sip of his tea.</p><p>\u201cThe signal!\u201d Elinor exclaimed. She whipped her head toward the front door. \u201cAlyn must be coming in. Quick, grab my hand.\u201d Gendry almost choked on his tea when she snatched his free hand, holding it tightly. \u201cHe\u2019s got one of those dreadful Frey girls on his arm, ugh.\u201d Frowning, she glared daggers at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s unsuspecting date.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Gendry asked, placing his teacup back on its saucer.</p><p>Elinor shook her head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her gaze followed Alyn and his date as they trailed after the hostess through the restaurant to one of the tables in the back near Robb and Dany. Alyn held a chair out for the Frey girl. He looked up for a moment, his gaze falling on Elinor.</p><p>\u201cEep,\u201d Elinor squeaked, flushing with anger or longing, Gendry couldn\u2019t tell which, and ducked behind her teacup. Gendry watched the scene with interest, still holding Elinor\u2019s hand. Alyn whispered something in his date\u2019s ear before walking toward them.</p><p>\u201cOh my seven, he\u2019s coming over here!\u201d Elinor panicked, her fingers tensing. She put down her teacup and began to fiddle with a strand of her hair. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe follow the plan.\u201d Gendry gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this. You\u2019re the best chaser on Slytherin\u2014you\u2019ve gotten the quaffle past me more times than I can count. You\u2019re a great girl, and if he can\u2019t see that, then it\u2019s his loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she gave him a small smile as she put her hand down.</p><p>\u201cNow remember, we\u2019re madly in love,\u201d he winked.</p><p>Elinor winked back, letting out a loud chuckle just as Alyn reached their table. He cleared his throat to get their attention. \u201cElinor, Gendry,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello Alyn,\u201d Elinor greeted him coolly. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard a rumor you replaced me; I was just coming to see if it was true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously it\u2019s false,\u201d Elinor snarked, \u201csince Gendry is a much better boyfriend than you ever were.\u201d She stroked Gendry\u2019s hand, gazing lovingly at his face for good measure.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Alyn crossed his gangly arms over his chest, trying to puff it out in an effort to not look like an overgrown beanpole. It wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Elinor froze, unsure how to answer such a question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s your question to ask anymore,\u201d Gendry interjected, fixing Alyn with his iciest glare. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve got something to say to her?\u201d</p><p>Alyn gaped like a fish. At last, he uncrossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI never did deserve you, Elinor; I hope he makes you happy.\u201d He shifted his weight, his gaze drifting to the floor. \u201cGuess I\u2019d better get back to my date. See you around.\u201d With one last longing glance at Elinor, Alyn pivoted back toward his own table.</p><p>Elinor waited until he made it to his table before bursting into laughter.</p><p>\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d She chortled, slapping the table. \u201cThe plan is working perfectly. You,\u201d she raised her teacup to him, \u201care an excellent actor, my dear fake boyfriend. That bit of overprotectiveness was an excellent touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d They clinked their teacups together.</p><p>Ros swung past their table again, carrying a tray of dirty dishes. \u201cI hope everything\u2019s to your liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is excellent,\u201d Elinor responded.</p><p>\u201cGreat; here\u2019s the check. I\u2019ll be by to collect it later.\u201d She dropped a tied scroll of parchment on the table. Elinor reached for her purse, but Gendry stopped her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d He pulled a few jangling coins from his pocket, dumping them on top of the table.</p><p>The bell above the door to the teashop tinkled merrily as Ros sauntered away, heralding the arrival of another couple seeking a warm pot of tea and respite from the cold. Trystane Martell entered the shop, laughing as he stamped the snow off his boots. Arya followed in behind him, her face alight with the biggest smile Gendry had seen from her in weeks. It sent a dagger straight through his heart. While she divested herself of her winter cloak, Arya looked at the restaurant\u2019s various patrons. When she noticed Gendry and Elinor, she froze; her smile disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Elinor asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Arya. On a date.\u201d</p><p>Elinor turned around to wave hello. In response, Arya gave a weak smile before returning to her date. The hostess led them to the last empty table near the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the worst friend. Why can\u2019t I be happy for her?\u201d</p><p>Elinor paused, twirling her fork as she ruminated. At length, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re in love with her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d Gendry sighed, stabbing his almond cake with more force than necessary. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter, though; Arya will never see me as anything but a friend.\u201d He popped the cake in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly she doesn\u2019t since she\u2019s here with Trystane.\u201d He shoveled in another mouthful of cake.</p><p>\u201cGendry, you dolt!\u201d Elinor smacked his arm. \u201cI know I said to keep it a secret, but maybe you should tell her that we\u2019re not actually together.\u201d</p><p>Gendry paused, fork halfway between his plate and his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis charade\u2019s gone on long enough as it is. I was going to suggest we \u2019break-up\u2019 next week and tell everyone we decided it would be better to stay friends anyway, now that we\u2019ve lasted a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure Alyn will want you back?\u201d Gendry took a sip of tea. It would get cold if he didn\u2019t drink it fast enough.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t really matter now. I\u2019m not going to spend my life pining after someone who doesn\u2019t want me. But you,\u201d she poked him in the chest, \u201cyou definitely need to tell Arya how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>A chair scraped across the floor elsewhere in the shop. The entire restaurant fell silent as they turned to see what the problem was. Arya stood up abruptly, face purple.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2026 you\u2026 jerk!\u201d Arya screamed, her fists clenched. Gendry knew that look; he had been on the receiving end many a time. Arya snatched her teacup from the table, hurling the steaming liquid at Trystane\u2019s chest. Without another word, she yanked her cloak off her chair, slinging it over her shoulders as she darted out the front door. The bell above the door rang violently.</p><p>Trystane blinked, pulling at his wet sweater.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going after her,\u201d Gendry told Elinor as he pushed his chair back. Pushing past tables of gobsmack patrons, he whipped on his own cloak.</p><p>The bell chimed as he stepped outside into the cold winter air. The freshly fallen snow crunched under his feet. He followed Arya\u2019s tracks in the snow down the main street until he lost them among the scuffle. The biting wind nipped his nose, chilling him. He pulled his cloak tighter.</p><p>Jon rounded the nearest street corner, arm in arm with Sansa. Gendry jogged up to them.</p><p>\u201cHave either of you seen Arya?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sansa pointed down a side road. \u201cI think I saw her running down that way. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gendry whispered to himself as the realization dawned on him. \u201cI\u2019m about to find out,\u201d he told Sansa. He took off at a run down the road that led to the Shrieking Shack. Close-knit houses lined the street at the beginning but began to thin out as he approached the end of the way. The shrieking shack rose up in the distance, past the fence at the end of the road. Arya curled up against the gate, her face hiding behind her knees and a curtain of dark brown hair. At the sound of his footsteps, Arya looked up, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d she sniffled, quickly rubbing the tears from her face. \u201cIf you tell anyone you saw me crying, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d He dropped down next to her. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can handle it yourself, but if you ever need me to beat someone up, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Arya smiled faintly. Gendry stood up, holding out a hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on; let\u2019s get back inside where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>He hefted her up by her icy hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They walked back down the road in silence, shoulders almost touching. Gendry flexed his hand, itching to hold hers, but put it in his pocket at the last second. The alleyway opened onto a larger street lined with quaint cottages, each blanketed with a cap of pristine snow. A lopsided snowman occupied the corner of the lawn of the last house on the street, where it crossed onto the main road. Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat snowman kind of looks like Professor Varys, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, pausing in front of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Arya chuckled. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to quiz me on the best methods of Occlumency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Stark,\u201d Gendry put on his best Varys impression, \u201cwhat is the difference between\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trystane Martell barrelled around the corner, coming to a stop in front of them with a sheepish expression on his face. Arya tensed behind him. Gendry took a protective step forward, blocking Trystane from her view.</p><p>\u201cMartell.\u201d Gendry crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cGendry,\u201d Trystane blanched. \u201cHi.\u201d He peeked around Gendry\u2019s shoulder at Arya. \u201cArya, can we talk\u2014\u201d glancing up at Gendry\u2019s stony expression, he gulped before adding, \u201c\u2014alone?

Fresh snow blanketed the sleepy village in a sea of sparkling white. A few straggling couples wandered through the street, waiting for tables to open up at the most popular establishments. Gendry spotted his friend Jon exiting Honeyduke\u2019s with Sansa. Still no sign of Arya. Gendry sighed, turning his attention back to the laminated menu in front of him.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing this, by the way. I know it must be hard.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his menu, he peered across the table at Elinor.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that enough,\u201d Elinor continued, placing her menu down. \u201cMy break-up with Alyn almost destroyed me, but even if this doesn\u2019t end the way I want it to, I\u2019m glad to have met you, and Arya and Hot Pie too.\u201d She squeezed his hand.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Gendry responded before glancing around the tea shop. Students occupied every nook and cranny of the cramped shop floor. \u201cIt sure is crowded today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always packed this time of year.\u201d Elinor examined her pink nails.</p><p>A slender waitress sidled up to their table which was tucked in the front corner of the tea shop next to the window. \u201cWelcome to Madam Puddifoot\u2019s. My name\u2019s Ros, and I\u2019ll be your server today. Can I get you guys something to start off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the rose tea and some strawberry shortcake, thank you,\u201d Elinor flashed her a dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd for you?\u201d Ros turned to Gendry.</p><p>\u201cEarl Grey and almond cake, please,\u201d Gendry answered. Ros scribbled their orders down in a notepad before relieving them of their menus. As she disappeared into the kitchen, Gendry scanned the crowded restaurant again. His gaze landed on a suspicious couple seated near the back of the restaurant that he suspected were Robb and Dany, though it was hard to tell given their ill-fitting wigs and oversized sunglasses. A flash of silvery blonde hair peeked out from behind the girl\u2019s wig. A thick red mustache, obviously magicked into existence, covered the boy\u2019s upper lip. Gendry narrowed his eyes at the odd couple. They both waved at him and gave him two thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cWhy are Robb and Dany sitting in the back corner in disguise?\u201d Gendry whispered across the table.</p><p>\u201cDany said something about \u2018moral support\u2019 and making sure everything went according to plan when I talked to her this morning,\u201d Elinor replied. \u201cBut yes, it is a little strange that they\u2019re in such bad disguises.\u201d She examined the odd couple even closer. \u201cThose sunglasses are a little overkill.\u201d</p><p>Ros appeared at the table with a tray balanced on her hand, blocking their view of Robb and Dany. \"There you are.\u201d She placed a delicate pink teacup and saucer in front of Elinor, before putting a matching set in front of Gendry. \"Rose and Earl Grey teas.\u201d She completed the set by placing a pitcher of milk in the center of the table between them and then handed them each a slice of cake. \u201cLet me know if you need anything else.\u201d With that, Ros moved onto the next table.</p><p>Elinor dropped a spoon of sugar into her steaming cup as Gendry stabbed his almond cake with his fork. The moist cake melted in his mouth, the almond colliding with a hint of vanilla.</p><p>\u201cThis cake is delicious,\u201d Gendry moaned.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Elinor sighed. \u201cIf this place weren\u2019t such a couples spot I\u2019d probably be in here every Hogsmeade trip for the strawberry shortcake alone.\u201d</p><p>In his periphery, Robb gestured frantically at the door. Gendry raised a quizzical brow as he took a sip of his tea.</p><p>\u201cThe signal!\u201d Elinor exclaimed. She whipped her head toward the front door. \u201cAlyn must be coming in. Quick, grab my hand.\u201d Gendry almost choked on his tea when she snatched his free hand, holding it tightly. \u201cHe\u2019s got one of those dreadful Frey girls on his arm, ugh.\u201d Frowning, she glared daggers at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s unsuspecting date.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Gendry asked, placing his teacup back on its saucer.</p><p>Elinor shook her head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her gaze followed Alyn and his date as they trailed after the hostess through the restaurant to one of the tables in the back near Robb and Dany. Alyn held a chair out for the Frey girl. He looked up for a moment, his gaze falling on Elinor.</p><p>\u201cEep,\u201d Elinor squeaked, flushing with anger or longing, Gendry couldn\u2019t tell which, and ducked behind her teacup. Gendry watched the scene with interest, still holding Elinor\u2019s hand. Alyn whispered something in his date\u2019s ear before walking toward them.</p><p>\u201cOh my seven, he\u2019s coming over here!\u201d Elinor panicked, her fingers tensing. She put down her teacup and began to fiddle with a strand of her hair. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe follow the plan.\u201d Gendry gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this. You\u2019re the best chaser on Slytherin\u2014you\u2019ve gotten the quaffle past me more times than I can count. You\u2019re a great girl, and if he can\u2019t see that, then it\u2019s his loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she gave him a small smile as she put her hand down.</p><p>\u201cNow remember, we\u2019re madly in love,\u201d he winked.</p><p>Elinor winked back, letting out a loud chuckle just as Alyn reached their table. He cleared his throat to get their attention. \u201cElinor, Gendry,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello Alyn,\u201d Elinor greeted him coolly. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard a rumor you replaced me; I was just coming to see if it was true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously it\u2019s false,\u201d Elinor snarked, \u201csince Gendry is a much better boyfriend than you ever were.\u201d She stroked Gendry\u2019s hand, gazing lovingly at his face for good measure.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Alyn crossed his gangly arms over his chest, trying to puff it out in an effort to not look like an overgrown beanpole. It wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Elinor froze, unsure how to answer such a question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s your question to ask anymore,\u201d Gendry interjected, fixing Alyn with his iciest glare. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve got something to say to her?\u201d</p><p>Alyn gaped like a fish. At last, he uncrossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI never did deserve you, Elinor; I hope he makes you happy.\u201d He shifted his weight, his gaze drifting to the floor. \u201cGuess I\u2019d better get back to my date. See you around.\u201d With one last longing glance at Elinor, Alyn pivoted back toward his own table.</p><p>Elinor waited until he made it to his table before bursting into laughter.</p><p>\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d She chortled, slapping the table. \u201cThe plan is working perfectly. You,\u201d she raised her teacup to him, \u201care an excellent actor, my dear fake boyfriend. That bit of overprotectiveness was an excellent touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d They clinked their teacups together.</p><p>Ros swung past their table again, carrying a tray of dirty dishes. \u201cI hope everything\u2019s to your liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is excellent,\u201d Elinor responded.</p><p>\u201cGreat; here\u2019s the check. I\u2019ll be by to collect it later.\u201d She dropped a tied scroll of parchment on the table. Elinor reached for her purse, but Gendry stopped her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d He pulled a few jangling coins from his pocket, dumping them on top of the table.</p><p>The bell above the door to the teashop tinkled merrily as Ros sauntered away, heralding the arrival of another couple seeking a warm pot of tea and respite from the cold. Trystane Martell entered the shop, laughing as he stamped the snow off his boots. Arya followed in behind him, her face alight with the biggest smile Gendry had seen from her in weeks. It sent a dagger straight through his heart. While she divested herself of her winter cloak, Arya looked at the restaurant\u2019s various patrons. When she noticed Gendry and Elinor, she froze; her smile disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Elinor asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Arya. On a date.\u201d</p><p>Elinor turned around to wave hello. In response, Arya gave a weak smile before returning to her date. The hostess led them to the last empty table near the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the worst friend. Why can\u2019t I be happy for her?\u201d</p><p>Elinor paused, twirling her fork as she ruminated. At length, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re in love with her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d Gendry sighed, stabbing his almond cake with more force than necessary. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter, though; Arya will never see me as anything but a friend.\u201d He popped the cake in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly she doesn\u2019t since she\u2019s here with Trystane.\u201d He shoveled in another mouthful of cake.</p><p>\u201cGendry, you dolt!\u201d Elinor smacked his arm. \u201cI know I said to keep it a secret, but maybe you should tell her that we\u2019re not actually together.\u201d</p><p>Gendry paused, fork halfway between his plate and his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis charade\u2019s gone on long enough as it is. I was going to suggest we \u2019break-up\u2019 next week and tell everyone we decided it would be better to stay friends anyway, now that we\u2019ve lasted a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure Alyn will want you back?\u201d Gendry took a sip of tea. It would get cold if he didn\u2019t drink it fast enough.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t really matter now. I\u2019m not going to spend my life pining after someone who doesn\u2019t want me. But you,\u201d she poked him in the chest, \u201cyou definitely need to tell Arya how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>A chair scraped across the floor elsewhere in the shop. The entire restaurant fell silent as they turned to see what the problem was. Arya stood up abruptly, face purple.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2026 you\u2026 jerk!\u201d Arya screamed, her fists clenched. Gendry knew that look; he had been on the receiving end many a time. Arya snatched her teacup from the table, hurling the steaming liquid at Trystane\u2019s chest. Without another word, she yanked her cloak off her chair, slinging it over her shoulders as she darted out the front door. The bell above the door rang violently.</p><p>Trystane blinked, pulling at his wet sweater.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going after her,\u201d Gendry told Elinor as he pushed his chair back. Pushing past tables of gobsmack patrons, he whipped on his own cloak.</p><p>The bell chimed as he stepped outside into the cold winter air. The freshly fallen snow crunched under his feet. He followed Arya\u2019s tracks in the snow down the main street until he lost them among the scuffle. The biting wind nipped his nose, chilling him. He pulled his cloak tighter.</p><p>Jon rounded the nearest street corner, arm in arm with Sansa. Gendry jogged up to them.</p><p>\u201cHave either of you seen Arya?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sansa pointed down a side road. \u201cI think I saw her running down that way. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gendry whispered to himself as the realization dawned on him. \u201cI\u2019m about to find out,\u201d he told Sansa. He took off at a run down the road that led to the Shrieking Shack. Close-knit houses lined the street at the beginning but began to thin out as he approached the end of the way. The shrieking shack rose up in the distance, past the fence at the end of the road. Arya curled up against the gate, her face hiding behind her knees and a curtain of dark brown hair. At the sound of his footsteps, Arya looked up, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d she sniffled, quickly rubbing the tears from her face. \u201cIf you tell anyone you saw me crying, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d He dropped down next to her. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can handle it yourself, but if you ever need me to beat someone up, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Arya smiled faintly. Gendry stood up, holding out a hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on; let\u2019s get back inside where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>He hefted her up by her icy hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They walked back down the road in silence, shoulders almost touching. Gendry flexed his hand, itching to hold hers, but put it in his pocket at the last second. The alleyway opened onto a larger street lined with quaint cottages, each blanketed with a cap of pristine snow. A lopsided snowman occupied the corner of the lawn of the last house on the street, where it crossed onto the main road. Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat snowman kind of looks like Professor Varys, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, pausing in front of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Arya chuckled. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to quiz me on the best methods of Occlumency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Stark,\u201d Gendry put on his best Varys impression, \u201cwhat is the difference between\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trystane Martell barrelled around the corner, coming to a stop in front of them with a sheepish expression on his face. Arya tensed behind him. Gendry took a protective step forward, blocking Trystane from her view.</p><p>\u201cMartell.\u201d Gendry crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cGendry,\u201d Trystane blanched. \u201cHi.\u201d He peeked around Gendry\u2019s shoulder at Arya. \u201cArya, can we talk\u2014\u201d glancing up at Gendry\u2019s stony expression, he gulped before adding, \u201c\u2014alone? I need to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Arya answered after a long pause. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Gendry asked. \u201cI can still punch him if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Gendry,\u201d Arya scoffed, although her eyes told a different story. \u201cBesides, if he messes up again I\u2019ll just punch him myself.\u201d</p><p>Trystane smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Gendry answered. \u201cI\u2019ll be back at the tea shop if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Arya nodded before following Trystane down the snow-covered street toward the Three Broomsticks. Gendry watched them as Trystane disappeared inside the pub first. Turning around, Arya motioned for him to leave. Gendry nodded. She smiled before heading inside.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Gendry trudged back toward Madam Puddifoot\u2019s and his fake girlfriend, desperately hoping that next week\u2019s break-up wouldn\u2019t be too late.</p>",

I know it must be hard.&rdquo;</p><p>Lowering his menu, he peered across the table at Elinor.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that enough,&rdquo; Elinor continued, placing her menu down. &ldquo;My break-up with Alyn almost destroyed me, but even if this doesn&rsquo;t end the way I want it to, I&rsquo;m glad to have met you, and Arya and Hot Pie too.&rdquo; She squeezed his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; Gendry responded before glancing around the tea shop. Students occupied every nook and cranny of the cramped shop floor. &ldquo;It sure is crowded today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always packed this time of year.&rdquo; Elinor examined her pink nails.</p><p>A slender waitress sidled up to their table which was tucked in the front corner of the tea shop next to the window. &ldquo;Welcome to Madam Puddifoot&rsquo;s. My name&rsquo;s Ros, and I&rsquo;ll be your server today. Can I get you guys something to start off?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the rose tea and some strawberry shortcake, thank you,&rdquo; Elinor flashed her a dazzling smile.</p><p>&ldquo;And for you?&rdquo; Ros turned to Gendry.</p><p>&ldquo;Earl Grey and almond cake, please,&rdquo; Gendry answered. Ros scribbled their orders down in a notepad before relieving them of their menus. As she disappeared into the kitchen, Gendry scanned the crowded restaurant again. His gaze landed on a suspicious couple seated near the back of the restaurant that he suspected were Robb and Dany, though it was hard to tell given their ill-fitting wigs and oversized sunglasses. A flash of silvery blonde hair peeked out from behind the girl&rsquo;s wig. A thick red mustache, obviously magicked into existence, covered the boy&rsquo;s upper lip. Gendry narrowed his eyes at the odd couple. They both waved at him and gave him two thumbs up.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are Robb and Dany sitting in the back corner in disguise?&rdquo; Gendry whispered across the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Dany said something about &lsquo;moral support&rsquo; and making sure everything went according to plan when I talked to her this morning,&rdquo; Elinor replied. &ldquo;But yes, it is a little strange that they&rsquo;re in such bad disguises.&rdquo; She examined the odd couple even closer. &ldquo;Those sunglasses are a little overkill.&rdquo;</p><p>Ros appeared at the table with a tray balanced on her hand, blocking their view of Robb and Dany. \"There you are.&rdquo; She placed a delicate pink teacup and saucer in front of Elinor, before putting a matching set in front of Gendry. \"Rose and Earl Grey teas.&rdquo; She completed the set by placing a pitcher of milk in the center of the table between them and then handed them each a slice of cake. &ldquo;Let me know if you need anything else.&rdquo; With that, Ros moved onto the next table.</p><p>Elinor dropped a spoon of sugar into her steaming cup as Gendry stabbed his almond cake with his fork. The moist cake melted in his mouth, the almond colliding with a hint of vanilla.</p><p>&ldquo;This cake is delicious,&rdquo; Gendry moaned.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Elinor sighed. &ldquo;If this place weren&rsquo;t such a couples spot I&rsquo;d probably be in here every Hogsmeade trip for the strawberry shortcake alone.&rdquo;</p><p>In his periphery, Robb gestured frantically at the door. Gendry raised a quizzical brow as he took a sip of his tea.</p><p>&ldquo;The signal!&rdquo; Elinor exclaimed. She whipped her head toward the front door. &ldquo;Alyn must be coming in. Quick, grab my hand.&rdquo; Gendry almost choked on his tea when she snatched his free hand, holding it tightly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got one of those dreadful Frey girls on his arm, ugh.&rdquo; Frowning, she glared daggers at her ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s unsuspecting date.</p><p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; Gendry asked, placing his teacup back on its saucer.</p><p>Elinor shook her head. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Her gaze followed Alyn and his date as they trailed after the hostess through the restaurant to one of the tables in the back near Robb and Dany. Alyn held a chair out for the Frey girl. He looked up for a moment, his gaze falling on Elinor.</p><p>&ldquo;Eep,&rdquo; Elinor squeaked, flushing with anger or longing, Gendry couldn&rsquo;t tell which, and ducked behind her teacup. Gendry watched the scene with interest, still holding Elinor&rsquo;s hand. Alyn whispered something in his date&rsquo;s ear before walking toward them.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my seven, he&rsquo;s coming over here!&rdquo; Elinor panicked, her fingers tensing. She put down her teacup and began to fiddle with a strand of her hair. &ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We follow the plan.&rdquo; Gendry gave her hand a squeeze. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this. You&rsquo;re the best chaser on Slytherin&mdash;you&rsquo;ve gotten the quaffle past me more times than I can count. You&rsquo;re a great girl, and if he can&rsquo;t see that, then it&rsquo;s his loss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she gave him a small smile as she put her hand down.</p><p>&ldquo;Now remember, we&rsquo;re madly in love,&rdquo; he winked.</p><p>Elinor winked back, letting out a loud chuckle just as Alyn reached their table. He cleared his throat to get their attention. &ldquo;Elinor, Gendry,&rdquo; he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hello Alyn,&rdquo; Elinor greeted him coolly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard a rumor you replaced me; I was just coming to see if it was true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, obviously it&rsquo;s false,&rdquo; Elinor snarked, &ldquo;since Gendry is a much better boyfriend than you ever were.&rdquo; She stroked Gendry&rsquo;s hand, gazing lovingly at his face for good measure.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you love him?&rdquo; Alyn crossed his gangly arms over his chest, trying to puff it out in an effort to not look like an overgrown beanpole. It wasn&rsquo;t working.</p><p>Elinor froze, unsure how to answer such a question.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s your question to ask anymore,&rdquo; Gendry interjected, fixing Alyn with his iciest glare. &ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;ve got something to say to her?&rdquo;</p><p>Alyn gaped like a fish. At last, he uncrossed his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never did deserve you, Elinor; I hope he makes you happy.&rdquo; He shifted his weight, his gaze drifting to the floor. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;d better get back to my date. See you around.&rdquo; With one last longing glance at Elinor, Alyn pivoted back toward his own table.</p><p>Elinor waited until he made it to his table before bursting into laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you see his face?&rdquo; She chortled, slapping the table. &ldquo;The plan is working perfectly. You,&rdquo; she raised her teacup to him, &ldquo;are an excellent actor, my dear fake boyfriend. That bit of overprotectiveness was an excellent touch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; They clinked their teacups together.</p><p>Ros swung past their table again, carrying a tray of dirty dishes. &ldquo;I hope everything&rsquo;s to your liking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is excellent,&rdquo; Elinor responded.</p><p>&ldquo;Great; here&rsquo;s the check. I&rsquo;ll be by to collect it later.&rdquo; She dropped a tied scroll of parchment on the table. Elinor reached for her purse, but Gendry stopped her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo; He pulled a few jangling coins from his pocket, dumping them on top of the table.</p><p>The bell above the door to the teashop tinkled merrily as Ros sauntered away, heralding the arrival of another couple seeking a warm pot of tea and respite from the cold. Trystane Martell entered the shop, laughing as he stamped the snow off his boots. Arya followed in behind him, her face alight with the biggest smile Gendry had seen from her in weeks. It sent a dagger straight through his heart. While she divested herself of her winter cloak, Arya looked at the restaurant&rsquo;s various patrons. When she noticed Gendry and Elinor, she froze; her smile disappeared.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Elinor asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Arya. On a date.&rdquo;</p><p>Elinor turned around to wave hello. In response, Arya gave a weak smile before returning to her date. The hostess led them to the last empty table near the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the worst friend. Why can&rsquo;t I be happy for her?&rdquo;</p><p>Elinor paused, twirling her fork as she ruminated. At length, she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love with her, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo; Gendry sighed, stabbing his almond cake with more force than necessary. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, though; Arya will never see me as anything but a friend.&rdquo; He popped the cake in his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly she doesn&rsquo;t since she&rsquo;s here with Trystane.&rdquo; He shoveled in another mouthful of cake.</p><p>&ldquo;Gendry, you dolt!&rdquo; Elinor smacked his arm. &ldquo;I know I said to keep it a secret, but maybe you should tell her that we&rsquo;re not actually together.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry paused, fork halfway between his plate and his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;This charade&rsquo;s gone on long enough as it is. I was going to suggest we &rsquo;break-up&rsquo; next week and tell everyone we decided it would be better to stay friends anyway, now that we&rsquo;ve lasted a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure Alyn will want you back?&rdquo; Gendry took a sip of tea. It would get cold if he didn&rsquo;t drink it fast enough.</p><p>&ldquo;No, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter now. I&rsquo;m not going to spend my life pining after someone who doesn&rsquo;t want me. But you,&rdquo; she poked him in the chest, &ldquo;you definitely need to tell Arya how you feel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p><p>A chair scraped across the floor elsewhere in the shop. The entire restaurant fell silent as they turned to see what the problem was. Arya stood up abruptly, face purple.</p><p>&ldquo;You &hellip; you&hellip; jerk!&rdquo; Arya screamed, her fists clenched. Gendry knew that look; he had been on the receiving end many a time. Arya snatched her teacup from the table, hurling the steaming liquid at Trystane&rsquo;s chest. Without another word, she yanked her cloak off her chair, slinging it over her shoulders as she darted out the front door. The bell above the door rang violently.</p><p>Trystane blinked, pulling at his wet sweater.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after her,&rdquo; Gendry told Elinor as he pushed his chair back. Pushing past tables of gobsmack patrons, he whipped on his own cloak.</p><p>The bell chimed as he stepped outside into the cold winter air. The freshly fallen snow crunched under his feet. He followed Arya&rsquo;s tracks in the snow down the main street until he lost them among the scuffle. The biting wind nipped his nose, chilling him. He pulled his cloak tighter.</p><p>Jon rounded the nearest street corner, arm in arm with Sansa. Gendry jogged up to them.</p><p>&ldquo;Have either of you seen Arya?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Sansa pointed down a side road. &ldquo;I think I saw her running down that way. Is something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Gendry whispered to himself as the realization dawned on him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to find out,&rdquo; he told Sansa. He took off at a run down the road that led to the Shrieking Shack. Close-knit houses lined the street at the beginning but began to thin out as he approached the end of the way. The shrieking shack rose up in the distance, past the fence at the end of the road. Arya curled up against the gate, her face hiding behind her knees and a curtain of dark brown hair. At the sound of his footsteps, Arya looked up, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; she sniffled, quickly rubbing the tears from her face. &ldquo;If you tell anyone you saw me crying, I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;My lips are sealed.&rdquo; He dropped down next to her. &ldquo;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not particularly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you can handle it yourself, but if you ever need me to beat someone up, I&rsquo;d do it in a heartbeat.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya smiled faintly. Gendry stood up, holding out a hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on; let&rsquo;s get back inside where it&rsquo;s warm.&rdquo;</p><p>He hefted her up by her icy hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>They walked back down the road in silence, shoulders almost touching. Gendry flexed his hand, itching to hold hers, but put it in his pocket at the last second. The alleyway opened onto a larger street lined with quaint cottages, each blanketed with a cap of pristine snow. A lopsided snowman occupied the corner of the lawn of the last house on the street, where it crossed onto the main road. Gendry laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;That snowman kind of looks like Professor Varys, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said, pausing in front of it.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Arya chuckled. &ldquo;I feel like it&rsquo;s going to quiz me on the best methods of Occlumency.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Stark,&rdquo; Gendry put on his best Varys impression, &ldquo;what is the difference between&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Trystane Martell barrelled around the corner, coming to a stop in front of them with a sheepish expression on his face. Arya tensed behind him. Gendry took a protective step forward, blocking Trystane from her view.</p><p>&ldquo;Martell.&rdquo; Gendry crossed his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Gendry,&rdquo; Trystane blanched. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; He peeked around Gendry&rsquo;s shoulder at Arya. &ldquo;Arya, can we talk&mdash;&rdquo; glancing up at Gendry&rsquo;s stony expression, he gulped before adding, &ldquo;&mdash;alone? I need to apologize.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya answered after a long pause. &ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Gendry asked. &ldquo;I can still punch him if you want me to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine, Gendry,&rdquo; Arya scoffed, although her eyes told a different story. &ldquo;Besides, if he messes up again I&rsquo;ll just punch him myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Trystane smiled faintly.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Gendry answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back at the tea shop if you need me.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya nodded before following Trystane down the snow-covered street toward the Three Broomsticks. Gendry watched them as Trystane disappeared inside the pub first. Turning around, Arya motioned for him to leave. Gendry nodded. She smiled before heading inside.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Gendry trudged back toward Madam Puddifoot&rsquo;s and his fake girlfriend, desperately hoping that next week&rsquo;s break-up wouldn&rsquo;t be too late.</p>",

        "question": "Loving your Gendrya head canon. Given that Gendry is aware that Arya is traumatized, when do you think she told him about everything that happened during their years apart? How does he respond? I was dying to see some of this on the show. Something else I\u2019ve always wondered -did Gendry ever realize how abandoned Arya felt when he chose the Brotherhood over her?",
        "answer": "<p>Thank you! That\u2019s a good question and I\u2019m still angry we didn\u2019t get to see that conversation on the show too. Gendry is perhaps the one person Arya feels most comfortable being vulnerable around so I have a feeling she tells him pretty soon after their reunion.

She\u2019s sobbing through it and Gendry is holding her tight and stroking her hair, just being the silent rock keeping her grounded as she lets it all out. But he\u2019s completely gutted inside\u2013feels like he wants to kill someone and throw up at the same time, and he can\u2019t stop himself from wondering if he could\u2019ve protected her from all of it had he not left her for the Brotherhood which makes him feel worse. That night, he vows to shield her from any future pain and do whatever is necessary to help her heal, which is why he encourages her to leave Westeros for a while. </p><p>To answer your other question, I think Gendry\u2019s always known how abandoned she felt when he chose to stay with the Brotherhood.

In the books, I believe Gendry is the one calling after her when she runs away, and I think he realized she ran because she felt abandoned and alone. I also think him staying with Lady Stoneheart is partially penance for him. He chose the Brotherhood in the first place because he admired the honor they displayed by giving Clegane a trial as opposed to just killing him, but Lady Stoneheart\u2019s revenge-fueled rampage is very contradictory to that. So he\u2019s sacrificing a bit of his honor by staying with her, and I think a part of it is to atone for abandoning Arya and to keep that connection with her. He probably thinks she\u2019s either dead or being tortured by Ramsay, so he\u2019s furious at the world for taking the light of his life away but maybe also hates himself a little bit too because he wasn\u2019t there for her when she needed him most.</p><p><i><b>Check out my gendrya headcanon (<a href=\"https://aryaofhousesnark.tumblr.com/post/185592966585/i-would-just-like-to-say-that-gendrya-is-canon-and\">x</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://aryaofhousesnark.tumblr.com/post/185595589305/your-head-canon-is-perfect-it-even-explains-her\">x</a>) and ask me more questions!</b></i></p>",
