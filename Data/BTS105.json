Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment In Life</b></h2><p>Jin stands on the beach, arms resting on the hood of his truck as he stares out at the ocean. The bitter wind whips his hair in his eyes and fills his head with the smells of salt and seaweed. You\u2019d never know it\u2019s the end of \u00a0summer. The sky is an anemic gray, the water dull and choppy. Its chaotic churning matches the whirlwind in his stomach. His fingers shake and he can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from the cold or the anxiety that seems to pulse through him like a live wire.</p><p>He\u2019s been gone all summer, doing a program abroad in Japan and he\u2019s supposed to start his third year of university in just a couple weeks. But here he is on the beach because they always meet up here. It\u2019s tradition. Every summer they mourn/celebrate the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. They spend the day at the beach, goofing off, having a big bonfire and staying out all night. It\u2019s always been like this. All seven of them, together every year. Even though they hang out all season, the annual end of summer beach day seems almost like a reunion of sorts.</p><p>But after everything that happened\u2026will any of them even show up? Jin feels the blood drain from his face as the terrible thought he\u2019s been trying to avoid suddenly appears in his mind. Will anyone <i>not</i> show up?</p><p>With a quick clench of his fists, he pushes off his truck and runs his hands through his hair. He\u2019s been absent this summer, even before then he was going to school full-time and was really only able to see his friends on the weekends and some holidays. And with how little he saw them, they all seemed worse every time he came around. There was nothing subtle about the change in each of their lives. And nothing he could do to help them. He watched each of them slip further and there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>There was nothing he could do.</p><p>With each passing week, the gap between he and the others grew and before too long, he felt like an outsider, a fly on the wall observing rather than being a part of it. And then that whole thing with Yoongi. With Tae and his dad. And Jungkook and Jimin\u2026and Hoseok\u2026</p><p>He sucks in a sharp breath, his heart clenching like a cold fist in his ribcage as he stumbles to the cab of his truck and throws the door open. He rummages for a few seconds through the food wrappers and trash on the floor on the passenger side before finding his red notebook. Then he slams the door shut again, drops the journal open on the hood and begins to write.</p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Do you remember how it used to be? How we fit like a seven piece puzzle? Chaotic and messy on our own but a perfect picture when we were together\u2026</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e1e64d5e71c4589422ce26aed1d979e/tumblr_inline_plrieo6tIs1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp3xbm2p1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>02. Hold Me Tight</b></h2><p><i>We were nothing until we became something. And we were only something when we were with each other.</i></p><p><b>One Year Ago.</b></p><p>Kim Seokjin sat in the bed of his truck, back against the cab, his red journal propped up on his legs as he scratched his pen across the lined paper. He\u2019d always loved writing. It was why he\u2019d decided to become an english major. This notebook had been a gift from his parents, inexpensive but meaningful. A symbol of their support of him pursuing a passion with little promise of fame or fortune. He didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s what he loved.</p><p>Every so often, he lifted his eyes from the page and stared out at the ocean. At the expanse of sea, glittering in the sunlight. Beach day was always his favorite day. Sure, it signaled the end of the summer, and the air, though still warm, carried the faintest bite of autumn, but it was a day for him to spend with his six best friends. The ones that he\u2019d shared his life with for the past five years. Sure, his friendship with them looked different now than it did back then. Life had been a harsh beast, threatening many times to rip them apart but they always prevailed and their bond had become stronger every time because of it.</p><p>\u201cJin-hyung!\u201d</p><p>Jin tore his eyes from the water to look further down the beach and a smile spread across his face when he saw two obscured figures making their way toward him. One tall and lanky, the other shrouded in a black hoodie. Namjoon and Taehyung.</p><p>He climbed out of the bed of his truck and tensed his body as the two younger boys reached him and lunged, each throwing their arms around him and causing him to stumble back.</p><p>\u201cYah!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019d think we haven\u2019t seen each other in a decade.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung smiled, his mouth shaping into a rectangular grin that the rest of the boys had come to love. \u201cAnother year, another Beach Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019re off to school again tomorrow,\u201d Namjoon added mussing up the older boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>Jin ducked out from beneath his arm and patted his hair back into place. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m moving across the country. I\u2019ll still be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch less though,\u201d Taehyung said. \u00a0Jin\u2019s eyes lingered on the ugly purple bruise blooming around the boy\u2019s left eye, at the cut on his lip that split open when he had smiled. With a quick swipe of his sleeve, Taehyung wiped the blood away that had welled up. How many stains were hidden by the dark fabric of his black hoodie?</p><p>The three of them heard more shouts and laughter and turned to find their other four friends running toward them, hair and clothes whipping in the harsh wind. A few more yards and the seven of them were together again, as it should be. As it always should be.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah\u201d Taehyung yelled to the youngest boy as he flung his arms around him. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother!\u201d Jungkook yelled back and dramatically threw his body against him in a crushing hug. \u201cWhere have you been all my life?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked again to Jin. \u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cJungkook-ah gets it.\u201d</p><p>Jin could only laugh as he watched the hug turn into a power struggle in the sand. The wrestling match quickly became a dog pile as Jimin, the third youngest, jumped on top, followed by Hoseok and finally the second oldest, Yoongi. Namjoon, more of a lover than a fighter, stood back with Jin, arms folded across his chest as he looked fondly down at their friends.</p><p>They spent the day together there on the empty beach. Seven friends drawing messages in the sand, racing each other along the shore, eating junk, wrestling and laughing, their normal lives forgotten, washed away by the crashing waves. By the time the sun was setting, their throats hurt from screaming, their limbs ached, their eyes burned but it was the happiest they\u2019d been all year. It was a day to forget the present and live in the good times of the past and the possibilities of the future.</p><p>It grew dark. Not pitch dark. A bright darkness that made the sky a cobalt blue and everything else a crisp black. All they could smell was the tang of sea salt, all they could hear was the breaking of waves as they all lay in the sand and looked up at the stars. The world seems to spin a bit slower at night. The temperature had plunged when the sun set and when they finally couldn\u2019t stand the cold anymore, they built a bonfire right there on the beach.</p><p>For hours the seven of them joked around, brought up funny memories, burst into song and played games, the punishment always the same, taking a dip in the frigid ocean. Before long, all of them were damp, their hair plastered to their foreheads in wet, salty strands. At last, sleepiness began to settle over the group, sending them all into silence. No one wanted to acknowledge that Beach Day was coming to a close. Everyone dreaded returning to the real world the next day.</p><p>After several minutes of silence passed, Hoseok finally sucked in a sharp breath and got to his feet. \u201cI brought something,\u201d he said digging into his pocket. When he pulled his hand back out, it was wrapped around a plastic baggie of pills. The rest of the group watched with bated breath. \u201cI feel like this is a good moment to start over,\u201d he said as he watched the flames lick at the cold air. \u201cAnd what\u2019s a better way to start over than getting rid of the temptation entirely, right?\u201d His eyes lifted to peer around the circle. The others nodded, a few of them giving him small smiles of cautious encouragement. The boy had been struggling with addiction for years. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d decided to quit cold-turkey. But they all clung to the hope that it was the last.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help you through this, hyung,\u201d Jimin said with a determined nod. Hoseok smiled back, his eyes glittering at the promise.</p><p>Then with his own definitive nod, he opened the baggie and turned it upside down over the fire. The others cheered as his smile became wider. At last he stuffed the empty bag back in his pocket and fell back down into the sand. Yoongi clapped him hard on the back and Jimin leaned into him, nuzzling his side until he lifted his arm and slung it over the younger\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Jin smiled from where he leaned against the tailgate of his truck, his eyes scanning his circle of friends. The next morning he was heading off to college. Sure, his dorm wasn\u2019t far and he planned on coming home on the weekends but\u2026</p><p>His eyes flew to the dark bruise on Taehyung\u2019s face, to the pale, sallowness of Jimin\u2019s cheeks, to the threadbare places on Namjoon\u2019s old clothes, to the dark stress circles under Yoongi\u2019s eyes, to Jungkook wearing Yoongi&rsquo;s sweatshirt providing him the comfort he doesn&rsquo;t often receive at home</p><p>\u2026he couldn\u2019t help but worry about them. They had a much rougher life than he did and though he did what he could to help, he was afraid that life was getting the best of them. And there was only so much he could do to try and keep their heads above water before he too might sink and they all would drown.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b01174d4d534042dd630624274c053fe/tumblr_inline_plrii1jMao1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrovgkPsj1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>03. Autumn Leaves</b></h2><p><i>Apart, we were fragmented but together, we were unbreakable. And that was all we needed. Until it wasn\u2019t.</i></p><p><b>November.</b><br/></p><p>School had always been hard for Park Jimin. Luckily, the fact that Jungkook and Taehyung were almost constantly by his side made it bearable. They were his best friends and protectors against those that liked to pick on him because of how small he was. It wasn\u2019t his fault that when the other boys hit puberty, they sprung up like weeds while he stayed closer to the ground. Though the taunting, the name calling, the abuse, made it feel to him like it was his fault. Like he should have tried harder, thought bigger, been stronger.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to feel good enough when the world tells you that you never will be. Even the medication didn\u2019t help much. The constant taunting throughout the years had worn him down. Chipped away at his meager self-confidence until there was nothing left to help but a razor blade and a bottle of sleeping pills. That didn\u2019t work. And after he\u2019d gotten out of the hospital and gone through treatment and promised his parents he\u2019d continue going to therapy and taking his anti-depressants, he turned to the one thing he wasn\u2019t too weak to control. Food. Everyone else already thought he was small. Maybe if he made himself small enough, he could just disappear entirely. If nothing else, the smaller the target, the harder it is to hit.</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook and Taehyung were like his fortress walls. Taehyung already dealt with his alcoholic father so fighting off a few bullies at school was nothing to him, and the stress of being in foster care had driven Jungkook to the school\u2019s weight room and onto the field so just his appearance was intimidating enough to keep others away. \u00a0There were still the whispers though. They\u2019d seep into Jimin\u2019s head, constantly reminding him that if anyone ever found the chink in his armor, he was done for. Living in constant fear was exhausting.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s parents had gone to the principal about it but he said nothing could be done if it wasn\u2019t happening on school grounds. And of course, bullies are smart. They\u2019d taunt him in the halls and then wait in the shadows to pounce. They\u2019d only gotten to him once before, a day that Taehyung was in the hospital with a broken arm and Jungkook had to stay after for detention, and after that, his parents started picking him up. They\u2019d talked of homeschooling him but couldn\u2019t make it work. But Jimin assured them, as long as he had Taehyung and Jungkook, he\u2019d be okay.</p><p>And so the three of them were a unit. You rarely saw one without the other two. They\u2019d worked it out with the principal for at least one of them to be in every class with him. It had been that way since middle school. Now here they were their senior year. It was nearing the end of November now with no incidences so far. Only seven more months to graduation. \u00a0Jimin could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to the guidance counselor about your dad?\u201d Jimin asked Taehyung as they sat together in the cafeteria. The taller boy had come to school that morning sporting a new blackening bruise on his cheekbone.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head and stuffed a piece of broccoli into his mouth. \u201cYou saw what the principal did about your situation. You think a teacher is going to be able to do anything about mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could always come home with you one day,\u201d Jungkook said as he sat down in front of his tray. \u201cThe two of us could give him a taste of his own medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Taehyung uttered. \u201cIt\u2019s better not to provoke him. He doesn\u2019t get like this very often. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Jimin and Jungkook exchanged knowing glances. \u201cNot very often\u201d had turned into Taehyung sporting a new cut or bruise every week. It was getting worse and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay at my house tonight,\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head and pushed a pea around his tray with the tines of his fork. \u201cNo, Mina is going to be home tonight and it\u2019s best if I\u2019m there too. You know, to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jungkook cut him off.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s younger sister spent most nights at her friends\u2019 houses, luckily she was popular and had a lot of friends to be able to do this with. But on those nights where she was home, Taehyung always made sure to be there, just in case their dad decided to drink. Jimin remembered Taehyung staying at his house one night back in middle school and the next day at school seeing Mina with a black eye. His friend swore to never leave her home alone again after that and he\u2019d kept that promise.</p><p>\u201cBetter eat your vegetables so you can grow big and strong.\u201d Jimin looked up to see Jiho and a few of his friends sitting at the table across the aisle. The guy hadn\u2019t gone one day without tormenting him since sixth grade.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think midgets can grow big and strong,\u201d his friend, Kijung, retorted from beside him.</p><p>The rest of the table laughed while Jiho stared directly into Jimin\u2019s eyes, a vicious smirk on his lips.</p><p>Jimin quickly looked away again, a shudder running down his spine. \u201cDid either of you finish your calculus homework from last night?\u201d he asked as he grabbed his backpack off the bench next to him and began digging into it.</p><p>Jungkook and Taehyung ripped their eyes away from the other table and locked on each other, forks hovering just outside their mouths. Of course they didn\u2019t do it. With a roll of his own eyes, Jimin pulled out his text book and opened it to the assigned pages. He\u2019d been using his homework as a bookmark and now laid it on the table for the two to see. He ran a hand through his newly dyed orange hair as Jungkook and Taehyung fumbled with their own backpacks and searched for their notebooks so they could copy down his work.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would you do without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably fail math,\u201d Jungkook uttered and pulled the smaller boy\u2019s homework closer to him so he could hastily scribble down the answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the brains, you got the brawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I get?\u201d Taehyung asked looking up with his mouth full of rice.</p><p>Jimin looked down at his barely touched tray of food, over to Jungkook\u2019s somewhat normal sized lunch and then to Taehyung\u2019s tray piled high with everything on the line. He smiled fondly. \u201cThe appetite,\u201d he finally said before picking up a piece of melon and nibbling off a corner.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to stay over tonight?\u201d Jungkook asked Taehyung as the three of them made their way out of the school.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll call you if anything changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I used up my minutes for this month and Fake Dad refuses to buy me more.\u201d He always referred to his foster family as his fake family. Fake Mom, Fake Dad, Fake Brother 1, Fake Brother 2\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m hanging out with Yoongi-hyung though after this so just call him if you need to reach me.\u201d Then he brought up a hand to shield his eyes from the sun. \u201cJimin-ah, isn\u2019t your mom picking you up today?\u201d Jungkook asked, his eyes scanning the row of cars that were idling on the curb.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s own head moved along before his gaze settled on a dull, yellow hatchback. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Thursday,\u201d he said and lifted an arm to wave at the driver. \u201cHobi-hyung and I have group therapy.\u201d</p><p>An arm stuck up from the opposite side, hanging out the driver\u2019s side window and Jimin hitched his backpack higher on his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow,\u201d he said to his friends before jogging over to Hoseok\u2019s car and slipping into the passenger seat. Then with a horrible grinding sound of metal on metal and a shudder, the car pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, hyung?\u201d Jimin asked as he positioned his backpack on the floor between his feet.</p><p>\u201cJust fine, kid,\u201d Hoseok replied gripping the wheel with white knuckles.</p><p>It had been a few months now since Beach Day when the other six had witnessed him dump his pills into the bonfire, but even now he looked like he was feeling the lingering effects of withdrawal. Dark circles stained the skin under his eyes and his complexion looked pallid. Not at all the usual golden color. The boy who was normally a perfect depiction of sunshine, had become overcast. He looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping at night?\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>Hoseok glanced at himself in his rearview mirror and immediately straightened up. As if he could hide what Jimin had already picked up on. \u201cA bit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Obviously the boy didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Jimin had told him he\u2019d be there to help in any way that he could but how could he if Hoseok refused to let him?</p><p>The two had been friends for five years but really bonded in the hospital while Jimin was recovering from his suicide attempt and Hoseok was going through his latest bout of rehab. They\u2019d connected immediately, both lost souls having been seeking comfort in the wrong things. Going to group therapy together and encouraging each other in their battles with their demons had brought them closer together. And then when they both had finished inpatient treatment, they stayed close. Sure, Jimin had Jungkook and Taehyung but he\u2019d always have a special connection with Hoseok. He was the older brother Jimin had always needed. It was hard seeing his hyung struggling so much. He hated when any of his friends were hurting. None of them deserved it.</p><p>With his lip caught between his teeth, he pulled his phone out of the side pocket of his backpack, opening a text conversation with Yoongi.</p><p><b>Party at ur place tmrrw? Hobi needs us</b></p><p><b>Yoongi: Sounds good. Spread the word</b></p><p><b>thnks hyung</b></p><p><b>Yoongi: Np</b></p><p>*</p><p>After group therapy, Hoseok brought Jimin back to his house, pulling up to the curb and putting it in park. The two sat in silence for several seconds as the engine idled, Jimin chewing on the inside of his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIs it true, hyung?\u201d he finally asked quietly. \u201cIs the pain really back?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok drummed this thumbs against the steering wheel, his eyes glued to the dash. His pale lips pressed into a thin line and he gave a sharp nod. He looked ragged. More so than Jimin had seen him in a long time. Or maybe he just hadn\u2019t noticed. Hadn\u2019t noticed the stress lines creasing his young face. Or the way his mouth turned down. Or how his shoulders slumped forward as if his struggles were literally crushing him under their weight. Jimin felt the guilt like a fist grab his stomach and twist hard.</p><p>When they\u2019d first met, Hoseok was an incredible dancer. The guys had all gone to a couple of his shows and even as a high schooler, his moves had been impressive. Jimin always loved the idea of dancing but felt it would just be another thing to add to the long list of things he was bullied for. The last thing Jiho needed was more material.</p><p>And then, one night during rehearsal, Hoseok had tripped backward off the stage, falling several feet to the auditorium floor and landing on his neck. He\u2019d suffered a pretty bad spinal injury and the doctors weren\u2019t even sure if he\u2019d ever be able to walk again. Luckily, he regained his ability over the course of a few weeks, but the pain lingered in his neck and spine. He began to rely on pills to help but he kept taking them even after the pain finally subsided. The guys had gotten used to him being high. In fact, if he wasn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t Hoseok. He was a zombie, a shell, lifeless and hollow. But with the pills, he was full of energy, down for anything. Fun.</p><p>After throwing the pills in the fire during Beach Day, he\u2019d gone through the initial withdrawal period. Every time Jimin saw him, he looked like death, but as time went on, he began to resemble the Hoseok they knew before all of this. The one that could be happy and hyper without the high. But maybe it had been an act. An exhausting act, but one nonetheless. And now the pain was back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go back to the pills again, are you, hyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be disappointed in me?\u201d Hoseok asked, finally looking over at him. The sadness in his eyes said it all. He\u2019d been fighting hard, suffering in silence for several months and now he looked ready to give it all up.</p><p>Jimin lifted his hand and put it over the older boy\u2019s where they rested on the steering wheel. His fists were clenched so tight, they felt like steel under Jimin\u2019s own soft palm.</p><p>\u201cI would never be disappointed in you, hyung,\u201d he replied, keeping his voice steady and strong so Hoseok knew he meant every word. \u201cYou could completely relapse and I\u2019d never be disappointed in you. Recovery is hard. Addiction is hard. We have bad days and we have worse days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days are unbearable,\u201d Hoseok whispered. \u201cI know our therapist says to take it a day at a time but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget what the therapist said,\u201d Jimin interrupted. \u201cIf taking it a day at a time is too much, then take it an hour at a time. Or a minute or a second. As long as you make an effort, you\u2019re winning, hyung. And we\u2019re all rooting for you. I\u2019m rooting for you.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s grip on the steering wheel loosened under Jimin\u2019s hand and the boy looked at him. A spark flashed through his tired eyes. Something like determination. A newfound desire to keep going. \u201cThanks, Jimin,\u201d he uttered and gave him a weak smile before looking away and sniffing hard.</p><p>Jimin gave the older boy\u2019s hands a quick squeeze before pulling his own back and snatching his phone up out of his lap. His fingers danced across the screen as he typed.</p><p><b>party tonite?</b></p><p><b>\u2026</b></p><p><b>JK: alredy here</b></p><p><b>T: Mina\u2019s gone. i\u2019m down</b></p><p><b>NJ: see u then</b></p><p><b>Y: </b>\ud83d\udc4d</p><p><b>J: Leaving now.</b></p><p>Hoseok glanced down at his phone where it rested in the cupholder, the screen lit up with the group message. Jimin\u2019s breath hitched when he saw the corners of the boy\u2019s mouth twitch upward then he watched as Hoseok shifted the car back out of park and glanced over his shoulder to check for other cars.</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2019s?\u201d he asked.</p><p>With a smile, Jimin unlocked his phone again so he could let his mom know he would be home later. She sent back a thumbs up and a heart as they turned at the end of the street and headed toward Yoongi\u2019s place.</p><p>*</p><p>The second oldest of the group lived in a cluster of train cars in a yard near the river. He\u2019d made a sort of deal with the owner a while back that he\u2019d help maintain the place in exchange for somewhere to live. As long as he didn\u2019t bring shady people around or do anything illegal, the owner didn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>This was where the seven friends congregated. It was their home away from home\u2014for some even more home than their own. A place any of the six could go and they would never be turned away.</p><p>The night descended into chaos much like it regularly did. It always started out tame enough. A few of the guys\u2014usually the youngest three\u2014would crowd around the small tv that sat on Yoongi\u2019s coffee table, playing old Atari games, while a few of the others would just talk in the kitchen area, hunched over a pizza box. The older four being of legal drinking (and purchasing) age each usually supplied some type of alcohol and would experiment with mixing them. It would pretty much go downhill from there.</p><p>This night was no different. At one point, Jimin was jumping up and down on the couch with Taehyung, the two screaming the lyrics to the techno-y song filling the room when he was smashed in the chest with a pillow. Feathers exploded into the air and he sprawled off the couch and onto the plywood floor, his fuzzy head swimming even faster as he looked around dazedly for the source of the assault. At last, his eyes focused on Hoseok\u2019s beaming face and he narrowed his own at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on, hyung,\u201d he growled before grabbing a cushion off the couch and swinging it up hard.</p><p>Suddenly, the rest of the boys joined, grabbing whatever stuffed object they could find and before long, the place looked like a plushie and feather factory had exploded. Cotton and feathers covered every surface and the boys were rolling in fits of howling laughter. Jimin felt higher than a kite even as he lay among the feathers and fluff, Hoseok laying on his arm.</p><p>But once the laughter died down, a heavy silence fell over the place and within minutes, most of the guys were passed out drunk where they\u2019d landed. Jimin, however, pulled his arm out from under Hoseok and sat up on his haunches. He swayed with sleep, fighting it hard. He needed to go home. The other boys were in situations where their absence probably wouldn\u2019t even be noticed. Even Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2014out on dates most nights ever since her divorce from his father\u2014probably wasn\u2019t wondering where he was. But Jimin\u2019s parents were different. With his past and his problems and the bullying, they had come to worry a lot more easily about him. They always trusted he was safe when he was with the guys but if they expected him home, he had better come home.</p><p>He could have texted. He could have called and his mom or dad would have come and picked him up, no questions asked. But instead, he decided he\u2019d rather not bother anyone and make the short trek home.</p><p>It was a stupid idea. It was stupid. It was stupid and he knew it in his gut but his head was too numb to realize just how stupid and so he wobbled to his feet, stood there for a second to regain his balance and then slipped out the door and into the frigid night, alone.</p><p>*</p><p>He would have been fine had he stayed on the sidewalk. Just kept walking and not stopping until he was safe inside his house. But as he walked past the minute mart two blocks from home, his head lifted and his eyes locked on a rack of chips through the window. He had eaten barely anything all day and they sounded so good and he found himself veering off the path and pushing his way through the glass door, inside.</p><p>He may have even been fine if he\u2019d just grabbed the chips, paid for them and left. Even if he\u2019d tripped on the welcome mat once he was inside, <i>or</i> fumbled with his wallet for a few seconds, <i>or</i> dropped a bill while he was trying to stuff his change back into it, he would have been okay. But the fact that he did all of those things instead of just one, meant that a car was pulling up to the curb just as he was exiting the store. Just a few seconds longer and he would have been hidden again by the shadows and the occupants of the car wouldn\u2019t have even glanced his way.</p><p>But instead, he stumbled out the door, the driver\u2019s eyes immediately catching the movement, and his lips twisted into a malicious grin as he set his sights on Jimin.</p><p>\u201cWhere you goin, midget?\u201d</p><p>Jimin\u2019s blood turned cold at the familiar voice and suddenly it was as if the alcohol vanished from his system. He turned slowly, his mind no longer sluggish, but racing. And when he saw that three others were climbing out of the car along with Jiho, his stomach twisted and he felt bile rising in his throat.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Jiho,\u201d he cracked and swallowed hard.</p><p>The bigger boy laughed and folded his arms over his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t see your guard dogs anywhere,\u201d he said and made a point to look around. \u201cGetting a little brave, are we?\u201d</p><p>Jimin didn\u2019t waste another second to respond. Instead, he twisted around and took off running down the sidewalk. His heart pounded in time with his sprinting footsteps and staggered when the sound of his pursuers reached his ears. His breath became ragged in his throat and his body tingled with fear. He reached the end of the block and whipped around the corner, his shoes skidding on the sidewalk and he almost lost balance but regained it quickly, using his hands to push himself back up. There was an alley just a few yards ahead and beyond that, he could see his house. He was almost there. Relief flooded his body as his eyes locked on his front porch.</p><p>And then he felt a hand grab his hood and tug hard.</p><p>Jimin flew backward, a cry ripping from his throat as his body hit the pavement. And then more hands were on him, yanking him back up and shoving him into the dark alley.</p><p>*</p><p>Jimin finally found the strength to pick himself up almost twenty minutes after Jiho and his friends left him there in the alley. His whole body trembled and he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He didn\u2019t know if that was from the multiple kicks to the chest or if he was in the middle of a panic attack. Either way, he fought for air for what felt like an eternity before finally being able to breathe normally. After making his way slowly back to his house, he unlocked the door and nearly fell into the entryway when he twisted the knob while still leaning against it for support.</p><p>The house was quiet and dark and surely, his parents were in bed. He didn\u2019t want to wake them. He didn\u2019t want to spend any time assessing the damage done by Jiho and his lackeys. He just wanted to sleep. So, he crawled in pain up the stairs on his hands and knees, down the hallway and then climbed into bed with his torn clothes and shoes\u2014shoe? When did he lose the other one?\u2014praying he didn\u2019t die of internal bleeding or a concussion in the night.</p><p>*</p><p>When he woke the next morning, he stiffly shuffled into the bathroom to finally see how he looked. Awful. That\u2019s how. His bottom lip was swollen on one side, a deep cut slicing through it and down into his chin. There was blood crusted below his nose and several cuts and scrapes on his face. One eye was swollen practically shut, the skin around it a sickly green color. He had a big slice on one ear and bruises resembling fingerprints on his neck. His ribs ached and it hurt to breathe and when he lifted his shirt, he found his chest and stomach stained purple and black.</p><p>There was no way he could go to school like this. So he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He texted his mom from his room, telling her he felt extremely sick and couldn\u2019t get out of bed. She offered to stay home from work to take care of him but he insisted she leave. And his dad had left that morning for a week-long business trip. He was safe. Surely, over the weekend, most of the bruises and cuts would heal enough that they wouldn\u2019t be too noticeable come Monday. He\u2019d just have to avoid his mom. He texted Taehyung and Jungkook that he\u2019d gotten sick and would see them on Monday. He could put this whole thing behind him. Hopefully. He just needed to be more careful from now on.</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s nostrils flared, and the line of his jaw became prominent. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he snarled, his eyes roving over the students in the hallway as he searched for Jiho.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, no,\u201d Jimin said softly and he brought a hand up to rest on the trembling boy\u2019s arm.</p><p>Even though it was now Monday, the slice on his mouth hadn\u2019t healed as much as he\u2019d hoped. His eye was no longer swollen but was surrounded by a fading yellowish bruise. He looked better though. Good enough that he could hide it from his mom by wearing a hat and some makeup and keeping his head down.</p><p>At his touch, Jungkook immediately loosened, his face smoothing over again and he met Jimin\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy did you go back home alone after the party? Why didn\u2019t you wake me up? Or Tae? Or any of us? We would have gone with you.\u201d</p><p>Jimin raked his teeth over his bottom lip, wincing when he felt a sharp sting. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was stupid. I wasn\u2019t thinking. I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid, Jimin,\u201d Taehyung said quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say something like that.\u201d</p><p>Jimin nodded. He couldn\u2019t believe it though. He\u2019d done an incredibly idiotic thing going out alone like that. Of course, something bad would happen if he did something so careless. He deserved it. Of that, he was positive.</p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5387390292888c67ed81d701ce8f7f91/tumblr_inline_plrijyKlN81qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrovxqrpf1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>04. Run</b></h2><p><i>Life began to get to each of us.</i></p><p><b>January.</b></p><p>December came like a quick intake of breath and went like a heavy sigh. Once the cozy feeling of the holidays was over, winter became harsh and merciless. An icy fist that squeezed and squeezed until there was no warmth left. Taehyung was used to it though. He\u2019d never liked winter. Not since his mom had died just after Christmas his fifth year. Mina had been too young to remember her, being only three years old, but Taehyung could remember her perfectly still, as if he\u2019d talked to her just the day before.</p><p>He and his sister used to stay up late a lot\u2014at least whenever they were both home\u2014curled up on their shared bed, facing each other, covered in two layers of clothes and three blankets because their father turned the heat way down whenever he wasn\u2019t home, which was often. Not often enough though in Taehyung\u2019s opinion. But they would lay like that for hours and Taehyung would tell Mina stories about their mother. He didn\u2019t have many spectacular ones\u2014being he really could only remember a few from such a young age\u2014but once those ran out, she started asking him simpler things. What did mom look like? What did she smell like? What did she sound like? Feel like?</p><p>\u201cShe looked like spring, smelled like flowers, sounded like rain and felt like sunshine.\u201d How else could he describe her? Maybe his memories were clouded by the happier life he\u2019d lived with her in it but he\u2019d rather have this version of her in his mind. He needed it. Needed something good to cling to.</p><p>*</p><p>The first time his father had hit him, he\u2019d apologized profusely afterward, and made Taehyung promise he\u2019d never tell a soul. He didn\u2019t. And he didn\u2019t the second and third time either or any time after that. He\u2019d never told anyone, other than his friends and only because they grew suspicious of the bruises and the injuries and his unexpected late night calls asking if he could sleep over.</p><p>Over the years, he became good at reading the signs and predicting when his dad was going to have an outburst. If he got home from work and slammed the door behind him, it was time to retreat to the bedroom and bolt the door. If he came with a freshly bought bottle of alcohol, it was time to leave. Taehyung\u2019s only reason for not moving out was Mina. He\u2019d made a promise to her and himself that he\u2019d always be there to protect her, even if that meant taking the brunt of the abuse himself. Which it always did.</p><p>He\u2019d ended up in the hospital a few times keeping his dad away from his sister, stepping in the way of the punches, even tackling the man to the floor to give her a chance to run. It always ended badly but he never complained. Not when it would be so much worse for her. She didn\u2019t deserve to live in fear like this. He didn\u2019t either but especially not her. He at least had good memories of their mother. She only had the nightmares that came with having a monster for a father.</p><p>When things got too hard, his friends were his escape. Five of them had their own problems. And five of them had families that would get suspicious if he came around too often and he couldn\u2019t risk anyone going to the police and tearing him away from his sister. The one person he could always count on to help and be his safe place was Namjoon.</p><p>The boy was an orphan living secretly at the gas station where he worked. Taehyung didn\u2019t have to hide anything from him. In fact, there were countless times in the past where he\u2019d show up at the gas station pounding on the door at two in the morning, broken and bleeding and Namjoon wouldn\u2019t say anything. He would just let him inside and make room for him on the small twin blow-up mattress he dragged out of the broom closet every night. And if he was too worked up to sleep, the two would go out into the city and find something to do. This usually involved spray paint and a concrete wall. More than once the two found themselves running from police sirens, having been caught mid-tag. Namjoon wasn\u2019t the best influence but he was what Taehyung needed.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cTake this,\u201d the older boy said holding out a pint of ice cream to him.</p><p>Taehyung looked down at it. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like eating ice cream right now, hyung,\u201d he uttered and swiped his tongue across the fresh cut on his lower lip. The taste of salt and iron grated against his tastebuds. His whole head hurt from the evening\u2019s beating. He was ninety percent sure he had a concussion.</p><p>\u201cFor your lip,\u201d Namjoon replied dropping it into his hand.</p><p>Taehyung winced when he touched the cold container to his wound but immediately started to feel the pain fade as his lip began to go numb.</p><p>\u201cSo, I overslept this morning,\u201d Namjoon said as he grabbed a lollipop from the rack on the counter beside where Taehyung sat and unwrapped it.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mr. Bang-nim found me this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything about all this?\u201d Taehyung asked gesturing toward the mattress on the linoleum floor.</p><p>\u201cHe said if he finds me sleeping here again, I\u2019m fired.\u201d Then he stuck the candy in his mouth and twirled the stick between his fingers.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s stomach dropped when he saw the unease written across his hyung\u2019s face. The boy had nowhere to go. Taehyung would have invited Namjoon to stay with him but of course he\u2019d never want to subject one of his friends to the hell he had to deal with every day. Though it didn\u2019t matter either way. Namjoon didn\u2019t like asking for help. He wanted to be the one his friends came to, not the other way around. The boy was independent and stubborn to a fault.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to be more careful,\u201d Namjoon said with a shrug. Of course he was only acting like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Taehyung knew better.</p><p>Light flooded the dim store as a vehicle pulled into the parking lot and Taehyung felt his heart skip at the idea they were going to be caught. But when he looked out through the storefront window, relief flooded his chest. Jin\u2019s 4x4 truck sat idling in front of the gas pumps.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted him a bit ago,\u201d Namjoon interrupted, a gentle smile lifting his mouth and causing his cheeks to dimple.</p><p>Taehyung hopped off the counter and set the pint of ice cream down before making his way outside. Jin rolled the driver\u2019s side window down, music pouring from inside the cab. The other boys\u2019 voices rose above the singer\u2019s vocals as they screamed along to the song.</p><p>\u201cLong time no see,\u201d Taehyung said slapping the oldest boy\u2019s hand when he stuck it out the window.</p><p>Jin smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a week, Tae,\u201d he said.</p><p>Taehyung shrugged. \u201cA week is an eternity in this town.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Jin\u2019s face faltered for a second and Taehyung noticed his eyes trail down to the younger\u2019s wounded lip. He quickly swiped his tongue across it to catch the remaining blood. \u201cHow\u2019s Mina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cAt a sleepover.\u201d</p><p>The oldest boy\u2019s eyes lingered on his for several moments before he finally gave a small nod. \u201cHop in,\u201d he said and motioned with his head toward the back of the truck.</p><p>Taehyung scrambled over the side and dropped into the bed beside Jimin, who sat with his back against the cab, happily cramming chips into his mouth from a bag. \u201cWant some?\u201d he asked as he offered the bag to him.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Taehyung said and barely got settled beside his friend when the truck lurched forward and they pulled back out of the gas station.</p><p>It was pretty late and almost every food place was closed save for the all-night diner they frequented. There was nothing quality or good about the food there but it was cheap, and greasy and filled their bellies. The waitresses had come to grow fond of them over the years, knowing each of them by name and favorite flavor of milkshake.</p><p>The seven of them were the only ones there, which was a good thing since they tended to get a bit rowdy. Their plates had just barely been delivered when Yoongi decided he was going to try and cheer Taehyung up by throwing a handful of french fries at Jungkook. A food fight quickly broke out between the two and the poor waitress had to dodge away to keep from getting hit by a rogue fry.</p><p>They spent hours there, stuffing their faces and drowning their problems in ketchup and grease until finally, none of them could bring themselves to take one more bite. Then they made their way sleepily back to the truck, Taehyung flopping into the bed again, this time with Namjoon, and letting his head fall onto the older boy\u2019s lap. The gentle rock of the truck as it made its way down the road and the streetlights that passed intermittently overhead made his eyelids droop dangerously low. He probably shouldn\u2019t fall asleep if he really did have a concussion, but the sound of the engine, the warmth of Namjoon\u2019s thigh pressed against his cheek and the comfortable weight of food in his belly made it impossible for him to keep his eyes open and soon he drifted off completely.</p><p>*</p><p>Taehyung woke to the strong smell of coffee wafting into his nostrils and he opened his eyes to a chipped ceramic mug inches from his face. Jimin smiled warmly from the other side. It took Taehyung a few seconds to figure out where he was and why his body was aching so bad until he shifted and realized he\u2019d slept all night in Yoongi\u2019s bathtub.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like coffee,\u201d he uttered, batting his friend\u2019s hand away.</p><p>\u201cIt woke you up, though, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Jimin asked. His voice was much too cheerful for this time of morning. What time was it anyway?</p><p>Taehyung raked his hand through his greasy hair. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost noon. You should eat something, Tae,\u201d Jimin said and offered his hand to help the boy climb out of the tub.</p><p>Panic rushed through him like ice water. \u201cNoon?\u201d he asked. \u201cI need to get home. I need to be there when Mina gets back from her sleepover.\u201d He tripped out of the bathroom and through the living room, past the other boys crowded around a table as Jin tried to build a house with a deck of cards.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up!\u201d Jungkook exclaimed throwing his arms up.</p><p>\u201cJK!\u201d Jin yelled, his hands frozen in midair. \u201cStop with the sudden movements!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d Taehyung said as he rushed past. The gust of wind he created caused Jin\u2019s card house to collapse and he let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>Taehyung didn\u2019t stop though. As soon as he was out of Yoongi\u2019s home, he broke into a run and kept running until he burst through the front door of his apartment. His eyes scanned the empty front room. Liquor and beer bottles littered the kitchen counters, junk mail piled high on the table and scattered on the floor around it. The place was a dump but that wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary. The quiet, however, was. He barely took a step when a whimper cut through the silence and then suddenly he was running again. He paused in the hallway, eyes on the shadows moving in the room at the end. The door was barely cracked open so he couldn\u2019t see who was in there. But then he heard a choked cry. Mina.</p><p>Taehyung flew back out of the hall and wrapped a fist around the first thing he could grab, a beer bottle, then charged back down the hall, bursting into the bedroom just as his father\u2019s hand connected with his sister\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her!\u201d Taehyung roared shoving him back hard.</p><p>His dad stumbled back more in surprise than pain and he stared at the boy with wild, glazed over eyes. The man reeked of alcohol even at this early hour of the day. He bared his teeth and looked like he was about to lunge. But Taehyung didn\u2019t give him the chance. He rushed forward instead, swinging the beer bottle back and sending it crashing down on his dad\u2019s skull. The man staggered again, this time stunned by the blow. The bottle had broken when it came in contact with his head.</p><p>Taehyung could have stopped there. He could have grabbed his sister and turned and ran, maybe taken her back to Yoongi\u2019s. The other boys would be able to help them. But no, the sight of his dad striking her had caused the time bomb within him to finally detonate and now he knew nothing but rage. With a scream that sounded too far away to be coming from his own lungs, Taehyung surged forward again, jabbing the broken bottle into the soft flesh of his father\u2019s stomach. He felt it lodge deep in the man\u2019s belly and a sickening groan fell from his father\u2019s lips but it did nothing to keep Taehyung from stabbing him again and again until blood soaked the front of the man\u2019s t-shirt and coated his own hands and clothes.</p><p>In the chaos, he couldn\u2019t hear anything but his own gasping breath and the cries that continued to tumble from the man in front of him until his dad finally collapsed to the floor. Then his sister\u2019s screams reached his ears, her voice already going hoarse from yelling for so long. With a violent shudder, Taehyung staggered back, letting the broken and bloodied bottle fall from his hand and clatter to the floor. His mouth fell open in a silent scream and his knees gave out. As he fell to the floor, his sister caught him, sobbing into his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Taehyung uttered. \u201cWhat have I done, Mina? What have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved me, Tae,\u201d she cried into his neck. \u201cYou saved us.\u201d</p><p>Their father lay motionless in front of them, the red spreading across his shirt until you could no longer tell what color it had been originally. It seeped down into the carpet, a dark stain that would never fully go away.</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave, Mina,\u201d Taehyung said, his voice shaking so hard it came out as barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tae,\u201d she cracked. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to.\u201d He grabbed her hard by the shoulders and pulled her down in front of him. His eyes drilled into hers. She had their mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou have to get somewhere safe. I can\u2019t come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur dad is dead!\u201d Taehyung screamed. \u201cOur dad is dead and I killed him!\u201d</p><p>A whimper fell from Mina\u2019s mouth and for the first time, Taehyung noticed the bruises welling up under he skin. There were so many. How long had their dad been hitting her before he\u2019d gotten there?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mina,\u201d he said more gently. \u201cPlease, go to a friend\u2019s house. Tell them dad isn\u2019t here and neither am I and you don\u2019t know where either of us are. Please. I\u2019ll come for you when it\u2019s safe. But until then, you have to go.\u201d</p><p>Mina nodded, her head jerking up and down erratically as she tried and failed to keep whatever last bit of composure she had. Then suddenly, she fell against him, a wail tearing from her throat and he clutched her to his chest, tears streaming down his own cheeks. His hands were coated still in his father\u2019s blood and he raked his fingers through his sister\u2019s hair, holding onto her, pulling her closer, smelling her, feeling her against him. Who knew if he\u2019d ever see her again?</p><p>Mina changed her clothes and washed the blood out of her hair from when Taehyung had held her, before rushing out of the apartment. He didn\u2019t go outside but watched her from the front window. She\u2019d texted a friend and asked them to pick her up and now he watched as she got into their car, her head lifting, her eyes locking on his one last time before she climbed into the the backseat and then she was gone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do. That moment of clarity when he\u2019d needed to get his sister away was gone and now all he could do was stare at the messy living room in shock. With his back pressed against the door, he sank down onto the carpet, his hands catching him as he fell. His hands. Covered in sticky, drying blood. His father\u2019s blood. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>A murderer.</p><p>His head began to pound as the thoughts swirled in his brain. It was all too much. Everything was too much. The coppery smell of blood filled his nose, filled his head, filled the room and it overwhelmed him. His hands shook and his breath hitched and he couldn\u2019t inhale deep enough. Too much. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>His eyes watered and his nerves were shot and he was numb but could feel everything at the same time and it was overwhelming. His skin crawled and his heart hammered and his lungs were on fire and he couldn\u2019t breathe and he squeezed his eyes shut as if he could shut out the world and it was all too much. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>A murderer.</p><p>*</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, it was dark. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d fallen asleep or passed out but when his gaze fell on the digital clock on the microwave, he saw that he\u2019d been out for nearly nine hours.</p><p>It was silent in the apartment. Silent as the dead. His head slumped to the side and he looked at the entrance to the hallway. His father was back there. Or rather, his body. If he crawled just six feet to his left, he\u2019d be able to peer down the hall and see his dad\u2019s body slumped against the wall in the back bedroom. Immediately, Taehyung felt like he was going to be sick. He made his way clumsily to his feet and tripped into the kitchen, barely making it to the sink before he heaved and the contents of his stomach emptied into the basin. He spit a few times before sitting up again, a sheen of sweat coating his skin. When he brought his arm up to wipe his forehead, his eyes locked on the brown, dried blood that crusted on his skin. Then he looked down again at his white t-shirt. Well, it used to be white.</p><p>He rushed out of the kitchen, turning his head away as he passed the hall so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally catch a glimpse of what was at the other end, then slipped out the front door, locking it behind him. He zipped his jacket up to his chin, glad that at least the dark sweatshirt hid the stains, and pulled the hood up over his hair and his sleeves down over his hands. He kept his head down to conceal any blood spatters on his face as he made his way through the dark streets and to the gas station.</p><p>To his relief, there were no cars there, but then another thought occurred to him. What if Namjoon wasn\u2019t there either? What if he\u2019d been caught again by his boss? He had to be there. Taehyung didn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to.</p><p>He jogged up to the front door and peered in. The place was dark. It looked deserted. As the panic started to set in, he raised his fist and beat it against the glass. At last, he caught movement from within. And then Namjoon appeared in one of the aisles toward the back. He seemed to recognize who it was immediately and hurried over. A lollipop stick stuck out of his mouth and he switched it from one corner to the other in a nervous habit as he unlocked the door and opened it. Only then did he notice that Taehyung was covered in blood. Slowly, he lifted a hand and pulled the candy out of his mouth.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s breath quivered as he met the older boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI did something really bad, hyung.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c22cc05dfed25979cd8bccaa2fb299e/tumblr_inline_plrim8qsxI1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrox5bo8Z1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>05. Whalien 52</b></h2><p><i>Finding the minuscule fissures in the surface and digging its fingers in until we began to splinter.</i></p><p><b>February.<br/></b></p><p>An annoying ringing shattered the silence within the dark gas station causing Kim Namjoon to stir. With a groan, he started to roll over on his mattress when his body hit something. He froze in his half-sleep before remembering he wasn\u2019t alone on his bed. An arm flew out and draped over his shoulder, hand hovering in front of his face.</p><p>\u201cTae,\u201d he uttered and reached over to turn the alarm off on his phone.</p><p>Taehyung didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cTae,\u201d Namjoon said again a little louder. This time the boy let out a sleepy groan which tapered off into a snore. With a sigh, Namjoon got up off the mattress, his joints cracking as he did so and he winced rubbing his stiff neck. \u201cTae, you have to get up. You can\u2019t be here when Mr. Bang-nim shows up.\u201d</p><p>It was still dark outside but Namjoon had learned never to let himself sleep until sunrise again. The gas station he worked at was a weird one that actually closed at night unlike the majority of the other stations in town. He was the opening and closing shift Monday through Friday and his boss took the middle shift, but the man came early in the morning to drop off the day\u2019s till and Namjoon couldn\u2019t be caught sleeping there again. One more time and he\u2019d be fired and back on the street.<br/></p><p>*</p><p>He\u2019d been by himself for much of his life. His parents had left him with his grandmother one weekend saying they were going on a special vacation for their anniversary. Only, they never came back. Namjoon\u2019s grandmother was an old, frail woman. Much too frail to take on a child\u2014he was barely five at the time\u2014and he spent most of his childhood fending for himself. When he was twelve, she developed cancer and passed away within just a few weeks of receiving the news. As soon as she died, Namjoon ran. He was so afraid of being put into foster care, never having a real home, never having a real family. He\u2019d basically already been fending for himself for seven years before that.</p><p>There\u2019d never been any record of his parents abandoning him or him living with his grandmother so it wasn\u2019t hard for him to disappear without a trace. The boy was clever and intelligent for his age and he was able to make it into the city and fake his way into school. He didn\u2019t care much for the classes, but going to school meant getting breakfast and lunch for free. It was there that he met Hoseok. The two became friends quickly, both having an interest in music. Hoseok was a dancer and Namjoon loved writing songs and melodies. Hoseok was already close with Yoongi who at this point was just discovering his love for producing. Together, the three of them would spend hours after school at Hoseok\u2019s house\u2014since Namjoon didn\u2019t have one and Yoongi\u2019s parents didn\u2019t approve of his newfound hobby\u2014writing music together that Yoongi would then go home and produce on his computer. Nothing ever came of it but for Namjoon, this was a pivotal time in his life. He developed a friendship with a small group that grew bigger until there were seven of them, the others like the family he never had. Brothers he was so desperate for. And for this friendship, he\u2019d be eternally grateful.</p><p>Eventually, they all figured out his situation, though he tried to hide it as he didn\u2019t want to be a burden on any of them. They found ways to help him out though, whether it was Jimin inviting him over for dinner once a week or Yoongi asking him to stay the night\u2014or several nights\u2014to help him work on a new song. The boys helped him as much as he would let them.</p><p>Taehyung, though, helped him the most, probably without even realizing it. The first time Taehyung called asking if he could stay with him\u2014at that time he had been working and sleeping at the gas station for a few months\u2014Namjoon was hesitant to let him. He\u2019d needed a job so he could afford food and a cellphone and already felt guilty having to secretly sleep at the station but he had nowhere else to go, and he worked the opening and closing shift anyway, so what was even the point of leaving at night? But then when Taehyung showed up at the gas station with a broken nose and a bruise on his throat that resembled a handprint, Namjoon couldn\u2019t turn him away.</p><p>Sure, the other boys were amazing. Always willing to help him, always wanting to do whatever they could, but it made him feel reliant on them and the last thing he wanted was to not be able to take care of himself. But Taehyung wasn\u2019t like that. Taehyung made him feel needed for once.</p><p>*</p><p>When he\u2019d shown up in the middle of the night covered in blood a month before, Namjoon hadn\u2019t wasted any time pulling him into the bathroom and helping clean him up as much as he could. He used the small travel size shampoos and soaps the gas station carried and scrubbed at Taehyung\u2019s hair and skin until the water in the sink ran clear. He had him change into the only other set of clothes he had, taking the bloody ones, dousing them with bleach and lighter fluid and then bagging them up and tossing them into the dumpster in the alley.</p><p>Then together, the two of them went back to Taehyung\u2019s apartment. Namjoon and Taehyung\u2014silent in his still shocked state\u2014dragged the body of Taehyung\u2019s father into the bathroom and dumped him into the tub. After that, Namjoon put Taehyung to work in the kitchen, having him bag up all the liquor bottles and the mail on the floor while he took care of the back bedroom. He scrubbed at the carpet with bleach until there was no trace of blood left.</p><p>He\u2019d grabbed several bags of ice and two rolls of duct tape from the gas station and now he emptied the bags into the tub before taping the window shut. Then, he shut and locked the door and sealed the cracks. With his eyes and nose now burning with the smell of bleach, Namjoon finally made his way back into the living room, only to find Taehyung standing there in the middle of it completely still.</p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his name, the boy had looked up to meet Namjoon\u2019s eyes. Taehyung\u2019s face was shining with tears as they trailed down his cheeks but you\u2019d never know he was crying by his stone-like expression.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even feel bad for doing it, hyung,\u201d he\u2019d uttered and when Namjoon looked down at his hands, they were clenched into trembling fists. \u201cI was just so angry. I couldn\u2019t stop. What\u2019s wrong with me, hyung? Why don\u2019t I feel guilty for killing my father?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon had dropped the bag full of bloody paper towels and bleach right there next to the hallway and rushed over to Taehyung just in time to catch him before he could collapse to the floor. The boy sobbed into his chest, clinging so tightly to him that his fingers bruised his skin. Namjoon held him for a long time there in the middle of the living room, not saying a word and not loosening his tight grip on him. Finally, Taehyung\u2019s sobs quieted to sporadic sniffles and then he let go of Namjoon, sitting back on his butt and dragging his hands down his face to wipe his tears away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Taehyung had asked, his voice raspy and low.</p><p>Namjoon looked around at the several trash bags filled with evidence of their being there. His attempt to conceal the body wasn\u2019t going to hold up forever. Eventually, it was going to start to smell and someone was going to discover it. Not to mention the man had a job. His absence wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed for long.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you far away from here,\u201d Namjoon finally said and Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened in fear.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t send me away, hyung,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this on my own.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Namjoon got to his feet and held a hand out to him. \u201cThen we need to figure out a way for you to hide.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Taehyung had been staying with him ever since then. Every morning before the sun came up, he would leave and every night after closing, he\u2019d return. Namjoon wasn\u2019t sure what he did during the day and would spend the whole time worrying the boy wasn\u2019t going to show up in the evening, but so far, he always did.</p><p>\u201cTae, come on, man,\u201d Namjoon said again, giving the boy a hard push and sending him rolling off the other side of the mattress with a groan of protest. \u201cUnless you want to hide in a broom closet all day, you have to get out of here.\u201d Taehyung finally stirred, getting slowly to his feet.</p><p>He rubbed at his eyes, staggered and caught himself on a rack of magazines before he could topple over. \u201cDon\u2019t make me leave today, hyung,\u201d he whined. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out there and I don\u2019t have anything to do. Just let me stay here today, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get caught?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung slowly peeled one eye open to look up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll stay hidden. I promise. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Just then, headlights flashed across their faces and Namjoon\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cGet in the bathroom,\u201d he said quickly before shoving him into the tiny space. Then he picked up the air mattress and threw it in after him. Luckily, the thing was light. After looking around to make sure there was no evidence of him being there, Namjoon ran into the backroom, unlocking the door that lead to the alley and slipping outside.He stood there behind the store for several minutes, waiting for his heart to stop hammering and the sweat that had broken out on his skin to dry. It was cold outside. A cold so sharp it stung his lungs with each breath and made his head hurt.</p><p>At last, he stuffed his numb hands into his pockets and, as nonchalantly as possible, walked around to the front of the store to meet his boss.</p><p>Mr. Bang was just getting out of his SUV when Namjoon came around the corner. The sky had lightened to a pale gray already.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Namjoon,\u201d the man said with a friendly smile and made his way toward the locked front doors.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sir,\u201d Namjoon replied. He watched with coiled nerves as his boss withdrew a key and unlocked the store. Then when he followed him inside, Namjoon\u2019s eyes shifted to the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few boxes in the back that need unpacked if you want to do that while I open the register,\u201d Mr. Bang said as he slipped behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cAlready done, sir,\u201d Namjoon replied shifting nervously from one foot to the other.</p><p>A sharp knock came from the direction of the bathroom just then causing Namjoon to jump. Immediately, he felt his face go pale. Maybe Mr. Bang hadn\u2019t heard. But when he looked back at his boss and saw that the man was looking curiously now at the bathroom, a sense of dread overcame him.</p><p>\u201cWe better not have a rat problem again,\u201d the man uttered to himself as he, to Namjoon\u2019s horror, got out from behind the counter again and made his way toward the bathroom at the back of the store.</p><p>Namjoon watched as everything seemed to move in slow motion. His eyes could only focus on the man\u2019s hand as he reached for the doorknob, and silently begin to pray that by some miracle, Taehyung would somehow be able to squeeze his long, lanky body into a dark corner and disappear.</p><p>No such luck. The door creaked open, revealing an unsuspecting Taehyung, blanket wrapped around him as he sat on the cold tile floor.</p><p>Namjoon let out a groan and squeezed his eyes shut. Maybe his boss would keep it a secret. Maybe he\u2019d understand the situation and let them stay. No, he knew better than that.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Taehyung said quietly, his mouth lifting into a guilty smile.</p><p>Namjoon\u2019s eyes drilled into the back of his boss\u2019s head as he waited with bated breath for the man to speak. The silence was thick, making it hard for Namjoon to pull air into his lungs. Then at last, the owner of the gas station turned to look at him. The expression on his face was unreadable at first. Completely blank like a mannequin\u2019s. Surely, the man recognized Taehyung from the news. The boy\u2019s picture and his father\u2019s had been on every network since the discovery of the man\u2019s body in their apartment. The police had already questioned the other boys, none of them giving any sort of answer more than a shrug and an \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him,\u201d and Namjoon hadn\u2019t even been questioned since there wasn\u2019t any record of him existing in the city anyway.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, come outside with me,\u201d Mr. Bang finally said, his voice steady, his face still unreadable.</p><p>With a quick glance back at Taehyung, Namjoon followed after him through the back room and out the exit into the alley.</p><p>Mr. Bang finally turned to face him, raking his hands down his face with a heavy sigh. \u201cNamjoon, I\u2019ve turned a blind eye a lot over the three years you\u2019ve worked for me. I paid you under the table. Didn\u2019t say anything when stock didn\u2019t match with my inventory list. \u00a0Didn\u2019t say anything when I found out you were sleeping here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Mr. Bang interrupted. \u201cAnd I hoped it was only temporary. But Namjoon, you\u2019re harboring a fugitive. I can\u2019t have that in my store. I could lose the business. I could go to jail. I\u2019m sorry but the two of you are going to have to go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon squeezed his eyes shut. He just had to think for a moment. There had to be some way for him to be able to keep his job. He wet his lips. \u201cMr. Bang\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t call the police. But you can\u2019t work here anymore. I\u2019m sorry, Namjoon. I really am.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, the boy opened his eyes again, finally meeting his boss\u2019s\u2014well, former boss\u2019s. The man had been like a father to him for the past three years. A good boss. Which had made Namjoon work hard to be a good employee. He\u2019d only taken items when he was really desperate. Though, lately he\u2019d been a lot more careless. Taking candy and food and alcohol. Even if he wasn\u2019t hiding Taehyung, he deserved to be fired. Finally, Namjoon took another deep breath. \u201cI understand, sir,\u201d he said and extended his hand. \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s mouth lifted into a sad smile as he reached out and shook Namjoon\u2019s hand. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do for you. If you need money, or a lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thank you, sir,\u201d Namjoon cut him off. \u201cI can take care of this on my own.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bang gave him a sharp nod. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a few minutes to collect your things.\u201d Then he turned and went back into his store.</p><p>Namjoon stood there in the alley for several more minutes, eyes on the ground as he kicked at the gravel with his shoe. What was he going to do now? He was homeless again. Homeless and harboring a fugitive. Taehyung wouldn\u2019t last long on the streets. Namjoon had been taking care of himself for a long time. He knew what parts of town to avoid. He knew how to evade. Where to go if he needed temporary shelter. How to survive on as little food as possible. But Taehyung\u2026he was only a boy. While his life hadn\u2019t been a luxurious one, or even an okay one, at least he\u2019d had a roof over his head. Clothes on his back. Food in his stomach. He needed that again.</p><p>Finally, Namjoon went back inside. Taehyung was leaning against the bathroom doorframe, his hands stuffed deep into his pockets, his bottom lip between his teeth. He straightened up when he saw his hyung come from the back room.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Namjoon said walking past him to the broom closet.</p><p>Taehyung followed after him. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon opened the closet and grabbed his worn, black backpack then started stuffing his few belongings into it. Beanie, face mask, phone charger, copy of Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, a journal and a pen.</p><p>\u201cHyung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d Namjoon replied and pulled the confused boy after him.</p><p>Mr. Bang stood by the door, a shopping bag in one hand and an envelope in the other. He held them out to Namjoon as they approached. \u201cTake these.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked down at the bag. He could see several cups of ramen, water bottles and a few other things through the opaque plastic.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help, sir,\u201d he said and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Taehyung look at him.</p><p>\u201cHyung, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my responsibility,\u201d Namjoon interrupted. \u201cI can take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least take your last paycheck.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon glanced down at the thick envelope then up at his former boss as he took it from him. When he opened the envelope, his eyes widened. \u201cSir, I can\u2019t accept this. It\u2019s so much more than my normal pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust consider it severance.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Namjoon stuffed the envelope into the pocket of his coat and looked again at the man. \u201cThank you for giving me the opportunity to work for you, sir. And for letting me stay here for as long as you did.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bang gave him a tight-lipped nod before stepping out of the way so he could pull Taehyung out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now, hyung?\u201d Taehyung asked as the two made their way back into the alley behind the gas station.</p><p>\u201cFor now, we find somewhere to hide until it\u2019s dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon yanked him down between two dumpsters just as a car pulled into the alley a block down. The two sat there in tense silence until it passed by them. Then Namjoon peaked his head out, not letting Taehyung get back up until the car had turned out of the alley and onto the street.</p><p>\u201cHyung?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the boy who looked back with saddened eyes. He seemed so much younger, so much smaller all of a sudden. He was only a couple years Namjoon\u2019s junior but the uneasy expression on his face made him look like a scared child. Namjoon opened his backpack and pulled out his beanie and face mask.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tae,\u201d Namjoon said handing the things to him. After Taehyung put them on, Namjoon pulled him against him and they made their way farther down the alley. \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>Throughout the day, Namjoon racked his brain, trying to come up with a solution to this rather large problem of theirs. He couldn\u2019t ask any of the guys. Yoongi could lose his home if he was caught with Taehyung, and the others lived with their families. But maybe Jin\u2026</p><p>*</p><p>The oldest boy in the group was home for an extended weekend and was the one to answer the door when Namjoon knocked. He\u2019d had Taehyung hide in the shadows created by the neatly trimmed hedge along the side of the house just in case one of Jin\u2019s parents answered instead.</p><p>\u201cJoon?\u201d Jin said stepping out onto the porch. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been busy,\u201d Namjoon replied and looked down at his feet. He hated being here. He hated what he was about to do. Hated asking for help. Because it just made him feel like he wasn\u2019t capable. Like he was worthless.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here so late?\u201d Jin asked, pulling him out of his dark thoughts. \u201cIs something going on? Are the others alright?\u201d Suddenly his eyes widened in horror. \u201cIs it Taehyung?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon bit his lip and gave a pathetic chuckle. \u201cYeah, I guess you could say that,\u201d he said then heard a rustle behind him as Taehyung stepped into the light.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jin-hyung.\u201d</p><p>Jin\u2019s eyes darted to the side to meet the younger boy\u2019s over Namjoon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cTae?\u201d Then he looked at Namjoon again. \u201cHas he been with you this whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s been staying with me at the gas station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the two of you haven\u2019t been caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were today,\u201d Taehyung answered, his words muffled by the face mask he was still wearing, and stuffed his hands into the pockets of the coat Namjoon had given him a month ago.</p><p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t be here,\u201d Jin said and took a step back so he was back on the other side of the threshold. \u201cI already had to lie to the police and to my parents\u2026and if anyone sees us talking\u2014\u201d</p><p>Namjoon let out a heavy sigh and looked up at Jin. \u201cTae has nowhere to go, hyung. He needs you right now.\u201d</p><p>Jin shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he cracked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joon, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Anger flooded Namjoon\u2019s gut as he bit the inside of his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be his friend,\u201d Namjoon uttered so Taehyung couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cAny of the other guys wouldn\u2019t even hesitate to help. You know I wouldn\u2019t normally ask for a favor but I\u2019m desperate. Please don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>Jin lifted his eyes to the ceiling, blinking hard and letting his head fall back. \u201cJoon, I don\u2019t think you understand what you\u2019re asking of me, here.\u201d Then he looked at him again. \u201cWhere would I hide him? How would I keep this from my parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother, hyung\u201d Namjoon growled. \u201cYou would <i>figure</i> it out because that\u2019s what family <i>does</i>.\u201d</p><p>Jin stepped back further, hand reaching up to grip the doorknob. He looked like he was ready to turn and run. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys,\u201d he said again shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to ask. I\u2019m sorry. Really. I wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p><p><i>There is something you can do</i>, Namjoon thought as he ground his teeth together. But he just stared back at the boy. He could see the despair written across Jin\u2019s face. Maybe he really was trapped. Maybe he really couldn\u2019t help no matter how much he wanted to. At last, Namjoon\u2019s face smoothed then with a heavy sigh, he turned around. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Tae.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gave a curt nod then looked back up at Jin where he stood in his doorway. \u201cBye, Jin-hyung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tae,\u201d he cracked.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon didn\u2019t turn around again to say goodbye. His chest felt so tight, he didn\u2019t even know if he could speak. So instead, he kept walking down the path, Taehyung\u2019s footsteps echoing behind him. Then he heard the faint sound of the door closing and the tightness dissipated, leaving him feeling emptier than he ever had before.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go now, hyung?\u201d Taehyung asked from behind him.</p><p>It was so cold now and Namjoon had no idea what to tell the younger boy. They couldn\u2019t stay out in the open like this. Someone would eventually recognize Taehyung. No, he needed to get out of the city. Far away. He needed to disappear.</p><p>Namjoon lifted his head, looked farther down the street, his eyes settling on the empty bus stop. Immediately he felt a lump forming in his stomach. He knew what he had to do.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said taking Taehyung\u2019s arm in his hand and pulling him down the sidewalk. When they reached the bus stop, he had the younger boy sit on the bench as he studied the schedule attached to a pole. A bus would be arriving any minute. Just their luck.</p><p>\u201cAre we going somewhere?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t.\u201d Then he sucked in a sharp breath and turned to face the boy. \u201cBut you are.\u201d Then Namjoon tugged his beanie down further over Taehyung\u2019s ears and lifted the mask around his neck up to cover the lower half of his face. In the bulky sweater and coat he wore, his lanky, teenage body was well hidden making it hard to tell how old he was.</p><p>\u201cWait until you\u2019re at least a few towns over before you get off,\u201d Namjoon said, trying his hardest not to meet the scared boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen you need to find some sort of shelter. If you can stay there, do it. If not, try to stay in populated parts of town. You\u2019ll be safer that way. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, hyung,\u201d Taehyung said, his eyes turned down in the corners and silently pleading with Namjoon not to make him go.</p><p>Namjoon felt his heart shatter in his chest. He\u2019d told Taehyung he\u2019d keep him safe and he\u2019d failed. With a sharp intake of breath to clear the fog from his eyes, he shoved his hand into the pocket of his coat and withdrew the envelope of money he\u2019d received from Mr. Bang.</p><p>\u201cTake this,\u201d he said to Taehyung and pressed it into his hand, not even giving him a chance to reach out and take it himself.</p><p>\u201cBut, hyung, this is all your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Namjoon said with a shake of his head. \u201cYou need it more than I do. Please, just take it and find some place safe to hide.\u201d At last he met the boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cJust find somewhere to stay put and once everything calms down, I\u2019ll come and find you. We\u2019ll figure something out together, okay?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded and then the two turned when the bus came around the corner. Suddenly, Namjoon felt unease like a chunk of ice settle in his gut. Maybe this was a mistake. His thoughts were interrupted though when Taehyung threw his arms around the older boy and clutched onto him for dear life.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you, hyung.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon pulled his bottom lip into his mouth and bit down hard to keep the tears from spilling over. In a moment of weakness, he buried his head into the younger boy\u2019s neck, and inhaled deeply. In all honesty, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do without Taehyung either.</p><p>Namjoon was the one to finally pull away. With a hard sniff, he stepped back, letting one hand linger on the boy\u2019s shoulder for just a moment longer, giving it a fond squeeze before dropping his arm entirely. The bus had already been sitting for a little while behind them, the driver waiting for the two to finish saying their goodbyes.</p><p>\u201cCall me any time day or night if you need anything,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t need anything, just call sometimes so I know you\u2019re alright.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded quickly, his breath trembling in the cold. Or maybe it was something else. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon,\u201d he said, his voice low and quivering just a bit.</p><p>Namjoon nodded back then motioned with his chin toward the bus. He watched Taehyung step on, stopping at the top of the stairs to pay for his fare before heading back to find a seat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever see Taehyung again. And as the bus pulled away, he hoped and prayed to whatever was out there that he would, but something told him this was a permanent goodbye.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4df17cf204417156d0ae1b5d07da07a8/tumblr_inline_plriogg9ll1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plroyyll771qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>06. House of Cards</b></h2><p><i>It wasn\u2019t long before we\u2019d break apart, shatter like a glass vase on the tile floor.</i><br/></p><p><b>March.</b><br/></p><p>Min Yoongi let out a heavy sigh, leaning way back in his computer chair until his spine gave a satisfying crack. He\u2019d been sitting hunched forward at his desk for hours now and this song he\u2019d been working on for the past two weeks was just starting to finally take shape. His stomach growled and he glanced up at the corner of his monitor to see that three hours had passed since the last time he checked. Which meant he hadn\u2019t eaten anything in almost six.</p><p><i>Just a little bit longer,</i> he thought and rolled his shoulders before leaning back in.</p><p>The sound of a groan and the crunch of couch springs came from the room next to him and Yoongi pushed back in his chair again to peer through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cKook-ah,\u201d he cracked, his voice raspy from not being used in so long. \u201cAre you getting up?\u201d</p><p>The maknae groaned again but sat up, his eyes still shut and his bottom lip jutting forward in a sleepy pout.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get going soon so you aren\u2019t late for school.\u201d</p><p>Another groan. \u201cBut it\u2019s Friday. Can\u2019t I just skip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\u2019s been gone for almost a month now. You want Jimin to be alone?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was silent for a few seconds as he mulled over Yoongi\u2019s words. \u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d he said then with a huff, got to his feet.</p><p>A satisfied smile tugged at the corner of Yoongi\u2019s mouth as he sat up and rolled back over to his desk, the wheels of his chair catching and scraping against the plywood floor.</p><p>His place was nothing special. Sheet rocked walls, plywood floors and no windows. He wouldn\u2019t even call it a house. He\u2019d barely call it livable. But it was home.</p><p>Each of the guys\u2014besides Jin\u2014had lived there at one time or another with him and Jungkook basically lived there all the time. Yoongi didn\u2019t mind. He\u2019d grown very fond of the boy. In fact, he saw a lot of himself in him. The kid was driven. He had so much potential. But life had dealt him a cruel hand. Luckily for him, Yoongi had been through something similar.</p><p>*</p><p>His parents had been the type to have his life mapped out for him from birth. They knew where he was to go to school, what college, what classes, what major, what profession he was supposed to end up with. He was their golden child and he tried to live up to their impossibly high standards for as long as he could. But music never factored in for them and when he discovered his love for it in middle school, his priorities changed. No longer did he have time for all of his AP classes or clubs or sports. It was music, music, music.</p><p>At sixteen, he dropped out and his parents\u2014disgusted at their disgrace of a son\u2014wanted nothing to do with him. Quickly, their golden child became less valuable than tarnished brass and they dumped him out on the street.</p><p>That was almost four years ago. The boy still spent most nights working on songs, writing, producing, marketing to try and get his foot in the door of the music industry but nothing had really happened. He wasn\u2019t one to give up though.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHyung, have you slept at all?\u201d Jungkook asked peaking his head into the doorway of Yoongi\u2019s studio.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes stayed glued to his monitor. \u201cI slept yesterday,\u201d he uttered suddenly feeling a rush of fatigue. He blinked hard.</p><p>\u201cHave you at least eaten recently?\u201d Jungkook took the older boy\u2019s silence as a no and leaned in to place a bowl with an apple and a boiled egg on the edge of his desk. \u201cTry to get some rest today, hyung.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grunted in reply, missing the fond smile that curled the corners of Jungkook\u2019s mouth upward. A few seconds later, he heard the front door open. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your homework!\u201d he called out.</p><p>Jungkook let out an exasperated cry before Yoongi heard frantic rustling, then a \u201cbye, hyung!\u201d and finally, the heavy door of the train car dragging across the ground and slamming shut with a metal <i>clang</i>. Once the echo faded, Yoongi cracked his neck and then leaned in again to his computer. This project wasn\u2019t like any he\u2019d worked on in the past. This one could possibly be the most important of his life.</p><p>He\u2019d seen a job posting for a producing gig in Seoul; a position at a very well known label. One that had put out nothing but incredible music since it started. At first Yoongi had been hesitant to apply but then decided to give it a shot. What was the worse that could happen? They reject him?</p><p>Actually, yes. Rejection was the literal worst thing that could happen to Yoongi. Burn his house down. Steal all his money. Run him over with your car. But please. Please don\u2019t tell him that the thing he\u2019s worked so hard on, the thing that he\u2019s so passionate about, the thing that made his parents actually kick him out of his house, isn\u2019t good enough. Nothing scared him more than that.</p><p>Yoongi pushed back from his desk again. The symbolic weight of this project had taken its toll on him over the past few weeks, causing tight knots to form in his shoulders and migraines to drill into the space between his eyes until pain killers and alcohol couldn\u2019t even dull the ache. Maybe he really did need to get some rest. Ah, but he was so close. He could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just a few more hours. Another day maybe. Just a little bit longer and it would be finished. And then the painstakingly long wait for their reply.</p><p>With an anxiety filled sigh, he grabbed the apple from Jungkook out of the bowl and took a bite.</p><p>*</p><p>Just as he thought, the song took him another two days to complete. Two more sleep and food deprived, caffeine fueled days. By the time he submitted his song, he felt ready to sleep for the next three months. Instead, that night while he was tossing and turning in bed, his phone screen lit up with an email. He reached over for it, squinting at the bright screen in the darkness. His heavy eyes popped open when he saw the name of the sender and he sat bolt upright. His heart pounded as he clicked on the email. His hands shook and he dropped his phone, scrambling to pick it up so he could finally find out if his effort had been for nothing. Then he opened the email with bated breath and his eyes roved over the first line of the email.</p><p><i>Mr. Min,</i></p><p><i>We were impressed with your song and\u2026</i></p><p>Yoongi read the whole email several times before letting the meaning of the words completely sink in. He\u2019d made it. He\u2019d made it? Yoongi got to his feet in one fluid motion.</p><p>\u201cI made it?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, he wanted to run into the living room where Jungkook was sleeping soundly and jump up and down on him, screaming until the maknae was celebrating with him. He wanted to call the others. He wanted to share the good news. But\u2026</p><p>What about Jungkook? What would the kid do if Yoongi up and moved to the big city? Of course he\u2019d want to come with him. To drop out of school, leave his foster family, leave the rest of the guys behind to follow him. No, Yoongi couldn\u2019t let him do that. His whole life was here. He needed to graduate. He needed to go to college. Make something of himself. Get out of this perpetual life of suck he was currently in. But could Yoongi leave him behind? Sure, Jungkook needed him, needed his couch, needed the security of having somewhere and someone that actually cared about him as a person instead of as a means to a paycheck from the government. But Yoongi kind of needed him too. It was nice having someone that cared about his well-being when that was usually the furthest thing from his own mind. Jungkook was always asking him if he\u2019d slept, if he\u2019d eaten, if he\u2019d showered, recently.</p><p>Jungkook was the one to keep him connected to the rest of the guys most of the time. He would have become a hermit by now if the kid wasn\u2019t constantly inviting them over to hang out. It wasn\u2019t that Yoongi didn\u2019t like having them over. It wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t value their friendship. He could just so easily get so wrapped up in a project that he\u2019d be glued to his computer for weeks. Jungkook kept him grounded. Kept him in this world instead of in his head all the time.</p><p>But this was Yoongi\u2019s dream. This was the validation he\u2019d been denied by his parents. The validation he needed. But the question was, what did he need more?</p><p>*</p><p>Yoongi slumped on the farthest cushion on the couch from Jungkook, empty glass in his hand. He\u2019d been sitting there for a while, rolling the last bit of his bitter drink around in the bottom of the glass and trying to figure out how he could possibly break the news to Jungkook that he\u2019d be leaving for Seoul the next day.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told anyone about the job offer, or rather the prospective job offer. There hadn\u2019t actually been a contract signed but Yoongi had a very good feeling that there\u2019d be one waiting for him once he got there. He\u2019d been in contact with the label since that first fateful email a week before. They\u2019d sent him several files to tweak and send back. Just more tests of his producing capabilities. They seemed impressed.</p><p>*</p><p>This party was in celebration of Taehyung coming back to them\u2014not that they ever needed a reason to get together. He\u2019d ended up getting picked up by the police a week before a few cities over and when he tried calling Namjoon, he got an automated message saying the boy\u2019s service had been disconnected. Much to Namjoon\u2019s dismay and the other guys insistence, he\u2019d had been couch surfing for the past month while he looked for a job. Since he hadn\u2019t been able to find one, he couldn\u2019t pay his bill and his phone was disconnected.</p><p>Luckily, Taehyung\u2019s next phone call had been to Jin, who had managed to persuade his lawyer father to bail the boy out and represent him in his upcoming trial. Of course, Jin had to threaten to drop out of college to get his parents to comply but they finally did much to his relief. He\u2019d felt sick with guilt for weeks after having to turn Namjoon and Taehyung away that night they showed up at his door. He\u2019d wanted nothing more than to invite them both in and promise the younger boys that everything was going to be okay. But what could have happened if they were caught under his roof? What would have become of his father\u2019s reputation? Of his schooling? \u00a0Even now with Taehyung in his care and out of jail, he couldn\u2019t get rid of the guilt that still hung over his head. And now he stood in Yoongi\u2019s kitchen, slumped against the counter, nursing his own drink.</p><p>Namjoon was having his own pity party in a different corner. The boy had confided in Yoongi a lot over the past month. Yoongi had never seen him so worked up and simultaneously so low before. His self-appointed purpose in life for so long had been as the support for his friends. As a guardian for Taehyung. And now he\u2019d failed him. Namjoon had become even more of a wreck after waking up to find his phone had been disconnected and that Taehyung had tried calling him from jail.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there when he needed me the most, hyung,\u201d he\u2019d said to Yoongi one night, tears slipping down his cheeks. \u201cWhat kind of friend am I?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Even with this being a party, no one seemed to be in a celebratory mood. While the three oldest brooded in their respective places, and Hoseok tried not to pass out from exhaustion on an arm chair, the three youngest clung to each other on the other side of the couch. The last couple of months had been traumatizing for Taehyung. From killing his father, to wandering around a strange city, to getting arrested and having to spend several nights in a jail cell not knowing his fate, it had all been too much.</p><p>When Jin and Jin\u2019s father had gone to pick him up from the police station, he\u2019d looked like a completely different person. His skin was pale and pulled taut over his bones, more prominent since he hadn\u2019t eaten much while on the run. He hadn\u2019t said a word to Jin and only uttered a \u201cthank you\u201d to Mr. Kim. His face had been completely blank and he could barely make eye contact with his oldest friend. The boy had seemed like nothing more than a shell of his former self. He warmed up a bit over the following weeks, opening up just barely, talking a little more, filling back out, and much to the others\u2019 relief, color began to return to his skin again. But that haunting look in his eyes was still there. Who knew if it would ever go away?</p><p>With one of his supports no longer by his side at school all day, Jimin had started to notice the menacing looks again from Jiho and his friends. After being ambushed a couple months back, his anxiety had been through the roof, his nerves on edge all day every day. It was exhausting. Especially keeping up a positive front for Jungkook. The poor kid was trying so hard to be there for Jimin but the original idea had been for either he <i>or</i> Taehyung to be in all of Jimin\u2019s classes which left the boy vulnerable at times. Jiho was smart. He\u2019d never touch Jimin in school but he could intimidate him which was almost worse. It made Jimin flinch at every little thing. Made him hesitate before turning corners. Made him shrink into Jungkook causing them to stumble over each other, get tangled up. Jungkook couldn\u2019t miss a single day, couldn\u2019t rest for a single moment if it meant Jimin being without his protection.</p><p>The three of them looked exhausted. Looked defeated there slumped on the couch with controllers in their hands as they played some mindless video game on Yoongi\u2019s little tv. Yoongi could see just how affected they\u2019d each become by everything over the past couple of months. The bags under their eyes. The way they leaned into each other as if making sure they were really there. The way Jimin\u2019s leg constantly touched Taehyung\u2019s as if to say, \u201c<i>It&rsquo;s okay. Don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d </i>while his other shoulder touched Jungkook\u2019s as if to say, \u201c<i>please don\u2019t leave me.</i>\u201d</p><p>That was it. Yoongi had to break the news to Jungkook. He couldn\u2019t let him come with him. Jimin needed Jungkook. Hoseok needed Jimin. Taehyung needed Jin. Namjoon needed Taehyung. The group needed to stay together. At least the rest of them. They\u2019d be fine without Yoongi. They\u2019d find another place to hang out. Everything would be fine. But how to break the news to the youngest maknae? Yoongi looked down at his empty glass. Maybe a bit more liquid courage would help. He felt too conflicted right now. Too guilty still.</p><p>With a groan, he got up off the couch and he made his way to the kitchen. He was already feeling pretty out of it\u2014the fact that he hadn\u2019t slept well for over a week was definitely part of it. Seeing Jin there blocking the alcohol made anger flare up in the pit of his stomach. Sure the boy had eventually helped Taehyung by bailing him out of jail but the kid wouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place if Jin hadn\u2019t turned him away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing in front of the booze,\u201d Yoongi uttered. The only reason Jin was there was because he\u2019d brought Taehyung, and because\u2014despite the fact that Yoongi kind of hated him right now\u2014he was still part of the group.</p><p>Jin didn\u2019t say anything, instead just stepped to the side so Yoongi could grab the half empty bottle of whiskey. He didn\u2019t even bother pouring more into his cup, just brought the mouth of the bottle to his lips and tossed his head back. The alcohol burned its way down his throat, liquid fire pooling in his belly until he finally had to stop so he could take a breath. Then he lowered his head again, his unfocused eyes landing on Jin.</p><p>\u201cYou know what my problem is with you?\u201d he asked as he jabbed a finger into the older boy\u2019s face.</p><p>Completely taken off guard, Jin tried to step back but was already flush against the counter and cupboards. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap, <i>hyung</i>,\u201d Yoongi snarled. The energy of the whole room suddenly shifted as the others stopped what they were doing to watch. \u201cNamjoon told me everything,\u201d Yoongi continued. \u201cYou think you can just abandon your brother when he needs you the most and then just swoop in like some hero and save the day?\u201d Jin\u2019s eyes darted to the others in the room and he swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019re a real piece of work, you know that?\u201d Yoongi asked, leaning in close. \u201cYou\u2019re really just over here flaunting your silver spoon over all of our heads. Making everyone else feel like absolute crap while you\u2019re off getting some <i>fancy</i> degree. Living in your <i>fancy</i> dorms. Coming home to your <i>fancy</i> house. You know, some of us actually have to work hard to get where we want to go? Most of us have to work hard just to get by. And even then, we still fail.\u201d Yoongi let out a pathetic chuckle and wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his jacket. \u201cEverything just comes so easy for you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you even still hang out with us? Why would you want to be around losers like us all the time? Huh? Do you like just holding what we\u2019ll never have over our heads? Is that it? Does it make you feel better seeing how crappy our lives are, <i>Seokjin</i>?\u201d</p><p>A hand clamped down on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and pulled him away from Jin. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, hyung,\u201d Jungkook said in his ear.</p><p>Yoongi spun around to face him. Over the years they\u2019d known each other, Yoongi had watched Jungkook surpass him in height and stature. He was taller, broader, stronger. The boy was a fighter. A survivor. He\u2019d make it just fine without Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, get out,\u201d Yoongi said at last and took another swig from the bottle in his hand.</p><p>No one moved or said anything, none of them really sure what to do.</p><p>\u201cI said out!\u201d Yoongi\u2019s voice cracked on the last word as he raised his voice. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>The others leapt into action then. Jin slipped out from behind Yoongi and pulled his truck keys from his pocket as he made his way toward the door. At the sight of their ride leaving, Taehyung and Jimin dropped their controllers on the coffee table and hurried after him, uttering quick goodbyes to Jungkook as they passed him. Hoseok and Namjoon left silently as well, Namjoon\u2019s gaze holding Yoongi\u2019s as he made his way past him. Hoseok was too tired to even care about the outburst. He hadn\u2019t really wanted to be there anyway and now he was just looking forward to going home and sleeping. The two left, pulling the heavy metal door shut behind them and at last it was just Yoongi and Jungkook left in the silence.</p><p>Yoongi let out a heavy sigh as he placed the whiskey bottle back on the counter then pushed the heels of his hands against his eyes. His head was pounding and his throat burned and he just wanted to collapse into his bed. This whole night had been a complete wreck. He wanted nothing more than to just be alone so he could try and figure everything out. But when he opened his eyes again, he saw Jungkook still standing there with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Yoongi sighed again.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Kook,\u201d he said finally, raking his fingers back through his hair.</p><p>Jungkook furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The anguish that had been haunting him every night for the past week reawakened in Yoongi\u2019s gut and he clenched his fists down at his sides to keep his composure from cracking. \u201cI said, go home,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019m not your parent. I can\u2019t take care of you. You have a family. You have a home. Go there.\u201d</p><p>He wanted so badly to take Jungkook with him to Seoul. He wanted to protect the boy from the world. He wanted to be his home. To be his family. To be there. But he knew he couldn\u2019t and he could feel himself already starting to break apart. <i>It\u2019s what\u2019s best for him. You can\u2019t protect him. You have to let him go.</i></p><p>He wanted nothing more in this life than to not be the cause of the hurt expression on Jungkook\u2019s face. \u201cBut hyung\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get out!\u201d Yoongi screamed and squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cI don\u2019t want you anymore!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s breath hitched and suddenly he was silent. Yoongi didn\u2019t want to look at him. Didn\u2019t want to meet his eyes. But finally he did. And what he saw shattered him completely. The boy\u2019s eyes were glassy, his bottom lip pulled into his mouth. He wore the same dejected expression as the first time he\u2019d run away from home and ended up at Yoongi\u2019s. He\u2019d told him that he\u2019d gotten in a fight with his foster dad. That the man had called him worthless, nothing more than a means to a paycheck. That the minute he turned eighteen, he was out of there. Yoongi had pulled him in. Let him cry against him. Squeezed him tight and told him he\u2019d never feel unwanted again\u2026</p><p>Finally, Jungkook spoke. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi let out a stuttering breath. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d <i>Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. He\u2019ll be alright. He can make it on his own. </i>\u201cI\u2019ve had to give up a lot for you. I\u2019ve had to put my dreams on hold. My future on hold so you\u2019d have a place to stay and someone to take care of you. You\u2019ve been holding me back long enough. You\u2019re not a kid anymore. You need to start taking care of yourself. I\u2019ve done my job. Now you need to start doing yours.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook swallowed hard, eyes drilling so intensely into Yoongi\u2019s that at last the older boy had to look up at the ceiling. <i>Please, just leave. Please, just go and don\u2019t say anything.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just drunk, hyung,\u201d Jungkook finally said and stepped forward to place his hands on Yoongi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re just stressed out and you need to sleep it off.\u201d Then he started guiding Yoongi to his bedroom.</p><p>But Yoongi pushed him away. \u201cI don\u2019t <i>just need sleep</i>,\u201d he growled and turned to face the younger boy again. \u201cI said what I said and I meant it.\u201d Then he shoved Jungkook hard, causing him to stumble back toward the door. \u201cGo home, Jungkook.\u201d He shoved him again. \u201cGo home and don\u2019t come back here.\u201d Again. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here, anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop shoving me, hyung,\u201d Jungkook snapped and straightened up to his full height. The kid was massive compared to Yoongi and infinitely more intimidating. Yoongi swallowed hard but kept his expression the same. This was for the kid\u2019s own good.</p><p>\u201cThen grow up, Jungkook,\u201d he barked. \u201cStop being some weak little child. Stop depending on everyone else. Stop expecting everyone to take care of you and just man up.\u201d</p><p>This set something off in the boy. In one quick motion, Jungkook stepped forward and gripped the front of Yoongi\u2019s shirt in his fists. Fire burned in his eyes and Yoongi could feel the fear rushing through his veins like ice water.</p><p>\u201cYou want to hit me, Kook?\u201d he asked. \u201cThen hit me.\u201d</p><p>With a shake of his head, Jungkook let Yoongi go, dropping him back onto his feet, and he stumbled backward. A pathetic chuckle bubbled up from his throat and he shook his head. \u201cNot even man enough to do that.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Yoongi was wrenched forward again by his collar and he felt Jungkook\u2019s fist connect with his cheek. The force knocked him to the ground and he landed hard on his hands and knees. His mouth filled with the bitter taste of iron and when he brought his hand up to swipe at his lip, it came away streaked with blood.</p><p>\u201cI am a man,\u201d Jungkook said looking down at him. Then without another word, he went over, pushed the door open and glanced back one more time to lock eyes with the boy that had basically raised him. With that, he slipped out, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Yoongi exhaled heavily as he let his head fall back against the floor. His head was still spinning and his face stung and he could feel a trickle of blood dripping down from the corner of his mouth. He\u2019d never felt worse in his entire life. The hangover the next day was going to suck but not as much as the hole in his chest would after what he\u2019d just done. The look of betrayal on Jungkook\u2019s face would haunt him forever.</p><p>Already, feeling a bit soberer now, he could feel the guilt and regret flooding his chest making it harder to breathe. No. He couldn\u2019t do that to himself. This was for the best. He\u2019d already decided that when he took the job. He just wished things could have ended differently. Just wished he could come back once in a while to see everyone. Have them come visit him. But not anymore. Not after everything that happened that night.</p><p>With a groan, Yoongi rolled over and got to his feet. He was supposed to head out in the morning and he still had to pack everything up. All he wanted to do was sleep, but it looked like, once again, this was going to be another exhaustive night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/92db9f47e53bed0af0272d792c6cb531/tumblr_inline_plripwTCSN1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrozkJbhu1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>07. Save Me</b></h2><p><i>You can only pick up the pieces and paste them back together so many times before they no longer fit.</i><br/></p><p><b>April.</b><br/></p><p>One evening when Jungkook was ten, he and his parents were driving home from the grocery store. This was a weekly occurrence with them. One he always looked forward to because he and his dad would race each other down the aisles. This particular night, it was raining really hard. So hard that the wipers were working at a rapid pace to try and keep the windshield clear and the street visible. The sound, though a bit jarring, was repetitive enough to turn into a sort of rhythm. One that had Jungkook\u2019s eyelids growing heavy until he slumped against the door, face pressed against his palm, and he drifted to sleep.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, it wasn\u2019t to the sound of rain on the metal car roof or the double time beat of the windshield wipers. It was to the beeps of monitors and quiet conversations between strangers. It was too bright. Too white. Too sterile. It took him several seconds to realize he was lying in a bed in a hospital room. And his parents weren\u2019t in there with him.</p><p>The night they were all coming home from grocery shopping, a semi truck had run a red light and smashed into them. His dad had been killed instantly and his mom only lived for another week before dying in the hospital of complications. The crash had put Jungkook in a coma and by the time he came out of it, he didn\u2019t have parents. He\u2019d fallen asleep on the way home from the store and woken up in the hospital two weeks later, completely alone in the world.</p><p>For several months after the wreck, he\u2019d withdrawn into himself, and while he barely ever spoke a word to anyone during that time, the voice in his mind screamed at the heavens, demanding to know why he had lived. Why his family had been taken. Why he couldn\u2019t have gone with them. He\u2019d heard a nurse say back in the hospital that the only reason he survived was because, since he\u2019d been asleep, his body was limp, therefore absorbed most of the impact, unlike his parents who, as anyone else anticipating a collision would, tensed up. It\u2019s why drunk drivers so often walk away from a crash when their victim doesn\u2019t. If he would have been awake, maybe he\u2019d be wherever his parents were too. Maybe they could be together.</p><p>He\u2019d been in the foster system ever since then. Being moved from fake family to fake family, \u00a0temporary house to temporary house so quickly sometimes he didn\u2019t even get the chance to memorize his address. No one wanted a preteen. Once you were past the impressionable age, you were treated more as a guest in the house rather than part of the family. No one willingly took in older kids and teenagers because they wanted to. It was always for the money. At least, that was how Jungkook saw it.</p><p>He\u2019d learned that out of all of the kids he ever lived with, he was the expendable one. The one that didn\u2019t need attention. Didn\u2019t need love because he could take care of himself. Over time, he\u2019d learned to survive. To see his fake family as a provider of the bare necessities and nothing else. He\u2019d learned to never grow attached. To never let anyone in. To never even unpack his things because any day now, his case worker was going to knock on the door and tell him it was time to move on.</p><p>It\u2019s hard not to latch onto the bitterness and let it fester inside you. Especially when there\u2019s such a lack of love in your life. Jungkook shut down, made a bubble around himself of anger and hatred. He\u2019d get into it with his fake siblings, with his fake parents. With anyone that looked at him wrong. He got into sports and started working out as a way to avoid home and clear his mind. He got bigger, more intimidating. People started leaving him alone.</p><p>Then in seventh grade, he saw a small boy get cornered by a group of guys much bigger than him. He didn\u2019t even hesitate before getting right in the middle of it, blocking the boy with his body and staring them down until they backed off. That was the day he met Jimin. The day he figured out that his strength could in fact be put to good use. Jimin introduced him to Tae and it didn\u2019t take long for the two to break down his walls. To show him that there were in fact people in this world that cared about him. That he could care about too.</p><p>When he met the rest of the guys, he found himself feeling angry less often. Smiling more. Laughing even. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d laughed so much. They were his escape from the real world. The ones that kept him going. That kept him sane. He wanted to protect them with everything he had. Protect Jimin from the darkness that enshrouded him at school.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook slammed the front door to his house behind him and slung his backpack over his shoulder. His ears burned under the hood of his sweatshirt and hot tears glazed his eyes, threatening to spill over the moment he blinked. It seemed like more and more this was the way he\u2019d leave. With a shouting match between he and his fake dad and then a slam of the door.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s mom\u2019s car idled on the curb, Jimin sitting in the passenger seat, his eyes following Jungkook as he trudged toward them.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin\u2019s mom said when Jungkook slid into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he uttered and sniffed hard to keep the tears from spilling over. When his eyes were finally dry, he looked up, catching Jimin staring in the rear view mirror. The older boy\u2019s forehead was creased, the corners of his eyes dipped low with concern. Jungkook turned his head, tearing his gaze from his friend\u2019s and watched the houses rush by through the window. Then he felt his phone buzz in his pocket and he pulled it out.</p><p><b>Jimin: fake dad?</b></p><p>Jungkook glanced up again to see that Jimin\u2019s eyes were still trained on him through the mirror. With a sigh, he looked back down at his screen, his fingers typing out an answer.</p><p><b>JK: yea. im fine tho.</b></p><p><b>Jimin: ok</b></p><p>It was obvious Jimin didn\u2019t believe him but Jungkook was an impenetrable fortress that chose when to let people in and when to keep them locked out. He didn\u2019t like talking about his home life, especially to Jimin. The boy had enough to worry about with school and Jiho and therapy. The last thing he needed was to be triggered by Jungkook and his miserable situation. Jimin had always been an empathetic soul, though. And maybe that was why Jungkook had been drawn to him from the start. Jungkook was comfortable around him. He felt understood even though Jimin knew very little. The only other person in the group he\u2019d opened up to was Yoongi.</p><p>Yoongi.</p><p>The older boy had been like a big brother to him. Like a father. A protector. A home. His words still resonated in Jungkook\u2019s head, bouncing around in his skull like a ricocheting bullet. <i>I don\u2019t want you anymore.</i> He never thought he\u2019d hear that from Yoongi. His fake dad had drilled it into him that he wasn\u2019t actually wanted. That they only took in a fourteen year old with a temper because they knew he\u2019d be easier to manage than their younger wards. And money was money. As long as they kept him fed and clothed, they would receive a check every month. He expected that from them. But not Yoongi. Never Yoongi.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t believed he\u2019d heard his hyung right at first. That, for some reason, his ears had interpreted what the boy had said incorrectly. That maybe his mind had been playing tricks on him. But then the words hit him like a sledgehammer to the chest, bruising his ribcage and crushing his lungs. They\u2019d left him breathless.</p><p><i>You don\u2019t want me anymore?</i> He\u2019d had to be sure. Yoongi couldn\u2019t have said it. Couldn\u2019t have meant to say something that he knew would cause so much damage to the younger boy. That would leave him feeling so broken. So worthless. <i>You heard me.</i> And he had. And he heard him for weeks after that. Those words. Those words that pierced him to the core. That extinguished his spirit and left him groping around in darkness.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want you anymore.</i></p><p>Leaving Yoongi\u2019s house that night, he\u2019d wandered the streets for a while, his anger and hurt slowly fading to numbness. And now he only ever felt one of the two. When he was angry he wanted to punch something or someone and when he was numb, he wanted to feel pain. Just needed to feel something.</p><p>He lashed out even more at his foster parents. At the other kids in the house. At his teachers and students at school. He got in a lot of fights. Provoked classmates and rough looking strangers on the streets. He was lucky no one ever pulled a knife or a gun on him. Though maybe he secretly hoped someone would.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay at my house tonight?\u201d Jimin asked once they\u2019d gotten to school and his mom\u2019s car had pulled away from the curb. \u201cFriday night\u2019s pizza night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t turn down pizza night,\u201d Jungkook replied, the corner of his mouth twitching up into a small smirk. Just the prospect of not having to go back to his fake family after school was enough to lighten his mood a bit. Just a bit, though. Yoongi\u2019s words still dragged him down into the icy depths of a dark ocean, but the thought of staying at Jimin\u2019s house at least gave him a chance to break the surface and take in a breath before being pulled back down again.</p><p>School had never really been a problem for Jungkook. He\u2019d always stayed pretty much in the middle academically. Never getting straight A\u2019s but never getting below a C. It kept his fake parents and the teachers off his back which was all that mattered to him. Though now with Taehyung no longer at school as he awaited his trial, Jungkook was having to rush from his classes that he didn\u2019t share with Jimin to meet the boy, sometimes forgetting to turn in his homework or stopping by his locker to grab his books for his next class. He was starting to fall a bit behind and his grades were reflecting it.</p><p>Jiho had left them pretty much alone for a while now. Sure, Jungkook saw him in the halls and sometimes would catch him just looking at Jimin but it seemed like making Jimin miserable was no longer on his agenda. Maybe he\u2019d finally gotten bored of tormenting him. Though Jungkook wasn\u2019t stupid enough to let his guard down, even for a second.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot Tae\u2019s homework,\u201d Jimin said as he walked quickly down the hall toward his locker. He\u2019d been bringing work to Taehyung so the boy would still be able to graduate on time. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t grab it before class. I guess I was just in such a rush. It was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Jiminie,\u201d Jungkook said. He almost had to jog to keep up. The boy was so much smaller than him, how was he covering so much ground so quickly?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been stressed out ever since Tae got arrested and all that crap and now you\u2019re having to work twice as hard and I just\u2014\u201d he stopped in front of his locker, hand hovering over the combination dial. He squeezed his eyes shut with a sigh then looked up at Jungkook. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so weak, Jungkook-ah.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sucked in a breath, words of assurance at the back of his throat when he heard a locker slam a bit further down the hall. He and Jimin turned to find Jiho, by himself, coming toward them. Where were his friends?</p><p>\u201cSo the rumors are true, then,\u201d Jiho said, his dark eyes sparkling as he leaned against the locker next to Jungkook. \u201cYour other guard dog got sent to the pound.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was in Jiho\u2019s face in a second, teeth bared. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Tae like that,\u201d he growled.</p><p>The bully\u2019s eyes widened in fear for just a second before narrowing to slits, a devilish grin pulling his mouth upward. \u201cOr what?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch me. Not here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d Jungkook asked, stepping forward again, forcing Jiho to back up against the locker.</p><p>Jiho let out a dark chuckle. \u201cYou want to hit me so bad right now, don\u2019t you, Pitt-bull?\u201d</p><p>He had no idea.</p><p>Jungkook could feel the muscle in his arm tightening and contracting with each clench of his fist. He wanted so badly to slam his knuckles against Jiho\u2019s skull. Make him think twice before ever even looking Jimin\u2019s way again. He was so sick of seeing the fear, the exhaustion, the misery in Jimin\u2019s eyes every day when he\u2019d come to school. Even though graduation was less than two months away, it still wasn\u2019t close enough. Jungkook didn\u2019t know if Jimin was going to make it. He already looked skinnier than he had even just a month ago. Much longer and he\u2019d wither away to nothing. Disappear completely. All because of this worthless piece of trash grinning up at Jungkook. He\u2019d been feeling so cold, so empty since Yoongi had abandoned him. But now fire built in his gut. Flames licked up his chest. Burned his throat and set his eyes ablaze. If there was one thing he knew how to do, it was protect his friends. And this worm was still threatening one of them.</p><p>He\u2019d had enough.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jungkook,\u201d Jiho uttered so only he could hear. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any teachers around. Hit me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook felt a cold hand on his arm, fingers curling around his bicep. \u201cJungkook-ah.\u201d Jimin\u2019s small voice was barely audible over the sound of Jungkook\u2019s heart crashing in his ears. \u201cCome on. He\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook turned his head to look at his friend. At his tired face. At his pallid skin. His hollowed cheeks. The boy looked like he hadn\u2019t felt happiness in years, yet somehow he still managed to greet him every morning with a smile. How was this boy still alive?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Jimin,\u201d Jungkook said and glanced back at Jiho. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it.\u201d Then he turned to meet his friend\u2019s eyes again. \u201cBut you are.\u201d</p><p>Before Jimin could stop him, Jungkook reared back and threw his fist forward. It connected with a sickening crack against Jiho\u2019s cheekbone, sending the boy crashing to the ground on his hands and knees. A thick stream of bloody saliva dripped from his mouth and he spit onto the linoleum floor before looking back up to meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes. His face split in a wide, red stained grin.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, what did you do?\u201d Jimin whispered from behind him.</p><p>When he turned to look at him, Jungkook\u2019s eyes caught on someone over his shoulder. Principal Song approached with two of Jiho\u2019s friends trailing behind him.</p><p>He\u2019d been set up. Of course Jiho and his friends had planned this. Anything to get Jimin\u2019s second guard dog in trouble and out of the picture.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is going on here?\u201d Principal Song asked, his face red with anger.</p><p>Jiho\u2019s friends rushed forward to help the injured boy up and he stumbled a bit, playing up that he was really hurt. And he probably was. Jungkook had hit him pretty hard.</p><p>\u201cHe just hit me, Principal Song-nim,\u201d Jiho said weakly. \u201cJust straight up punched me in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even pretend you didn\u2019t provoke him, Jiho,\u201d Jimin snapped from behind Jungkook then looked at the principal. \u201cHe was just defending me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Principal Song barked.</p><p>Jungkook hadn\u2019t said a word or moved a muscle since first seeing the man coming toward him. The fire in his gut raged on, leaving his shoulders heaving and his heart pounding. His eyes drilled into the man as his fists clenched tighter. He could feel where the skin on one of his knuckles had split when it came in contact with Jiho\u2019s face.</p><p>Jiho. He wanted to make the boy suffer as much as he\u2019d made Jimin suffer since middle school. He wanted to make him wish he\u2019d never said a word to Jimin. Never laid hands on him. Jungkook wanted to kill him.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit this student?\u201d the principal asked gesturing toward the cowering Jiho.</p><p>Finally, Jungkook pulled in a steady breath to speak. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he told me to.\u201d</p><p>Principal Song opened his mouth but nothing came out. He obviously hadn\u2019t expected to hear that answer and now he flapped his mouth a few more times like a fish, his eyes darting back and forth between the injured boy and the one that had injured him. At last, he gathered his thoughts. \u201cWe have a strict no violence policy here. You were all made well aware of that at the beginning of the year. Did you forget?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook clenched his jaw. \u201cNo,\u201d he said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cSo what made you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been harassing Jimin since sixth grade.\u201d Jungkook said coldly. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>Again, the principal was stricken speechless. It took him just a few seconds to regain his composure. \u201cYou not liking the way we do things does not justify taking matters into your own hands.\u201d Then Principal Song turned to Jiho and his friends. \u201cPlease escort Jiho to the nurse and then all of you get to class.\u201d He waited as they made their way down the hall and disappeared around the corner. Then he turned to Jungkook. \u201cYou know the rules, young man. You\u2019ll need to come with me. Back to class, Jimin.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook watched a look of horror pass over Jimin\u2019s face as the principal took Jungkook by the shoulder and led him away. He craned his neck around, keeping his eyes locked on Jimin\u2019s until they turned the corner. Dread filled his own stomach. If he was suspended, how would he be able to protect Jimin? He turned his head to look back at the principal.</p><p>\u201cPrincipal Song-Nim, you can\u2019t suspend me. Jimin can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe staff will do whatever we can to keep our students safe,\u201d the man replied sternly. \u201cHe will be fine without you.\u201d</p><p>That was it. Jungkook ripped his shoulder out of the principal\u2019s hand and turned to face him. The boy was eye level with the man but more muscular and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a flash of cruel satisfaction when Principal Song took a slight step backward.</p><p>\u201cThis school has done nothing to make Jimin feel safe,\u201d Jungkook growled. \u201cSomething is going to happen to him while I\u2019m gone. Just watch. And when it does, I\u2019m not going after Jiho and his lackeys. I\u2019m coming after you.\u201d</p><p>Principal Song\u2019s eyes narrowed to shining black slits. \u201cThat sounded like a threat, Jeon Jungkook,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd threats will not be tolerated at this school.\u201d Then he straightened up, standing eye to eye once again with the boy. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer suspended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWai\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re expelled.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook could feel the anger churning in his belly like an ocean in a hurricane. His fists clenched at his sides and his jaw became prominent as he ground his teeth together.</p><p>\u201cNow, if you don\u2019t want the police to get involved, I suggest getting off school grounds immediately.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook watched out of the tops of his eyes as the man turned and strolled away and into his office. The whole inner wall was glass so Jungkook could see him go all the way across the room to sit at his oak desk. When the principal was finally seated, he looked up, locking eyes with Jungkook before reaching slowly for the phone. Obviously, he\u2019d been serious when he said he\u2019d call the police on Jungkook if he didn\u2019t leave right then. What else could Jungkook do but go? He couldn\u2019t go back to tell Jimin what happened. He couldn\u2019t return the next week to walk him to his classes. It was over.</p><p>With a defeated sigh, his angry expression fell and his eyes slid from the principal\u2019s down to the floor as he trudged toward the exit. What was he going to tell Jimin?</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook waited at the bus stop across the street from the school until the students were let out at the end of the day. He couldn\u2019t risk being caught on the property and getting the cops called on him, so when he finally saw Jimin coming out the front doors, he jumped to his feet and waited anxiously there on the other side of the crosswalk like a dog at the end of his leash. His eyes followed the boy closely, never straying as Jimin pulled his hood up over his faded orange hair. He watched him make his way across the street, his hands jammed deep into the pocket of his hoodie. Watched him glance his way before shaking his head and trudging past him down the sidewalk.</p><p>Jungkook knew he looked ridiculous trailing after the boy like a puppy but he couldn\u2019t help it. He needed to apologize. Needed to explain. Needed Jimin to stop ignoring him. Please, just stop ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cJiminie, just stop for a second. Please,\u201d Jungkook finally said, grabbing the smaller boy\u2019s arm and spinning him around to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hit him, Jungkook?\u201d Jimin asked. He set his jaw in a hard line, his eyes drilling into Jungkook\u2019s and for the first time, Jungkook actually felt intimidated by his icy stare. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Jungkook looked back at the school again. It was several blocks away now. Jimin had gone pretty far before Jungkook caught up to him. \u201cI just need to tell you something\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin said. \u201cTell me exactly what you were thinking. Tell me why you thought it would be a good idea to punch Jiho <i>at school</i> when you know that they\u2019ve been cracking down on their whole <i>no violence</i> policy, which is a load of crap, by the way, since apparently Jiho doesn\u2019t even need to touch me to mess with me every day. And now, you\u2019ve gone and gotten yourself suspended so what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpelled.\u201d</p><p>Jimin went silent.</p><p>Jungkook didn\u2019t want to meet his eyes. He kicked at a clump of moss sticking up from between a crack in the sidewalk. Stuffed his hands in his pockets and grabbed at the lint that had collected in the seams. Rolled his tongue against his cheek. Until finally, the silence was too heavy to bear and he had to look up. </p><p>Jimin\u2019s icy facade had melted, leaving a stricken expression on his pale face. His lips were slightly parted, his shoulders heaving and then his fingers flew up into his hair and panic filled his eyes. \u201cY-you what?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Jungkook wished he could take everything back. Wished he hadn\u2019t let Jiho\u2019s comment about Taehyung get to him. Wished he\u2019d controlled the fire raging in him. Wished he\u2019d fought the urge to hit him. Wished he hadn\u2019t just uttered the one word that could make his friend suddenly look so scared.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s breathing turned ragged and he raked his quivering hands down his face. \u201cExpelled?\u201d he cracked. \u201cYou got expelled? I won\u2019t have you? I won\u2019t have Tae? Jiho will\u2026\u201d He staggered, almost crashing into the bushes lining the sidewalk if not for Jungkook reaching out and grabbing him. The boy\u2019s skin felt clammy, his whole body trembling. Jungkook had seen his friend have plenty of anxiety attacks but this was completely different. A panic attack worse than any he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Jiminie,\u201d Jungkook whispered as he sank down onto the curb, enveloping the boy in his arms, letting him crumble into his chest as he descended further into panic. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. You won\u2019t be alone. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Jungkook knew he was making empty promises. He wasn\u2019t allowed back on school property. Tae wasn\u2019t going back to school, at the very least, until after his trial and that was only if he was found not guilty. And even then, school would be over anyway. Jimin was right. He was all alone. And it was Jungkook\u2019s fault.</p><p>*</p><p>It had been almost eight years since he lost his parents and the memories, the details, had faded over time. But sometimes, out of nowhere, his mom or dad\u2019s face would appear in his mind with startling detail, leaving him breathless.</p><p>This time it was a dream that they appeared to him in. More of a nightmare, really. He could see the crash happening. Hear the collision. The jarring sound of tires squealing, brakes seizing, glass and metal crumpling. He saw his mom\u2019s terror-filled eyes and heard her scream his name. And then he woke up.</p><p>It took him a second to realize he was laying on the floor in Jimin\u2019s room instead of sprawling across the backseat of a car. A layer of cold sweat coated his naked torso and matted his hair down to his forehead.</p><p>He heard a groan just then and watched as Jimin\u2019s arm stirred where it lay slung over the edge of his mattress. \u201cJungkook-ah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jungkook said sitting up and pressing his palms into his eyes. \u201cJust had a nightmare, Jiminie. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>With another barely-awake groan, Jimin rolled over to face the wall. Jungkook peered at him from over the edge of the bed. The boy\u2019s blankets had slipped off of him in the night and now he lay curled into a ball, his cotton pants riding up his legs to expose his boney ankles. He was so small. Too small.</p><p>Jungkook got up quietly and tugged Jimin\u2019s blanket back in place over his body. The boy nuzzled his pillow, never opening his eyes but letting out a contented sigh. At least he seemed to be having good dreams. With a sharp breath to clear his head, Jungkook reached for his shirt and tugged it on then grabbed his hoodie and slipped from the room quietly.</p><p>The whole house was dark and silent, the place awash in cold, blue light cast by the streetlamp that filtered in through the filmy curtains covering the windows. Jimin\u2019s house was nice. Not super nice like Jin\u2019s, but homey, comfortable. Jungkook felt a stab of jealousy in his gut as he made his way to the entryway where his shoes were. He passed walls lined with photos of Jimin in different stages of growing up. Family photos and birthday photos and school photos. Jungkook hadn\u2019t lived in a house where his picture adorned a wall in a long time. Having been shuffled from one place to the next so many times had made him forget what it was even like to have a place to call his. Sure, he\u2019d been with his current caretakers for a few years now but he\u2019d never go so far as to call those people his family or that house his home.</p><p>After pulling his shoes on, Jungkook unlocked and opened the front door quietly. It was unusually warm for a spring night but Jungkook welcomed the feeling of the wind on his face. He\u2019d woken up with goosebumps dotting his skin and this was the comfort he needed to wash away the image of his mom\u2019s terror-filled eyes.</p><p>He often went for walks when he needed to clear his head. So much had happened that day that this walk was necessary. Heck, the past several months had been nothing but one hit after another. From Taehyung killing his dad to getting arrested, to Yoongi suddenly flipping out on Jin and tossing Jungkook out like a piece of trash. Jungkook sucked in a sharp breath at that last thought. </p><p>He\u2019d made it to the end of Jimin\u2019s street, past the mini mart and out onto the main road that ran through the city. He wasn\u2019t sure where he was headed but it didn\u2019t really matter anyway. He could go on forever and no one would miss him. He already was nothing but a burden on the people that knew him. And he\u2019d let down the only one that didn\u2019t see him as such.</p><p>After hearing the same words for the past eight years of his life, that he was only as good as the money he brought in, that he needed to stop relying on others to take care of him, that he needed to grow up and be a man, it was hard to not believe it was all true. And then there was Jimin. His best friend and the boy that relied on him more than anyone else. The boy that trusted him to keep him safe and he\u2019d failed. Failed at his one responsibility.</p><p>Jungkook cut across the street and around a corner. The school loomed in front of him, its tall, white stone clocktower raising up to pierce the sky like a blade. Jungkook sat down on the bench he\u2019d waited for Jimin on earlier in the day and rested his head in his hands.</p><p>That dream had really shaken him. Had brought everything back. And now the hole in his chest that had finally begun to shrink with time felt gaping again. Without any warning, his chest contracted and he let out a sob. Then the tears came.</p><p>He buried his face in his arms, crumpling into a ball there on the bench as he cried. His voice echoed down the street, filling the darkness with sounds of anguish. He didn\u2019t know how long he cried but when he finally looked up again, his lungs hurt and his eyes burned.</p><p>Jungkook leaned back, resting his head against the back of the bench so he could look up at the sky. The city lights washed out most of the stars but the brightest ones were still visible. Shining and twinkling the way stars do, completely unaware or maybe uncaring of the trivial problems of humans. Stars have much bigger things to worry about.</p><p>With a heavy sigh Jungkook got up again. The air had cooled significantly since he left Jimin\u2019s house and now he hunched his shoulders forward and shoved his hands deep into his pockets to brace himself against the chill. He was exhausted and only now did he regret leaving the house in the first place. It was going to be a long, cold walk back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even see the car flying down the road toward him. The driver apparently didn\u2019t see him either because they didn\u2019t even attempt to slow down before plowing into him. The whole thing happened so quickly that Jungkook didn\u2019t know it until he landed on the road on his back with a sickening crunch. The impact ripped all of the air from his lungs and he lay there for several panicking seconds as he tried to will them to expand again. When he finally was able to pull in a breath, he knew something was wrong. He couldn\u2019t inhale right. When he tried to move his legs, they wouldn\u2019t budge. He couldn\u2019t feel anything. Something was definitely wrong.</p><p>His heart pounded in his chest and he could hear how ragged and shallow his breathing was. His vision blurred with every beat. The air grew thick and suddenly he felt like he was drowning. Panic washed over him like a wave and his unfocused eyes watched as the surface grew more and more distant. He was sinking further. Falling into the dark depths of the unknown.</p><p><i>Please, no. Please, not here. Not like this.</i></p><p>Jungkook could feel himself being tugged further down and he grit his teeth, struggling against current. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn\u2019t fight it. He could feel his energy draining. Feel his heartbeat weakening. The sound of it slowing seemed to surround him until it was all he could hear. Until there was nothing but him, floating in this black ocean, listening to his dying pulse.</p><p><i>Please\u2026not like this.</i></p><p>He thought of Jimin, sleeping peacefully in his bed. He thought of Tae who still constantly wore that haunted look on his face. Of Hoseok and how lifeless he\u2019d become. Of Namjoon and how much he beat himself up over letting Tae down. Of Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cYoongi.\u201d</p><p>The name left Jungkook\u2019s lips in a cracked wheeze. His throat constricted and it took him several more seconds and too much energy to force the muscles to relax so he could breathe again.</p><p>What he wouldn\u2019t give to see Yoongi again. He just wanted to hear his voice. Wanted to hear him assure him that everything would be okay. That he would get through this. That what happened with Jimin wasn\u2019t his fault. Though he knew it was.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to die alone.</i></p><p>A sob broke free of Jungkook\u2019s throat and he took in another gasping breath before plunging below the surface of the dark ocean again. Memories of his life floated around him in the darkness. As if watching silent movies on a projector, his eyes roved over the familiar scenes. Of when he met Jimin, and the rest of the guys. When they had their first beach day. Of one of the many parties at Yoongi\u2019s where Jungkook spent the whole time on the couch stuffed between Jimin and Tae while playing video games. Of the first time he went to Yoongi after his fake dad told him he was worthless. Yoongi pulling him in for a hug, his arms holding Jungkook\u2019s broken pieces together. And finally, his eyes fell on a memory. A memory of him and his parents the night before his seventh birthday when the three of them were making cupcakes and he and his dad ended up getting into a frosting fight.</p><p>He focused on his parents\u2019 faces. On the laugh lines creasing the corners of his mom\u2019s eyes. On the gray flecks of scruff peppering his dad\u2019s chin. These were the things he had forgotten over the years. The things that were so vivid and real to him now.</p><p>Suddenly the thought of dying didn\u2019t terrify him anymore. Now, instead, Jungkook could only feel an undeniable sense of peace. He\u2019d finally get to be with his parents. He\u2019d finally have a family again. He was so close to the edge, he could feel it.</p><p>At last, he opened his eyes. The black sky stretched above him and through the blurry film of tears, he could still make out the stars. Now they didn\u2019t seem like cold, uncaring orbs of light in the distance. They were much closer. So close he\u2019d be able to reach out and brush them with his fingertips if he had the strength.</p><p><i>Kook-ah. What do you think you\u2019re doing?</i></p><p>Jungkook blinked hard and sighed. \u201cYoongi-hyung?\u201d he uttered, his words drawn out and slurred. He could feel himself fading fast.</p><p><i>Just hold on, Kook. Just keep fighting.</i></p><p>Jungkook\u2019s heart rate plunged again, his thoughts suddenly foggy. It was getting harder to breathe. \u201cI-I can\u2019t\u2026hyung.\u201d</p><p><i>Do it for us, Kook. Please. Do it for Jimin.</i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026too\u2026\u201d Jungkook could feel himself drifting in and out of consciousness, \u201clate\u2026for Jimin.\u201d</p><p><i>Bull.</i></p><p>A puff of air escaped his nose in a weak laugh. He couldn\u2019t help feeling a twinge of sadness at the thought of leaving his friends behind. He felt the warmth of fresh tears spring to his eyes when he thought about the moments he\u2019d shared with them. The parties, the jokes, the meals at the diner. He\u2019d had nothing until he met them, and then they were his everything. He couldn\u2019t leave without saying goodbye.</p><p>With his teeth gritted against the pain, Jungkook slid his arm along the pavement, scraping the exposed skin of his wrist across the ground as he reached for his pocket. His energy was draining fast and he knew he didn\u2019t have much longer. By the time his fingers brushed the hem of his pocket, he was breathing hard. Just a little bit further. A choked sob fell from his lips when he realized his pocket was empty. His phone wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Exhausted, he let his head fall to the side, his fading vision landing on the cracked black device sitting next to him. He felt like he was going to cry with relief. His arm was too heavy to lift and for a few seconds he stared helplessly at his phone, the sound of his heartbeat slowing in his ears. But then he pulled in a breath.</p><p>\u201cHey Siri,\u201d he wheezed and then waited with bated breath until at last, the screen of his phone came to life and his mouth nudged up into a weak, triumphant smile. \u201cCall\u2026\u201d Who could he call? \u201cCall Seokjin,\u201d he finally said. As the screen changed, he waited, closing his eyes and letting the sound of the ringing fill his head. It took four agonizing rings before Jungkook heard the sound of someone answering.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s face crumpled at the sound of the familiar voice and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to speak.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Jin\u2019s voice echoed again. \u201cJungkook-ah?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sucked in as deep of a breath as he could. \u201cHyung?\u201d he cracked.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah? Do you know what time it is? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook opened his mouth to respond but instead, a sob pushed its way out.</p><p>\u201cJungkook? What happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d The older boy\u2019s voice rose with panic.</p><p>\u201cI tried, hyung\u201d he whispered letting his cheek fall to the pavement. He squeezed his eyes shut as another cry tumbled out. \u201cI failed. I failed Jimin\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what? Jungkook, where are you? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI failed Yoongi-hyung\u2026\u201d</p><p>On the other end of the line, Jungkook could hear faint rustling sounds as Jin got out of bed and started fumbling around in his room. \u201cJust stay on the line with me. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook took in a wheezing breath as his surroundings began to fade. He tried to keep his eyes focused on the glowing screen of his phone where it lay close to his head. He couldn\u2019t feel his body anymore. He couldn\u2019t feel the cold air, or the rumbling pavement. He couldn\u2019t hear the sirens in the distance or the fact that they were growing closer.</p><p>\u201cJust tell the guys I love them. Tell them I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered as the tears slipped past his eyelashes and slid down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, stop,\u201d Jin cracked. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. Just tell me where you are.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook tried to open his mouth again, tried to draw in another breath but he was too tired. Too far gone. Instead, he closed his eyes, listening to Jin go on, his voice distorting as he yelled into the receiver. At least he wasn\u2019t alone anymore.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5278d232b602c34d39793022179c7c5d/tumblr_inline_plriraA9Do1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp0ciuWY1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>08. Butterfly</b></h2><p><i>Before the gaps are too wide. Before the whole thing becomes useless.</i><br/></p><p><b>May.</b></p><p>It had been a week since Hoseok had gotten the call from a distraught Jimin that Jungkook had been hit by a car. He\u2019d rushed to throw his clothes on and swipe his keys off his dresser before tearing out of his house so quickly, the walls trembled with the slam of the door. His poor car could barely keep up with how hard he laid on the gas pedal, the tires protesting loudly around every turn. Luckily, there were no other cars out at this hour because, though he was driving fast, Hoseok couldn\u2019t actually see very clearly through the panicked tears that blurred his vision.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d gotten to the hospital, they\u2019d already taken Jungkook back. He saw Jin first. The boy looked like he\u2019d been woken out of a dead sleep, his face all puffy, his hair sticking out every which way, a hoodie thrown on over his white t-shirt and sweatpants. He was bent at an odd angle over the arm of the chair, leaning into the one next to him.</p><p>It was only when the younger boy lifted his head that Hoseok saw that it was Jimin crumpled in Jin\u2019s arms. He was trembling, his small hands in his hair, his face so red and puffy that his eyes were just dark slits. He didn\u2019t even have a coat on. Just his light blue, cotton pajamas and a pair of shoes.</p><p>\u201cHobi-hyung?\u201d he cracked, his voice breaking.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart dropped at the sound of his voice and he rushed forward falling to his knees in front of him. \u201cWhat happened? Is Jungkook\u2026did he\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Jin said as steadily as he could, though Hoseok could still detect a hitch in his voice. The oldest was trying so hard to keep it together for Jimin. \u201cThey just took him back a couple minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t breathing well,\u201d Jimin added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d His bottom lip quivered and he pulled it into his mouth and shook his head. Then his face twisted in anguish and he fell forward with a sob, his head landing on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Hoseok immediately wrapped his arms around the younger boy\u2019s neck and stroked his hair, whispering gentle reassurances in his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Namjoon?\u201d Jin asked quietly. \u201cI texted him. Figured he\u2019d come with you.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok looked up to meet his eyes. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s working tonight.\u201d Namjoon had been staying at Hoseok\u2019s house now for a couple of weeks and had finally gotten a job doing night shift janitorial work at an office building. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll see your text before\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doors to the waiting room burst open as Namjoon\u2014still in his work coveralls\u2014stumbled in. His eyes were wide as they scanned the room before settling on the three boys in the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked hurrying toward them. \u201cI got a text from Jin-hyung about Jungkook\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in an accident, Joonie,\u201d Hoseok whispered.</p><p>At the sight of Jimin still limp against Hoseok\u2019s shoulder, Namjoon deflated entirely, his face going pale, his jaw slackening. He looked to Jin. \u201cIs he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Jin said cutting him off.</p><p>\u201cWell, did anyone call Yoongi-hyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTae\u2019s trying to get ahold of him right now,\u201d Jin said.</p><p>The four were silent for a while. The almost empty waiting room seemed too cold, too bright, too harsh for the situation. Hoseok wished he could turn all the lights off. He just wanted to shield Jimin from everything. From the prying, mock-sympathetic eyes of the few other people sitting in there. From the sounds of reception\u2014the hushed conversations, the joking banter of the staff just trying to make it through their shift. It wasn\u2019t right. Their friend was <i>dying</i>. Why did nobody else care?</p><p>*</p><p>Jimin had spent all of his free time at the hospital after that. Though they\u2019d gotten word a few hours after getting there the first night that Jungkook was stable but unconscious and that his condition had stayed pretty much the same all week, Jimin still went. Still sat in the waiting room, asking anyone that came out of the swinging doors if there had been any change. There never was.</p><p>Hoseok would accompany him on the days he felt he could drag himself out of bed, which wasn\u2019t often.</p><p>It had been eight months since he threw his painkillers in the bonfire on Beach Day and he\u2019d been regretting it every day since then. The first few weeks were spent in his bed, his skin clammy and feverish as he fought through the withdrawals. He\u2019d tried quitting cold turkey before but had never lasted longer than a week before going back to them. He never thought he\u2019d make it this far. Though if the withdrawal symptoms didn\u2019t let up soon, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. He didn\u2019t know how much more of this pain he could take.</p><p>It had been three years since Hoseok\u2019s accident. Only two months of that were supposed to be with the painkillers and then he was supposed to be prescribed something weaker. But the severe pain lasted and the longer Hoseok stayed on his opioids, the further into addiction he fell, until he couldn\u2019t even function in the morning without first popping a few pills.</p><p>Three years. Three years of wandering through life in a fog. Of never being able to get his hands to stop quivering, and he could feel it, even if no one else noticed. Of pretending that he wasn\u2019t higher than a kite\u2014especially around his friends. He\u2019d gotten really good at faking normal. It had become the only normal he knew.</p><p>*</p><p>Before his accident, Hoseok had been an incredible dancer. He\u2019d been doing it practically since he could walk and he was well on his way to becoming one of the best street dancers to ever come out of South Korea. His path was set. He had performing arts colleges lining up to accept him, scholarships already promised to him while he was still in middle school. A lot rested on his shoulders.</p><p>Then the night before his tenth grade showcase, he\u2019d decided to stay late after rehearsal. He\u2019d gone through his routine so many times, he knew every twist, every pop, every step perfectly, but still he just wanted to make sure. Had to make sure he had it positively nailed. That even the nerves over the fact that there were going to be college scouts in the audience watching his every move didn\u2019t distract him.</p><p>That night ended his dance career before it even had a chance to start. Hoseok didn\u2019t remember falling. In fact, looking back, he couldn\u2019t really remember anything from that night other than staring up at the ceiling in his hospital bed for literally hours, his head set up in an uncomfortable neck brace, and just letting the tears fall. His dreams were shattered the moment he heard the words \u201csevere spinal injury\u201d. There was no hope for a full recovery.</p><p>*</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s mom had been running the dance studio since before Hoseok was born. She used to bring him with her to work when he was just a baby, her students fawning over him, pinching his tiny cheeks and passing him around between them during their down time. As he grew up, he\u2019d join the classes, picking up on the choreography so quickly and so well that when he was finally old enough to be a student at the studio, his mom put him in with the advanced class. Even then, he spent more time helping her come up with the routines and teaching the class rather than being taught. Eventually, she gave him his own weekly slots to teach in. He loved it. He loved creating routines and watching as his students began nailing them, mirroring him and showing his own creation to him. He loved teaching the little, little kids, standing back amusedly watching them completely ignore his direction and do their own thing. More than that, though, he loved in the evenings after the last class had left, when the studio closed for the night and his mom had gone home.</p><p>He\u2019d stay there, just him in the empty studio, the lights down and everything washed in blue darkness. He loved dancing in the dark\u2014in the dim light so he could only catch his reflection in the mirror when he was moving. It made him look like he was a part of the air. Like he was moving through water. A spirit, caught up in the slivers of moonlight for just a flash before he melted back into the darkness again. It helped him to feel the music better. To come up with his intricate choreography. It made him well-known in the city for being such a good choreographer. A ray of sunlight that liked to dance in the darkness. A contradiction almost as beautiful as the way he moved.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cStill no change?\u201d Hoseok asked Jimin after the younger boy had slid into the passenger seat of his car. It was Thursday, and Thursday meant group therapy. When Jimin wasn\u2019t at the hospital, Taehyung was. Together, the two of them made sure that there would never be a chance of missing any new information.</p><p>Jimin looked down at his phone once he\u2019d settled into his seat, his thumb gliding over the smooth surface of his black screen. \u201cI guess not,\u201d he uttered then looked up at Hoseok. \u201cTae would tell me right away if there was, right?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok nodded quickly, not giving Jimin a chance to doubt it even further. \u201cOf course he would,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no news is good news, right? It means Jungkook isn\u2019t getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr improving.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok bit the inside of his cheek. While his youngest friend\u2019s health was staying pretty much the same, Jimin\u2019s was getting worse. Without the protection of Taehyung or Jungkook, Jimin was now fully exposed to relentless tormenting from Jiho. Hoseok himself had called the school and talked to the principal but the man had said that they can\u2019t do anything unless Jiho physically touches the boy. It was like they didn\u2019t care about the fact that this was very obviously affecting Jimin mentally. Had there not been enough stories already on the news and online of kids killing themselves over bullying? Did no one care or even realize that words can do so much more damage?</p><p>Every day, Jimin was stepping onto the battle field the moment he entered the school building. Every day he faced an onslaught of mental assault. High school had become a war zone for him and Hoseok noticed every time he saw the boy that he was fighting a losing battle. The scars weren\u2019t visible but they were deep and they\u2019d be there forever. And no one would do a thing about it unless Jiho touched him.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Jimin?\u201d Hoseok asked knowing full well that the answer was not going to be good.</p><p>Jimin didn\u2019t respond at first. He just kept his eyes focused on the phone in his lap. His bottom lip quivered and his thumb continued to trace circles on his phone screen. Finally, he took in a shuddering breath. \u201cI miss him, Hobi-hyung\u2026\u201d he whispered. His breath hitched. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t know if I can take much more\u2026\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart splintered in his chest and he gripped the steering wheel tighter. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me what would help and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>At last, Jimin looked up to meet Hoseok\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me he\u2019s going to make it. Tell me everything will be okay.\u201d Jimin swallowed hard. \u201cTell me it\u2019ll all go back to normal again.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok closed his eyes and thought back to Beach Day. How could so much change in eight months when the group\u2019s friendship had never wavered in five years? Hoseok couldn\u2019t even remember the last time the seven of them had hung out without it somehow ending in an argument. Everything was different. And after Yoongi had gone off on Jin, kicked everyone out and moved, Hoseok didn\u2019t think anything would ever return to normal. At last, he opened his eyes again, turning his head to meet Jimin\u2019s. He could feel the fatigue keeping his eyelids from lifting all the way. His chest felt hollow and his bones felt heavy. But still, he pulled his mouth up into a smile. One not nearly as bright as the smiles he\u2019d produced in the past.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll all be okay, Jimin,\u201d he said, trying to make his words as convincing as possible. He knew he was lying. He knew nothing would ever go back to the way it was before. But that look on Jimin\u2019s face. That darkness, that dull absence of the spark that always used to light his eyes, that kept him going even though there was so much trying to push him back. It was all so present that Hoseok would say anything to give him just a little bit of hope. Just something to live for. He reached over and gripped the younger boy\u2019s hand. Jimin\u2019s skin was dry and loose, like there was too much of it for his shrinking body. \u201cI promise,\u201d Hoseok added onto the end.</p><p>The corner of Jimin\u2019s mouth twitched upward for just a second, as if that was as much of a smile as he could muster and then he nodded and turned away to look out the window at the students that had congregated in front of the school. Hoseok watched him for a moment longer. He could almost feel the longing Jimin felt as he watched the others interact. It looked so easy. So unattainable.</p><p><i>Please God, let things get better,</i> Hoseok pleaded silently, then shifted gears and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHoseok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom,\u201d Hoseok called back. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d He kicked his shoes off and tossed his keys onto the console table inside the door.</p><p>He heard commotion in the kitchen and followed the sounds until he reached the doorway, then he stopped. His mom leaned back against the counter, a glass of wine in her hand. Just about a foot away, stood a man he\u2019d never met before. The two had obviously been standing closer, doing who knows what\u2014though with the flushed look on Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2019s face, he could take a guess.</p><p>\u201cSeoki honey, this is Seojoon. I met him yesterday at the supermarket.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok just looked at the man who looked back and raised his hand in an awkward wave. \u201cHi,\u201d he said and Hoseok gave him a haphazard smile before shuffling over to the fridge.</p><p>\u201cHoseok used to help me at the dance studio,\u201d his mom continued completely ignoring the fact that her son hadn\u2019t given her new friend the warmest greeting, \u201che was an amazing dancer.\u201d</p><p><i>Is she seriously talking about me as if I\u2019m not even here? </i>Hoseok pulled a bottle of iced tea out of the fridge and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cHis father and I had pretty high hopes for him before his accident.\u201d</p><p>Her words grated on his nerves, feeling like fingernails raking down his spine and he spun to face her. This new man friend of hers just nodded uncomfortably, his eyes barely even sympathetic. Of course he didn\u2019t want to hear about her poor poor son. In fact, he probably had been expecting a lot less talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my room,\u201d Hoseok uttered then left the kitchen before his mom could say anything.</p><p>By the time he reached his bedroom and closed his door, his head was pounding. Therapy hadn\u2019t been something he\u2019d taken seriously in a long time but he still went for Jimin. And because it kept him out of the house for that much longer.</p><p>His mom and dad had split just a year after his accident, saying it had nothing to do with him even though he knew that was a lie. The only thing that had kept them together before that was their determination for their son to become a professional dancer. He\u2019d never even really seen them in the same room together unless it was absolutely necessary. They\u2019d spend dinners talking excitedly about Hoseok\u2019s next show or some new college that wanted him, but then once those conversations came to an end, there was nothing else to say. At least not to each other. They didn\u2019t care about the other\u2019s careers, didn\u2019t care about how the other was doing. It was all about Hoseok. Well, it was all about Hoseok as long as fame and fortune were in his future. Once those dreams went out the window, so did their marriage. It had been a loveless one anyway so what was the point?</p><p>Hoseok hadn\u2019t talked to his dad since the split. He\u2019d gotten a couple postcards in the mail from whatever new place his dad had traveled to but he hadn\u2019t gotten one in over a year. And his mom might as well have been absent. She spent some of her time at the studio and most out with strange men. This was the first one she\u2019d brought back to the house, though. A stranger in Hoseok\u2019s home. It made him sick to his stomach.</p><p>He lay down on his bed and unscrewed the cap from his drink as he stared up at the ceiling. His shoulders were achy and stiff, as per usual at this time in the evening. He\u2019d been taking much weaker painkillers just to take the edge off while he went through his detox, but he found that the low dosage was no longer doing enough for him. And he just always wanted to sleep. He wished he could sleep, but the pain kept him awake. The pain in his neck, in his shoulders, his spine.</p><p>With a sigh, Hoseok reached blindly for the bottle of Tylenol on his bedside table. The pills rattled in the container loudly, almost taunting him. <i>Take as many as you want. It still won\u2019t be enough.</i> He popped the cap off and tipped the bottle toward his mouth. Once he felt four land on his tongue, he recapped the bottle and took a swig of his tea to wash it down. He could feel them scrape all the way down his throat, flowing with the cold liquid to settle into the pit of his stomach like rocks.</p><p>He closed his eyes and listened to the familiar sounds of his room. His computer humming softly under his desk, the baseboard heater creaking as it turned on, the muted ticking of his analog alarm clock. These were the sounds that usually kept him awake at night. He could hear the shower turn off in the bathroom\u2014he hadn\u2019t even noticed it until it turned off, the silence becoming more absolute. Namjoon must have been getting ready to go to work. A couple minutes later, he heard the door open and close.</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Namjoon said to him and he opened one eye to see the younger boy coming out in his boxers and using a towel to dry off his pale blonde hair. \u201cHow\u2019s Jimin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean Jungkook?\u201d Hoseok asked sleepily.</p><p>Namjoon crossed the room to where his stuff was. He always kept his corner neat and tidy. He already didn\u2019t like the fact that he was encroaching on Hoseok\u2019s personal space so keeping his stuff as contained as possible was a must. At least in his eyes. Hoseok had told him time and time again that he didn\u2019t mind him staying. That he, in fact, enjoyed the company, especially, on nights when Namjoon was off and would stay up talking with Hoseok when the pain kept him awake.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, Jimin,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Jungkook is getting all the care he needs. Jimin however\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well, Joon,\u201d Hoseok interrupted and closed his eyes again. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing well.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon was silent for a few seconds then sighed. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok swiped his tongue over his bottom lip then sat up quickly. \u201cDid you see my mom brought someone home?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon let out a chuckle as he grabbed his work coveralls out of his stack of neatly folded clothes beside his pillow and stepped into them. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said as he tugged them on. \u201cI scared the crap out of him when I came home from the hospital earlier.\u201d He\u2019d been there keeping Taehyung company for a couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Tae\u2019s trial is the day after tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Hoseok said. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nervous wreck but that\u2019s to be expected,\u201d Namjoon said as he pulled his work beanie down over his head. \u201cJin\u2019s dad thinks he\u2019ll be able to get him off with a temporary insanity claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never caught, were you?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked down at his hands and bit the inside of his cheek. He shook his head. \u201cTae won\u2019t let me confess. He told the police he did everything himself. If I say anything, it could ruin his trial. They\u2019d throw both of us in jail.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said anything as they both mulled over that last statement. Here Jungkook was in the hospital, Jimin was going through his own personal Hell and Yoongi had ostracized himself from the rest of them, not to mention Jin had basically fallen off the face of the earth having not returned for a weekend from school since going to the hospital that first night. Taehyung and Namjoon going to jail would be the nail in the coffin. The group was so close to breaking, it wouldn\u2019t take much more to completely destroy them.</p><p>*</p><p>Namjoon had left a couple hours before and the sounds of Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2019s awful flirting had finally died down, leaving Hoseok alone in the silence. He lay on his back in his bed, the lights off because even though he\u2019d taken that Tylenol, his head was still pounding. With a sigh, he grabbed his phone off the mattress next to him and turned it on. The screen was bright, sending a spike of pain through his eyes and into his skull. He couldn\u2019t dim it fast enough. When the ache subsided a bit, he opened his chat with Jimin.</p><p><b>hows it going?</b></p><p><b>\u2026</b></p><p><b>Jimin: at the hospital. Something happened</b></p><p><b>Wat is it? JK?</b></p><p><b>Jimin: could you come?</b></p><p><b>On my way.</b></p><p><b>*</b></p><p>Hoseok reached the hospital in record time. Faster than the first night. Jimin was alone in the waiting room, sitting in the chair with his head in his hands. When he looked up, his face was red, his eyes shining. Before Hoseok could take another step, Jimin got up, walking over to him as he wiped his face with the sleeves of his oversized sweatshirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hoseok asked.</p><p>Jimin wouldn\u2019t look at him. Instead, he kept his eyes trained on his fidgeting fingers in front of his stomach. \u201cH-he crashed and it took them a long time to get him stable again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know why?\u201d Hoseok asked feeling weak all of a sudden. He reached out to grab Jimin\u2019s arms, more for his own balance than to comfort the younger boy.</p><p>Jimin just shook his head. \u201cThey have to do some sort of exploratory\u2026thing. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre his foster parents here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were here for like an hour, earlier,\u201d Jimin said with a sniff.</p><p>The fact that Taehyung and Jimin were basically living at the hospital while Jungkook\u2019s fake parents had barely made any sort of appearance over the past month had his stomach churning with anger.</p><p>Finally Jimin lifted his head, a bruise becoming apparent on his cheekbone. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hoseok asked nodding toward it.</p><p>Jimin brought a hand up to rub at the bruise. \u201cJiho hit my locker door while it was open and it hit me in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I see this earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI covered it up.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok raked a hand through his hair. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d claim it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok hated Jiho. Hated him more than Jungkook\u2019s fake parents. Hated him more than his dad for abandoning him. Hated him more than his mom for bringing strange men into their home. He used to get his anger out in the studio. It was the only way to help him work through it. Then he relied on his pills. But he didn\u2019t have those anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, Hobi-hyung,\u201d Jimin said at last breaking Hoseok out of his thoughts.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s face fell. He <i>was</i> tired. Always tired.</p><p>\u201cGo home and try to sleep,\u201d Jimin said and pushed him gently backward toward the exit again. \u201cI\u2019ll call you if I hear anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be alone, Jimin,\u201d Hoseok said.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung is on his way.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok couldn\u2019t tell if it was a lie or not but his skin was crawling and he needed some fresh air. So with a sharp nod and one last reassuring brush of his hand against Jimin\u2019s arm, he left.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to go home. He didn\u2019t want to stare up at the ceiling, his mind racing, his body aching as he tried to go to sleep. He didn\u2019t really know what he wanted. But somehow, he ended up at the studio. It looked abandoned. His mom had been working there a lot less, letting it fall to the wayside. But still, just the sight of it filled Hoseok\u2019s chest with warmth. He hadn\u2019t been there in years.</p><p>*</p><p>The sound of the light switch flipping on echoed through the empty studio. Hoseok stood there in the doorway for several seconds as his eyes adjusted to the suddenly bright room. A wall of mirrors loomed in front of him, his gaze meeting the one reflected back at him. He looked terrified. He felt terrified.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t stepped foot in the studio since before his accident. Sure, he\u2019d spent late nights in his room attempting to move the way he used to be able to, but those times always ended in pain and a trickle of angry tears. Those were the nights he\u2019d find himself reaching for his pills, swallowing more than he needed. The high didn\u2019t fill the gaping hole in his chest, though. The place where his passion had once burned bright. As bright as he was.</p><p>Everyone that knew him before his accident would say he was sunshine in human form. He always had a smile on his face that glowed almost as brightly as his sparkling eyes and his golden skin. He looked like a child of summer, made of everything that was pure and warm in the world. But that light had died there in his hospital room. He\u2019d felt it leave his body, as if his very soul had floated away, leaving him feeling cold and empty. The only light he\u2019d felt since then was the illusion created by the pills he took. Artificial sunlight. Nothing but fake happiness that faded with the high and left him exhausted and miserable all night long.</p><p>*</p><p>His footsteps sounded hollow as he made his way over to the speaker system. He plugged his phone into the stereo and shuffled through his music until he came to the right song. Then he picked the small controller up off the top of the stereo and made his way to the center of the room. For several seconds, he stood there in silence, looking at his reflection. It was too bright in the room.</p><p>With a huff, Hoseok went over and shut the lights back off, plunging the room into darkness. Much better. Then he went back and stood in the middle of the floor. With a deep breath, he pushed the play button on the remote and the room suddenly filled with music. The first time he\u2019d heard this song, he\u2019d closed his eyes to listen, his mind immediately conjuring up a stage, he in the middle of it. He\u2019d created a whole routine in his mind, playing the song over and over, using his imagination to move the way his body wasn\u2019t able to. He\u2019d practiced the choreography in his mind hundreds of times and now that he was here, now that his feet were planted firmly on the waxed floor of the dance studio, the music pumping out of the speakers, it seemed that this was the pivotal moment. He couldn\u2019t go back. He couldn\u2019t fail. If he did, this was really it.</p><p>He closed his eyes, feeling the music rise in him like the swell of a wave. It filled his chest then overflowed, spilling down his arms and flowing through his veins like electricity. Something ignited in him like a spark to gasoline and he began to move to the music. Immediately, he felt a twinge of pain at the base of his skull and he jerked, catching the back of his neck with a tensed hand. He dug his fingers into his skin, standing motionless until the pain finally began to ebb. <i>Take it slow, Hoseok,</i> he told himself then carefully rolled his neck from side to side, loosening up the muscle.</p><p>With a deep breath to calm his nerves, he started the song over. This time, he didn\u2019t try to replicate the choreography he envisioned. Instead, he only barely moved, making small motions with his body as he went over the dance in his mind. When the song ended, he did it again, this time letting his limbs make larger movements, though still smaller than he wanted.</p><p>He did this over and over, feeling the music and letting it take control slowly. With every reset, he could feel his movements becoming more fluid, more pronounced. With every roll of his body, he tensed for the pain but since his muscles were having a chance to stretch and warm up, it wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>He moved through the darkness, the light from outside streaming in through the windows lining the wall high above the mirrors and he watched his form in the mirror, slipping in and out of the rays. Like a spirit dancing in shafts of moonlight. Still not perfect but getting closer.</p><p>Hoseok had lost count of how many times he played through the song. He just kept hitting the back button, losing himself in the music until finally, he collapsed onto his back, his mouth stretched into the biggest euphoric smile he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>Maybe this was finally the end of his struggle. Maybe he could finally dance again. Finally live his dream. Finally leave the pain and the pills behind.</p><p>He was tired and he could hear his bed calling his name. With a groan, he got back to his feet. He was going to be sore the next day. Probably for several days after this but he didn\u2019t care. For once, he welcomed the pain.</p><p>When he grabbed his phone and unplugged it, he noticed a notification on his screen. A message from Jimin. It had been sent just a few minutes earlier. Hoseok swiped the message and brought his phone up to read it.</p><p><b>Jimin: I know you tried. I know youve done everything you could. I know I\u2019m letting you down. I\u2019m letting you all down. But I cant do this anymore, hyung. Living hurts too much. Existing hurts too much. Youll be fine without me. All of you.</b></p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heavy breaths echoed through the room as he read the text over and over. At last he started typing out his own message.</p><p><b>What do you mean?</b></p><p>He waited less than a minute before sending another.</p><p><b>Jimin</b></p><p>No response.</p><p><b>Jimin answer me now.</b></p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s hands shook as his thumb tapped Jimin\u2019s name. An option came up to call him and he pressed it. As it rang, he sprinted out of the studio, not even bothering to lock it back up before making his way to his car. Voicemail. With a curse, Hoseok hit redial and got into his car. The engine groaned to life and the tires peeled out as he flew out of the parking lot.</p><p>He called over and over again as he drove to Jimin\u2019s house, not even wasting a second between calls before hitting redial again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jimin,\u201d he growled and hit redial again.</p><p>Voicemail.</p><p>With an angry cry, he threw his phone to the passenger side. It cracked against the window before disappearing down into the space between the seat and the door. <i>Please, let him be okay. Please, let him be okay.</i></p><p>The house was dark when Hoseok pulled up to the curb and jumped out. Jimin\u2019s dad was on a business trip for the next couple of weeks and his mom must have been out because the door was locked when Hoseok tried the handle. He banged on it with his fists, screaming Jimin\u2019s name until his hands hurt and when that got him no response, he grabbed one of the bricks lining the path and smashed it into the window beside the door. Ignoring the jagged glass, he reached in and stretched his arm as far over as he could until he was able to undo the deadbolt. The door rattled as he threw it open and rushed inside.</p><p>The place was dark and silent and Hoseok\u2019s panic grew as he went from empty room to empty room.</p><p>\u201cJimin!\u201d he yelled. \u201cJimin, where are you? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>His feet hit the stairs, echoing loudly as he took them two at a time. He flung open Jimin\u2019s bedroom door, eyes roving over the empty space. His shoulders heaved, his breath coming out in ragged wheezes and he whirled around again to face the hallway. The bathroom door was shut at the other end.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s breath caught. \u201cNo, Jimin,\u201d he whispered before running to the door. He tried the handle. Locked. He hit his still aching fist against it. \u201cJimin!\u201d He rattled the handle until he was sure it was going to come loose in his hand. \u201cNo no no no please no.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he backed up and began ramming against it. Wood splintered with every hit and his shoulder burned but he kept throwing himself against the door until at last, it gave in, swinging open with such force that it banged against the adjacent wall. Hoseok fell in landing hard on his knees. The bathroom was pitch black and he pawed at the wall next to the doorframe, finally finding the light switch and flipping it on.</p><p>The bathtub was filled to the brim with water, and there he was, a dark form beneath its surface. Hoseok surged forward and plunged his arms into the water, displacing so much of it that gallons spilled over the edge, drenching him and the bathmat before spreading across the tile floor and toward the carpeted hall.</p><p>He clutched Jimin to his chest, the boy\u2019s hair plastered over his eyes, his skin deathly pale, his lips blue from lack of oxygen.</p><p>\u201cJimin,\u201d Hoseok cried shaking the boy. He lay him on the ground and started pushing hard against his chest. He\u2019d never performed CPR before and he hoped to God he was doing it correctly. Though maybe it didn\u2019t even matter anymore.</p><p>After a few pushes, he pressed his ear against the boy\u2019s chest. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jimin,\u201d he grunted then grabbed the boy by the chin and the top of his head and bent down to try mouth to mouth. Jimin\u2019s lips felt cold and dead against his own but still he tried forcing air into the boy\u2019s lungs. Then he started doing compressions again.</p><p>He switched between the two over and over, his hope fading the longer Jimin went without responding. Tears streamed down his face and his own chest was beginning to ache from taking in such deep breaths to give to Jimin, but he couldn\u2019t stop. He couldn\u2019t give up. Jimin had to live. He had to be alright.</p><p>What could Hoseok do? He needed to call for help. He needed to find a phone. His own cellphone was still wedged between the seat and the passenger side door in his car, but he knew Jimin\u2019s parents had a phone in their room just next door. Should he stop doing CPR? Should he keep going until Jimin\u2019s mom got home? Who knew how long that would be? It would only take a second. Just two steps out of the bathroom, two down the hall and three to get into the bedroom and grab the phone. Then seven back. Could he make it? Could Jimin make it? He didn\u2019t have any other option.</p><p>With a silent plea, Hoseok leaned down to give Jimin one more breath before tearing himself away from the boy. He scrambled across the hall, grabbing the phone off of the nightstand and rushing back to start compressions again. He used one hand to continue to push against Jimin\u2019s chest as hard as he could while his other hand shakily dialed 911. Once the phone was ringing, he dropped it the floor so he could use both hands again.</p><p>\u201c911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease help,\u201d Hoseok said, his voice breaking on the second word. He dropped his head onto Jimin\u2019s chest as a sob racked through him. \u201cPlease come. He\u2019s not breathing\u2026\u201d</p><p>Through the anguish, Hoseok lifted his head again and continued pushing on Jimin\u2019s chest. He could barely hear the operator on the other end but he rattled off the address anyway and then went back to alternating between compressions and breathing into Jimin\u2019s mouth.</p><p>His strength was diminishing. His vision tunneling. Everything was fading and Hoseok knew. He just knew that it was no use. He should just stop. Just come to terms with the fact that Jimin was gone. That he\u2019d failed the boy. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop. It was almost robotic by this point. His body was long passed exhaustion but he couldn\u2019t quit.</p><p>A few minutes later he heard the faint sound of sirens approaching and looked up to see red lights flashing on the ceiling from outside the window. Relief didn\u2019t reach him though as Jimin was still unresponsive.</p><p>\u201cAnyone here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp here!\u201d Hoseok yelled, his voice hoarse.</p><p>A couple seconds later, two blurry shapes rushed into the bathroom, one pulling Hoseok away while the other replaced him doing CPR. Hoseok let the paramedic pull him out of the bathroom and collapsed against the carpet in a tired, wet heap. He couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t see. He could barely think. All he could do was breathe and pray with the last ounce of energy that Jimin would wake up.</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Hoseok finally gained enough strength to sit up, the paramedics had already taken Jimin away in the ambulance. Before they had gone, one paramedic had sat at the top of the stairs with him and asked him some questions. If he knew what happened. How long he\u2019d been doing CPR. He couldn\u2019t answer. He had no idea how long he\u2019d been there. Had no idea how long Jimin was underwater. He wished he knew something.</p><p>After a few more questions that Hoseok didn\u2019t know the answer to, the paramedic gave him a small card with his contact information on it and then they left. Hoseok sat in the dark at the top of the stairs for a long time debating on if he should stick around and wait for Jimin\u2019s mom to get home or not. He didn\u2019t want to. He didn\u2019t want to be in the house anymore. He was soaking wet and cold and exhausted and he just wanted to sleep forever.</p><p>His whole body hurt but somehow he still managed to get to his car and drive home. His mom must have still been out on her date and Namjoon was still at work so the house was silent. Hoseok stumbled into the bathroom, yanking his shirt off over his head and letting it drop to the floor. It hit the tiles with a wet slap.</p><p>His reflection stared back at him. His eyes were dull, defeated, unemotional. He felt as hollow as he looked. Every inch of him was tired. His body felt weak. His thoughts muddled. He could feel himself shutting down. He wanted to sleep. Needed to sleep. Needed to just be done with it all.</p><p>Hoseok reached up and opened the medicine cabinet. He stood there in silence, his eyes scanning the rows of pill bottles until they settled on the bottle of Benadryl. His mom suffered from seasonal allergies so she took these pretty regularly throughout the spring and summer. They always made her really drowsy. Perfect.</p><p>He brought the pill bottle down from its shelf and squinted in the dim light at the writing on the label. Disclaimers jumped out at him. <b>Caution.</b> <b>Warning.</b> <b>Danger</b>. None of those words held a negative meaning for him. They were promises. Promises of sleep.</p><p>With unsteady hands, he popped the cap off and tilted the bottle toward his open hand. The pills rained down, some slipping through the cracks between his fingers and disappearing down the drain but most of them collected in his palm. By the time the bottle was empty, he held a pile of small white pills. With one more glance at himself in the mirror, he lifted his hand and poured them into his mouth. It took several painfully dry swallows but he eventually choked them all down. Then he carefully replaced the lid and put the bottle back in its place on the shelf before leaving the bathroom and walking calmly down the hall to his room.</p><p>He lay down on his bed and closed his eyes. Images of Jimin\u2019s colorless skin filled his head. The boy\u2019s lips had been so cold and so dead. He didn\u2019t even look like him. Jimin used to be such a warm person. So happy even amidst his struggles. After Hoseok\u2019s accident, he\u2019d thought his life was over. He\u2019d lost all hope. But Jimin had pulled him up out of the darkness. He\u2019d been the last remaining glimmer of sunlight for Hoseok to cling to. His ray of sunlight. His little Jimin.</p><p>As he released a tired sigh, Hoseok felt a tear slip from beneath his eyelid, drawing a cold trail down his cheek. Without even realizing it, he\u2019d relied so much on Jimin. Relied on his joy, on his positivity, on the promise Jimin made on Beach Day after Hoseok had dumped his pills into the fire.</p><p><i>We\u2019ll help you through this, hyung.</i></p><p>The boy had hidden his own pain so Hoseok wouldn\u2019t see it.</p><p><i>I\u2019m rooting for you.</i></p><p>Hoseok\u2019s face twisted and he threw his arm across his eyes as the despair crashed over him. He could feel his chest tightening, his lungs seizing as his heart hammered against his ribs. Thoughts of the other boys flooded his mind. Images of Taehyung\u2019s boxy grin and lanky arms slung over Namjoon\u2019s shoulders to his bloody hands and haunted eyes. Of Jungkook\u2019s sparkling eyes and playful jabs to him lying in his hospital bed with wires and tubes sticking out of him. Of Jimin. Jimin. Sweet Jimin, golden-skinned and running on the beach to limp and lifeless, his wet, hair matted to his pale face.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t know if I can take much more.</i></p><p>Another sob clawed its way up Hoseok\u2019s throat, shaking the whole bed and he pushed his palms against his eyes. His breath was coming too fast, his thoughts pounding through his head like strikes from a sledgehammer. He\u2019d clung to that last ray of sunshine, that last hope, with white knuckled fists and then seeing Jimin there in the bathtub, watching his body being toted away by the paramedics, Hoseok felt it slip through his grasp. He could feel the light receding, feel it shrinking back like the tide. The darkness was taking over, creeping in like a slow moving poison. Taking over his mind, tinging his fingers black. His stomach was a churning mess. And at his center, a blackhole.</p><p>With one last shuddering breath, Hoseok relaxed completely. The drugs started to take affect and his heartbeat slowed, the ringing in his head, the cacophony of thoughts ebbing until nothing mattered anymore. </p><p>Nothing mattered.</p><p>He lay there in silence, his eyes still covered by his palms and just listened. Listened to his computer humming under his desk and the baseboard heater creaking as it warmed up and the little analog alarm clock on his nightstand. These sounds used to keep him awake all night, along with his racing thoughts and his sore neck. But now he didn\u2019t feel any pain. He was too exhausted to think. And the sounds became a last comfort that lulled him into a deep, endless sleep.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad985a2e4d26543fd87599c5f017cbbc/tumblr_inline_plrisuBP2L1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp0zjHYU1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>09. Love Is Not Over</b></h2><p><b>Present Day.</b></p><p>Jin slams his palms down on the hood of the truck and rests his forehead against the cold metal. \u201cJust, please, God,\u201d he utters. \u201cPlease let them all get here.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t heard from any of them since he left and only found out about Jimin and Hoseok from his parents. They didn\u2019t tell him until he returned because of course they assumed he\u2019d been in touch with his friends the whole time. Were they still his friends? After everything that happened, was there still anything between them? Were they even all still alive?</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s outburst back in March had felt like a punch to the gut. Jin had never held anything over their heads. He never thought he was better than any of them. The fact that Yoongi would say such a thing had cut him to the core. He hasn\u2019t talked to Yoongi since that night. In fact, besides updates from his dad about Tae\u2019s trial, he didn\u2019t hear about any of them while he was in Japan. Living unaware all summer, staying preoccupied with program activities while his friends were suffering at home. It makes him feel even sicker.</p><p>The ocean matches the churning in his stomach and he gulps hard, tears pricking his eyes as he glances down at his watch. Their usual meeting time has come and gone. He turns his head either way, looking down the stretch of empty beach in both directions. No one is coming.</p><p>Jin lowers his head again to rest it against the hood of his truck. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. Everything has slipped through the cracks and it\u2019s all his fault. He should have done more. He should have helped Taehyung the first time Namjoon came to him. He should have been there more for the others. For Jimin and Hoseok, Jungkook and Yoongi. For Namjoon. He knew the boy was sleeping in the gas station and he just let him.</p><p><i>What\u2019s wrong with me?</i></p><p>They were all dealing with so much crap yet somehow they still had so much fun together. They loved him, they cared about him, they laughed with him. He didn\u2019t deserve friends like them. He doesn\u2019t deserve any of what he\u2019s been given in this life. If he could, Jin would give it all away. He\u2019d trade anything to see his friends again. To hear their voices, to hold them close. But it\u2019s too late. He knows that now.</p><p>The wind whips the hair at the back of his head, blowing down the collar of his shirt, and leaving a trail of goosebumps down his back. He doesn\u2019t move even though he\u2019s freezing. He doesn\u2019t deserve to feel warmth. Not when it\u2019s his own fault that the world has grown so cold. He lifts his head, gaze falling on his red notebook, the pages fluttering. With a hard sniff, he picks it up, slamming it shut and trudges toward the shoreline. He stops at the edge, just out of reach of the tide and looks out at the water. In the distance, waves crash violently. He watches them fold into each other in a salty spray, crumbling under the weight of gravity. He feels like crumbling, himself. Maybe he could just walk in, keep going until the current sweeps him off his feet and pulls him under. He could let the sea wash him away.</p><p>Far away.</p><p>He looks down at the journal clutched tightly in his hands. A gift from his parents. They always believed in him. Always knew he\u2019d make something of himself some day. None of it matters to him anymore, though. He doesn\u2019t want to become a famous writer. He doesn\u2019t want to marry some perfect girl and have a perfect family and live a perfect life. He just wants his friends back. Nothing else matters. Not his career. Not his future. Not this stupid journal and everything it represents.</p><p>With a frustrated sigh, Jin grips the journal in one hand and draws his arm back behind his head. He\u2019s about to fling it as far out into the water as he possibly can when movement to his right catches his attention. With a jerk of his head, he locks eyes with Yoongi.</p><p>The boy freezes where he stands about ten feet from Jin\u2019s truck. He looks different. His hair is black instead of the mint green making him look even more pale than he already was. He seems smaller too, though maybe that\u2019s because he\u2019s standing next to the vast ocean.</p><p>Jin can\u2019t think of anything to say at first. Instead, he just stares, afraid that if he makes any sudden movements, the boy will disappear. But then at last, he finds his voice. \u201cYou came,\u201d he utters.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s shoulders relax and he brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s Beach Day,\u201d he replies with a shrug.</p><p>Jin nods before turning and running to him, throwing his arms around the boy. Yoongi\u2019s own arms wrap around him, squeezing him tighter than Jin thought his strength could allow. A strangled cry falls from Yoongi\u2019s mouth, muffled by Jin\u2019s sweater.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hyung,\u201d Yoongi cracks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for everything I said. I didn\u2019t mean any of it. I was drunk and pissed off and tired\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all true,\u201d Jin interrupts. \u201cI\u2019m the worst friend. I could have done more to help. I should have done more. You can blame me. I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi finally steps back, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his coat. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all screwed up.\u201d</p><p>The two don\u2019t say anything for a while, Yoongi looking down at his feet in shame and Jin just watching him because he can\u2019t believe his friend is here. His chest still feels warm where the other held onto him. It still feels like a dream that he\u2019s just waiting to wake up from.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to the others at all?\u201d Jin finally asks. He\u2019s been dreading asking the question but he has to know. \u201cHow\u2019s Jimin? How\u2019s Hoseok? Are they&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looks up at last to meet his eyes. \u201cWell, uh\u2026Hoseok\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two talking about me?\u201d</p><p>Jin spins around, the momentum swinging his arms too far and causing him to stumble as he turns to face the source of the voice. Hoseok stands there, alive and golden-skinned, Namjoon trailing a bit behind him kicking at the sand, hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cHobi?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s lips curl into a warm smile, his eyes glittering and he makes his way closer, opening his arms invitingly. Jin steps into them, not completely believing that this is real. But the boy is warm, warm as a ray of sunshine and Jin closes his eyes, feeling the calm wash over him. The last he heard, Hoseok had swallowed a bottle of pills, but here he was, in the flesh, alive. Alive and warm and solid. Jin pulls his bottom lip into his mouth and bites down against the tight feeling in his throat.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Hobi?\u201d he asks weakly then pulls back to look the boy in the eye.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s own bright eyes are brimming with tears but he smiles through them and nods. \u201cI\u2019ve been in rehab since June but yeah, I\u2019m doing better.\u201d Then he puts his hand on Jin\u2019s arm and squeezes gently. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Jin nods. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Namjoon says coming up behind Hoseok. He stayed back to give the two some time but he couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>He missed Jin too and it\u2019s apparent by the way he pulls him against him. When they part, Jin looks him up and down. He seems so much more put together than the last time he saw him. His skin looks healthier, the bags under his eyes are gone and his clothes look nice. He looks less ragged, so much more put together.</p><p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d he says to the younger boy.</p><p>Namjoon nods, his dimples becoming prominent as he smiles. \u201cI feel good.\u201d</p><p>Jin nods back then his eyes shift over the boy\u2019s shoulder, looking past him back down the beach again. He\u2019s afraid to ask where the other three are. He wants to know what happened to Jungkook, to Jimin. His dad had told him that they\u2019d won Taehyung\u2019s trial, the jury finding him not guilty by way of temporary insanity and self defense and the boy and his sister had gone to live in the country with relatives. At least he can find some comfort in knowing one of his friends is safe. But not knowing of the others\u2019 fate overshadows that greatly. Slowly, he turns back to Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJin-hyung!\u201d</p><p>Jin spins around, his eyes scanning the beach frantically for the source of the voice. At last they fall on a shape running at him. He can\u2019t quite tell who it is by the blur of tears suddenly covering his eyes but a smile spreads across his face anyway as he watches them make their way down the slope of the hill parallel to the water. And then he feels his throat close up, a sob trying to push its way out when two more figures appear at the crest and quickly start their descent. He breaks into his own run, the wind pulling the tears from the corners of his eyes, his heart hammering in his ears as he nears them. Jin barely has time to register Jungkook\u2019s beaming face before he crashes into him, gripping the boy tight as the force of the collision sends them sprawling to the ground in a tangle of limbs. He manages to choke out only the first of many apologies when the breath is knocked out of him by two more crushing bodies.</p><p>\u201cWe missed you, Jin-hyung,\u201d Taehyung yells in his ear</p><p>\u201cYou were gone for so long,\u201d Jimin adds.</p><p>It\u2019s all too much for Jin to handle and he crawls out from under them, sitting back on the sand and burying his face in his hands as he sobs. Immediately, the others\u2019 hands are on him, their cheeks pressed against his head, his shoulder, his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m s-so sorry,\u201d he chokes out and sniffs hard. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I left you all. I\u2019m so s-sorry I wasn\u2019t there when you guys needed me. I\u2019m s-so\u2014\u201d he lifts his head at last, his eyes meeting Jimin\u2019s. The boy looks different. Good different. His hair is dark, his skin golden, his brown eyes shining brightly. Jin cups the younger boy\u2019s face in his hands. His cheeks feel fuller than they have in a year. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. You\u2019re alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright, hyung,\u201d Jimin assures him with a warm smile. \u201cI\u2019m still in recovery but I\u2019m alright.\u201d</p><p>Jin turns to look at Jungkook. \u201cYou\u2019re walking,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d the youngest replies with a relieved laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve been in physical therapy all summer. Yoongi-hyung came back from Seoul to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>Jin looks back where Yoongi stands with the other two, his mouth set in an amused smile as he leans back against the truck watching them. \u201cWhat about the producing job?\u201d Jin asks him.</p><p>Yoongi shrugs. \u201cThere will be other openings. This was more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMina and I are living on my aunt\u2019s strawberry farm, hyung!\u201d Taehyung chimes in and Jin can\u2019t help but burst into laughter at the boy\u2019s boxy grin that seems to take up his whole face.</p><p>The other three join him on their backs in the sand, dissolving into laughter that\u2019s perhaps a bit more hysterical than necessary. It\u2019s hard not to be overwhelmed with everything. It\u2019s all too much and yet Jin never wants it to end.</p><p>At last the laughter dies down and a heavy silence falls over the group. Jin sits up again, his eyes locking with Yoongi\u2019s. The boy\u2019s mouth tugs up into a sad smile. He still must feel guilty. <i>It\u2019s alright,</i> Jin thinks. <i>That\u2019s all in the past and we can start fresh now.</i> <i>I\u2019ll never leave any of you again.</i></p><p>*</p><p>They spend Beach Day the way they have every year in the past. Together. </p><p>The air is chilly, the wind sharp, but Jin doesn\u2019t even feel it. Instead, warmth blooms in his chest as he watches his friends enjoy themselves and that keeps the cold away. The temperature drops as the sun sets and, as always, they build a fire on the beach by the truck. The orange flames lick at the night air, casting a warm glow on the boys\u2019 faces. They all look happy and it\u2019s the most beautiful thing Jin has ever witnessed. Sure, Beach Day must always come to an end. Sure, they\u2019ll have to get up tomorrow and face what lies ahead but they\u2019re together again. And they\u2019ll carry each other through whatever obstacles they\u2019ll face. And there will be many. Such is life.</p><p>Jin gets up from his spot between Yoongi and Jimin and brushes the sand off his jeans as he makes his way back to the truck. He opens the door and reaches in to grab his red notebook off the seat where he\u2019d set it earlier. It\u2019s so much colder out of reach of the fire and he sucks in a sharp breath through his teeth, bracing his shoulders against the chill as he carries his notebook to the front of the truck and lays it open on the hood. The moon shines bright, casting a cold glow over everything but what the fire\u2019s warmth reaches. And by this cold light, Jin flips his notebook open to the page he\u2019d been writing on earlier and uncaps his pen.</p><p><i>Let\u2019s not be like the vase shattered on the floor. Let\u2019s be stronger than the glue that takes these fractured pieces of our lives and puts them back together. Let\u2019s be the bond that never breaks.</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f8b045db3a6d222d515a10c54991bde/tumblr_inline_plriuagtyO1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp1n1zq81qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><h2><b>Epilogue: Young Forever - by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSORlND-r3SZhjW7WEt8dTA\">@dimpled-gukkie</a></b></h2><p><b>Three Years Later.</b></p><p>Jin climbs the steps of the apartment building, slowly making his way to the fourth floor. He can already hear voices seeping through the thin apartment walls and into the hallway, filling the fourth floor with the comforting voices of his best friends. Before he can even put the key in the door to his apartment, the one directly across opens. </p><p>\u201cHyung!\u201d </p><p>Jin nearly falls over as a newfound weight lands on his back, a small set of hands wrapped around his shoulders. \u201cWe missed you so much, we\u2019re starving!\u201d </p><p>Jin huffs before pulling the hands away from him and opening his door. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d His voice is teasing, the tone you use when trying to coax a child into using manners. </p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Jimin whines while smiling so wide that his eyes are basically closed, smushed by his chubby cheeks. Jin has to resist the urge to pinch them, happy to see that they are no longer hollow like they were a few years back. </p><p>He pretends to ponder his answer before \u201creluctantly\u201d sighing and swinging his door wide open. \u201cI guess I can make you something.\u201d </p><p>In reality, Jin knows that if he doesn\u2019t make food for the group, they\u2019ll most likely starve or order pizza for every meal. The rest seem to lose all brain cells when in the kitchen if the many near disasters are anything to go by. Jin distinctly remembers the time Namjoon not only burned one of his favorite pans but Jungkook also managed to get potatoes stuck to a plate and defied all laws of gravity. </p><p>\u201cJin Hyung is making dinner!\u201d Jimin yells into the hallway beckoning the rest of their friends to Jin\u2019s small apartment. The first to rush out are Taehyung and Jungkook, which is no surprise as they both never stop eating. Pausing in the doorway, Jin waits for the rest to arrive before sighing as the other two apartments on the floor remain occupied. </p><p>\u201cAre Hobi and Yoongi still working on their mixtapes?\u201d Jin asks as he begins pulling pots and pans out of the cupboards. As a college student struggling to not accumulate student loan debt, all he has to make is an unhealthy amount of ramen. Jin proceeds to pick through his numerous flavors of packaged noodles when the door opens. Before Jimin can open his mouth to answer, Yoongi enters. </p><p>\u201cWow, Jin hyung. Look at you, you\u2019re a true college student.\u201d Jungkook snickers nearly earning him a whack on the back of the head. </p><p>\u201cYah! You should be nice to the one who\u2019s making you food.\u201d Jin chides before pouring water into the pot. He can hear Jimin softly scolding Jungkook to be nicer to his hyung and smiles. Jiminie has always been such a sweetheart. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the mixtape going?\u201d Jin asks Yoongi while filling the pot with water. He glances in Yoongi\u2019s direction while turning off the faucet to make sure that the boy is actually taking care of himself. Yoongi had a habit of throwing his health aside for his music, but hopefully with Hoseok working alongside him, he will take care of himself.</p><p>To Jin\u2019s relief no dark under-eye circles contrast Yoongi\u2019s pale skin, a result of not venturing outside for five years. Yoongi only begins to answer when Jin is once again facing the stove. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s where I want it to be though. It feels incomplete.\u201d The maknaes fall silent listening to their hyung\u2019s worry, not sure exactly how to help since they have no knowledge of music composition. </p><p>\u201cHave you had Hobi listen to it yet?\u201d Jin asks pouring salt into the pot of water and turning on the stove. The faster he can get the water boiling, the faster he can cook the noodles, which means the faster they can eat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not quite sure either though. We just spent two hours listening to the tracks on repeat to try and see what\u2019s off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe you need another voice on your track, hyung? I would gladly volunteer.\u201d Taehyung smiles. Ever since Hoseok and Yoongi created Cypher Records, Taehyung who\u2019s their biggest fan, has been asking to be on a song every time it\u2019s brought up. Secretly, the duo have planned a song out just for Taehyung to feature on, but it\u2019s a gift for his birthday. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought about asking Namjoon hyung?\u201d Jungkook pipes up, munching on dry ramen. They all turn to face him, giving him questioning stares at his choice of a snack. He shrugs. </p><p>\u201cI guess I could ask Namjoon. Maybe having someone not directly involved in composition would help.\u201d </p><p>Jungkook smiles wide, bunny grin on display from the pride of helping a hyung. A few years ago, after Hoseok and Yoongi had begun creating their record label, Namjoon quit his janitorial job in favor of running the business side of the label. Since he\u2019s the only member of the group who\u2019s held a real job, Yoongi and Hoseok thought that he would be best. Namjoon ran everything from promotions to contracts and anything in between. He was the one running the hustle, meanwhile Yoongi and Hoseok were the face of the company. Although some may hate being only known in the background, Namjoon is happiest there. </p><p>Namjoon and Hoseok enter at last, the final two of the group of seven. The boys cheer when they enter and pull two chairs over. They all sit huddled together in silence, the sound of boiling water filling the room. It\u2019s a comfortable silence. The type you get after being with someone for so long, and Jin feels himself relax after a long day of classes. That is until Jungkook starts munching on another dry ramen packet. </p><p>\u201cYah! Can you just wait?\u201d Jin yells exasperatedly. Jungkook pouts in response before slowly putting it down on the counter. </p><p>\u201cHe eats all the time, hyung. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised.\u201d Jimin says, ruffling Jungkook\u2019s hair affectionately. </p><p>\u201cYeah, ever since he started playing intramural sports he\u2019s always hungry.\u201d Tae laughs before taking a bite of the dry ramen. \u201cYuck! How are you eating this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Jungkook mumbles. \u201cI gotta feed these muscles.\u201d Flexing his bicep, he gives it a slap for extra measure causing the boys to fall in a fit of giggles.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah put your muscles away, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d Tae says. While Jungkook focused on becoming a muscle man, Taehyung has been more focused on eating the delicacies of life. Because of his new affinity for food, Tae and Jin have developed a stronger bond through their love of trying new dishes. Although, Taehyung does make sure to eat a handful of strawberries a day; they remind him of his days with his aunt and sister on the strawberry farm after the trial. </p><p>\u201cAlright, children, dinner is ready,\u201d \u00a0Jin says pulling dishes down from the cabinet. One by one, the boys pile noodles into their bowls before settling around the living room. There\u2019s only a small table in the kitchen that seats four, so they sit in a circle sprawled across the floor and couch. They\u2019re all silent, focusing only on eating after a long day of classes and work, until Jungkook starts slurping the remnants in his bowl. </p><p>\u201cDid we adopt a toddler?\u201d Jin remarks. </p><p>\u201cWe adopted two.\u201d Namjoon pinches Jimin\u2019s cheek that\u2019s stuffed with noodles. Jimin\u2019s eyes go wide and a blush paints itself across his cheeks as he turns his gaze away. </p><p>\u201cI think if we\u2019re being honest, we\u2019re all just overgrown toddlers,\u201d Yoongi adds. </p><p>The boys all scoff and he rolls his eyes. Yoongi likes to think he\u2019s an adult. That he\u2019s finally outgrown his childish fears and that he\u2019s become more mature. But when he sits among his group of friends he still feels like he\u2019s a teen, mind filled with wonder and the feeling that nothing\u2019s impossible. It feels like everyday is Beach Day with the boys by his side. Like he\u2019ll never have to be alone like he was back in Seoul. </p><p>\u201cThat would explain why I saw Jin throw his psychology textbook across the room yesterday and throw a tantrum,\u201d Hoseok says. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand! I have to memorize all the Psychosocial Stages. There\u2019s too many to remember,\u201d Jin whines, glaring at the textbook lying on the coffee table. </p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about going back to creative writing? I feel like you were happier then,\u201d Hoseok responds. </p><p>\u201cNo, I like psychology. It\u2019s just a much harder subject. I think with psych I\u2019ll be able to actually help people. I can save them from what you all went through. I can almost make up for not being there.\u201d The boys fall silent, each face more stoic than the next. Jin rubs his hands together nervously. </p><p>\u201cWe forgave you a long time ago. You don\u2019t need to do this to pay us back.\u201d Namjoon reaches over to give a comforting squeeze on Jin\u2019s arm. </p><p>\u201cI-I know. I want to do this, though. Besides, if you ever do need me again, I\u2019ll be able to help.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell we appreciate it, hyung.\u201d Hoseok smiles. \u201cOn a less serious note, I\u2019ve rented my mom\u2019s old studio. I was thinking of holding dance lessons when I\u2019m not helping Yoongi hyung in the studio.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them!\u201d Jimin yells. Ever since getting into college, Jimin has been trying to bulk himself up. He wants to be able to defend himself and not have to rely on Jungkook and Taehyung to save him. He doesn\u2019t want to have guard dogs anymore; he just wants them to be his friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them too!\u201d Taehyung yells from the kitchen, digging around the fridge for the carton of strawberries he keeps hidden. </p><p>\u201cHow about we all take them? Hobi can get some practice in teaching unskilled students and we can learn how to dance. I\u2019d like to not look like the inflatable long-limbed man outside of car dealerships.\u201d Namjoon chuckles. </p><p>\u201cBold of you to assume I don\u2019t know how to dance,\u201d Jin says. </p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Namjoon retorts. </p><p>\u201cNot the point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell if we\u2019re mentioning new stuff we\u2019re doing, I\u2019ve decided to get into photography,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cI\u2019d like to capture the good moments of my life so I can forget the bad.\u201d \t</p><p>Jungkook looks at Taehyung before quietly saying, \u201cstill getting the nightmares?\u201d </p><p>Taehyung nods. \u201cThey\u2019re not as frequent but every now and then I get them. They just stay with me a while. I think surrounding myself with physical copies of happy memories would help in keeping them from plaguing my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take one right now?\u201d Jimin suggests and Tae nods enthusiastically before dashing towards his apartment. </p><p>When he returns, a large camera is in his hand and he sets it on top of Jin\u2019s psychology textbook. It\u2019s so thick that it puts the camera at least two inches above the coffee table. </p><p>After about two minutes of Taehyung yelling: \u201cmove left, no my left!\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re too far, you\u2019re only half a body now\u201d, \u201cJimin you can\u2019t sit in the back no one can see you\u201d, everyone fits the frame. Setting on the self timer, Taehyung launches himself across the laps of Jimin, Hoseok, and Yoongi who\u2019re all sitting in front since they\u2019re the smallest. They let out small huffs but still hug Taehyung to their bodies. The flash goes off and they all clamber back towards the camera to see the photo. </p><p>Thankfully, each boy is in frame and no one was accidentally decapitated. Staring at the photo, with the boys wrapped together in a tight hug, Jin feels warm. This right here is his family. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s not by blood or that they split apart at one moment, because Jin knows they\u2019ll always fall back together. They\u2019re like magnets, no matter how far they pull away, they\u2019ll always reconnect eventually.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"208\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ce66b521ba7c779ff02ec2ad756876a/tumblr_inline_plriy8h5v01qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"208\"/></figure>",

Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment In Life</b></h2><p>Jin stands on the beach, arms resting on the hood of his truck as he stares out at the ocean. The bitter wind whips his hair in his eyes and fills his head with the smells of salt and seaweed. You\u2019d never know it\u2019s the end of \u00a0summer. The sky is an anemic gray, the water dull and choppy. Its chaotic churning matches the whirlwind in his stomach. His fingers shake and he can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from the cold or the anxiety that seems to pulse through him like a live wire.</p><p>He\u2019s been gone all summer, doing a program abroad in Japan and he\u2019s supposed to start his third year of university in just a couple weeks. But here he is on the beach because they always meet up here. It\u2019s tradition. Every summer they mourn/celebrate the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. They spend the day at the beach, goofing off, having a big bonfire and staying out all night. It\u2019s always been like this. All seven of them, together every year. Even though they hang out all season, the annual end of summer beach day seems almost like a reunion of sorts.</p><p>But after everything that happened\u2026will any of them even show up? Jin feels the blood drain from his face as the terrible thought he\u2019s been trying to avoid suddenly appears in his mind. Will anyone <i>not</i> show up?</p><p>With a quick clench of his fists, he pushes off his truck and runs his hands through his hair. He\u2019s been absent this summer, even before then he was going to school full-time and was really only able to see his friends on the weekends and some holidays. And with how little he saw them, they all seemed worse every time he came around. There was nothing subtle about the change in each of their lives. And nothing he could do to help them. He watched each of them slip further and there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>There was nothing he could do.</p><p>With each passing week, the gap between he and the others grew and before too long, he felt like an outsider, a fly on the wall observing rather than being a part of it. And then that whole thing with Yoongi. With Tae and his dad. And Jungkook and Jimin\u2026and Hoseok\u2026</p><p>He sucks in a sharp breath, his heart clenching like a cold fist in his ribcage as he stumbles to the cab of his truck and throws the door open. He rummages for a few seconds through the food wrappers and trash on the floor on the passenger side before finding his red notebook. Then he slams the door shut again, drops the journal open on the hood and begins to write.</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>Do you remember how it used to be? How we fit like a seven piece puzzle? Chaotic and messy on our own but a perfect picture when we were together\u2026</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e1e64d5e71c4589422ce26aed1d979e/tumblr_inline_plrieo6tIs1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp3xbm2p1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>02. Hold Me Tight</b></h2><p><i>We were nothing until we became something. And we were only something when we were with each other.</i></p><p><b>One Year Ago.</b></p><p>Kim Seokjin sat in the bed of his truck, back against the cab, his red journal propped up on his legs as he scratched his pen across the lined paper. He\u2019d always loved writing. It was why he\u2019d decided to become an english major. This notebook had been a gift from his parents, inexpensive but meaningful. A symbol of their support of him pursuing a passion with little promise of fame or fortune. He didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s what he loved.</p><p>Every so often, he lifted his eyes from the page and stared out at the ocean. At the expanse of sea, glittering in the sunlight. Beach day was always his favorite day. Sure, it signaled the end of the summer, and the air, though still warm, carried the faintest bite of autumn, but it was a day for him to spend with his six best friends. The ones that he\u2019d shared his life with for the past five years. Sure, his friendship with them looked different now than it did back then. Life had been a harsh beast, threatening many times to rip them apart but they always prevailed and their bond had become stronger every time because of it.</p><p>\u201cJin-hyung!\u201d</p><p>Jin tore his eyes from the water to look further down the beach and a smile spread across his face when he saw two obscured figures making their way toward him. One tall and lanky, the other shrouded in a black hoodie. Namjoon and Taehyung.</p><p>He climbed out of the bed of his truck and tensed his body as the two younger boys reached him and lunged, each throwing their arms around him and causing him to stumble back.</p><p>\u201cYah!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019d think we haven\u2019t seen each other in a decade.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung smiled, his mouth shaping into a rectangular grin that the rest of the boys had come to love. \u201cAnother year, another Beach Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019re off to school again tomorrow,\u201d Namjoon added mussing up the older boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>Jin ducked out from beneath his arm and patted his hair back into place. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m moving across the country. I\u2019ll still be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch less though,\u201d Taehyung said. \u00a0Jin\u2019s eyes lingered on the ugly purple bruise blooming around the boy\u2019s left eye, at the cut on his lip that split open when he had smiled. With a quick swipe of his sleeve, Taehyung wiped the blood away that had welled up. How many stains were hidden by the dark fabric of his black hoodie?</p><p>The three of them heard more shouts and laughter and turned to find their other four friends running toward them, hair and clothes whipping in the harsh wind. A few more yards and the seven of them were together again, as it should be. As it always should be.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah\u201d Taehyung yelled to the youngest boy as he flung his arms around him. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother!\u201d Jungkook yelled back and dramatically threw his body against him in a crushing hug. \u201cWhere have you been all my life?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked again to Jin. \u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cJungkook-ah gets it.\u201d</p><p>Jin could only laugh as he watched the hug turn into a power struggle in the sand. The wrestling match quickly became a dog pile as Jimin, the third youngest, jumped on top, followed by Hoseok and finally the second oldest, Yoongi. Namjoon, more of a lover than a fighter, stood back with Jin, arms folded across his chest as he looked fondly down at their friends.</p><p>They spent the day together there on the empty beach. Seven friends drawing messages in the sand, racing each other along the shore, eating junk, wrestling and laughing, their normal lives forgotten, washed away by the crashing waves. By the time the sun was setting, their throats hurt from screaming, their limbs ached, their eyes burned but it was the happiest they\u2019d been all year. It was a day to forget the present and live in the good times of the past and the possibilities of the future.</p><p>It grew dark. Not pitch dark. A bright darkness that made the sky a cobalt blue and everything else a crisp black. All they could smell was the tang of sea salt, all they could hear was the breaking of waves as they all lay in the sand and looked up at the stars. The world seems to spin a bit slower at night. The temperature had plunged when the sun set and when they finally couldn\u2019t stand the cold anymore, they built a bonfire right there on the beach.</p><p>For hours the seven of them joked around, brought up funny memories, burst into song and played games, the punishment always the same, taking a dip in the frigid ocean. Before long, all of them were damp, their hair plastered to their foreheads in wet, salty strands. At last, sleepiness began to settle over the group, sending them all into silence. No one wanted to acknowledge that Beach Day was coming to a close. Everyone dreaded returning to the real world the next day.</p><p>After several minutes of silence passed, Hoseok finally sucked in a sharp breath and got to his feet. \u201cI brought something,\u201d he said digging into his pocket. When he pulled his hand back out, it was wrapped around a plastic baggie of pills. The rest of the group watched with bated breath. \u201cI feel like this is a good moment to start over,\u201d he said as he watched the flames lick at the cold air. \u201cAnd what\u2019s a better way to start over than getting rid of the temptation entirely, right?\u201d His eyes lifted to peer around the circle. The others nodded, a few of them giving him small smiles of cautious encouragement. The boy had been struggling with addiction for years. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d decided to quit cold-turkey. But they all clung to the hope that it was the last.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help you through this, hyung,\u201d Jimin said with a determined nod. Hoseok smiled back, his eyes glittering at the promise.</p><p>Then with his own definitive nod, he opened the baggie and turned it upside down over the fire. The others cheered as his smile became wider. At last he stuffed the empty bag back in his pocket and fell back down into the sand. Yoongi clapped him hard on the back and Jimin leaned into him, nuzzling his side until he lifted his arm and slung it over the younger\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Jin smiled from where he leaned against the tailgate of his truck, his eyes scanning his circle of friends. The next morning he was heading off to college. Sure, his dorm wasn\u2019t far and he planned on coming home on the weekends but\u2026</p><p>His eyes flew to the dark bruise on Taehyung\u2019s face, to the pale, sallowness of Jimin\u2019s cheeks, to the threadbare places on Namjoon\u2019s old clothes, to the dark stress circles under Yoongi\u2019s eyes, to Jungkook wearing Yoongi\u2019s sweatshirt providing him the comfort he doesn\u2019t often receive at home</p><p>\u2026he couldn\u2019t help but worry about them. They had a much rougher life than he did and though he did what he could to help, he was afraid that life was getting the best of them. And there was only so much he could do to try and keep their heads above water before he too might sink and they all would drown.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b01174d4d534042dd630624274c053fe/tumblr_inline_plrii1jMao1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrovgkPsj1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>03. Autumn Leaves</b></h2><p><i>Apart, we were fragmented but together, we were unbreakable. And that was all we needed. Until it wasn\u2019t.</i></p><p><b>November.</b><br></p><p>School had always been hard for Park Jimin. Luckily, the fact that Jungkook and Taehyung were almost constantly by his side made it bearable. They were his best friends and protectors against those that liked to pick on him because of how small he was. It wasn\u2019t his fault that when the other boys hit puberty, they sprung up like weeds while he stayed closer to the ground. Though the taunting, the name calling, the abuse, made it feel to him like it was his fault. Like he should have tried harder, thought bigger, been stronger.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to feel good enough when the world tells you that you never will be. Even the medication didn\u2019t help much. The constant taunting throughout the years had worn him down. Chipped away at his meager self-confidence until there was nothing left to help but a razor blade and a bottle of sleeping pills. That didn\u2019t work. And after he\u2019d gotten out of the hospital and gone through treatment and promised his parents he\u2019d continue going to therapy and taking his anti-depressants, he turned to the one thing he wasn\u2019t too weak to control. Food. Everyone else already thought he was small. Maybe if he made himself small enough, he could just disappear entirely. If nothing else, the smaller the target, the harder it is to hit.</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook and Taehyung were like his fortress walls. Taehyung already dealt with his alcoholic father so fighting off a few bullies at school was nothing to him, and the stress of being in foster care had driven Jungkook to the school\u2019s weight room and onto the field so just his appearance was intimidating enough to keep others away. \u00a0There were still the whispers though. They\u2019d seep into Jimin\u2019s head, constantly reminding him that if anyone ever found the chink in his armor, he was done for. Living in constant fear was exhausting.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s parents had gone to the principal about it but he said nothing could be done if it wasn\u2019t happening on school grounds. And of course, bullies are smart. They\u2019d taunt him in the halls and then wait in the shadows to pounce. They\u2019d only gotten to him once before, a day that Taehyung was in the hospital with a broken arm and Jungkook had to stay after for detention, and after that, his parents started picking him up. They\u2019d talked of homeschooling him but couldn\u2019t make it work. But Jimin assured them, as long as he had Taehyung and Jungkook, he\u2019d be okay.</p><p>And so the three of them were a unit. You rarely saw one without the other two. They\u2019d worked it out with the principal for at least one of them to be in every class with him. It had been that way since middle school. Now here they were their senior year. It was nearing the end of November now with no incidences so far. Only seven more months to graduation. \u00a0Jimin could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to the guidance counselor about your dad?\u201d Jimin asked Taehyung as they sat together in the cafeteria. The taller boy had come to school that morning sporting a new blackening bruise on his cheekbone.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head and stuffed a piece of broccoli into his mouth. \u201cYou saw what the principal did about your situation. You think a teacher is going to be able to do anything about mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could always come home with you one day,\u201d Jungkook said as he sat down in front of his tray. \u201cThe two of us could give him a taste of his own medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Taehyung uttered. \u201cIt\u2019s better not to provoke him. He doesn\u2019t get like this very often. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Jimin and Jungkook exchanged knowing glances. \u201cNot very often\u201d had turned into Taehyung sporting a new cut or bruise every week. It was getting worse and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay at my house tonight,\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head and pushed a pea around his tray with the tines of his fork. \u201cNo, Mina is going to be home tonight and it\u2019s best if I\u2019m there too. You know, to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jungkook cut him off.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s younger sister spent most nights at her friends\u2019 houses, luckily she was popular and had a lot of friends to be able to do this with. But on those nights where she was home, Taehyung always made sure to be there, just in case their dad decided to drink. Jimin remembered Taehyung staying at his house one night back in middle school and the next day at school seeing Mina with a black eye. His friend swore to never leave her home alone again after that and he\u2019d kept that promise.</p><p>\u201cBetter eat your vegetables so you can grow big and strong.\u201d Jimin looked up to see Jiho and a few of his friends sitting at the table across the aisle. The guy hadn\u2019t gone one day without tormenting him since sixth grade.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think midgets can grow big and strong,\u201d his friend, Kijung, retorted from beside him.</p><p>The rest of the table laughed while Jiho stared directly into Jimin\u2019s eyes, a vicious smirk on his lips.</p><p>Jimin quickly looked away again, a shudder running down his spine. \u201cDid either of you finish your calculus homework from last night?\u201d he asked as he grabbed his backpack off the bench next to him and began digging into it.</p><p>Jungkook and Taehyung ripped their eyes away from the other table and locked on each other, forks hovering just outside their mouths. Of course they didn\u2019t do it. With a roll of his own eyes, Jimin pulled out his text book and opened it to the assigned pages. He\u2019d been using his homework as a bookmark and now laid it on the table for the two to see. He ran a hand through his newly dyed orange hair as Jungkook and Taehyung fumbled with their own backpacks and searched for their notebooks so they could copy down his work.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would you do without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably fail math,\u201d Jungkook uttered and pulled the smaller boy\u2019s homework closer to him so he could hastily scribble down the answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the brains, you got the brawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I get?\u201d Taehyung asked looking up with his mouth full of rice.</p><p>Jimin looked down at his barely touched tray of food, over to Jungkook\u2019s somewhat normal sized lunch and then to Taehyung\u2019s tray piled high with everything on the line. He smiled fondly. \u201cThe appetite,\u201d he finally said before picking up a piece of melon and nibbling off a corner.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to stay over tonight?\u201d Jungkook asked Taehyung as the three of them made their way out of the school.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll call you if anything changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I used up my minutes for this month and Fake Dad refuses to buy me more.\u201d He always referred to his foster family as his fake family. Fake Mom, Fake Dad, Fake Brother 1, Fake Brother 2\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m hanging out with Yoongi-hyung though after this so just call him if you need to reach me.\u201d Then he brought up a hand to shield his eyes from the sun. \u201cJimin-ah, isn\u2019t your mom picking you up today?\u201d Jungkook asked, his eyes scanning the row of cars that were idling on the curb.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s own head moved along before his gaze settled on a dull, yellow hatchback. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Thursday,\u201d he said and lifted an arm to wave at the driver. \u201cHobi-hyung and I have group therapy.\u201d</p><p>An arm stuck up from the opposite side, hanging out the driver\u2019s side window and Jimin hitched his backpack higher on his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow,\u201d he said to his friends before jogging over to Hoseok\u2019s car and slipping into the passenger seat. Then with a horrible grinding sound of metal on metal and a shudder, the car pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, hyung?\u201d Jimin asked as he positioned his backpack on the floor between his feet.</p><p>\u201cJust fine, kid,\u201d Hoseok replied gripping the wheel with white knuckles.</p><p>It had been a few months now since Beach Day when the other six had witnessed him dump his pills into the bonfire, but even now he looked like he was feeling the lingering effects of withdrawal. Dark circles stained the skin under his eyes and his complexion looked pallid. Not at all the usual golden color. The boy who was normally a perfect depiction of sunshine, had become overcast. He looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping at night?\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>Hoseok glanced at himself in his rearview mirror and immediately straightened up. As if he could hide what Jimin had already picked up on. \u201cA bit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Obviously the boy didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Jimin had told him he\u2019d be there to help in any way that he could but how could he if Hoseok refused to let him?</p><p>The two had been friends for five years but really bonded in the hospital while Jimin was recovering from his suicide attempt and Hoseok was going through his latest bout of rehab. They\u2019d connected immediately, both lost souls having been seeking comfort in the wrong things. Going to group therapy together and encouraging each other in their battles with their demons had brought them closer together. And then when they both had finished inpatient treatment, they stayed close. Sure, Jimin had Jungkook and Taehyung but he\u2019d always have a special connection with Hoseok. He was the older brother Jimin had always needed. It was hard seeing his hyung struggling so much. He hated when any of his friends were hurting. None of them deserved it.</p><p>With his lip caught between his teeth, he pulled his phone out of the side pocket of his backpack, opening a text conversation with Yoongi.</p><p><b>Party at ur place tmrrw? Hobi needs us</b></p><p><b>Yoongi: Sounds good. Spread the word</b></p><p><b>thnks hyung</b></p><p><b>Yoongi: Np</b></p><p>*</p><p>After group therapy, Hoseok brought Jimin back to his house, pulling up to the curb and putting it in park. The two sat in silence for several seconds as the engine idled, Jimin chewing on the inside of his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIs it true, hyung?\u201d he finally asked quietly. \u201cIs the pain really back?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok drummed this thumbs against the steering wheel, his eyes glued to the dash. His pale lips pressed into a thin line and he gave a sharp nod. He looked ragged. More so than Jimin had seen him in a long time. Or maybe he just hadn\u2019t noticed. Hadn\u2019t noticed the stress lines creasing his young face. Or the way his mouth turned down. Or how his shoulders slumped forward as if his struggles were literally crushing him under their weight. Jimin felt the guilt like a fist grab his stomach and twist hard.</p><p>When they\u2019d first met, Hoseok was an incredible dancer. The guys had all gone to a couple of his shows and even as a high schooler, his moves had been impressive. Jimin always loved the idea of dancing but felt it would just be another thing to add to the long list of things he was bullied for. The last thing Jiho needed was more material.</p><p>And then, one night during rehearsal, Hoseok had tripped backward off the stage, falling several feet to the auditorium floor and landing on his neck. He\u2019d suffered a pretty bad spinal injury and the doctors weren\u2019t even sure if he\u2019d ever be able to walk again. Luckily, he regained his ability over the course of a few weeks, but the pain lingered in his neck and spine. He began to rely on pills to help but he kept taking them even after the pain finally subsided. The guys had gotten used to him being high. In fact, if he wasn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t Hoseok. He was a zombie, a shell, lifeless and hollow. But with the pills, he was full of energy, down for anything. Fun.</p><p>After throwing the pills in the fire during Beach Day, he\u2019d gone through the initial withdrawal period. Every time Jimin saw him, he looked like death, but as time went on, he began to resemble the Hoseok they knew before all of this. The one that could be happy and hyper without the high. But maybe it had been an act. An exhausting act, but one nonetheless. And now the pain was back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go back to the pills again, are you, hyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be disappointed in me?\u201d Hoseok asked, finally looking over at him. The sadness in his eyes said it all. He\u2019d been fighting hard, suffering in silence for several months and now he looked ready to give it all up.</p><p>Jimin lifted his hand and put it over the older boy\u2019s where they rested on the steering wheel. His fists were clenched so tight, they felt like steel under Jimin\u2019s own soft palm.</p><p>\u201cI would never be disappointed in you, hyung,\u201d he replied, keeping his voice steady and strong so Hoseok knew he meant every word. \u201cYou could completely relapse and I\u2019d never be disappointed in you. Recovery is hard. Addiction is hard. We have bad days and we have worse days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days are unbearable,\u201d Hoseok whispered. \u201cI know our therapist says to take it a day at a time but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget what the therapist said,\u201d Jimin interrupted. \u201cIf taking it a day at a time is too much, then take it an hour at a time. Or a minute or a second. As long as you make an effort, you\u2019re winning, hyung. And we\u2019re all rooting for you. I\u2019m rooting for you.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s grip on the steering wheel loosened under Jimin\u2019s hand and the boy looked at him. A spark flashed through his tired eyes. Something like determination. A newfound desire to keep going. \u201cThanks, Jimin,\u201d he uttered and gave him a weak smile before looking away and sniffing hard.</p><p>Jimin gave the older boy\u2019s hands a quick squeeze before pulling his own back and snatching his phone up out of his lap. His fingers danced across the screen as he typed.</p><p><b>party tonite?</b></p><p><b>\u2026</b></p><p><b>JK: alredy here</b></p><p><b>T: Mina\u2019s gone. i\u2019m down</b></p><p><b>NJ: see u then</b></p><p><b>Y: </b>\ud83d\udc4d</p><p><b>J: Leaving now.</b></p><p>Hoseok glanced down at his phone where it rested in the cupholder, the screen lit up with the group message. Jimin\u2019s breath hitched when he saw the corners of the boy\u2019s mouth twitch upward then he watched as Hoseok shifted the car back out of park and glanced over his shoulder to check for other cars.</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2019s?\u201d he asked.</p><p>With a smile, Jimin unlocked his phone again so he could let his mom know he would be home later. She sent back a thumbs up and a heart as they turned at the end of the street and headed toward Yoongi\u2019s place.</p><p>*</p><p>The second oldest of the group lived in a cluster of train cars in a yard near the river. He\u2019d made a sort of deal with the owner a while back that he\u2019d help maintain the place in exchange for somewhere to live. As long as he didn\u2019t bring shady people around or do anything illegal, the owner didn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>This was where the seven friends congregated. It was their home away from home\u2014for some even more home than their own. A place any of the six could go and they would never be turned away.</p><p>The night descended into chaos much like it regularly did. It always started out tame enough. A few of the guys\u2014usually the youngest three\u2014would crowd around the small tv that sat on Yoongi\u2019s coffee table, playing old Atari games, while a few of the others would just talk in the kitchen area, hunched over a pizza box. The older four being of legal drinking (and purchasing) age each usually supplied some type of alcohol and would experiment with mixing them. It would pretty much go downhill from there.</p><p>This night was no different. At one point, Jimin was jumping up and down on the couch with Taehyung, the two screaming the lyrics to the techno-y song filling the room when he was smashed in the chest with a pillow. Feathers exploded into the air and he sprawled off the couch and onto the plywood floor, his fuzzy head swimming even faster as he looked around dazedly for the source of the assault. At last, his eyes focused on Hoseok\u2019s beaming face and he narrowed his own at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on, hyung,\u201d he growled before grabbing a cushion off the couch and swinging it up hard.</p><p>Suddenly, the rest of the boys joined, grabbing whatever stuffed object they could find and before long, the place looked like a plushie and feather factory had exploded. Cotton and feathers covered every surface and the boys were rolling in fits of howling laughter. Jimin felt higher than a kite even as he lay among the feathers and fluff, Hoseok laying on his arm.</p><p>But once the laughter died down, a heavy silence fell over the place and within minutes, most of the guys were passed out drunk where they\u2019d landed. Jimin, however, pulled his arm out from under Hoseok and sat up on his haunches. He swayed with sleep, fighting it hard. He needed to go home. The other boys were in situations where their absence probably wouldn\u2019t even be noticed. Even Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2014out on dates most nights ever since her divorce from his father\u2014probably wasn\u2019t wondering where he was. But Jimin\u2019s parents were different. With his past and his problems and the bullying, they had come to worry a lot more easily about him. They always trusted he was safe when he was with the guys but if they expected him home, he had better come home.</p><p>He could have texted. He could have called and his mom or dad would have come and picked him up, no questions asked. But instead, he decided he\u2019d rather not bother anyone and make the short trek home.</p><p>It was a stupid idea. It was stupid. It was stupid and he knew it in his gut but his head was too numb to realize just how stupid and so he wobbled to his feet, stood there for a second to regain his balance and then slipped out the door and into the frigid night, alone.</p><p>*</p><p>He would have been fine had he stayed on the sidewalk. Just kept walking and not stopping until he was safe inside his house. But as he walked past the minute mart two blocks from home, his head lifted and his eyes locked on a rack of chips through the window. He had eaten barely anything all day and they sounded so good and he found himself veering off the path and pushing his way through the glass door, inside.</p><p>He may have even been fine if he\u2019d just grabbed the chips, paid for them and left. Even if he\u2019d tripped on the welcome mat once he was inside, <i>or</i> fumbled with his wallet for a few seconds, <i>or</i> dropped a bill while he was trying to stuff his change back into it, he would have been okay. But the fact that he did all of those things instead of just one, meant that a car was pulling up to the curb just as he was exiting the store. Just a few seconds longer and he would have been hidden again by the shadows and the occupants of the car wouldn\u2019t have even glanced his way.</p><p>But instead, he stumbled out the door, the driver\u2019s eyes immediately catching the movement, and his lips twisted into a malicious grin as he set his sights on Jimin.</p><p>\u201cWhere you goin, midget?\u201d</p><p>Jimin\u2019s blood turned cold at the familiar voice and suddenly it was as if the alcohol vanished from his system. He turned slowly, his mind no longer sluggish, but racing. And when he saw that three others were climbing out of the car along with Jiho, his stomach twisted and he felt bile rising in his throat.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Jiho,\u201d he cracked and swallowed hard.</p><p>The bigger boy laughed and folded his arms over his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t see your guard dogs anywhere,\u201d he said and made a point to look around. \u201cGetting a little brave, are we?\u201d</p><p>Jimin didn\u2019t waste another second to respond. Instead, he twisted around and took off running down the sidewalk. His heart pounded in time with his sprinting footsteps and staggered when the sound of his pursuers reached his ears. His breath became ragged in his throat and his body tingled with fear. He reached the end of the block and whipped around the corner, his shoes skidding on the sidewalk and he almost lost balance but regained it quickly, using his hands to push himself back up. There was an alley just a few yards ahead and beyond that, he could see his house. He was almost there. Relief flooded his body as his eyes locked on his front porch.</p><p>And then he felt a hand grab his hood and tug hard.</p><p>Jimin flew backward, a cry ripping from his throat as his body hit the pavement. And then more hands were on him, yanking him back up and shoving him into the dark alley.</p><p>*</p><p>Jimin finally found the strength to pick himself up almost twenty minutes after Jiho and his friends left him there in the alley. His whole body trembled and he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He didn\u2019t know if that was from the multiple kicks to the chest or if he was in the middle of a panic attack. Either way, he fought for air for what felt like an eternity before finally being able to breathe normally. After making his way slowly back to his house, he unlocked the door and nearly fell into the entryway when he twisted the knob while still leaning against it for support.</p><p>The house was quiet and dark and surely, his parents were in bed. He didn\u2019t want to wake them. He didn\u2019t want to spend any time assessing the damage done by Jiho and his lackeys. He just wanted to sleep. So, he crawled in pain up the stairs on his hands and knees, down the hallway and then climbed into bed with his torn clothes and shoes\u2014shoe? When did he lose the other one?\u2014praying he didn\u2019t die of internal bleeding or a concussion in the night.</p><p>*</p><p>When he woke the next morning, he stiffly shuffled into the bathroom to finally see how he looked. Awful. That\u2019s how. His bottom lip was swollen on one side, a deep cut slicing through it and down into his chin. There was blood crusted below his nose and several cuts and scrapes on his face. One eye was swollen practically shut, the skin around it a sickly green color. He had a big slice on one ear and bruises resembling fingerprints on his neck. His ribs ached and it hurt to breathe and when he lifted his shirt, he found his chest and stomach stained purple and black.</p><p>There was no way he could go to school like this. So he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He texted his mom from his room, telling her he felt extremely sick and couldn\u2019t get out of bed. She offered to stay home from work to take care of him but he insisted she leave. And his dad had left that morning for a week-long business trip. He was safe. Surely, over the weekend, most of the bruises and cuts would heal enough that they wouldn\u2019t be too noticeable come Monday. He\u2019d just have to avoid his mom. He texted Taehyung and Jungkook that he\u2019d gotten sick and would see them on Monday. He could put this whole thing behind him. Hopefully. He just needed to be more careful from now on.</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s nostrils flared, and the line of his jaw became prominent. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he snarled, his eyes roving over the students in the hallway as he searched for Jiho.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, no,\u201d Jimin said softly and he brought a hand up to rest on the trembling boy\u2019s arm.</p><p>Even though it was now Monday, the slice on his mouth hadn\u2019t healed as much as he\u2019d hoped. His eye was no longer swollen but was surrounded by a fading yellowish bruise. He looked better though. Good enough that he could hide it from his mom by wearing a hat and some makeup and keeping his head down.</p><p>At his touch, Jungkook immediately loosened, his face smoothing over again and he met Jimin\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy did you go back home alone after the party? Why didn\u2019t you wake me up? Or Tae? Or any of us? We would have gone with you.\u201d</p><p>Jimin raked his teeth over his bottom lip, wincing when he felt a sharp sting. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was stupid. I wasn\u2019t thinking. I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid, Jimin,\u201d Taehyung said quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say something like that.\u201d</p><p>Jimin nodded. He couldn\u2019t believe it though. He\u2019d done an incredibly idiotic thing going out alone like that. Of course, something bad would happen if he did something so careless. He deserved it. Of that, he was positive.</p><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5387390292888c67ed81d701ce8f7f91/tumblr_inline_plrijyKlN81qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrovxqrpf1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>04. Run</b></h2><p><i>Life began to get to each of us.</i></p><p><b>January.</b></p><p>December came like a quick intake of breath and went like a heavy sigh. Once the cozy feeling of the holidays was over, winter became harsh and merciless. An icy fist that squeezed and squeezed until there was no warmth left. Taehyung was used to it though. He\u2019d never liked winter. Not since his mom had died just after Christmas his fifth year. Mina had been too young to remember her, being only three years old, but Taehyung could remember her perfectly still, as if he\u2019d talked to her just the day before.</p><p>He and his sister used to stay up late a lot\u2014at least whenever they were both home\u2014curled up on their shared bed, facing each other, covered in two layers of clothes and three blankets because their father turned the heat way down whenever he wasn\u2019t home, which was often. Not often enough though in Taehyung\u2019s opinion. But they would lay like that for hours and Taehyung would tell Mina stories about their mother. He didn\u2019t have many spectacular ones\u2014being he really could only remember a few from such a young age\u2014but once those ran out, she started asking him simpler things. What did mom look like? What did she smell like? What did she sound like? Feel like?</p><p>\u201cShe looked like spring, smelled like flowers, sounded like rain and felt like sunshine.\u201d How else could he describe her? Maybe his memories were clouded by the happier life he\u2019d lived with her in it but he\u2019d rather have this version of her in his mind. He needed it. Needed something good to cling to.</p><p>*</p><p>The first time his father had hit him, he\u2019d apologized profusely afterward, and made Taehyung promise he\u2019d never tell a soul. He didn\u2019t. And he didn\u2019t the second and third time either or any time after that. He\u2019d never told anyone, other than his friends and only because they grew suspicious of the bruises and the injuries and his unexpected late night calls asking if he could sleep over.</p><p>Over the years, he became good at reading the signs and predicting when his dad was going to have an outburst. If he got home from work and slammed the door behind him, it was time to retreat to the bedroom and bolt the door. If he came with a freshly bought bottle of alcohol, it was time to leave. Taehyung\u2019s only reason for not moving out was Mina. He\u2019d made a promise to her and himself that he\u2019d always be there to protect her, even if that meant taking the brunt of the abuse himself. Which it always did.</p><p>He\u2019d ended up in the hospital a few times keeping his dad away from his sister, stepping in the way of the punches, even tackling the man to the floor to give her a chance to run. It always ended badly but he never complained. Not when it would be so much worse for her. She didn\u2019t deserve to live in fear like this. He didn\u2019t either but especially not her. He at least had good memories of their mother. She only had the nightmares that came with having a monster for a father.</p><p>When things got too hard, his friends were his escape. Five of them had their own problems. And five of them had families that would get suspicious if he came around too often and he couldn\u2019t risk anyone going to the police and tearing him away from his sister. The one person he could always count on to help and be his safe place was Namjoon.</p><p>The boy was an orphan living secretly at the gas station where he worked. Taehyung didn\u2019t have to hide anything from him. In fact, there were countless times in the past where he\u2019d show up at the gas station pounding on the door at two in the morning, broken and bleeding and Namjoon wouldn\u2019t say anything. He would just let him inside and make room for him on the small twin blow-up mattress he dragged out of the broom closet every night. And if he was too worked up to sleep, the two would go out into the city and find something to do. This usually involved spray paint and a concrete wall. More than once the two found themselves running from police sirens, having been caught mid-tag. Namjoon wasn\u2019t the best influence but he was what Taehyung needed.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cTake this,\u201d the older boy said holding out a pint of ice cream to him.</p><p>Taehyung looked down at it. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like eating ice cream right now, hyung,\u201d he uttered and swiped his tongue across the fresh cut on his lower lip. The taste of salt and iron grated against his tastebuds. His whole head hurt from the evening\u2019s beating. He was ninety percent sure he had a concussion.</p><p>\u201cFor your lip,\u201d Namjoon replied dropping it into his hand.</p><p>Taehyung winced when he touched the cold container to his wound but immediately started to feel the pain fade as his lip began to go numb.</p><p>\u201cSo, I overslept this morning,\u201d Namjoon said as he grabbed a lollipop from the rack on the counter beside where Taehyung sat and unwrapped it.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mr. Bang-nim found me this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything about all this?\u201d Taehyung asked gesturing toward the mattress on the linoleum floor.</p><p>\u201cHe said if he finds me sleeping here again, I\u2019m fired.\u201d Then he stuck the candy in his mouth and twirled the stick between his fingers.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s stomach dropped when he saw the unease written across his hyung\u2019s face. The boy had nowhere to go. Taehyung would have invited Namjoon to stay with him but of course he\u2019d never want to subject one of his friends to the hell he had to deal with every day. Though it didn\u2019t matter either way. Namjoon didn\u2019t like asking for help. He wanted to be the one his friends came to, not the other way around. The boy was independent and stubborn to a fault.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to be more careful,\u201d Namjoon said with a shrug. Of course he was only acting like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Taehyung knew better.</p><p>Light flooded the dim store as a vehicle pulled into the parking lot and Taehyung felt his heart skip at the idea they were going to be caught. But when he looked out through the storefront window, relief flooded his chest. Jin\u2019s 4x4 truck sat idling in front of the gas pumps.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted him a bit ago,\u201d Namjoon interrupted, a gentle smile lifting his mouth and causing his cheeks to dimple.</p><p>Taehyung hopped off the counter and set the pint of ice cream down before making his way outside. Jin rolled the driver\u2019s side window down, music pouring from inside the cab. The other boys\u2019 voices rose above the singer\u2019s vocals as they screamed along to the song.</p><p>\u201cLong time no see,\u201d Taehyung said slapping the oldest boy\u2019s hand when he stuck it out the window.</p><p>Jin smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a week, Tae,\u201d he said.</p><p>Taehyung shrugged. \u201cA week is an eternity in this town.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Jin\u2019s face faltered for a second and Taehyung noticed his eyes trail down to the younger\u2019s wounded lip. He quickly swiped his tongue across it to catch the remaining blood. \u201cHow\u2019s Mina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cAt a sleepover.\u201d</p><p>The oldest boy\u2019s eyes lingered on his for several moments before he finally gave a small nod. \u201cHop in,\u201d he said and motioned with his head toward the back of the truck.</p><p>Taehyung scrambled over the side and dropped into the bed beside Jimin, who sat with his back against the cab, happily cramming chips into his mouth from a bag. \u201cWant some?\u201d he asked as he offered the bag to him.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Taehyung said and barely got settled beside his friend when the truck lurched forward and they pulled back out of the gas station.</p><p>It was pretty late and almost every food place was closed save for the all-night diner they frequented. There was nothing quality or good about the food there but it was cheap, and greasy and filled their bellies. The waitresses had come to grow fond of them over the years, knowing each of them by name and favorite flavor of milkshake.</p><p>The seven of them were the only ones there, which was a good thing since they tended to get a bit rowdy. Their plates had just barely been delivered when Yoongi decided he was going to try and cheer Taehyung up by throwing a handful of french fries at Jungkook. A food fight quickly broke out between the two and the poor waitress had to dodge away to keep from getting hit by a rogue fry.</p><p>They spent hours there, stuffing their faces and drowning their problems in ketchup and grease until finally, none of them could bring themselves to take one more bite. Then they made their way sleepily back to the truck, Taehyung flopping into the bed again, this time with Namjoon, and letting his head fall onto the older boy\u2019s lap. The gentle rock of the truck as it made its way down the road and the streetlights that passed intermittently overhead made his eyelids droop dangerously low. He probably shouldn\u2019t fall asleep if he really did have a concussion, but the sound of the engine, the warmth of Namjoon\u2019s thigh pressed against his cheek and the comfortable weight of food in his belly made it impossible for him to keep his eyes open and soon he drifted off completely.</p><p>*</p><p>Taehyung woke to the strong smell of coffee wafting into his nostrils and he opened his eyes to a chipped ceramic mug inches from his face. Jimin smiled warmly from the other side. It took Taehyung a few seconds to figure out where he was and why his body was aching so bad until he shifted and realized he\u2019d slept all night in Yoongi\u2019s bathtub.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like coffee,\u201d he uttered, batting his friend\u2019s hand away.</p><p>\u201cIt woke you up, though, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Jimin asked. His voice was much too cheerful for this time of morning. What time was it anyway?</p><p>Taehyung raked his hand through his greasy hair. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost noon. You should eat something, Tae,\u201d Jimin said and offered his hand to help the boy climb out of the tub.</p><p>Panic rushed through him like ice water. \u201cNoon?\u201d he asked. \u201cI need to get home. I need to be there when Mina gets back from her sleepover.\u201d He tripped out of the bathroom and through the living room, past the other boys crowded around a table as Jin tried to build a house with a deck of cards.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up!\u201d Jungkook exclaimed throwing his arms up.</p><p>\u201cJK!\u201d Jin yelled, his hands frozen in midair. \u201cStop with the sudden movements!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d Taehyung said as he rushed past. The gust of wind he created caused Jin\u2019s card house to collapse and he let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>Taehyung didn\u2019t stop though. As soon as he was out of Yoongi\u2019s home, he broke into a run and kept running until he burst through the front door of his apartment. His eyes scanned the empty front room. Liquor and beer bottles littered the kitchen counters, junk mail piled high on the table and scattered on the floor around it. The place was a dump but that wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary. The quiet, however, was. He barely took a step when a whimper cut through the silence and then suddenly he was running again. He paused in the hallway, eyes on the shadows moving in the room at the end. The door was barely cracked open so he couldn\u2019t see who was in there. But then he heard a choked cry. Mina.</p><p>Taehyung flew back out of the hall and wrapped a fist around the first thing he could grab, a beer bottle, then charged back down the hall, bursting into the bedroom just as his father\u2019s hand connected with his sister\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her!\u201d Taehyung roared shoving him back hard.</p><p>His dad stumbled back more in surprise than pain and he stared at the boy with wild, glazed over eyes. The man reeked of alcohol even at this early hour of the day. He bared his teeth and looked like he was about to lunge. But Taehyung didn\u2019t give him the chance. He rushed forward instead, swinging the beer bottle back and sending it crashing down on his dad\u2019s skull. The man staggered again, this time stunned by the blow. The bottle had broken when it came in contact with his head.</p><p>Taehyung could have stopped there. He could have grabbed his sister and turned and ran, maybe taken her back to Yoongi\u2019s. The other boys would be able to help them. But no, the sight of his dad striking her had caused the time bomb within him to finally detonate and now he knew nothing but rage. With a scream that sounded too far away to be coming from his own lungs, Taehyung surged forward again, jabbing the broken bottle into the soft flesh of his father\u2019s stomach. He felt it lodge deep in the man\u2019s belly and a sickening groan fell from his father\u2019s lips but it did nothing to keep Taehyung from stabbing him again and again until blood soaked the front of the man\u2019s t-shirt and coated his own hands and clothes.</p><p>In the chaos, he couldn\u2019t hear anything but his own gasping breath and the cries that continued to tumble from the man in front of him until his dad finally collapsed to the floor. Then his sister\u2019s screams reached his ears, her voice already going hoarse from yelling for so long. With a violent shudder, Taehyung staggered back, letting the broken and bloodied bottle fall from his hand and clatter to the floor. His mouth fell open in a silent scream and his knees gave out. As he fell to the floor, his sister caught him, sobbing into his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Taehyung uttered. \u201cWhat have I done, Mina? What have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved me, Tae,\u201d she cried into his neck. \u201cYou saved us.\u201d</p><p>Their father lay motionless in front of them, the red spreading across his shirt until you could no longer tell what color it had been originally. It seeped down into the carpet, a dark stain that would never fully go away.</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave, Mina,\u201d Taehyung said, his voice shaking so hard it came out as barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tae,\u201d she cracked. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to.\u201d He grabbed her hard by the shoulders and pulled her down in front of him. His eyes drilled into hers. She had their mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou have to get somewhere safe. I can\u2019t come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur dad is dead!\u201d Taehyung screamed. \u201cOur dad is dead and I killed him!\u201d</p><p>A whimper fell from Mina\u2019s mouth and for the first time, Taehyung noticed the bruises welling up under he skin. There were so many. How long had their dad been hitting her before he\u2019d gotten there?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mina,\u201d he said more gently. \u201cPlease, go to a friend\u2019s house. Tell them dad isn\u2019t here and neither am I and you don\u2019t know where either of us are. Please. I\u2019ll come for you when it\u2019s safe. But until then, you have to go.\u201d</p><p>Mina nodded, her head jerking up and down erratically as she tried and failed to keep whatever last bit of composure she had. Then suddenly, she fell against him, a wail tearing from her throat and he clutched her to his chest, tears streaming down his own cheeks. His hands were coated still in his father\u2019s blood and he raked his fingers through his sister\u2019s hair, holding onto her, pulling her closer, smelling her, feeling her against him. Who knew if he\u2019d ever see her again?</p><p>Mina changed her clothes and washed the blood out of her hair from when Taehyung had held her, before rushing out of the apartment. He didn\u2019t go outside but watched her from the front window. She\u2019d texted a friend and asked them to pick her up and now he watched as she got into their car, her head lifting, her eyes locking on his one last time before she climbed into the the backseat and then she was gone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do. That moment of clarity when he\u2019d needed to get his sister away was gone and now all he could do was stare at the messy living room in shock. With his back pressed against the door, he sank down onto the carpet, his hands catching him as he fell. His hands. Covered in sticky, drying blood. His father\u2019s blood. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>A murderer.</p><p>His head began to pound as the thoughts swirled in his brain. It was all too much. Everything was too much. The coppery smell of blood filled his nose, filled his head, filled the room and it overwhelmed him. His hands shook and his breath hitched and he couldn\u2019t inhale deep enough. Too much. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>His eyes watered and his nerves were shot and he was numb but could feel everything at the same time and it was overwhelming. His skin crawled and his heart hammered and his lungs were on fire and he couldn\u2019t breathe and he squeezed his eyes shut as if he could shut out the world and it was all too much. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>A murderer.</p><p>*</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, it was dark. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d fallen asleep or passed out but when his gaze fell on the digital clock on the microwave, he saw that he\u2019d been out for nearly nine hours.</p><p>It was silent in the apartment. Silent as the dead. His head slumped to the side and he looked at the entrance to the hallway. His father was back there. Or rather, his body. If he crawled just six feet to his left, he\u2019d be able to peer down the hall and see his dad\u2019s body slumped against the wall in the back bedroom. Immediately, Taehyung felt like he was going to be sick. He made his way clumsily to his feet and tripped into the kitchen, barely making it to the sink before he heaved and the contents of his stomach emptied into the basin. He spit a few times before sitting up again, a sheen of sweat coating his skin. When he brought his arm up to wipe his forehead, his eyes locked on the brown, dried blood that crusted on his skin. Then he looked down again at his white t-shirt. Well, it used to be white.</p><p>He rushed out of the kitchen, turning his head away as he passed the hall so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally catch a glimpse of what was at the other end, then slipped out the front door, locking it behind him. He zipped his jacket up to his chin, glad that at least the dark sweatshirt hid the stains, and pulled the hood up over his hair and his sleeves down over his hands. He kept his head down to conceal any blood spatters on his face as he made his way through the dark streets and to the gas station.</p><p>To his relief, there were no cars there, but then another thought occurred to him. What if Namjoon wasn\u2019t there either? What if he\u2019d been caught again by his boss? He had to be there. Taehyung didn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to.</p><p>He jogged up to the front door and peered in. The place was dark. It looked deserted. As the panic started to set in, he raised his fist and beat it against the glass. At last, he caught movement from within. And then Namjoon appeared in one of the aisles toward the back. He seemed to recognize who it was immediately and hurried over. A lollipop stick stuck out of his mouth and he switched it from one corner to the other in a nervous habit as he unlocked the door and opened it. Only then did he notice that Taehyung was covered in blood. Slowly, he lifted a hand and pulled the candy out of his mouth.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s breath quivered as he met the older boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI did something really bad, hyung.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c22cc05dfed25979cd8bccaa2fb299e/tumblr_inline_plrim8qsxI1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrox5bo8Z1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>05. Whalien 52</b></h2><p><i>Finding the minuscule fissures in the surface and digging its fingers in until we began to splinter.</i></p><p><b>February.<br></b></p><p>An annoying ringing shattered the silence within the dark gas station causing Kim Namjoon to stir. With a groan, he started to roll over on his mattress when his body hit something. He froze in his half-sleep before remembering he wasn\u2019t alone on his bed. An arm flew out and draped over his shoulder, hand hovering in front of his face.</p><p>\u201cTae,\u201d he uttered and reached over to turn the alarm off on his phone.</p><p>Taehyung didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cTae,\u201d Namjoon said again a little louder. This time the boy let out a sleepy groan which tapered off into a snore. With a sigh, Namjoon got up off the mattress, his joints cracking as he did so and he winced rubbing his stiff neck. \u201cTae, you have to get up. You can\u2019t be here when Mr. Bang-nim shows up.\u201d</p><p>It was still dark outside but Namjoon had learned never to let himself sleep until sunrise again. The gas station he worked at was a weird one that actually closed at night unlike the majority of the other stations in town. He was the opening and closing shift Monday through Friday and his boss took the middle shift, but the man came early in the morning to drop off the day\u2019s till and Namjoon couldn\u2019t be caught sleeping there again. One more time and he\u2019d be fired and back on the street.<br></p><p>*</p><p>He\u2019d been by himself for much of his life. His parents had left him with his grandmother one weekend saying they were going on a special vacation for their anniversary. Only, they never came back. Namjoon\u2019s grandmother was an old, frail woman. Much too frail to take on a child\u2014he was barely five at the time\u2014and he spent most of his childhood fending for himself. When he was twelve, she developed cancer and passed away within just a few weeks of receiving the news. As soon as she died, Namjoon ran. He was so afraid of being put into foster care, never having a real home, never having a real family. He\u2019d basically already been fending for himself for seven years before that.</p><p>There\u2019d never been any record of his parents abandoning him or him living with his grandmother so it wasn\u2019t hard for him to disappear without a trace. The boy was clever and intelligent for his age and he was able to make it into the city and fake his way into school. He didn\u2019t care much for the classes, but going to school meant getting breakfast and lunch for free. It was there that he met Hoseok. The two became friends quickly, both having an interest in music. Hoseok was a dancer and Namjoon loved writing songs and melodies. Hoseok was already close with Yoongi who at this point was just discovering his love for producing. Together, the three of them would spend hours after school at Hoseok\u2019s house\u2014since Namjoon didn\u2019t have one and Yoongi\u2019s parents didn\u2019t approve of his newfound hobby\u2014writing music together that Yoongi would then go home and produce on his computer. Nothing ever came of it but for Namjoon, this was a pivotal time in his life. He developed a friendship with a small group that grew bigger until there were seven of them, the others like the family he never had. Brothers he was so desperate for. And for this friendship, he\u2019d be eternally grateful.</p><p>Eventually, they all figured out his situation, though he tried to hide it as he didn\u2019t want to be a burden on any of them. They found ways to help him out though, whether it was Jimin inviting him over for dinner once a week or Yoongi asking him to stay the night\u2014or several nights\u2014to help him work on a new song. The boys helped him as much as he would let them.</p><p>Taehyung, though, helped him the most, probably without even realizing it. The first time Taehyung called asking if he could stay with him\u2014at that time he had been working and sleeping at the gas station for a few months\u2014Namjoon was hesitant to let him. He\u2019d needed a job so he could afford food and a cellphone and already felt guilty having to secretly sleep at the station but he had nowhere else to go, and he worked the opening and closing shift anyway, so what was even the point of leaving at night? But then when Taehyung showed up at the gas station with a broken nose and a bruise on his throat that resembled a handprint, Namjoon couldn\u2019t turn him away.</p><p>Sure, the other boys were amazing. Always willing to help him, always wanting to do whatever they could, but it made him feel reliant on them and the last thing he wanted was to not be able to take care of himself. But Taehyung wasn\u2019t like that. Taehyung made him feel needed for once.</p><p>*</p><p>When he\u2019d shown up in the middle of the night covered in blood a month before, Namjoon hadn\u2019t wasted any time pulling him into the bathroom and helping clean him up as much as he could. He used the small travel size shampoos and soaps the gas station carried and scrubbed at Taehyung\u2019s hair and skin until the water in the sink ran clear. He had him change into the only other set of clothes he had, taking the bloody ones, dousing them with bleach and lighter fluid and then bagging them up and tossing them into the dumpster in the alley.</p><p>Then together, the two of them went back to Taehyung\u2019s apartment. Namjoon and Taehyung\u2014silent in his still shocked state\u2014dragged the body of Taehyung\u2019s father into the bathroom and dumped him into the tub. After that, Namjoon put Taehyung to work in the kitchen, having him bag up all the liquor bottles and the mail on the floor while he took care of the back bedroom. He scrubbed at the carpet with bleach until there was no trace of blood left.</p><p>He\u2019d grabbed several bags of ice and two rolls of duct tape from the gas station and now he emptied the bags into the tub before taping the window shut. Then, he shut and locked the door and sealed the cracks. With his eyes and nose now burning with the smell of bleach, Namjoon finally made his way back into the living room, only to find Taehyung standing there in the middle of it completely still.</p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his name, the boy had looked up to meet Namjoon\u2019s eyes. Taehyung\u2019s face was shining with tears as they trailed down his cheeks but you\u2019d never know he was crying by his stone-like expression.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even feel bad for doing it, hyung,\u201d he\u2019d uttered and when Namjoon looked down at his hands, they were clenched into trembling fists. \u201cI was just so angry. I couldn\u2019t stop. What\u2019s wrong with me, hyung? Why don\u2019t I feel guilty for killing my father?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon had dropped the bag full of bloody paper towels and bleach right there next to the hallway and rushed over to Taehyung just in time to catch him before he could collapse to the floor. The boy sobbed into his chest, clinging so tightly to him that his fingers bruised his skin. Namjoon held him for a long time there in the middle of the living room, not saying a word and not loosening his tight grip on him. Finally, Taehyung\u2019s sobs quieted to sporadic sniffles and then he let go of Namjoon, sitting back on his butt and dragging his hands down his face to wipe his tears away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Taehyung had asked, his voice raspy and low.</p><p>Namjoon looked around at the several trash bags filled with evidence of their being there. His attempt to conceal the body wasn\u2019t going to hold up forever. Eventually, it was going to start to smell and someone was going to discover it. Not to mention the man had a job. His absence wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed for long.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you far away from here,\u201d Namjoon finally said and Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened in fear.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t send me away, hyung,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this on my own.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Namjoon got to his feet and held a hand out to him. \u201cThen we need to figure out a way for you to hide.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Taehyung had been staying with him ever since then. Every morning before the sun came up, he would leave and every night after closing, he\u2019d return. Namjoon wasn\u2019t sure what he did during the day and would spend the whole time worrying the boy wasn\u2019t going to show up in the evening, but so far, he always did.</p><p>\u201cTae, come on, man,\u201d Namjoon said again, giving the boy a hard push and sending him rolling off the other side of the mattress with a groan of protest. \u201cUnless you want to hide in a broom closet all day, you have to get out of here.\u201d Taehyung finally stirred, getting slowly to his feet.</p><p>He rubbed at his eyes, staggered and caught himself on a rack of magazines before he could topple over. \u201cDon\u2019t make me leave today, hyung,\u201d he whined. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out there and I don\u2019t have anything to do. Just let me stay here today, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get caught?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung slowly peeled one eye open to look up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll stay hidden. I promise. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Just then, headlights flashed across their faces and Namjoon\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cGet in the bathroom,\u201d he said quickly before shoving him into the tiny space. Then he picked up the air mattress and threw it in after him. Luckily, the thing was light. After looking around to make sure there was no evidence of him being there, Namjoon ran into the backroom, unlocking the door that lead to the alley and slipping outside.He stood there behind the store for several minutes, waiting for his heart to stop hammering and the sweat that had broken out on his skin to dry. It was cold outside. A cold so sharp it stung his lungs with each breath and made his head hurt.</p><p>At last, he stuffed his numb hands into his pockets and, as nonchalantly as possible, walked around to the front of the store to meet his boss.</p><p>Mr. Bang was just getting out of his SUV when Namjoon came around the corner. The sky had lightened to a pale gray already.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Namjoon,\u201d the man said with a friendly smile and made his way toward the locked front doors.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sir,\u201d Namjoon replied. He watched with coiled nerves as his boss withdrew a key and unlocked the store. Then when he followed him inside, Namjoon\u2019s eyes shifted to the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few boxes in the back that need unpacked if you want to do that while I open the register,\u201d Mr. Bang said as he slipped behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cAlready done, sir,\u201d Namjoon replied shifting nervously from one foot to the other.</p><p>A sharp knock came from the direction of the bathroom just then causing Namjoon to jump. Immediately, he felt his face go pale. Maybe Mr. Bang hadn\u2019t heard. But when he looked back at his boss and saw that the man was looking curiously now at the bathroom, a sense of dread overcame him.</p><p>\u201cWe better not have a rat problem again,\u201d the man uttered to himself as he, to Namjoon\u2019s horror, got out from behind the counter again and made his way toward the bathroom at the back of the store.</p><p>Namjoon watched as everything seemed to move in slow motion. His eyes could only focus on the man\u2019s hand as he reached for the doorknob, and silently begin to pray that by some miracle, Taehyung would somehow be able to squeeze his long, lanky body into a dark corner and disappear.</p><p>No such luck. The door creaked open, revealing an unsuspecting Taehyung, blanket wrapped around him as he sat on the cold tile floor.</p><p>Namjoon let out a groan and squeezed his eyes shut. Maybe his boss would keep it a secret. Maybe he\u2019d understand the situation and let them stay. No, he knew better than that.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Taehyung said quietly, his mouth lifting into a guilty smile.</p><p>Namjoon\u2019s eyes drilled into the back of his boss\u2019s head as he waited with bated breath for the man to speak. The silence was thick, making it hard for Namjoon to pull air into his lungs. Then at last, the owner of the gas station turned to look at him. The expression on his face was unreadable at first. Completely blank like a mannequin\u2019s. Surely, the man recognized Taehyung from the news. The boy\u2019s picture and his father\u2019s had been on every network since the discovery of the man\u2019s body in their apartment. The police had already questioned the other boys, none of them giving any sort of answer more than a shrug and an \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him,\u201d and Namjoon hadn\u2019t even been questioned since there wasn\u2019t any record of him existing in the city anyway.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, come outside with me,\u201d Mr. Bang finally said, his voice steady, his face still unreadable.</p><p>With a quick glance back at Taehyung, Namjoon followed after him through the back room and out the exit into the alley.</p><p>Mr. Bang finally turned to face him, raking his hands down his face with a heavy sigh. \u201cNamjoon, I\u2019ve turned a blind eye a lot over the three years you\u2019ve worked for me. I paid you under the table. Didn\u2019t say anything when stock didn\u2019t match with my inventory list. \u00a0Didn\u2019t say anything when I found out you were sleeping here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Mr. Bang interrupted. \u201cAnd I hoped it was only temporary. But Namjoon, you\u2019re harboring a fugitive. I can\u2019t have that in my store. I could lose the business. I could go to jail. I\u2019m sorry but the two of you are going to have to go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon squeezed his eyes shut. He just had to think for a moment. There had to be some way for him to be able to keep his job. He wet his lips. \u201cMr. Bang\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t call the police. But you can\u2019t work here anymore. I\u2019m sorry, Namjoon. I really am.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, the boy opened his eyes again, finally meeting his boss\u2019s\u2014well, former boss\u2019s. The man had been like a father to him for the past three years. A good boss. Which had made Namjoon work hard to be a good employee. He\u2019d only taken items when he was really desperate. Though, lately he\u2019d been a lot more careless. Taking candy and food and alcohol. Even if he wasn\u2019t hiding Taehyung, he deserved to be fired. Finally, Namjoon took another deep breath. \u201cI understand, sir,\u201d he said and extended his hand. \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s mouth lifted into a sad smile as he reached out and shook Namjoon\u2019s hand. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do for you. If you need money, or a lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thank you, sir,\u201d Namjoon cut him off. \u201cI can take care of this on my own.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bang gave him a sharp nod. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a few minutes to collect your things.\u201d Then he turned and went back into his store.</p><p>Namjoon stood there in the alley for several more minutes, eyes on the ground as he kicked at the gravel with his shoe. What was he going to do now? He was homeless again. Homeless and harboring a fugitive. Taehyung wouldn\u2019t last long on the streets. Namjoon had been taking care of himself for a long time. He knew what parts of town to avoid. He knew how to evade. Where to go if he needed temporary shelter. How to survive on as little food as possible. But Taehyung\u2026he was only a boy. While his life hadn\u2019t been a luxurious one, or even an okay one, at least he\u2019d had a roof over his head. Clothes on his back. Food in his stomach. He needed that again.</p><p>Finally, Namjoon went back inside. Taehyung was leaning against the bathroom doorframe, his hands stuffed deep into his pockets, his bottom lip between his teeth. He straightened up when he saw his hyung come from the back room.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Namjoon said walking past him to the broom closet.</p><p>Taehyung followed after him. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon opened the closet and grabbed his worn, black backpack then started stuffing his few belongings into it. Beanie, face mask, phone charger, copy of Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, a journal and a pen.</p><p>\u201cHyung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d Namjoon replied and pulled the confused boy after him.</p><p>Mr. Bang stood by the door, a shopping bag in one hand and an envelope in the other. He held them out to Namjoon as they approached. \u201cTake these.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked down at the bag. He could see several cups of ramen, water bottles and a few other things through the opaque plastic.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help, sir,\u201d he said and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Taehyung look at him.</p><p>\u201cHyung, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my responsibility,\u201d Namjoon interrupted. \u201cI can take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least take your last paycheck.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon glanced down at the thick envelope then up at his former boss as he took it from him. When he opened the envelope, his eyes widened. \u201cSir, I can\u2019t accept this. It\u2019s so much more than my normal pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust consider it severance.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Namjoon stuffed the envelope into the pocket of his coat and looked again at the man. \u201cThank you for giving me the opportunity to work for you, sir. And for letting me stay here for as long as you did.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bang gave him a tight-lipped nod before stepping out of the way so he could pull Taehyung out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now, hyung?\u201d Taehyung asked as the two made their way back into the alley behind the gas station.</p><p>\u201cFor now, we find somewhere to hide until it\u2019s dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon yanked him down between two dumpsters just as a car pulled into the alley a block down. The two sat there in tense silence until it passed by them. Then Namjoon peaked his head out, not letting Taehyung get back up until the car had turned out of the alley and onto the street.</p><p>\u201cHyung?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the boy who looked back with saddened eyes. He seemed so much younger, so much smaller all of a sudden. He was only a couple years Namjoon\u2019s junior but the uneasy expression on his face made him look like a scared child. Namjoon opened his backpack and pulled out his beanie and face mask.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tae,\u201d Namjoon said handing the things to him. After Taehyung put them on, Namjoon pulled him against him and they made their way farther down the alley. \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>Throughout the day, Namjoon racked his brain, trying to come up with a solution to this rather large problem of theirs. He couldn\u2019t ask any of the guys. Yoongi could lose his home if he was caught with Taehyung, and the others lived with their families. But maybe Jin\u2026</p><p>*</p><p>The oldest boy in the group was home for an extended weekend and was the one to answer the door when Namjoon knocked. He\u2019d had Taehyung hide in the shadows created by the neatly trimmed hedge along the side of the house just in case one of Jin\u2019s parents answered instead.</p><p>\u201cJoon?\u201d Jin said stepping out onto the porch. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been busy,\u201d Namjoon replied and looked down at his feet. He hated being here. He hated what he was about to do. Hated asking for help. Because it just made him feel like he wasn\u2019t capable. Like he was worthless.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here so late?\u201d Jin asked, pulling him out of his dark thoughts. \u201cIs something going on? Are the others alright?\u201d Suddenly his eyes widened in horror. \u201cIs it Taehyung?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon bit his lip and gave a pathetic chuckle. \u201cYeah, I guess you could say that,\u201d he said then heard a rustle behind him as Taehyung stepped into the light.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jin-hyung.\u201d</p><p>Jin\u2019s eyes darted to the side to meet the younger boy\u2019s over Namjoon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cTae?\u201d Then he looked at Namjoon again. \u201cHas he been with you this whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s been staying with me at the gas station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the two of you haven\u2019t been caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were today,\u201d Taehyung answered, his words muffled by the face mask he was still wearing, and stuffed his hands into the pockets of the coat Namjoon had given him a month ago.</p><p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t be here,\u201d Jin said and took a step back so he was back on the other side of the threshold. \u201cI already had to lie to the police and to my parents\u2026and if anyone sees us talking\u2014\u201d</p><p>Namjoon let out a heavy sigh and looked up at Jin. \u201cTae has nowhere to go, hyung. He needs you right now.\u201d</p><p>Jin shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he cracked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joon, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Anger flooded Namjoon\u2019s gut as he bit the inside of his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be his friend,\u201d Namjoon uttered so Taehyung couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cAny of the other guys wouldn\u2019t even hesitate to help. You know I wouldn\u2019t normally ask for a favor but I\u2019m desperate. Please don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>Jin lifted his eyes to the ceiling, blinking hard and letting his head fall back. \u201cJoon, I don\u2019t think you understand what you\u2019re asking of me, here.\u201d Then he looked at him again. \u201cWhere would I hide him? How would I keep this from my parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother, hyung\u201d Namjoon growled. \u201cYou would <i>figure</i> it out because that\u2019s what family <i>does</i>.\u201d</p><p>Jin stepped back further, hand reaching up to grip the doorknob. He looked like he was ready to turn and run. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys,\u201d he said again shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to ask. I\u2019m sorry. Really. I wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p><p><i>There is something you can do</i>, Namjoon thought as he ground his teeth together. But he just stared back at the boy. He could see the despair written across Jin\u2019s face. Maybe he really was trapped. Maybe he really couldn\u2019t help no matter how much he wanted to. At last, Namjoon\u2019s face smoothed then with a heavy sigh, he turned around. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Tae.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gave a curt nod then looked back up at Jin where he stood in his doorway. \u201cBye, Jin-hyung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tae,\u201d he cracked.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon didn\u2019t turn around again to say goodbye. His chest felt so tight, he didn\u2019t even know if he could speak. So instead, he kept walking down the path, Taehyung\u2019s footsteps echoing behind him. Then he heard the faint sound of the door closing and the tightness dissipated, leaving him feeling emptier than he ever had before.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go now, hyung?\u201d Taehyung asked from behind him.</p><p>It was so cold now and Namjoon had no idea what to tell the younger boy. They couldn\u2019t stay out in the open like this. Someone would eventually recognize Taehyung. No, he needed to get out of the city. Far away. He needed to disappear.</p><p>Namjoon lifted his head, looked farther down the street, his eyes settling on the empty bus stop. Immediately he felt a lump forming in his stomach. He knew what he had to do.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said taking Taehyung\u2019s arm in his hand and pulling him down the sidewalk. When they reached the bus stop, he had the younger boy sit on the bench as he studied the schedule attached to a pole. A bus would be arriving any minute. Just their luck.</p><p>\u201cAre we going somewhere?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t.\u201d Then he sucked in a sharp breath and turned to face the boy. \u201cBut you are.\u201d Then Namjoon tugged his beanie down further over Taehyung\u2019s ears and lifted the mask around his neck up to cover the lower half of his face. In the bulky sweater and coat he wore, his lanky, teenage body was well hidden making it hard to tell how old he was.</p><p>\u201cWait until you\u2019re at least a few towns over before you get off,\u201d Namjoon said, trying his hardest not to meet the scared boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen you need to find some sort of shelter. If you can stay there, do it. If not, try to stay in populated parts of town. You\u2019ll be safer that way. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, hyung,\u201d Taehyung said, his eyes turned down in the corners and silently pleading with Namjoon not to make him go.</p><p>Namjoon felt his heart shatter in his chest. He\u2019d told Taehyung he\u2019d keep him safe and he\u2019d failed. With a sharp intake of breath to clear the fog from his eyes, he shoved his hand into the pocket of his coat and withdrew the envelope of money he\u2019d received from Mr. Bang.</p><p>\u201cTake this,\u201d he said to Taehyung and pressed it into his hand, not even giving him a chance to reach out and take it himself.</p><p>\u201cBut, hyung, this is all your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Namjoon said with a shake of his head. \u201cYou need it more than I do. Please, just take it and find some place safe to hide.\u201d At last he met the boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cJust find somewhere to stay put and once everything calms down, I\u2019ll come and find you. We\u2019ll figure something out together, okay?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded and then the two turned when the bus came around the corner. Suddenly, Namjoon felt unease like a chunk of ice settle in his gut. Maybe this was a mistake. His thoughts were interrupted though when Taehyung threw his arms around the older boy and clutched onto him for dear life.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you, hyung.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon pulled his bottom lip into his mouth and bit down hard to keep the tears from spilling over. In a moment of weakness, he buried his head into the younger boy\u2019s neck, and inhaled deeply. In all honesty, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do without Taehyung either.</p><p>Namjoon was the one to finally pull away. With a hard sniff, he stepped back, letting one hand linger on the boy\u2019s shoulder for just a moment longer, giving it a fond squeeze before dropping his arm entirely. The bus had already been sitting for a little while behind them, the driver waiting for the two to finish saying their goodbyes.</p><p>\u201cCall me any time day or night if you need anything,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t need anything, just call sometimes so I know you\u2019re alright.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded quickly, his breath trembling in the cold. Or maybe it was something else. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon,\u201d he said, his voice low and quivering just a bit.</p><p>Namjoon nodded back then motioned with his chin toward the bus. He watched Taehyung step on, stopping at the top of the stairs to pay for his fare before heading back to find a seat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever see Taehyung again. And as the bus pulled away, he hoped and prayed to whatever was out there that he would, but something told him this was a permanent goodbye.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4df17cf204417156d0ae1b5d07da07a8/tumblr_inline_plriogg9ll1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plroyyll771qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>06. House of Cards</b></h2><p><i>It wasn\u2019t long before we\u2019d break apart, shatter like a glass vase on the tile floor.</i><br></p><p><b>March.</b><br></p><p>Min Yoongi let out a heavy sigh, leaning way back in his computer chair until his spine gave a satisfying crack. He\u2019d been sitting hunched forward at his desk for hours now and this song he\u2019d been working on for the past two weeks was just starting to finally take shape. His stomach growled and he glanced up at the corner of his monitor to see that three hours had passed since the last time he checked. Which meant he hadn\u2019t eaten anything in almost six.</p><p><i>Just a little bit longer,</i> he thought and rolled his shoulders before leaning back in.</p><p>The sound of a groan and the crunch of couch springs came from the room next to him and Yoongi pushed back in his chair again to peer through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cKook-ah,\u201d he cracked, his voice raspy from not being used in so long. \u201cAre you getting up?\u201d</p><p>The maknae groaned again but sat up, his eyes still shut and his bottom lip jutting forward in a sleepy pout.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get going soon so you aren\u2019t late for school.\u201d</p><p>Another groan. \u201cBut it\u2019s Friday. Can\u2019t I just skip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\u2019s been gone for almost a month now. You want Jimin to be alone?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was silent for a few seconds as he mulled over Yoongi\u2019s words. \u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d he said then with a huff, got to his feet.</p><p>A satisfied smile tugged at the corner of Yoongi\u2019s mouth as he sat up and rolled back over to his desk, the wheels of his chair catching and scraping against the plywood floor.</p><p>His place was nothing special. Sheet rocked walls, plywood floors and no windows. He wouldn\u2019t even call it a house. He\u2019d barely call it livable. But it was home.</p><p>Each of the guys\u2014besides Jin\u2014had lived there at one time or another with him and Jungkook basically lived there all the time. Yoongi didn\u2019t mind. He\u2019d grown very fond of the boy. In fact, he saw a lot of himself in him. The kid was driven. He had so much potential. But life had dealt him a cruel hand. Luckily for him, Yoongi had been through something similar.</p><p>*</p><p>His parents had been the type to have his life mapped out for him from birth. They knew where he was to go to school, what college, what classes, what major, what profession he was supposed to end up with. He was their golden child and he tried to live up to their impossibly high standards for as long as he could. But music never factored in for them and when he discovered his love for it in middle school, his priorities changed. No longer did he have time for all of his AP classes or clubs or sports. It was music, music, music.</p><p>At sixteen, he dropped out and his parents\u2014disgusted at their disgrace of a son\u2014wanted nothing to do with him. Quickly, their golden child became less valuable than tarnished brass and they dumped him out on the street.</p><p>That was almost four years ago. The boy still spent most nights working on songs, writing, producing, marketing to try and get his foot in the door of the music industry but nothing had really happened. He wasn\u2019t one to give up though.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHyung, have you slept at all?\u201d Jungkook asked peaking his head into the doorway of Yoongi\u2019s studio.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes stayed glued to his monitor. \u201cI slept yesterday,\u201d he uttered suddenly feeling a rush of fatigue. He blinked hard.</p><p>\u201cHave you at least eaten recently?\u201d Jungkook took the older boy\u2019s silence as a no and leaned in to place a bowl with an apple and a boiled egg on the edge of his desk. \u201cTry to get some rest today, hyung.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grunted in reply, missing the fond smile that curled the corners of Jungkook\u2019s mouth upward. A few seconds later, he heard the front door open. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your homework!\u201d he called out.</p><p>Jungkook let out an exasperated cry before Yoongi heard frantic rustling, then a \u201cbye, hyung!\u201d and finally, the heavy door of the train car dragging across the ground and slamming shut with a metal <i>clang</i>. Once the echo faded, Yoongi cracked his neck and then leaned in again to his computer. This project wasn\u2019t like any he\u2019d worked on in the past. This one could possibly be the most important of his life.</p><p>He\u2019d seen a job posting for a producing gig in Seoul; a position at a very well known label. One that had put out nothing but incredible music since it started. At first Yoongi had been hesitant to apply but then decided to give it a shot. What was the worse that could happen? They reject him?</p><p>Actually, yes. Rejection was the literal worst thing that could happen to Yoongi. Burn his house down. Steal all his money. Run him over with your car. But please. Please don\u2019t tell him that the thing he\u2019s worked so hard on, the thing that he\u2019s so passionate about, the thing that made his parents actually kick him out of his house, isn\u2019t good enough. Nothing scared him more than that.</p><p>Yoongi pushed back from his desk again. The symbolic weight of this project had taken its toll on him over the past few weeks, causing tight knots to form in his shoulders and migraines to drill into the space between his eyes until pain killers and alcohol couldn\u2019t even dull the ache. Maybe he really did need to get some rest. Ah, but he was so close. He could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just a few more hours. Another day maybe. Just a little bit longer and it would be finished. And then the painstakingly long wait for their reply.</p><p>With an anxiety filled sigh, he grabbed the apple from Jungkook out of the bowl and took a bite.</p><p>*</p><p>Just as he thought, the song took him another two days to complete. Two more sleep and food deprived, caffeine fueled days. By the time he submitted his song, he felt ready to sleep for the next three months. Instead, that night while he was tossing and turning in bed, his phone screen lit up with an email. He reached over for it, squinting at the bright screen in the darkness. His heavy eyes popped open when he saw the name of the sender and he sat bolt upright. His heart pounded as he clicked on the email. His hands shook and he dropped his phone, scrambling to pick it up so he could finally find out if his effort had been for nothing. Then he opened the email with bated breath and his eyes roved over the first line of the email.</p><p><i>Mr. Min,</i></p><p><i>We were impressed with your song and\u2026</i></p><p>Yoongi read the whole email several times before letting the meaning of the words completely sink in. He\u2019d made it. He\u2019d made it? Yoongi got to his feet in one fluid motion.</p><p>\u201cI made it?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, he wanted to run into the living room where Jungkook was sleeping soundly and jump up and down on him, screaming until the maknae was celebrating with him. He wanted to call the others. He wanted to share the good news. But\u2026</p><p>What about Jungkook? What would the kid do if Yoongi up and moved to the big city? Of course he\u2019d want to come with him. To drop out of school, leave his foster family, leave the rest of the guys behind to follow him. No, Yoongi couldn\u2019t let him do that. His whole life was here. He needed to graduate. He needed to go to college. Make something of himself. Get out of this perpetual life of suck he was currently in. But could Yoongi leave him behind? Sure, Jungkook needed him, needed his couch, needed the security of having somewhere and someone that actually cared about him as a person instead of as a means to a paycheck from the government. But Yoongi kind of needed him too. It was nice having someone that cared about his well-being when that was usually the furthest thing from his own mind. Jungkook was always asking him if he\u2019d slept, if he\u2019d eaten, if he\u2019d showered, recently.</p><p>Jungkook was the one to keep him connected to the rest of the guys most of the time. He would have become a hermit by now if the kid wasn\u2019t constantly inviting them over to hang out. It wasn\u2019t that Yoongi didn\u2019t like having them over. It wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t value their friendship. He could just so easily get so wrapped up in a project that he\u2019d be glued to his computer for weeks. Jungkook kept him grounded. Kept him in this world instead of in his head all the time.</p><p>But this was Yoongi\u2019s dream. This was the validation he\u2019d been denied by his parents. The validation he needed. But the question was, what did he need more?</p><p>*</p><p>Yoongi slumped on the farthest cushion on the couch from Jungkook, empty glass in his hand. He\u2019d been sitting there for a while, rolling the last bit of his bitter drink around in the bottom of the glass and trying to figure out how he could possibly break the news to Jungkook that he\u2019d be leaving for Seoul the next day.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told anyone about the job offer, or rather the prospective job offer. There hadn\u2019t actually been a contract signed but Yoongi had a very good feeling that there\u2019d be one waiting for him once he got there. He\u2019d been in contact with the label since that first fateful email a week before. They\u2019d sent him several files to tweak and send back. Just more tests of his producing capabilities. They seemed impressed.</p><p>*</p><p>This party was in celebration of Taehyung coming back to them\u2014not that they ever needed a reason to get together. He\u2019d ended up getting picked up by the police a week before a few cities over and when he tried calling Namjoon, he got an automated message saying the boy\u2019s service had been disconnected. Much to Namjoon\u2019s dismay and the other guys insistence, he\u2019d had been couch surfing for the past month while he looked for a job. Since he hadn\u2019t been able to find one, he couldn\u2019t pay his bill and his phone was disconnected.</p><p>Luckily, Taehyung\u2019s next phone call had been to Jin, who had managed to persuade his lawyer father to bail the boy out and represent him in his upcoming trial. Of course, Jin had to threaten to drop out of college to get his parents to comply but they finally did much to his relief. He\u2019d felt sick with guilt for weeks after having to turn Namjoon and Taehyung away that night they showed up at his door. He\u2019d wanted nothing more than to invite them both in and promise the younger boys that everything was going to be okay. But what could have happened if they were caught under his roof? What would have become of his father\u2019s reputation? Of his schooling? \u00a0Even now with Taehyung in his care and out of jail, he couldn\u2019t get rid of the guilt that still hung over his head. And now he stood in Yoongi\u2019s kitchen, slumped against the counter, nursing his own drink.</p><p>Namjoon was having his own pity party in a different corner. The boy had confided in Yoongi a lot over the past month. Yoongi had never seen him so worked up and simultaneously so low before. His self-appointed purpose in life for so long had been as the support for his friends. As a guardian for Taehyung. And now he\u2019d failed him. Namjoon had become even more of a wreck after waking up to find his phone had been disconnected and that Taehyung had tried calling him from jail.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there when he needed me the most, hyung,\u201d he\u2019d said to Yoongi one night, tears slipping down his cheeks. \u201cWhat kind of friend am I?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Even with this being a party, no one seemed to be in a celebratory mood. While the three oldest brooded in their respective places, and Hoseok tried not to pass out from exhaustion on an arm chair, the three youngest clung to each other on the other side of the couch. The last couple of months had been traumatizing for Taehyung. From killing his father, to wandering around a strange city, to getting arrested and having to spend several nights in a jail cell not knowing his fate, it had all been too much.</p><p>When Jin and Jin\u2019s father had gone to pick him up from the police station, he\u2019d looked like a completely different person. His skin was pale and pulled taut over his bones, more prominent since he hadn\u2019t eaten much while on the run. He hadn\u2019t said a word to Jin and only uttered a \u201cthank you\u201d to Mr. Kim. His face had been completely blank and he could barely make eye contact with his oldest friend. The boy had seemed like nothing more than a shell of his former self. He warmed up a bit over the following weeks, opening up just barely, talking a little more, filling back out, and much to the others\u2019 relief, color began to return to his skin again. But that haunting look in his eyes was still there. Who knew if it would ever go away?</p><p>With one of his supports no longer by his side at school all day, Jimin had started to notice the menacing looks again from Jiho and his friends. After being ambushed a couple months back, his anxiety had been through the roof, his nerves on edge all day every day. It was exhausting. Especially keeping up a positive front for Jungkook. The poor kid was trying so hard to be there for Jimin but the original idea had been for either he <i>or</i> Taehyung to be in all of Jimin\u2019s classes which left the boy vulnerable at times. Jiho was smart. He\u2019d never touch Jimin in school but he could intimidate him which was almost worse. It made Jimin flinch at every little thing. Made him hesitate before turning corners. Made him shrink into Jungkook causing them to stumble over each other, get tangled up. Jungkook couldn\u2019t miss a single day, couldn\u2019t rest for a single moment if it meant Jimin being without his protection.</p><p>The three of them looked exhausted. Looked defeated there slumped on the couch with controllers in their hands as they played some mindless video game on Yoongi\u2019s little tv. Yoongi could see just how affected they\u2019d each become by everything over the past couple of months. The bags under their eyes. The way they leaned into each other as if making sure they were really there. The way Jimin\u2019s leg constantly touched Taehyung\u2019s as if to say, \u201c<i>It\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d </i>while his other shoulder touched Jungkook\u2019s as if to say, \u201c<i>please don\u2019t leave me.</i>\u201d</p><p>That was it. Yoongi had to break the news to Jungkook. He couldn\u2019t let him come with him. Jimin needed Jungkook. Hoseok needed Jimin. Taehyung needed Jin. Namjoon needed Taehyung. The group needed to stay together. At least the rest of them. They\u2019d be fine without Yoongi. They\u2019d find another place to hang out. Everything would be fine. But how to break the news to the youngest maknae? Yoongi looked down at his empty glass. Maybe a bit more liquid courage would help. He felt too conflicted right now. Too guilty still.</p><p>With a groan, he got up off the couch and he made his way to the kitchen. He was already feeling pretty out of it\u2014the fact that he hadn\u2019t slept well for over a week was definitely part of it. Seeing Jin there blocking the alcohol made anger flare up in the pit of his stomach. Sure the boy had eventually helped Taehyung by bailing him out of jail but the kid wouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place if Jin hadn\u2019t turned him away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing in front of the booze,\u201d Yoongi uttered. The only reason Jin was there was because he\u2019d brought Taehyung, and because\u2014despite the fact that Yoongi kind of hated him right now\u2014he was still part of the group.</p><p>Jin didn\u2019t say anything, instead just stepped to the side so Yoongi could grab the half empty bottle of whiskey. He didn\u2019t even bother pouring more into his cup, just brought the mouth of the bottle to his lips and tossed his head back. The alcohol burned its way down his throat, liquid fire pooling in his belly until he finally had to stop so he could take a breath. Then he lowered his head again, his unfocused eyes landing on Jin.</p><p>\u201cYou know what my problem is with you?\u201d he asked as he jabbed a finger into the older boy\u2019s face.</p><p>Completely taken off guard, Jin tried to step back but was already flush against the counter and cupboards. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap, <i>hyung</i>,\u201d Yoongi snarled. The energy of the whole room suddenly shifted as the others stopped what they were doing to watch. \u201cNamjoon told me everything,\u201d Yoongi continued. \u201cYou think you can just abandon your brother when he needs you the most and then just swoop in like some hero and save the day?\u201d Jin\u2019s eyes darted to the others in the room and he swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019re a real piece of work, you know that?\u201d Yoongi asked, leaning in close. \u201cYou\u2019re really just over here flaunting your silver spoon over all of our heads. Making everyone else feel like absolute crap while you\u2019re off getting some <i>fancy</i> degree. Living in your <i>fancy</i> dorms. Coming home to your <i>fancy</i> house. You know, some of us actually have to work hard to get where we want to go? Most of us have to work hard just to get by. And even then, we still fail.\u201d Yoongi let out a pathetic chuckle and wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his jacket. \u201cEverything just comes so easy for you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you even still hang out with us? Why would you want to be around losers like us all the time? Huh? Do you like just holding what we\u2019ll never have over our heads? Is that it? Does it make you feel better seeing how crappy our lives are, <i>Seokjin</i>?\u201d</p><p>A hand clamped down on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and pulled him away from Jin. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, hyung,\u201d Jungkook said in his ear.</p><p>Yoongi spun around to face him. Over the years they\u2019d known each other, Yoongi had watched Jungkook surpass him in height and stature. He was taller, broader, stronger. The boy was a fighter. A survivor. He\u2019d make it just fine without Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, get out,\u201d Yoongi said at last and took another swig from the bottle in his hand.</p><p>No one moved or said anything, none of them really sure what to do.</p><p>\u201cI said out!\u201d Yoongi\u2019s voice cracked on the last word as he raised his voice. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>The others leapt into action then. Jin slipped out from behind Yoongi and pulled his truck keys from his pocket as he made his way toward the door. At the sight of their ride leaving, Taehyung and Jimin dropped their controllers on the coffee table and hurried after him, uttering quick goodbyes to Jungkook as they passed him. Hoseok and Namjoon left silently as well, Namjoon\u2019s gaze holding Yoongi\u2019s as he made his way past him. Hoseok was too tired to even care about the outburst. He hadn\u2019t really wanted to be there anyway and now he was just looking forward to going home and sleeping. The two left, pulling the heavy metal door shut behind them and at last it was just Yoongi and Jungkook left in the silence.</p><p>Yoongi let out a heavy sigh as he placed the whiskey bottle back on the counter then pushed the heels of his hands against his eyes. His head was pounding and his throat burned and he just wanted to collapse into his bed. This whole night had been a complete wreck. He wanted nothing more than to just be alone so he could try and figure everything out. But when he opened his eyes again, he saw Jungkook still standing there with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Yoongi sighed again.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Kook,\u201d he said finally, raking his fingers back through his hair.</p><p>Jungkook furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The anguish that had been haunting him every night for the past week reawakened in Yoongi\u2019s gut and he clenched his fists down at his sides to keep his composure from cracking. \u201cI said, go home,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019m not your parent. I can\u2019t take care of you. You have a family. You have a home. Go there.\u201d</p><p>He wanted so badly to take Jungkook with him to Seoul. He wanted to protect the boy from the world. He wanted to be his home. To be his family. To be there. But he knew he couldn\u2019t and he could feel himself already starting to break apart. <i>It\u2019s what\u2019s best for him. You can\u2019t protect him. You have to let him go.</i></p><p>He wanted nothing more in this life than to not be the cause of the hurt expression on Jungkook\u2019s face. \u201cBut hyung\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get out!\u201d Yoongi screamed and squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cI don\u2019t want you anymore!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s breath hitched and suddenly he was silent. Yoongi didn\u2019t want to look at him. Didn\u2019t want to meet his eyes. But finally he did. And what he saw shattered him completely. The boy\u2019s eyes were glassy, his bottom lip pulled into his mouth. He wore the same dejected expression as the first time he\u2019d run away from home and ended up at Yoongi\u2019s. He\u2019d told him that he\u2019d gotten in a fight with his foster dad. That the man had called him worthless, nothing more than a means to a paycheck. That the minute he turned eighteen, he was out of there. Yoongi had pulled him in. Let him cry against him. Squeezed him tight and told him he\u2019d never feel unwanted again\u2026</p><p>Finally, Jungkook spoke. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi let out a stuttering breath. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d <i>Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. He\u2019ll be alright. He can make it on his own. </i>\u201cI\u2019ve had to give up a lot for you. I\u2019ve had to put my dreams on hold. My future on hold so you\u2019d have a place to stay and someone to take care of you. You\u2019ve been holding me back long enough. You\u2019re not a kid anymore. You need to start taking care of yourself. I\u2019ve done my job. Now you need to start doing yours.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook swallowed hard, eyes drilling so intensely into Yoongi\u2019s that at last the older boy had to look up at the ceiling. <i>Please, just leave. Please, just go and don\u2019t say anything.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just drunk, hyung,\u201d Jungkook finally said and stepped forward to place his hands on Yoongi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re just stressed out and you need to sleep it off.\u201d Then he started guiding Yoongi to his bedroom.</p><p>But Yoongi pushed him away. \u201cI don\u2019t <i>just need sleep</i>,\u201d he growled and turned to face the younger boy again. \u201cI said what I said and I meant it.\u201d Then he shoved Jungkook hard, causing him to stumble back toward the door. \u201cGo home, Jungkook.\u201d He shoved him again. \u201cGo home and don\u2019t come back here.\u201d Again. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here, anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop shoving me, hyung,\u201d Jungkook snapped and straightened up to his full height. The kid was massive compared to Yoongi and infinitely more intimidating. Yoongi swallowed hard but kept his expression the same. This was for the kid\u2019s own good.</p><p>\u201cThen grow up, Jungkook,\u201d he barked. \u201cStop being some weak little child. Stop depending on everyone else. Stop expecting everyone to take care of you and just man up.\u201d</p><p>This set something off in the boy. In one quick motion, Jungkook stepped forward and gripped the front of Yoongi\u2019s shirt in his fists. Fire burned in his eyes and Yoongi could feel the fear rushing through his veins like ice water.</p><p>\u201cYou want to hit me, Kook?\u201d he asked. \u201cThen hit me.\u201d</p><p>With a shake of his head, Jungkook let Yoongi go, dropping him back onto his feet, and he stumbled backward. A pathetic chuckle bubbled up from his throat and he shook his head. \u201cNot even man enough to do that.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Yoongi was wrenched forward again by his collar and he felt Jungkook\u2019s fist connect with his cheek. The force knocked him to the ground and he landed hard on his hands and knees. His mouth filled with the bitter taste of iron and when he brought his hand up to swipe at his lip, it came away streaked with blood.</p><p>\u201cI am a man,\u201d Jungkook said looking down at him. Then without another word, he went over, pushed the door open and glanced back one more time to lock eyes with the boy that had basically raised him. With that, he slipped out, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Yoongi exhaled heavily as he let his head fall back against the floor. His head was still spinning and his face stung and he could feel a trickle of blood dripping down from the corner of his mouth. He\u2019d never felt worse in his entire life. The hangover the next day was going to suck but not as much as the hole in his chest would after what he\u2019d just done. The look of betrayal on Jungkook\u2019s face would haunt him forever.</p><p>Already, feeling a bit soberer now, he could feel the guilt and regret flooding his chest making it harder to breathe. No. He couldn\u2019t do that to himself. This was for the best. He\u2019d already decided that when he took the job. He just wished things could have ended differently. Just wished he could come back once in a while to see everyone. Have them come visit him. But not anymore. Not after everything that happened that night.</p><p>With a groan, Yoongi rolled over and got to his feet. He was supposed to head out in the morning and he still had to pack everything up. All he wanted to do was sleep, but it looked like, once again, this was going to be another exhaustive night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/92db9f47e53bed0af0272d792c6cb531/tumblr_inline_plripwTCSN1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrozkJbhu1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>07. Save Me</b></h2><p><i>You can only pick up the pieces and paste them back together so many times before they no longer fit.</i><br></p><p><b>April.</b><br></p><p>One evening when Jungkook was ten, he and his parents were driving home from the grocery store. This was a weekly occurrence with them. One he always looked forward to because he and his dad would race each other down the aisles. This particular night, it was raining really hard. So hard that the wipers were working at a rapid pace to try and keep the windshield clear and the street visible. The sound, though a bit jarring, was repetitive enough to turn into a sort of rhythm. One that had Jungkook\u2019s eyelids growing heavy until he slumped against the door, face pressed against his palm, and he drifted to sleep.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, it wasn\u2019t to the sound of rain on the metal car roof or the double time beat of the windshield wipers. It was to the beeps of monitors and quiet conversations between strangers. It was too bright. Too white. Too sterile. It took him several seconds to realize he was lying in a bed in a hospital room. And his parents weren\u2019t in there with him.</p><p>The night they were all coming home from grocery shopping, a semi truck had run a red light and smashed into them. His dad had been killed instantly and his mom only lived for another week before dying in the hospital of complications. The crash had put Jungkook in a coma and by the time he came out of it, he didn\u2019t have parents. He\u2019d fallen asleep on the way home from the store and woken up in the hospital two weeks later, completely alone in the world.</p><p>For several months after the wreck, he\u2019d withdrawn into himself, and while he barely ever spoke a word to anyone during that time, the voice in his mind screamed at the heavens, demanding to know why he had lived. Why his family had been taken. Why he couldn\u2019t have gone with them. He\u2019d heard a nurse say back in the hospital that the only reason he survived was because, since he\u2019d been asleep, his body was limp, therefore absorbed most of the impact, unlike his parents who, as anyone else anticipating a collision would, tensed up. It\u2019s why drunk drivers so often walk away from a crash when their victim doesn\u2019t. If he would have been awake, maybe he\u2019d be wherever his parents were too. Maybe they could be together.</p><p>He\u2019d been in the foster system ever since then. Being moved from fake family to fake family, \u00a0temporary house to temporary house so quickly sometimes he didn\u2019t even get the chance to memorize his address. No one wanted a preteen. Once you were past the impressionable age, you were treated more as a guest in the house rather than part of the family. No one willingly took in older kids and teenagers because they wanted to. It was always for the money. At least, that was how Jungkook saw it.</p><p>He\u2019d learned that out of all of the kids he ever lived with, he was the expendable one. The one that didn\u2019t need attention. Didn\u2019t need love because he could take care of himself. Over time, he\u2019d learned to survive. To see his fake family as a provider of the bare necessities and nothing else. He\u2019d learned to never grow attached. To never let anyone in. To never even unpack his things because any day now, his case worker was going to knock on the door and tell him it was time to move on.</p><p>It\u2019s hard not to latch onto the bitterness and let it fester inside you. Especially when there\u2019s such a lack of love in your life. Jungkook shut down, made a bubble around himself of anger and hatred. He\u2019d get into it with his fake siblings, with his fake parents. With anyone that looked at him wrong. He got into sports and started working out as a way to avoid home and clear his mind. He got bigger, more intimidating. People started leaving him alone.</p><p>Then in seventh grade, he saw a small boy get cornered by a group of guys much bigger than him. He didn\u2019t even hesitate before getting right in the middle of it, blocking the boy with his body and staring them down until they backed off. That was the day he met Jimin. The day he figured out that his strength could in fact be put to good use. Jimin introduced him to Tae and it didn\u2019t take long for the two to break down his walls. To show him that there were in fact people in this world that cared about him. That he could care about too.</p><p>When he met the rest of the guys, he found himself feeling angry less often. Smiling more. Laughing even. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d laughed so much. They were his escape from the real world. The ones that kept him going. That kept him sane. He wanted to protect them with everything he had. Protect Jimin from the darkness that enshrouded him at school.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook slammed the front door to his house behind him and slung his backpack over his shoulder. His ears burned under the hood of his sweatshirt and hot tears glazed his eyes, threatening to spill over the moment he blinked. It seemed like more and more this was the way he\u2019d leave. With a shouting match between he and his fake dad and then a slam of the door.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s mom\u2019s car idled on the curb, Jimin sitting in the passenger seat, his eyes following Jungkook as he trudged toward them.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin\u2019s mom said when Jungkook slid into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he uttered and sniffed hard to keep the tears from spilling over. When his eyes were finally dry, he looked up, catching Jimin staring in the rear view mirror. The older boy\u2019s forehead was creased, the corners of his eyes dipped low with concern. Jungkook turned his head, tearing his gaze from his friend\u2019s and watched the houses rush by through the window. Then he felt his phone buzz in his pocket and he pulled it out.</p><p><b>Jimin: fake dad?</b></p><p>Jungkook glanced up again to see that Jimin\u2019s eyes were still trained on him through the mirror. With a sigh, he looked back down at his screen, his fingers typing out an answer.</p><p><b>JK: yea. im fine tho.</b></p><p><b>Jimin: ok</b></p><p>It was obvious Jimin didn\u2019t believe him but Jungkook was an impenetrable fortress that chose when to let people in and when to keep them locked out. He didn\u2019t like talking about his home life, especially to Jimin. The boy had enough to worry about with school and Jiho and therapy. The last thing he needed was to be triggered by Jungkook and his miserable situation. Jimin had always been an empathetic soul, though. And maybe that was why Jungkook had been drawn to him from the start. Jungkook was comfortable around him. He felt understood even though Jimin knew very little. The only other person in the group he\u2019d opened up to was Yoongi.</p><p>Yoongi.</p><p>The older boy had been like a big brother to him. Like a father. A protector. A home. His words still resonated in Jungkook\u2019s head, bouncing around in his skull like a ricocheting bullet. <i>I don\u2019t want you anymore.</i> He never thought he\u2019d hear that from Yoongi. His fake dad had drilled it into him that he wasn\u2019t actually wanted. That they only took in a fourteen year old with a temper because they knew he\u2019d be easier to manage than their younger wards. And money was money. As long as they kept him fed and clothed, they would receive a check every month. He expected that from them. But not Yoongi. Never Yoongi.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t believed he\u2019d heard his hyung right at first. That, for some reason, his ears had interpreted what the boy had said incorrectly. That maybe his mind had been playing tricks on him. But then the words hit him like a sledgehammer to the chest, bruising his ribcage and crushing his lungs. They\u2019d left him breathless.</p><p><i>You don\u2019t want me anymore?</i> He\u2019d had to be sure. Yoongi couldn\u2019t have said it. Couldn\u2019t have meant to say something that he knew would cause so much damage to the younger boy. That would leave him feeling so broken. So worthless. <i>You heard me.</i> And he had. And he heard him for weeks after that. Those words. Those words that pierced him to the core. That extinguished his spirit and left him groping around in darkness.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want you anymore.</i></p><p>Leaving Yoongi\u2019s house that night, he\u2019d wandered the streets for a while, his anger and hurt slowly fading to numbness. And now he only ever felt one of the two. When he was angry he wanted to punch something or someone and when he was numb, he wanted to feel pain. Just needed to feel something.</p><p>He lashed out even more at his foster parents. At the other kids in the house. At his teachers and students at school. He got in a lot of fights. Provoked classmates and rough looking strangers on the streets. He was lucky no one ever pulled a knife or a gun on him. Though maybe he secretly hoped someone would.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay at my house tonight?\u201d Jimin asked once they\u2019d gotten to school and his mom\u2019s car had pulled away from the curb. \u201cFriday night\u2019s pizza night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t turn down pizza night,\u201d Jungkook replied, the corner of his mouth twitching up into a small smirk. Just the prospect of not having to go back to his fake family after school was enough to lighten his mood a bit. Just a bit, though. Yoongi\u2019s words still dragged him down into the icy depths of a dark ocean, but the thought of staying at Jimin\u2019s house at least gave him a chance to break the surface and take in a breath before being pulled back down again.</p><p>School had never really been a problem for Jungkook. He\u2019d always stayed pretty much in the middle academically. Never getting straight A\u2019s but never getting below a C. It kept his fake parents and the teachers off his back which was all that mattered to him. Though now with Taehyung no longer at school as he awaited his trial, Jungkook was having to rush from his classes that he didn\u2019t share with Jimin to meet the boy, sometimes forgetting to turn in his homework or stopping by his locker to grab his books for his next class. He was starting to fall a bit behind and his grades were reflecting it.</p><p>Jiho had left them pretty much alone for a while now. Sure, Jungkook saw him in the halls and sometimes would catch him just looking at Jimin but it seemed like making Jimin miserable was no longer on his agenda. Maybe he\u2019d finally gotten bored of tormenting him. Though Jungkook wasn\u2019t stupid enough to let his guard down, even for a second.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot Tae\u2019s homework,\u201d Jimin said as he walked quickly down the hall toward his locker. He\u2019d been bringing work to Taehyung so the boy would still be able to graduate on time. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t grab it before class. I guess I was just in such a rush. It was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Jiminie,\u201d Jungkook said. He almost had to jog to keep up. The boy was so much smaller than him, how was he covering so much ground so quickly?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been stressed out ever since Tae got arrested and all that crap and now you\u2019re having to work twice as hard and I just\u2014\u201d he stopped in front of his locker, hand hovering over the combination dial. He squeezed his eyes shut with a sigh then looked up at Jungkook. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so weak, Jungkook-ah.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sucked in a breath, words of assurance at the back of his throat when he heard a locker slam a bit further down the hall. He and Jimin turned to find Jiho, by himself, coming toward them. Where were his friends?</p><p>\u201cSo the rumors are true, then,\u201d Jiho said, his dark eyes sparkling as he leaned against the locker next to Jungkook. \u201cYour other guard dog got sent to the pound.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was in Jiho\u2019s face in a second, teeth bared. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Tae like that,\u201d he growled.</p><p>The bully\u2019s eyes widened in fear for just a second before narrowing to slits, a devilish grin pulling his mouth upward. \u201cOr what?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch me. Not here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d Jungkook asked, stepping forward again, forcing Jiho to back up against the locker.</p><p>Jiho let out a dark chuckle. \u201cYou want to hit me so bad right now, don\u2019t you, Pitt-bull?\u201d</p><p>He had no idea.</p><p>Jungkook could feel the muscle in his arm tightening and contracting with each clench of his fist. He wanted so badly to slam his knuckles against Jiho\u2019s skull. Make him think twice before ever even looking Jimin\u2019s way again. He was so sick of seeing the fear, the exhaustion, the misery in Jimin\u2019s eyes every day when he\u2019d come to school. Even though graduation was less than two months away, it still wasn\u2019t close enough. Jungkook didn\u2019t know if Jimin was going to make it. He already looked skinnier than he had even just a month ago. Much longer and he\u2019d wither away to nothing. Disappear completely. All because of this worthless piece of trash grinning up at Jungkook. He\u2019d been feeling so cold, so empty since Yoongi had abandoned him. But now fire built in his gut. Flames licked up his chest. Burned his throat and set his eyes ablaze. If there was one thing he knew how to do, it was protect his friends. And this worm was still threatening one of them.</p><p>He\u2019d had enough.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jungkook,\u201d Jiho uttered so only he could hear. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any teachers around. Hit me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook felt a cold hand on his arm, fingers curling around his bicep. \u201cJungkook-ah.\u201d Jimin\u2019s small voice was barely audible over the sound of Jungkook\u2019s heart crashing in his ears. \u201cCome on. He\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook turned his head to look at his friend. At his tired face. At his pallid skin. His hollowed cheeks. The boy looked like he hadn\u2019t felt happiness in years, yet somehow he still managed to greet him every morning with a smile. How was this boy still alive?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Jimin,\u201d Jungkook said and glanced back at Jiho. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it.\u201d Then he turned to meet his friend\u2019s eyes again. \u201cBut you are.\u201d</p><p>Before Jimin could stop him, Jungkook reared back and threw his fist forward. It connected with a sickening crack against Jiho\u2019s cheekbone, sending the boy crashing to the ground on his hands and knees. A thick stream of bloody saliva dripped from his mouth and he spit onto the linoleum floor before looking back up to meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes. His face split in a wide, red stained grin.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, what did you do?\u201d Jimin whispered from behind him.</p><p>When he turned to look at him, Jungkook\u2019s eyes caught on someone over his shoulder. Principal Song approached with two of Jiho\u2019s friends trailing behind him.</p><p>He\u2019d been set up. Of course Jiho and his friends had planned this. Anything to get Jimin\u2019s second guard dog in trouble and out of the picture.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is going on here?\u201d Principal Song asked, his face red with anger.</p><p>Jiho\u2019s friends rushed forward to help the injured boy up and he stumbled a bit, playing up that he was really hurt. And he probably was. Jungkook had hit him pretty hard.</p><p>\u201cHe just hit me, Principal Song-nim,\u201d Jiho said weakly. \u201cJust straight up punched me in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even pretend you didn\u2019t provoke him, Jiho,\u201d Jimin snapped from behind Jungkook then looked at the principal. \u201cHe was just defending me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Principal Song barked.</p><p>Jungkook hadn\u2019t said a word or moved a muscle since first seeing the man coming toward him. The fire in his gut raged on, leaving his shoulders heaving and his heart pounding. His eyes drilled into the man as his fists clenched tighter. He could feel where the skin on one of his knuckles had split when it came in contact with Jiho\u2019s face.</p><p>Jiho. He wanted to make the boy suffer as much as he\u2019d made Jimin suffer since middle school. He wanted to make him wish he\u2019d never said a word to Jimin. Never laid hands on him. Jungkook wanted to kill him.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit this student?\u201d the principal asked gesturing toward the cowering Jiho.</p><p>Finally, Jungkook pulled in a steady breath to speak. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he told me to.\u201d</p><p>Principal Song opened his mouth but nothing came out. He obviously hadn\u2019t expected to hear that answer and now he flapped his mouth a few more times like a fish, his eyes darting back and forth between the injured boy and the one that had injured him. At last, he gathered his thoughts. \u201cWe have a strict no violence policy here. You were all made well aware of that at the beginning of the year. Did you forget?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook clenched his jaw. \u201cNo,\u201d he said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cSo what made you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been harassing Jimin since sixth grade.\u201d Jungkook said coldly. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>Again, the principal was stricken speechless. It took him just a few seconds to regain his composure. \u201cYou not liking the way we do things does not justify taking matters into your own hands.\u201d Then Principal Song turned to Jiho and his friends. \u201cPlease escort Jiho to the nurse and then all of you get to class.\u201d He waited as they made their way down the hall and disappeared around the corner. Then he turned to Jungkook. \u201cYou know the rules, young man. You\u2019ll need to come with me. Back to class, Jimin.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook watched a look of horror pass over Jimin\u2019s face as the principal took Jungkook by the shoulder and led him away. He craned his neck around, keeping his eyes locked on Jimin\u2019s until they turned the corner. Dread filled his own stomach. If he was suspended, how would he be able to protect Jimin? He turned his head to look back at the principal.</p><p>\u201cPrincipal Song-Nim, you can\u2019t suspend me. Jimin can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe staff will do whatever we can to keep our students safe,\u201d the man replied sternly. \u201cHe will be fine without you.\u201d</p><p>That was it. Jungkook ripped his shoulder out of the principal\u2019s hand and turned to face him. The boy was eye level with the man but more muscular and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a flash of cruel satisfaction when Principal Song took a slight step backward.</p><p>\u201cThis school has done nothing to make Jimin feel safe,\u201d Jungkook growled. \u201cSomething is going to happen to him while I\u2019m gone. Just watch. And when it does, I\u2019m not going after Jiho and his lackeys. I\u2019m coming after you.\u201d</p><p>Principal Song\u2019s eyes narrowed to shining black slits. \u201cThat sounded like a threat, Jeon Jungkook,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd threats will not be tolerated at this school.\u201d Then he straightened up, standing eye to eye once again with the boy. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer suspended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWai\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re expelled.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook could feel the anger churning in his belly like an ocean in a hurricane. His fists clenched at his sides and his jaw became prominent as he ground his teeth together.</p><p>\u201cNow, if you don\u2019t want the police to get involved, I suggest getting off school grounds immediately.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook watched out of the tops of his eyes as the man turned and strolled away and into his office. The whole inner wall was glass so Jungkook could see him go all the way across the room to sit at his oak desk. When the principal was finally seated, he looked up, locking eyes with Jungkook before reaching slowly for the phone. Obviously, he\u2019d been serious when he said he\u2019d call the police on Jungkook if he didn\u2019t leave right then. What else could Jungkook do but go? He couldn\u2019t go back to tell Jimin what happened. He couldn\u2019t return the next week to walk him to his classes. It was over.</p><p>With a defeated sigh, his angry expression fell and his eyes slid from the principal\u2019s down to the floor as he trudged toward the exit. What was he going to tell Jimin?</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook waited at the bus stop across the street from the school until the students were let out at the end of the day. He couldn\u2019t risk being caught on the property and getting the cops called on him, so when he finally saw Jimin coming out the front doors, he jumped to his feet and waited anxiously there on the other side of the crosswalk like a dog at the end of his leash. His eyes followed the boy closely, never straying as Jimin pulled his hood up over his faded orange hair. He watched him make his way across the street, his hands jammed deep into the pocket of his hoodie. Watched him glance his way before shaking his head and trudging past him down the sidewalk.</p><p>Jungkook knew he looked ridiculous trailing after the boy like a puppy but he couldn\u2019t help it. He needed to apologize. Needed to explain. Needed Jimin to stop ignoring him. Please, just stop ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cJiminie, just stop for a second. Please,\u201d Jungkook finally said, grabbing the smaller boy\u2019s arm and spinning him around to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hit him, Jungkook?\u201d Jimin asked. He set his jaw in a hard line, his eyes drilling into Jungkook\u2019s and for the first time, Jungkook actually felt intimidated by his icy stare. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Jungkook looked back at the school again. It was several blocks away now. Jimin had gone pretty far before Jungkook caught up to him. \u201cI just need to tell you something\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin said. \u201cTell me exactly what you were thinking. Tell me why you thought it would be a good idea to punch Jiho <i>at school</i> when you know that they\u2019ve been cracking down on their whole <i>no violence</i> policy, which is a load of crap, by the way, since apparently Jiho doesn\u2019t even need to touch me to mess with me every day. And now, you\u2019ve gone and gotten yourself suspended so what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpelled.\u201d</p><p>Jimin went silent.</p><p>Jungkook didn\u2019t want to meet his eyes. He kicked at a clump of moss sticking up from between a crack in the sidewalk. Stuffed his hands in his pockets and grabbed at the lint that had collected in the seams. Rolled his tongue against his cheek. Until finally, the silence was too heavy to bear and he had to look up. </p><p>Jimin\u2019s icy facade had melted, leaving a stricken expression on his pale face. His lips were slightly parted, his shoulders heaving and then his fingers flew up into his hair and panic filled his eyes. \u201cY-you what?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Jungkook wished he could take everything back. Wished he hadn\u2019t let Jiho\u2019s comment about Taehyung get to him. Wished he\u2019d controlled the fire raging in him. Wished he\u2019d fought the urge to hit him. Wished he hadn\u2019t just uttered the one word that could make his friend suddenly look so scared.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s breathing turned ragged and he raked his quivering hands down his face. \u201cExpelled?\u201d he cracked. \u201cYou got expelled? I won\u2019t have you? I won\u2019t have Tae? Jiho will\u2026\u201d He staggered, almost crashing into the bushes lining the sidewalk if not for Jungkook reaching out and grabbing him. The boy\u2019s skin felt clammy, his whole body trembling. Jungkook had seen his friend have plenty of anxiety attacks but this was completely different. A panic attack worse than any he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Jiminie,\u201d Jungkook whispered as he sank down onto the curb, enveloping the boy in his arms, letting him crumble into his chest as he descended further into panic. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. You won\u2019t be alone. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Jungkook knew he was making empty promises. He wasn\u2019t allowed back on school property. Tae wasn\u2019t going back to school, at the very least, until after his trial and that was only if he was found not guilty. And even then, school would be over anyway. Jimin was right. He was all alone. And it was Jungkook\u2019s fault.</p><p>*</p><p>It had been almost eight years since he lost his parents and the memories, the details, had faded over time. But sometimes, out of nowhere, his mom or dad\u2019s face would appear in his mind with startling detail, leaving him breathless.</p><p>This time it was a dream that they appeared to him in. More of a nightmare, really. He could see the crash happening. Hear the collision. The jarring sound of tires squealing, brakes seizing, glass and metal crumpling. He saw his mom\u2019s terror-filled eyes and heard her scream his name. And then he woke up.</p><p>It took him a second to realize he was laying on the floor in Jimin\u2019s room instead of sprawling across the backseat of a car. A layer of cold sweat coated his naked torso and matted his hair down to his forehead.</p><p>He heard a groan just then and watched as Jimin\u2019s arm stirred where it lay slung over the edge of his mattress. \u201cJungkook-ah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jungkook said sitting up and pressing his palms into his eyes. \u201cJust had a nightmare, Jiminie. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>With another barely-awake groan, Jimin rolled over to face the wall. Jungkook peered at him from over the edge of the bed. The boy\u2019s blankets had slipped off of him in the night and now he lay curled into a ball, his cotton pants riding up his legs to expose his boney ankles. He was so small. Too small.</p><p>Jungkook got up quietly and tugged Jimin\u2019s blanket back in place over his body. The boy nuzzled his pillow, never opening his eyes but letting out a contented sigh. At least he seemed to be having good dreams. With a sharp breath to clear his head, Jungkook reached for his shirt and tugged it on then grabbed his hoodie and slipped from the room quietly.</p><p>The whole house was dark and silent, the place awash in cold, blue light cast by the streetlamp that filtered in through the filmy curtains covering the windows. Jimin\u2019s house was nice. Not super nice like Jin\u2019s, but homey, comfortable. Jungkook felt a stab of jealousy in his gut as he made his way to the entryway where his shoes were. He passed walls lined with photos of Jimin in different stages of growing up. Family photos and birthday photos and school photos. Jungkook hadn\u2019t lived in a house where his picture adorned a wall in a long time. Having been shuffled from one place to the next so many times had made him forget what it was even like to have a place to call his. Sure, he\u2019d been with his current caretakers for a few years now but he\u2019d never go so far as to call those people his family or that house his home.</p><p>After pulling his shoes on, Jungkook unlocked and opened the front door quietly. It was unusually warm for a spring night but Jungkook welcomed the feeling of the wind on his face. He\u2019d woken up with goosebumps dotting his skin and this was the comfort he needed to wash away the image of his mom\u2019s terror-filled eyes.</p><p>He often went for walks when he needed to clear his head. So much had happened that day that this walk was necessary. Heck, the past several months had been nothing but one hit after another. From Taehyung killing his dad to getting arrested, to Yoongi suddenly flipping out on Jin and tossing Jungkook out like a piece of trash. Jungkook sucked in a sharp breath at that last thought. </p><p>He\u2019d made it to the end of Jimin\u2019s street, past the mini mart and out onto the main road that ran through the city. He wasn\u2019t sure where he was headed but it didn\u2019t really matter anyway. He could go on forever and no one would miss him. He already was nothing but a burden on the people that knew him. And he\u2019d let down the only one that didn\u2019t see him as such.</p><p>After hearing the same words for the past eight years of his life, that he was only as good as the money he brought in, that he needed to stop relying on others to take care of him, that he needed to grow up and be a man, it was hard to not believe it was all true. And then there was Jimin. His best friend and the boy that relied on him more than anyone else. The boy that trusted him to keep him safe and he\u2019d failed. Failed at his one responsibility.</p><p>Jungkook cut across the street and around a corner. The school loomed in front of him, its tall, white stone clocktower raising up to pierce the sky like a blade. Jungkook sat down on the bench he\u2019d waited for Jimin on earlier in the day and rested his head in his hands.</p><p>That dream had really shaken him. Had brought everything back. And now the hole in his chest that had finally begun to shrink with time felt gaping again. Without any warning, his chest contracted and he let out a sob. Then the tears came.</p><p>He buried his face in his arms, crumpling into a ball there on the bench as he cried. His voice echoed down the street, filling the darkness with sounds of anguish. He didn\u2019t know how long he cried but when he finally looked up again, his lungs hurt and his eyes burned.</p><p>Jungkook leaned back, resting his head against the back of the bench so he could look up at the sky. The city lights washed out most of the stars but the brightest ones were still visible. Shining and twinkling the way stars do, completely unaware or maybe uncaring of the trivial problems of humans. Stars have much bigger things to worry about.</p><p>With a heavy sigh Jungkook got up again. The air had cooled significantly since he left Jimin\u2019s house and now he hunched his shoulders forward and shoved his hands deep into his pockets to brace himself against the chill. He was exhausted and only now did he regret leaving the house in the first place. It was going to be a long, cold walk back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even see the car flying down the road toward him. The driver apparently didn\u2019t see him either because they didn\u2019t even attempt to slow down before plowing into him. The whole thing happened so quickly that Jungkook didn\u2019t know it until he landed on the road on his back with a sickening crunch. The impact ripped all of the air from his lungs and he lay there for several panicking seconds as he tried to will them to expand again. When he finally was able to pull in a breath, he knew something was wrong. He couldn\u2019t inhale right. When he tried to move his legs, they wouldn\u2019t budge. He couldn\u2019t feel anything. Something was definitely wrong.</p><p>His heart pounded in his chest and he could hear how ragged and shallow his breathing was. His vision blurred with every beat. The air grew thick and suddenly he felt like he was drowning. Panic washed over him like a wave and his unfocused eyes watched as the surface grew more and more distant. He was sinking further. Falling into the dark depths of the unknown.</p><p><i>Please, no. Please, not here. Not like this.</i></p><p>Jungkook could feel himself being tugged further down and he grit his teeth, struggling against current. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn\u2019t fight it. He could feel his energy draining. Feel his heartbeat weakening. The sound of it slowing seemed to surround him until it was all he could hear. Until there was nothing but him, floating in this black ocean, listening to his dying pulse.</p><p><i>Please\u2026not like this.</i></p><p>He thought of Jimin, sleeping peacefully in his bed. He thought of Tae who still constantly wore that haunted look on his face. Of Hoseok and how lifeless he\u2019d become. Of Namjoon and how much he beat himself up over letting Tae down. Of Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cYoongi.\u201d</p><p>The name left Jungkook\u2019s lips in a cracked wheeze. His throat constricted and it took him several more seconds and too much energy to force the muscles to relax so he could breathe again.</p><p>What he wouldn\u2019t give to see Yoongi again. He just wanted to hear his voice. Wanted to hear him assure him that everything would be okay. That he would get through this. That what happened with Jimin wasn\u2019t his fault. Though he knew it was.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to die alone.</i></p><p>A sob broke free of Jungkook\u2019s throat and he took in another gasping breath before plunging below the surface of the dark ocean again. Memories of his life floated around him in the darkness. As if watching silent movies on a projector, his eyes roved over the familiar scenes. Of when he met Jimin, and the rest of the guys. When they had their first beach day. Of one of the many parties at Yoongi\u2019s where Jungkook spent the whole time on the couch stuffed between Jimin and Tae while playing video games. Of the first time he went to Yoongi after his fake dad told him he was worthless. Yoongi pulling him in for a hug, his arms holding Jungkook\u2019s broken pieces together. And finally, his eyes fell on a memory. A memory of him and his parents the night before his seventh birthday when the three of them were making cupcakes and he and his dad ended up getting into a frosting fight.</p><p>He focused on his parents\u2019 faces. On the laugh lines creasing the corners of his mom\u2019s eyes. On the gray flecks of scruff peppering his dad\u2019s chin. These were the things he had forgotten over the years. The things that were so vivid and real to him now.</p><p>Suddenly the thought of dying didn\u2019t terrify him anymore. Now, instead, Jungkook could only feel an undeniable sense of peace. He\u2019d finally get to be with his parents. He\u2019d finally have a family again. He was so close to the edge, he could feel it.</p><p>At last, he opened his eyes. The black sky stretched above him and through the blurry film of tears, he could still make out the stars. Now they didn\u2019t seem like cold, uncaring orbs of light in the distance. They were much closer. So close he\u2019d be able to reach out and brush them with his fingertips if he had the strength.</p><p><i>Kook-ah. What do you think you\u2019re doing?</i></p><p>Jungkook blinked hard and sighed. \u201cYoongi-hyung?\u201d he uttered, his words drawn out and slurred. He could feel himself fading fast.</p><p><i>Just hold on, Kook. Just keep fighting.</i></p><p>Jungkook\u2019s heart rate plunged again, his thoughts suddenly foggy. It was getting harder to breathe. \u201cI-I can\u2019t\u2026hyung.\u201d</p><p><i>Do it for us, Kook. Please. Do it for Jimin.</i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026too\u2026\u201d Jungkook could feel himself drifting in and out of consciousness, \u201clate\u2026for Jimin.\u201d</p><p><i>Bull.</i></p><p>A puff of air escaped his nose in a weak laugh. He couldn\u2019t help feeling a twinge of sadness at the thought of leaving his friends behind. He felt the warmth of fresh tears spring to his eyes when he thought about the moments he\u2019d shared with them. The parties, the jokes, the meals at the diner. He\u2019d had nothing until he met them, and then they were his everything. He couldn\u2019t leave without saying goodbye.</p><p>With his teeth gritted against the pain, Jungkook slid his arm along the pavement, scraping the exposed skin of his wrist across the ground as he reached for his pocket. His energy was draining fast and he knew he didn\u2019t have much longer. By the time his fingers brushed the hem of his pocket, he was breathing hard. Just a little bit further. A choked sob fell from his lips when he realized his pocket was empty. His phone wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Exhausted, he let his head fall to the side, his fading vision landing on the cracked black device sitting next to him. He felt like he was going to cry with relief. His arm was too heavy to lift and for a few seconds he stared helplessly at his phone, the sound of his heartbeat slowing in his ears. But then he pulled in a breath.</p><p>\u201cHey Siri,\u201d he wheezed and then waited with bated breath until at last, the screen of his phone came to life and his mouth nudged up into a weak, triumphant smile. \u201cCall\u2026\u201d Who could he call? \u201cCall Seokjin,\u201d he finally said. As the screen changed, he waited, closing his eyes and letting the sound of the ringing fill his head. It took four agonizing rings before Jungkook heard the sound of someone answering.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s face crumpled at the sound of the familiar voice and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to speak.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Jin\u2019s voice echoed again. \u201cJungkook-ah?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sucked in as deep of a breath as he could. \u201cHyung?\u201d he cracked.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah? Do you know what time it is? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook opened his mouth to respond but instead, a sob pushed its way out.</p><p>\u201cJungkook? What happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d The older boy\u2019s voice rose with panic.</p><p>\u201cI tried, hyung\u201d he whispered letting his cheek fall to the pavement. He squeezed his eyes shut as another cry tumbled out. \u201cI failed. I failed Jimin\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what? Jungkook, where are you? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI failed Yoongi-hyung\u2026\u201d</p><p>On the other end of the line, Jungkook could hear faint rustling sounds as Jin got out of bed and started fumbling around in his room. \u201cJust stay on the line with me. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook took in a wheezing breath as his surroundings began to fade. He tried to keep his eyes focused on the glowing screen of his phone where it lay close to his head. He couldn\u2019t feel his body anymore. He couldn\u2019t feel the cold air, or the rumbling pavement. He couldn\u2019t hear the sirens in the distance or the fact that they were growing closer.</p><p>\u201cJust tell the guys I love them. Tell them I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered as the tears slipped past his eyelashes and slid down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, stop,\u201d Jin cracked. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. Just tell me where you are.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook tried to open his mouth again, tried to draw in another breath but he was too tired. Too far gone. Instead, he closed his eyes, listening to Jin go on, his voice distorting as he yelled into the receiver. At least he wasn\u2019t alone anymore.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5278d232b602c34d39793022179c7c5d/tumblr_inline_plriraA9Do1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp0ciuWY1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>08. Butterfly</b></h2><p><i>Before the gaps are too wide. Before the whole thing becomes useless.</i><br></p><p><b>May.</b></p><p>It had been a week since Hoseok had gotten the call from a distraught Jimin that Jungkook had been hit by a car. He\u2019d rushed to throw his clothes on and swipe his keys off his dresser before tearing out of his house so quickly, the walls trembled with the slam of the door. His poor car could barely keep up with how hard he laid on the gas pedal, the tires protesting loudly around every turn. Luckily, there were no other cars out at this hour because, though he was driving fast, Hoseok couldn\u2019t actually see very clearly through the panicked tears that blurred his vision.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d gotten to the hospital, they\u2019d already taken Jungkook back. He saw Jin first. The boy looked like he\u2019d been woken out of a dead sleep, his face all puffy, his hair sticking out every which way, a hoodie thrown on over his white t-shirt and sweatpants. He was bent at an odd angle over the arm of the chair, leaning into the one next to him.</p><p>It was only when the younger boy lifted his head that Hoseok saw that it was Jimin crumpled in Jin\u2019s arms. He was trembling, his small hands in his hair, his face so red and puffy that his eyes were just dark slits. He didn\u2019t even have a coat on. Just his light blue, cotton pajamas and a pair of shoes.</p><p>\u201cHobi-hyung?\u201d he cracked, his voice breaking.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart dropped at the sound of his voice and he rushed forward falling to his knees in front of him. \u201cWhat happened? Is Jungkook\u2026did he\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Jin said as steadily as he could, though Hoseok could still detect a hitch in his voice. The oldest was trying so hard to keep it together for Jimin. \u201cThey just took him back a couple minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t breathing well,\u201d Jimin added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d His bottom lip quivered and he pulled it into his mouth and shook his head. Then his face twisted in anguish and he fell forward with a sob, his head landing on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Hoseok immediately wrapped his arms around the younger boy\u2019s neck and stroked his hair, whispering gentle reassurances in his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Namjoon?\u201d Jin asked quietly. \u201cI texted him. Figured he\u2019d come with you.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok looked up to meet his eyes. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s working tonight.\u201d Namjoon had been staying at Hoseok\u2019s house now for a couple of weeks and had finally gotten a job doing night shift janitorial work at an office building. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll see your text before\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doors to the waiting room burst open as Namjoon\u2014still in his work coveralls\u2014stumbled in. His eyes were wide as they scanned the room before settling on the three boys in the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked hurrying toward them. \u201cI got a text from Jin-hyung about Jungkook\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in an accident, Joonie,\u201d Hoseok whispered.</p><p>At the sight of Jimin still limp against Hoseok\u2019s shoulder, Namjoon deflated entirely, his face going pale, his jaw slackening. He looked to Jin. \u201cIs he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Jin said cutting him off.</p><p>\u201cWell, did anyone call Yoongi-hyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTae\u2019s trying to get ahold of him right now,\u201d Jin said.</p><p>The four were silent for a while. The almost empty waiting room seemed too cold, too bright, too harsh for the situation. Hoseok wished he could turn all the lights off. He just wanted to shield Jimin from everything. From the prying, mock-sympathetic eyes of the few other people sitting in there. From the sounds of reception\u2014the hushed conversations, the joking banter of the staff just trying to make it through their shift. It wasn\u2019t right. Their friend was <i>dying</i>. Why did nobody else care?</p><p>*</p><p>Jimin had spent all of his free time at the hospital after that. Though they\u2019d gotten word a few hours after getting there the first night that Jungkook was stable but unconscious and that his condition had stayed pretty much the same all week, Jimin still went. Still sat in the waiting room, asking anyone that came out of the swinging doors if there had been any change. There never was.</p><p>Hoseok would accompany him on the days he felt he could drag himself out of bed, which wasn\u2019t often.</p><p>It had been eight months since he threw his painkillers in the bonfire on Beach Day and he\u2019d been regretting it every day since then. The first few weeks were spent in his bed, his skin clammy and feverish as he fought through the withdrawals. He\u2019d tried quitting cold turkey before but had never lasted longer than a week before going back to them. He never thought he\u2019d make it this far. Though if the withdrawal symptoms didn\u2019t let up soon, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. He didn\u2019t know how much more of this pain he could take.</p><p>It had been three years since Hoseok\u2019s accident. Only two months of that were supposed to be with the painkillers and then he was supposed to be prescribed something weaker. But the severe pain lasted and the longer Hoseok stayed on his opioids, the further into addiction he fell, until he couldn\u2019t even function in the morning without first popping a few pills.</p><p>Three years. Three years of wandering through life in a fog. Of never being able to get his hands to stop quivering, and he could feel it, even if no one else noticed. Of pretending that he wasn\u2019t higher than a kite\u2014especially around his friends. He\u2019d gotten really good at faking normal. It had become the only normal he knew.</p><p>*</p><p>Before his accident, Hoseok had been an incredible dancer. He\u2019d been doing it practically since he could walk and he was well on his way to becoming one of the best street dancers to ever come out of South Korea. His path was set. He had performing arts colleges lining up to accept him, scholarships already promised to him while he was still in middle school. A lot rested on his shoulders.</p><p>Then the night before his tenth grade showcase, he\u2019d decided to stay late after rehearsal. He\u2019d gone through his routine so many times, he knew every twist, every pop, every step perfectly, but still he just wanted to make sure. Had to make sure he had it positively nailed. That even the nerves over the fact that there were going to be college scouts in the audience watching his every move didn\u2019t distract him.</p><p>That night ended his dance career before it even had a chance to start. Hoseok didn\u2019t remember falling. In fact, looking back, he couldn\u2019t really remember anything from that night other than staring up at the ceiling in his hospital bed for literally hours, his head set up in an uncomfortable neck brace, and just letting the tears fall. His dreams were shattered the moment he heard the words \u201csevere spinal injury\u201d. There was no hope for a full recovery.</p><p>*</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s mom had been running the dance studio since before Hoseok was born. She used to bring him with her to work when he was just a baby, her students fawning over him, pinching his tiny cheeks and passing him around between them during their down time. As he grew up, he\u2019d join the classes, picking up on the choreography so quickly and so well that when he was finally old enough to be a student at the studio, his mom put him in with the advanced class. Even then, he spent more time helping her come up with the routines and teaching the class rather than being taught. Eventually, she gave him his own weekly slots to teach in. He loved it. He loved creating routines and watching as his students began nailing them, mirroring him and showing his own creation to him. He loved teaching the little, little kids, standing back amusedly watching them completely ignore his direction and do their own thing. More than that, though, he loved in the evenings after the last class had left, when the studio closed for the night and his mom had gone home.</p><p>He\u2019d stay there, just him in the empty studio, the lights down and everything washed in blue darkness. He loved dancing in the dark\u2014in the dim light so he could only catch his reflection in the mirror when he was moving. It made him look like he was a part of the air. Like he was moving through water. A spirit, caught up in the slivers of moonlight for just a flash before he melted back into the darkness again. It helped him to feel the music better. To come up with his intricate choreography. It made him well-known in the city for being such a good choreographer. A ray of sunlight that liked to dance in the darkness. A contradiction almost as beautiful as the way he moved.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cStill no change?\u201d Hoseok asked Jimin after the younger boy had slid into the passenger seat of his car. It was Thursday, and Thursday meant group therapy. When Jimin wasn\u2019t at the hospital, Taehyung was. Together, the two of them made sure that there would never be a chance of missing any new information.</p><p>Jimin looked down at his phone once he\u2019d settled into his seat, his thumb gliding over the smooth surface of his black screen. \u201cI guess not,\u201d he uttered then looked up at Hoseok. \u201cTae would tell me right away if there was, right?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok nodded quickly, not giving Jimin a chance to doubt it even further. \u201cOf course he would,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no news is good news, right? It means Jungkook isn\u2019t getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr improving.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok bit the inside of his cheek. While his youngest friend\u2019s health was staying pretty much the same, Jimin\u2019s was getting worse. Without the protection of Taehyung or Jungkook, Jimin was now fully exposed to relentless tormenting from Jiho. Hoseok himself had called the school and talked to the principal but the man had said that they can\u2019t do anything unless Jiho physically touches the boy. It was like they didn\u2019t care about the fact that this was very obviously affecting Jimin mentally. Had there not been enough stories already on the news and online of kids killing themselves over bullying? Did no one care or even realize that words can do so much more damage?</p><p>Every day, Jimin was stepping onto the battle field the moment he entered the school building. Every day he faced an onslaught of mental assault. High school had become a war zone for him and Hoseok noticed every time he saw the boy that he was fighting a losing battle. The scars weren\u2019t visible but they were deep and they\u2019d be there forever. And no one would do a thing about it unless Jiho touched him.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Jimin?\u201d Hoseok asked knowing full well that the answer was not going to be good.</p><p>Jimin didn\u2019t respond at first. He just kept his eyes focused on the phone in his lap. His bottom lip quivered and his thumb continued to trace circles on his phone screen. Finally, he took in a shuddering breath. \u201cI miss him, Hobi-hyung\u2026\u201d he whispered. His breath hitched. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t know if I can take much more\u2026\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart splintered in his chest and he gripped the steering wheel tighter. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me what would help and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>At last, Jimin looked up to meet Hoseok\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me he\u2019s going to make it. Tell me everything will be okay.\u201d Jimin swallowed hard. \u201cTell me it\u2019ll all go back to normal again.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok closed his eyes and thought back to Beach Day. How could so much change in eight months when the group\u2019s friendship had never wavered in five years? Hoseok couldn\u2019t even remember the last time the seven of them had hung out without it somehow ending in an argument. Everything was different. And after Yoongi had gone off on Jin, kicked everyone out and moved, Hoseok didn\u2019t think anything would ever return to normal. At last, he opened his eyes again, turning his head to meet Jimin\u2019s. He could feel the fatigue keeping his eyelids from lifting all the way. His chest felt hollow and his bones felt heavy. But still, he pulled his mouth up into a smile. One not nearly as bright as the smiles he\u2019d produced in the past.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll all be okay, Jimin,\u201d he said, trying to make his words as convincing as possible. He knew he was lying. He knew nothing would ever go back to the way it was before. But that look on Jimin\u2019s face. That darkness, that dull absence of the spark that always used to light his eyes, that kept him going even though there was so much trying to push him back. It was all so present that Hoseok would say anything to give him just a little bit of hope. Just something to live for. He reached over and gripped the younger boy\u2019s hand. Jimin\u2019s skin was dry and loose, like there was too much of it for his shrinking body. \u201cI promise,\u201d Hoseok added onto the end.</p><p>The corner of Jimin\u2019s mouth twitched upward for just a second, as if that was as much of a smile as he could muster and then he nodded and turned away to look out the window at the students that had congregated in front of the school. Hoseok watched him for a moment longer. He could almost feel the longing Jimin felt as he watched the others interact. It looked so easy. So unattainable.</p><p><i>Please God, let things get better,</i> Hoseok pleaded silently, then shifted gears and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHoseok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom,\u201d Hoseok called back. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d He kicked his shoes off and tossed his keys onto the console table inside the door.</p><p>He heard commotion in the kitchen and followed the sounds until he reached the doorway, then he stopped. His mom leaned back against the counter, a glass of wine in her hand. Just about a foot away, stood a man he\u2019d never met before. The two had obviously been standing closer, doing who knows what\u2014though with the flushed look on Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2019s face, he could take a guess.</p><p>\u201cSeoki honey, this is Seojoon. I met him yesterday at the supermarket.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok just looked at the man who looked back and raised his hand in an awkward wave. \u201cHi,\u201d he said and Hoseok gave him a haphazard smile before shuffling over to the fridge.</p><p>\u201cHoseok used to help me at the dance studio,\u201d his mom continued completely ignoring the fact that her son hadn\u2019t given her new friend the warmest greeting, \u201che was an amazing dancer.\u201d</p><p><i>Is she seriously talking about me as if I\u2019m not even here? </i>Hoseok pulled a bottle of iced tea out of the fridge and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cHis father and I had pretty high hopes for him before his accident.\u201d</p><p>Her words grated on his nerves, feeling like fingernails raking down his spine and he spun to face her. This new man friend of hers just nodded uncomfortably, his eyes barely even sympathetic. Of course he didn\u2019t want to hear about her poor poor son. In fact, he probably had been expecting a lot less talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my room,\u201d Hoseok uttered then left the kitchen before his mom could say anything.</p><p>By the time he reached his bedroom and closed his door, his head was pounding. Therapy hadn\u2019t been something he\u2019d taken seriously in a long time but he still went for Jimin. And because it kept him out of the house for that much longer.</p><p>His mom and dad had split just a year after his accident, saying it had nothing to do with him even though he knew that was a lie. The only thing that had kept them together before that was their determination for their son to become a professional dancer. He\u2019d never even really seen them in the same room together unless it was absolutely necessary. They\u2019d spend dinners talking excitedly about Hoseok\u2019s next show or some new college that wanted him, but then once those conversations came to an end, there was nothing else to say. At least not to each other. They didn\u2019t care about the other\u2019s careers, didn\u2019t care about how the other was doing. It was all about Hoseok. Well, it was all about Hoseok as long as fame and fortune were in his future. Once those dreams went out the window, so did their marriage. It had been a loveless one anyway so what was the point?</p><p>Hoseok hadn\u2019t talked to his dad since the split. He\u2019d gotten a couple postcards in the mail from whatever new place his dad had traveled to but he hadn\u2019t gotten one in over a year. And his mom might as well have been absent. She spent some of her time at the studio and most out with strange men. This was the first one she\u2019d brought back to the house, though. A stranger in Hoseok\u2019s home. It made him sick to his stomach.</p><p>He lay down on his bed and unscrewed the cap from his drink as he stared up at the ceiling. His shoulders were achy and stiff, as per usual at this time in the evening. He\u2019d been taking much weaker painkillers just to take the edge off while he went through his detox, but he found that the low dosage was no longer doing enough for him. And he just always wanted to sleep. He wished he could sleep, but the pain kept him awake. The pain in his neck, in his shoulders, his spine.</p><p>With a sigh, Hoseok reached blindly for the bottle of Tylenol on his bedside table. The pills rattled in the container loudly, almost taunting him. <i>Take as many as you want. It still won\u2019t be enough.</i> He popped the cap off and tipped the bottle toward his mouth. Once he felt four land on his tongue, he recapped the bottle and took a swig of his tea to wash it down. He could feel them scrape all the way down his throat, flowing with the cold liquid to settle into the pit of his stomach like rocks.</p><p>He closed his eyes and listened to the familiar sounds of his room. His computer humming softly under his desk, the baseboard heater creaking as it turned on, the muted ticking of his analog alarm clock. These were the sounds that usually kept him awake at night. He could hear the shower turn off in the bathroom\u2014he hadn\u2019t even noticed it until it turned off, the silence becoming more absolute. Namjoon must have been getting ready to go to work. A couple minutes later, he heard the door open and close.</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Namjoon said to him and he opened one eye to see the younger boy coming out in his boxers and using a towel to dry off his pale blonde hair. \u201cHow\u2019s Jimin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean Jungkook?\u201d Hoseok asked sleepily.</p><p>Namjoon crossed the room to where his stuff was. He always kept his corner neat and tidy. He already didn\u2019t like the fact that he was encroaching on Hoseok\u2019s personal space so keeping his stuff as contained as possible was a must. At least in his eyes. Hoseok had told him time and time again that he didn\u2019t mind him staying. That he, in fact, enjoyed the company, especially, on nights when Namjoon was off and would stay up talking with Hoseok when the pain kept him awake.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, Jimin,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Jungkook is getting all the care he needs. Jimin however\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well, Joon,\u201d Hoseok interrupted and closed his eyes again. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing well.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon was silent for a few seconds then sighed. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok swiped his tongue over his bottom lip then sat up quickly. \u201cDid you see my mom brought someone home?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon let out a chuckle as he grabbed his work coveralls out of his stack of neatly folded clothes beside his pillow and stepped into them. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said as he tugged them on. \u201cI scared the crap out of him when I came home from the hospital earlier.\u201d He\u2019d been there keeping Taehyung company for a couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Tae\u2019s trial is the day after tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Hoseok said. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nervous wreck but that\u2019s to be expected,\u201d Namjoon said as he pulled his work beanie down over his head. \u201cJin\u2019s dad thinks he\u2019ll be able to get him off with a temporary insanity claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never caught, were you?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked down at his hands and bit the inside of his cheek. He shook his head. \u201cTae won\u2019t let me confess. He told the police he did everything himself. If I say anything, it could ruin his trial. They\u2019d throw both of us in jail.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said anything as they both mulled over that last statement. Here Jungkook was in the hospital, Jimin was going through his own personal Hell and Yoongi had ostracized himself from the rest of them, not to mention Jin had basically fallen off the face of the earth having not returned for a weekend from school since going to the hospital that first night. Taehyung and Namjoon going to jail would be the nail in the coffin. The group was so close to breaking, it wouldn\u2019t take much more to completely destroy them.</p><p>*</p><p>Namjoon had left a couple hours before and the sounds of Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2019s awful flirting had finally died down, leaving Hoseok alone in the silence. He lay on his back in his bed, the lights off because even though he\u2019d taken that Tylenol, his head was still pounding. With a sigh, he grabbed his phone off the mattress next to him and turned it on. The screen was bright, sending a spike of pain through his eyes and into his skull. He couldn\u2019t dim it fast enough. When the ache subsided a bit, he opened his chat with Jimin.</p><p><b>hows it going?</b></p><p><b>\u2026</b></p><p><b>Jimin: at the hospital. Something happened</b></p><p><b>Wat is it? JK?</b></p><p><b>Jimin: could you come?</b></p><p><b>On my way.</b></p><p><b>*</b></p><p>Hoseok reached the hospital in record time. Faster than the first night. Jimin was alone in the waiting room, sitting in the chair with his head in his hands. When he looked up, his face was red, his eyes shining. Before Hoseok could take another step, Jimin got up, walking over to him as he wiped his face with the sleeves of his oversized sweatshirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hoseok asked.</p><p>Jimin wouldn\u2019t look at him. Instead, he kept his eyes trained on his fidgeting fingers in front of his stomach. \u201cH-he crashed and it took them a long time to get him stable again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know why?\u201d Hoseok asked feeling weak all of a sudden. He reached out to grab Jimin\u2019s arms, more for his own balance than to comfort the younger boy.</p><p>Jimin just shook his head. \u201cThey have to do some sort of exploratory\u2026thing. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre his foster parents here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were here for like an hour, earlier,\u201d Jimin said with a sniff.</p><p>The fact that Taehyung and Jimin were basically living at the hospital while Jungkook\u2019s fake parents had barely made any sort of appearance over the past month had his stomach churning with anger.</p><p>Finally Jimin lifted his head, a bruise becoming apparent on his cheekbone. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hoseok asked nodding toward it.</p><p>Jimin brought a hand up to rub at the bruise. \u201cJiho hit my locker door while it was open and it hit me in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I see this earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI covered it up.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok raked a hand through his hair. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d claim it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok hated Jiho. Hated him more than Jungkook\u2019s fake parents. Hated him more than his dad for abandoning him. Hated him more than his mom for bringing strange men into their home. He used to get his anger out in the studio. It was the only way to help him work through it. Then he relied on his pills. But he didn\u2019t have those anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, Hobi-hyung,\u201d Jimin said at last breaking Hoseok out of his thoughts.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s face fell. He <i>was</i> tired. Always tired.</p><p>\u201cGo home and try to sleep,\u201d Jimin said and pushed him gently backward toward the exit again. \u201cI\u2019ll call you if I hear anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be alone, Jimin,\u201d Hoseok said.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung is on his way.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok couldn\u2019t tell if it was a lie or not but his skin was crawling and he needed some fresh air. So with a sharp nod and one last reassuring brush of his hand against Jimin\u2019s arm, he left.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to go home. He didn\u2019t want to stare up at the ceiling, his mind racing, his body aching as he tried to go to sleep. He didn\u2019t really know what he wanted. But somehow, he ended up at the studio. It looked abandoned. His mom had been working there a lot less, letting it fall to the wayside. But still, just the sight of it filled Hoseok\u2019s chest with warmth. He hadn\u2019t been there in years.</p><p>*</p><p>The sound of the light switch flipping on echoed through the empty studio. Hoseok stood there in the doorway for several seconds as his eyes adjusted to the suddenly bright room. A wall of mirrors loomed in front of him, his gaze meeting the one reflected back at him. He looked terrified. He felt terrified.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t stepped foot in the studio since before his accident. Sure, he\u2019d spent late nights in his room attempting to move the way he used to be able to, but those times always ended in pain and a trickle of angry tears. Those were the nights he\u2019d find himself reaching for his pills, swallowing more than he needed. The high didn\u2019t fill the gaping hole in his chest, though. The place where his passion had once burned bright. As bright as he was.</p><p>Everyone that knew him before his accident would say he was sunshine in human form. He always had a smile on his face that glowed almost as brightly as his sparkling eyes and his golden skin. He looked like a child of summer, made of everything that was pure and warm in the world. But that light had died there in his hospital room. He\u2019d felt it leave his body, as if his very soul had floated away, leaving him feeling cold and empty. The only light he\u2019d felt since then was the illusion created by the pills he took. Artificial sunlight. Nothing but fake happiness that faded with the high and left him exhausted and miserable all night long.</p><p>*</p><p>His footsteps sounded hollow as he made his way over to the speaker system. He plugged his phone into the stereo and shuffled through his music until he came to the right song. Then he picked the small controller up off the top of the stereo and made his way to the center of the room. For several seconds, he stood there in silence, looking at his reflection. It was too bright in the room.</p><p>With a huff, Hoseok went over and shut the lights back off, plunging the room into darkness. Much better. Then he went back and stood in the middle of the floor. With a deep breath, he pushed the play button on the remote and the room suddenly filled with music. The first time he\u2019d heard this song, he\u2019d closed his eyes to listen, his mind immediately conjuring up a stage, he in the middle of it. He\u2019d created a whole routine in his mind, playing the song over and over, using his imagination to move the way his body wasn\u2019t able to. He\u2019d practiced the choreography in his mind hundreds of times and now that he was here, now that his feet were planted firmly on the waxed floor of the dance studio, the music pumping out of the speakers, it seemed that this was the pivotal moment. He couldn\u2019t go back. He couldn\u2019t fail. If he did, this was really it.</p><p>He closed his eyes, feeling the music rise in him like the swell of a wave. It filled his chest then overflowed, spilling down his arms and flowing through his veins like electricity. Something ignited in him like a spark to gasoline and he began to move to the music. Immediately, he felt a twinge of pain at the base of his skull and he jerked, catching the back of his neck with a tensed hand. He dug his fingers into his skin, standing motionless until the pain finally began to ebb. <i>Take it slow, Hoseok,</i> he told himself then carefully rolled his neck from side to side, loosening up the muscle.</p><p>With a deep breath to calm his nerves, he started the song over. This time, he didn\u2019t try to replicate the choreography he envisioned. Instead, he only barely moved, making small motions with his body as he went over the dance in his mind. When the song ended, he did it again, this time letting his limbs make larger movements, though still smaller than he wanted.</p><p>He did this over and over, feeling the music and letting it take control slowly. With every reset, he could feel his movements becoming more fluid, more pronounced. With every roll of his body, he tensed for the pain but since his muscles were having a chance to stretch and warm up, it wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>He moved through the darkness, the light from outside streaming in through the windows lining the wall high above the mirrors and he watched his form in the mirror, slipping in and out of the rays. Like a spirit dancing in shafts of moonlight. Still not perfect but getting closer.</p><p>Hoseok had lost count of how many times he played through the song. He just kept hitting the back button, losing himself in the music until finally, he collapsed onto his back, his mouth stretched into the biggest euphoric smile he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>Maybe this was finally the end of his struggle. Maybe he could finally dance again. Finally live his dream. Finally leave the pain and the pills behind.</p><p>He was tired and he could hear his bed calling his name. With a groan, he got back to his feet. He was going to be sore the next day. Probably for several days after this but he didn\u2019t care. For once, he welcomed the pain.</p><p>When he grabbed his phone and unplugged it, he noticed a notification on his screen. A message from Jimin. It had been sent just a few minutes earlier. Hoseok swiped the message and brought his phone up to read it.</p><p><b>Jimin: I know you tried. I know youve done everything you could. I know I\u2019m letting you down. I\u2019m letting you all down. But I cant do this anymore, hyung. Living hurts too much. Existing hurts too much. Youll be fine without me. All of you.</b></p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heavy breaths echoed through the room as he read the text over and over. At last he started typing out his own message.</p><p><b>What do you mean?</b></p><p>He waited less than a minute before sending another.</p><p><b>Jimin</b></p><p>No response.</p><p><b>Jimin answer me now.</b></p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s hands shook as his thumb tapped Jimin\u2019s name. An option came up to call him and he pressed it. As it rang, he sprinted out of the studio, not even bothering to lock it back up before making his way to his car. Voicemail. With a curse, Hoseok hit redial and got into his car. The engine groaned to life and the tires peeled out as he flew out of the parking lot.</p><p>He called over and over again as he drove to Jimin\u2019s house, not even wasting a second between calls before hitting redial again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jimin,\u201d he growled and hit redial again.</p><p>Voicemail.</p><p>With an angry cry, he threw his phone to the passenger side. It cracked against the window before disappearing down into the space between the seat and the door. <i>Please, let him be okay. Please, let him be okay.</i></p><p>The house was dark when Hoseok pulled up to the curb and jumped out. Jimin\u2019s dad was on a business trip for the next couple of weeks and his mom must have been out because the door was locked when Hoseok tried the handle. He banged on it with his fists, screaming Jimin\u2019s name until his hands hurt and when that got him no response, he grabbed one of the bricks lining the path and smashed it into the window beside the door. Ignoring the jagged glass, he reached in and stretched his arm as far over as he could until he was able to undo the deadbolt. The door rattled as he threw it open and rushed inside.</p><p>The place was dark and silent and Hoseok\u2019s panic grew as he went from empty room to empty room.</p><p>\u201cJimin!\u201d he yelled. \u201cJimin, where are you? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>His feet hit the stairs, echoing loudly as he took them two at a time. He flung open Jimin\u2019s bedroom door, eyes roving over the empty space. His shoulders heaved, his breath coming out in ragged wheezes and he whirled around again to face the hallway. The bathroom door was shut at the other end.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s breath caught. \u201cNo, Jimin,\u201d he whispered before running to the door. He tried the handle. Locked. He hit his still aching fist against it. \u201cJimin!\u201d He rattled the handle until he was sure it was going to come loose in his hand. \u201cNo no no no please no.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he backed up and began ramming against it. Wood splintered with every hit and his shoulder burned but he kept throwing himself against the door until at last, it gave in, swinging open with such force that it banged against the adjacent wall. Hoseok fell in landing hard on his knees. The bathroom was pitch black and he pawed at the wall next to the doorframe, finally finding the light switch and flipping it on.</p><p>The bathtub was filled to the brim with water, and there he was, a dark form beneath its surface. Hoseok surged forward and plunged his arms into the water, displacing so much of it that gallons spilled over the edge, drenching him and the bathmat before spreading across the tile floor and toward the carpeted hall.</p><p>He clutched Jimin to his chest, the boy\u2019s hair plastered over his eyes, his skin deathly pale, his lips blue from lack of oxygen.</p><p>\u201cJimin,\u201d Hoseok cried shaking the boy. He lay him on the ground and started pushing hard against his chest. He\u2019d never performed CPR before and he hoped to God he was doing it correctly. Though maybe it didn\u2019t even matter anymore.</p><p>After a few pushes, he pressed his ear against the boy\u2019s chest. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jimin,\u201d he grunted then grabbed the boy by the chin and the top of his head and bent down to try mouth to mouth. Jimin\u2019s lips felt cold and dead against his own but still he tried forcing air into the boy\u2019s lungs. Then he started doing compressions again.</p><p>He switched between the two over and over, his hope fading the longer Jimin went without responding. Tears streamed down his face and his own chest was beginning to ache from taking in such deep breaths to give to Jimin, but he couldn\u2019t stop. He couldn\u2019t give up. Jimin had to live. He had to be alright.</p><p>What could Hoseok do? He needed to call for help. He needed to find a phone. His own cellphone was still wedged between the seat and the passenger side door in his car, but he knew Jimin\u2019s parents had a phone in their room just next door. Should he stop doing CPR? Should he keep going until Jimin\u2019s mom got home? Who knew how long that would be? It would only take a second. Just two steps out of the bathroom, two down the hall and three to get into the bedroom and grab the phone. Then seven back. Could he make it? Could Jimin make it? He didn\u2019t have any other option.</p><p>With a silent plea, Hoseok leaned down to give Jimin one more breath before tearing himself away from the boy. He scrambled across the hall, grabbing the phone off of the nightstand and rushing back to start compressions again. He used one hand to continue to push against Jimin\u2019s chest as hard as he could while his other hand shakily dialed 911. Once the phone was ringing, he dropped it the floor so he could use both hands again.</p><p>\u201c911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease help,\u201d Hoseok said, his voice breaking on the second word. He dropped his head onto Jimin\u2019s chest as a sob racked through him. \u201cPlease come. He\u2019s not breathing\u2026\u201d</p><p>Through the anguish, Hoseok lifted his head again and continued pushing on Jimin\u2019s chest. He could barely hear the operator on the other end but he rattled off the address anyway and then went back to alternating between compressions and breathing into Jimin\u2019s mouth.</p><p>His strength was diminishing. His vision tunneling. Everything was fading and Hoseok knew. He just knew that it was no use. He should just stop. Just come to terms with the fact that Jimin was gone. That he\u2019d failed the boy. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop. It was almost robotic by this point. His body was long passed exhaustion but he couldn\u2019t quit.</p><p>A few minutes later he heard the faint sound of sirens approaching and looked up to see red lights flashing on the ceiling from outside the window. Relief didn\u2019t reach him though as Jimin was still unresponsive.</p><p>\u201cAnyone here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp here!\u201d Hoseok yelled, his voice hoarse.</p><p>A couple seconds later, two blurry shapes rushed into the bathroom, one pulling Hoseok away while the other replaced him doing CPR. Hoseok let the paramedic pull him out of the bathroom and collapsed against the carpet in a tired, wet heap. He couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t see. He could barely think. All he could do was breathe and pray with the last ounce of energy that Jimin would wake up.</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Hoseok finally gained enough strength to sit up, the paramedics had already taken Jimin away in the ambulance. Before they had gone, one paramedic had sat at the top of the stairs with him and asked him some questions. If he knew what happened. How long he\u2019d been doing CPR. He couldn\u2019t answer. He had no idea how long he\u2019d been there. Had no idea how long Jimin was underwater. He wished he knew something.</p><p>After a few more questions that Hoseok didn\u2019t know the answer to, the paramedic gave him a small card with his contact information on it and then they left. Hoseok sat in the dark at the top of the stairs for a long time debating on if he should stick around and wait for Jimin\u2019s mom to get home or not. He didn\u2019t want to. He didn\u2019t want to be in the house anymore. He was soaking wet and cold and exhausted and he just wanted to sleep forever.</p><p>His whole body hurt but somehow he still managed to get to his car and drive home. His mom must have still been out on her date and Namjoon was still at work so the house was silent. Hoseok stumbled into the bathroom, yanking his shirt off over his head and letting it drop to the floor. It hit the tiles with a wet slap.</p><p>His reflection stared back at him. His eyes were dull, defeated, unemotional. He felt as hollow as he looked. Every inch of him was tired. His body felt weak. His thoughts muddled. He could feel himself shutting down. He wanted to sleep. Needed to sleep. Needed to just be done with it all.</p><p>Hoseok reached up and opened the medicine cabinet. He stood there in silence, his eyes scanning the rows of pill bottles until they settled on the bottle of Benadryl. His mom suffered from seasonal allergies so she took these pretty regularly throughout the spring and summer. They always made her really drowsy. Perfect.</p><p>He brought the pill bottle down from its shelf and squinted in the dim light at the writing on the label. Disclaimers jumped out at him. <b>Caution.</b> <b>Warning.</b> <b>Danger</b>. None of those words held a negative meaning for him. They were promises. Promises of sleep.</p><p>With unsteady hands, he popped the cap off and tilted the bottle toward his open hand. The pills rained down, some slipping through the cracks between his fingers and disappearing down the drain but most of them collected in his palm. By the time the bottle was empty, he held a pile of small white pills. With one more glance at himself in the mirror, he lifted his hand and poured them into his mouth. It took several painfully dry swallows but he eventually choked them all down. Then he carefully replaced the lid and put the bottle back in its place on the shelf before leaving the bathroom and walking calmly down the hall to his room.</p><p>He lay down on his bed and closed his eyes. Images of Jimin\u2019s colorless skin filled his head. The boy\u2019s lips had been so cold and so dead. He didn\u2019t even look like him. Jimin used to be such a warm person. So happy even amidst his struggles. After Hoseok\u2019s accident, he\u2019d thought his life was over. He\u2019d lost all hope. But Jimin had pulled him up out of the darkness. He\u2019d been the last remaining glimmer of sunlight for Hoseok to cling to. His ray of sunlight. His little Jimin.</p><p>As he released a tired sigh, Hoseok felt a tear slip from beneath his eyelid, drawing a cold trail down his cheek. Without even realizing it, he\u2019d relied so much on Jimin. Relied on his joy, on his positivity, on the promise Jimin made on Beach Day after Hoseok had dumped his pills into the fire.</p><p><i>We\u2019ll help you through this, hyung.</i></p><p>The boy had hidden his own pain so Hoseok wouldn\u2019t see it.</p><p><i>I\u2019m rooting for you.</i></p><p>Hoseok\u2019s face twisted and he threw his arm across his eyes as the despair crashed over him. He could feel his chest tightening, his lungs seizing as his heart hammered against his ribs. Thoughts of the other boys flooded his mind. Images of Taehyung\u2019s boxy grin and lanky arms slung over Namjoon\u2019s shoulders to his bloody hands and haunted eyes. Of Jungkook\u2019s sparkling eyes and playful jabs to him lying in his hospital bed with wires and tubes sticking out of him. Of Jimin. Jimin. Sweet Jimin, golden-skinned and running on the beach to limp and lifeless, his wet, hair matted to his pale face.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t know if I can take much more.</i></p><p>Another sob clawed its way up Hoseok\u2019s throat, shaking the whole bed and he pushed his palms against his eyes. His breath was coming too fast, his thoughts pounding through his head like strikes from a sledgehammer. He\u2019d clung to that last ray of sunshine, that last hope, with white knuckled fists and then seeing Jimin there in the bathtub, watching his body being toted away by the paramedics, Hoseok felt it slip through his grasp. He could feel the light receding, feel it shrinking back like the tide. The darkness was taking over, creeping in like a slow moving poison. Taking over his mind, tinging his fingers black. His stomach was a churning mess. And at his center, a blackhole.</p><p>With one last shuddering breath, Hoseok relaxed completely. The drugs started to take affect and his heartbeat slowed, the ringing in his head, the cacophony of thoughts ebbing until nothing mattered anymore. </p><p>Nothing mattered.</p><p>He lay there in silence, his eyes still covered by his palms and just listened. Listened to his computer humming under his desk and the baseboard heater creaking as it warmed up and the little analog alarm clock on his nightstand. These sounds used to keep him awake all night, along with his racing thoughts and his sore neck. But now he didn\u2019t feel any pain. He was too exhausted to think. And the sounds became a last comfort that lulled him into a deep, endless sleep.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad985a2e4d26543fd87599c5f017cbbc/tumblr_inline_plrisuBP2L1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp0zjHYU1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>09. Love Is Not Over</b></h2><p><b>Present Day.</b></p><p>Jin slams his palms down on the hood of the truck and rests his forehead against the cold metal. \u201cJust, please, God,\u201d he utters. \u201cPlease let them all get here.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t heard from any of them since he left and only found out about Jimin and Hoseok from his parents. They didn\u2019t tell him until he returned because of course they assumed he\u2019d been in touch with his friends the whole time. Were they still his friends? After everything that happened, was there still anything between them? Were they even all still alive?</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s outburst back in March had felt like a punch to the gut. Jin had never held anything over their heads. He never thought he was better than any of them. The fact that Yoongi would say such a thing had cut him to the core. He hasn\u2019t talked to Yoongi since that night. In fact, besides updates from his dad about Tae\u2019s trial, he didn\u2019t hear about any of them while he was in Japan. Living unaware all summer, staying preoccupied with program activities while his friends were suffering at home. It makes him feel even sicker.</p><p>The ocean matches the churning in his stomach and he gulps hard, tears pricking his eyes as he glances down at his watch. Their usual meeting time has come and gone. He turns his head either way, looking down the stretch of empty beach in both directions. No one is coming.</p><p>Jin lowers his head again to rest it against the hood of his truck. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. Everything has slipped through the cracks and it\u2019s all his fault. He should have done more. He should have helped Taehyung the first time Namjoon came to him. He should have been there more for the others. For Jimin and Hoseok, Jungkook and Yoongi. For Namjoon. He knew the boy was sleeping in the gas station and he just let him.</p><p><i>What\u2019s wrong with me?</i></p><p>They were all dealing with so much crap yet somehow they still had so much fun together. They loved him, they cared about him, they laughed with him. He didn\u2019t deserve friends like them. He doesn\u2019t deserve any of what he\u2019s been given in this life. If he could, Jin would give it all away. He\u2019d trade anything to see his friends again. To hear their voices, to hold them close. But it\u2019s too late. He knows that now.</p><p>The wind whips the hair at the back of his head, blowing down the collar of his shirt, and leaving a trail of goosebumps down his back. He doesn\u2019t move even though he\u2019s freezing. He doesn\u2019t deserve to feel warmth. Not when it\u2019s his own fault that the world has grown so cold. He lifts his head, gaze falling on his red notebook, the pages fluttering. With a hard sniff, he picks it up, slamming it shut and trudges toward the shoreline. He stops at the edge, just out of reach of the tide and looks out at the water. In the distance, waves crash violently. He watches them fold into each other in a salty spray, crumbling under the weight of gravity. He feels like crumbling, himself. Maybe he could just walk in, keep going until the current sweeps him off his feet and pulls him under. He could let the sea wash him away.</p><p>Far away.</p><p>He looks down at the journal clutched tightly in his hands. A gift from his parents. They always believed in him. Always knew he\u2019d make something of himself some day. None of it matters to him anymore, though. He doesn\u2019t want to become a famous writer. He doesn\u2019t want to marry some perfect girl and have a perfect family and live a perfect life. He just wants his friends back. Nothing else matters. Not his career. Not his future. Not this stupid journal and everything it represents.</p><p>With a frustrated sigh, Jin grips the journal in one hand and draws his arm back behind his head. He\u2019s about to fling it as far out into the water as he possibly can when movement to his right catches his attention. With a jerk of his head, he locks eyes with Yoongi.</p><p>The boy freezes where he stands about ten feet from Jin\u2019s truck. He looks different. His hair is black instead of the mint green making him look even more pale than he already was. He seems smaller too, though maybe that\u2019s because he\u2019s standing next to the vast ocean.</p><p>Jin can\u2019t think of anything to say at first. Instead, he just stares, afraid that if he makes any sudden movements, the boy will disappear. But then at last, he finds his voice. \u201cYou came,\u201d he utters.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s shoulders relax and he brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s Beach Day,\u201d he replies with a shrug.</p><p>Jin nods before turning and running to him, throwing his arms around the boy. Yoongi\u2019s own arms wrap around him, squeezing him tighter than Jin thought his strength could allow. A strangled cry falls from Yoongi\u2019s mouth, muffled by Jin\u2019s sweater.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hyung,\u201d Yoongi cracks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for everything I said. I didn\u2019t mean any of it. I was drunk and pissed off and tired\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all true,\u201d Jin interrupts. \u201cI\u2019m the worst friend. I could have done more to help. I should have done more. You can blame me. I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi finally steps back, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his coat. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all screwed up.\u201d</p><p>The two don\u2019t say anything for a while, Yoongi looking down at his feet in shame and Jin just watching him because he can\u2019t believe his friend is here. His chest still feels warm where the other held onto him. It still feels like a dream that he\u2019s just waiting to wake up from.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to the others at all?\u201d Jin finally asks. He\u2019s been dreading asking the question but he has to know. \u201cHow\u2019s Jimin? How\u2019s Hoseok? Are they\u2026\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looks up at last to meet his eyes. \u201cWell, uh\u2026Hoseok\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two talking about me?\u201d</p><p>Jin spins around, the momentum swinging his arms too far and causing him to stumble as he turns to face the source of the voice. Hoseok stands there, alive and golden-skinned, Namjoon trailing a bit behind him kicking at the sand, hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cHobi?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s lips curl into a warm smile, his eyes glittering and he makes his way closer, opening his arms invitingly. Jin steps into them, not completely believing that this is real. But the boy is warm, warm as a ray of sunshine and Jin closes his eyes, feeling the calm wash over him. The last he heard, Hoseok had swallowed a bottle of pills, but here he was, in the flesh, alive. Alive and warm and solid. Jin pulls his bottom lip into his mouth and bites down against the tight feeling in his throat.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Hobi?\u201d he asks weakly then pulls back to look the boy in the eye.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s own bright eyes are brimming with tears but he smiles through them and nods. \u201cI\u2019ve been in rehab since June but yeah, I\u2019m doing better.\u201d Then he puts his hand on Jin\u2019s arm and squeezes gently. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Jin nods. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Namjoon says coming up behind Hoseok. He stayed back to give the two some time but he couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>He missed Jin too and it\u2019s apparent by the way he pulls him against him. When they part, Jin looks him up and down. He seems so much more put together than the last time he saw him. His skin looks healthier, the bags under his eyes are gone and his clothes look nice. He looks less ragged, so much more put together.</p><p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d he says to the younger boy.</p><p>Namjoon nods, his dimples becoming prominent as he smiles. \u201cI feel good.\u201d</p><p>Jin nods back then his eyes shift over the boy\u2019s shoulder, looking past him back down the beach again. He\u2019s afraid to ask where the other three are. He wants to know what happened to Jungkook, to Jimin. His dad had told him that they\u2019d won Taehyung\u2019s trial, the jury finding him not guilty by way of temporary insanity and self defense and the boy and his sister had gone to live in the country with relatives. At least he can find some comfort in knowing one of his friends is safe. But not knowing of the others\u2019 fate overshadows that greatly. Slowly, he turns back to Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJin-hyung!\u201d</p><p>Jin spins around, his eyes scanning the beach frantically for the source of the voice. At last they fall on a shape running at him. He can\u2019t quite tell who it is by the blur of tears suddenly covering his eyes but a smile spreads across his face anyway as he watches them make their way down the slope of the hill parallel to the water. And then he feels his throat close up, a sob trying to push its way out when two more figures appear at the crest and quickly start their descent. He breaks into his own run, the wind pulling the tears from the corners of his eyes, his heart hammering in his ears as he nears them. Jin barely has time to register Jungkook\u2019s beaming face before he crashes into him, gripping the boy tight as the force of the collision sends them sprawling to the ground in a tangle of limbs. He manages to choke out only the first of many apologies when the breath is knocked out of him by two more crushing bodies.</p><p>\u201cWe missed you, Jin-hyung,\u201d Taehyung yells in his ear</p><p>\u201cYou were gone for so long,\u201d Jimin adds.</p><p>It\u2019s all too much for Jin to handle and he crawls out from under them, sitting back on the sand and burying his face in his hands as he sobs. Immediately, the others\u2019 hands are on him, their cheeks pressed against his head, his shoulder, his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m s-so sorry,\u201d he chokes out and sniffs hard. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I left you all. I\u2019m so s-sorry I wasn\u2019t there when you guys needed me. I\u2019m s-so\u2014\u201d he lifts his head at last, his eyes meeting Jimin\u2019s. The boy looks different. Good different. His hair is dark, his skin golden, his brown eyes shining brightly. Jin cups the younger boy\u2019s face in his hands. His cheeks feel fuller than they have in a year. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. You\u2019re alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright, hyung,\u201d Jimin assures him with a warm smile. \u201cI\u2019m still in recovery but I\u2019m alright.\u201d</p><p>Jin turns to look at Jungkook. \u201cYou\u2019re walking,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d the youngest replies with a relieved laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve been in physical therapy all summer. Yoongi-hyung came back from Seoul to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>Jin looks back where Yoongi stands with the other two, his mouth set in an amused smile as he leans back against the truck watching them. \u201cWhat about the producing job?\u201d Jin asks him.</p><p>Yoongi shrugs. \u201cThere will be other openings. This was more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMina and I are living on my aunt\u2019s strawberry farm, hyung!\u201d Taehyung chimes in and Jin can\u2019t help but burst into laughter at the boy\u2019s boxy grin that seems to take up his whole face.</p><p>The other three join him on their backs in the sand, dissolving into laughter that\u2019s perhaps a bit more hysterical than necessary. It\u2019s hard not to be overwhelmed with everything. It\u2019s all too much and yet Jin never wants it to end.</p><p>At last the laughter dies down and a heavy silence falls over the group. Jin sits up again, his eyes locking with Yoongi\u2019s. The boy\u2019s mouth tugs up into a sad smile. He still must feel guilty. <i>It\u2019s alright,</i> Jin thinks. <i>That\u2019s all in the past and we can start fresh now.</i> <i>I\u2019ll never leave any of you again.</i></p><p>*</p><p>They spend Beach Day the way they have every year in the past. Together. </p><p>The air is chilly, the wind sharp, but Jin doesn\u2019t even feel it. Instead, warmth blooms in his chest as he watches his friends enjoy themselves and that keeps the cold away. The temperature drops as the sun sets and, as always, they build a fire on the beach by the truck. The orange flames lick at the night air, casting a warm glow on the boys\u2019 faces. They all look happy and it\u2019s the most beautiful thing Jin has ever witnessed. Sure, Beach Day must always come to an end. Sure, they\u2019ll have to get up tomorrow and face what lies ahead but they\u2019re together again. And they\u2019ll carry each other through whatever obstacles they\u2019ll face. And there will be many. Such is life.</p><p>Jin gets up from his spot between Yoongi and Jimin and brushes the sand off his jeans as he makes his way back to the truck. He opens the door and reaches in to grab his red notebook off the seat where he\u2019d set it earlier. It\u2019s so much colder out of reach of the fire and he sucks in a sharp breath through his teeth, bracing his shoulders against the chill as he carries his notebook to the front of the truck and lays it open on the hood. The moon shines bright, casting a cold glow over everything but what the fire\u2019s warmth reaches. And by this cold light, Jin flips his notebook open to the page he\u2019d been writing on earlier and uncaps his pen.</p><p><i>Let\u2019s not be like the vase shattered on the floor. Let\u2019s be stronger than the glue that takes these fractured pieces of our lives and puts them back together. Let\u2019s be the bond that never breaks.</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f8b045db3a6d222d515a10c54991bde/tumblr_inline_plriuagtyO1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp1n1zq81qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>Epilogue: Young Forever - by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSORlND-r3SZhjW7WEt8dTA\">@dimpled-gukkie</a></b></h2><p><b>Three Years Later.</b></p><p>Jin climbs the steps of the apartment building, slowly making his way to the fourth floor. He can already hear voices seeping through the thin apartment walls and into the hallway, filling the fourth floor with the comforting voices of his best friends. Before he can even put the key in the door to his apartment, the one directly across opens. </p><p>\u201cHyung!\u201d </p><p>Jin nearly falls over as a newfound weight lands on his back, a small set of hands wrapped around his shoulders. \u201cWe missed you so much, we\u2019re starving!\u201d </p><p>Jin huffs before pulling the hands away from him and opening his door. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d His voice is teasing, the tone you use when trying to coax a child into using manners. </p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Jimin whines while smiling so wide that his eyes are basically closed, smushed by his chubby cheeks. Jin has to resist the urge to pinch them, happy to see that they are no longer hollow like they were a few years back. </p><p>He pretends to ponder his answer before \u201creluctantly\u201d sighing and swinging his door wide open. \u201cI guess I can make you something.\u201d </p><p>In reality, Jin knows that if he doesn\u2019t make food for the group, they\u2019ll most likely starve or order pizza for every meal. The rest seem to lose all brain cells when in the kitchen if the many near disasters are anything to go by. Jin distinctly remembers the time Namjoon not only burned one of his favorite pans but Jungkook also managed to get potatoes stuck to a plate and defied all laws of gravity. </p><p>\u201cJin Hyung is making dinner!\u201d Jimin yells into the hallway beckoning the rest of their friends to Jin\u2019s small apartment. The first to rush out are Taehyung and Jungkook, which is no surprise as they both never stop eating. Pausing in the doorway, Jin waits for the rest to arrive before sighing as the other two apartments on the floor remain occupied. </p><p>\u201cAre Hobi and Yoongi still working on their mixtapes?\u201d Jin asks as he begins pulling pots and pans out of the cupboards. As a college student struggling to not accumulate student loan debt, all he has to make is an unhealthy amount of ramen. Jin proceeds to pick through his numerous flavors of packaged noodles when the door opens. Before Jimin can open his mouth to answer, Yoongi enters. </p><p>\u201cWow, Jin hyung. Look at you, you\u2019re a true college student.\u201d Jungkook snickers nearly earning him a whack on the back of the head. </p><p>\u201cYah! You should be nice to the one who\u2019s making you food.\u201d Jin chides before pouring water into the pot. He can hear Jimin softly scolding Jungkook to be nicer to his hyung and smiles. Jiminie has always been such a sweetheart. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the mixtape going?\u201d Jin asks Yoongi while filling the pot with water. He glances in Yoongi\u2019s direction while turning off the faucet to make sure that the boy is actually taking care of himself. Yoongi had a habit of throwing his health aside for his music, but hopefully with Hoseok working alongside him, he will take care of himself.</p><p>To Jin\u2019s relief no dark under-eye circles contrast Yoongi\u2019s pale skin, a result of not venturing outside for five years. Yoongi only begins to answer when Jin is once again facing the stove. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s where I want it to be though. It feels incomplete.\u201d The maknaes fall silent listening to their hyung\u2019s worry, not sure exactly how to help since they have no knowledge of music composition. </p><p>\u201cHave you had Hobi listen to it yet?\u201d Jin asks pouring salt into the pot of water and turning on the stove. The faster he can get the water boiling, the faster he can cook the noodles, which means the faster they can eat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not quite sure either though. We just spent two hours listening to the tracks on repeat to try and see what\u2019s off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe you need another voice on your track, hyung? I would gladly volunteer.\u201d Taehyung smiles. Ever since Hoseok and Yoongi created Cypher Records, Taehyung who\u2019s their biggest fan, has been asking to be on a song every time it\u2019s brought up. Secretly, the duo have planned a song out just for Taehyung to feature on, but it\u2019s a gift for his birthday. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought about asking Namjoon hyung?\u201d Jungkook pipes up, munching on dry ramen. They all turn to face him, giving him questioning stares at his choice of a snack. He shrugs. </p><p>\u201cI guess I could ask Namjoon. Maybe having someone not directly involved in composition would help.\u201d </p><p>Jungkook smiles wide, bunny grin on display from the pride of helping a hyung. A few years ago, after Hoseok and Yoongi had begun creating their record label, Namjoon quit his janitorial job in favor of running the business side of the label. Since he\u2019s the only member of the group who\u2019s held a real job, Yoongi and Hoseok thought that he would be best. Namjoon ran everything from promotions to contracts and anything in between. He was the one running the hustle, meanwhile Yoongi and Hoseok were the face of the company. Although some may hate being only known in the background, Namjoon is happiest there. </p><p>Namjoon and Hoseok enter at last, the final two of the group of seven. The boys cheer when they enter and pull two chairs over. They all sit huddled together in silence, the sound of boiling water filling the room. It\u2019s a comfortable silence. The type you get after being with someone for so long, and Jin feels himself relax after a long day of classes. That is until Jungkook starts munching on another dry ramen packet. </p><p>\u201cYah! Can you just wait?\u201d Jin yells exasperatedly. Jungkook pouts in response before slowly putting it down on the counter. </p><p>\u201cHe eats all the time, hyung. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised.\u201d Jimin says, ruffling Jungkook\u2019s hair affectionately. </p><p>\u201cYeah, ever since he started playing intramural sports he\u2019s always hungry.\u201d Tae laughs before taking a bite of the dry ramen. \u201cYuck! How are you eating this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Jungkook mumbles. \u201cI gotta feed these muscles.\u201d Flexing his bicep, he gives it a slap for extra measure causing the boys to fall in a fit of giggles.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah put your muscles away, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d Tae says. While Jungkook focused on becoming a muscle man, Taehyung has been more focused on eating the delicacies of life. Because of his new affinity for food, Tae and Jin have developed a stronger bond through their love of trying new dishes. Although, Taehyung does make sure to eat a handful of strawberries a day; they remind him of his days with his aunt and sister on the strawberry farm after the trial. </p><p>\u201cAlright, children, dinner is ready,\u201d \u00a0Jin says pulling dishes down from the cabinet. One by one, the boys pile noodles into their bowls before settling around the living room. There\u2019s only a small table in the kitchen that seats four, so they sit in a circle sprawled across the floor and couch. They\u2019re all silent, focusing only on eating after a long day of classes and work, until Jungkook starts slurping the remnants in his bowl. </p><p>\u201cDid we adopt a toddler?\u201d Jin remarks. </p><p>\u201cWe adopted two.\u201d Namjoon pinches Jimin\u2019s cheek that\u2019s stuffed with noodles. Jimin\u2019s eyes go wide and a blush paints itself across his cheeks as he turns his gaze away. </p><p>\u201cI think if we\u2019re being honest, we\u2019re all just overgrown toddlers,\u201d Yoongi adds. </p><p>The boys all scoff and he rolls his eyes. Yoongi likes to think he\u2019s an adult. That he\u2019s finally outgrown his childish fears and that he\u2019s become more mature. But when he sits among his group of friends he still feels like he\u2019s a teen, mind filled with wonder and the feeling that nothing\u2019s impossible. It feels like everyday is Beach Day with the boys by his side. Like he\u2019ll never have to be alone like he was back in Seoul. </p><p>\u201cThat would explain why I saw Jin throw his psychology textbook across the room yesterday and throw a tantrum,\u201d Hoseok says. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand! I have to memorize all the Psychosocial Stages. There\u2019s too many to remember,\u201d Jin whines, glaring at the textbook lying on the coffee table. </p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about going back to creative writing? I feel like you were happier then,\u201d Hoseok responds. </p><p>\u201cNo, I like psychology. It\u2019s just a much harder subject. I think with psych I\u2019ll be able to actually help people. I can save them from what you all went through. I can almost make up for not being there.\u201d The boys fall silent, each face more stoic than the next. Jin rubs his hands together nervously. </p><p>\u201cWe forgave you a long time ago. You don\u2019t need to do this to pay us back.\u201d Namjoon reaches over to give a comforting squeeze on Jin\u2019s arm. </p><p>\u201cI-I know. I want to do this, though. Besides, if you ever do need me again, I\u2019ll be able to help.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell we appreciate it, hyung.\u201d Hoseok smiles. \u201cOn a less serious note, I\u2019ve rented my mom\u2019s old studio. I was thinking of holding dance lessons when I\u2019m not helping Yoongi hyung in the studio.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them!\u201d Jimin yells. Ever since getting into college, Jimin has been trying to bulk himself up. He wants to be able to defend himself and not have to rely on Jungkook and Taehyung to save him. He doesn\u2019t want to have guard dogs anymore; he just wants them to be his friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them too!\u201d Taehyung yells from the kitchen, digging around the fridge for the carton of strawberries he keeps hidden. </p><p>\u201cHow about we all take them? Hobi can get some practice in teaching unskilled students and we can learn how to dance. I\u2019d like to not look like the inflatable long-limbed man outside of car dealerships.\u201d Namjoon chuckles. </p><p>\u201cBold of you to assume I don\u2019t know how to dance,\u201d Jin says. </p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Namjoon retorts. </p><p>\u201cNot the point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell if we\u2019re mentioning new stuff we\u2019re doing, I\u2019ve decided to get into photography,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cI\u2019d like to capture the good moments of my life so I can forget the bad.\u201d \t</p><p>Jungkook looks at Taehyung before quietly saying, \u201cstill getting the nightmares?\u201d </p><p>Taehyung nods. \u201cThey\u2019re not as frequent but every now and then I get them. They just stay with me a while. I think surrounding myself with physical copies of happy memories would help in keeping them from plaguing my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take one right now?\u201d Jimin suggests and Tae nods enthusiastically before dashing towards his apartment. </p><p>When he returns, a large camera is in his hand and he sets it on top of Jin\u2019s psychology textbook. It\u2019s so thick that it puts the camera at least two inches above the coffee table. </p><p>After about two minutes of Taehyung yelling: \u201cmove left, no my left!\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re too far, you\u2019re only half a body now\u201d, \u201cJimin you can\u2019t sit in the back no one can see you\u201d, everyone fits the frame. Setting on the self timer, Taehyung launches himself across the laps of Jimin, Hoseok, and Yoongi who\u2019re all sitting in front since they\u2019re the smallest. They let out small huffs but still hug Taehyung to their bodies. The flash goes off and they all clamber back towards the camera to see the photo. </p><p>Thankfully, each boy is in frame and no one was accidentally decapitated. Staring at the photo, with the boys wrapped together in a tight hug, Jin feels warm. This right here is his family. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s not by blood or that they split apart at one moment, because Jin knows they\u2019ll always fall back together. They\u2019re like magnets, no matter how far they pull away, they\u2019ll always reconnect eventually.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"208\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ce66b521ba7c779ff02ec2ad756876a/tumblr_inline_plriy8h5v01qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"208\"></figure></p>",

Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment In Life</b></h2><p>Jin stands on the beach, arms resting on the hood of his truck as he stares out at the ocean. The bitter wind whips his hair in his eyes and fills his head with the smells of salt and seaweed. You\u2019d never know it\u2019s the end of \u00a0summer. The sky is an anemic gray, the water dull and choppy. Its chaotic churning matches the whirlwind in his stomach. His fingers shake and he can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from the cold or the anxiety that seems to pulse through him like a live wire.</p><p>He\u2019s been gone all summer, doing a program abroad in Japan and he\u2019s supposed to start his third year of university in just a couple weeks. But here he is on the beach because they always meet up here. It\u2019s tradition. Every summer they mourn/celebrate the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. They spend the day at the beach, goofing off, having a big bonfire and staying out all night. It\u2019s always been like this. All seven of them, together every year. Even though they hang out all season, the annual end of summer beach day seems almost like a reunion of sorts.</p><p>But after everything that happened\u2026will any of them even show up? Jin feels the blood drain from his face as the terrible thought he\u2019s been trying to avoid suddenly appears in his mind. Will anyone <i>not</i> show up?</p><p>With a quick clench of his fists, he pushes off his truck and runs his hands through his hair. He\u2019s been absent this summer, even before then he was going to school full-time and was really only able to see his friends on the weekends and some holidays. And with how little he saw them, they all seemed worse every time he came around. There was nothing subtle about the change in each of their lives. And nothing he could do to help them. He watched each of them slip further and there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>There was nothing he could do.</p><p>With each passing week, the gap between he and the others grew and before too long, he felt like an outsider, a fly on the wall observing rather than being a part of it. And then that whole thing with Yoongi. With Tae and his dad. And Jungkook and Jimin\u2026and Hoseok\u2026</p><p>He sucks in a sharp breath, his heart clenching like a cold fist in his ribcage as he stumbles to the cab of his truck and throws the door open. He rummages for a few seconds through the food wrappers and trash on the floor on the passenger side before finding his red notebook. Then he slams the door shut again, drops the journal open on the hood and begins to write.</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>Do you remember how it used to be? How we fit like a seven piece puzzle? Chaotic and messy on our own but a perfect picture when we were together\u2026</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e1e64d5e71c4589422ce26aed1d979e/tumblr_inline_plrieo6tIs1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp3xbm2p1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>02. Hold Me Tight</b></h2><p><i>We were nothing until we became something. And we were only something when we were with each other.</i></p><p><b>One Year Ago.</b></p><p>Kim Seokjin sat in the bed of his truck, back against the cab, his red journal propped up on his legs as he scratched his pen across the lined paper. He\u2019d always loved writing. It was why he\u2019d decided to become an english major. This notebook had been a gift from his parents, inexpensive but meaningful. A symbol of their support of him pursuing a passion with little promise of fame or fortune. He didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s what he loved.</p><p>Every so often, he lifted his eyes from the page and stared out at the ocean. At the expanse of sea, glittering in the sunlight. Beach day was always his favorite day. Sure, it signaled the end of the summer, and the air, though still warm, carried the faintest bite of autumn, but it was a day for him to spend with his six best friends. The ones that he\u2019d shared his life with for the past five years. Sure, his friendship with them looked different now than it did back then. Life had been a harsh beast, threatening many times to rip them apart but they always prevailed and their bond had become stronger every time because of it.</p><p>\u201cJin-hyung!\u201d</p><p>Jin tore his eyes from the water to look further down the beach and a smile spread across his face when he saw two obscured figures making their way toward him. One tall and lanky, the other shrouded in a black hoodie. Namjoon and Taehyung.</p><p>He climbed out of the bed of his truck and tensed his body as the two younger boys reached him and lunged, each throwing their arms around him and causing him to stumble back.</p><p>\u201cYah!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019d think we haven\u2019t seen each other in a decade.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung smiled, his mouth shaping into a rectangular grin that the rest of the boys had come to love. \u201cAnother year, another Beach Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019re off to school again tomorrow,\u201d Namjoon added mussing up the older boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>Jin ducked out from beneath his arm and patted his hair back into place. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m moving across the country. I\u2019ll still be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch less though,\u201d Taehyung said. \u00a0Jin\u2019s eyes lingered on the ugly purple bruise blooming around the boy\u2019s left eye, at the cut on his lip that split open when he had smiled. With a quick swipe of his sleeve, Taehyung wiped the blood away that had welled up. How many stains were hidden by the dark fabric of his black hoodie?</p><p>The three of them heard more shouts and laughter and turned to find their other four friends running toward them, hair and clothes whipping in the harsh wind. A few more yards and the seven of them were together again, as it should be. As it always should be.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah\u201d Taehyung yelled to the youngest boy as he flung his arms around him. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother!\u201d Jungkook yelled back and dramatically threw his body against him in a crushing hug. \u201cWhere have you been all my life?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked again to Jin. \u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cJungkook-ah gets it.\u201d</p><p>Jin could only laugh as he watched the hug turn into a power struggle in the sand. The wrestling match quickly became a dog pile as Jimin, the third youngest, jumped on top, followed by Hoseok and finally the second oldest, Yoongi. Namjoon, more of a lover than a fighter, stood back with Jin, arms folded across his chest as he looked fondly down at their friends.</p><p>They spent the day together there on the empty beach. Seven friends drawing messages in the sand, racing each other along the shore, eating junk, wrestling and laughing, their normal lives forgotten, washed away by the crashing waves. By the time the sun was setting, their throats hurt from screaming, their limbs ached, their eyes burned but it was the happiest they\u2019d been all year. It was a day to forget the present and live in the good times of the past and the possibilities of the future.</p><p>It grew dark. Not pitch dark. A bright darkness that made the sky a cobalt blue and everything else a crisp black. All they could smell was the tang of sea salt, all they could hear was the breaking of waves as they all lay in the sand and looked up at the stars. The world seems to spin a bit slower at night. The temperature had plunged when the sun set and when they finally couldn\u2019t stand the cold anymore, they built a bonfire right there on the beach.</p><p>For hours the seven of them joked around, brought up funny memories, burst into song and played games, the punishment always the same, taking a dip in the frigid ocean. Before long, all of them were damp, their hair plastered to their foreheads in wet, salty strands. At last, sleepiness began to settle over the group, sending them all into silence. No one wanted to acknowledge that Beach Day was coming to a close. Everyone dreaded returning to the real world the next day.</p><p>After several minutes of silence passed, Hoseok finally sucked in a sharp breath and got to his feet. \u201cI brought something,\u201d he said digging into his pocket. When he pulled his hand back out, it was wrapped around a plastic baggie of pills. The rest of the group watched with bated breath. \u201cI feel like this is a good moment to start over,\u201d he said as he watched the flames lick at the cold air. \u201cAnd what\u2019s a better way to start over than getting rid of the temptation entirely, right?\u201d His eyes lifted to peer around the circle. The others nodded, a few of them giving him small smiles of cautious encouragement. The boy had been struggling with addiction for years. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d decided to quit cold-turkey. But they all clung to the hope that it was the last.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help you through this, hyung,\u201d Jimin said with a determined nod. Hoseok smiled back, his eyes glittering at the promise.</p><p>Then with his own definitive nod, he opened the baggie and turned it upside down over the fire. The others cheered as his smile became wider. At last he stuffed the empty bag back in his pocket and fell back down into the sand. Yoongi clapped him hard on the back and Jimin leaned into him, nuzzling his side until he lifted his arm and slung it over the younger\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Jin smiled from where he leaned against the tailgate of his truck, his eyes scanning his circle of friends. The next morning he was heading off to college. Sure, his dorm wasn\u2019t far and he planned on coming home on the weekends but\u2026</p><p>His eyes flew to the dark bruise on Taehyung\u2019s face, to the pale, sallowness of Jimin\u2019s cheeks, to the threadbare places on Namjoon\u2019s old clothes, to the dark stress circles under Yoongi\u2019s eyes, to Jungkook wearing Yoongi\u2019s sweatshirt providing him the comfort he doesn\u2019t often receive at home</p><p>\u2026he couldn\u2019t help but worry about them. They had a much rougher life than he did and though he did what he could to help, he was afraid that life was getting the best of them. And there was only so much he could do to try and keep their heads above water before he too might sink and they all would drown.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b01174d4d534042dd630624274c053fe/tumblr_inline_plrii1jMao1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrovgkPsj1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>03. Autumn Leaves</b></h2><p><i>Apart, we were fragmented but together, we were unbreakable. And that was all we needed. Until it wasn\u2019t.</i></p><p><b>November.</b><br></p><p>School had always been hard for Park Jimin. Luckily, the fact that Jungkook and Taehyung were almost constantly by his side made it bearable. They were his best friends and protectors against those that liked to pick on him because of how small he was. It wasn\u2019t his fault that when the other boys hit puberty, they sprung up like weeds while he stayed closer to the ground. Though the taunting, the name calling, the abuse, made it feel to him like it was his fault. Like he should have tried harder, thought bigger, been stronger.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to feel good enough when the world tells you that you never will be. Even the medication didn\u2019t help much. The constant taunting throughout the years had worn him down. Chipped away at his meager self-confidence until there was nothing left to help but a razor blade and a bottle of sleeping pills. That didn\u2019t work. And after he\u2019d gotten out of the hospital and gone through treatment and promised his parents he\u2019d continue going to therapy and taking his anti-depressants, he turned to the one thing he wasn\u2019t too weak to control. Food. Everyone else already thought he was small. Maybe if he made himself small enough, he could just disappear entirely. If nothing else, the smaller the target, the harder it is to hit.</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook and Taehyung were like his fortress walls. Taehyung already dealt with his alcoholic father so fighting off a few bullies at school was nothing to him, and the stress of being in foster care had driven Jungkook to the school\u2019s weight room and onto the field so just his appearance was intimidating enough to keep others away. \u00a0There were still the whispers though. They\u2019d seep into Jimin\u2019s head, constantly reminding him that if anyone ever found the chink in his armor, he was done for. Living in constant fear was exhausting.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s parents had gone to the principal about it but he said nothing could be done if it wasn\u2019t happening on school grounds. And of course, bullies are smart. They\u2019d taunt him in the halls and then wait in the shadows to pounce. They\u2019d only gotten to him once before, a day that Taehyung was in the hospital with a broken arm and Jungkook had to stay after for detention, and after that, his parents started picking him up. They\u2019d talked of homeschooling him but couldn\u2019t make it work. But Jimin assured them, as long as he had Taehyung and Jungkook, he\u2019d be okay.</p><p>And so the three of them were a unit. You rarely saw one without the other two. They\u2019d worked it out with the principal for at least one of them to be in every class with him. It had been that way since middle school. Now here they were their senior year. It was nearing the end of November now with no incidences so far. Only seven more months to graduation. \u00a0Jimin could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to the guidance counselor about your dad?\u201d Jimin asked Taehyung as they sat together in the cafeteria. The taller boy had come to school that morning sporting a new blackening bruise on his cheekbone.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head and stuffed a piece of broccoli into his mouth. \u201cYou saw what the principal did about your situation. You think a teacher is going to be able to do anything about mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could always come home with you one day,\u201d Jungkook said as he sat down in front of his tray. \u201cThe two of us could give him a taste of his own medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Taehyung uttered. \u201cIt\u2019s better not to provoke him. He doesn\u2019t get like this very often. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Jimin and Jungkook exchanged knowing glances. \u201cNot very often\u201d had turned into Taehyung sporting a new cut or bruise every week. It was getting worse and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay at my house tonight,\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head and pushed a pea around his tray with the tines of his fork. \u201cNo, Mina is going to be home tonight and it\u2019s best if I\u2019m there too. You know, to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jungkook cut him off.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s younger sister spent most nights at her friends\u2019 houses, luckily she was popular and had a lot of friends to be able to do this with. But on those nights where she was home, Taehyung always made sure to be there, just in case their dad decided to drink. Jimin remembered Taehyung staying at his house one night back in middle school and the next day at school seeing Mina with a black eye. His friend swore to never leave her home alone again after that and he\u2019d kept that promise.</p><p>\u201cBetter eat your vegetables so you can grow big and strong.\u201d Jimin looked up to see Jiho and a few of his friends sitting at the table across the aisle. The guy hadn\u2019t gone one day without tormenting him since sixth grade.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think midgets can grow big and strong,\u201d his friend, Kijung, retorted from beside him.</p><p>The rest of the table laughed while Jiho stared directly into Jimin\u2019s eyes, a vicious smirk on his lips.</p><p>Jimin quickly looked away again, a shudder running down his spine. \u201cDid either of you finish your calculus homework from last night?\u201d he asked as he grabbed his backpack off the bench next to him and began digging into it.</p><p>Jungkook and Taehyung ripped their eyes away from the other table and locked on each other, forks hovering just outside their mouths. Of course they didn\u2019t do it. With a roll of his own eyes, Jimin pulled out his text book and opened it to the assigned pages. He\u2019d been using his homework as a bookmark and now laid it on the table for the two to see. He ran a hand through his newly dyed orange hair as Jungkook and Taehyung fumbled with their own backpacks and searched for their notebooks so they could copy down his work.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would you do without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably fail math,\u201d Jungkook uttered and pulled the smaller boy\u2019s homework closer to him so he could hastily scribble down the answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the brains, you got the brawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I get?\u201d Taehyung asked looking up with his mouth full of rice.</p><p>Jimin looked down at his barely touched tray of food, over to Jungkook\u2019s somewhat normal sized lunch and then to Taehyung\u2019s tray piled high with everything on the line. He smiled fondly. \u201cThe appetite,\u201d he finally said before picking up a piece of melon and nibbling off a corner.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to stay over tonight?\u201d Jungkook asked Taehyung as the three of them made their way out of the school.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll call you if anything changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I used up my minutes for this month and Fake Dad refuses to buy me more.\u201d He always referred to his foster family as his fake family. Fake Mom, Fake Dad, Fake Brother 1, Fake Brother 2\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m hanging out with Yoongi-hyung though after this so just call him if you need to reach me.\u201d Then he brought up a hand to shield his eyes from the sun. \u201cJimin-ah, isn\u2019t your mom picking you up today?\u201d Jungkook asked, his eyes scanning the row of cars that were idling on the curb.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s own head moved along before his gaze settled on a dull, yellow hatchback. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Thursday,\u201d he said and lifted an arm to wave at the driver. \u201cHobi-hyung and I have group therapy.\u201d</p><p>An arm stuck up from the opposite side, hanging out the driver\u2019s side window and Jimin hitched his backpack higher on his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow,\u201d he said to his friends before jogging over to Hoseok\u2019s car and slipping into the passenger seat. Then with a horrible grinding sound of metal on metal and a shudder, the car pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, hyung?\u201d Jimin asked as he positioned his backpack on the floor between his feet.</p><p>\u201cJust fine, kid,\u201d Hoseok replied gripping the wheel with white knuckles.</p><p>It had been a few months now since Beach Day when the other six had witnessed him dump his pills into the bonfire, but even now he looked like he was feeling the lingering effects of withdrawal. Dark circles stained the skin under his eyes and his complexion looked pallid. Not at all the usual golden color. The boy who was normally a perfect depiction of sunshine, had become overcast. He looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping at night?\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>Hoseok glanced at himself in his rearview mirror and immediately straightened up. As if he could hide what Jimin had already picked up on. \u201cA bit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Obviously the boy didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Jimin had told him he\u2019d be there to help in any way that he could but how could he if Hoseok refused to let him?</p><p>The two had been friends for five years but really bonded in the hospital while Jimin was recovering from his suicide attempt and Hoseok was going through his latest bout of rehab. They\u2019d connected immediately, both lost souls having been seeking comfort in the wrong things. Going to group therapy together and encouraging each other in their battles with their demons had brought them closer together. And then when they both had finished inpatient treatment, they stayed close. Sure, Jimin had Jungkook and Taehyung but he\u2019d always have a special connection with Hoseok. He was the older brother Jimin had always needed. It was hard seeing his hyung struggling so much. He hated when any of his friends were hurting. None of them deserved it.</p><p>With his lip caught between his teeth, he pulled his phone out of the side pocket of his backpack, opening a text conversation with Yoongi.</p><p><b>Party at ur place tmrrw? Hobi needs us</b></p><p><b>Yoongi: Sounds good. Spread the word</b></p><p><b>thnks hyung</b></p><p><b>Yoongi: Np</b></p><p>*</p><p>After group therapy, Hoseok brought Jimin back to his house, pulling up to the curb and putting it in park. The two sat in silence for several seconds as the engine idled, Jimin chewing on the inside of his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIs it true, hyung?\u201d he finally asked quietly. \u201cIs the pain really back?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok drummed this thumbs against the steering wheel, his eyes glued to the dash. His pale lips pressed into a thin line and he gave a sharp nod. He looked ragged. More so than Jimin had seen him in a long time. Or maybe he just hadn\u2019t noticed. Hadn\u2019t noticed the stress lines creasing his young face. Or the way his mouth turned down. Or how his shoulders slumped forward as if his struggles were literally crushing him under their weight. Jimin felt the guilt like a fist grab his stomach and twist hard.</p><p>When they\u2019d first met, Hoseok was an incredible dancer. The guys had all gone to a couple of his shows and even as a high schooler, his moves had been impressive. Jimin always loved the idea of dancing but felt it would just be another thing to add to the long list of things he was bullied for. The last thing Jiho needed was more material.</p><p>And then, one night during rehearsal, Hoseok had tripped backward off the stage, falling several feet to the auditorium floor and landing on his neck. He\u2019d suffered a pretty bad spinal injury and the doctors weren\u2019t even sure if he\u2019d ever be able to walk again. Luckily, he regained his ability over the course of a few weeks, but the pain lingered in his neck and spine. He began to rely on pills to help but he kept taking them even after the pain finally subsided. The guys had gotten used to him being high. In fact, if he wasn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t Hoseok. He was a zombie, a shell, lifeless and hollow. But with the pills, he was full of energy, down for anything. Fun.</p><p>After throwing the pills in the fire during Beach Day, he\u2019d gone through the initial withdrawal period. Every time Jimin saw him, he looked like death, but as time went on, he began to resemble the Hoseok they knew before all of this. The one that could be happy and hyper without the high. But maybe it had been an act. An exhausting act, but one nonetheless. And now the pain was back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go back to the pills again, are you, hyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be disappointed in me?\u201d Hoseok asked, finally looking over at him. The sadness in his eyes said it all. He\u2019d been fighting hard, suffering in silence for several months and now he looked ready to give it all up.</p><p>Jimin lifted his hand and put it over the older boy\u2019s where they rested on the steering wheel. His fists were clenched so tight, they felt like steel under Jimin\u2019s own soft palm.</p><p>\u201cI would never be disappointed in you, hyung,\u201d he replied, keeping his voice steady and strong so Hoseok knew he meant every word. \u201cYou could completely relapse and I\u2019d never be disappointed in you. Recovery is hard. Addiction is hard. We have bad days and we have worse days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days are unbearable,\u201d Hoseok whispered. \u201cI know our therapist says to take it a day at a time but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget what the therapist said,\u201d Jimin interrupted. \u201cIf taking it a day at a time is too much, then take it an hour at a time. Or a minute or a second. As long as you make an effort, you\u2019re winning, hyung. And we\u2019re all rooting for you. I\u2019m rooting for you.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s grip on the steering wheel loosened under Jimin\u2019s hand and the boy looked at him. A spark flashed through his tired eyes. Something like determination. A newfound desire to keep going. \u201cThanks, Jimin,\u201d he uttered and gave him a weak smile before looking away and sniffing hard.</p><p>Jimin gave the older boy\u2019s hands a quick squeeze before pulling his own back and snatching his phone up out of his lap. His fingers danced across the screen as he typed.</p><p><b>party tonite?</b></p><p><b>\u2026</b></p><p><b>JK: alredy here</b></p><p><b>T: Mina\u2019s gone. i\u2019m down</b></p><p><b>NJ: see u then</b></p><p><b>Y: </b>\ud83d\udc4d</p><p><b>J: Leaving now.</b></p><p>Hoseok glanced down at his phone where it rested in the cupholder, the screen lit up with the group message. Jimin\u2019s breath hitched when he saw the corners of the boy\u2019s mouth twitch upward then he watched as Hoseok shifted the car back out of park and glanced over his shoulder to check for other cars.</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2019s?\u201d he asked.</p><p>With a smile, Jimin unlocked his phone again so he could let his mom know he would be home later. She sent back a thumbs up and a heart as they turned at the end of the street and headed toward Yoongi\u2019s place.</p><p>*</p><p>The second oldest of the group lived in a cluster of train cars in a yard near the river. He\u2019d made a sort of deal with the owner a while back that he\u2019d help maintain the place in exchange for somewhere to live. As long as he didn\u2019t bring shady people around or do anything illegal, the owner didn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>This was where the seven friends congregated. It was their home away from home\u2014for some even more home than their own. A place any of the six could go and they would never be turned away.</p><p>The night descended into chaos much like it regularly did. It always started out tame enough. A few of the guys\u2014usually the youngest three\u2014would crowd around the small tv that sat on Yoongi\u2019s coffee table, playing old Atari games, while a few of the others would just talk in the kitchen area, hunched over a pizza box. The older four being of legal drinking (and purchasing) age each usually supplied some type of alcohol and would experiment with mixing them. It would pretty much go downhill from there.</p><p>This night was no different. At one point, Jimin was jumping up and down on the couch with Taehyung, the two screaming the lyrics to the techno-y song filling the room when he was smashed in the chest with a pillow. Feathers exploded into the air and he sprawled off the couch and onto the plywood floor, his fuzzy head swimming even faster as he looked around dazedly for the source of the assault. At last, his eyes focused on Hoseok\u2019s beaming face and he narrowed his own at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on, hyung,\u201d he growled before grabbing a cushion off the couch and swinging it up hard.</p><p>Suddenly, the rest of the boys joined, grabbing whatever stuffed object they could find and before long, the place looked like a plushie and feather factory had exploded. Cotton and feathers covered every surface and the boys were rolling in fits of howling laughter. Jimin felt higher than a kite even as he lay among the feathers and fluff, Hoseok laying on his arm.</p><p>But once the laughter died down, a heavy silence fell over the place and within minutes, most of the guys were passed out drunk where they\u2019d landed. Jimin, however, pulled his arm out from under Hoseok and sat up on his haunches. He swayed with sleep, fighting it hard. He needed to go home. The other boys were in situations where their absence probably wouldn\u2019t even be noticed. Even Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2014out on dates most nights ever since her divorce from his father\u2014probably wasn\u2019t wondering where he was. But Jimin\u2019s parents were different. With his past and his problems and the bullying, they had come to worry a lot more easily about him. They always trusted he was safe when he was with the guys but if they expected him home, he had better come home.</p><p>He could have texted. He could have called and his mom or dad would have come and picked him up, no questions asked. But instead, he decided he\u2019d rather not bother anyone and make the short trek home.</p><p>It was a stupid idea. It was stupid. It was stupid and he knew it in his gut but his head was too numb to realize just how stupid and so he wobbled to his feet, stood there for a second to regain his balance and then slipped out the door and into the frigid night, alone.</p><p>*</p><p>He would have been fine had he stayed on the sidewalk. Just kept walking and not stopping until he was safe inside his house. But as he walked past the minute mart two blocks from home, his head lifted and his eyes locked on a rack of chips through the window. He had eaten barely anything all day and they sounded so good and he found himself veering off the path and pushing his way through the glass door, inside.</p><p>He may have even been fine if he\u2019d just grabbed the chips, paid for them and left. Even if he\u2019d tripped on the welcome mat once he was inside, <i>or</i> fumbled with his wallet for a few seconds, <i>or</i> dropped a bill while he was trying to stuff his change back into it, he would have been okay. But the fact that he did all of those things instead of just one, meant that a car was pulling up to the curb just as he was exiting the store. Just a few seconds longer and he would have been hidden again by the shadows and the occupants of the car wouldn\u2019t have even glanced his way.</p><p>But instead, he stumbled out the door, the driver\u2019s eyes immediately catching the movement, and his lips twisted into a malicious grin as he set his sights on Jimin.</p><p>\u201cWhere you goin, midget?\u201d</p><p>Jimin\u2019s blood turned cold at the familiar voice and suddenly it was as if the alcohol vanished from his system. He turned slowly, his mind no longer sluggish, but racing. And when he saw that three others were climbing out of the car along with Jiho, his stomach twisted and he felt bile rising in his throat.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Jiho,\u201d he cracked and swallowed hard.</p><p>The bigger boy laughed and folded his arms over his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t see your guard dogs anywhere,\u201d he said and made a point to look around. \u201cGetting a little brave, are we?\u201d</p><p>Jimin didn\u2019t waste another second to respond. Instead, he twisted around and took off running down the sidewalk. His heart pounded in time with his sprinting footsteps and staggered when the sound of his pursuers reached his ears. His breath became ragged in his throat and his body tingled with fear. He reached the end of the block and whipped around the corner, his shoes skidding on the sidewalk and he almost lost balance but regained it quickly, using his hands to push himself back up. There was an alley just a few yards ahead and beyond that, he could see his house. He was almost there. Relief flooded his body as his eyes locked on his front porch.</p><p>And then he felt a hand grab his hood and tug hard.</p><p>Jimin flew backward, a cry ripping from his throat as his body hit the pavement. And then more hands were on him, yanking him back up and shoving him into the dark alley.</p><p>*</p><p>Jimin finally found the strength to pick himself up almost twenty minutes after Jiho and his friends left him there in the alley. His whole body trembled and he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He didn\u2019t know if that was from the multiple kicks to the chest or if he was in the middle of a panic attack. Either way, he fought for air for what felt like an eternity before finally being able to breathe normally. After making his way slowly back to his house, he unlocked the door and nearly fell into the entryway when he twisted the knob while still leaning against it for support.</p><p>The house was quiet and dark and surely, his parents were in bed. He didn\u2019t want to wake them. He didn\u2019t want to spend any time assessing the damage done by Jiho and his lackeys. He just wanted to sleep. So, he crawled in pain up the stairs on his hands and knees, down the hallway and then climbed into bed with his torn clothes and shoes\u2014shoe? When did he lose the other one?\u2014praying he didn\u2019t die of internal bleeding or a concussion in the night.</p><p>*</p><p>When he woke the next morning, he stiffly shuffled into the bathroom to finally see how he looked. Awful. That\u2019s how. His bottom lip was swollen on one side, a deep cut slicing through it and down into his chin. There was blood crusted below his nose and several cuts and scrapes on his face. One eye was swollen practically shut, the skin around it a sickly green color. He had a big slice on one ear and bruises resembling fingerprints on his neck. His ribs ached and it hurt to breathe and when he lifted his shirt, he found his chest and stomach stained purple and black.</p><p>There was no way he could go to school like this. So he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He texted his mom from his room, telling her he felt extremely sick and couldn\u2019t get out of bed. She offered to stay home from work to take care of him but he insisted she leave. And his dad had left that morning for a week-long business trip. He was safe. Surely, over the weekend, most of the bruises and cuts would heal enough that they wouldn\u2019t be too noticeable come Monday. He\u2019d just have to avoid his mom. He texted Taehyung and Jungkook that he\u2019d gotten sick and would see them on Monday. He could put this whole thing behind him. Hopefully. He just needed to be more careful from now on.</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s nostrils flared, and the line of his jaw became prominent. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he snarled, his eyes roving over the students in the hallway as he searched for Jiho.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, no,\u201d Jimin said softly and he brought a hand up to rest on the trembling boy\u2019s arm.</p><p>Even though it was now Monday, the slice on his mouth hadn\u2019t healed as much as he\u2019d hoped. His eye was no longer swollen but was surrounded by a fading yellowish bruise. He looked better though. Good enough that he could hide it from his mom by wearing a hat and some makeup and keeping his head down.</p><p>At his touch, Jungkook immediately loosened, his face smoothing over again and he met Jimin\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy did you go back home alone after the party? Why didn\u2019t you wake me up? Or Tae? Or any of us? We would have gone with you.\u201d</p><p>Jimin raked his teeth over his bottom lip, wincing when he felt a sharp sting. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was stupid. I wasn\u2019t thinking. I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid, Jimin,\u201d Taehyung said quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say something like that.\u201d</p><p>Jimin nodded. He couldn\u2019t believe it though. He\u2019d done an incredibly idiotic thing going out alone like that. Of course, something bad would happen if he did something so careless. He deserved it. Of that, he was positive.</p><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5387390292888c67ed81d701ce8f7f91/tumblr_inline_plrijyKlN81qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrovxqrpf1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>04. Run</b></h2><p><i>Life began to get to each of us.</i></p><p><b>January.</b></p><p>December came like a quick intake of breath and went like a heavy sigh. Once the cozy feeling of the holidays was over, winter became harsh and merciless. An icy fist that squeezed and squeezed until there was no warmth left. Taehyung was used to it though. He\u2019d never liked winter. Not since his mom had died just after Christmas his fifth year. Mina had been too young to remember her, being only three years old, but Taehyung could remember her perfectly still, as if he\u2019d talked to her just the day before.</p><p>He and his sister used to stay up late a lot\u2014at least whenever they were both home\u2014curled up on their shared bed, facing each other, covered in two layers of clothes and three blankets because their father turned the heat way down whenever he wasn\u2019t home, which was often. Not often enough though in Taehyung\u2019s opinion. But they would lay like that for hours and Taehyung would tell Mina stories about their mother. He didn\u2019t have many spectacular ones\u2014being he really could only remember a few from such a young age\u2014but once those ran out, she started asking him simpler things. What did mom look like? What did she smell like? What did she sound like? Feel like?</p><p>\u201cShe looked like spring, smelled like flowers, sounded like rain and felt like sunshine.\u201d How else could he describe her? Maybe his memories were clouded by the happier life he\u2019d lived with her in it but he\u2019d rather have this version of her in his mind. He needed it. Needed something good to cling to.</p><p>*</p><p>The first time his father had hit him, he\u2019d apologized profusely afterward, and made Taehyung promise he\u2019d never tell a soul. He didn\u2019t. And he didn\u2019t the second and third time either or any time after that. He\u2019d never told anyone, other than his friends and only because they grew suspicious of the bruises and the injuries and his unexpected late night calls asking if he could sleep over.</p><p>Over the years, he became good at reading the signs and predicting when his dad was going to have an outburst. If he got home from work and slammed the door behind him, it was time to retreat to the bedroom and bolt the door. If he came with a freshly bought bottle of alcohol, it was time to leave. Taehyung\u2019s only reason for not moving out was Mina. He\u2019d made a promise to her and himself that he\u2019d always be there to protect her, even if that meant taking the brunt of the abuse himself. Which it always did.</p><p>He\u2019d ended up in the hospital a few times keeping his dad away from his sister, stepping in the way of the punches, even tackling the man to the floor to give her a chance to run. It always ended badly but he never complained. Not when it would be so much worse for her. She didn\u2019t deserve to live in fear like this. He didn\u2019t either but especially not her. He at least had good memories of their mother. She only had the nightmares that came with having a monster for a father.</p><p>When things got too hard, his friends were his escape. Five of them had their own problems. And five of them had families that would get suspicious if he came around too often and he couldn\u2019t risk anyone going to the police and tearing him away from his sister. The one person he could always count on to help and be his safe place was Namjoon.</p><p>The boy was an orphan living secretly at the gas station where he worked. Taehyung didn\u2019t have to hide anything from him. In fact, there were countless times in the past where he\u2019d show up at the gas station pounding on the door at two in the morning, broken and bleeding and Namjoon wouldn\u2019t say anything. He would just let him inside and make room for him on the small twin blow-up mattress he dragged out of the broom closet every night. And if he was too worked up to sleep, the two would go out into the city and find something to do. This usually involved spray paint and a concrete wall. More than once the two found themselves running from police sirens, having been caught mid-tag. Namjoon wasn\u2019t the best influence but he was what Taehyung needed.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cTake this,\u201d the older boy said holding out a pint of ice cream to him.</p><p>Taehyung looked down at it. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like eating ice cream right now, hyung,\u201d he uttered and swiped his tongue across the fresh cut on his lower lip. The taste of salt and iron grated against his tastebuds. His whole head hurt from the evening\u2019s beating. He was ninety percent sure he had a concussion.</p><p>\u201cFor your lip,\u201d Namjoon replied dropping it into his hand.</p><p>Taehyung winced when he touched the cold container to his wound but immediately started to feel the pain fade as his lip began to go numb.</p><p>\u201cSo, I overslept this morning,\u201d Namjoon said as he grabbed a lollipop from the rack on the counter beside where Taehyung sat and unwrapped it.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mr. Bang-nim found me this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything about all this?\u201d Taehyung asked gesturing toward the mattress on the linoleum floor.</p><p>\u201cHe said if he finds me sleeping here again, I\u2019m fired.\u201d Then he stuck the candy in his mouth and twirled the stick between his fingers.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s stomach dropped when he saw the unease written across his hyung\u2019s face. The boy had nowhere to go. Taehyung would have invited Namjoon to stay with him but of course he\u2019d never want to subject one of his friends to the hell he had to deal with every day. Though it didn\u2019t matter either way. Namjoon didn\u2019t like asking for help. He wanted to be the one his friends came to, not the other way around. The boy was independent and stubborn to a fault.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to be more careful,\u201d Namjoon said with a shrug. Of course he was only acting like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Taehyung knew better.</p><p>Light flooded the dim store as a vehicle pulled into the parking lot and Taehyung felt his heart skip at the idea they were going to be caught. But when he looked out through the storefront window, relief flooded his chest. Jin\u2019s 4x4 truck sat idling in front of the gas pumps.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted him a bit ago,\u201d Namjoon interrupted, a gentle smile lifting his mouth and causing his cheeks to dimple.</p><p>Taehyung hopped off the counter and set the pint of ice cream down before making his way outside. Jin rolled the driver\u2019s side window down, music pouring from inside the cab. The other boys\u2019 voices rose above the singer\u2019s vocals as they screamed along to the song.</p><p>\u201cLong time no see,\u201d Taehyung said slapping the oldest boy\u2019s hand when he stuck it out the window.</p><p>Jin smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a week, Tae,\u201d he said.</p><p>Taehyung shrugged. \u201cA week is an eternity in this town.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Jin\u2019s face faltered for a second and Taehyung noticed his eyes trail down to the younger\u2019s wounded lip. He quickly swiped his tongue across it to catch the remaining blood. \u201cHow\u2019s Mina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cAt a sleepover.\u201d</p><p>The oldest boy\u2019s eyes lingered on his for several moments before he finally gave a small nod. \u201cHop in,\u201d he said and motioned with his head toward the back of the truck.</p><p>Taehyung scrambled over the side and dropped into the bed beside Jimin, who sat with his back against the cab, happily cramming chips into his mouth from a bag. \u201cWant some?\u201d he asked as he offered the bag to him.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Taehyung said and barely got settled beside his friend when the truck lurched forward and they pulled back out of the gas station.</p><p>It was pretty late and almost every food place was closed save for the all-night diner they frequented. There was nothing quality or good about the food there but it was cheap, and greasy and filled their bellies. The waitresses had come to grow fond of them over the years, knowing each of them by name and favorite flavor of milkshake.</p><p>The seven of them were the only ones there, which was a good thing since they tended to get a bit rowdy. Their plates had just barely been delivered when Yoongi decided he was going to try and cheer Taehyung up by throwing a handful of french fries at Jungkook. A food fight quickly broke out between the two and the poor waitress had to dodge away to keep from getting hit by a rogue fry.</p><p>They spent hours there, stuffing their faces and drowning their problems in ketchup and grease until finally, none of them could bring themselves to take one more bite. Then they made their way sleepily back to the truck, Taehyung flopping into the bed again, this time with Namjoon, and letting his head fall onto the older boy\u2019s lap. The gentle rock of the truck as it made its way down the road and the streetlights that passed intermittently overhead made his eyelids droop dangerously low. He probably shouldn\u2019t fall asleep if he really did have a concussion, but the sound of the engine, the warmth of Namjoon\u2019s thigh pressed against his cheek and the comfortable weight of food in his belly made it impossible for him to keep his eyes open and soon he drifted off completely.</p><p>*</p><p>Taehyung woke to the strong smell of coffee wafting into his nostrils and he opened his eyes to a chipped ceramic mug inches from his face. Jimin smiled warmly from the other side. It took Taehyung a few seconds to figure out where he was and why his body was aching so bad until he shifted and realized he\u2019d slept all night in Yoongi\u2019s bathtub.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like coffee,\u201d he uttered, batting his friend\u2019s hand away.</p><p>\u201cIt woke you up, though, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Jimin asked. His voice was much too cheerful for this time of morning. What time was it anyway?</p><p>Taehyung raked his hand through his greasy hair. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost noon. You should eat something, Tae,\u201d Jimin said and offered his hand to help the boy climb out of the tub.</p><p>Panic rushed through him like ice water. \u201cNoon?\u201d he asked. \u201cI need to get home. I need to be there when Mina gets back from her sleepover.\u201d He tripped out of the bathroom and through the living room, past the other boys crowded around a table as Jin tried to build a house with a deck of cards.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up!\u201d Jungkook exclaimed throwing his arms up.</p><p>\u201cJK!\u201d Jin yelled, his hands frozen in midair. \u201cStop with the sudden movements!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d Taehyung said as he rushed past. The gust of wind he created caused Jin\u2019s card house to collapse and he let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>Taehyung didn\u2019t stop though. As soon as he was out of Yoongi\u2019s home, he broke into a run and kept running until he burst through the front door of his apartment. His eyes scanned the empty front room. Liquor and beer bottles littered the kitchen counters, junk mail piled high on the table and scattered on the floor around it. The place was a dump but that wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary. The quiet, however, was. He barely took a step when a whimper cut through the silence and then suddenly he was running again. He paused in the hallway, eyes on the shadows moving in the room at the end. The door was barely cracked open so he couldn\u2019t see who was in there. But then he heard a choked cry. Mina.</p><p>Taehyung flew back out of the hall and wrapped a fist around the first thing he could grab, a beer bottle, then charged back down the hall, bursting into the bedroom just as his father\u2019s hand connected with his sister\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her!\u201d Taehyung roared shoving him back hard.</p><p>His dad stumbled back more in surprise than pain and he stared at the boy with wild, glazed over eyes. The man reeked of alcohol even at this early hour of the day. He bared his teeth and looked like he was about to lunge. But Taehyung didn\u2019t give him the chance. He rushed forward instead, swinging the beer bottle back and sending it crashing down on his dad\u2019s skull. The man staggered again, this time stunned by the blow. The bottle had broken when it came in contact with his head.</p><p>Taehyung could have stopped there. He could have grabbed his sister and turned and ran, maybe taken her back to Yoongi\u2019s. The other boys would be able to help them. But no, the sight of his dad striking her had caused the time bomb within him to finally detonate and now he knew nothing but rage. With a scream that sounded too far away to be coming from his own lungs, Taehyung surged forward again, jabbing the broken bottle into the soft flesh of his father\u2019s stomach. He felt it lodge deep in the man\u2019s belly and a sickening groan fell from his father\u2019s lips but it did nothing to keep Taehyung from stabbing him again and again until blood soaked the front of the man\u2019s t-shirt and coated his own hands and clothes.</p><p>In the chaos, he couldn\u2019t hear anything but his own gasping breath and the cries that continued to tumble from the man in front of him until his dad finally collapsed to the floor. Then his sister\u2019s screams reached his ears, her voice already going hoarse from yelling for so long. With a violent shudder, Taehyung staggered back, letting the broken and bloodied bottle fall from his hand and clatter to the floor. His mouth fell open in a silent scream and his knees gave out. As he fell to the floor, his sister caught him, sobbing into his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Taehyung uttered. \u201cWhat have I done, Mina? What have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved me, Tae,\u201d she cried into his neck. \u201cYou saved us.\u201d</p><p>Their father lay motionless in front of them, the red spreading across his shirt until you could no longer tell what color it had been originally. It seeped down into the carpet, a dark stain that would never fully go away.</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave, Mina,\u201d Taehyung said, his voice shaking so hard it came out as barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tae,\u201d she cracked. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to.\u201d He grabbed her hard by the shoulders and pulled her down in front of him. His eyes drilled into hers. She had their mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou have to get somewhere safe. I can\u2019t come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur dad is dead!\u201d Taehyung screamed. \u201cOur dad is dead and I killed him!\u201d</p><p>A whimper fell from Mina\u2019s mouth and for the first time, Taehyung noticed the bruises welling up under he skin. There were so many. How long had their dad been hitting her before he\u2019d gotten there?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mina,\u201d he said more gently. \u201cPlease, go to a friend\u2019s house. Tell them dad isn\u2019t here and neither am I and you don\u2019t know where either of us are. Please. I\u2019ll come for you when it\u2019s safe. But until then, you have to go.\u201d</p><p>Mina nodded, her head jerking up and down erratically as she tried and failed to keep whatever last bit of composure she had. Then suddenly, she fell against him, a wail tearing from her throat and he clutched her to his chest, tears streaming down his own cheeks. His hands were coated still in his father\u2019s blood and he raked his fingers through his sister\u2019s hair, holding onto her, pulling her closer, smelling her, feeling her against him. Who knew if he\u2019d ever see her again?</p><p>Mina changed her clothes and washed the blood out of her hair from when Taehyung had held her, before rushing out of the apartment. He didn\u2019t go outside but watched her from the front window. She\u2019d texted a friend and asked them to pick her up and now he watched as she got into their car, her head lifting, her eyes locking on his one last time before she climbed into the the backseat and then she was gone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do. That moment of clarity when he\u2019d needed to get his sister away was gone and now all he could do was stare at the messy living room in shock. With his back pressed against the door, he sank down onto the carpet, his hands catching him as he fell. His hands. Covered in sticky, drying blood. His father\u2019s blood. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>A murderer.</p><p>His head began to pound as the thoughts swirled in his brain. It was all too much. Everything was too much. The coppery smell of blood filled his nose, filled his head, filled the room and it overwhelmed him. His hands shook and his breath hitched and he couldn\u2019t inhale deep enough. Too much. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>His eyes watered and his nerves were shot and he was numb but could feel everything at the same time and it was overwhelming. His skin crawled and his heart hammered and his lungs were on fire and he couldn\u2019t breathe and he squeezed his eyes shut as if he could shut out the world and it was all too much. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>A murderer.</p><p>*</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, it was dark. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d fallen asleep or passed out but when his gaze fell on the digital clock on the microwave, he saw that he\u2019d been out for nearly nine hours.</p><p>It was silent in the apartment. Silent as the dead. His head slumped to the side and he looked at the entrance to the hallway. His father was back there. Or rather, his body. If he crawled just six feet to his left, he\u2019d be able to peer down the hall and see his dad\u2019s body slumped against the wall in the back bedroom. Immediately, Taehyung felt like he was going to be sick. He made his way clumsily to his feet and tripped into the kitchen, barely making it to the sink before he heaved and the contents of his stomach emptied into the basin. He spit a few times before sitting up again, a sheen of sweat coating his skin. When he brought his arm up to wipe his forehead, his eyes locked on the brown, dried blood that crusted on his skin. Then he looked down again at his white t-shirt. Well, it used to be white.</p><p>He rushed out of the kitchen, turning his head away as he passed the hall so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally catch a glimpse of what was at the other end, then slipped out the front door, locking it behind him. He zipped his jacket up to his chin, glad that at least the dark sweatshirt hid the stains, and pulled the hood up over his hair and his sleeves down over his hands. He kept his head down to conceal any blood spatters on his face as he made his way through the dark streets and to the gas station.</p><p>To his relief, there were no cars there, but then another thought occurred to him. What if Namjoon wasn\u2019t there either? What if he\u2019d been caught again by his boss? He had to be there. Taehyung didn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to.</p><p>He jogged up to the front door and peered in. The place was dark. It looked deserted. As the panic started to set in, he raised his fist and beat it against the glass. At last, he caught movement from within. And then Namjoon appeared in one of the aisles toward the back. He seemed to recognize who it was immediately and hurried over. A lollipop stick stuck out of his mouth and he switched it from one corner to the other in a nervous habit as he unlocked the door and opened it. Only then did he notice that Taehyung was covered in blood. Slowly, he lifted a hand and pulled the candy out of his mouth.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s breath quivered as he met the older boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI did something really bad, hyung.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c22cc05dfed25979cd8bccaa2fb299e/tumblr_inline_plrim8qsxI1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrox5bo8Z1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>05. Whalien 52</b></h2><p><i>Finding the minuscule fissures in the surface and digging its fingers in until we began to splinter.</i></p><p><b>February.<br></b></p><p>An annoying ringing shattered the silence within the dark gas station causing Kim Namjoon to stir. With a groan, he started to roll over on his mattress when his body hit something. He froze in his half-sleep before remembering he wasn\u2019t alone on his bed. An arm flew out and draped over his shoulder, hand hovering in front of his face.</p><p>\u201cTae,\u201d he uttered and reached over to turn the alarm off on his phone.</p><p>Taehyung didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cTae,\u201d Namjoon said again a little louder. This time the boy let out a sleepy groan which tapered off into a snore. With a sigh, Namjoon got up off the mattress, his joints cracking as he did so and he winced rubbing his stiff neck. \u201cTae, you have to get up. You can\u2019t be here when Mr. Bang-nim shows up.\u201d</p><p>It was still dark outside but Namjoon had learned never to let himself sleep until sunrise again. The gas station he worked at was a weird one that actually closed at night unlike the majority of the other stations in town. He was the opening and closing shift Monday through Friday and his boss took the middle shift, but the man came early in the morning to drop off the day\u2019s till and Namjoon couldn\u2019t be caught sleeping there again. One more time and he\u2019d be fired and back on the street.<br></p><p>*</p><p>He\u2019d been by himself for much of his life. His parents had left him with his grandmother one weekend saying they were going on a special vacation for their anniversary. Only, they never came back. Namjoon\u2019s grandmother was an old, frail woman. Much too frail to take on a child\u2014he was barely five at the time\u2014and he spent most of his childhood fending for himself. When he was twelve, she developed cancer and passed away within just a few weeks of receiving the news. As soon as she died, Namjoon ran. He was so afraid of being put into foster care, never having a real home, never having a real family. He\u2019d basically already been fending for himself for seven years before that.</p><p>There\u2019d never been any record of his parents abandoning him or him living with his grandmother so it wasn\u2019t hard for him to disappear without a trace. The boy was clever and intelligent for his age and he was able to make it into the city and fake his way into school. He didn\u2019t care much for the classes, but going to school meant getting breakfast and lunch for free. It was there that he met Hoseok. The two became friends quickly, both having an interest in music. Hoseok was a dancer and Namjoon loved writing songs and melodies. Hoseok was already close with Yoongi who at this point was just discovering his love for producing. Together, the three of them would spend hours after school at Hoseok\u2019s house\u2014since Namjoon didn\u2019t have one and Yoongi\u2019s parents didn\u2019t approve of his newfound hobby\u2014writing music together that Yoongi would then go home and produce on his computer. Nothing ever came of it but for Namjoon, this was a pivotal time in his life. He developed a friendship with a small group that grew bigger until there were seven of them, the others like the family he never had. Brothers he was so desperate for. And for this friendship, he\u2019d be eternally grateful.</p><p>Eventually, they all figured out his situation, though he tried to hide it as he didn\u2019t want to be a burden on any of them. They found ways to help him out though, whether it was Jimin inviting him over for dinner once a week or Yoongi asking him to stay the night\u2014or several nights\u2014to help him work on a new song. The boys helped him as much as he would let them.</p><p>Taehyung, though, helped him the most, probably without even realizing it. The first time Taehyung called asking if he could stay with him\u2014at that time he had been working and sleeping at the gas station for a few months\u2014Namjoon was hesitant to let him. He\u2019d needed a job so he could afford food and a cellphone and already felt guilty having to secretly sleep at the station but he had nowhere else to go, and he worked the opening and closing shift anyway, so what was even the point of leaving at night? But then when Taehyung showed up at the gas station with a broken nose and a bruise on his throat that resembled a handprint, Namjoon couldn\u2019t turn him away.</p><p>Sure, the other boys were amazing. Always willing to help him, always wanting to do whatever they could, but it made him feel reliant on them and the last thing he wanted was to not be able to take care of himself. But Taehyung wasn\u2019t like that. Taehyung made him feel needed for once.</p><p>*</p><p>When he\u2019d shown up in the middle of the night covered in blood a month before, Namjoon hadn\u2019t wasted any time pulling him into the bathroom and helping clean him up as much as he could. He used the small travel size shampoos and soaps the gas station carried and scrubbed at Taehyung\u2019s hair and skin until the water in the sink ran clear. He had him change into the only other set of clothes he had, taking the bloody ones, dousing them with bleach and lighter fluid and then bagging them up and tossing them into the dumpster in the alley.</p><p>Then together, the two of them went back to Taehyung\u2019s apartment. Namjoon and Taehyung\u2014silent in his still shocked state\u2014dragged the body of Taehyung\u2019s father into the bathroom and dumped him into the tub. After that, Namjoon put Taehyung to work in the kitchen, having him bag up all the liquor bottles and the mail on the floor while he took care of the back bedroom. He scrubbed at the carpet with bleach until there was no trace of blood left.</p><p>He\u2019d grabbed several bags of ice and two rolls of duct tape from the gas station and now he emptied the bags into the tub before taping the window shut. Then, he shut and locked the door and sealed the cracks. With his eyes and nose now burning with the smell of bleach, Namjoon finally made his way back into the living room, only to find Taehyung standing there in the middle of it completely still.</p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his name, the boy had looked up to meet Namjoon\u2019s eyes. Taehyung\u2019s face was shining with tears as they trailed down his cheeks but you\u2019d never know he was crying by his stone-like expression.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even feel bad for doing it, hyung,\u201d he\u2019d uttered and when Namjoon looked down at his hands, they were clenched into trembling fists. \u201cI was just so angry. I couldn\u2019t stop. What\u2019s wrong with me, hyung? Why don\u2019t I feel guilty for killing my father?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon had dropped the bag full of bloody paper towels and bleach right there next to the hallway and rushed over to Taehyung just in time to catch him before he could collapse to the floor. The boy sobbed into his chest, clinging so tightly to him that his fingers bruised his skin. Namjoon held him for a long time there in the middle of the living room, not saying a word and not loosening his tight grip on him. Finally, Taehyung\u2019s sobs quieted to sporadic sniffles and then he let go of Namjoon, sitting back on his butt and dragging his hands down his face to wipe his tears away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Taehyung had asked, his voice raspy and low.</p><p>Namjoon looked around at the several trash bags filled with evidence of their being there. His attempt to conceal the body wasn\u2019t going to hold up forever. Eventually, it was going to start to smell and someone was going to discover it. Not to mention the man had a job. His absence wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed for long.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you far away from here,\u201d Namjoon finally said and Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened in fear.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t send me away, hyung,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this on my own.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Namjoon got to his feet and held a hand out to him. \u201cThen we need to figure out a way for you to hide.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Taehyung had been staying with him ever since then. Every morning before the sun came up, he would leave and every night after closing, he\u2019d return. Namjoon wasn\u2019t sure what he did during the day and would spend the whole time worrying the boy wasn\u2019t going to show up in the evening, but so far, he always did.</p><p>\u201cTae, come on, man,\u201d Namjoon said again, giving the boy a hard push and sending him rolling off the other side of the mattress with a groan of protest. \u201cUnless you want to hide in a broom closet all day, you have to get out of here.\u201d Taehyung finally stirred, getting slowly to his feet.</p><p>He rubbed at his eyes, staggered and caught himself on a rack of magazines before he could topple over. \u201cDon\u2019t make me leave today, hyung,\u201d he whined. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out there and I don\u2019t have anything to do. Just let me stay here today, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get caught?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung slowly peeled one eye open to look up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll stay hidden. I promise. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Just then, headlights flashed across their faces and Namjoon\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cGet in the bathroom,\u201d he said quickly before shoving him into the tiny space. Then he picked up the air mattress and threw it in after him. Luckily, the thing was light. After looking around to make sure there was no evidence of him being there, Namjoon ran into the backroom, unlocking the door that lead to the alley and slipping outside.He stood there behind the store for several minutes, waiting for his heart to stop hammering and the sweat that had broken out on his skin to dry. It was cold outside. A cold so sharp it stung his lungs with each breath and made his head hurt.</p><p>At last, he stuffed his numb hands into his pockets and, as nonchalantly as possible, walked around to the front of the store to meet his boss.</p><p>Mr. Bang was just getting out of his SUV when Namjoon came around the corner. The sky had lightened to a pale gray already.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Namjoon,\u201d the man said with a friendly smile and made his way toward the locked front doors.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sir,\u201d Namjoon replied. He watched with coiled nerves as his boss withdrew a key and unlocked the store. Then when he followed him inside, Namjoon\u2019s eyes shifted to the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few boxes in the back that need unpacked if you want to do that while I open the register,\u201d Mr. Bang said as he slipped behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cAlready done, sir,\u201d Namjoon replied shifting nervously from one foot to the other.</p><p>A sharp knock came from the direction of the bathroom just then causing Namjoon to jump. Immediately, he felt his face go pale. Maybe Mr. Bang hadn\u2019t heard. But when he looked back at his boss and saw that the man was looking curiously now at the bathroom, a sense of dread overcame him.</p><p>\u201cWe better not have a rat problem again,\u201d the man uttered to himself as he, to Namjoon\u2019s horror, got out from behind the counter again and made his way toward the bathroom at the back of the store.</p><p>Namjoon watched as everything seemed to move in slow motion. His eyes could only focus on the man\u2019s hand as he reached for the doorknob, and silently begin to pray that by some miracle, Taehyung would somehow be able to squeeze his long, lanky body into a dark corner and disappear.</p><p>No such luck. The door creaked open, revealing an unsuspecting Taehyung, blanket wrapped around him as he sat on the cold tile floor.</p><p>Namjoon let out a groan and squeezed his eyes shut. Maybe his boss would keep it a secret. Maybe he\u2019d understand the situation and let them stay. No, he knew better than that.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Taehyung said quietly, his mouth lifting into a guilty smile.</p><p>Namjoon\u2019s eyes drilled into the back of his boss\u2019s head as he waited with bated breath for the man to speak. The silence was thick, making it hard for Namjoon to pull air into his lungs. Then at last, the owner of the gas station turned to look at him. The expression on his face was unreadable at first. Completely blank like a mannequin\u2019s. Surely, the man recognized Taehyung from the news. The boy\u2019s picture and his father\u2019s had been on every network since the discovery of the man\u2019s body in their apartment. The police had already questioned the other boys, none of them giving any sort of answer more than a shrug and an \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him,\u201d and Namjoon hadn\u2019t even been questioned since there wasn\u2019t any record of him existing in the city anyway.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, come outside with me,\u201d Mr. Bang finally said, his voice steady, his face still unreadable.</p><p>With a quick glance back at Taehyung, Namjoon followed after him through the back room and out the exit into the alley.</p><p>Mr. Bang finally turned to face him, raking his hands down his face with a heavy sigh. \u201cNamjoon, I\u2019ve turned a blind eye a lot over the three years you\u2019ve worked for me. I paid you under the table. Didn\u2019t say anything when stock didn\u2019t match with my inventory list. \u00a0Didn\u2019t say anything when I found out you were sleeping here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Mr. Bang interrupted. \u201cAnd I hoped it was only temporary. But Namjoon, you\u2019re harboring a fugitive. I can\u2019t have that in my store. I could lose the business. I could go to jail. I\u2019m sorry but the two of you are going to have to go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon squeezed his eyes shut. He just had to think for a moment. There had to be some way for him to be able to keep his job. He wet his lips. \u201cMr. Bang\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t call the police. But you can\u2019t work here anymore. I\u2019m sorry, Namjoon. I really am.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, the boy opened his eyes again, finally meeting his boss\u2019s\u2014well, former boss\u2019s. The man had been like a father to him for the past three years. A good boss. Which had made Namjoon work hard to be a good employee. He\u2019d only taken items when he was really desperate. Though, lately he\u2019d been a lot more careless. Taking candy and food and alcohol. Even if he wasn\u2019t hiding Taehyung, he deserved to be fired. Finally, Namjoon took another deep breath. \u201cI understand, sir,\u201d he said and extended his hand. \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s mouth lifted into a sad smile as he reached out and shook Namjoon\u2019s hand. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do for you. If you need money, or a lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thank you, sir,\u201d Namjoon cut him off. \u201cI can take care of this on my own.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bang gave him a sharp nod. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a few minutes to collect your things.\u201d Then he turned and went back into his store.</p><p>Namjoon stood there in the alley for several more minutes, eyes on the ground as he kicked at the gravel with his shoe. What was he going to do now? He was homeless again. Homeless and harboring a fugitive. Taehyung wouldn\u2019t last long on the streets. Namjoon had been taking care of himself for a long time. He knew what parts of town to avoid. He knew how to evade. Where to go if he needed temporary shelter. How to survive on as little food as possible. But Taehyung\u2026he was only a boy. While his life hadn\u2019t been a luxurious one, or even an okay one, at least he\u2019d had a roof over his head. Clothes on his back. Food in his stomach. He needed that again.</p><p>Finally, Namjoon went back inside. Taehyung was leaning against the bathroom doorframe, his hands stuffed deep into his pockets, his bottom lip between his teeth. He straightened up when he saw his hyung come from the back room.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Namjoon said walking past him to the broom closet.</p><p>Taehyung followed after him. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon opened the closet and grabbed his worn, black backpack then started stuffing his few belongings into it. Beanie, face mask, phone charger, copy of Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, a journal and a pen.</p><p>\u201cHyung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d Namjoon replied and pulled the confused boy after him.</p><p>Mr. Bang stood by the door, a shopping bag in one hand and an envelope in the other. He held them out to Namjoon as they approached. \u201cTake these.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked down at the bag. He could see several cups of ramen, water bottles and a few other things through the opaque plastic.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help, sir,\u201d he said and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Taehyung look at him.</p><p>\u201cHyung, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my responsibility,\u201d Namjoon interrupted. \u201cI can take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least take your last paycheck.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon glanced down at the thick envelope then up at his former boss as he took it from him. When he opened the envelope, his eyes widened. \u201cSir, I can\u2019t accept this. It\u2019s so much more than my normal pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust consider it severance.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Namjoon stuffed the envelope into the pocket of his coat and looked again at the man. \u201cThank you for giving me the opportunity to work for you, sir. And for letting me stay here for as long as you did.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bang gave him a tight-lipped nod before stepping out of the way so he could pull Taehyung out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now, hyung?\u201d Taehyung asked as the two made their way back into the alley behind the gas station.</p><p>\u201cFor now, we find somewhere to hide until it\u2019s dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon yanked him down between two dumpsters just as a car pulled into the alley a block down. The two sat there in tense silence until it passed by them. Then Namjoon peaked his head out, not letting Taehyung get back up until the car had turned out of the alley and onto the street.</p><p>\u201cHyung?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the boy who looked back with saddened eyes. He seemed so much younger, so much smaller all of a sudden. He was only a couple years Namjoon\u2019s junior but the uneasy expression on his face made him look like a scared child. Namjoon opened his backpack and pulled out his beanie and face mask.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tae,\u201d Namjoon said handing the things to him. After Taehyung put them on, Namjoon pulled him against him and they made their way farther down the alley. \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>Throughout the day, Namjoon racked his brain, trying to come up with a solution to this rather large problem of theirs. He couldn\u2019t ask any of the guys. Yoongi could lose his home if he was caught with Taehyung, and the others lived with their families. But maybe Jin\u2026</p><p>*</p><p>The oldest boy in the group was home for an extended weekend and was the one to answer the door when Namjoon knocked. He\u2019d had Taehyung hide in the shadows created by the neatly trimmed hedge along the side of the house just in case one of Jin\u2019s parents answered instead.</p><p>\u201cJoon?\u201d Jin said stepping out onto the porch. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been busy,\u201d Namjoon replied and looked down at his feet. He hated being here. He hated what he was about to do. Hated asking for help. Because it just made him feel like he wasn\u2019t capable. Like he was worthless.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here so late?\u201d Jin asked, pulling him out of his dark thoughts. \u201cIs something going on? Are the others alright?\u201d Suddenly his eyes widened in horror. \u201cIs it Taehyung?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon bit his lip and gave a pathetic chuckle. \u201cYeah, I guess you could say that,\u201d he said then heard a rustle behind him as Taehyung stepped into the light.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jin-hyung.\u201d</p><p>Jin\u2019s eyes darted to the side to meet the younger boy\u2019s over Namjoon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cTae?\u201d Then he looked at Namjoon again. \u201cHas he been with you this whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s been staying with me at the gas station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the two of you haven\u2019t been caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were today,\u201d Taehyung answered, his words muffled by the face mask he was still wearing, and stuffed his hands into the pockets of the coat Namjoon had given him a month ago.</p><p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t be here,\u201d Jin said and took a step back so he was back on the other side of the threshold. \u201cI already had to lie to the police and to my parents\u2026and if anyone sees us talking\u2014\u201d</p><p>Namjoon let out a heavy sigh and looked up at Jin. \u201cTae has nowhere to go, hyung. He needs you right now.\u201d</p><p>Jin shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he cracked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joon, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Anger flooded Namjoon\u2019s gut as he bit the inside of his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be his friend,\u201d Namjoon uttered so Taehyung couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cAny of the other guys wouldn\u2019t even hesitate to help. You know I wouldn\u2019t normally ask for a favor but I\u2019m desperate. Please don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>Jin lifted his eyes to the ceiling, blinking hard and letting his head fall back. \u201cJoon, I don\u2019t think you understand what you\u2019re asking of me, here.\u201d Then he looked at him again. \u201cWhere would I hide him? How would I keep this from my parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother, hyung\u201d Namjoon growled. \u201cYou would <i>figure</i> it out because that\u2019s what family <i>does</i>.\u201d</p><p>Jin stepped back further, hand reaching up to grip the doorknob. He looked like he was ready to turn and run. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys,\u201d he said again shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to ask. I\u2019m sorry. Really. I wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p><p><i>There is something you can do</i>, Namjoon thought as he ground his teeth together. But he just stared back at the boy. He could see the despair written across Jin\u2019s face. Maybe he really was trapped. Maybe he really couldn\u2019t help no matter how much he wanted to. At last, Namjoon\u2019s face smoothed then with a heavy sigh, he turned around. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Tae.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gave a curt nod then looked back up at Jin where he stood in his doorway. \u201cBye, Jin-hyung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tae,\u201d he cracked.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon didn\u2019t turn around again to say goodbye. His chest felt so tight, he didn\u2019t even know if he could speak. So instead, he kept walking down the path, Taehyung\u2019s footsteps echoing behind him. Then he heard the faint sound of the door closing and the tightness dissipated, leaving him feeling emptier than he ever had before.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go now, hyung?\u201d Taehyung asked from behind him.</p><p>It was so cold now and Namjoon had no idea what to tell the younger boy. They couldn\u2019t stay out in the open like this. Someone would eventually recognize Taehyung. No, he needed to get out of the city. Far away. He needed to disappear.</p><p>Namjoon lifted his head, looked farther down the street, his eyes settling on the empty bus stop. Immediately he felt a lump forming in his stomach. He knew what he had to do.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said taking Taehyung\u2019s arm in his hand and pulling him down the sidewalk. When they reached the bus stop, he had the younger boy sit on the bench as he studied the schedule attached to a pole. A bus would be arriving any minute. Just their luck.</p><p>\u201cAre we going somewhere?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t.\u201d Then he sucked in a sharp breath and turned to face the boy. \u201cBut you are.\u201d Then Namjoon tugged his beanie down further over Taehyung\u2019s ears and lifted the mask around his neck up to cover the lower half of his face. In the bulky sweater and coat he wore, his lanky, teenage body was well hidden making it hard to tell how old he was.</p><p>\u201cWait until you\u2019re at least a few towns over before you get off,\u201d Namjoon said, trying his hardest not to meet the scared boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen you need to find some sort of shelter. If you can stay there, do it. If not, try to stay in populated parts of town. You\u2019ll be safer that way. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, hyung,\u201d Taehyung said, his eyes turned down in the corners and silently pleading with Namjoon not to make him go.</p><p>Namjoon felt his heart shatter in his chest. He\u2019d told Taehyung he\u2019d keep him safe and he\u2019d failed. With a sharp intake of breath to clear the fog from his eyes, he shoved his hand into the pocket of his coat and withdrew the envelope of money he\u2019d received from Mr. Bang.</p><p>\u201cTake this,\u201d he said to Taehyung and pressed it into his hand, not even giving him a chance to reach out and take it himself.</p><p>\u201cBut, hyung, this is all your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Namjoon said with a shake of his head. \u201cYou need it more than I do. Please, just take it and find some place safe to hide.\u201d At last he met the boy\u2019s eyes. \u201cJust find somewhere to stay put and once everything calms down, I\u2019ll come and find you. We\u2019ll figure something out together, okay?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded and then the two turned when the bus came around the corner. Suddenly, Namjoon felt unease like a chunk of ice settle in his gut. Maybe this was a mistake. His thoughts were interrupted though when Taehyung threw his arms around the older boy and clutched onto him for dear life.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you, hyung.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon pulled his bottom lip into his mouth and bit down hard to keep the tears from spilling over. In a moment of weakness, he buried his head into the younger boy\u2019s neck, and inhaled deeply. In all honesty, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do without Taehyung either.</p><p>Namjoon was the one to finally pull away. With a hard sniff, he stepped back, letting one hand linger on the boy\u2019s shoulder for just a moment longer, giving it a fond squeeze before dropping his arm entirely. The bus had already been sitting for a little while behind them, the driver waiting for the two to finish saying their goodbyes.</p><p>\u201cCall me any time day or night if you need anything,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t need anything, just call sometimes so I know you\u2019re alright.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded quickly, his breath trembling in the cold. Or maybe it was something else. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon,\u201d he said, his voice low and quivering just a bit.</p><p>Namjoon nodded back then motioned with his chin toward the bus. He watched Taehyung step on, stopping at the top of the stairs to pay for his fare before heading back to find a seat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever see Taehyung again. And as the bus pulled away, he hoped and prayed to whatever was out there that he would, but something told him this was a permanent goodbye.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4df17cf204417156d0ae1b5d07da07a8/tumblr_inline_plriogg9ll1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plroyyll771qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>06. House of Cards</b></h2><p><i>It wasn\u2019t long before we\u2019d break apart, shatter like a glass vase on the tile floor.</i><br></p><p><b>March.</b><br></p><p>Min Yoongi let out a heavy sigh, leaning way back in his computer chair until his spine gave a satisfying crack. He\u2019d been sitting hunched forward at his desk for hours now and this song he\u2019d been working on for the past two weeks was just starting to finally take shape. His stomach growled and he glanced up at the corner of his monitor to see that three hours had passed since the last time he checked. Which meant he hadn\u2019t eaten anything in almost six.</p><p><i>Just a little bit longer,</i> he thought and rolled his shoulders before leaning back in.</p><p>The sound of a groan and the crunch of couch springs came from the room next to him and Yoongi pushed back in his chair again to peer through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cKook-ah,\u201d he cracked, his voice raspy from not being used in so long. \u201cAre you getting up?\u201d</p><p>The maknae groaned again but sat up, his eyes still shut and his bottom lip jutting forward in a sleepy pout.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get going soon so you aren\u2019t late for school.\u201d</p><p>Another groan. \u201cBut it\u2019s Friday. Can\u2019t I just skip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\u2019s been gone for almost a month now. You want Jimin to be alone?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was silent for a few seconds as he mulled over Yoongi\u2019s words. \u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d he said then with a huff, got to his feet.</p><p>A satisfied smile tugged at the corner of Yoongi\u2019s mouth as he sat up and rolled back over to his desk, the wheels of his chair catching and scraping against the plywood floor.</p><p>His place was nothing special. Sheet rocked walls, plywood floors and no windows. He wouldn\u2019t even call it a house. He\u2019d barely call it livable. But it was home.</p><p>Each of the guys\u2014besides Jin\u2014had lived there at one time or another with him and Jungkook basically lived there all the time. Yoongi didn\u2019t mind. He\u2019d grown very fond of the boy. In fact, he saw a lot of himself in him. The kid was driven. He had so much potential. But life had dealt him a cruel hand. Luckily for him, Yoongi had been through something similar.</p><p>*</p><p>His parents had been the type to have his life mapped out for him from birth. They knew where he was to go to school, what college, what classes, what major, what profession he was supposed to end up with. He was their golden child and he tried to live up to their impossibly high standards for as long as he could. But music never factored in for them and when he discovered his love for it in middle school, his priorities changed. No longer did he have time for all of his AP classes or clubs or sports. It was music, music, music.</p><p>At sixteen, he dropped out and his parents\u2014disgusted at their disgrace of a son\u2014wanted nothing to do with him. Quickly, their golden child became less valuable than tarnished brass and they dumped him out on the street.</p><p>That was almost four years ago. The boy still spent most nights working on songs, writing, producing, marketing to try and get his foot in the door of the music industry but nothing had really happened. He wasn\u2019t one to give up though.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHyung, have you slept at all?\u201d Jungkook asked peaking his head into the doorway of Yoongi\u2019s studio.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes stayed glued to his monitor. \u201cI slept yesterday,\u201d he uttered suddenly feeling a rush of fatigue. He blinked hard.</p><p>\u201cHave you at least eaten recently?\u201d Jungkook took the older boy\u2019s silence as a no and leaned in to place a bowl with an apple and a boiled egg on the edge of his desk. \u201cTry to get some rest today, hyung.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grunted in reply, missing the fond smile that curled the corners of Jungkook\u2019s mouth upward. A few seconds later, he heard the front door open. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your homework!\u201d he called out.</p><p>Jungkook let out an exasperated cry before Yoongi heard frantic rustling, then a \u201cbye, hyung!\u201d and finally, the heavy door of the train car dragging across the ground and slamming shut with a metal <i>clang</i>. Once the echo faded, Yoongi cracked his neck and then leaned in again to his computer. This project wasn\u2019t like any he\u2019d worked on in the past. This one could possibly be the most important of his life.</p><p>He\u2019d seen a job posting for a producing gig in Seoul; a position at a very well known label. One that had put out nothing but incredible music since it started. At first Yoongi had been hesitant to apply but then decided to give it a shot. What was the worse that could happen? They reject him?</p><p>Actually, yes. Rejection was the literal worst thing that could happen to Yoongi. Burn his house down. Steal all his money. Run him over with your car. But please. Please don\u2019t tell him that the thing he\u2019s worked so hard on, the thing that he\u2019s so passionate about, the thing that made his parents actually kick him out of his house, isn\u2019t good enough. Nothing scared him more than that.</p><p>Yoongi pushed back from his desk again. The symbolic weight of this project had taken its toll on him over the past few weeks, causing tight knots to form in his shoulders and migraines to drill into the space between his eyes until pain killers and alcohol couldn\u2019t even dull the ache. Maybe he really did need to get some rest. Ah, but he was so close. He could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just a few more hours. Another day maybe. Just a little bit longer and it would be finished. And then the painstakingly long wait for their reply.</p><p>With an anxiety filled sigh, he grabbed the apple from Jungkook out of the bowl and took a bite.</p><p>*</p><p>Just as he thought, the song took him another two days to complete. Two more sleep and food deprived, caffeine fueled days. By the time he submitted his song, he felt ready to sleep for the next three months. Instead, that night while he was tossing and turning in bed, his phone screen lit up with an email. He reached over for it, squinting at the bright screen in the darkness. His heavy eyes popped open when he saw the name of the sender and he sat bolt upright. His heart pounded as he clicked on the email. His hands shook and he dropped his phone, scrambling to pick it up so he could finally find out if his effort had been for nothing. Then he opened the email with bated breath and his eyes roved over the first line of the email.</p><p><i>Mr. Min,</i></p><p><i>We were impressed with your song and\u2026</i></p><p>Yoongi read the whole email several times before letting the meaning of the words completely sink in. He\u2019d made it. He\u2019d made it? Yoongi got to his feet in one fluid motion.</p><p>\u201cI made it?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, he wanted to run into the living room where Jungkook was sleeping soundly and jump up and down on him, screaming until the maknae was celebrating with him. He wanted to call the others. He wanted to share the good news. But\u2026</p><p>What about Jungkook? What would the kid do if Yoongi up and moved to the big city? Of course he\u2019d want to come with him. To drop out of school, leave his foster family, leave the rest of the guys behind to follow him. No, Yoongi couldn\u2019t let him do that. His whole life was here. He needed to graduate. He needed to go to college. Make something of himself. Get out of this perpetual life of suck he was currently in. But could Yoongi leave him behind? Sure, Jungkook needed him, needed his couch, needed the security of having somewhere and someone that actually cared about him as a person instead of as a means to a paycheck from the government. But Yoongi kind of needed him too. It was nice having someone that cared about his well-being when that was usually the furthest thing from his own mind. Jungkook was always asking him if he\u2019d slept, if he\u2019d eaten, if he\u2019d showered, recently.</p><p>Jungkook was the one to keep him connected to the rest of the guys most of the time. He would have become a hermit by now if the kid wasn\u2019t constantly inviting them over to hang out. It wasn\u2019t that Yoongi didn\u2019t like having them over. It wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t value their friendship. He could just so easily get so wrapped up in a project that he\u2019d be glued to his computer for weeks. Jungkook kept him grounded. Kept him in this world instead of in his head all the time.</p><p>But this was Yoongi\u2019s dream. This was the validation he\u2019d been denied by his parents. The validation he needed. But the question was, what did he need more?</p><p>*</p><p>Yoongi slumped on the farthest cushion on the couch from Jungkook, empty glass in his hand. He\u2019d been sitting there for a while, rolling the last bit of his bitter drink around in the bottom of the glass and trying to figure out how he could possibly break the news to Jungkook that he\u2019d be leaving for Seoul the next day.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told anyone about the job offer, or rather the prospective job offer. There hadn\u2019t actually been a contract signed but Yoongi had a very good feeling that there\u2019d be one waiting for him once he got there. He\u2019d been in contact with the label since that first fateful email a week before. They\u2019d sent him several files to tweak and send back. Just more tests of his producing capabilities. They seemed impressed.</p><p>*</p><p>This party was in celebration of Taehyung coming back to them\u2014not that they ever needed a reason to get together. He\u2019d ended up getting picked up by the police a week before a few cities over and when he tried calling Namjoon, he got an automated message saying the boy\u2019s service had been disconnected. Much to Namjoon\u2019s dismay and the other guys insistence, he\u2019d had been couch surfing for the past month while he looked for a job. Since he hadn\u2019t been able to find one, he couldn\u2019t pay his bill and his phone was disconnected.</p><p>Luckily, Taehyung\u2019s next phone call had been to Jin, who had managed to persuade his lawyer father to bail the boy out and represent him in his upcoming trial. Of course, Jin had to threaten to drop out of college to get his parents to comply but they finally did much to his relief. He\u2019d felt sick with guilt for weeks after having to turn Namjoon and Taehyung away that night they showed up at his door. He\u2019d wanted nothing more than to invite them both in and promise the younger boys that everything was going to be okay. But what could have happened if they were caught under his roof? What would have become of his father\u2019s reputation? Of his schooling? \u00a0Even now with Taehyung in his care and out of jail, he couldn\u2019t get rid of the guilt that still hung over his head. And now he stood in Yoongi\u2019s kitchen, slumped against the counter, nursing his own drink.</p><p>Namjoon was having his own pity party in a different corner. The boy had confided in Yoongi a lot over the past month. Yoongi had never seen him so worked up and simultaneously so low before. His self-appointed purpose in life for so long had been as the support for his friends. As a guardian for Taehyung. And now he\u2019d failed him. Namjoon had become even more of a wreck after waking up to find his phone had been disconnected and that Taehyung had tried calling him from jail.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there when he needed me the most, hyung,\u201d he\u2019d said to Yoongi one night, tears slipping down his cheeks. \u201cWhat kind of friend am I?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Even with this being a party, no one seemed to be in a celebratory mood. While the three oldest brooded in their respective places, and Hoseok tried not to pass out from exhaustion on an arm chair, the three youngest clung to each other on the other side of the couch. The last couple of months had been traumatizing for Taehyung. From killing his father, to wandering around a strange city, to getting arrested and having to spend several nights in a jail cell not knowing his fate, it had all been too much.</p><p>When Jin and Jin\u2019s father had gone to pick him up from the police station, he\u2019d looked like a completely different person. His skin was pale and pulled taut over his bones, more prominent since he hadn\u2019t eaten much while on the run. He hadn\u2019t said a word to Jin and only uttered a \u201cthank you\u201d to Mr. Kim. His face had been completely blank and he could barely make eye contact with his oldest friend. The boy had seemed like nothing more than a shell of his former self. He warmed up a bit over the following weeks, opening up just barely, talking a little more, filling back out, and much to the others\u2019 relief, color began to return to his skin again. But that haunting look in his eyes was still there. Who knew if it would ever go away?</p><p>With one of his supports no longer by his side at school all day, Jimin had started to notice the menacing looks again from Jiho and his friends. After being ambushed a couple months back, his anxiety had been through the roof, his nerves on edge all day every day. It was exhausting. Especially keeping up a positive front for Jungkook. The poor kid was trying so hard to be there for Jimin but the original idea had been for either he <i>or</i> Taehyung to be in all of Jimin\u2019s classes which left the boy vulnerable at times. Jiho was smart. He\u2019d never touch Jimin in school but he could intimidate him which was almost worse. It made Jimin flinch at every little thing. Made him hesitate before turning corners. Made him shrink into Jungkook causing them to stumble over each other, get tangled up. Jungkook couldn\u2019t miss a single day, couldn\u2019t rest for a single moment if it meant Jimin being without his protection.</p><p>The three of them looked exhausted. Looked defeated there slumped on the couch with controllers in their hands as they played some mindless video game on Yoongi\u2019s little tv. Yoongi could see just how affected they\u2019d each become by everything over the past couple of months. The bags under their eyes. The way they leaned into each other as if making sure they were really there. The way Jimin\u2019s leg constantly touched Taehyung\u2019s as if to say, \u201c<i>It\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d </i>while his other shoulder touched Jungkook\u2019s as if to say, \u201c<i>please don\u2019t leave me.</i>\u201d</p><p>That was it. Yoongi had to break the news to Jungkook. He couldn\u2019t let him come with him. Jimin needed Jungkook. Hoseok needed Jimin. Taehyung needed Jin. Namjoon needed Taehyung. The group needed to stay together. At least the rest of them. They\u2019d be fine without Yoongi. They\u2019d find another place to hang out. Everything would be fine. But how to break the news to the youngest maknae? Yoongi looked down at his empty glass. Maybe a bit more liquid courage would help. He felt too conflicted right now. Too guilty still.</p><p>With a groan, he got up off the couch and he made his way to the kitchen. He was already feeling pretty out of it\u2014the fact that he hadn\u2019t slept well for over a week was definitely part of it. Seeing Jin there blocking the alcohol made anger flare up in the pit of his stomach. Sure the boy had eventually helped Taehyung by bailing him out of jail but the kid wouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place if Jin hadn\u2019t turned him away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing in front of the booze,\u201d Yoongi uttered. The only reason Jin was there was because he\u2019d brought Taehyung, and because\u2014despite the fact that Yoongi kind of hated him right now\u2014he was still part of the group.</p><p>Jin didn\u2019t say anything, instead just stepped to the side so Yoongi could grab the half empty bottle of whiskey. He didn\u2019t even bother pouring more into his cup, just brought the mouth of the bottle to his lips and tossed his head back. The alcohol burned its way down his throat, liquid fire pooling in his belly until he finally had to stop so he could take a breath. Then he lowered his head again, his unfocused eyes landing on Jin.</p><p>\u201cYou know what my problem is with you?\u201d he asked as he jabbed a finger into the older boy\u2019s face.</p><p>Completely taken off guard, Jin tried to step back but was already flush against the counter and cupboards. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap, <i>hyung</i>,\u201d Yoongi snarled. The energy of the whole room suddenly shifted as the others stopped what they were doing to watch. \u201cNamjoon told me everything,\u201d Yoongi continued. \u201cYou think you can just abandon your brother when he needs you the most and then just swoop in like some hero and save the day?\u201d Jin\u2019s eyes darted to the others in the room and he swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019re a real piece of work, you know that?\u201d Yoongi asked, leaning in close. \u201cYou\u2019re really just over here flaunting your silver spoon over all of our heads. Making everyone else feel like absolute crap while you\u2019re off getting some <i>fancy</i> degree. Living in your <i>fancy</i> dorms. Coming home to your <i>fancy</i> house. You know, some of us actually have to work hard to get where we want to go? Most of us have to work hard just to get by. And even then, we still fail.\u201d Yoongi let out a pathetic chuckle and wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his jacket. \u201cEverything just comes so easy for you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you even still hang out with us? Why would you want to be around losers like us all the time? Huh? Do you like just holding what we\u2019ll never have over our heads? Is that it? Does it make you feel better seeing how crappy our lives are, <i>Seokjin</i>?\u201d</p><p>A hand clamped down on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and pulled him away from Jin. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, hyung,\u201d Jungkook said in his ear.</p><p>Yoongi spun around to face him. Over the years they\u2019d known each other, Yoongi had watched Jungkook surpass him in height and stature. He was taller, broader, stronger. The boy was a fighter. A survivor. He\u2019d make it just fine without Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, get out,\u201d Yoongi said at last and took another swig from the bottle in his hand.</p><p>No one moved or said anything, none of them really sure what to do.</p><p>\u201cI said out!\u201d Yoongi\u2019s voice cracked on the last word as he raised his voice. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>The others leapt into action then. Jin slipped out from behind Yoongi and pulled his truck keys from his pocket as he made his way toward the door. At the sight of their ride leaving, Taehyung and Jimin dropped their controllers on the coffee table and hurried after him, uttering quick goodbyes to Jungkook as they passed him. Hoseok and Namjoon left silently as well, Namjoon\u2019s gaze holding Yoongi\u2019s as he made his way past him. Hoseok was too tired to even care about the outburst. He hadn\u2019t really wanted to be there anyway and now he was just looking forward to going home and sleeping. The two left, pulling the heavy metal door shut behind them and at last it was just Yoongi and Jungkook left in the silence.</p><p>Yoongi let out a heavy sigh as he placed the whiskey bottle back on the counter then pushed the heels of his hands against his eyes. His head was pounding and his throat burned and he just wanted to collapse into his bed. This whole night had been a complete wreck. He wanted nothing more than to just be alone so he could try and figure everything out. But when he opened his eyes again, he saw Jungkook still standing there with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Yoongi sighed again.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Kook,\u201d he said finally, raking his fingers back through his hair.</p><p>Jungkook furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The anguish that had been haunting him every night for the past week reawakened in Yoongi\u2019s gut and he clenched his fists down at his sides to keep his composure from cracking. \u201cI said, go home,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019m not your parent. I can\u2019t take care of you. You have a family. You have a home. Go there.\u201d</p><p>He wanted so badly to take Jungkook with him to Seoul. He wanted to protect the boy from the world. He wanted to be his home. To be his family. To be there. But he knew he couldn\u2019t and he could feel himself already starting to break apart. <i>It\u2019s what\u2019s best for him. You can\u2019t protect him. You have to let him go.</i></p><p>He wanted nothing more in this life than to not be the cause of the hurt expression on Jungkook\u2019s face. \u201cBut hyung\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get out!\u201d Yoongi screamed and squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cI don\u2019t want you anymore!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s breath hitched and suddenly he was silent. Yoongi didn\u2019t want to look at him. Didn\u2019t want to meet his eyes. But finally he did. And what he saw shattered him completely. The boy\u2019s eyes were glassy, his bottom lip pulled into his mouth. He wore the same dejected expression as the first time he\u2019d run away from home and ended up at Yoongi\u2019s. He\u2019d told him that he\u2019d gotten in a fight with his foster dad. That the man had called him worthless, nothing more than a means to a paycheck. That the minute he turned eighteen, he was out of there. Yoongi had pulled him in. Let him cry against him. Squeezed him tight and told him he\u2019d never feel unwanted again\u2026</p><p>Finally, Jungkook spoke. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi let out a stuttering breath. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d <i>Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. He\u2019ll be alright. He can make it on his own. </i>\u201cI\u2019ve had to give up a lot for you. I\u2019ve had to put my dreams on hold. My future on hold so you\u2019d have a place to stay and someone to take care of you. You\u2019ve been holding me back long enough. You\u2019re not a kid anymore. You need to start taking care of yourself. I\u2019ve done my job. Now you need to start doing yours.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook swallowed hard, eyes drilling so intensely into Yoongi\u2019s that at last the older boy had to look up at the ceiling. <i>Please, just leave. Please, just go and don\u2019t say anything.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just drunk, hyung,\u201d Jungkook finally said and stepped forward to place his hands on Yoongi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re just stressed out and you need to sleep it off.\u201d Then he started guiding Yoongi to his bedroom.</p><p>But Yoongi pushed him away. \u201cI don\u2019t <i>just need sleep</i>,\u201d he growled and turned to face the younger boy again. \u201cI said what I said and I meant it.\u201d Then he shoved Jungkook hard, causing him to stumble back toward the door. \u201cGo home, Jungkook.\u201d He shoved him again. \u201cGo home and don\u2019t come back here.\u201d Again. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here, anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop shoving me, hyung,\u201d Jungkook snapped and straightened up to his full height. The kid was massive compared to Yoongi and infinitely more intimidating. Yoongi swallowed hard but kept his expression the same. This was for the kid\u2019s own good.</p><p>\u201cThen grow up, Jungkook,\u201d he barked. \u201cStop being some weak little child. Stop depending on everyone else. Stop expecting everyone to take care of you and just man up.\u201d</p><p>This set something off in the boy. In one quick motion, Jungkook stepped forward and gripped the front of Yoongi\u2019s shirt in his fists. Fire burned in his eyes and Yoongi could feel the fear rushing through his veins like ice water.</p><p>\u201cYou want to hit me, Kook?\u201d he asked. \u201cThen hit me.\u201d</p><p>With a shake of his head, Jungkook let Yoongi go, dropping him back onto his feet, and he stumbled backward. A pathetic chuckle bubbled up from his throat and he shook his head. \u201cNot even man enough to do that.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Yoongi was wrenched forward again by his collar and he felt Jungkook\u2019s fist connect with his cheek. The force knocked him to the ground and he landed hard on his hands and knees. His mouth filled with the bitter taste of iron and when he brought his hand up to swipe at his lip, it came away streaked with blood.</p><p>\u201cI am a man,\u201d Jungkook said looking down at him. Then without another word, he went over, pushed the door open and glanced back one more time to lock eyes with the boy that had basically raised him. With that, he slipped out, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Yoongi exhaled heavily as he let his head fall back against the floor. His head was still spinning and his face stung and he could feel a trickle of blood dripping down from the corner of his mouth. He\u2019d never felt worse in his entire life. The hangover the next day was going to suck but not as much as the hole in his chest would after what he\u2019d just done. The look of betrayal on Jungkook\u2019s face would haunt him forever.</p><p>Already, feeling a bit soberer now, he could feel the guilt and regret flooding his chest making it harder to breathe. No. He couldn\u2019t do that to himself. This was for the best. He\u2019d already decided that when he took the job. He just wished things could have ended differently. Just wished he could come back once in a while to see everyone. Have them come visit him. But not anymore. Not after everything that happened that night.</p><p>With a groan, Yoongi rolled over and got to his feet. He was supposed to head out in the morning and he still had to pack everything up. All he wanted to do was sleep, but it looked like, once again, this was going to be another exhaustive night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/92db9f47e53bed0af0272d792c6cb531/tumblr_inline_plripwTCSN1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"220\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrozkJbhu1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>07. Save Me</b></h2><p><i>You can only pick up the pieces and paste them back together so many times before they no longer fit.</i><br></p><p><b>April.</b><br></p><p>One evening when Jungkook was ten, he and his parents were driving home from the grocery store. This was a weekly occurrence with them. One he always looked forward to because he and his dad would race each other down the aisles. This particular night, it was raining really hard. So hard that the wipers were working at a rapid pace to try and keep the windshield clear and the street visible. The sound, though a bit jarring, was repetitive enough to turn into a sort of rhythm. One that had Jungkook\u2019s eyelids growing heavy until he slumped against the door, face pressed against his palm, and he drifted to sleep.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, it wasn\u2019t to the sound of rain on the metal car roof or the double time beat of the windshield wipers. It was to the beeps of monitors and quiet conversations between strangers. It was too bright. Too white. Too sterile. It took him several seconds to realize he was lying in a bed in a hospital room. And his parents weren\u2019t in there with him.</p><p>The night they were all coming home from grocery shopping, a semi truck had run a red light and smashed into them. His dad had been killed instantly and his mom only lived for another week before dying in the hospital of complications. The crash had put Jungkook in a coma and by the time he came out of it, he didn\u2019t have parents. He\u2019d fallen asleep on the way home from the store and woken up in the hospital two weeks later, completely alone in the world.</p><p>For several months after the wreck, he\u2019d withdrawn into himself, and while he barely ever spoke a word to anyone during that time, the voice in his mind screamed at the heavens, demanding to know why he had lived. Why his family had been taken. Why he couldn\u2019t have gone with them. He\u2019d heard a nurse say back in the hospital that the only reason he survived was because, since he\u2019d been asleep, his body was limp, therefore absorbed most of the impact, unlike his parents who, as anyone else anticipating a collision would, tensed up. It\u2019s why drunk drivers so often walk away from a crash when their victim doesn\u2019t. If he would have been awake, maybe he\u2019d be wherever his parents were too. Maybe they could be together.</p><p>He\u2019d been in the foster system ever since then. Being moved from fake family to fake family, \u00a0temporary house to temporary house so quickly sometimes he didn\u2019t even get the chance to memorize his address. No one wanted a preteen. Once you were past the impressionable age, you were treated more as a guest in the house rather than part of the family. No one willingly took in older kids and teenagers because they wanted to. It was always for the money. At least, that was how Jungkook saw it.</p><p>He\u2019d learned that out of all of the kids he ever lived with, he was the expendable one. The one that didn\u2019t need attention. Didn\u2019t need love because he could take care of himself. Over time, he\u2019d learned to survive. To see his fake family as a provider of the bare necessities and nothing else. He\u2019d learned to never grow attached. To never let anyone in. To never even unpack his things because any day now, his case worker was going to knock on the door and tell him it was time to move on.</p><p>It\u2019s hard not to latch onto the bitterness and let it fester inside you. Especially when there\u2019s such a lack of love in your life. Jungkook shut down, made a bubble around himself of anger and hatred. He\u2019d get into it with his fake siblings, with his fake parents. With anyone that looked at him wrong. He got into sports and started working out as a way to avoid home and clear his mind. He got bigger, more intimidating. People started leaving him alone.</p><p>Then in seventh grade, he saw a small boy get cornered by a group of guys much bigger than him. He didn\u2019t even hesitate before getting right in the middle of it, blocking the boy with his body and staring them down until they backed off. That was the day he met Jimin. The day he figured out that his strength could in fact be put to good use. Jimin introduced him to Tae and it didn\u2019t take long for the two to break down his walls. To show him that there were in fact people in this world that cared about him. That he could care about too.</p><p>When he met the rest of the guys, he found himself feeling angry less often. Smiling more. Laughing even. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d laughed so much. They were his escape from the real world. The ones that kept him going. That kept him sane. He wanted to protect them with everything he had. Protect Jimin from the darkness that enshrouded him at school.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook slammed the front door to his house behind him and slung his backpack over his shoulder. His ears burned under the hood of his sweatshirt and hot tears glazed his eyes, threatening to spill over the moment he blinked. It seemed like more and more this was the way he\u2019d leave. With a shouting match between he and his fake dad and then a slam of the door.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s mom\u2019s car idled on the curb, Jimin sitting in the passenger seat, his eyes following Jungkook as he trudged toward them.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin\u2019s mom said when Jungkook slid into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he uttered and sniffed hard to keep the tears from spilling over. When his eyes were finally dry, he looked up, catching Jimin staring in the rear view mirror. The older boy\u2019s forehead was creased, the corners of his eyes dipped low with concern. Jungkook turned his head, tearing his gaze from his friend\u2019s and watched the houses rush by through the window. Then he felt his phone buzz in his pocket and he pulled it out.</p><p><b>Jimin: fake dad?</b></p><p>Jungkook glanced up again to see that Jimin\u2019s eyes were still trained on him through the mirror. With a sigh, he looked back down at his screen, his fingers typing out an answer.</p><p><b>JK: yea. im fine tho.</b></p><p><b>Jimin: ok</b></p><p>It was obvious Jimin didn\u2019t believe him but Jungkook was an impenetrable fortress that chose when to let people in and when to keep them locked out. He didn\u2019t like talking about his home life, especially to Jimin. The boy had enough to worry about with school and Jiho and therapy. The last thing he needed was to be triggered by Jungkook and his miserable situation. Jimin had always been an empathetic soul, though. And maybe that was why Jungkook had been drawn to him from the start. Jungkook was comfortable around him. He felt understood even though Jimin knew very little. The only other person in the group he\u2019d opened up to was Yoongi.</p><p>Yoongi.</p><p>The older boy had been like a big brother to him. Like a father. A protector. A home. His words still resonated in Jungkook\u2019s head, bouncing around in his skull like a ricocheting bullet. <i>I don\u2019t want you anymore.</i> He never thought he\u2019d hear that from Yoongi. His fake dad had drilled it into him that he wasn\u2019t actually wanted. That they only took in a fourteen year old with a temper because they knew he\u2019d be easier to manage than their younger wards. And money was money. As long as they kept him fed and clothed, they would receive a check every month. He expected that from them. But not Yoongi. Never Yoongi.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t believed he\u2019d heard his hyung right at first. That, for some reason, his ears had interpreted what the boy had said incorrectly. That maybe his mind had been playing tricks on him. But then the words hit him like a sledgehammer to the chest, bruising his ribcage and crushing his lungs. They\u2019d left him breathless.</p><p><i>You don\u2019t want me anymore?</i> He\u2019d had to be sure. Yoongi couldn\u2019t have said it. Couldn\u2019t have meant to say something that he knew would cause so much damage to the younger boy. That would leave him feeling so broken. So worthless. <i>You heard me.</i> And he had. And he heard him for weeks after that. Those words. Those words that pierced him to the core. That extinguished his spirit and left him groping around in darkness.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want you anymore.</i></p><p>Leaving Yoongi\u2019s house that night, he\u2019d wandered the streets for a while, his anger and hurt slowly fading to numbness. And now he only ever felt one of the two. When he was angry he wanted to punch something or someone and when he was numb, he wanted to feel pain. Just needed to feel something.</p><p>He lashed out even more at his foster parents. At the other kids in the house. At his teachers and students at school. He got in a lot of fights. Provoked classmates and rough looking strangers on the streets. He was lucky no one ever pulled a knife or a gun on him. Though maybe he secretly hoped someone would.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay at my house tonight?\u201d Jimin asked once they\u2019d gotten to school and his mom\u2019s car had pulled away from the curb. \u201cFriday night\u2019s pizza night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t turn down pizza night,\u201d Jungkook replied, the corner of his mouth twitching up into a small smirk. Just the prospect of not having to go back to his fake family after school was enough to lighten his mood a bit. Just a bit, though. Yoongi\u2019s words still dragged him down into the icy depths of a dark ocean, but the thought of staying at Jimin\u2019s house at least gave him a chance to break the surface and take in a breath before being pulled back down again.</p><p>School had never really been a problem for Jungkook. He\u2019d always stayed pretty much in the middle academically. Never getting straight A\u2019s but never getting below a C. It kept his fake parents and the teachers off his back which was all that mattered to him. Though now with Taehyung no longer at school as he awaited his trial, Jungkook was having to rush from his classes that he didn\u2019t share with Jimin to meet the boy, sometimes forgetting to turn in his homework or stopping by his locker to grab his books for his next class. He was starting to fall a bit behind and his grades were reflecting it.</p><p>Jiho had left them pretty much alone for a while now. Sure, Jungkook saw him in the halls and sometimes would catch him just looking at Jimin but it seemed like making Jimin miserable was no longer on his agenda. Maybe he\u2019d finally gotten bored of tormenting him. Though Jungkook wasn\u2019t stupid enough to let his guard down, even for a second.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot Tae\u2019s homework,\u201d Jimin said as he walked quickly down the hall toward his locker. He\u2019d been bringing work to Taehyung so the boy would still be able to graduate on time. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t grab it before class. I guess I was just in such a rush. It was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Jiminie,\u201d Jungkook said. He almost had to jog to keep up. The boy was so much smaller than him, how was he covering so much ground so quickly?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been stressed out ever since Tae got arrested and all that crap and now you\u2019re having to work twice as hard and I just\u2014\u201d he stopped in front of his locker, hand hovering over the combination dial. He squeezed his eyes shut with a sigh then looked up at Jungkook. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so weak, Jungkook-ah.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sucked in a breath, words of assurance at the back of his throat when he heard a locker slam a bit further down the hall. He and Jimin turned to find Jiho, by himself, coming toward them. Where were his friends?</p><p>\u201cSo the rumors are true, then,\u201d Jiho said, his dark eyes sparkling as he leaned against the locker next to Jungkook. \u201cYour other guard dog got sent to the pound.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was in Jiho\u2019s face in a second, teeth bared. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Tae like that,\u201d he growled.</p><p>The bully\u2019s eyes widened in fear for just a second before narrowing to slits, a devilish grin pulling his mouth upward. \u201cOr what?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch me. Not here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d Jungkook asked, stepping forward again, forcing Jiho to back up against the locker.</p><p>Jiho let out a dark chuckle. \u201cYou want to hit me so bad right now, don\u2019t you, Pitt-bull?\u201d</p><p>He had no idea.</p><p>Jungkook could feel the muscle in his arm tightening and contracting with each clench of his fist. He wanted so badly to slam his knuckles against Jiho\u2019s skull. Make him think twice before ever even looking Jimin\u2019s way again. He was so sick of seeing the fear, the exhaustion, the misery in Jimin\u2019s eyes every day when he\u2019d come to school. Even though graduation was less than two months away, it still wasn\u2019t close enough. Jungkook didn\u2019t know if Jimin was going to make it. He already looked skinnier than he had even just a month ago. Much longer and he\u2019d wither away to nothing. Disappear completely. All because of this worthless piece of trash grinning up at Jungkook. He\u2019d been feeling so cold, so empty since Yoongi had abandoned him. But now fire built in his gut. Flames licked up his chest. Burned his throat and set his eyes ablaze. If there was one thing he knew how to do, it was protect his friends. And this worm was still threatening one of them.</p><p>He\u2019d had enough.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jungkook,\u201d Jiho uttered so only he could hear. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any teachers around. Hit me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook felt a cold hand on his arm, fingers curling around his bicep. \u201cJungkook-ah.\u201d Jimin\u2019s small voice was barely audible over the sound of Jungkook\u2019s heart crashing in his ears. \u201cCome on. He\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook turned his head to look at his friend. At his tired face. At his pallid skin. His hollowed cheeks. The boy looked like he hadn\u2019t felt happiness in years, yet somehow he still managed to greet him every morning with a smile. How was this boy still alive?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Jimin,\u201d Jungkook said and glanced back at Jiho. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it.\u201d Then he turned to meet his friend\u2019s eyes again. \u201cBut you are.\u201d</p><p>Before Jimin could stop him, Jungkook reared back and threw his fist forward. It connected with a sickening crack against Jiho\u2019s cheekbone, sending the boy crashing to the ground on his hands and knees. A thick stream of bloody saliva dripped from his mouth and he spit onto the linoleum floor before looking back up to meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes. His face split in a wide, red stained grin.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, what did you do?\u201d Jimin whispered from behind him.</p><p>When he turned to look at him, Jungkook\u2019s eyes caught on someone over his shoulder. Principal Song approached with two of Jiho\u2019s friends trailing behind him.</p><p>He\u2019d been set up. Of course Jiho and his friends had planned this. Anything to get Jimin\u2019s second guard dog in trouble and out of the picture.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is going on here?\u201d Principal Song asked, his face red with anger.</p><p>Jiho\u2019s friends rushed forward to help the injured boy up and he stumbled a bit, playing up that he was really hurt. And he probably was. Jungkook had hit him pretty hard.</p><p>\u201cHe just hit me, Principal Song-nim,\u201d Jiho said weakly. \u201cJust straight up punched me in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even pretend you didn\u2019t provoke him, Jiho,\u201d Jimin snapped from behind Jungkook then looked at the principal. \u201cHe was just defending me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Principal Song barked.</p><p>Jungkook hadn\u2019t said a word or moved a muscle since first seeing the man coming toward him. The fire in his gut raged on, leaving his shoulders heaving and his heart pounding. His eyes drilled into the man as his fists clenched tighter. He could feel where the skin on one of his knuckles had split when it came in contact with Jiho\u2019s face.</p><p>Jiho. He wanted to make the boy suffer as much as he\u2019d made Jimin suffer since middle school. He wanted to make him wish he\u2019d never said a word to Jimin. Never laid hands on him. Jungkook wanted to kill him.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit this student?\u201d the principal asked gesturing toward the cowering Jiho.</p><p>Finally, Jungkook pulled in a steady breath to speak. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he told me to.\u201d</p><p>Principal Song opened his mouth but nothing came out. He obviously hadn\u2019t expected to hear that answer and now he flapped his mouth a few more times like a fish, his eyes darting back and forth between the injured boy and the one that had injured him. At last, he gathered his thoughts. \u201cWe have a strict no violence policy here. You were all made well aware of that at the beginning of the year. Did you forget?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook clenched his jaw. \u201cNo,\u201d he said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cSo what made you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been harassing Jimin since sixth grade.\u201d Jungkook said coldly. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>Again, the principal was stricken speechless. It took him just a few seconds to regain his composure. \u201cYou not liking the way we do things does not justify taking matters into your own hands.\u201d Then Principal Song turned to Jiho and his friends. \u201cPlease escort Jiho to the nurse and then all of you get to class.\u201d He waited as they made their way down the hall and disappeared around the corner. Then he turned to Jungkook. \u201cYou know the rules, young man. You\u2019ll need to come with me. Back to class, Jimin.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook watched a look of horror pass over Jimin\u2019s face as the principal took Jungkook by the shoulder and led him away. He craned his neck around, keeping his eyes locked on Jimin\u2019s until they turned the corner. Dread filled his own stomach. If he was suspended, how would he be able to protect Jimin? He turned his head to look back at the principal.</p><p>\u201cPrincipal Song-Nim, you can\u2019t suspend me. Jimin can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe staff will do whatever we can to keep our students safe,\u201d the man replied sternly. \u201cHe will be fine without you.\u201d</p><p>That was it. Jungkook ripped his shoulder out of the principal\u2019s hand and turned to face him. The boy was eye level with the man but more muscular and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a flash of cruel satisfaction when Principal Song took a slight step backward.</p><p>\u201cThis school has done nothing to make Jimin feel safe,\u201d Jungkook growled. \u201cSomething is going to happen to him while I\u2019m gone. Just watch. And when it does, I\u2019m not going after Jiho and his lackeys. I\u2019m coming after you.\u201d</p><p>Principal Song\u2019s eyes narrowed to shining black slits. \u201cThat sounded like a threat, Jeon Jungkook,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd threats will not be tolerated at this school.\u201d Then he straightened up, standing eye to eye once again with the boy. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer suspended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWai\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re expelled.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook could feel the anger churning in his belly like an ocean in a hurricane. His fists clenched at his sides and his jaw became prominent as he ground his teeth together.</p><p>\u201cNow, if you don\u2019t want the police to get involved, I suggest getting off school grounds immediately.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook watched out of the tops of his eyes as the man turned and strolled away and into his office. The whole inner wall was glass so Jungkook could see him go all the way across the room to sit at his oak desk. When the principal was finally seated, he looked up, locking eyes with Jungkook before reaching slowly for the phone. Obviously, he\u2019d been serious when he said he\u2019d call the police on Jungkook if he didn\u2019t leave right then. What else could Jungkook do but go? He couldn\u2019t go back to tell Jimin what happened. He couldn\u2019t return the next week to walk him to his classes. It was over.</p><p>With a defeated sigh, his angry expression fell and his eyes slid from the principal\u2019s down to the floor as he trudged toward the exit. What was he going to tell Jimin?</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook waited at the bus stop across the street from the school until the students were let out at the end of the day. He couldn\u2019t risk being caught on the property and getting the cops called on him, so when he finally saw Jimin coming out the front doors, he jumped to his feet and waited anxiously there on the other side of the crosswalk like a dog at the end of his leash. His eyes followed the boy closely, never straying as Jimin pulled his hood up over his faded orange hair. He watched him make his way across the street, his hands jammed deep into the pocket of his hoodie. Watched him glance his way before shaking his head and trudging past him down the sidewalk.</p><p>Jungkook knew he looked ridiculous trailing after the boy like a puppy but he couldn\u2019t help it. He needed to apologize. Needed to explain. Needed Jimin to stop ignoring him. Please, just stop ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cJiminie, just stop for a second. Please,\u201d Jungkook finally said, grabbing the smaller boy\u2019s arm and spinning him around to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hit him, Jungkook?\u201d Jimin asked. He set his jaw in a hard line, his eyes drilling into Jungkook\u2019s and for the first time, Jungkook actually felt intimidated by his icy stare. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Jungkook looked back at the school again. It was several blocks away now. Jimin had gone pretty far before Jungkook caught up to him. \u201cI just need to tell you something\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin said. \u201cTell me exactly what you were thinking. Tell me why you thought it would be a good idea to punch Jiho <i>at school</i> when you know that they\u2019ve been cracking down on their whole <i>no violence</i> policy, which is a load of crap, by the way, since apparently Jiho doesn\u2019t even need to touch me to mess with me every day. And now, you\u2019ve gone and gotten yourself suspended so what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpelled.\u201d</p><p>Jimin went silent.</p><p>Jungkook didn\u2019t want to meet his eyes. He kicked at a clump of moss sticking up from between a crack in the sidewalk. Stuffed his hands in his pockets and grabbed at the lint that had collected in the seams. Rolled his tongue against his cheek. Until finally, the silence was too heavy to bear and he had to look up. </p><p>Jimin\u2019s icy facade had melted, leaving a stricken expression on his pale face. His lips were slightly parted, his shoulders heaving and then his fingers flew up into his hair and panic filled his eyes. \u201cY-you what?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Jungkook wished he could take everything back. Wished he hadn\u2019t let Jiho\u2019s comment about Taehyung get to him. Wished he\u2019d controlled the fire raging in him. Wished he\u2019d fought the urge to hit him. Wished he hadn\u2019t just uttered the one word that could make his friend suddenly look so scared.</p><p>Jimin\u2019s breathing turned ragged and he raked his quivering hands down his face. \u201cExpelled?\u201d he cracked. \u201cYou got expelled? I won\u2019t have you? I won\u2019t have Tae? Jiho will\u2026\u201d He staggered, almost crashing into the bushes lining the sidewalk if not for Jungkook reaching out and grabbing him. The boy\u2019s skin felt clammy, his whole body trembling. Jungkook had seen his friend have plenty of anxiety attacks but this was completely different. A panic attack worse than any he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Jiminie,\u201d Jungkook whispered as he sank down onto the curb, enveloping the boy in his arms, letting him crumble into his chest as he descended further into panic. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. You won\u2019t be alone. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Jungkook knew he was making empty promises. He wasn\u2019t allowed back on school property. Tae wasn\u2019t going back to school, at the very least, until after his trial and that was only if he was found not guilty. And even then, school would be over anyway. Jimin was right. He was all alone. And it was Jungkook\u2019s fault.</p><p>*</p><p>It had been almost eight years since he lost his parents and the memories, the details, had faded over time. But sometimes, out of nowhere, his mom or dad\u2019s face would appear in his mind with startling detail, leaving him breathless.</p><p>This time it was a dream that they appeared to him in. More of a nightmare, really. He could see the crash happening. Hear the collision. The jarring sound of tires squealing, brakes seizing, glass and metal crumpling. He saw his mom\u2019s terror-filled eyes and heard her scream his name. And then he woke up.</p><p>It took him a second to realize he was laying on the floor in Jimin\u2019s room instead of sprawling across the backseat of a car. A layer of cold sweat coated his naked torso and matted his hair down to his forehead.</p><p>He heard a groan just then and watched as Jimin\u2019s arm stirred where it lay slung over the edge of his mattress. \u201cJungkook-ah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jungkook said sitting up and pressing his palms into his eyes. \u201cJust had a nightmare, Jiminie. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>With another barely-awake groan, Jimin rolled over to face the wall. Jungkook peered at him from over the edge of the bed. The boy\u2019s blankets had slipped off of him in the night and now he lay curled into a ball, his cotton pants riding up his legs to expose his boney ankles. He was so small. Too small.</p><p>Jungkook got up quietly and tugged Jimin\u2019s blanket back in place over his body. The boy nuzzled his pillow, never opening his eyes but letting out a contented sigh. At least he seemed to be having good dreams. With a sharp breath to clear his head, Jungkook reached for his shirt and tugged it on then grabbed his hoodie and slipped from the room quietly.</p><p>The whole house was dark and silent, the place awash in cold, blue light cast by the streetlamp that filtered in through the filmy curtains covering the windows. Jimin\u2019s house was nice. Not super nice like Jin\u2019s, but homey, comfortable. Jungkook felt a stab of jealousy in his gut as he made his way to the entryway where his shoes were. He passed walls lined with photos of Jimin in different stages of growing up. Family photos and birthday photos and school photos. Jungkook hadn\u2019t lived in a house where his picture adorned a wall in a long time. Having been shuffled from one place to the next so many times had made him forget what it was even like to have a place to call his. Sure, he\u2019d been with his current caretakers for a few years now but he\u2019d never go so far as to call those people his family or that house his home.</p><p>After pulling his shoes on, Jungkook unlocked and opened the front door quietly. It was unusually warm for a spring night but Jungkook welcomed the feeling of the wind on his face. He\u2019d woken up with goosebumps dotting his skin and this was the comfort he needed to wash away the image of his mom\u2019s terror-filled eyes.</p><p>He often went for walks when he needed to clear his head. So much had happened that day that this walk was necessary. Heck, the past several months had been nothing but one hit after another. From Taehyung killing his dad to getting arrested, to Yoongi suddenly flipping out on Jin and tossing Jungkook out like a piece of trash. Jungkook sucked in a sharp breath at that last thought. </p><p>He\u2019d made it to the end of Jimin\u2019s street, past the mini mart and out onto the main road that ran through the city. He wasn\u2019t sure where he was headed but it didn\u2019t really matter anyway. He could go on forever and no one would miss him. He already was nothing but a burden on the people that knew him. And he\u2019d let down the only one that didn\u2019t see him as such.</p><p>After hearing the same words for the past eight years of his life, that he was only as good as the money he brought in, that he needed to stop relying on others to take care of him, that he needed to grow up and be a man, it was hard to not believe it was all true. And then there was Jimin. His best friend and the boy that relied on him more than anyone else. The boy that trusted him to keep him safe and he\u2019d failed. Failed at his one responsibility.</p><p>Jungkook cut across the street and around a corner. The school loomed in front of him, its tall, white stone clocktower raising up to pierce the sky like a blade. Jungkook sat down on the bench he\u2019d waited for Jimin on earlier in the day and rested his head in his hands.</p><p>That dream had really shaken him. Had brought everything back. And now the hole in his chest that had finally begun to shrink with time felt gaping again. Without any warning, his chest contracted and he let out a sob. Then the tears came.</p><p>He buried his face in his arms, crumpling into a ball there on the bench as he cried. His voice echoed down the street, filling the darkness with sounds of anguish. He didn\u2019t know how long he cried but when he finally looked up again, his lungs hurt and his eyes burned.</p><p>Jungkook leaned back, resting his head against the back of the bench so he could look up at the sky. The city lights washed out most of the stars but the brightest ones were still visible. Shining and twinkling the way stars do, completely unaware or maybe uncaring of the trivial problems of humans. Stars have much bigger things to worry about.</p><p>With a heavy sigh Jungkook got up again. The air had cooled significantly since he left Jimin\u2019s house and now he hunched his shoulders forward and shoved his hands deep into his pockets to brace himself against the chill. He was exhausted and only now did he regret leaving the house in the first place. It was going to be a long, cold walk back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even see the car flying down the road toward him. The driver apparently didn\u2019t see him either because they didn\u2019t even attempt to slow down before plowing into him. The whole thing happened so quickly that Jungkook didn\u2019t know it until he landed on the road on his back with a sickening crunch. The impact ripped all of the air from his lungs and he lay there for several panicking seconds as he tried to will them to expand again. When he finally was able to pull in a breath, he knew something was wrong. He couldn\u2019t inhale right. When he tried to move his legs, they wouldn\u2019t budge. He couldn\u2019t feel anything. Something was definitely wrong.</p><p>His heart pounded in his chest and he could hear how ragged and shallow his breathing was. His vision blurred with every beat. The air grew thick and suddenly he felt like he was drowning. Panic washed over him like a wave and his unfocused eyes watched as the surface grew more and more distant. He was sinking further. Falling into the dark depths of the unknown.</p><p><i>Please, no. Please, not here. Not like this.</i></p><p>Jungkook could feel himself being tugged further down and he grit his teeth, struggling against current. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn\u2019t fight it. He could feel his energy draining. Feel his heartbeat weakening. The sound of it slowing seemed to surround him until it was all he could hear. Until there was nothing but him, floating in this black ocean, listening to his dying pulse.</p><p><i>Please\u2026not like this.</i></p><p>He thought of Jimin, sleeping peacefully in his bed. He thought of Tae who still constantly wore that haunted look on his face. Of Hoseok and how lifeless he\u2019d become. Of Namjoon and how much he beat himself up over letting Tae down. Of Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cYoongi.\u201d</p><p>The name left Jungkook\u2019s lips in a cracked wheeze. His throat constricted and it took him several more seconds and too much energy to force the muscles to relax so he could breathe again.</p><p>What he wouldn\u2019t give to see Yoongi again. He just wanted to hear his voice. Wanted to hear him assure him that everything would be okay. That he would get through this. That what happened with Jimin wasn\u2019t his fault. Though he knew it was.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to die alone.</i></p><p>A sob broke free of Jungkook\u2019s throat and he took in another gasping breath before plunging below the surface of the dark ocean again. Memories of his life floated around him in the darkness. As if watching silent movies on a projector, his eyes roved over the familiar scenes. Of when he met Jimin, and the rest of the guys. When they had their first beach day. Of one of the many parties at Yoongi\u2019s where Jungkook spent the whole time on the couch stuffed between Jimin and Tae while playing video games. Of the first time he went to Yoongi after his fake dad told him he was worthless. Yoongi pulling him in for a hug, his arms holding Jungkook\u2019s broken pieces together. And finally, his eyes fell on a memory. A memory of him and his parents the night before his seventh birthday when the three of them were making cupcakes and he and his dad ended up getting into a frosting fight.</p><p>He focused on his parents\u2019 faces. On the laugh lines creasing the corners of his mom\u2019s eyes. On the gray flecks of scruff peppering his dad\u2019s chin. These were the things he had forgotten over the years. The things that were so vivid and real to him now.</p><p>Suddenly the thought of dying didn\u2019t terrify him anymore. Now, instead, Jungkook could only feel an undeniable sense of peace. He\u2019d finally get to be with his parents. He\u2019d finally have a family again. He was so close to the edge, he could feel it.</p><p>At last, he opened his eyes. The black sky stretched above him and through the blurry film of tears, he could still make out the stars. Now they didn\u2019t seem like cold, uncaring orbs of light in the distance. They were much closer. So close he\u2019d be able to reach out and brush them with his fingertips if he had the strength.</p><p><i>Kook-ah. What do you think you\u2019re doing?</i></p><p>Jungkook blinked hard and sighed. \u201cYoongi-hyung?\u201d he uttered, his words drawn out and slurred. He could feel himself fading fast.</p><p><i>Just hold on, Kook. Just keep fighting.</i></p><p>Jungkook\u2019s heart rate plunged again, his thoughts suddenly foggy. It was getting harder to breathe. \u201cI-I can\u2019t\u2026hyung.\u201d</p><p><i>Do it for us, Kook. Please. Do it for Jimin.</i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026too\u2026\u201d Jungkook could feel himself drifting in and out of consciousness, \u201clate\u2026for Jimin.\u201d</p><p><i>Bull.</i></p><p>A puff of air escaped his nose in a weak laugh. He couldn\u2019t help feeling a twinge of sadness at the thought of leaving his friends behind. He felt the warmth of fresh tears spring to his eyes when he thought about the moments he\u2019d shared with them. The parties, the jokes, the meals at the diner. He\u2019d had nothing until he met them, and then they were his everything. He couldn\u2019t leave without saying goodbye.</p><p>With his teeth gritted against the pain, Jungkook slid his arm along the pavement, scraping the exposed skin of his wrist across the ground as he reached for his pocket. His energy was draining fast and he knew he didn\u2019t have much longer. By the time his fingers brushed the hem of his pocket, he was breathing hard. Just a little bit further. A choked sob fell from his lips when he realized his pocket was empty. His phone wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Exhausted, he let his head fall to the side, his fading vision landing on the cracked black device sitting next to him. He felt like he was going to cry with relief. His arm was too heavy to lift and for a few seconds he stared helplessly at his phone, the sound of his heartbeat slowing in his ears. But then he pulled in a breath.</p><p>\u201cHey Siri,\u201d he wheezed and then waited with bated breath until at last, the screen of his phone came to life and his mouth nudged up into a weak, triumphant smile. \u201cCall\u2026\u201d Who could he call? \u201cCall Seokjin,\u201d he finally said. As the screen changed, he waited, closing his eyes and letting the sound of the ringing fill his head. It took four agonizing rings before Jungkook heard the sound of someone answering.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s face crumpled at the sound of the familiar voice and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to speak.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Jin\u2019s voice echoed again. \u201cJungkook-ah?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sucked in as deep of a breath as he could. \u201cHyung?\u201d he cracked.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah? Do you know what time it is? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook opened his mouth to respond but instead, a sob pushed its way out.</p><p>\u201cJungkook? What happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d The older boy\u2019s voice rose with panic.</p><p>\u201cI tried, hyung\u201d he whispered letting his cheek fall to the pavement. He squeezed his eyes shut as another cry tumbled out. \u201cI failed. I failed Jimin\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what? Jungkook, where are you? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI failed Yoongi-hyung\u2026\u201d</p><p>On the other end of the line, Jungkook could hear faint rustling sounds as Jin got out of bed and started fumbling around in his room. \u201cJust stay on the line with me. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook took in a wheezing breath as his surroundings began to fade. He tried to keep his eyes focused on the glowing screen of his phone where it lay close to his head. He couldn\u2019t feel his body anymore. He couldn\u2019t feel the cold air, or the rumbling pavement. He couldn\u2019t hear the sirens in the distance or the fact that they were growing closer.</p><p>\u201cJust tell the guys I love them. Tell them I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered as the tears slipped past his eyelashes and slid down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, stop,\u201d Jin cracked. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. Just tell me where you are.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook tried to open his mouth again, tried to draw in another breath but he was too tired. Too far gone. Instead, he closed his eyes, listening to Jin go on, his voice distorting as he yelled into the receiver. At least he wasn\u2019t alone anymore.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5278d232b602c34d39793022179c7c5d/tumblr_inline_plriraA9Do1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp0ciuWY1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>08. Butterfly</b></h2><p><i>Before the gaps are too wide. Before the whole thing becomes useless.</i><br></p><p><b>May.</b></p><p>It had been a week since Hoseok had gotten the call from a distraught Jimin that Jungkook had been hit by a car. He\u2019d rushed to throw his clothes on and swipe his keys off his dresser before tearing out of his house so quickly, the walls trembled with the slam of the door. His poor car could barely keep up with how hard he laid on the gas pedal, the tires protesting loudly around every turn. Luckily, there were no other cars out at this hour because, though he was driving fast, Hoseok couldn\u2019t actually see very clearly through the panicked tears that blurred his vision.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d gotten to the hospital, they\u2019d already taken Jungkook back. He saw Jin first. The boy looked like he\u2019d been woken out of a dead sleep, his face all puffy, his hair sticking out every which way, a hoodie thrown on over his white t-shirt and sweatpants. He was bent at an odd angle over the arm of the chair, leaning into the one next to him.</p><p>It was only when the younger boy lifted his head that Hoseok saw that it was Jimin crumpled in Jin\u2019s arms. He was trembling, his small hands in his hair, his face so red and puffy that his eyes were just dark slits. He didn\u2019t even have a coat on. Just his light blue, cotton pajamas and a pair of shoes.</p><p>\u201cHobi-hyung?\u201d he cracked, his voice breaking.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart dropped at the sound of his voice and he rushed forward falling to his knees in front of him. \u201cWhat happened? Is Jungkook\u2026did he\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Jin said as steadily as he could, though Hoseok could still detect a hitch in his voice. The oldest was trying so hard to keep it together for Jimin. \u201cThey just took him back a couple minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t breathing well,\u201d Jimin added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d His bottom lip quivered and he pulled it into his mouth and shook his head. Then his face twisted in anguish and he fell forward with a sob, his head landing on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Hoseok immediately wrapped his arms around the younger boy\u2019s neck and stroked his hair, whispering gentle reassurances in his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Namjoon?\u201d Jin asked quietly. \u201cI texted him. Figured he\u2019d come with you.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok looked up to meet his eyes. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s working tonight.\u201d Namjoon had been staying at Hoseok\u2019s house now for a couple of weeks and had finally gotten a job doing night shift janitorial work at an office building. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll see your text before\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doors to the waiting room burst open as Namjoon\u2014still in his work coveralls\u2014stumbled in. His eyes were wide as they scanned the room before settling on the three boys in the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked hurrying toward them. \u201cI got a text from Jin-hyung about Jungkook\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in an accident, Joonie,\u201d Hoseok whispered.</p><p>At the sight of Jimin still limp against Hoseok\u2019s shoulder, Namjoon deflated entirely, his face going pale, his jaw slackening. He looked to Jin. \u201cIs he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Jin said cutting him off.</p><p>\u201cWell, did anyone call Yoongi-hyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTae\u2019s trying to get ahold of him right now,\u201d Jin said.</p><p>The four were silent for a while. The almost empty waiting room seemed too cold, too bright, too harsh for the situation. Hoseok wished he could turn all the lights off. He just wanted to shield Jimin from everything. From the prying, mock-sympathetic eyes of the few other people sitting in there. From the sounds of reception\u2014the hushed conversations, the joking banter of the staff just trying to make it through their shift. It wasn\u2019t right. Their friend was <i>dying</i>. Why did nobody else care?</p><p>*</p><p>Jimin had spent all of his free time at the hospital after that. Though they\u2019d gotten word a few hours after getting there the first night that Jungkook was stable but unconscious and that his condition had stayed pretty much the same all week, Jimin still went. Still sat in the waiting room, asking anyone that came out of the swinging doors if there had been any change. There never was.</p><p>Hoseok would accompany him on the days he felt he could drag himself out of bed, which wasn\u2019t often.</p><p>It had been eight months since he threw his painkillers in the bonfire on Beach Day and he\u2019d been regretting it every day since then. The first few weeks were spent in his bed, his skin clammy and feverish as he fought through the withdrawals. He\u2019d tried quitting cold turkey before but had never lasted longer than a week before going back to them. He never thought he\u2019d make it this far. Though if the withdrawal symptoms didn\u2019t let up soon, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. He didn\u2019t know how much more of this pain he could take.</p><p>It had been three years since Hoseok\u2019s accident. Only two months of that were supposed to be with the painkillers and then he was supposed to be prescribed something weaker. But the severe pain lasted and the longer Hoseok stayed on his opioids, the further into addiction he fell, until he couldn\u2019t even function in the morning without first popping a few pills.</p><p>Three years. Three years of wandering through life in a fog. Of never being able to get his hands to stop quivering, and he could feel it, even if no one else noticed. Of pretending that he wasn\u2019t higher than a kite\u2014especially around his friends. He\u2019d gotten really good at faking normal. It had become the only normal he knew.</p><p>*</p><p>Before his accident, Hoseok had been an incredible dancer. He\u2019d been doing it practically since he could walk and he was well on his way to becoming one of the best street dancers to ever come out of South Korea. His path was set. He had performing arts colleges lining up to accept him, scholarships already promised to him while he was still in middle school. A lot rested on his shoulders.</p><p>Then the night before his tenth grade showcase, he\u2019d decided to stay late after rehearsal. He\u2019d gone through his routine so many times, he knew every twist, every pop, every step perfectly, but still he just wanted to make sure. Had to make sure he had it positively nailed. That even the nerves over the fact that there were going to be college scouts in the audience watching his every move didn\u2019t distract him.</p><p>That night ended his dance career before it even had a chance to start. Hoseok didn\u2019t remember falling. In fact, looking back, he couldn\u2019t really remember anything from that night other than staring up at the ceiling in his hospital bed for literally hours, his head set up in an uncomfortable neck brace, and just letting the tears fall. His dreams were shattered the moment he heard the words \u201csevere spinal injury\u201d. There was no hope for a full recovery.</p><p>*</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s mom had been running the dance studio since before Hoseok was born. She used to bring him with her to work when he was just a baby, her students fawning over him, pinching his tiny cheeks and passing him around between them during their down time. As he grew up, he\u2019d join the classes, picking up on the choreography so quickly and so well that when he was finally old enough to be a student at the studio, his mom put him in with the advanced class. Even then, he spent more time helping her come up with the routines and teaching the class rather than being taught. Eventually, she gave him his own weekly slots to teach in. He loved it. He loved creating routines and watching as his students began nailing them, mirroring him and showing his own creation to him. He loved teaching the little, little kids, standing back amusedly watching them completely ignore his direction and do their own thing. More than that, though, he loved in the evenings after the last class had left, when the studio closed for the night and his mom had gone home.</p><p>He\u2019d stay there, just him in the empty studio, the lights down and everything washed in blue darkness. He loved dancing in the dark\u2014in the dim light so he could only catch his reflection in the mirror when he was moving. It made him look like he was a part of the air. Like he was moving through water. A spirit, caught up in the slivers of moonlight for just a flash before he melted back into the darkness again. It helped him to feel the music better. To come up with his intricate choreography. It made him well-known in the city for being such a good choreographer. A ray of sunlight that liked to dance in the darkness. A contradiction almost as beautiful as the way he moved.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cStill no change?\u201d Hoseok asked Jimin after the younger boy had slid into the passenger seat of his car. It was Thursday, and Thursday meant group therapy. When Jimin wasn\u2019t at the hospital, Taehyung was. Together, the two of them made sure that there would never be a chance of missing any new information.</p><p>Jimin looked down at his phone once he\u2019d settled into his seat, his thumb gliding over the smooth surface of his black screen. \u201cI guess not,\u201d he uttered then looked up at Hoseok. \u201cTae would tell me right away if there was, right?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok nodded quickly, not giving Jimin a chance to doubt it even further. \u201cOf course he would,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no news is good news, right? It means Jungkook isn\u2019t getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr improving.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok bit the inside of his cheek. While his youngest friend\u2019s health was staying pretty much the same, Jimin\u2019s was getting worse. Without the protection of Taehyung or Jungkook, Jimin was now fully exposed to relentless tormenting from Jiho. Hoseok himself had called the school and talked to the principal but the man had said that they can\u2019t do anything unless Jiho physically touches the boy. It was like they didn\u2019t care about the fact that this was very obviously affecting Jimin mentally. Had there not been enough stories already on the news and online of kids killing themselves over bullying? Did no one care or even realize that words can do so much more damage?</p><p>Every day, Jimin was stepping onto the battle field the moment he entered the school building. Every day he faced an onslaught of mental assault. High school had become a war zone for him and Hoseok noticed every time he saw the boy that he was fighting a losing battle. The scars weren\u2019t visible but they were deep and they\u2019d be there forever. And no one would do a thing about it unless Jiho touched him.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Jimin?\u201d Hoseok asked knowing full well that the answer was not going to be good.</p><p>Jimin didn\u2019t respond at first. He just kept his eyes focused on the phone in his lap. His bottom lip quivered and his thumb continued to trace circles on his phone screen. Finally, he took in a shuddering breath. \u201cI miss him, Hobi-hyung\u2026\u201d he whispered. His breath hitched. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t know if I can take much more\u2026\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart splintered in his chest and he gripped the steering wheel tighter. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me what would help and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>At last, Jimin looked up to meet Hoseok\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me he\u2019s going to make it. Tell me everything will be okay.\u201d Jimin swallowed hard. \u201cTell me it\u2019ll all go back to normal again.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok closed his eyes and thought back to Beach Day. How could so much change in eight months when the group\u2019s friendship had never wavered in five years? Hoseok couldn\u2019t even remember the last time the seven of them had hung out without it somehow ending in an argument. Everything was different. And after Yoongi had gone off on Jin, kicked everyone out and moved, Hoseok didn\u2019t think anything would ever return to normal. At last, he opened his eyes again, turning his head to meet Jimin\u2019s. He could feel the fatigue keeping his eyelids from lifting all the way. His chest felt hollow and his bones felt heavy. But still, he pulled his mouth up into a smile. One not nearly as bright as the smiles he\u2019d produced in the past.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll all be okay, Jimin,\u201d he said, trying to make his words as convincing as possible. He knew he was lying. He knew nothing would ever go back to the way it was before. But that look on Jimin\u2019s face. That darkness, that dull absence of the spark that always used to light his eyes, that kept him going even though there was so much trying to push him back. It was all so present that Hoseok would say anything to give him just a little bit of hope. Just something to live for. He reached over and gripped the younger boy\u2019s hand. Jimin\u2019s skin was dry and loose, like there was too much of it for his shrinking body. \u201cI promise,\u201d Hoseok added onto the end.</p><p>The corner of Jimin\u2019s mouth twitched upward for just a second, as if that was as much of a smile as he could muster and then he nodded and turned away to look out the window at the students that had congregated in front of the school. Hoseok watched him for a moment longer. He could almost feel the longing Jimin felt as he watched the others interact. It looked so easy. So unattainable.</p><p><i>Please God, let things get better,</i> Hoseok pleaded silently, then shifted gears and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHoseok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom,\u201d Hoseok called back. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d He kicked his shoes off and tossed his keys onto the console table inside the door.</p><p>He heard commotion in the kitchen and followed the sounds until he reached the doorway, then he stopped. His mom leaned back against the counter, a glass of wine in her hand. Just about a foot away, stood a man he\u2019d never met before. The two had obviously been standing closer, doing who knows what\u2014though with the flushed look on Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2019s face, he could take a guess.</p><p>\u201cSeoki honey, this is Seojoon. I met him yesterday at the supermarket.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok just looked at the man who looked back and raised his hand in an awkward wave. \u201cHi,\u201d he said and Hoseok gave him a haphazard smile before shuffling over to the fridge.</p><p>\u201cHoseok used to help me at the dance studio,\u201d his mom continued completely ignoring the fact that her son hadn\u2019t given her new friend the warmest greeting, \u201che was an amazing dancer.\u201d</p><p><i>Is she seriously talking about me as if I\u2019m not even here? </i>Hoseok pulled a bottle of iced tea out of the fridge and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cHis father and I had pretty high hopes for him before his accident.\u201d</p><p>Her words grated on his nerves, feeling like fingernails raking down his spine and he spun to face her. This new man friend of hers just nodded uncomfortably, his eyes barely even sympathetic. Of course he didn\u2019t want to hear about her poor poor son. In fact, he probably had been expecting a lot less talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my room,\u201d Hoseok uttered then left the kitchen before his mom could say anything.</p><p>By the time he reached his bedroom and closed his door, his head was pounding. Therapy hadn\u2019t been something he\u2019d taken seriously in a long time but he still went for Jimin. And because it kept him out of the house for that much longer.</p><p>His mom and dad had split just a year after his accident, saying it had nothing to do with him even though he knew that was a lie. The only thing that had kept them together before that was their determination for their son to become a professional dancer. He\u2019d never even really seen them in the same room together unless it was absolutely necessary. They\u2019d spend dinners talking excitedly about Hoseok\u2019s next show or some new college that wanted him, but then once those conversations came to an end, there was nothing else to say. At least not to each other. They didn\u2019t care about the other\u2019s careers, didn\u2019t care about how the other was doing. It was all about Hoseok. Well, it was all about Hoseok as long as fame and fortune were in his future. Once those dreams went out the window, so did their marriage. It had been a loveless one anyway so what was the point?</p><p>Hoseok hadn\u2019t talked to his dad since the split. He\u2019d gotten a couple postcards in the mail from whatever new place his dad had traveled to but he hadn\u2019t gotten one in over a year. And his mom might as well have been absent. She spent some of her time at the studio and most out with strange men. This was the first one she\u2019d brought back to the house, though. A stranger in Hoseok\u2019s home. It made him sick to his stomach.</p><p>He lay down on his bed and unscrewed the cap from his drink as he stared up at the ceiling. His shoulders were achy and stiff, as per usual at this time in the evening. He\u2019d been taking much weaker painkillers just to take the edge off while he went through his detox, but he found that the low dosage was no longer doing enough for him. And he just always wanted to sleep. He wished he could sleep, but the pain kept him awake. The pain in his neck, in his shoulders, his spine.</p><p>With a sigh, Hoseok reached blindly for the bottle of Tylenol on his bedside table. The pills rattled in the container loudly, almost taunting him. <i>Take as many as you want. It still won\u2019t be enough.</i> He popped the cap off and tipped the bottle toward his mouth. Once he felt four land on his tongue, he recapped the bottle and took a swig of his tea to wash it down. He could feel them scrape all the way down his throat, flowing with the cold liquid to settle into the pit of his stomach like rocks.</p><p>He closed his eyes and listened to the familiar sounds of his room. His computer humming softly under his desk, the baseboard heater creaking as it turned on, the muted ticking of his analog alarm clock. These were the sounds that usually kept him awake at night. He could hear the shower turn off in the bathroom\u2014he hadn\u2019t even noticed it until it turned off, the silence becoming more absolute. Namjoon must have been getting ready to go to work. A couple minutes later, he heard the door open and close.</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Namjoon said to him and he opened one eye to see the younger boy coming out in his boxers and using a towel to dry off his pale blonde hair. \u201cHow\u2019s Jimin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean Jungkook?\u201d Hoseok asked sleepily.</p><p>Namjoon crossed the room to where his stuff was. He always kept his corner neat and tidy. He already didn\u2019t like the fact that he was encroaching on Hoseok\u2019s personal space so keeping his stuff as contained as possible was a must. At least in his eyes. Hoseok had told him time and time again that he didn\u2019t mind him staying. That he, in fact, enjoyed the company, especially, on nights when Namjoon was off and would stay up talking with Hoseok when the pain kept him awake.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, Jimin,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Jungkook is getting all the care he needs. Jimin however\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well, Joon,\u201d Hoseok interrupted and closed his eyes again. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing well.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon was silent for a few seconds then sighed. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok swiped his tongue over his bottom lip then sat up quickly. \u201cDid you see my mom brought someone home?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon let out a chuckle as he grabbed his work coveralls out of his stack of neatly folded clothes beside his pillow and stepped into them. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said as he tugged them on. \u201cI scared the crap out of him when I came home from the hospital earlier.\u201d He\u2019d been there keeping Taehyung company for a couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Tae\u2019s trial is the day after tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Hoseok said. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nervous wreck but that\u2019s to be expected,\u201d Namjoon said as he pulled his work beanie down over his head. \u201cJin\u2019s dad thinks he\u2019ll be able to get him off with a temporary insanity claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never caught, were you?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked down at his hands and bit the inside of his cheek. He shook his head. \u201cTae won\u2019t let me confess. He told the police he did everything himself. If I say anything, it could ruin his trial. They\u2019d throw both of us in jail.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said anything as they both mulled over that last statement. Here Jungkook was in the hospital, Jimin was going through his own personal Hell and Yoongi had ostracized himself from the rest of them, not to mention Jin had basically fallen off the face of the earth having not returned for a weekend from school since going to the hospital that first night. Taehyung and Namjoon going to jail would be the nail in the coffin. The group was so close to breaking, it wouldn\u2019t take much more to completely destroy them.</p><p>*</p><p>Namjoon had left a couple hours before and the sounds of Hoseok\u2019s mom\u2019s awful flirting had finally died down, leaving Hoseok alone in the silence. He lay on his back in his bed, the lights off because even though he\u2019d taken that Tylenol, his head was still pounding. With a sigh, he grabbed his phone off the mattress next to him and turned it on. The screen was bright, sending a spike of pain through his eyes and into his skull. He couldn\u2019t dim it fast enough. When the ache subsided a bit, he opened his chat with Jimin.</p><p><b>hows it going?</b></p><p><b>\u2026</b></p><p><b>Jimin: at the hospital. Something happened</b></p><p><b>Wat is it? JK?</b></p><p><b>Jimin: could you come?</b></p><p><b>On my way.</b></p><p><b>*</b></p><p>Hoseok reached the hospital in record time. Faster than the first night. Jimin was alone in the waiting room, sitting in the chair with his head in his hands. When he looked up, his face was red, his eyes shining. Before Hoseok could take another step, Jimin got up, walking over to him as he wiped his face with the sleeves of his oversized sweatshirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hoseok asked.</p><p>Jimin wouldn\u2019t look at him. Instead, he kept his eyes trained on his fidgeting fingers in front of his stomach. \u201cH-he crashed and it took them a long time to get him stable again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know why?\u201d Hoseok asked feeling weak all of a sudden. He reached out to grab Jimin\u2019s arms, more for his own balance than to comfort the younger boy.</p><p>Jimin just shook his head. \u201cThey have to do some sort of exploratory\u2026thing. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre his foster parents here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were here for like an hour, earlier,\u201d Jimin said with a sniff.</p><p>The fact that Taehyung and Jimin were basically living at the hospital while Jungkook\u2019s fake parents had barely made any sort of appearance over the past month had his stomach churning with anger.</p><p>Finally Jimin lifted his head, a bruise becoming apparent on his cheekbone. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hoseok asked nodding toward it.</p><p>Jimin brought a hand up to rub at the bruise. \u201cJiho hit my locker door while it was open and it hit me in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I see this earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI covered it up.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok raked a hand through his hair. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d claim it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok hated Jiho. Hated him more than Jungkook\u2019s fake parents. Hated him more than his dad for abandoning him. Hated him more than his mom for bringing strange men into their home. He used to get his anger out in the studio. It was the only way to help him work through it. Then he relied on his pills. But he didn\u2019t have those anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, Hobi-hyung,\u201d Jimin said at last breaking Hoseok out of his thoughts.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s face fell. He <i>was</i> tired. Always tired.</p><p>\u201cGo home and try to sleep,\u201d Jimin said and pushed him gently backward toward the exit again. \u201cI\u2019ll call you if I hear anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be alone, Jimin,\u201d Hoseok said.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung is on his way.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok couldn\u2019t tell if it was a lie or not but his skin was crawling and he needed some fresh air. So with a sharp nod and one last reassuring brush of his hand against Jimin\u2019s arm, he left.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to go home. He didn\u2019t want to stare up at the ceiling, his mind racing, his body aching as he tried to go to sleep. He didn\u2019t really know what he wanted. But somehow, he ended up at the studio. It looked abandoned. His mom had been working there a lot less, letting it fall to the wayside. But still, just the sight of it filled Hoseok\u2019s chest with warmth. He hadn\u2019t been there in years.</p><p>*</p><p>The sound of the light switch flipping on echoed through the empty studio. Hoseok stood there in the doorway for several seconds as his eyes adjusted to the suddenly bright room. A wall of mirrors loomed in front of him, his gaze meeting the one reflected back at him. He looked terrified. He felt terrified.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t stepped foot in the studio since before his accident. Sure, he\u2019d spent late nights in his room attempting to move the way he used to be able to, but those times always ended in pain and a trickle of angry tears. Those were the nights he\u2019d find himself reaching for his pills, swallowing more than he needed. The high didn\u2019t fill the gaping hole in his chest, though. The place where his passion had once burned bright. As bright as he was.</p><p>Everyone that knew him before his accident would say he was sunshine in human form. He always had a smile on his face that glowed almost as brightly as his sparkling eyes and his golden skin. He looked like a child of summer, made of everything that was pure and warm in the world. But that light had died there in his hospital room. He\u2019d felt it leave his body, as if his very soul had floated away, leaving him feeling cold and empty. The only light he\u2019d felt since then was the illusion created by the pills he took. Artificial sunlight. Nothing but fake happiness that faded with the high and left him exhausted and miserable all night long.</p><p>*</p><p>His footsteps sounded hollow as he made his way over to the speaker system. He plugged his phone into the stereo and shuffled through his music until he came to the right song. Then he picked the small controller up off the top of the stereo and made his way to the center of the room. For several seconds, he stood there in silence, looking at his reflection. It was too bright in the room.</p><p>With a huff, Hoseok went over and shut the lights back off, plunging the room into darkness. Much better. Then he went back and stood in the middle of the floor. With a deep breath, he pushed the play button on the remote and the room suddenly filled with music. The first time he\u2019d heard this song, he\u2019d closed his eyes to listen, his mind immediately conjuring up a stage, he in the middle of it. He\u2019d created a whole routine in his mind, playing the song over and over, using his imagination to move the way his body wasn\u2019t able to. He\u2019d practiced the choreography in his mind hundreds of times and now that he was here, now that his feet were planted firmly on the waxed floor of the dance studio, the music pumping out of the speakers, it seemed that this was the pivotal moment. He couldn\u2019t go back. He couldn\u2019t fail. If he did, this was really it.</p><p>He closed his eyes, feeling the music rise in him like the swell of a wave. It filled his chest then overflowed, spilling down his arms and flowing through his veins like electricity. Something ignited in him like a spark to gasoline and he began to move to the music. Immediately, he felt a twinge of pain at the base of his skull and he jerked, catching the back of his neck with a tensed hand. He dug his fingers into his skin, standing motionless until the pain finally began to ebb. <i>Take it slow, Hoseok,</i> he told himself then carefully rolled his neck from side to side, loosening up the muscle.</p><p>With a deep breath to calm his nerves, he started the song over. This time, he didn\u2019t try to replicate the choreography he envisioned. Instead, he only barely moved, making small motions with his body as he went over the dance in his mind. When the song ended, he did it again, this time letting his limbs make larger movements, though still smaller than he wanted.</p><p>He did this over and over, feeling the music and letting it take control slowly. With every reset, he could feel his movements becoming more fluid, more pronounced. With every roll of his body, he tensed for the pain but since his muscles were having a chance to stretch and warm up, it wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>He moved through the darkness, the light from outside streaming in through the windows lining the wall high above the mirrors and he watched his form in the mirror, slipping in and out of the rays. Like a spirit dancing in shafts of moonlight. Still not perfect but getting closer.</p><p>Hoseok had lost count of how many times he played through the song. He just kept hitting the back button, losing himself in the music until finally, he collapsed onto his back, his mouth stretched into the biggest euphoric smile he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>Maybe this was finally the end of his struggle. Maybe he could finally dance again. Finally live his dream. Finally leave the pain and the pills behind.</p><p>He was tired and he could hear his bed calling his name. With a groan, he got back to his feet. He was going to be sore the next day. Probably for several days after this but he didn\u2019t care. For once, he welcomed the pain.</p><p>When he grabbed his phone and unplugged it, he noticed a notification on his screen. A message from Jimin. It had been sent just a few minutes earlier. Hoseok swiped the message and brought his phone up to read it.</p><p><b>Jimin: I know you tried. I know youve done everything you could. I know I\u2019m letting you down. I\u2019m letting you all down. But I cant do this anymore, hyung. Living hurts too much. Existing hurts too much. Youll be fine without me. All of you.</b></p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heavy breaths echoed through the room as he read the text over and over. At last he started typing out his own message.</p><p><b>What do you mean?</b></p><p>He waited less than a minute before sending another.</p><p><b>Jimin</b></p><p>No response.</p><p><b>Jimin answer me now.</b></p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s hands shook as his thumb tapped Jimin\u2019s name. An option came up to call him and he pressed it. As it rang, he sprinted out of the studio, not even bothering to lock it back up before making his way to his car. Voicemail. With a curse, Hoseok hit redial and got into his car. The engine groaned to life and the tires peeled out as he flew out of the parking lot.</p><p>He called over and over again as he drove to Jimin\u2019s house, not even wasting a second between calls before hitting redial again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jimin,\u201d he growled and hit redial again.</p><p>Voicemail.</p><p>With an angry cry, he threw his phone to the passenger side. It cracked against the window before disappearing down into the space between the seat and the door. <i>Please, let him be okay. Please, let him be okay.</i></p><p>The house was dark when Hoseok pulled up to the curb and jumped out. Jimin\u2019s dad was on a business trip for the next couple of weeks and his mom must have been out because the door was locked when Hoseok tried the handle. He banged on it with his fists, screaming Jimin\u2019s name until his hands hurt and when that got him no response, he grabbed one of the bricks lining the path and smashed it into the window beside the door. Ignoring the jagged glass, he reached in and stretched his arm as far over as he could until he was able to undo the deadbolt. The door rattled as he threw it open and rushed inside.</p><p>The place was dark and silent and Hoseok\u2019s panic grew as he went from empty room to empty room.</p><p>\u201cJimin!\u201d he yelled. \u201cJimin, where are you? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>His feet hit the stairs, echoing loudly as he took them two at a time. He flung open Jimin\u2019s bedroom door, eyes roving over the empty space. His shoulders heaved, his breath coming out in ragged wheezes and he whirled around again to face the hallway. The bathroom door was shut at the other end.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s breath caught. \u201cNo, Jimin,\u201d he whispered before running to the door. He tried the handle. Locked. He hit his still aching fist against it. \u201cJimin!\u201d He rattled the handle until he was sure it was going to come loose in his hand. \u201cNo no no no please no.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he backed up and began ramming against it. Wood splintered with every hit and his shoulder burned but he kept throwing himself against the door until at last, it gave in, swinging open with such force that it banged against the adjacent wall. Hoseok fell in landing hard on his knees. The bathroom was pitch black and he pawed at the wall next to the doorframe, finally finding the light switch and flipping it on.</p><p>The bathtub was filled to the brim with water, and there he was, a dark form beneath its surface. Hoseok surged forward and plunged his arms into the water, displacing so much of it that gallons spilled over the edge, drenching him and the bathmat before spreading across the tile floor and toward the carpeted hall.</p><p>He clutched Jimin to his chest, the boy\u2019s hair plastered over his eyes, his skin deathly pale, his lips blue from lack of oxygen.</p><p>\u201cJimin,\u201d Hoseok cried shaking the boy. He lay him on the ground and started pushing hard against his chest. He\u2019d never performed CPR before and he hoped to God he was doing it correctly. Though maybe it didn\u2019t even matter anymore.</p><p>After a few pushes, he pressed his ear against the boy\u2019s chest. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jimin,\u201d he grunted then grabbed the boy by the chin and the top of his head and bent down to try mouth to mouth. Jimin\u2019s lips felt cold and dead against his own but still he tried forcing air into the boy\u2019s lungs. Then he started doing compressions again.</p><p>He switched between the two over and over, his hope fading the longer Jimin went without responding. Tears streamed down his face and his own chest was beginning to ache from taking in such deep breaths to give to Jimin, but he couldn\u2019t stop. He couldn\u2019t give up. Jimin had to live. He had to be alright.</p><p>What could Hoseok do? He needed to call for help. He needed to find a phone. His own cellphone was still wedged between the seat and the passenger side door in his car, but he knew Jimin\u2019s parents had a phone in their room just next door. Should he stop doing CPR? Should he keep going until Jimin\u2019s mom got home? Who knew how long that would be? It would only take a second. Just two steps out of the bathroom, two down the hall and three to get into the bedroom and grab the phone. Then seven back. Could he make it? Could Jimin make it? He didn\u2019t have any other option.</p><p>With a silent plea, Hoseok leaned down to give Jimin one more breath before tearing himself away from the boy. He scrambled across the hall, grabbing the phone off of the nightstand and rushing back to start compressions again. He used one hand to continue to push against Jimin\u2019s chest as hard as he could while his other hand shakily dialed 911. Once the phone was ringing, he dropped it the floor so he could use both hands again.</p><p>\u201c911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease help,\u201d Hoseok said, his voice breaking on the second word. He dropped his head onto Jimin\u2019s chest as a sob racked through him. \u201cPlease come. He\u2019s not breathing\u2026\u201d</p><p>Through the anguish, Hoseok lifted his head again and continued pushing on Jimin\u2019s chest. He could barely hear the operator on the other end but he rattled off the address anyway and then went back to alternating between compressions and breathing into Jimin\u2019s mouth.</p><p>His strength was diminishing. His vision tunneling. Everything was fading and Hoseok knew. He just knew that it was no use. He should just stop. Just come to terms with the fact that Jimin was gone. That he\u2019d failed the boy. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop. It was almost robotic by this point. His body was long passed exhaustion but he couldn\u2019t quit.</p><p>A few minutes later he heard the faint sound of sirens approaching and looked up to see red lights flashing on the ceiling from outside the window. Relief didn\u2019t reach him though as Jimin was still unresponsive.</p><p>\u201cAnyone here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp here!\u201d Hoseok yelled, his voice hoarse.</p><p>A couple seconds later, two blurry shapes rushed into the bathroom, one pulling Hoseok away while the other replaced him doing CPR. Hoseok let the paramedic pull him out of the bathroom and collapsed against the carpet in a tired, wet heap. He couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t see. He could barely think. All he could do was breathe and pray with the last ounce of energy that Jimin would wake up.</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Hoseok finally gained enough strength to sit up, the paramedics had already taken Jimin away in the ambulance. Before they had gone, one paramedic had sat at the top of the stairs with him and asked him some questions. If he knew what happened. How long he\u2019d been doing CPR. He couldn\u2019t answer. He had no idea how long he\u2019d been there. Had no idea how long Jimin was underwater. He wished he knew something.</p><p>After a few more questions that Hoseok didn\u2019t know the answer to, the paramedic gave him a small card with his contact information on it and then they left. Hoseok sat in the dark at the top of the stairs for a long time debating on if he should stick around and wait for Jimin\u2019s mom to get home or not. He didn\u2019t want to. He didn\u2019t want to be in the house anymore. He was soaking wet and cold and exhausted and he just wanted to sleep forever.</p><p>His whole body hurt but somehow he still managed to get to his car and drive home. His mom must have still been out on her date and Namjoon was still at work so the house was silent. Hoseok stumbled into the bathroom, yanking his shirt off over his head and letting it drop to the floor. It hit the tiles with a wet slap.</p><p>His reflection stared back at him. His eyes were dull, defeated, unemotional. He felt as hollow as he looked. Every inch of him was tired. His body felt weak. His thoughts muddled. He could feel himself shutting down. He wanted to sleep. Needed to sleep. Needed to just be done with it all.</p><p>Hoseok reached up and opened the medicine cabinet. He stood there in silence, his eyes scanning the rows of pill bottles until they settled on the bottle of Benadryl. His mom suffered from seasonal allergies so she took these pretty regularly throughout the spring and summer. They always made her really drowsy. Perfect.</p><p>He brought the pill bottle down from its shelf and squinted in the dim light at the writing on the label. Disclaimers jumped out at him. <b>Caution.</b> <b>Warning.</b> <b>Danger</b>. None of those words held a negative meaning for him. They were promises. Promises of sleep.</p><p>With unsteady hands, he popped the cap off and tilted the bottle toward his open hand. The pills rained down, some slipping through the cracks between his fingers and disappearing down the drain but most of them collected in his palm. By the time the bottle was empty, he held a pile of small white pills. With one more glance at himself in the mirror, he lifted his hand and poured them into his mouth. It took several painfully dry swallows but he eventually choked them all down. Then he carefully replaced the lid and put the bottle back in its place on the shelf before leaving the bathroom and walking calmly down the hall to his room.</p><p>He lay down on his bed and closed his eyes. Images of Jimin\u2019s colorless skin filled his head. The boy\u2019s lips had been so cold and so dead. He didn\u2019t even look like him. Jimin used to be such a warm person. So happy even amidst his struggles. After Hoseok\u2019s accident, he\u2019d thought his life was over. He\u2019d lost all hope. But Jimin had pulled him up out of the darkness. He\u2019d been the last remaining glimmer of sunlight for Hoseok to cling to. His ray of sunlight. His little Jimin.</p><p>As he released a tired sigh, Hoseok felt a tear slip from beneath his eyelid, drawing a cold trail down his cheek. Without even realizing it, he\u2019d relied so much on Jimin. Relied on his joy, on his positivity, on the promise Jimin made on Beach Day after Hoseok had dumped his pills into the fire.</p><p><i>We\u2019ll help you through this, hyung.</i></p><p>The boy had hidden his own pain so Hoseok wouldn\u2019t see it.</p><p><i>I\u2019m rooting for you.</i></p><p>Hoseok\u2019s face twisted and he threw his arm across his eyes as the despair crashed over him. He could feel his chest tightening, his lungs seizing as his heart hammered against his ribs. Thoughts of the other boys flooded his mind. Images of Taehyung\u2019s boxy grin and lanky arms slung over Namjoon\u2019s shoulders to his bloody hands and haunted eyes. Of Jungkook\u2019s sparkling eyes and playful jabs to him lying in his hospital bed with wires and tubes sticking out of him. Of Jimin. Jimin. Sweet Jimin, golden-skinned and running on the beach to limp and lifeless, his wet, hair matted to his pale face.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t know if I can take much more.</i></p><p>Another sob clawed its way up Hoseok\u2019s throat, shaking the whole bed and he pushed his palms against his eyes. His breath was coming too fast, his thoughts pounding through his head like strikes from a sledgehammer. He\u2019d clung to that last ray of sunshine, that last hope, with white knuckled fists and then seeing Jimin there in the bathtub, watching his body being toted away by the paramedics, Hoseok felt it slip through his grasp. He could feel the light receding, feel it shrinking back like the tide. The darkness was taking over, creeping in like a slow moving poison. Taking over his mind, tinging his fingers black. His stomach was a churning mess. And at his center, a blackhole.</p><p>With one last shuddering breath, Hoseok relaxed completely. The drugs started to take affect and his heartbeat slowed, the ringing in his head, the cacophony of thoughts ebbing until nothing mattered anymore. </p><p>Nothing mattered.</p><p>He lay there in silence, his eyes still covered by his palms and just listened. Listened to his computer humming under his desk and the baseboard heater creaking as it warmed up and the little analog alarm clock on his nightstand. These sounds used to keep him awake all night, along with his racing thoughts and his sore neck. But now he didn\u2019t feel any pain. He was too exhausted to think. And the sounds became a last comfort that lulled him into a deep, endless sleep.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad985a2e4d26543fd87599c5f017cbbc/tumblr_inline_plrisuBP2L1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp0zjHYU1qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>09. Love Is Not Over</b></h2><p><b>Present Day.</b></p><p>Jin slams his palms down on the hood of the truck and rests his forehead against the cold metal. \u201cJust, please, God,\u201d he utters. \u201cPlease let them all get here.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t heard from any of them since he left and only found out about Jimin and Hoseok from his parents. They didn\u2019t tell him until he returned because of course they assumed he\u2019d been in touch with his friends the whole time. Were they still his friends? After everything that happened, was there still anything between them? Were they even all still alive?</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s outburst back in March had felt like a punch to the gut. Jin had never held anything over their heads. He never thought he was better than any of them. The fact that Yoongi would say such a thing had cut him to the core. He hasn\u2019t talked to Yoongi since that night. In fact, besides updates from his dad about Tae\u2019s trial, he didn\u2019t hear about any of them while he was in Japan. Living unaware all summer, staying preoccupied with program activities while his friends were suffering at home. It makes him feel even sicker.</p><p>The ocean matches the churning in his stomach and he gulps hard, tears pricking his eyes as he glances down at his watch. Their usual meeting time has come and gone. He turns his head either way, looking down the stretch of empty beach in both directions. No one is coming.</p><p>Jin lowers his head again to rest it against the hood of his truck. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. Everything has slipped through the cracks and it\u2019s all his fault. He should have done more. He should have helped Taehyung the first time Namjoon came to him. He should have been there more for the others. For Jimin and Hoseok, Jungkook and Yoongi. For Namjoon. He knew the boy was sleeping in the gas station and he just let him.</p><p><i>What\u2019s wrong with me?</i></p><p>They were all dealing with so much crap yet somehow they still had so much fun together. They loved him, they cared about him, they laughed with him. He didn\u2019t deserve friends like them. He doesn\u2019t deserve any of what he\u2019s been given in this life. If he could, Jin would give it all away. He\u2019d trade anything to see his friends again. To hear their voices, to hold them close. But it\u2019s too late. He knows that now.</p><p>The wind whips the hair at the back of his head, blowing down the collar of his shirt, and leaving a trail of goosebumps down his back. He doesn\u2019t move even though he\u2019s freezing. He doesn\u2019t deserve to feel warmth. Not when it\u2019s his own fault that the world has grown so cold. He lifts his head, gaze falling on his red notebook, the pages fluttering. With a hard sniff, he picks it up, slamming it shut and trudges toward the shoreline. He stops at the edge, just out of reach of the tide and looks out at the water. In the distance, waves crash violently. He watches them fold into each other in a salty spray, crumbling under the weight of gravity. He feels like crumbling, himself. Maybe he could just walk in, keep going until the current sweeps him off his feet and pulls him under. He could let the sea wash him away.</p><p>Far away.</p><p>He looks down at the journal clutched tightly in his hands. A gift from his parents. They always believed in him. Always knew he\u2019d make something of himself some day. None of it matters to him anymore, though. He doesn\u2019t want to become a famous writer. He doesn\u2019t want to marry some perfect girl and have a perfect family and live a perfect life. He just wants his friends back. Nothing else matters. Not his career. Not his future. Not this stupid journal and everything it represents.</p><p>With a frustrated sigh, Jin grips the journal in one hand and draws his arm back behind his head. He\u2019s about to fling it as far out into the water as he possibly can when movement to his right catches his attention. With a jerk of his head, he locks eyes with Yoongi.</p><p>The boy freezes where he stands about ten feet from Jin\u2019s truck. He looks different. His hair is black instead of the mint green making him look even more pale than he already was. He seems smaller too, though maybe that\u2019s because he\u2019s standing next to the vast ocean.</p><p>Jin can\u2019t think of anything to say at first. Instead, he just stares, afraid that if he makes any sudden movements, the boy will disappear. But then at last, he finds his voice. \u201cYou came,\u201d he utters.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s shoulders relax and he brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s Beach Day,\u201d he replies with a shrug.</p><p>Jin nods before turning and running to him, throwing his arms around the boy. Yoongi\u2019s own arms wrap around him, squeezing him tighter than Jin thought his strength could allow. A strangled cry falls from Yoongi\u2019s mouth, muffled by Jin\u2019s sweater.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hyung,\u201d Yoongi cracks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for everything I said. I didn\u2019t mean any of it. I was drunk and pissed off and tired\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all true,\u201d Jin interrupts. \u201cI\u2019m the worst friend. I could have done more to help. I should have done more. You can blame me. I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi finally steps back, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his coat. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all screwed up.\u201d</p><p>The two don\u2019t say anything for a while, Yoongi looking down at his feet in shame and Jin just watching him because he can\u2019t believe his friend is here. His chest still feels warm where the other held onto him. It still feels like a dream that he\u2019s just waiting to wake up from.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to the others at all?\u201d Jin finally asks. He\u2019s been dreading asking the question but he has to know. \u201cHow\u2019s Jimin? How\u2019s Hoseok? Are they\u2026\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looks up at last to meet his eyes. \u201cWell, uh\u2026Hoseok\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two talking about me?\u201d</p><p>Jin spins around, the momentum swinging his arms too far and causing him to stumble as he turns to face the source of the voice. Hoseok stands there, alive and golden-skinned, Namjoon trailing a bit behind him kicking at the sand, hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cHobi?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s lips curl into a warm smile, his eyes glittering and he makes his way closer, opening his arms invitingly. Jin steps into them, not completely believing that this is real. But the boy is warm, warm as a ray of sunshine and Jin closes his eyes, feeling the calm wash over him. The last he heard, Hoseok had swallowed a bottle of pills, but here he was, in the flesh, alive. Alive and warm and solid. Jin pulls his bottom lip into his mouth and bites down against the tight feeling in his throat.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Hobi?\u201d he asks weakly then pulls back to look the boy in the eye.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s own bright eyes are brimming with tears but he smiles through them and nods. \u201cI\u2019ve been in rehab since June but yeah, I\u2019m doing better.\u201d Then he puts his hand on Jin\u2019s arm and squeezes gently. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Jin nods. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Namjoon says coming up behind Hoseok. He stayed back to give the two some time but he couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>He missed Jin too and it\u2019s apparent by the way he pulls him against him. When they part, Jin looks him up and down. He seems so much more put together than the last time he saw him. His skin looks healthier, the bags under his eyes are gone and his clothes look nice. He looks less ragged, so much more put together.</p><p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d he says to the younger boy.</p><p>Namjoon nods, his dimples becoming prominent as he smiles. \u201cI feel good.\u201d</p><p>Jin nods back then his eyes shift over the boy\u2019s shoulder, looking past him back down the beach again. He\u2019s afraid to ask where the other three are. He wants to know what happened to Jungkook, to Jimin. His dad had told him that they\u2019d won Taehyung\u2019s trial, the jury finding him not guilty by way of temporary insanity and self defense and the boy and his sister had gone to live in the country with relatives. At least he can find some comfort in knowing one of his friends is safe. But not knowing of the others\u2019 fate overshadows that greatly. Slowly, he turns back to Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJin-hyung!\u201d</p><p>Jin spins around, his eyes scanning the beach frantically for the source of the voice. At last they fall on a shape running at him. He can\u2019t quite tell who it is by the blur of tears suddenly covering his eyes but a smile spreads across his face anyway as he watches them make their way down the slope of the hill parallel to the water. And then he feels his throat close up, a sob trying to push its way out when two more figures appear at the crest and quickly start their descent. He breaks into his own run, the wind pulling the tears from the corners of his eyes, his heart hammering in his ears as he nears them. Jin barely has time to register Jungkook\u2019s beaming face before he crashes into him, gripping the boy tight as the force of the collision sends them sprawling to the ground in a tangle of limbs. He manages to choke out only the first of many apologies when the breath is knocked out of him by two more crushing bodies.</p><p>\u201cWe missed you, Jin-hyung,\u201d Taehyung yells in his ear</p><p>\u201cYou were gone for so long,\u201d Jimin adds.</p><p>It\u2019s all too much for Jin to handle and he crawls out from under them, sitting back on the sand and burying his face in his hands as he sobs. Immediately, the others\u2019 hands are on him, their cheeks pressed against his head, his shoulder, his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m s-so sorry,\u201d he chokes out and sniffs hard. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I left you all. I\u2019m so s-sorry I wasn\u2019t there when you guys needed me. I\u2019m s-so\u2014\u201d he lifts his head at last, his eyes meeting Jimin\u2019s. The boy looks different. Good different. His hair is dark, his skin golden, his brown eyes shining brightly. Jin cups the younger boy\u2019s face in his hands. His cheeks feel fuller than they have in a year. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. You\u2019re alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright, hyung,\u201d Jimin assures him with a warm smile. \u201cI\u2019m still in recovery but I\u2019m alright.\u201d</p><p>Jin turns to look at Jungkook. \u201cYou\u2019re walking,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d the youngest replies with a relieved laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve been in physical therapy all summer. Yoongi-hyung came back from Seoul to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>Jin looks back where Yoongi stands with the other two, his mouth set in an amused smile as he leans back against the truck watching them. \u201cWhat about the producing job?\u201d Jin asks him.</p><p>Yoongi shrugs. \u201cThere will be other openings. This was more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMina and I are living on my aunt\u2019s strawberry farm, hyung!\u201d Taehyung chimes in and Jin can\u2019t help but burst into laughter at the boy\u2019s boxy grin that seems to take up his whole face.</p><p>The other three join him on their backs in the sand, dissolving into laughter that\u2019s perhaps a bit more hysterical than necessary. It\u2019s hard not to be overwhelmed with everything. It\u2019s all too much and yet Jin never wants it to end.</p><p>At last the laughter dies down and a heavy silence falls over the group. Jin sits up again, his eyes locking with Yoongi\u2019s. The boy\u2019s mouth tugs up into a sad smile. He still must feel guilty. <i>It\u2019s alright,</i> Jin thinks. <i>That\u2019s all in the past and we can start fresh now.</i> <i>I\u2019ll never leave any of you again.</i></p><p>*</p><p>They spend Beach Day the way they have every year in the past. Together. </p><p>The air is chilly, the wind sharp, but Jin doesn\u2019t even feel it. Instead, warmth blooms in his chest as he watches his friends enjoy themselves and that keeps the cold away. The temperature drops as the sun sets and, as always, they build a fire on the beach by the truck. The orange flames lick at the night air, casting a warm glow on the boys\u2019 faces. They all look happy and it\u2019s the most beautiful thing Jin has ever witnessed. Sure, Beach Day must always come to an end. Sure, they\u2019ll have to get up tomorrow and face what lies ahead but they\u2019re together again. And they\u2019ll carry each other through whatever obstacles they\u2019ll face. And there will be many. Such is life.</p><p>Jin gets up from his spot between Yoongi and Jimin and brushes the sand off his jeans as he makes his way back to the truck. He opens the door and reaches in to grab his red notebook off the seat where he\u2019d set it earlier. It\u2019s so much colder out of reach of the fire and he sucks in a sharp breath through his teeth, bracing his shoulders against the chill as he carries his notebook to the front of the truck and lays it open on the hood. The moon shines bright, casting a cold glow over everything but what the fire\u2019s warmth reaches. And by this cold light, Jin flips his notebook open to the page he\u2019d been writing on earlier and uncaps his pen.</p><p><i>Let\u2019s not be like the vase shattered on the floor. Let\u2019s be stronger than the glue that takes these fractured pieces of our lives and puts them back together. Let\u2019s be the bond that never breaks.</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f8b045db3a6d222d515a10c54991bde/tumblr_inline_plriuagtyO1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"203\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp1n1zq81qe89j5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1507\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><h2><b>Epilogue: Young Forever - by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSORlND-r3SZhjW7WEt8dTA\">@dimpled-gukkie</a></b></h2><p><b>Three Years Later.</b></p><p>Jin climbs the steps of the apartment building, slowly making his way to the fourth floor. He can already hear voices seeping through the thin apartment walls and into the hallway, filling the fourth floor with the comforting voices of his best friends. Before he can even put the key in the door to his apartment, the one directly across opens. </p><p>\u201cHyung!\u201d </p><p>Jin nearly falls over as a newfound weight lands on his back, a small set of hands wrapped around his shoulders. \u201cWe missed you so much, we\u2019re starving!\u201d </p><p>Jin huffs before pulling the hands away from him and opening his door. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d His voice is teasing, the tone you use when trying to coax a child into using manners. </p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Jimin whines while smiling so wide that his eyes are basically closed, smushed by his chubby cheeks. Jin has to resist the urge to pinch them, happy to see that they are no longer hollow like they were a few years back. </p><p>He pretends to ponder his answer before \u201creluctantly\u201d sighing and swinging his door wide open. \u201cI guess I can make you something.\u201d </p><p>In reality, Jin knows that if he doesn\u2019t make food for the group, they\u2019ll most likely starve or order pizza for every meal. The rest seem to lose all brain cells when in the kitchen if the many near disasters are anything to go by. Jin distinctly remembers the time Namjoon not only burned one of his favorite pans but Jungkook also managed to get potatoes stuck to a plate and defied all laws of gravity. </p><p>\u201cJin Hyung is making dinner!\u201d Jimin yells into the hallway beckoning the rest of their friends to Jin\u2019s small apartment. The first to rush out are Taehyung and Jungkook, which is no surprise as they both never stop eating. Pausing in the doorway, Jin waits for the rest to arrive before sighing as the other two apartments on the floor remain occupied. </p><p>\u201cAre Hobi and Yoongi still working on their mixtapes?\u201d Jin asks as he begins pulling pots and pans out of the cupboards. As a college student struggling to not accumulate student loan debt, all he has to make is an unhealthy amount of ramen. Jin proceeds to pick through his numerous flavors of packaged noodles when the door opens. Before Jimin can open his mouth to answer, Yoongi enters. </p><p>\u201cWow, Jin hyung. Look at you, you\u2019re a true college student.\u201d Jungkook snickers nearly earning him a whack on the back of the head. </p><p>\u201cYah! You should be nice to the one who\u2019s making you food.\u201d Jin chides before pouring water into the pot. He can hear Jimin softly scolding Jungkook to be nicer to his hyung and smiles. Jiminie has always been such a sweetheart. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the mixtape going?\u201d Jin asks Yoongi while filling the pot with water. He glances in Yoongi\u2019s direction while turning off the faucet to make sure that the boy is actually taking care of himself. Yoongi had a habit of throwing his health aside for his music, but hopefully with Hoseok working alongside him, he will take care of himself.</p><p>To Jin\u2019s relief no dark under-eye circles contrast Yoongi\u2019s pale skin, a result of not venturing outside for five years. Yoongi only begins to answer when Jin is once again facing the stove. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s where I want it to be though. It feels incomplete.\u201d The maknaes fall silent listening to their hyung\u2019s worry, not sure exactly how to help since they have no knowledge of music composition. </p><p>\u201cHave you had Hobi listen to it yet?\u201d Jin asks pouring salt into the pot of water and turning on the stove. The faster he can get the water boiling, the faster he can cook the noodles, which means the faster they can eat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not quite sure either though. We just spent two hours listening to the tracks on repeat to try and see what\u2019s off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe you need another voice on your track, hyung? I would gladly volunteer.\u201d Taehyung smiles. Ever since Hoseok and Yoongi created Cypher Records, Taehyung who\u2019s their biggest fan, has been asking to be on a song every time it\u2019s brought up. Secretly, the duo have planned a song out just for Taehyung to feature on, but it\u2019s a gift for his birthday. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought about asking Namjoon hyung?\u201d Jungkook pipes up, munching on dry ramen. They all turn to face him, giving him questioning stares at his choice of a snack. He shrugs. </p><p>\u201cI guess I could ask Namjoon. Maybe having someone not directly involved in composition would help.\u201d </p><p>Jungkook smiles wide, bunny grin on display from the pride of helping a hyung. A few years ago, after Hoseok and Yoongi had begun creating their record label, Namjoon quit his janitorial job in favor of running the business side of the label. Since he\u2019s the only member of the group who\u2019s held a real job, Yoongi and Hoseok thought that he would be best. Namjoon ran everything from promotions to contracts and anything in between. He was the one running the hustle, meanwhile Yoongi and Hoseok were the face of the company. Although some may hate being only known in the background, Namjoon is happiest there. </p><p>Namjoon and Hoseok enter at last, the final two of the group of seven. The boys cheer when they enter and pull two chairs over. They all sit huddled together in silence, the sound of boiling water filling the room. It\u2019s a comfortable silence. The type you get after being with someone for so long, and Jin feels himself relax after a long day of classes. That is until Jungkook starts munching on another dry ramen packet. </p><p>\u201cYah! Can you just wait?\u201d Jin yells exasperatedly. Jungkook pouts in response before slowly putting it down on the counter. </p><p>\u201cHe eats all the time, hyung. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised.\u201d Jimin says, ruffling Jungkook\u2019s hair affectionately. </p><p>\u201cYeah, ever since he started playing intramural sports he\u2019s always hungry.\u201d Tae laughs before taking a bite of the dry ramen. \u201cYuck! How are you eating this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Jungkook mumbles. \u201cI gotta feed these muscles.\u201d Flexing his bicep, he gives it a slap for extra measure causing the boys to fall in a fit of giggles.</p><p>\u201cJungkook-ah put your muscles away, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d Tae says. While Jungkook focused on becoming a muscle man, Taehyung has been more focused on eating the delicacies of life. Because of his new affinity for food, Tae and Jin have developed a stronger bond through their love of trying new dishes. Although, Taehyung does make sure to eat a handful of strawberries a day; they remind him of his days with his aunt and sister on the strawberry farm after the trial. </p><p>\u201cAlright, children, dinner is ready,\u201d \u00a0Jin says pulling dishes down from the cabinet. One by one, the boys pile noodles into their bowls before settling around the living room. There\u2019s only a small table in the kitchen that seats four, so they sit in a circle sprawled across the floor and couch. They\u2019re all silent, focusing only on eating after a long day of classes and work, until Jungkook starts slurping the remnants in his bowl. </p><p>\u201cDid we adopt a toddler?\u201d Jin remarks. </p><p>\u201cWe adopted two.\u201d Namjoon pinches Jimin\u2019s cheek that\u2019s stuffed with noodles. Jimin\u2019s eyes go wide and a blush paints itself across his cheeks as he turns his gaze away. </p><p>\u201cI think if we\u2019re being honest, we\u2019re all just overgrown toddlers,\u201d Yoongi adds. </p><p>The boys all scoff and he rolls his eyes. Yoongi likes to think he\u2019s an adult. That he\u2019s finally outgrown his childish fears and that he\u2019s become more mature. But when he sits among his group of friends he still feels like he\u2019s a teen, mind filled with wonder and the feeling that nothing\u2019s impossible. It feels like everyday is Beach Day with the boys by his side. Like he\u2019ll never have to be alone like he was back in Seoul. </p><p>\u201cThat would explain why I saw Jin throw his psychology textbook across the room yesterday and throw a tantrum,\u201d Hoseok says. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand! I have to memorize all the Psychosocial Stages. There\u2019s too many to remember,\u201d Jin whines, glaring at the textbook lying on the coffee table. </p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about going back to creative writing? I feel like you were happier then,\u201d Hoseok responds. </p><p>\u201cNo, I like psychology. It\u2019s just a much harder subject. I think with psych I\u2019ll be able to actually help people. I can save them from what you all went through. I can almost make up for not being there.\u201d The boys fall silent, each face more stoic than the next. Jin rubs his hands together nervously. </p><p>\u201cWe forgave you a long time ago. You don\u2019t need to do this to pay us back.\u201d Namjoon reaches over to give a comforting squeeze on Jin\u2019s arm. </p><p>\u201cI-I know. I want to do this, though. Besides, if you ever do need me again, I\u2019ll be able to help.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell we appreciate it, hyung.\u201d Hoseok smiles. \u201cOn a less serious note, I\u2019ve rented my mom\u2019s old studio. I was thinking of holding dance lessons when I\u2019m not helping Yoongi hyung in the studio.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them!\u201d Jimin yells. Ever since getting into college, Jimin has been trying to bulk himself up. He wants to be able to defend himself and not have to rely on Jungkook and Taehyung to save him. He doesn\u2019t want to have guard dogs anymore; he just wants them to be his friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them too!\u201d Taehyung yells from the kitchen, digging around the fridge for the carton of strawberries he keeps hidden. </p><p>\u201cHow about we all take them? Hobi can get some practice in teaching unskilled students and we can learn how to dance. I\u2019d like to not look like the inflatable long-limbed man outside of car dealerships.\u201d Namjoon chuckles. </p><p>\u201cBold of you to assume I don\u2019t know how to dance,\u201d Jin says. </p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Namjoon retorts. </p><p>\u201cNot the point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell if we\u2019re mentioning new stuff we\u2019re doing, I\u2019ve decided to get into photography,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cI\u2019d like to capture the good moments of my life so I can forget the bad.\u201d \t</p><p>Jungkook looks at Taehyung before quietly saying, \u201cstill getting the nightmares?\u201d </p><p>Taehyung nods. \u201cThey\u2019re not as frequent but every now and then I get them. They just stay with me a while. I think surrounding myself with physical copies of happy memories would help in keeping them from plaguing my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take one right now?\u201d Jimin suggests and Tae nods enthusiastically before dashing towards his apartment. </p><p>When he returns, a large camera is in his hand and he sets it on top of Jin\u2019s psychology textbook. It\u2019s so thick that it puts the camera at least two inches above the coffee table. </p><p>After about two minutes of Taehyung yelling: \u201cmove left, no my left!\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re too far, you\u2019re only half a body now\u201d, \u201cJimin you can\u2019t sit in the back no one can see you\u201d, everyone fits the frame. Setting on the self timer, Taehyung launches himself across the laps of Jimin, Hoseok, and Yoongi who\u2019re all sitting in front since they\u2019re the smallest. They let out small huffs but still hug Taehyung to their bodies. The flash goes off and they all clamber back towards the camera to see the photo. </p><p>Thankfully, each boy is in frame and no one was accidentally decapitated. Staring at the photo, with the boys wrapped together in a tight hug, Jin feels warm. This right here is his family. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s not by blood or that they split apart at one moment, because Jin knows they\u2019ll always fall back together. They\u2019re like magnets, no matter how far they pull away, they\u2019ll always reconnect eventually.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"208\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ce66b521ba7c779ff02ec2ad756876a/tumblr_inline_plriy8h5v01qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"208\"></figure></p>",

Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment In Life</b></h2><p>Jin stands on the beach, arms resting on the hood of his truck as he stares out at the ocean. The bitter wind whips his hair in his eyes and fills his head with the smells of salt and seaweed. You&rsquo;d never know it&rsquo;s the end of &nbsp;summer. The sky is an anemic gray, the water dull and choppy. Its chaotic churning matches the whirlwind in his stomach. His fingers shake and he can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s from the cold or the anxiety that seems to pulse through him like a live wire.</p><p>He&rsquo;s been gone all summer, doing a program abroad in Japan and he&rsquo;s supposed to start his third year of university in just a couple weeks. But here he is on the beach because they always meet up here. It&rsquo;s tradition. Every summer they mourn/celebrate the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. They spend the day at the beach, goofing off, having a big bonfire and staying out all night. It&rsquo;s always been like this. All seven of them, together every year. Even though they hang out all season, the annual end of summer beach day seems almost like a reunion of sorts.</p><p>But after everything that happened&hellip;will any of them even show up? Jin feels the blood drain from his face as the terrible thought he&rsquo;s been trying to avoid suddenly appears in his mind. Will anyone <i>not</i> show up?</p><p>With a quick clench of his fists, he pushes off his truck and runs his hands through his hair. He&rsquo;s been absent this summer, even before then he was going to school full-time and was really only able to see his friends on the weekends and some holidays. And with how little he saw them, they all seemed worse every time he came around. There was nothing subtle about the change in each of their lives. And nothing he could do to help them. He watched each of them slip further and there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>There was nothing he could do.</p><p>With each passing week, the gap between he and the others grew and before too long, he felt like an outsider, a fly on the wall observing rather than being a part of it. And then that whole thing with Yoongi. With Tae and his dad. And Jungkook and Jimin&hellip;and Hoseok&hellip;</p><p>He sucks in a sharp breath, his heart clenching like a cold fist in his ribcage as he stumbles to the cab of his truck and throws the door open. He rummages for a few seconds through the food wrappers and trash on the floor on the passenger side before finding his red notebook. Then he slams the door shut again, drops the journal open on the hood and begins to write.</p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>Do you remember how it used to be? How we fit like a seven piece puzzle? Chaotic and messy on our own but a perfect picture when we were together&hellip;</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e1e64d5e71c4589422ce26aed1d979e/tumblr_inline_plrieo6tIs1qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp3xbm2p1qe89j5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>02. Hold Me Tight</b></h2><p><i>We were nothing until we became something. And we were only something when we were with each other.</i></p><p><b>One Year Ago.</b></p><p>Kim Seokjin sat in the bed of his truck, back against the cab, his red journal propped up on his legs as he scratched his pen across the lined paper. He&rsquo;d always loved writing. It was why he&rsquo;d decided to become an english major. This notebook had been a gift from his parents, inexpensive but meaningful. A symbol of their support of him pursuing a passion with little promise of fame or fortune. He didn&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s what he loved.</p><p>Every so often, he lifted his eyes from the page and stared out at the ocean. At the expanse of sea, glittering in the sunlight. Beach day was always his favorite day. Sure, it signaled the end of the summer, and the air, though still warm, carried the faintest bite of autumn, but it was a day for him to spend with his six best friends. The ones that he&rsquo;d shared his life with for the past five years. Sure, his friendship with them looked different now than it did back then. Life had been a harsh beast, threatening many times to rip them apart but they always prevailed and their bond had become stronger every time because of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Jin-hyung!&rdquo;</p><p>Jin tore his eyes from the water to look further down the beach and a smile spread across his face when he saw two obscured figures making their way toward him. One tall and lanky, the other shrouded in a black hoodie. Namjoon and Taehyung.</p><p>He climbed out of the bed of his truck and tensed his body as the two younger boys reached him and lunged, each throwing their arms around him and causing him to stumble back.</p><p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think we haven&rsquo;t seen each other in a decade.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung smiled, his mouth shaping into a rectangular grin that the rest of the boys had come to love. &ldquo;Another year, another Beach Day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then you&rsquo;re off to school again tomorrow,&rdquo; Namjoon added mussing up the older boy&rsquo;s hair.</p><p>Jin ducked out from beneath his arm and patted his hair back into place. &ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m moving across the country. I&rsquo;ll still be around.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Much less though,&rdquo; Taehyung said. &nbsp;Jin&rsquo;s eyes lingered on the ugly purple bruise blooming around the boy&rsquo;s left eye, at the cut on his lip that split open when he had smiled. With a quick swipe of his sleeve, Taehyung wiped the blood away that had welled up. How many stains were hidden by the dark fabric of his black hoodie?</p><p>The three of them heard more shouts and laughter and turned to find their other four friends running toward them, hair and clothes whipping in the harsh wind. A few more yards and the seven of them were together again, as it should be. As it always should be.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook-ah&rdquo; Taehyung yelled to the youngest boy as he flung his arms around him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you so!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; Jungkook yelled back and dramatically threw his body against him in a crushing hug. &ldquo;Where have you been all my life?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung looked again to Jin. &ldquo;See?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Jungkook-ah gets it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin could only laugh as he watched the hug turn into a power struggle in the sand. The wrestling match quickly became a dog pile as Jimin, the third youngest, jumped on top, followed by Hoseok and finally the second oldest, Yoongi. Namjoon, more of a lover than a fighter, stood back with Jin, arms folded across his chest as he looked fondly down at their friends.</p><p>They spent the day together there on the empty beach. Seven friends drawing messages in the sand, racing each other along the shore, eating junk, wrestling and laughing, their normal lives forgotten, washed away by the crashing waves. By the time the sun was setting, their throats hurt from screaming, their limbs ached, their eyes burned but it was the happiest they&rsquo;d been all year. It was a day to forget the present and live in the good times of the past and the possibilities of the future.</p><p>It grew dark. Not pitch dark. A bright darkness that made the sky a cobalt blue and everything else a crisp black. All they could smell was the tang of sea salt, all they could hear was the breaking of waves as they all lay in the sand and looked up at the stars. The world seems to spin a bit slower at night. The temperature had plunged when the sun set and when they finally couldn&rsquo;t stand the cold anymore, they built a bonfire right there on the beach.</p><p>For hours the seven of them joked around, brought up funny memories, burst into song and played games, the punishment always the same, taking a dip in the frigid ocean. Before long, all of them were damp, their hair plastered to their foreheads in wet, salty strands. At last, sleepiness began to settle over the group, sending them all into silence. No one wanted to acknowledge that Beach Day was coming to a close. Everyone dreaded returning to the real world the next day.</p><p>After several minutes of silence passed, Hoseok finally sucked in a sharp breath and got to his feet. &ldquo;I brought something,&rdquo; he said digging into his pocket. When he pulled his hand back out, it was wrapped around a plastic baggie of pills. The rest of the group watched with bated breath. &ldquo;I feel like this is a good moment to start over,&rdquo; he said as he watched the flames lick at the cold air. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s a better way to start over than getting rid of the temptation entirely, right?&rdquo; His eyes lifted to peer around the circle. The others nodded, a few of them giving him small smiles of cautious encouragement. The boy had been struggling with addiction for years. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;d decided to quit cold-turkey. But they all clung to the hope that it was the last.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you through this, hyung,&rdquo; Jimin said with a determined nod. Hoseok smiled back, his eyes glittering at the promise.</p><p>Then with his own definitive nod, he opened the baggie and turned it upside down over the fire. The others cheered as his smile became wider. At last he stuffed the empty bag back in his pocket and fell back down into the sand. Yoongi clapped him hard on the back and Jimin leaned into him, nuzzling his side until he lifted his arm and slung it over the younger&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>Jin smiled from where he leaned against the tailgate of his truck, his eyes scanning his circle of friends. The next morning he was heading off to college. Sure, his dorm wasn&rsquo;t far and he planned on coming home on the weekends but&hellip;</p><p>His eyes flew to the dark bruise on Taehyung&rsquo;s face, to the pale, sallowness of Jimin&rsquo;s cheeks, to the threadbare places on Namjoon&rsquo;s old clothes, to the dark stress circles under Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes, to Jungkook wearing Yoongi&rsquo;s sweatshirt providing him the comfort he doesn&rsquo;t often receive at home</p><p>&hellip;he couldn&rsquo;t help but worry about them. They had a much rougher life than he did and though he did what he could to help, he was afraid that life was getting the best of them. And there was only so much he could do to try and keep their heads above water before he too might sink and they all would drown.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b01174d4d534042dd630624274c053fe/tumblr_inline_plrii1jMao1qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrovgkPsj1qe89j5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>03. Autumn Leaves</b></h2><p><i>Apart, we were fragmented but together, we were unbreakable. And that was all we needed. Until it wasn&rsquo;t.</i></p><p><b>November.</b><br /></p><p>School had always been hard for Park Jimin. Luckily, the fact that Jungkook and Taehyung were almost constantly by his side made it bearable. They were his best friends and protectors against those that liked to pick on him because of how small he was. It wasn&rsquo;t his fault that when the other boys hit puberty, they sprung up like weeds while he stayed closer to the ground. Though the taunting, the name calling, the abuse, made it feel to him like it was his fault. Like he should have tried harder, thought bigger, been stronger.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to feel good enough when the world tells you that you never will be. Even the medication didn&rsquo;t help much. The constant taunting throughout the years had worn him down. Chipped away at his meager self-confidence until there was nothing left to help but a razor blade and a bottle of sleeping pills. That didn&rsquo;t work. And after he&rsquo;d gotten out of the hospital and gone through treatment and promised his parents he&rsquo;d continue going to therapy and taking his anti-depressants, he turned to the one thing he wasn&rsquo;t too weak to control. Food. Everyone else already thought he was small. Maybe if he made himself small enough, he could just disappear entirely. If nothing else, the smaller the target, the harder it is to hit.</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook and Taehyung were like his fortress walls. Taehyung already dealt with his alcoholic father so fighting off a few bullies at school was nothing to him, and the stress of being in foster care had driven Jungkook to the school&rsquo;s weight room and onto the field so just his appearance was intimidating enough to keep others away. &nbsp;There were still the whispers though. They&rsquo;d seep into Jimin&rsquo;s head, constantly reminding him that if anyone ever found the chink in his armor, he was done for. Living in constant fear was exhausting.</p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s parents had gone to the principal about it but he said nothing could be done if it wasn&rsquo;t happening on school grounds. And of course, bullies are smart. They&rsquo;d taunt him in the halls and then wait in the shadows to pounce. They&rsquo;d only gotten to him once before, a day that Taehyung was in the hospital with a broken arm and Jungkook had to stay after for detention, and after that, his parents started picking him up. They&rsquo;d talked of homeschooling him but couldn&rsquo;t make it work. But Jimin assured them, as long as he had Taehyung and Jungkook, he&rsquo;d be okay.</p><p>And so the three of them were a unit. You rarely saw one without the other two. They&rsquo;d worked it out with the principal for at least one of them to be in every class with him. It had been that way since middle school. Now here they were their senior year. It was nearing the end of November now with no incidences so far. Only seven more months to graduation. &nbsp;Jimin could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Have you talked to the guidance counselor about your dad?&rdquo; Jimin asked Taehyung as they sat together in the cafeteria. The taller boy had come to school that morning sporting a new blackening bruise on his cheekbone.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head and stuffed a piece of broccoli into his mouth. &ldquo;You saw what the principal did about your situation. You think a teacher is going to be able to do anything about mine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could always come home with you one day,&rdquo; Jungkook said as he sat down in front of his tray. &ldquo;The two of us could give him a taste of his own medicine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Taehyung uttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better not to provoke him. He doesn&rsquo;t get like this very often. It&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin and Jungkook exchanged knowing glances. &ldquo;Not very often&rdquo; had turned into Taehyung sporting a new cut or bruise every week. It was getting worse and they all knew it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to stay at my house tonight,&rdquo; Jimin asked.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head and pushed a pea around his tray with the tines of his fork. &ldquo;No, Mina is going to be home tonight and it&rsquo;s best if I&rsquo;m there too. You know, to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Jungkook cut him off.</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s younger sister spent most nights at her friends&rsquo; houses, luckily she was popular and had a lot of friends to be able to do this with. But on those nights where she was home, Taehyung always made sure to be there, just in case their dad decided to drink. Jimin remembered Taehyung staying at his house one night back in middle school and the next day at school seeing Mina with a black eye. His friend swore to never leave her home alone again after that and he&rsquo;d kept that promise.</p><p>&ldquo;Better eat your vegetables so you can grow big and strong.&rdquo; Jimin looked up to see Jiho and a few of his friends sitting at the table across the aisle. The guy hadn&rsquo;t gone one day without tormenting him since sixth grade.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think midgets can grow big and strong,&rdquo; his friend, Kijung, retorted from beside him.</p><p>The rest of the table laughed while Jiho stared directly into Jimin&rsquo;s eyes, a vicious smirk on his lips.</p><p>Jimin quickly looked away again, a shudder running down his spine. &ldquo;Did either of you finish your calculus homework from last night?&rdquo; he asked as he grabbed his backpack off the bench next to him and began digging into it.</p><p>Jungkook and Taehyung ripped their eyes away from the other table and locked on each other, forks hovering just outside their mouths. Of course they didn&rsquo;t do it. With a roll of his own eyes, Jimin pulled out his text book and opened it to the assigned pages. He&rsquo;d been using his homework as a bookmark and now laid it on the table for the two to see. He ran a hand through his newly dyed orange hair as Jungkook and Taehyung fumbled with their own backpacks and searched for their notebooks so they could copy down his work.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, guys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What would you do without me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably fail math,&rdquo; Jungkook uttered and pulled the smaller boy&rsquo;s homework closer to him so he could hastily scribble down the answers.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the brains, you got the brawn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I get?&rdquo; Taehyung asked looking up with his mouth full of rice.</p><p>Jimin looked down at his barely touched tray of food, over to Jungkook&rsquo;s somewhat normal sized lunch and then to Taehyung&rsquo;s tray piled high with everything on the line. He smiled fondly. &ldquo;The appetite,&rdquo; he finally said before picking up a piece of melon and nibbling off a corner.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to stay over tonight?&rdquo; Jungkook asked Taehyung as the three of them made their way out of the school.</p><p>Taehyung shook his head. &ldquo;Nah, I&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;ll call you if anything changes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t. I used up my minutes for this month and Fake Dad refuses to buy me more.&rdquo; He always referred to his foster family as his fake family. Fake Mom, Fake Dad, Fake Brother 1, Fake Brother 2&hellip; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hanging out with Yoongi-hyung though after this so just call him if you need to reach me.&rdquo; Then he brought up a hand to shield his eyes from the sun. &ldquo;Jimin-ah, isn&rsquo;t your mom picking you up today?&rdquo; Jungkook asked, his eyes scanning the row of cars that were idling on the curb.</p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s own head moved along before his gaze settled on a dull, yellow hatchback. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Thursday,&rdquo; he said and lifted an arm to wave at the driver. &ldquo;Hobi-hyung and I have group therapy.&rdquo;</p><p>An arm stuck up from the opposite side, hanging out the driver&rsquo;s side window and Jimin hitched his backpack higher on his shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you guys tomorrow,&rdquo; he said to his friends before jogging over to Hoseok&rsquo;s car and slipping into the passenger seat. Then with a horrible grinding sound of metal on metal and a shudder, the car pulled away from the curb.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going, hyung?&rdquo; Jimin asked as he positioned his backpack on the floor between his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Just fine, kid,&rdquo; Hoseok replied gripping the wheel with white knuckles.</p><p>It had been a few months now since Beach Day when the other six had witnessed him dump his pills into the bonfire, but even now he looked like he was feeling the lingering effects of withdrawal. Dark circles stained the skin under his eyes and his complexion looked pallid. Not at all the usual golden color. The boy who was normally a perfect depiction of sunshine, had become overcast. He looked exhausted.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sleeping at night?&rdquo; Jimin asked.</p><p>Hoseok glanced at himself in his rearview mirror and immediately straightened up. As if he could hide what Jimin had already picked up on. &ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough.&rdquo;</p><p>Obviously the boy didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it. Jimin had told him he&rsquo;d be there to help in any way that he could but how could he if Hoseok refused to let him?</p><p>The two had been friends for five years but really bonded in the hospital while Jimin was recovering from his suicide attempt and Hoseok was going through his latest bout of rehab. They&rsquo;d connected immediately, both lost souls having been seeking comfort in the wrong things. Going to group therapy together and encouraging each other in their battles with their demons had brought them closer together. And then when they both had finished inpatient treatment, they stayed close. Sure, Jimin had Jungkook and Taehyung but he&rsquo;d always have a special connection with Hoseok. He was the older brother Jimin had always needed. It was hard seeing his hyung struggling so much. He hated when any of his friends were hurting. None of them deserved it.</p><p>With his lip caught between his teeth, he pulled his phone out of the side pocket of his backpack, opening a text conversation with Yoongi.</p><p><b>Party at ur place tmrrw? Hobi needs us</b></p><p><b>Yoongi: Sounds good. Spread the word</b></p><p><b>thnks hyung</b></p><p><b>Yoongi: Np</b></p><p>*</p><p>After group therapy, Hoseok brought Jimin back to his house, pulling up to the curb and putting it in park. The two sat in silence for several seconds as the engine idled, Jimin chewing on the inside of his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it true, hyung?&rdquo; he finally asked quietly. &ldquo;Is the pain really back?&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok drummed this thumbs against the steering wheel, his eyes glued to the dash. His pale lips pressed into a thin line and he gave a sharp nod. He looked ragged. More so than Jimin had seen him in a long time. Or maybe he just hadn&rsquo;t noticed. Hadn&rsquo;t noticed the stress lines creasing his young face. Or the way his mouth turned down. Or how his shoulders slumped forward as if his struggles were literally crushing him under their weight. Jimin felt the guilt like a fist grab his stomach and twist hard.</p><p>When they&rsquo;d first met, Hoseok was an incredible dancer. The guys had all gone to a couple of his shows and even as a high schooler, his moves had been impressive. Jimin always loved the idea of dancing but felt it would just be another thing to add to the long list of things he was bullied for. The last thing Jiho needed was more material.</p><p>And then, one night during rehearsal, Hoseok had tripped backward off the stage, falling several feet to the auditorium floor and landing on his neck. He&rsquo;d suffered a pretty bad spinal injury and the doctors weren&rsquo;t even sure if he&rsquo;d ever be able to walk again. Luckily, he regained his ability over the course of a few weeks, but the pain lingered in his neck and spine. He began to rely on pills to help but he kept taking them even after the pain finally subsided. The guys had gotten used to him being high. In fact, if he wasn&rsquo;t, he wasn&rsquo;t Hoseok. He was a zombie, a shell, lifeless and hollow. But with the pills, he was full of energy, down for anything. Fun.</p><p>After throwing the pills in the fire during Beach Day, he&rsquo;d gone through the initial withdrawal period. Every time Jimin saw him, he looked like death, but as time went on, he began to resemble the Hoseok they knew before all of this. The one that could be happy and hyper without the high. But maybe it had been an act. An exhausting act, but one nonetheless. And now the pain was back.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to go back to the pills again, are you, hyung?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you be disappointed in me?&rdquo; Hoseok asked, finally looking over at him. The sadness in his eyes said it all. He&rsquo;d been fighting hard, suffering in silence for several months and now he looked ready to give it all up.</p><p>Jimin lifted his hand and put it over the older boy&rsquo;s where they rested on the steering wheel. His fists were clenched so tight, they felt like steel under Jimin&rsquo;s own soft palm.</p><p>&ldquo;I would never be disappointed in you, hyung,&rdquo; he replied, keeping his voice steady and strong so Hoseok knew he meant every word. &ldquo;You could completely relapse and I&rsquo;d never be disappointed in you. Recovery is hard. Addiction is hard. We have bad days and we have worse days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some days are unbearable,&rdquo; Hoseok whispered. &ldquo;I know our therapist says to take it a day at a time but&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forget what the therapist said,&rdquo; Jimin interrupted. &ldquo;If taking it a day at a time is too much, then take it an hour at a time. Or a minute or a second. As long as you make an effort, you&rsquo;re winning, hyung. And we&rsquo;re all rooting for you. I&rsquo;m rooting for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s grip on the steering wheel loosened under Jimin&rsquo;s hand and the boy looked at him. A spark flashed through his tired eyes. Something like determination. A newfound desire to keep going. &ldquo;Thanks, Jimin,&rdquo; he uttered and gave him a weak smile before looking away and sniffing hard.</p><p>Jimin gave the older boy&rsquo;s hands a quick squeeze before pulling his own back and snatching his phone up out of his lap. His fingers danced across the screen as he typed.</p><p><b>party tonite?</b></p><p><b>&hellip;</b></p><p><b>JK: alredy here</b></p><p><b>T: Mina&rsquo;s gone. i&rsquo;m down</b></p><p><b>NJ: see u then</b></p><p><b>Y: </b>&#128077;</p><p><b>J: Leaving now.</b></p><p>Hoseok glanced down at his phone where it rested in the cupholder, the screen lit up with the group message. Jimin&rsquo;s breath hitched when he saw the corners of the boy&rsquo;s mouth twitch upward then he watched as Hoseok shifted the car back out of park and glanced over his shoulder to check for other cars.</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>With a smile, Jimin unlocked his phone again so he could let his mom know he would be home later. She sent back a thumbs up and a heart as they turned at the end of the street and headed toward Yoongi&rsquo;s place.</p><p>*</p><p>The second oldest of the group lived in a cluster of train cars in a yard near the river. He&rsquo;d made a sort of deal with the owner a while back that he&rsquo;d help maintain the place in exchange for somewhere to live. As long as he didn&rsquo;t bring shady people around or do anything illegal, the owner didn&rsquo;t bother him.</p><p>This was where the seven friends congregated. It was their home away from home&mdash;for some even more home than their own. A place any of the six could go and they would never be turned away.</p><p>The night descended into chaos much like it regularly did. It always started out tame enough. A few of the guys&mdash;usually the youngest three&mdash;would crowd around the small tv that sat on Yoongi&rsquo;s coffee table, playing old Atari games, while a few of the others would just talk in the kitchen area, hunched over a pizza box. The older four being of legal drinking (and purchasing) age each usually supplied some type of alcohol and would experiment with mixing them. It would pretty much go downhill from there.</p><p>This night was no different. At one point, Jimin was jumping up and down on the couch with Taehyung, the two screaming the lyrics to the techno-y song filling the room when he was smashed in the chest with a pillow. Feathers exploded into the air and he sprawled off the couch and onto the plywood floor, his fuzzy head swimming even faster as he looked around dazedly for the source of the assault. At last, his eyes focused on Hoseok&rsquo;s beaming face and he narrowed his own at him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on, hyung,&rdquo; he growled before grabbing a cushion off the couch and swinging it up hard.</p><p>Suddenly, the rest of the boys joined, grabbing whatever stuffed object they could find and before long, the place looked like a plushie and feather factory had exploded. Cotton and feathers covered every surface and the boys were rolling in fits of howling laughter. Jimin felt higher than a kite even as he lay among the feathers and fluff, Hoseok laying on his arm.</p><p>But once the laughter died down, a heavy silence fell over the place and within minutes, most of the guys were passed out drunk where they&rsquo;d landed. Jimin, however, pulled his arm out from under Hoseok and sat up on his haunches. He swayed with sleep, fighting it hard. He needed to go home. The other boys were in situations where their absence probably wouldn&rsquo;t even be noticed. Even Hoseok&rsquo;s mom&mdash;out on dates most nights ever since her divorce from his father&mdash;probably wasn&rsquo;t wondering where he was. But Jimin&rsquo;s parents were different. With his past and his problems and the bullying, they had come to worry a lot more easily about him. They always trusted he was safe when he was with the guys but if they expected him home, he had better come home.</p><p>He could have texted. He could have called and his mom or dad would have come and picked him up, no questions asked. But instead, he decided he&rsquo;d rather not bother anyone and make the short trek home.</p><p>It was a stupid idea. It was stupid. It was stupid and he knew it in his gut but his head was too numb to realize just how stupid and so he wobbled to his feet, stood there for a second to regain his balance and then slipped out the door and into the frigid night, alone.</p><p>*</p><p>He would have been fine had he stayed on the sidewalk. Just kept walking and not stopping until he was safe inside his house. But as he walked past the minute mart two blocks from home, his head lifted and his eyes locked on a rack of chips through the window. He had eaten barely anything all day and they sounded so good and he found himself veering off the path and pushing his way through the glass door, inside.</p><p>He may have even been fine if he&rsquo;d just grabbed the chips, paid for them and left. Even if he&rsquo;d tripped on the welcome mat once he was inside, <i>or</i> fumbled with his wallet for a few seconds, <i>or</i> dropped a bill while he was trying to stuff his change back into it, he would have been okay. But the fact that he did all of those things instead of just one, meant that a car was pulling up to the curb just as he was exiting the store. Just a few seconds longer and he would have been hidden again by the shadows and the occupants of the car wouldn&rsquo;t have even glanced his way.</p><p>But instead, he stumbled out the door, the driver&rsquo;s eyes immediately catching the movement, and his lips twisted into a malicious grin as he set his sights on Jimin.</p><p>&ldquo;Where you goin, midget?&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s blood turned cold at the familiar voice and suddenly it was as if the alcohol vanished from his system. He turned slowly, his mind no longer sluggish, but racing. And when he saw that three others were climbing out of the car along with Jiho, his stomach twisted and he felt bile rising in his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave me alone, Jiho,&rdquo; he cracked and swallowed hard.</p><p>The bigger boy laughed and folded his arms over his chest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see your guard dogs anywhere,&rdquo; he said and made a point to look around. &ldquo;Getting a little brave, are we?&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin didn&rsquo;t waste another second to respond. Instead, he twisted around and took off running down the sidewalk. His heart pounded in time with his sprinting footsteps and staggered when the sound of his pursuers reached his ears. His breath became ragged in his throat and his body tingled with fear. He reached the end of the block and whipped around the corner, his shoes skidding on the sidewalk and he almost lost balance but regained it quickly, using his hands to push himself back up. There was an alley just a few yards ahead and beyond that, he could see his house. He was almost there. Relief flooded his body as his eyes locked on his front porch.</p><p>And then he felt a hand grab his hood and tug hard.</p><p>Jimin flew backward, a cry ripping from his throat as his body hit the pavement. And then more hands were on him, yanking him back up and shoving him into the dark alley.</p><p>*</p><p>Jimin finally found the strength to pick himself up almost twenty minutes after Jiho and his friends left him there in the alley. His whole body trembled and he couldn&rsquo;t catch his breath. He didn&rsquo;t know if that was from the multiple kicks to the chest or if he was in the middle of a panic attack. Either way, he fought for air for what felt like an eternity before finally being able to breathe normally. After making his way slowly back to his house, he unlocked the door and nearly fell into the entryway when he twisted the knob while still leaning against it for support.</p><p>The house was quiet and dark and surely, his parents were in bed. He didn&rsquo;t want to wake them. He didn&rsquo;t want to spend any time assessing the damage done by Jiho and his lackeys. He just wanted to sleep. So, he crawled in pain up the stairs on his hands and knees, down the hallway and then climbed into bed with his torn clothes and shoes&mdash;shoe? When did he lose the other one?&mdash;praying he didn&rsquo;t die of internal bleeding or a concussion in the night.</p><p>*</p><p>When he woke the next morning, he stiffly shuffled into the bathroom to finally see how he looked. Awful. That&rsquo;s how. His bottom lip was swollen on one side, a deep cut slicing through it and down into his chin. There was blood crusted below his nose and several cuts and scrapes on his face. One eye was swollen practically shut, the skin around it a sickly green color. He had a big slice on one ear and bruises resembling fingerprints on his neck. His ribs ached and it hurt to breathe and when he lifted his shirt, he found his chest and stomach stained purple and black.</p><p>There was no way he could go to school like this. So he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>He texted his mom from his room, telling her he felt extremely sick and couldn&rsquo;t get out of bed. She offered to stay home from work to take care of him but he insisted she leave. And his dad had left that morning for a week-long business trip. He was safe. Surely, over the weekend, most of the bruises and cuts would heal enough that they wouldn&rsquo;t be too noticeable come Monday. He&rsquo;d just have to avoid his mom. He texted Taehyung and Jungkook that he&rsquo;d gotten sick and would see them on Monday. He could put this whole thing behind him. Hopefully. He just needed to be more careful from now on.</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook&rsquo;s nostrils flared, and the line of his jaw became prominent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill him,&rdquo; he snarled, his eyes roving over the students in the hallway as he searched for Jiho.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, no,&rdquo; Jimin said softly and he brought a hand up to rest on the trembling boy&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>Even though it was now Monday, the slice on his mouth hadn&rsquo;t healed as much as he&rsquo;d hoped. His eye was no longer swollen but was surrounded by a fading yellowish bruise. He looked better though. Good enough that he could hide it from his mom by wearing a hat and some makeup and keeping his head down.</p><p>At his touch, Jungkook immediately loosened, his face smoothing over again and he met Jimin&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Why did you go back home alone after the party? Why didn&rsquo;t you wake me up? Or Tae? Or any of us? We would have gone with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin raked his teeth over his bottom lip, wincing when he felt a sharp sting. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was stupid. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking. I&rsquo;m stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stupid, Jimin,&rdquo; Taehyung said quickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever say something like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin nodded. He couldn&rsquo;t believe it though. He&rsquo;d done an incredibly idiotic thing going out alone like that. Of course, something bad would happen if he did something so careless. He deserved it. Of that, he was positive.</p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5387390292888c67ed81d701ce8f7f91/tumblr_inline_plrijyKlN81qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrovxqrpf1qe89j5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>04. Run</b></h2><p><i>Life began to get to each of us.</i></p><p><b>January.</b></p><p>December came like a quick intake of breath and went like a heavy sigh. Once the cozy feeling of the holidays was over, winter became harsh and merciless. An icy fist that squeezed and squeezed until there was no warmth left. Taehyung was used to it though. He&rsquo;d never liked winter. Not since his mom had died just after Christmas his fifth year. Mina had been too young to remember her, being only three years old, but Taehyung could remember her perfectly still, as if he&rsquo;d talked to her just the day before.</p><p>He and his sister used to stay up late a lot&mdash;at least whenever they were both home&mdash;curled up on their shared bed, facing each other, covered in two layers of clothes and three blankets because their father turned the heat way down whenever he wasn&rsquo;t home, which was often. Not often enough though in Taehyung&rsquo;s opinion. But they would lay like that for hours and Taehyung would tell Mina stories about their mother. He didn&rsquo;t have many spectacular ones&mdash;being he really could only remember a few from such a young age&mdash;but once those ran out, she started asking him simpler things. What did mom look like? What did she smell like? What did she sound like? Feel like?</p><p>&ldquo;She looked like spring, smelled like flowers, sounded like rain and felt like sunshine.&rdquo; How else could he describe her? Maybe his memories were clouded by the happier life he&rsquo;d lived with her in it but he&rsquo;d rather have this version of her in his mind. He needed it. Needed something good to cling to.</p><p>*</p><p>The first time his father had hit him, he&rsquo;d apologized profusely afterward, and made Taehyung promise he&rsquo;d never tell a soul. He didn&rsquo;t. And he didn&rsquo;t the second and third time either or any time after that. He&rsquo;d never told anyone, other than his friends and only because they grew suspicious of the bruises and the injuries and his unexpected late night calls asking if he could sleep over.</p><p>Over the years, he became good at reading the signs and predicting when his dad was going to have an outburst. If he got home from work and slammed the door behind him, it was time to retreat to the bedroom and bolt the door. If he came with a freshly bought bottle of alcohol, it was time to leave. Taehyung&rsquo;s only reason for not moving out was Mina. He&rsquo;d made a promise to her and himself that he&rsquo;d always be there to protect her, even if that meant taking the brunt of the abuse himself. Which it always did.</p><p>He&rsquo;d ended up in the hospital a few times keeping his dad away from his sister, stepping in the way of the punches, even tackling the man to the floor to give her a chance to run. It always ended badly but he never complained. Not when it would be so much worse for her. She didn&rsquo;t deserve to live in fear like this. He didn&rsquo;t either but especially not her. He at least had good memories of their mother. She only had the nightmares that came with having a monster for a father.</p><p>When things got too hard, his friends were his escape. Five of them had their own problems. And five of them had families that would get suspicious if he came around too often and he couldn&rsquo;t risk anyone going to the police and tearing him away from his sister. The one person he could always count on to help and be his safe place was Namjoon.</p><p>The boy was an orphan living secretly at the gas station where he worked. Taehyung didn&rsquo;t have to hide anything from him. In fact, there were countless times in the past where he&rsquo;d show up at the gas station pounding on the door at two in the morning, broken and bleeding and Namjoon wouldn&rsquo;t say anything. He would just let him inside and make room for him on the small twin blow-up mattress he dragged out of the broom closet every night. And if he was too worked up to sleep, the two would go out into the city and find something to do. This usually involved spray paint and a concrete wall. More than once the two found themselves running from police sirens, having been caught mid-tag. Namjoon wasn&rsquo;t the best influence but he was what Taehyung needed.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; the older boy said holding out a pint of ice cream to him.</p><p>Taehyung looked down at it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like eating ice cream right now, hyung,&rdquo; he uttered and swiped his tongue across the fresh cut on his lower lip. The taste of salt and iron grated against his tastebuds. His whole head hurt from the evening&rsquo;s beating. He was ninety percent sure he had a concussion.</p><p>&ldquo;For your lip,&rdquo; Namjoon replied dropping it into his hand.</p><p>Taehyung winced when he touched the cold container to his wound but immediately started to feel the pain fade as his lip began to go numb.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I overslept this morning,&rdquo; Namjoon said as he grabbed a lollipop from the rack on the counter beside where Taehyung sat and unwrapped it.</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Mr. Bang-nim found me this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he say anything about all this?&rdquo; Taehyung asked gesturing toward the mattress on the linoleum floor.</p><p>&ldquo;He said if he finds me sleeping here again, I&rsquo;m fired.&rdquo; Then he stuck the candy in his mouth and twirled the stick between his fingers.</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s stomach dropped when he saw the unease written across his hyung&rsquo;s face. The boy had nowhere to go. Taehyung would have invited Namjoon to stay with him but of course he&rsquo;d never want to subject one of his friends to the hell he had to deal with every day. Though it didn&rsquo;t matter either way. Namjoon didn&rsquo;t like asking for help. He wanted to be the one his friends came to, not the other way around. The boy was independent and stubborn to a fault.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have to be more careful,&rdquo; Namjoon said with a shrug. Of course he was only acting like it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. Taehyung knew better.</p><p>Light flooded the dim store as a vehicle pulled into the parking lot and Taehyung felt his heart skip at the idea they were going to be caught. But when he looked out through the storefront window, relief flooded his chest. Jin&rsquo;s 4x4 truck sat idling in front of the gas pumps.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d they&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I texted him a bit ago,&rdquo; Namjoon interrupted, a gentle smile lifting his mouth and causing his cheeks to dimple.</p><p>Taehyung hopped off the counter and set the pint of ice cream down before making his way outside. Jin rolled the driver&rsquo;s side window down, music pouring from inside the cab. The other boys&rsquo; voices rose above the singer&rsquo;s vocals as they screamed along to the song.</p><p>&ldquo;Long time no see,&rdquo; Taehyung said slapping the oldest boy&rsquo;s hand when he stuck it out the window.</p><p>Jin smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been a week, Tae,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Taehyung shrugged. &ldquo;A week is an eternity in this town.&rdquo;</p><p>The smile on Jin&rsquo;s face faltered for a second and Taehyung noticed his eyes trail down to the younger&rsquo;s wounded lip. He quickly swiped his tongue across it to catch the remaining blood. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Mina?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Taehyung said. &ldquo;At a sleepover.&rdquo;</p><p>The oldest boy&rsquo;s eyes lingered on his for several moments before he finally gave a small nod. &ldquo;Hop in,&rdquo; he said and motioned with his head toward the back of the truck.</p><p>Taehyung scrambled over the side and dropped into the bed beside Jimin, who sat with his back against the cab, happily cramming chips into his mouth from a bag. &ldquo;Want some?&rdquo; he asked as he offered the bag to him.</p><p>&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; Taehyung said and barely got settled beside his friend when the truck lurched forward and they pulled back out of the gas station.</p><p>It was pretty late and almost every food place was closed save for the all-night diner they frequented. There was nothing quality or good about the food there but it was cheap, and greasy and filled their bellies. The waitresses had come to grow fond of them over the years, knowing each of them by name and favorite flavor of milkshake.</p><p>The seven of them were the only ones there, which was a good thing since they tended to get a bit rowdy. Their plates had just barely been delivered when Yoongi decided he was going to try and cheer Taehyung up by throwing a handful of french fries at Jungkook. A food fight quickly broke out between the two and the poor waitress had to dodge away to keep from getting hit by a rogue fry.</p><p>They spent hours there, stuffing their faces and drowning their problems in ketchup and grease until finally, none of them could bring themselves to take one more bite. Then they made their way sleepily back to the truck, Taehyung flopping into the bed again, this time with Namjoon, and letting his head fall onto the older boy&rsquo;s lap. The gentle rock of the truck as it made its way down the road and the streetlights that passed intermittently overhead made his eyelids droop dangerously low. He probably shouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep if he really did have a concussion, but the sound of the engine, the warmth of Namjoon&rsquo;s thigh pressed against his cheek and the comfortable weight of food in his belly made it impossible for him to keep his eyes open and soon he drifted off completely.</p><p>*</p><p>Taehyung woke to the strong smell of coffee wafting into his nostrils and he opened his eyes to a chipped ceramic mug inches from his face. Jimin smiled warmly from the other side. It took Taehyung a few seconds to figure out where he was and why his body was aching so bad until he shifted and realized he&rsquo;d slept all night in Yoongi&rsquo;s bathtub.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t like coffee,&rdquo; he uttered, batting his friend&rsquo;s hand away.</p><p>&ldquo;It woke you up, though, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Jimin asked. His voice was much too cheerful for this time of morning. What time was it anyway?</p><p>Taehyung raked his hand through his greasy hair. &ldquo;How long have I been out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost noon. You should eat something, Tae,&rdquo; Jimin said and offered his hand to help the boy climb out of the tub.</p><p>Panic rushed through him like ice water. &ldquo;Noon?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I need to get home. I need to be there when Mina gets back from her sleepover.&rdquo; He tripped out of the bathroom and through the living room, past the other boys crowded around a table as Jin tried to build a house with a deck of cards.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up!&rdquo; Jungkook exclaimed throwing his arms up.</p><p>&ldquo;JK!&rdquo; Jin yelled, his hands frozen in midair. &ldquo;Stop with the sudden movements!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I gotta go,&rdquo; Taehyung said as he rushed past. The gust of wind he created caused Jin&rsquo;s card house to collapse and he let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>Taehyung didn&rsquo;t stop though. As soon as he was out of Yoongi&rsquo;s home, he broke into a run and kept running until he burst through the front door of his apartment. His eyes scanned the empty front room. Liquor and beer bottles littered the kitchen counters, junk mail piled high on the table and scattered on the floor around it. The place was a dump but that wasn&rsquo;t out of the ordinary. The quiet, however, was. He barely took a step when a whimper cut through the silence and then suddenly he was running again. He paused in the hallway, eyes on the shadows moving in the room at the end. The door was barely cracked open so he couldn&rsquo;t see who was in there. But then he heard a choked cry. Mina.</p><p>Taehyung flew back out of the hall and wrapped a fist around the first thing he could grab, a beer bottle, then charged back down the hall, bursting into the bedroom just as his father&rsquo;s hand connected with his sister&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch her!&rdquo; Taehyung roared shoving him back hard.</p><p>His dad stumbled back more in surprise than pain and he stared at the boy with wild, glazed over eyes. The man reeked of alcohol even at this early hour of the day. He bared his teeth and looked like he was about to lunge. But Taehyung didn&rsquo;t give him the chance. He rushed forward instead, swinging the beer bottle back and sending it crashing down on his dad&rsquo;s skull. The man staggered again, this time stunned by the blow. The bottle had broken when it came in contact with his head.</p><p>Taehyung could have stopped there. He could have grabbed his sister and turned and ran, maybe taken her back to Yoongi&rsquo;s. The other boys would be able to help them. But no, the sight of his dad striking her had caused the time bomb within him to finally detonate and now he knew nothing but rage. With a scream that sounded too far away to be coming from his own lungs, Taehyung surged forward again, jabbing the broken bottle into the soft flesh of his father&rsquo;s stomach. He felt it lodge deep in the man&rsquo;s belly and a sickening groan fell from his father&rsquo;s lips but it did nothing to keep Taehyung from stabbing him again and again until blood soaked the front of the man&rsquo;s t-shirt and coated his own hands and clothes.</p><p>In the chaos, he couldn&rsquo;t hear anything but his own gasping breath and the cries that continued to tumble from the man in front of him until his dad finally collapsed to the floor. Then his sister&rsquo;s screams reached his ears, her voice already going hoarse from yelling for so long. With a violent shudder, Taehyung staggered back, letting the broken and bloodied bottle fall from his hand and clatter to the floor. His mouth fell open in a silent scream and his knees gave out. As he fell to the floor, his sister caught him, sobbing into his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; Taehyung uttered. &ldquo;What have I done, Mina? What have I done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You saved me, Tae,&rdquo; she cried into his neck. &ldquo;You saved us.&rdquo;</p><p>Their father lay motionless in front of them, the red spreading across his shirt until you could no longer tell what color it had been originally. It seeped down into the carpet, a dark stain that would never fully go away.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to leave, Mina,&rdquo; Taehyung said, his voice shaking so hard it came out as barely a whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Tae,&rdquo; she cracked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have to.&rdquo; He grabbed her hard by the shoulders and pulled her down in front of him. His eyes drilled into hers. She had their mother&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You have to get somewhere safe. I can&rsquo;t come with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you have&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our dad is dead!&rdquo; Taehyung screamed. &ldquo;Our dad is dead and I killed him!&rdquo;</p><p>A whimper fell from Mina&rsquo;s mouth and for the first time, Taehyung noticed the bruises welling up under he skin. There were so many. How long had their dad been hitting her before he&rsquo;d gotten there?</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Mina,&rdquo; he said more gently. &ldquo;Please, go to a friend&rsquo;s house. Tell them dad isn&rsquo;t here and neither am I and you don&rsquo;t know where either of us are. Please. I&rsquo;ll come for you when it&rsquo;s safe. But until then, you have to go.&rdquo;</p><p>Mina nodded, her head jerking up and down erratically as she tried and failed to keep whatever last bit of composure she had. Then suddenly, she fell against him, a wail tearing from her throat and he clutched her to his chest, tears streaming down his own cheeks. His hands were coated still in his father&rsquo;s blood and he raked his fingers through his sister&rsquo;s hair, holding onto her, pulling her closer, smelling her, feeling her against him. Who knew if he&rsquo;d ever see her again?</p><p>Mina changed her clothes and washed the blood out of her hair from when Taehyung had held her, before rushing out of the apartment. He didn&rsquo;t go outside but watched her from the front window. She&rsquo;d texted a friend and asked them to pick her up and now he watched as she got into their car, her head lifting, her eyes locking on his one last time before she climbed into the the backseat and then she was gone.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know what to do. That moment of clarity when he&rsquo;d needed to get his sister away was gone and now all he could do was stare at the messy living room in shock. With his back pressed against the door, he sank down onto the carpet, his hands catching him as he fell. His hands. Covered in sticky, drying blood. His father&rsquo;s blood. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>A murderer.</p><p>His head began to pound as the thoughts swirled in his brain. It was all too much. Everything was too much. The coppery smell of blood filled his nose, filled his head, filled the room and it overwhelmed him. His hands shook and his breath hitched and he couldn&rsquo;t inhale deep enough. Too much. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>His eyes watered and his nerves were shot and he was numb but could feel everything at the same time and it was overwhelming. His skin crawled and his heart hammered and his lungs were on fire and he couldn&rsquo;t breathe and he squeezed his eyes shut as if he could shut out the world and it was all too much. He killed his father. He was a murderer.</p><p>A murderer.</p><p>*</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, it was dark. He didn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d fallen asleep or passed out but when his gaze fell on the digital clock on the microwave, he saw that he&rsquo;d been out for nearly nine hours.</p><p>It was silent in the apartment. Silent as the dead. His head slumped to the side and he looked at the entrance to the hallway. His father was back there. Or rather, his body. If he crawled just six feet to his left, he&rsquo;d be able to peer down the hall and see his dad&rsquo;s body slumped against the wall in the back bedroom. Immediately, Taehyung felt like he was going to be sick. He made his way clumsily to his feet and tripped into the kitchen, barely making it to the sink before he heaved and the contents of his stomach emptied into the basin. He spit a few times before sitting up again, a sheen of sweat coating his skin. When he brought his arm up to wipe his forehead, his eyes locked on the brown, dried blood that crusted on his skin. Then he looked down again at his white t-shirt. Well, it used to be white.</p><p>He rushed out of the kitchen, turning his head away as he passed the hall so he wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally catch a glimpse of what was at the other end, then slipped out the front door, locking it behind him. He zipped his jacket up to his chin, glad that at least the dark sweatshirt hid the stains, and pulled the hood up over his hair and his sleeves down over his hands. He kept his head down to conceal any blood spatters on his face as he made his way through the dark streets and to the gas station.</p><p>To his relief, there were no cars there, but then another thought occurred to him. What if Namjoon wasn&rsquo;t there either? What if he&rsquo;d been caught again by his boss? He had to be there. Taehyung didn&rsquo;t have anyone else to turn to.</p><p>He jogged up to the front door and peered in. The place was dark. It looked deserted. As the panic started to set in, he raised his fist and beat it against the glass. At last, he caught movement from within. And then Namjoon appeared in one of the aisles toward the back. He seemed to recognize who it was immediately and hurried over. A lollipop stick stuck out of his mouth and he switched it from one corner to the other in a nervous habit as he unlocked the door and opened it. Only then did he notice that Taehyung was covered in blood. Slowly, he lifted a hand and pulled the candy out of his mouth.</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s breath quivered as he met the older boy&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I did something really bad, hyung.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c22cc05dfed25979cd8bccaa2fb299e/tumblr_inline_plrim8qsxI1qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrox5bo8Z1qe89j5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>05. Whalien 52</b></h2><p><i>Finding the minuscule fissures in the surface and digging its fingers in until we began to splinter.</i></p><p><b>February.<br /></b></p><p>An annoying ringing shattered the silence within the dark gas station causing Kim Namjoon to stir. With a groan, he started to roll over on his mattress when his body hit something. He froze in his half-sleep before remembering he wasn&rsquo;t alone on his bed. An arm flew out and draped over his shoulder, hand hovering in front of his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae,&rdquo; he uttered and reached over to turn the alarm off on his phone.</p><p>Taehyung didn&rsquo;t stir.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae,&rdquo; Namjoon said again a little louder. This time the boy let out a sleepy groan which tapered off into a snore. With a sigh, Namjoon got up off the mattress, his joints cracking as he did so and he winced rubbing his stiff neck. &ldquo;Tae, you have to get up. You can&rsquo;t be here when Mr. Bang-nim shows up.&rdquo;</p><p>It was still dark outside but Namjoon had learned never to let himself sleep until sunrise again. The gas station he worked at was a weird one that actually closed at night unlike the majority of the other stations in town. He was the opening and closing shift Monday through Friday and his boss took the middle shift, but the man came early in the morning to drop off the day&rsquo;s till and Namjoon couldn&rsquo;t be caught sleeping there again. One more time and he&rsquo;d be fired and back on the street.<br /></p><p>*</p><p>He&rsquo;d been by himself for much of his life. His parents had left him with his grandmother one weekend saying they were going on a special vacation for their anniversary. Only, they never came back. Namjoon&rsquo;s grandmother was an old, frail woman. Much too frail to take on a child&mdash;he was barely five at the time&mdash;and he spent most of his childhood fending for himself. When he was twelve, she developed cancer and passed away within just a few weeks of receiving the news. As soon as she died, Namjoon ran. He was so afraid of being put into foster care, never having a real home, never having a real family. He&rsquo;d basically already been fending for himself for seven years before that.</p><p>There&rsquo;d never been any record of his parents abandoning him or him living with his grandmother so it wasn&rsquo;t hard for him to disappear without a trace. The boy was clever and intelligent for his age and he was able to make it into the city and fake his way into school. He didn&rsquo;t care much for the classes, but going to school meant getting breakfast and lunch for free. It was there that he met Hoseok. The two became friends quickly, both having an interest in music. Hoseok was a dancer and Namjoon loved writing songs and melodies. Hoseok was already close with Yoongi who at this point was just discovering his love for producing. Together, the three of them would spend hours after school at Hoseok&rsquo;s house&mdash;since Namjoon didn&rsquo;t have one and Yoongi&rsquo;s parents didn&rsquo;t approve of his newfound hobby&mdash;writing music together that Yoongi would then go home and produce on his computer. Nothing ever came of it but for Namjoon, this was a pivotal time in his life. He developed a friendship with a small group that grew bigger until there were seven of them, the others like the family he never had. Brothers he was so desperate for. And for this friendship, he&rsquo;d be eternally grateful.</p><p>Eventually, they all figured out his situation, though he tried to hide it as he didn&rsquo;t want to be a burden on any of them. They found ways to help him out though, whether it was Jimin inviting him over for dinner once a week or Yoongi asking him to stay the night&mdash;or several nights&mdash;to help him work on a new song. The boys helped him as much as he would let them.</p><p>Taehyung, though, helped him the most, probably without even realizing it. The first time Taehyung called asking if he could stay with him&mdash;at that time he had been working and sleeping at the gas station for a few months&mdash;Namjoon was hesitant to let him. He&rsquo;d needed a job so he could afford food and a cellphone and already felt guilty having to secretly sleep at the station but he had nowhere else to go, and he worked the opening and closing shift anyway, so what was even the point of leaving at night? But then when Taehyung showed up at the gas station with a broken nose and a bruise on his throat that resembled a handprint, Namjoon couldn&rsquo;t turn him away.</p><p>Sure, the other boys were amazing. Always willing to help him, always wanting to do whatever they could, but it made him feel reliant on them and the last thing he wanted was to not be able to take care of himself. But Taehyung wasn&rsquo;t like that. Taehyung made him feel needed for once.</p><p>*</p><p>When he&rsquo;d shown up in the middle of the night covered in blood a month before, Namjoon hadn&rsquo;t wasted any time pulling him into the bathroom and helping clean him up as much as he could. He used the small travel size shampoos and soaps the gas station carried and scrubbed at Taehyung&rsquo;s hair and skin until the water in the sink ran clear. He had him change into the only other set of clothes he had, taking the bloody ones, dousing them with bleach and lighter fluid and then bagging them up and tossing them into the dumpster in the alley.</p><p>Then together, the two of them went back to Taehyung&rsquo;s apartment. Namjoon and Taehyung&mdash;silent in his still shocked state&mdash;dragged the body of Taehyung&rsquo;s father into the bathroom and dumped him into the tub. After that, Namjoon put Taehyung to work in the kitchen, having him bag up all the liquor bottles and the mail on the floor while he took care of the back bedroom. He scrubbed at the carpet with bleach until there was no trace of blood left.</p><p>He&rsquo;d grabbed several bags of ice and two rolls of duct tape from the gas station and now he emptied the bags into the tub before taping the window shut. Then, he shut and locked the door and sealed the cracks. With his eyes and nose now burning with the smell of bleach, Namjoon finally made his way back into the living room, only to find Taehyung standing there in the middle of it completely still.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae?&rdquo;</p><p>At the sound of his name, the boy had looked up to meet Namjoon&rsquo;s eyes. Taehyung&rsquo;s face was shining with tears as they trailed down his cheeks but you&rsquo;d never know he was crying by his stone-like expression.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even feel bad for doing it, hyung,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d uttered and when Namjoon looked down at his hands, they were clenched into trembling fists. &ldquo;I was just so angry. I couldn&rsquo;t stop. What&rsquo;s wrong with me, hyung? Why don&rsquo;t I feel guilty for killing my father?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon had dropped the bag full of bloody paper towels and bleach right there next to the hallway and rushed over to Taehyung just in time to catch him before he could collapse to the floor. The boy sobbed into his chest, clinging so tightly to him that his fingers bruised his skin. Namjoon held him for a long time there in the middle of the living room, not saying a word and not loosening his tight grip on him. Finally, Taehyung&rsquo;s sobs quieted to sporadic sniffles and then he let go of Namjoon, sitting back on his butt and dragging his hands down his face to wipe his tears away.</p><p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Taehyung had asked, his voice raspy and low.</p><p>Namjoon looked around at the several trash bags filled with evidence of their being there. His attempt to conceal the body wasn&rsquo;t going to hold up forever. Eventually, it was going to start to smell and someone was going to discover it. Not to mention the man had a job. His absence wouldn&rsquo;t go unnoticed for long.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to get you far away from here,&rdquo; Namjoon finally said and Taehyung&rsquo;s eyes widened in fear.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t send me away, hyung,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this on my own.&rdquo;</p><p>With a sigh, Namjoon got to his feet and held a hand out to him. &ldquo;Then we need to figure out a way for you to hide.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Taehyung had been staying with him ever since then. Every morning before the sun came up, he would leave and every night after closing, he&rsquo;d return. Namjoon wasn&rsquo;t sure what he did during the day and would spend the whole time worrying the boy wasn&rsquo;t going to show up in the evening, but so far, he always did.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae, come on, man,&rdquo; Namjoon said again, giving the boy a hard push and sending him rolling off the other side of the mattress with a groan of protest. &ldquo;Unless you want to hide in a broom closet all day, you have to get out of here.&rdquo; Taehyung finally stirred, getting slowly to his feet.</p><p>He rubbed at his eyes, staggered and caught himself on a rack of magazines before he could topple over. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me leave today, hyung,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold out there and I don&rsquo;t have anything to do. Just let me stay here today, please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to get caught?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung slowly peeled one eye open to look up at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay hidden. I promise. You won&rsquo;t even know I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>Just then, headlights flashed across their faces and Namjoon&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Get in the bathroom,&rdquo; he said quickly before shoving him into the tiny space. Then he picked up the air mattress and threw it in after him. Luckily, the thing was light. After looking around to make sure there was no evidence of him being there, Namjoon ran into the backroom, unlocking the door that lead to the alley and slipping outside.He stood there behind the store for several minutes, waiting for his heart to stop hammering and the sweat that had broken out on his skin to dry. It was cold outside. A cold so sharp it stung his lungs with each breath and made his head hurt.</p><p>At last, he stuffed his numb hands into his pockets and, as nonchalantly as possible, walked around to the front of the store to meet his boss.</p><p>Mr. Bang was just getting out of his SUV when Namjoon came around the corner. The sky had lightened to a pale gray already.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, Namjoon,&rdquo; the man said with a friendly smile and made his way toward the locked front doors.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, sir,&rdquo; Namjoon replied. He watched with coiled nerves as his boss withdrew a key and unlocked the store. Then when he followed him inside, Namjoon&rsquo;s eyes shifted to the bathroom door.</p><p>&ldquo;There are a few boxes in the back that need unpacked if you want to do that while I open the register,&rdquo; Mr. Bang said as he slipped behind the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Already done, sir,&rdquo; Namjoon replied shifting nervously from one foot to the other.</p><p>A sharp knock came from the direction of the bathroom just then causing Namjoon to jump. Immediately, he felt his face go pale. Maybe Mr. Bang hadn&rsquo;t heard. But when he looked back at his boss and saw that the man was looking curiously now at the bathroom, a sense of dread overcame him.</p><p>&ldquo;We better not have a rat problem again,&rdquo; the man uttered to himself as he, to Namjoon&rsquo;s horror, got out from behind the counter again and made his way toward the bathroom at the back of the store.</p><p>Namjoon watched as everything seemed to move in slow motion. His eyes could only focus on the man&rsquo;s hand as he reached for the doorknob, and silently begin to pray that by some miracle, Taehyung would somehow be able to squeeze his long, lanky body into a dark corner and disappear.</p><p>No such luck. The door creaked open, revealing an unsuspecting Taehyung, blanket wrapped around him as he sat on the cold tile floor.</p><p>Namjoon let out a groan and squeezed his eyes shut. Maybe his boss would keep it a secret. Maybe he&rsquo;d understand the situation and let them stay. No, he knew better than that.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Taehyung said quietly, his mouth lifting into a guilty smile.</p><p>Namjoon&rsquo;s eyes drilled into the back of his boss&rsquo;s head as he waited with bated breath for the man to speak. The silence was thick, making it hard for Namjoon to pull air into his lungs. Then at last, the owner of the gas station turned to look at him. The expression on his face was unreadable at first. Completely blank like a mannequin&rsquo;s. Surely, the man recognized Taehyung from the news. The boy&rsquo;s picture and his father&rsquo;s had been on every network since the discovery of the man&rsquo;s body in their apartment. The police had already questioned the other boys, none of them giving any sort of answer more than a shrug and an &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him,&rdquo; and Namjoon hadn&rsquo;t even been questioned since there wasn&rsquo;t any record of him existing in the city anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon, come outside with me,&rdquo; Mr. Bang finally said, his voice steady, his face still unreadable.</p><p>With a quick glance back at Taehyung, Namjoon followed after him through the back room and out the exit into the alley.</p><p>Mr. Bang finally turned to face him, raking his hands down his face with a heavy sigh. &ldquo;Namjoon, I&rsquo;ve turned a blind eye a lot over the three years you&rsquo;ve worked for me. I paid you under the table. Didn&rsquo;t say anything when stock didn&rsquo;t match with my inventory list. &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t say anything when I found out you were sleeping here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you knew&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Mr. Bang interrupted. &ldquo;And I hoped it was only temporary. But Namjoon, you&rsquo;re harboring a fugitive. I can&rsquo;t have that in my store. I could lose the business. I could go to jail. I&rsquo;m sorry but the two of you are going to have to go somewhere else.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon squeezed his eyes shut. He just had to think for a moment. There had to be some way for him to be able to keep his job. He wet his lips. &ldquo;Mr. Bang&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t call the police. But you can&rsquo;t work here anymore. I&rsquo;m sorry, Namjoon. I really am.&rdquo;</p><p>With a sigh, the boy opened his eyes again, finally meeting his boss&rsquo;s&mdash;well, former boss&rsquo;s. The man had been like a father to him for the past three years. A good boss. Which had made Namjoon work hard to be a good employee. He&rsquo;d only taken items when he was really desperate. Though, lately he&rsquo;d been a lot more careless. Taking candy and food and alcohol. Even if he wasn&rsquo;t hiding Taehyung, he deserved to be fired. Finally, Namjoon took another deep breath. &ldquo;I understand, sir,&rdquo; he said and extended his hand. &ldquo;Thank you for everything.&rdquo;</p><p>The man&rsquo;s mouth lifted into a sad smile as he reached out and shook Namjoon&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything I can do for you. If you need money, or a lawyer&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No thank you, sir,&rdquo; Namjoon cut him off. &ldquo;I can take care of this on my own.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Bang gave him a sharp nod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a few minutes to collect your things.&rdquo; Then he turned and went back into his store.</p><p>Namjoon stood there in the alley for several more minutes, eyes on the ground as he kicked at the gravel with his shoe. What was he going to do now? He was homeless again. Homeless and harboring a fugitive. Taehyung wouldn&rsquo;t last long on the streets. Namjoon had been taking care of himself for a long time. He knew what parts of town to avoid. He knew how to evade. Where to go if he needed temporary shelter. How to survive on as little food as possible. But Taehyung&hellip;he was only a boy. While his life hadn&rsquo;t been a luxurious one, or even an okay one, at least he&rsquo;d had a roof over his head. Clothes on his back. Food in his stomach. He needed that again.</p><p>Finally, Namjoon went back inside. Taehyung was leaning against the bathroom doorframe, his hands stuffed deep into his pockets, his bottom lip between his teeth. He straightened up when he saw his hyung come from the back room.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to go,&rdquo; Namjoon said walking past him to the broom closet.</p><p>Taehyung followed after him. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon opened the closet and grabbed his worn, black backpack then started stuffing his few belongings into it. Beanie, face mask, phone charger, copy of Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, a journal and a pen.</p><p>&ldquo;Hyung.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figure something out,&rdquo; Namjoon replied and pulled the confused boy after him.</p><p>Mr. Bang stood by the door, a shopping bag in one hand and an envelope in the other. He held them out to Namjoon as they approached. &ldquo;Take these.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon looked down at the bag. He could see several cups of ramen, water bottles and a few other things through the opaque plastic.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your help, sir,&rdquo; he said and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Taehyung look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hyung, I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my responsibility,&rdquo; Namjoon interrupted. &ldquo;I can take care of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At least take your last paycheck.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon glanced down at the thick envelope then up at his former boss as he took it from him. When he opened the envelope, his eyes widened. &ldquo;Sir, I can&rsquo;t accept this. It&rsquo;s so much more than my normal pay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just consider it severance.&rdquo;</p><p>With a nod, Namjoon stuffed the envelope into the pocket of his coat and looked again at the man. &ldquo;Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work for you, sir. And for letting me stay here for as long as you did.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Bang gave him a tight-lipped nod before stepping out of the way so he could pull Taehyung out the door.</p><p>&ldquo;What do we do now, hyung?&rdquo; Taehyung asked as the two made their way back into the alley behind the gas station.</p><p>&ldquo;For now, we find somewhere to hide until it&rsquo;s dark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon yanked him down between two dumpsters just as a car pulled into the alley a block down. The two sat there in tense silence until it passed by them. Then Namjoon peaked his head out, not letting Taehyung get back up until the car had turned out of the alley and onto the street.</p><p>&ldquo;Hyung?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at the boy who looked back with saddened eyes. He seemed so much younger, so much smaller all of a sudden. He was only a couple years Namjoon&rsquo;s junior but the uneasy expression on his face made him look like a scared child. Namjoon opened his backpack and pulled out his beanie and face mask.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Tae,&rdquo; Namjoon said handing the things to him. After Taehyung put them on, Namjoon pulled him against him and they made their way farther down the alley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figure something out.&rdquo;</p><p>Throughout the day, Namjoon racked his brain, trying to come up with a solution to this rather large problem of theirs. He couldn&rsquo;t ask any of the guys. Yoongi could lose his home if he was caught with Taehyung, and the others lived with their families. But maybe Jin&hellip;</p><p>*</p><p>The oldest boy in the group was home for an extended weekend and was the one to answer the door when Namjoon knocked. He&rsquo;d had Taehyung hide in the shadows created by the neatly trimmed hedge along the side of the house just in case one of Jin&rsquo;s parents answered instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Joon?&rdquo; Jin said stepping out onto the porch. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a few weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been busy,&rdquo; Namjoon replied and looked down at his feet. He hated being here. He hated what he was about to do. Hated asking for help. Because it just made him feel like he wasn&rsquo;t capable. Like he was worthless.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here so late?&rdquo; Jin asked, pulling him out of his dark thoughts. &ldquo;Is something going on? Are the others alright?&rdquo; Suddenly his eyes widened in horror. &ldquo;Is it Taehyung?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon bit his lip and gave a pathetic chuckle. &ldquo;Yeah, I guess you could say that,&rdquo; he said then heard a rustle behind him as Taehyung stepped into the light.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Jin-hyung.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin&rsquo;s eyes darted to the side to meet the younger boy&rsquo;s over Namjoon&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Tae?&rdquo; Then he looked at Namjoon again. &ldquo;Has he been with you this whole time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. He&rsquo;s been staying with me at the gas station.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the two of you haven&rsquo;t been caught?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were today,&rdquo; Taehyung answered, his words muffled by the face mask he was still wearing, and stuffed his hands into the pockets of the coat Namjoon had given him a month ago.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys can&rsquo;t be here,&rdquo; Jin said and took a step back so he was back on the other side of the threshold. &ldquo;I already had to lie to the police and to my parents&hellip;and if anyone sees us talking&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon let out a heavy sigh and looked up at Jin. &ldquo;Tae has nowhere to go, hyung. He needs you right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he cracked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Joon, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Anger flooded Namjoon&rsquo;s gut as he bit the inside of his cheek. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be his friend,&rdquo; Namjoon uttered so Taehyung couldn&rsquo;t hear. &ldquo;Any of the other guys wouldn&rsquo;t even hesitate to help. You know I wouldn&rsquo;t normally ask for a favor but I&rsquo;m desperate. Please don&rsquo;t make me beg.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin lifted his eyes to the ceiling, blinking hard and letting his head fall back. &ldquo;Joon, I don&rsquo;t think you understand what you&rsquo;re asking of me, here.&rdquo; Then he looked at him again. &ldquo;Where would I hide him? How would I keep this from my parents?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our brother, hyung&rdquo; Namjoon growled. &ldquo;You would <i>figure</i> it out because that&rsquo;s what family <i>does</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin stepped back further, hand reaching up to grip the doorknob. He looked like he was ready to turn and run. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, guys,&rdquo; he said again shaking his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much to ask. I&rsquo;m sorry. Really. I wish there was something I could do.&rdquo;</p><p><i>There is something you can do</i>, Namjoon thought as he ground his teeth together. But he just stared back at the boy. He could see the despair written across Jin&rsquo;s face. Maybe he really was trapped. Maybe he really couldn&rsquo;t help no matter how much he wanted to. At last, Namjoon&rsquo;s face smoothed then with a heavy sigh, he turned around. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Tae.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung gave a curt nod then looked back up at Jin where he stood in his doorway. &ldquo;Bye, Jin-hyung.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Tae,&rdquo; he cracked.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon didn&rsquo;t turn around again to say goodbye. His chest felt so tight, he didn&rsquo;t even know if he could speak. So instead, he kept walking down the path, Taehyung&rsquo;s footsteps echoing behind him. Then he heard the faint sound of the door closing and the tightness dissipated, leaving him feeling emptier than he ever had before.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do we go now, hyung?&rdquo; Taehyung asked from behind him.</p><p>It was so cold now and Namjoon had no idea what to tell the younger boy. They couldn&rsquo;t stay out in the open like this. Someone would eventually recognize Taehyung. No, he needed to get out of the city. Far away. He needed to disappear.</p><p>Namjoon lifted his head, looked farther down the street, his eyes settling on the empty bus stop. Immediately he felt a lump forming in his stomach. He knew what he had to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said taking Taehyung&rsquo;s arm in his hand and pulling him down the sidewalk. When they reached the bus stop, he had the younger boy sit on the bench as he studied the schedule attached to a pole. A bus would be arriving any minute. Just their luck.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we going somewhere?&rdquo; Taehyung asked.</p><p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then he sucked in a sharp breath and turned to face the boy. &ldquo;But you are.&rdquo; Then Namjoon tugged his beanie down further over Taehyung&rsquo;s ears and lifted the mask around his neck up to cover the lower half of his face. In the bulky sweater and coat he wore, his lanky, teenage body was well hidden making it hard to tell how old he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait until you&rsquo;re at least a few towns over before you get off,&rdquo; Namjoon said, trying his hardest not to meet the scared boy&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Then you need to find some sort of shelter. If you can stay there, do it. If not, try to stay in populated parts of town. You&rsquo;ll be safer that way. Understood?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared, hyung,&rdquo; Taehyung said, his eyes turned down in the corners and silently pleading with Namjoon not to make him go.</p><p>Namjoon felt his heart shatter in his chest. He&rsquo;d told Taehyung he&rsquo;d keep him safe and he&rsquo;d failed. With a sharp intake of breath to clear the fog from his eyes, he shoved his hand into the pocket of his coat and withdrew the envelope of money he&rsquo;d received from Mr. Bang.</p><p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; he said to Taehyung and pressed it into his hand, not even giving him a chance to reach out and take it himself.</p><p>&ldquo;But, hyung, this is all your money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Namjoon said with a shake of his head. &ldquo;You need it more than I do. Please, just take it and find some place safe to hide.&rdquo; At last he met the boy&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Just find somewhere to stay put and once everything calms down, I&rsquo;ll come and find you. We&rsquo;ll figure something out together, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung nodded and then the two turned when the bus came around the corner. Suddenly, Namjoon felt unease like a chunk of ice settle in his gut. Maybe this was a mistake. His thoughts were interrupted though when Taehyung threw his arms around the older boy and clutched onto him for dear life.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do without you, hyung.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon pulled his bottom lip into his mouth and bit down hard to keep the tears from spilling over. In a moment of weakness, he buried his head into the younger boy&rsquo;s neck, and inhaled deeply. In all honesty, he didn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;d do without Taehyung either.</p><p>Namjoon was the one to finally pull away. With a hard sniff, he stepped back, letting one hand linger on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder for just a moment longer, giving it a fond squeeze before dropping his arm entirely. The bus had already been sitting for a little while behind them, the driver waiting for the two to finish saying their goodbyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Call me any time day or night if you need anything,&rdquo; Namjoon said. &ldquo;Even if you don&rsquo;t need anything, just call sometimes so I know you&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung nodded quickly, his breath trembling in the cold. Or maybe it was something else. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you soon,&rdquo; he said, his voice low and quivering just a bit.</p><p>Namjoon nodded back then motioned with his chin toward the bus. He watched Taehyung step on, stopping at the top of the stairs to pay for his fare before heading back to find a seat.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d ever see Taehyung again. And as the bus pulled away, he hoped and prayed to whatever was out there that he would, but something told him this was a permanent goodbye.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4df17cf204417156d0ae1b5d07da07a8/tumblr_inline_plriogg9ll1qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plroyyll771qe89j5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>06. House of Cards</b></h2><p><i>It wasn&rsquo;t long before we&rsquo;d break apart, shatter like a glass vase on the tile floor.</i><br /></p><p><b>March.</b><br /></p><p>Min Yoongi let out a heavy sigh, leaning way back in his computer chair until his spine gave a satisfying crack. He&rsquo;d been sitting hunched forward at his desk for hours now and this song he&rsquo;d been working on for the past two weeks was just starting to finally take shape. His stomach growled and he glanced up at the corner of his monitor to see that three hours had passed since the last time he checked. Which meant he hadn&rsquo;t eaten anything in almost six.</p><p><i>Just a little bit longer,</i> he thought and rolled his shoulders before leaning back in.</p><p>The sound of a groan and the crunch of couch springs came from the room next to him and Yoongi pushed back in his chair again to peer through the doorway.</p><p>&ldquo;Kook-ah,&rdquo; he cracked, his voice raspy from not being used in so long. &ldquo;Are you getting up?&rdquo;</p><p>The maknae groaned again but sat up, his eyes still shut and his bottom lip jutting forward in a sleepy pout.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to get going soon so you aren&rsquo;t late for school.&rdquo;</p><p>Another groan. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Friday. Can&rsquo;t I just skip?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung&rsquo;s been gone for almost a month now. You want Jimin to be alone?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook was silent for a few seconds as he mulled over Yoongi&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;No, I guess not,&rdquo; he said then with a huff, got to his feet.</p><p>A satisfied smile tugged at the corner of Yoongi&rsquo;s mouth as he sat up and rolled back over to his desk, the wheels of his chair catching and scraping against the plywood floor.</p><p>His place was nothing special. Sheet rocked walls, plywood floors and no windows. He wouldn&rsquo;t even call it a house. He&rsquo;d barely call it livable. But it was home.</p><p>Each of the guys&mdash;besides Jin&mdash;had lived there at one time or another with him and Jungkook basically lived there all the time. Yoongi didn&rsquo;t mind. He&rsquo;d grown very fond of the boy. In fact, he saw a lot of himself in him. The kid was driven. He had so much potential. But life had dealt him a cruel hand. Luckily for him, Yoongi had been through something similar.</p><p>*</p><p>His parents had been the type to have his life mapped out for him from birth. They knew where he was to go to school, what college, what classes, what major, what profession he was supposed to end up with. He was their golden child and he tried to live up to their impossibly high standards for as long as he could. But music never factored in for them and when he discovered his love for it in middle school, his priorities changed. No longer did he have time for all of his AP classes or clubs or sports. It was music, music, music.</p><p>At sixteen, he dropped out and his parents&mdash;disgusted at their disgrace of a son&mdash;wanted nothing to do with him. Quickly, their golden child became less valuable than tarnished brass and they dumped him out on the street.</p><p>That was almost four years ago. The boy still spent most nights working on songs, writing, producing, marketing to try and get his foot in the door of the music industry but nothing had really happened. He wasn&rsquo;t one to give up though.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Hyung, have you slept at all?&rdquo; Jungkook asked peaking his head into the doorway of Yoongi&rsquo;s studio.</p><p>Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes stayed glued to his monitor. &ldquo;I slept yesterday,&rdquo; he uttered suddenly feeling a rush of fatigue. He blinked hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you at least eaten recently?&rdquo; Jungkook took the older boy&rsquo;s silence as a no and leaned in to place a bowl with an apple and a boiled egg on the edge of his desk. &ldquo;Try to get some rest today, hyung.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi grunted in reply, missing the fond smile that curled the corners of Jungkook&rsquo;s mouth upward. A few seconds later, he heard the front door open. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget your homework!&rdquo; he called out.</p><p>Jungkook let out an exasperated cry before Yoongi heard frantic rustling, then a &ldquo;bye, hyung!&rdquo; and finally, the heavy door of the train car dragging across the ground and slamming shut with a metal <i>clang</i>. Once the echo faded, Yoongi cracked his neck and then leaned in again to his computer. This project wasn&rsquo;t like any he&rsquo;d worked on in the past. This one could possibly be the most important of his life.</p><p>He&rsquo;d seen a job posting for a producing gig in Seoul; a position at a very well known label. One that had put out nothing but incredible music since it started. At first Yoongi had been hesitant to apply but then decided to give it a shot. What was the worse that could happen? They reject him?</p><p>Actually, yes. Rejection was the literal worst thing that could happen to Yoongi. Burn his house down. Steal all his money. Run him over with your car. But please. Please don&rsquo;t tell him that the thing he&rsquo;s worked so hard on, the thing that he&rsquo;s so passionate about, the thing that made his parents actually kick him out of his house, isn&rsquo;t good enough. Nothing scared him more than that.</p><p>Yoongi pushed back from his desk again. The symbolic weight of this project had taken its toll on him over the past few weeks, causing tight knots to form in his shoulders and migraines to drill into the space between his eyes until pain killers and alcohol couldn&rsquo;t even dull the ache. Maybe he really did need to get some rest. Ah, but he was so close. He could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just a few more hours. Another day maybe. Just a little bit longer and it would be finished. And then the painstakingly long wait for their reply.</p><p>With an anxiety filled sigh, he grabbed the apple from Jungkook out of the bowl and took a bite.</p><p>*</p><p>Just as he thought, the song took him another two days to complete. Two more sleep and food deprived, caffeine fueled days. By the time he submitted his song, he felt ready to sleep for the next three months. Instead, that night while he was tossing and turning in bed, his phone screen lit up with an email. He reached over for it, squinting at the bright screen in the darkness. His heavy eyes popped open when he saw the name of the sender and he sat bolt upright. His heart pounded as he clicked on the email. His hands shook and he dropped his phone, scrambling to pick it up so he could finally find out if his effort had been for nothing. Then he opened the email with bated breath and his eyes roved over the first line of the email.</p><p><i>Mr. Min,</i></p><p><i>We were impressed with your song and&hellip;</i></p><p>Yoongi read the whole email several times before letting the meaning of the words completely sink in. He&rsquo;d made it. He&rsquo;d made it? Yoongi got to his feet in one fluid motion.</p><p>&ldquo;I made it?&rdquo;</p><p>Immediately, he wanted to run into the living room where Jungkook was sleeping soundly and jump up and down on him, screaming until the maknae was celebrating with him. He wanted to call the others. He wanted to share the good news. But&hellip;</p><p>What about Jungkook? What would the kid do if Yoongi up and moved to the big city? Of course he&rsquo;d want to come with him. To drop out of school, leave his foster family, leave the rest of the guys behind to follow him. No, Yoongi couldn&rsquo;t let him do that. His whole life was here. He needed to graduate. He needed to go to college. Make something of himself. Get out of this perpetual life of suck he was currently in. But could Yoongi leave him behind? Sure, Jungkook needed him, needed his couch, needed the security of having somewhere and someone that actually cared about him as a person instead of as a means to a paycheck from the government. But Yoongi kind of needed him too. It was nice having someone that cared about his well-being when that was usually the furthest thing from his own mind. Jungkook was always asking him if he&rsquo;d slept, if he&rsquo;d eaten, if he&rsquo;d showered, recently.</p><p>Jungkook was the one to keep him connected to the rest of the guys most of the time. He would have become a hermit by now if the kid wasn&rsquo;t constantly inviting them over to hang out. It wasn&rsquo;t that Yoongi didn&rsquo;t like having them over. It wasn&rsquo;t like he didn&rsquo;t value their friendship. He could just so easily get so wrapped up in a project that he&rsquo;d be glued to his computer for weeks. Jungkook kept him grounded. Kept him in this world instead of in his head all the time.</p><p>But this was Yoongi&rsquo;s dream. This was the validation he&rsquo;d been denied by his parents. The validation he needed. But the question was, what did he need more?</p><p>*</p><p>Yoongi slumped on the farthest cushion on the couch from Jungkook, empty glass in his hand. He&rsquo;d been sitting there for a while, rolling the last bit of his bitter drink around in the bottom of the glass and trying to figure out how he could possibly break the news to Jungkook that he&rsquo;d be leaving for Seoul the next day.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t told anyone about the job offer, or rather the prospective job offer. There hadn&rsquo;t actually been a contract signed but Yoongi had a very good feeling that there&rsquo;d be one waiting for him once he got there. He&rsquo;d been in contact with the label since that first fateful email a week before. They&rsquo;d sent him several files to tweak and send back. Just more tests of his producing capabilities. They seemed impressed.</p><p>*</p><p>This party was in celebration of Taehyung coming back to them&mdash;not that they ever needed a reason to get together. He&rsquo;d ended up getting picked up by the police a week before a few cities over and when he tried calling Namjoon, he got an automated message saying the boy&rsquo;s service had been disconnected. Much to Namjoon&rsquo;s dismay and the other guys insistence, he&rsquo;d had been couch surfing for the past month while he looked for a job. Since he hadn&rsquo;t been able to find one, he couldn&rsquo;t pay his bill and his phone was disconnected.</p><p>Luckily, Taehyung&rsquo;s next phone call had been to Jin, who had managed to persuade his lawyer father to bail the boy out and represent him in his upcoming trial. Of course, Jin had to threaten to drop out of college to get his parents to comply but they finally did much to his relief. He&rsquo;d felt sick with guilt for weeks after having to turn Namjoon and Taehyung away that night they showed up at his door. He&rsquo;d wanted nothing more than to invite them both in and promise the younger boys that everything was going to be okay. But what could have happened if they were caught under his roof? What would have become of his father&rsquo;s reputation? Of his schooling? &nbsp;Even now with Taehyung in his care and out of jail, he couldn&rsquo;t get rid of the guilt that still hung over his head. And now he stood in Yoongi&rsquo;s kitchen, slumped against the counter, nursing his own drink.</p><p>Namjoon was having his own pity party in a different corner. The boy had confided in Yoongi a lot over the past month. Yoongi had never seen him so worked up and simultaneously so low before. His self-appointed purpose in life for so long had been as the support for his friends. As a guardian for Taehyung. And now he&rsquo;d failed him. Namjoon had become even more of a wreck after waking up to find his phone had been disconnected and that Taehyung had tried calling him from jail.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t there when he needed me the most, hyung,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said to Yoongi one night, tears slipping down his cheeks. &ldquo;What kind of friend am I?&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Even with this being a party, no one seemed to be in a celebratory mood. While the three oldest brooded in their respective places, and Hoseok tried not to pass out from exhaustion on an arm chair, the three youngest clung to each other on the other side of the couch. The last couple of months had been traumatizing for Taehyung. From killing his father, to wandering around a strange city, to getting arrested and having to spend several nights in a jail cell not knowing his fate, it had all been too much.</p><p>When Jin and Jin&rsquo;s father had gone to pick him up from the police station, he&rsquo;d looked like a completely different person. His skin was pale and pulled taut over his bones, more prominent since he hadn&rsquo;t eaten much while on the run. He hadn&rsquo;t said a word to Jin and only uttered a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to Mr. Kim. His face had been completely blank and he could barely make eye contact with his oldest friend. The boy had seemed like nothing more than a shell of his former self. He warmed up a bit over the following weeks, opening up just barely, talking a little more, filling back out, and much to the others&rsquo; relief, color began to return to his skin again. But that haunting look in his eyes was still there. Who knew if it would ever go away?</p><p>With one of his supports no longer by his side at school all day, Jimin had started to notice the menacing looks again from Jiho and his friends. After being ambushed a couple months back, his anxiety had been through the roof, his nerves on edge all day every day. It was exhausting. Especially keeping up a positive front for Jungkook. The poor kid was trying so hard to be there for Jimin but the original idea had been for either he <i>or</i> Taehyung to be in all of Jimin&rsquo;s classes which left the boy vulnerable at times. Jiho was smart. He&rsquo;d never touch Jimin in school but he could intimidate him which was almost worse. It made Jimin flinch at every little thing. Made him hesitate before turning corners. Made him shrink into Jungkook causing them to stumble over each other, get tangled up. Jungkook couldn&rsquo;t miss a single day, couldn&rsquo;t rest for a single moment if it meant Jimin being without his protection.</p><p>The three of them looked exhausted. Looked defeated there slumped on the couch with controllers in their hands as they played some mindless video game on Yoongi&rsquo;s little tv. Yoongi could see just how affected they&rsquo;d each become by everything over the past couple of months. The bags under their eyes. The way they leaned into each other as if making sure they were really there. The way Jimin&rsquo;s leg constantly touched Taehyung&rsquo;s as if to say, &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s okay. Don&rsquo;t worry about me,&rdquo; </i>while his other shoulder touched Jungkook&rsquo;s as if to say, &ldquo;<i>please don&rsquo;t leave me.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>That was it. Yoongi had to break the news to Jungkook. He couldn&rsquo;t let him come with him. Jimin needed Jungkook. Hoseok needed Jimin. Taehyung needed Jin. Namjoon needed Taehyung. The group needed to stay together. At least the rest of them. They&rsquo;d be fine without Yoongi. They&rsquo;d find another place to hang out. Everything would be fine. But how to break the news to the youngest maknae? Yoongi looked down at his empty glass. Maybe a bit more liquid courage would help. He felt too conflicted right now. Too guilty still.</p><p>With a groan, he got up off the couch and he made his way to the kitchen. He was already feeling pretty out of it&mdash;the fact that he hadn&rsquo;t slept well for over a week was definitely part of it. Seeing Jin there blocking the alcohol made anger flare up in the pit of his stomach. Sure the boy had eventually helped Taehyung by bailing him out of jail but the kid wouldn&rsquo;t have been there in the first place if Jin hadn&rsquo;t turned him away.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing in front of the booze,&rdquo; Yoongi uttered. The only reason Jin was there was because he&rsquo;d brought Taehyung, and because&mdash;despite the fact that Yoongi kind of hated him right now&mdash;he was still part of the group.</p><p>Jin didn&rsquo;t say anything, instead just stepped to the side so Yoongi could grab the half empty bottle of whiskey. He didn&rsquo;t even bother pouring more into his cup, just brought the mouth of the bottle to his lips and tossed his head back. The alcohol burned its way down his throat, liquid fire pooling in his belly until he finally had to stop so he could take a breath. Then he lowered his head again, his unfocused eyes landing on Jin.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what my problem is with you?&rdquo; he asked as he jabbed a finger into the older boy&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Completely taken off guard, Jin tried to step back but was already flush against the counter and cupboards. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that crap, <i>hyung</i>,&rdquo; Yoongi snarled. The energy of the whole room suddenly shifted as the others stopped what they were doing to watch. &ldquo;Namjoon told me everything,&rdquo; Yoongi continued. &ldquo;You think you can just abandon your brother when he needs you the most and then just swoop in like some hero and save the day?&rdquo; Jin&rsquo;s eyes darted to the others in the room and he swallowed hard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real piece of work, you know that?&rdquo; Yoongi asked, leaning in close. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really just over here flaunting your silver spoon over all of our heads. Making everyone else feel like absolute crap while you&rsquo;re off getting some <i>fancy</i> degree. Living in your <i>fancy</i> dorms. Coming home to your <i>fancy</i> house. You know, some of us actually have to work hard to get where we want to go? Most of us have to work hard just to get by. And even then, we still fail.&rdquo; Yoongi let out a pathetic chuckle and wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his jacket. &ldquo;Everything just comes so easy for you, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you even still hang out with us? Why would you want to be around losers like us all the time? Huh? Do you like just holding what we&rsquo;ll never have over our heads? Is that it? Does it make you feel better seeing how crappy our lives are, <i>Seokjin</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>A hand clamped down on Yoongi&rsquo;s shoulder and pulled him away from Jin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, hyung,&rdquo; Jungkook said in his ear.</p><p>Yoongi spun around to face him. Over the years they&rsquo;d known each other, Yoongi had watched Jungkook surpass him in height and stature. He was taller, broader, stronger. The boy was a fighter. A survivor. He&rsquo;d make it just fine without Yoongi.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone, get out,&rdquo; Yoongi said at last and took another swig from the bottle in his hand.</p><p>No one moved or said anything, none of them really sure what to do.</p><p>&ldquo;I said out!&rdquo; Yoongi&rsquo;s voice cracked on the last word as he raised his voice. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p><p>The others leapt into action then. Jin slipped out from behind Yoongi and pulled his truck keys from his pocket as he made his way toward the door. At the sight of their ride leaving, Taehyung and Jimin dropped their controllers on the coffee table and hurried after him, uttering quick goodbyes to Jungkook as they passed him. Hoseok and Namjoon left silently as well, Namjoon&rsquo;s gaze holding Yoongi&rsquo;s as he made his way past him. Hoseok was too tired to even care about the outburst. He hadn&rsquo;t really wanted to be there anyway and now he was just looking forward to going home and sleeping. The two left, pulling the heavy metal door shut behind them and at last it was just Yoongi and Jungkook left in the silence.</p><p>Yoongi let out a heavy sigh as he placed the whiskey bottle back on the counter then pushed the heels of his hands against his eyes. His head was pounding and his throat burned and he just wanted to collapse into his bed. This whole night had been a complete wreck. He wanted nothing more than to just be alone so he could try and figure everything out. But when he opened his eyes again, he saw Jungkook still standing there with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Yoongi sighed again.</p><p>&ldquo;Go home, Kook,&rdquo; he said finally, raking his fingers back through his hair.</p><p>Jungkook furrowed his brows. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>The anguish that had been haunting him every night for the past week reawakened in Yoongi&rsquo;s gut and he clenched his fists down at his sides to keep his composure from cracking. &ldquo;I said, go home,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your parent. I can&rsquo;t take care of you. You have a family. You have a home. Go there.&rdquo;</p><p>He wanted so badly to take Jungkook with him to Seoul. He wanted to protect the boy from the world. He wanted to be his home. To be his family. To be there. But he knew he couldn&rsquo;t and he could feel himself already starting to break apart. <i>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best for him. You can&rsquo;t protect him. You have to let him go.</i></p><p>He wanted nothing more in this life than to not be the cause of the hurt expression on Jungkook&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But hyung&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just get out!&rdquo; Yoongi screamed and squeezed his eyes shut. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you anymore!&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook&rsquo;s breath hitched and suddenly he was silent. Yoongi didn&rsquo;t want to look at him. Didn&rsquo;t want to meet his eyes. But finally he did. And what he saw shattered him completely. The boy&rsquo;s eyes were glassy, his bottom lip pulled into his mouth. He wore the same dejected expression as the first time he&rsquo;d run away from home and ended up at Yoongi&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;d told him that he&rsquo;d gotten in a fight with his foster dad. That the man had called him worthless, nothing more than a means to a paycheck. That the minute he turned eighteen, he was out of there. Yoongi had pulled him in. Let him cry against him. Squeezed him tight and told him he&rsquo;d never feel unwanted again&hellip;</p><p>Finally, Jungkook spoke. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi let out a stuttering breath. &ldquo;You heard me.&rdquo; <i>Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. He&rsquo;ll be alright. He can make it on his own. </i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to give up a lot for you. I&rsquo;ve had to put my dreams on hold. My future on hold so you&rsquo;d have a place to stay and someone to take care of you. You&rsquo;ve been holding me back long enough. You&rsquo;re not a kid anymore. You need to start taking care of yourself. I&rsquo;ve done my job. Now you need to start doing yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook swallowed hard, eyes drilling so intensely into Yoongi&rsquo;s that at last the older boy had to look up at the ceiling. <i>Please, just leave. Please, just go and don&rsquo;t say anything.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just drunk, hyung,&rdquo; Jungkook finally said and stepped forward to place his hands on Yoongi&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just stressed out and you need to sleep it off.&rdquo; Then he started guiding Yoongi to his bedroom.</p><p>But Yoongi pushed him away. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>just need sleep</i>,&rdquo; he growled and turned to face the younger boy again. &ldquo;I said what I said and I meant it.&rdquo; Then he shoved Jungkook hard, causing him to stumble back toward the door. &ldquo;Go home, Jungkook.&rdquo; He shoved him again. &ldquo;Go home and don&rsquo;t come back here.&rdquo; Again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t belong here, anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop shoving me, hyung,&rdquo; Jungkook snapped and straightened up to his full height. The kid was massive compared to Yoongi and infinitely more intimidating. Yoongi swallowed hard but kept his expression the same. This was for the kid&rsquo;s own good.</p><p>&ldquo;Then grow up, Jungkook,&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;Stop being some weak little child. Stop depending on everyone else. Stop expecting everyone to take care of you and just man up.&rdquo;</p><p>This set something off in the boy. In one quick motion, Jungkook stepped forward and gripped the front of Yoongi&rsquo;s shirt in his fists. Fire burned in his eyes and Yoongi could feel the fear rushing through his veins like ice water.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to hit me, Kook?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Then hit me.&rdquo;</p><p>With a shake of his head, Jungkook let Yoongi go, dropping him back onto his feet, and he stumbled backward. A pathetic chuckle bubbled up from his throat and he shook his head. &ldquo;Not even man enough to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, Yoongi was wrenched forward again by his collar and he felt Jungkook&rsquo;s fist connect with his cheek. The force knocked him to the ground and he landed hard on his hands and knees. His mouth filled with the bitter taste of iron and when he brought his hand up to swipe at his lip, it came away streaked with blood.</p><p>&ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; Jungkook said looking down at him. Then without another word, he went over, pushed the door open and glanced back one more time to lock eyes with the boy that had basically raised him. With that, he slipped out, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Yoongi exhaled heavily as he let his head fall back against the floor. His head was still spinning and his face stung and he could feel a trickle of blood dripping down from the corner of his mouth. He&rsquo;d never felt worse in his entire life. The hangover the next day was going to suck but not as much as the hole in his chest would after what he&rsquo;d just done. The look of betrayal on Jungkook&rsquo;s face would haunt him forever.</p><p>Already, feeling a bit soberer now, he could feel the guilt and regret flooding his chest making it harder to breathe. No. He couldn&rsquo;t do that to himself. This was for the best. He&rsquo;d already decided that when he took the job. He just wished things could have ended differently. Just wished he could come back once in a while to see everyone. Have them come visit him. But not anymore. Not after everything that happened that night.</p><p>With a groan, Yoongi rolled over and got to his feet. He was supposed to head out in the morning and he still had to pack everything up. All he wanted to do was sleep, but it looked like, once again, this was going to be another exhaustive night.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/92db9f47e53bed0af0272d792c6cb531/tumblr_inline_plripwTCSN1qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrozkJbhu1qe89j5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>07. Save Me</b></h2><p><i>You can only pick up the pieces and paste them back together so many times before they no longer fit.</i><br /></p><p><b>April.</b><br /></p><p>One evening when Jungkook was ten, he and his parents were driving home from the grocery store. This was a weekly occurrence with them. One he always looked forward to because he and his dad would race each other down the aisles. This particular night, it was raining really hard. So hard that the wipers were working at a rapid pace to try and keep the windshield clear and the street visible. The sound, though a bit jarring, was repetitive enough to turn into a sort of rhythm. One that had Jungkook&rsquo;s eyelids growing heavy until he slumped against the door, face pressed against his palm, and he drifted to sleep.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, it wasn&rsquo;t to the sound of rain on the metal car roof or the double time beat of the windshield wipers. It was to the beeps of monitors and quiet conversations between strangers. It was too bright. Too white. Too sterile. It took him several seconds to realize he was lying in a bed in a hospital room. And his parents weren&rsquo;t in there with him.</p><p>The night they were all coming home from grocery shopping, a semi truck had run a red light and smashed into them. His dad had been killed instantly and his mom only lived for another week before dying in the hospital of complications. The crash had put Jungkook in a coma and by the time he came out of it, he didn&rsquo;t have parents. He&rsquo;d fallen asleep on the way home from the store and woken up in the hospital two weeks later, completely alone in the world.</p><p>For several months after the wreck, he&rsquo;d withdrawn into himself, and while he barely ever spoke a word to anyone during that time, the voice in his mind screamed at the heavens, demanding to know why he had lived. Why his family had been taken. Why he couldn&rsquo;t have gone with them. He&rsquo;d heard a nurse say back in the hospital that the only reason he survived was because, since he&rsquo;d been asleep, his body was limp, therefore absorbed most of the impact, unlike his parents who, as anyone else anticipating a collision would, tensed up. It&rsquo;s why drunk drivers so often walk away from a crash when their victim doesn&rsquo;t. If he would have been awake, maybe he&rsquo;d be wherever his parents were too. Maybe they could be together.</p><p>He&rsquo;d been in the foster system ever since then. Being moved from fake family to fake family, &nbsp;temporary house to temporary house so quickly sometimes he didn&rsquo;t even get the chance to memorize his address. No one wanted a preteen. Once you were past the impressionable age, you were treated more as a guest in the house rather than part of the family. No one willingly took in older kids and teenagers because they wanted to. It was always for the money. At least, that was how Jungkook saw it.</p><p>He&rsquo;d learned that out of all of the kids he ever lived with, he was the expendable one. The one that didn&rsquo;t need attention. Didn&rsquo;t need love because he could take care of himself. Over time, he&rsquo;d learned to survive. To see his fake family as a provider of the bare necessities and nothing else. He&rsquo;d learned to never grow attached. To never let anyone in. To never even unpack his things because any day now, his case worker was going to knock on the door and tell him it was time to move on.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard not to latch onto the bitterness and let it fester inside you. Especially when there&rsquo;s such a lack of love in your life. Jungkook shut down, made a bubble around himself of anger and hatred. He&rsquo;d get into it with his fake siblings, with his fake parents. With anyone that looked at him wrong. He got into sports and started working out as a way to avoid home and clear his mind. He got bigger, more intimidating. People started leaving him alone.</p><p>Then in seventh grade, he saw a small boy get cornered by a group of guys much bigger than him. He didn&rsquo;t even hesitate before getting right in the middle of it, blocking the boy with his body and staring them down until they backed off. That was the day he met Jimin. The day he figured out that his strength could in fact be put to good use. Jimin introduced him to Tae and it didn&rsquo;t take long for the two to break down his walls. To show him that there were in fact people in this world that cared about him. That he could care about too.</p><p>When he met the rest of the guys, he found himself feeling angry less often. Smiling more. Laughing even. He couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he&rsquo;d laughed so much. They were his escape from the real world. The ones that kept him going. That kept him sane. He wanted to protect them with everything he had. Protect Jimin from the darkness that enshrouded him at school.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook slammed the front door to his house behind him and slung his backpack over his shoulder. His ears burned under the hood of his sweatshirt and hot tears glazed his eyes, threatening to spill over the moment he blinked. It seemed like more and more this was the way he&rsquo;d leave. With a shouting match between he and his fake dad and then a slam of the door.</p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s car idled on the curb, Jimin sitting in the passenger seat, his eyes following Jungkook as he trudged toward them.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, Jungkook,&rdquo; Jimin&rsquo;s mom said when Jungkook slid into the backseat.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he uttered and sniffed hard to keep the tears from spilling over. When his eyes were finally dry, he looked up, catching Jimin staring in the rear view mirror. The older boy&rsquo;s forehead was creased, the corners of his eyes dipped low with concern. Jungkook turned his head, tearing his gaze from his friend&rsquo;s and watched the houses rush by through the window. Then he felt his phone buzz in his pocket and he pulled it out.</p><p><b>Jimin: fake dad?</b></p><p>Jungkook glanced up again to see that Jimin&rsquo;s eyes were still trained on him through the mirror. With a sigh, he looked back down at his screen, his fingers typing out an answer.</p><p><b>JK: yea. im fine tho.</b></p><p><b>Jimin: ok</b></p><p>It was obvious Jimin didn&rsquo;t believe him but Jungkook was an impenetrable fortress that chose when to let people in and when to keep them locked out. He didn&rsquo;t like talking about his home life, especially to Jimin. The boy had enough to worry about with school and Jiho and therapy. The last thing he needed was to be triggered by Jungkook and his miserable situation. Jimin had always been an empathetic soul, though. And maybe that was why Jungkook had been drawn to him from the start. Jungkook was comfortable around him. He felt understood even though Jimin knew very little. The only other person in the group he&rsquo;d opened up to was Yoongi.</p><p>Yoongi.</p><p>The older boy had been like a big brother to him. Like a father. A protector. A home. His words still resonated in Jungkook&rsquo;s head, bouncing around in his skull like a ricocheting bullet. <i>I don&rsquo;t want you anymore.</i> He never thought he&rsquo;d hear that from Yoongi. His fake dad had drilled it into him that he wasn&rsquo;t actually wanted. That they only took in a fourteen year old with a temper because they knew he&rsquo;d be easier to manage than their younger wards. And money was money. As long as they kept him fed and clothed, they would receive a check every month. He expected that from them. But not Yoongi. Never Yoongi.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t believed he&rsquo;d heard his hyung right at first. That, for some reason, his ears had interpreted what the boy had said incorrectly. That maybe his mind had been playing tricks on him. But then the words hit him like a sledgehammer to the chest, bruising his ribcage and crushing his lungs. They&rsquo;d left him breathless.</p><p><i>You don&rsquo;t want me anymore?</i> He&rsquo;d had to be sure. Yoongi couldn&rsquo;t have said it. Couldn&rsquo;t have meant to say something that he knew would cause so much damage to the younger boy. That would leave him feeling so broken. So worthless. <i>You heard me.</i> And he had. And he heard him for weeks after that. Those words. Those words that pierced him to the core. That extinguished his spirit and left him groping around in darkness.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t want you anymore.</i></p><p>Leaving Yoongi&rsquo;s house that night, he&rsquo;d wandered the streets for a while, his anger and hurt slowly fading to numbness. And now he only ever felt one of the two. When he was angry he wanted to punch something or someone and when he was numb, he wanted to feel pain. Just needed to feel something.</p><p>He lashed out even more at his foster parents. At the other kids in the house. At his teachers and students at school. He got in a lot of fights. Provoked classmates and rough looking strangers on the streets. He was lucky no one ever pulled a knife or a gun on him. Though maybe he secretly hoped someone would.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay at my house tonight?&rdquo; Jimin asked once they&rsquo;d gotten to school and his mom&rsquo;s car had pulled away from the curb. &ldquo;Friday night&rsquo;s pizza night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t turn down pizza night,&rdquo; Jungkook replied, the corner of his mouth twitching up into a small smirk. Just the prospect of not having to go back to his fake family after school was enough to lighten his mood a bit. Just a bit, though. Yoongi&rsquo;s words still dragged him down into the icy depths of a dark ocean, but the thought of staying at Jimin&rsquo;s house at least gave him a chance to break the surface and take in a breath before being pulled back down again.</p><p>School had never really been a problem for Jungkook. He&rsquo;d always stayed pretty much in the middle academically. Never getting straight A&rsquo;s but never getting below a C. It kept his fake parents and the teachers off his back which was all that mattered to him. Though now with Taehyung no longer at school as he awaited his trial, Jungkook was having to rush from his classes that he didn&rsquo;t share with Jimin to meet the boy, sometimes forgetting to turn in his homework or stopping by his locker to grab his books for his next class. He was starting to fall a bit behind and his grades were reflecting it.</p><p>Jiho had left them pretty much alone for a while now. Sure, Jungkook saw him in the halls and sometimes would catch him just looking at Jimin but it seemed like making Jimin miserable was no longer on his agenda. Maybe he&rsquo;d finally gotten bored of tormenting him. Though Jungkook wasn&rsquo;t stupid enough to let his guard down, even for a second.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I forgot Tae&rsquo;s homework,&rdquo; Jimin said as he walked quickly down the hall toward his locker. He&rsquo;d been bringing work to Taehyung so the boy would still be able to graduate on time. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t grab it before class. I guess I was just in such a rush. It was stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Jiminie,&rdquo; Jungkook said. He almost had to jog to keep up. The boy was so much smaller than him, how was he covering so much ground so quickly?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been stressed out ever since Tae got arrested and all that crap and now you&rsquo;re having to work twice as hard and I just&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped in front of his locker, hand hovering over the combination dial. He squeezed his eyes shut with a sigh then looked up at Jungkook. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m so weak, Jungkook-ah.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook sucked in a breath, words of assurance at the back of his throat when he heard a locker slam a bit further down the hall. He and Jimin turned to find Jiho, by himself, coming toward them. Where were his friends?</p><p>&ldquo;So the rumors are true, then,&rdquo; Jiho said, his dark eyes sparkling as he leaned against the locker next to Jungkook. &ldquo;Your other guard dog got sent to the pound.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook was in Jiho&rsquo;s face in a second, teeth bared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about Tae like that,&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>The bully&rsquo;s eyes widened in fear for just a second before narrowing to slits, a devilish grin pulling his mouth upward. &ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; he asked quietly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t touch me. Not here anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna bet?&rdquo; Jungkook asked, stepping forward again, forcing Jiho to back up against the locker.</p><p>Jiho let out a dark chuckle. &ldquo;You want to hit me so bad right now, don&rsquo;t you, Pitt-bull?&rdquo;</p><p>He had no idea.</p><p>Jungkook could feel the muscle in his arm tightening and contracting with each clench of his fist. He wanted so badly to slam his knuckles against Jiho&rsquo;s skull. Make him think twice before ever even looking Jimin&rsquo;s way again. He was so sick of seeing the fear, the exhaustion, the misery in Jimin&rsquo;s eyes every day when he&rsquo;d come to school. Even though graduation was less than two months away, it still wasn&rsquo;t close enough. Jungkook didn&rsquo;t know if Jimin was going to make it. He already looked skinnier than he had even just a month ago. Much longer and he&rsquo;d wither away to nothing. Disappear completely. All because of this worthless piece of trash grinning up at Jungkook. He&rsquo;d been feeling so cold, so empty since Yoongi had abandoned him. But now fire built in his gut. Flames licked up his chest. Burned his throat and set his eyes ablaze. If there was one thing he knew how to do, it was protect his friends. And this worm was still threatening one of them.</p><p>He&rsquo;d had enough.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Jungkook,&rdquo; Jiho uttered so only he could hear. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any teachers around. Hit me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook felt a cold hand on his arm, fingers curling around his bicep. &ldquo;Jungkook-ah.&rdquo; Jimin&rsquo;s small voice was barely audible over the sound of Jungkook&rsquo;s heart crashing in his ears. &ldquo;Come on. He&rsquo;s not worth it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook turned his head to look at his friend. At his tired face. At his pallid skin. His hollowed cheeks. The boy looked like he hadn&rsquo;t felt happiness in years, yet somehow he still managed to greet him every morning with a smile. How was this boy still alive?</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Jimin,&rdquo; Jungkook said and glanced back at Jiho. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth it.&rdquo; Then he turned to meet his friend&rsquo;s eyes again. &ldquo;But you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Jimin could stop him, Jungkook reared back and threw his fist forward. It connected with a sickening crack against Jiho&rsquo;s cheekbone, sending the boy crashing to the ground on his hands and knees. A thick stream of bloody saliva dripped from his mouth and he spit onto the linoleum floor before looking back up to meet Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes. His face split in a wide, red stained grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, what did you do?&rdquo; Jimin whispered from behind him.</p><p>When he turned to look at him, Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes caught on someone over his shoulder. Principal Song approached with two of Jiho&rsquo;s friends trailing behind him.</p><p>He&rsquo;d been set up. Of course Jiho and his friends had planned this. Anything to get Jimin&rsquo;s second guard dog in trouble and out of the picture.</p><p>&ldquo;What on earth is going on here?&rdquo; Principal Song asked, his face red with anger.</p><p>Jiho&rsquo;s friends rushed forward to help the injured boy up and he stumbled a bit, playing up that he was really hurt. And he probably was. Jungkook had hit him pretty hard.</p><p>&ldquo;He just hit me, Principal Song-nim,&rdquo; Jiho said weakly. &ldquo;Just straight up punched me in the face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even pretend you didn&rsquo;t provoke him, Jiho,&rdquo; Jimin snapped from behind Jungkook then looked at the principal. &ldquo;He was just defending me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook,&rdquo; Principal Song barked.</p><p>Jungkook hadn&rsquo;t said a word or moved a muscle since first seeing the man coming toward him. The fire in his gut raged on, leaving his shoulders heaving and his heart pounding. His eyes drilled into the man as his fists clenched tighter. He could feel where the skin on one of his knuckles had split when it came in contact with Jiho&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Jiho. He wanted to make the boy suffer as much as he&rsquo;d made Jimin suffer since middle school. He wanted to make him wish he&rsquo;d never said a word to Jimin. Never laid hands on him. Jungkook wanted to kill him.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you hit this student?&rdquo; the principal asked gesturing toward the cowering Jiho.</p><p>Finally, Jungkook pulled in a steady breath to speak. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he told me to.&rdquo;</p><p>Principal Song opened his mouth but nothing came out. He obviously hadn&rsquo;t expected to hear that answer and now he flapped his mouth a few more times like a fish, his eyes darting back and forth between the injured boy and the one that had injured him. At last, he gathered his thoughts. &ldquo;We have a strict no violence policy here. You were all made well aware of that at the beginning of the year. Did you forget?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook clenched his jaw. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said through gritted teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;So what made you do it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been harassing Jimin since sixth grade.&rdquo; Jungkook said coldly. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo;</p><p>Again, the principal was stricken speechless. It took him just a few seconds to regain his composure. &ldquo;You not liking the way we do things does not justify taking matters into your own hands.&rdquo; Then Principal Song turned to Jiho and his friends. &ldquo;Please escort Jiho to the nurse and then all of you get to class.&rdquo; He waited as they made their way down the hall and disappeared around the corner. Then he turned to Jungkook. &ldquo;You know the rules, young man. You&rsquo;ll need to come with me. Back to class, Jimin.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook watched a look of horror pass over Jimin&rsquo;s face as the principal took Jungkook by the shoulder and led him away. He craned his neck around, keeping his eyes locked on Jimin&rsquo;s until they turned the corner. Dread filled his own stomach. If he was suspended, how would he be able to protect Jimin? He turned his head to look back at the principal.</p><p>&ldquo;Principal Song-Nim, you can&rsquo;t suspend me. Jimin can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The staff will do whatever we can to keep our students safe,&rdquo; the man replied sternly. &ldquo;He will be fine without you.&rdquo;</p><p>That was it. Jungkook ripped his shoulder out of the principal&rsquo;s hand and turned to face him. The boy was eye level with the man but more muscular and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a flash of cruel satisfaction when Principal Song took a slight step backward.</p><p>&ldquo;This school has done nothing to make Jimin feel safe,&rdquo; Jungkook growled. &ldquo;Something is going to happen to him while I&rsquo;m gone. Just watch. And when it does, I&rsquo;m not going after Jiho and his lackeys. I&rsquo;m coming after you.&rdquo;</p><p>Principal Song&rsquo;s eyes narrowed to shining black slits. &ldquo;That sounded like a threat, Jeon Jungkook,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And threats will not be tolerated at this school.&rdquo; Then he straightened up, standing eye to eye once again with the boy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no longer suspended.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wai&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re expelled.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook could feel the anger churning in his belly like an ocean in a hurricane. His fists clenched at his sides and his jaw became prominent as he ground his teeth together.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, if you don&rsquo;t want the police to get involved, I suggest getting off school grounds immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook watched out of the tops of his eyes as the man turned and strolled away and into his office. The whole inner wall was glass so Jungkook could see him go all the way across the room to sit at his oak desk. When the principal was finally seated, he looked up, locking eyes with Jungkook before reaching slowly for the phone. Obviously, he&rsquo;d been serious when he said he&rsquo;d call the police on Jungkook if he didn&rsquo;t leave right then. What else could Jungkook do but go? He couldn&rsquo;t go back to tell Jimin what happened. He couldn&rsquo;t return the next week to walk him to his classes. It was over.</p><p>With a defeated sigh, his angry expression fell and his eyes slid from the principal&rsquo;s down to the floor as he trudged toward the exit. What was he going to tell Jimin?</p><p>*</p><p>Jungkook waited at the bus stop across the street from the school until the students were let out at the end of the day. He couldn&rsquo;t risk being caught on the property and getting the cops called on him, so when he finally saw Jimin coming out the front doors, he jumped to his feet and waited anxiously there on the other side of the crosswalk like a dog at the end of his leash. His eyes followed the boy closely, never straying as Jimin pulled his hood up over his faded orange hair. He watched him make his way across the street, his hands jammed deep into the pocket of his hoodie. Watched him glance his way before shaking his head and trudging past him down the sidewalk.</p><p>Jungkook knew he looked ridiculous trailing after the boy like a puppy but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. He needed to apologize. Needed to explain. Needed Jimin to stop ignoring him. Please, just stop ignoring him.</p><p>&ldquo;Jiminie, just stop for a second. Please,&rdquo; Jungkook finally said, grabbing the smaller boy&rsquo;s arm and spinning him around to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you hit him, Jungkook?&rdquo; Jimin asked. He set his jaw in a hard line, his eyes drilling into Jungkook&rsquo;s and for the first time, Jungkook actually felt intimidated by his icy stare. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>With a sigh, Jungkook looked back at the school again. It was several blocks away now. Jimin had gone pretty far before Jungkook caught up to him. &ldquo;I just need to tell you something&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, please do, Jungkook,&rdquo; Jimin said. &ldquo;Tell me exactly what you were thinking. Tell me why you thought it would be a good idea to punch Jiho <i>at school</i> when you know that they&rsquo;ve been cracking down on their whole <i>no violence</i> policy, which is a load of crap, by the way, since apparently Jiho doesn&rsquo;t even need to touch me to mess with me every day. And now, you&rsquo;ve gone and gotten yourself suspended so what&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Expelled.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin went silent.</p><p>Jungkook didn&rsquo;t want to meet his eyes. He kicked at a clump of moss sticking up from between a crack in the sidewalk. Stuffed his hands in his pockets and grabbed at the lint that had collected in the seams. Rolled his tongue against his cheek. Until finally, the silence was too heavy to bear and he had to look up. </p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s icy facade had melted, leaving a stricken expression on his pale face. His lips were slightly parted, his shoulders heaving and then his fingers flew up into his hair and panic filled his eyes. &ldquo;Y-you what?&rdquo;</p><p>Immediately, Jungkook wished he could take everything back. Wished he hadn&rsquo;t let Jiho&rsquo;s comment about Taehyung get to him. Wished he&rsquo;d controlled the fire raging in him. Wished he&rsquo;d fought the urge to hit him. Wished he hadn&rsquo;t just uttered the one word that could make his friend suddenly look so scared.</p><p>Jimin&rsquo;s breathing turned ragged and he raked his quivering hands down his face. &ldquo;Expelled?&rdquo; he cracked. &ldquo;You got expelled? I won&rsquo;t have you? I won&rsquo;t have Tae? Jiho will&hellip;&rdquo; He staggered, almost crashing into the bushes lining the sidewalk if not for Jungkook reaching out and grabbing him. The boy&rsquo;s skin felt clammy, his whole body trembling. Jungkook had seen his friend have plenty of anxiety attacks but this was completely different. A panic attack worse than any he&rsquo;d ever had.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay, Jiminie,&rdquo; Jungkook whispered as he sank down onto the curb, enveloping the boy in his arms, letting him crumble into his chest as he descended further into panic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figure it out. You won&rsquo;t be alone. It&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; Jungkook knew he was making empty promises. He wasn&rsquo;t allowed back on school property. Tae wasn&rsquo;t going back to school, at the very least, until after his trial and that was only if he was found not guilty. And even then, school would be over anyway. Jimin was right. He was all alone. And it was Jungkook&rsquo;s fault.</p><p>*</p><p>It had been almost eight years since he lost his parents and the memories, the details, had faded over time. But sometimes, out of nowhere, his mom or dad&rsquo;s face would appear in his mind with startling detail, leaving him breathless.</p><p>This time it was a dream that they appeared to him in. More of a nightmare, really. He could see the crash happening. Hear the collision. The jarring sound of tires squealing, brakes seizing, glass and metal crumpling. He saw his mom&rsquo;s terror-filled eyes and heard her scream his name. And then he woke up.</p><p>It took him a second to realize he was laying on the floor in Jimin&rsquo;s room instead of sprawling across the backseat of a car. A layer of cold sweat coated his naked torso and matted his hair down to his forehead.</p><p>He heard a groan just then and watched as Jimin&rsquo;s arm stirred where it lay slung over the edge of his mattress. &ldquo;Jungkook-ah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Jungkook said sitting up and pressing his palms into his eyes. &ldquo;Just had a nightmare, Jiminie. Go back to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>With another barely-awake groan, Jimin rolled over to face the wall. Jungkook peered at him from over the edge of the bed. The boy&rsquo;s blankets had slipped off of him in the night and now he lay curled into a ball, his cotton pants riding up his legs to expose his boney ankles. He was so small. Too small.</p><p>Jungkook got up quietly and tugged Jimin&rsquo;s blanket back in place over his body. The boy nuzzled his pillow, never opening his eyes but letting out a contented sigh. At least he seemed to be having good dreams. With a sharp breath to clear his head, Jungkook reached for his shirt and tugged it on then grabbed his hoodie and slipped from the room quietly.</p><p>The whole house was dark and silent, the place awash in cold, blue light cast by the streetlamp that filtered in through the filmy curtains covering the windows. Jimin&rsquo;s house was nice. Not super nice like Jin&rsquo;s, but homey, comfortable. Jungkook felt a stab of jealousy in his gut as he made his way to the entryway where his shoes were. He passed walls lined with photos of Jimin in different stages of growing up. Family photos and birthday photos and school photos. Jungkook hadn&rsquo;t lived in a house where his picture adorned a wall in a long time. Having been shuffled from one place to the next so many times had made him forget what it was even like to have a place to call his. Sure, he&rsquo;d been with his current caretakers for a few years now but he&rsquo;d never go so far as to call those people his family or that house his home.</p><p>After pulling his shoes on, Jungkook unlocked and opened the front door quietly. It was unusually warm for a spring night but Jungkook welcomed the feeling of the wind on his face. He&rsquo;d woken up with goosebumps dotting his skin and this was the comfort he needed to wash away the image of his mom&rsquo;s terror-filled eyes.</p><p>He often went for walks when he needed to clear his head. So much had happened that day that this walk was necessary. Heck, the past several months had been nothing but one hit after another. From Taehyung killing his dad to getting arrested, to Yoongi suddenly flipping out on Jin and tossing Jungkook out like a piece of trash. Jungkook sucked in a sharp breath at that last thought. </p><p>He&rsquo;d made it to the end of Jimin&rsquo;s street, past the mini mart and out onto the main road that ran through the city. He wasn&rsquo;t sure where he was headed but it didn&rsquo;t really matter anyway. He could go on forever and no one would miss him. He already was nothing but a burden on the people that knew him. And he&rsquo;d let down the only one that didn&rsquo;t see him as such.</p><p>After hearing the same words for the past eight years of his life, that he was only as good as the money he brought in, that he needed to stop relying on others to take care of him, that he needed to grow up and be a man, it was hard to not believe it was all true. And then there was Jimin. His best friend and the boy that relied on him more than anyone else. The boy that trusted him to keep him safe and he&rsquo;d failed. Failed at his one responsibility.</p><p>Jungkook cut across the street and around a corner. The school loomed in front of him, its tall, white stone clocktower raising up to pierce the sky like a blade. Jungkook sat down on the bench he&rsquo;d waited for Jimin on earlier in the day and rested his head in his hands.</p><p>That dream had really shaken him. Had brought everything back. And now the hole in his chest that had finally begun to shrink with time felt gaping again. Without any warning, his chest contracted and he let out a sob. Then the tears came.</p><p>He buried his face in his arms, crumpling into a ball there on the bench as he cried. His voice echoed down the street, filling the darkness with sounds of anguish. He didn&rsquo;t know how long he cried but when he finally looked up again, his lungs hurt and his eyes burned.</p><p>Jungkook leaned back, resting his head against the back of the bench so he could look up at the sky. The city lights washed out most of the stars but the brightest ones were still visible. Shining and twinkling the way stars do, completely unaware or maybe uncaring of the trivial problems of humans. Stars have much bigger things to worry about.</p><p>With a heavy sigh Jungkook got up again. The air had cooled significantly since he left Jimin&rsquo;s house and now he hunched his shoulders forward and shoved his hands deep into his pockets to brace himself against the chill. He was exhausted and only now did he regret leaving the house in the first place. It was going to be a long, cold walk back.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t even see the car flying down the road toward him. The driver apparently didn&rsquo;t see him either because they didn&rsquo;t even attempt to slow down before plowing into him. The whole thing happened so quickly that Jungkook didn&rsquo;t know it until he landed on the road on his back with a sickening crunch. The impact ripped all of the air from his lungs and he lay there for several panicking seconds as he tried to will them to expand again. When he finally was able to pull in a breath, he knew something was wrong. He couldn&rsquo;t inhale right. When he tried to move his legs, they wouldn&rsquo;t budge. He couldn&rsquo;t feel anything. Something was definitely wrong.</p><p>His heart pounded in his chest and he could hear how ragged and shallow his breathing was. His vision blurred with every beat. The air grew thick and suddenly he felt like he was drowning. Panic washed over him like a wave and his unfocused eyes watched as the surface grew more and more distant. He was sinking further. Falling into the dark depths of the unknown.</p><p><i>Please, no. Please, not here. Not like this.</i></p><p>Jungkook could feel himself being tugged further down and he grit his teeth, struggling against current. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn&rsquo;t fight it. He could feel his energy draining. Feel his heartbeat weakening. The sound of it slowing seemed to surround him until it was all he could hear. Until there was nothing but him, floating in this black ocean, listening to his dying pulse.</p><p><i>Please&hellip;not like this.</i></p><p>He thought of Jimin, sleeping peacefully in his bed. He thought of Tae who still constantly wore that haunted look on his face. Of Hoseok and how lifeless he&rsquo;d become. Of Namjoon and how much he beat himself up over letting Tae down. Of Yoongi.</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi.&rdquo;</p><p>The name left Jungkook&rsquo;s lips in a cracked wheeze. His throat constricted and it took him several more seconds and too much energy to force the muscles to relax so he could breathe again.</p><p>What he wouldn&rsquo;t give to see Yoongi again. He just wanted to hear his voice. Wanted to hear him assure him that everything would be okay. That he would get through this. That what happened with Jimin wasn&rsquo;t his fault. Though he knew it was.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t want to die alone.</i></p><p>A sob broke free of Jungkook&rsquo;s throat and he took in another gasping breath before plunging below the surface of the dark ocean again. Memories of his life floated around him in the darkness. As if watching silent movies on a projector, his eyes roved over the familiar scenes. Of when he met Jimin, and the rest of the guys. When they had their first beach day. Of one of the many parties at Yoongi&rsquo;s where Jungkook spent the whole time on the couch stuffed between Jimin and Tae while playing video games. Of the first time he went to Yoongi after his fake dad told him he was worthless. Yoongi pulling him in for a hug, his arms holding Jungkook&rsquo;s broken pieces together. And finally, his eyes fell on a memory. A memory of him and his parents the night before his seventh birthday when the three of them were making cupcakes and he and his dad ended up getting into a frosting fight.</p><p>He focused on his parents&rsquo; faces. On the laugh lines creasing the corners of his mom&rsquo;s eyes. On the gray flecks of scruff peppering his dad&rsquo;s chin. These were the things he had forgotten over the years. The things that were so vivid and real to him now.</p><p>Suddenly the thought of dying didn&rsquo;t terrify him anymore. Now, instead, Jungkook could only feel an undeniable sense of peace. He&rsquo;d finally get to be with his parents. He&rsquo;d finally have a family again. He was so close to the edge, he could feel it.</p><p>At last, he opened his eyes. The black sky stretched above him and through the blurry film of tears, he could still make out the stars. Now they didn&rsquo;t seem like cold, uncaring orbs of light in the distance. They were much closer. So close he&rsquo;d be able to reach out and brush them with his fingertips if he had the strength.</p><p><i>Kook-ah. What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?</i></p><p>Jungkook blinked hard and sighed. &ldquo;Yoongi-hyung?&rdquo; he uttered, his words drawn out and slurred. He could feel himself fading fast.</p><p><i>Just hold on, Kook. Just keep fighting.</i></p><p>Jungkook&rsquo;s heart rate plunged again, his thoughts suddenly foggy. It was getting harder to breathe. &ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t&hellip;hyung.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Do it for us, Kook. Please. Do it for Jimin.</i></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;too&hellip;&rdquo; Jungkook could feel himself drifting in and out of consciousness, &ldquo;late&hellip;for Jimin.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Bull.</i></p><p>A puff of air escaped his nose in a weak laugh. He couldn&rsquo;t help feeling a twinge of sadness at the thought of leaving his friends behind. He felt the warmth of fresh tears spring to his eyes when he thought about the moments he&rsquo;d shared with them. The parties, the jokes, the meals at the diner. He&rsquo;d had nothing until he met them, and then they were his everything. He couldn&rsquo;t leave without saying goodbye.</p><p>With his teeth gritted against the pain, Jungkook slid his arm along the pavement, scraping the exposed skin of his wrist across the ground as he reached for his pocket. His energy was draining fast and he knew he didn&rsquo;t have much longer. By the time his fingers brushed the hem of his pocket, he was breathing hard. Just a little bit further. A choked sob fell from his lips when he realized his pocket was empty. His phone wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p>Exhausted, he let his head fall to the side, his fading vision landing on the cracked black device sitting next to him. He felt like he was going to cry with relief. His arm was too heavy to lift and for a few seconds he stared helplessly at his phone, the sound of his heartbeat slowing in his ears. But then he pulled in a breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Siri,&rdquo; he wheezed and then waited with bated breath until at last, the screen of his phone came to life and his mouth nudged up into a weak, triumphant smile. &ldquo;Call&hellip;&rdquo; Who could he call? &ldquo;Call Seokjin,&rdquo; he finally said. As the screen changed, he waited, closing his eyes and letting the sound of the ringing fill his head. It took four agonizing rings before Jungkook heard the sound of someone answering.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook&rsquo;s face crumpled at the sound of the familiar voice and he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Jin&rsquo;s voice echoed again. &ldquo;Jungkook-ah?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook sucked in as deep of a breath as he could. &ldquo;Hyung?&rdquo; he cracked.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook-ah? Do you know what time it is? Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook opened his mouth to respond but instead, a sob pushed its way out.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook? What happened? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; The older boy&rsquo;s voice rose with panic.</p><p>&ldquo;I tried, hyung&rdquo; he whispered letting his cheek fall to the pavement. He squeezed his eyes shut as another cry tumbled out. &ldquo;I failed. I failed Jimin&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You what? Jungkook, where are you? What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I failed Yoongi-hyung&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>On the other end of the line, Jungkook could hear faint rustling sounds as Jin got out of bed and started fumbling around in his room. &ldquo;Just stay on the line with me. Where are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook took in a wheezing breath as his surroundings began to fade. He tried to keep his eyes focused on the glowing screen of his phone where it lay close to his head. He couldn&rsquo;t feel his body anymore. He couldn&rsquo;t feel the cold air, or the rumbling pavement. He couldn&rsquo;t hear the sirens in the distance or the fact that they were growing closer.</p><p>&ldquo;Just tell the guys I love them. Tell them I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he whispered as the tears slipped past his eyelashes and slid down his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, stop,&rdquo; Jin cracked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that. Just tell me where you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook tried to open his mouth again, tried to draw in another breath but he was too tired. Too far gone. Instead, he closed his eyes, listening to Jin go on, his voice distorting as he yelled into the receiver. At least he wasn&rsquo;t alone anymore.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5278d232b602c34d39793022179c7c5d/tumblr_inline_plriraA9Do1qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp0ciuWY1qe89j5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>08. Butterfly</b></h2><p><i>Before the gaps are too wide. Before the whole thing becomes useless.</i><br /></p><p><b>May.</b></p><p>It had been a week since Hoseok had gotten the call from a distraught Jimin that Jungkook had been hit by a car. He&rsquo;d rushed to throw his clothes on and swipe his keys off his dresser before tearing out of his house so quickly, the walls trembled with the slam of the door. His poor car could barely keep up with how hard he laid on the gas pedal, the tires protesting loudly around every turn. Luckily, there were no other cars out at this hour because, though he was driving fast, Hoseok couldn&rsquo;t actually see very clearly through the panicked tears that blurred his vision.</p><p>By the time he&rsquo;d gotten to the hospital, they&rsquo;d already taken Jungkook back. He saw Jin first. The boy looked like he&rsquo;d been woken out of a dead sleep, his face all puffy, his hair sticking out every which way, a hoodie thrown on over his white t-shirt and sweatpants. He was bent at an odd angle over the arm of the chair, leaning into the one next to him.</p><p>It was only when the younger boy lifted his head that Hoseok saw that it was Jimin crumpled in Jin&rsquo;s arms. He was trembling, his small hands in his hair, his face so red and puffy that his eyes were just dark slits. He didn&rsquo;t even have a coat on. Just his light blue, cotton pajamas and a pair of shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Hobi-hyung?&rdquo; he cracked, his voice breaking.</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s heart dropped at the sound of his voice and he rushed forward falling to his knees in front of him. &ldquo;What happened? Is Jungkook&hellip;did he&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jin said as steadily as he could, though Hoseok could still detect a hitch in his voice. The oldest was trying so hard to keep it together for Jimin. &ldquo;They just took him back a couple minutes ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t breathing well,&rdquo; Jimin added. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; His bottom lip quivered and he pulled it into his mouth and shook his head. Then his face twisted in anguish and he fell forward with a sob, his head landing on Hoseok&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>Hoseok immediately wrapped his arms around the younger boy&rsquo;s neck and stroked his hair, whispering gentle reassurances in his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Namjoon?&rdquo; Jin asked quietly. &ldquo;I texted him. Figured he&rsquo;d come with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok looked up to meet his eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s working tonight.&rdquo; Namjoon had been staying at Hoseok&rsquo;s house now for a couple of weeks and had finally gotten a job doing night shift janitorial work at an office building. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;ll see your text before&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The doors to the waiting room burst open as Namjoon&mdash;still in his work coveralls&mdash;stumbled in. His eyes were wide as they scanned the room before settling on the three boys in the corner.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he asked hurrying toward them. &ldquo;I got a text from Jin-hyung about Jungkook&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was in an accident, Joonie,&rdquo; Hoseok whispered.</p><p>At the sight of Jimin still limp against Hoseok&rsquo;s shoulder, Namjoon deflated entirely, his face going pale, his jaw slackening. He looked to Jin. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jin said cutting him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, did anyone call Yoongi-hyung?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tae&rsquo;s trying to get ahold of him right now,&rdquo; Jin said.</p><p>The four were silent for a while. The almost empty waiting room seemed too cold, too bright, too harsh for the situation. Hoseok wished he could turn all the lights off. He just wanted to shield Jimin from everything. From the prying, mock-sympathetic eyes of the few other people sitting in there. From the sounds of reception&mdash;the hushed conversations, the joking banter of the staff just trying to make it through their shift. It wasn&rsquo;t right. Their friend was <i>dying</i>. Why did nobody else care?</p><p>*</p><p>Jimin had spent all of his free time at the hospital after that. Though they&rsquo;d gotten word a few hours after getting there the first night that Jungkook was stable but unconscious and that his condition had stayed pretty much the same all week, Jimin still went. Still sat in the waiting room, asking anyone that came out of the swinging doors if there had been any change. There never was.</p><p>Hoseok would accompany him on the days he felt he could drag himself out of bed, which wasn&rsquo;t often.</p><p>It had been eight months since he threw his painkillers in the bonfire on Beach Day and he&rsquo;d been regretting it every day since then. The first few weeks were spent in his bed, his skin clammy and feverish as he fought through the withdrawals. He&rsquo;d tried quitting cold turkey before but had never lasted longer than a week before going back to them. He never thought he&rsquo;d make it this far. Though if the withdrawal symptoms didn&rsquo;t let up soon, he didn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;d do. He didn&rsquo;t know how much more of this pain he could take.</p><p>It had been three years since Hoseok&rsquo;s accident. Only two months of that were supposed to be with the painkillers and then he was supposed to be prescribed something weaker. But the severe pain lasted and the longer Hoseok stayed on his opioids, the further into addiction he fell, until he couldn&rsquo;t even function in the morning without first popping a few pills.</p><p>Three years. Three years of wandering through life in a fog. Of never being able to get his hands to stop quivering, and he could feel it, even if no one else noticed. Of pretending that he wasn&rsquo;t higher than a kite&mdash;especially around his friends. He&rsquo;d gotten really good at faking normal. It had become the only normal he knew.</p><p>*</p><p>Before his accident, Hoseok had been an incredible dancer. He&rsquo;d been doing it practically since he could walk and he was well on his way to becoming one of the best street dancers to ever come out of South Korea. His path was set. He had performing arts colleges lining up to accept him, scholarships already promised to him while he was still in middle school. A lot rested on his shoulders.</p><p>Then the night before his tenth grade showcase, he&rsquo;d decided to stay late after rehearsal. He&rsquo;d gone through his routine so many times, he knew every twist, every pop, every step perfectly, but still he just wanted to make sure. Had to make sure he had it positively nailed. That even the nerves over the fact that there were going to be college scouts in the audience watching his every move didn&rsquo;t distract him.</p><p>That night ended his dance career before it even had a chance to start. Hoseok didn&rsquo;t remember falling. In fact, looking back, he couldn&rsquo;t really remember anything from that night other than staring up at the ceiling in his hospital bed for literally hours, his head set up in an uncomfortable neck brace, and just letting the tears fall. His dreams were shattered the moment he heard the words &ldquo;severe spinal injury&rdquo;. There was no hope for a full recovery.</p><p>*</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s mom had been running the dance studio since before Hoseok was born. She used to bring him with her to work when he was just a baby, her students fawning over him, pinching his tiny cheeks and passing him around between them during their down time. As he grew up, he&rsquo;d join the classes, picking up on the choreography so quickly and so well that when he was finally old enough to be a student at the studio, his mom put him in with the advanced class. Even then, he spent more time helping her come up with the routines and teaching the class rather than being taught. Eventually, she gave him his own weekly slots to teach in. He loved it. He loved creating routines and watching as his students began nailing them, mirroring him and showing his own creation to him. He loved teaching the little, little kids, standing back amusedly watching them completely ignore his direction and do their own thing. More than that, though, he loved in the evenings after the last class had left, when the studio closed for the night and his mom had gone home.</p><p>He&rsquo;d stay there, just him in the empty studio, the lights down and everything washed in blue darkness. He loved dancing in the dark&mdash;in the dim light so he could only catch his reflection in the mirror when he was moving. It made him look like he was a part of the air. Like he was moving through water. A spirit, caught up in the slivers of moonlight for just a flash before he melted back into the darkness again. It helped him to feel the music better. To come up with his intricate choreography. It made him well-known in the city for being such a good choreographer. A ray of sunlight that liked to dance in the darkness. A contradiction almost as beautiful as the way he moved.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Still no change?&rdquo; Hoseok asked Jimin after the younger boy had slid into the passenger seat of his car. It was Thursday, and Thursday meant group therapy. When Jimin wasn&rsquo;t at the hospital, Taehyung was. Together, the two of them made sure that there would never be a chance of missing any new information.</p><p>Jimin looked down at his phone once he&rsquo;d settled into his seat, his thumb gliding over the smooth surface of his black screen. &ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; he uttered then looked up at Hoseok. &ldquo;Tae would tell me right away if there was, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok nodded quickly, not giving Jimin a chance to doubt it even further. &ldquo;Of course he would,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And no news is good news, right? It means Jungkook isn&rsquo;t getting worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or improving.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok bit the inside of his cheek. While his youngest friend&rsquo;s health was staying pretty much the same, Jimin&rsquo;s was getting worse. Without the protection of Taehyung or Jungkook, Jimin was now fully exposed to relentless tormenting from Jiho. Hoseok himself had called the school and talked to the principal but the man had said that they can&rsquo;t do anything unless Jiho physically touches the boy. It was like they didn&rsquo;t care about the fact that this was very obviously affecting Jimin mentally. Had there not been enough stories already on the news and online of kids killing themselves over bullying? Did no one care or even realize that words can do so much more damage?</p><p>Every day, Jimin was stepping onto the battle field the moment he entered the school building. Every day he faced an onslaught of mental assault. High school had become a war zone for him and Hoseok noticed every time he saw the boy that he was fighting a losing battle. The scars weren&rsquo;t visible but they were deep and they&rsquo;d be there forever. And no one would do a thing about it unless Jiho touched him.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you doing, Jimin?&rdquo; Hoseok asked knowing full well that the answer was not going to be good.</p><p>Jimin didn&rsquo;t respond at first. He just kept his eyes focused on the phone in his lap. His bottom lip quivered and his thumb continued to trace circles on his phone screen. Finally, he took in a shuddering breath. &ldquo;I miss him, Hobi-hyung&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered. His breath hitched. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;don&rsquo;t know if I can take much more&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s heart splintered in his chest and he gripped the steering wheel tighter. &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Tell me what would help and I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p>At last, Jimin looked up to meet Hoseok&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me he&rsquo;s going to make it. Tell me everything will be okay.&rdquo; Jimin swallowed hard. &ldquo;Tell me it&rsquo;ll all go back to normal again.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok closed his eyes and thought back to Beach Day. How could so much change in eight months when the group&rsquo;s friendship had never wavered in five years? Hoseok couldn&rsquo;t even remember the last time the seven of them had hung out without it somehow ending in an argument. Everything was different. And after Yoongi had gone off on Jin, kicked everyone out and moved, Hoseok didn&rsquo;t think anything would ever return to normal. At last, he opened his eyes again, turning his head to meet Jimin&rsquo;s. He could feel the fatigue keeping his eyelids from lifting all the way. His chest felt hollow and his bones felt heavy. But still, he pulled his mouth up into a smile. One not nearly as bright as the smiles he&rsquo;d produced in the past.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll all be okay, Jimin,&rdquo; he said, trying to make his words as convincing as possible. He knew he was lying. He knew nothing would ever go back to the way it was before. But that look on Jimin&rsquo;s face. That darkness, that dull absence of the spark that always used to light his eyes, that kept him going even though there was so much trying to push him back. It was all so present that Hoseok would say anything to give him just a little bit of hope. Just something to live for. He reached over and gripped the younger boy&rsquo;s hand. Jimin&rsquo;s skin was dry and loose, like there was too much of it for his shrinking body. &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Hoseok added onto the end.</p><p>The corner of Jimin&rsquo;s mouth twitched upward for just a second, as if that was as much of a smile as he could muster and then he nodded and turned away to look out the window at the students that had congregated in front of the school. Hoseok watched him for a moment longer. He could almost feel the longing Jimin felt as he watched the others interact. It looked so easy. So unattainable.</p><p><i>Please God, let things get better,</i> Hoseok pleaded silently, then shifted gears and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Hoseok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Mom,&rdquo; Hoseok called back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; He kicked his shoes off and tossed his keys onto the console table inside the door.</p><p>He heard commotion in the kitchen and followed the sounds until he reached the doorway, then he stopped. His mom leaned back against the counter, a glass of wine in her hand. Just about a foot away, stood a man he&rsquo;d never met before. The two had obviously been standing closer, doing who knows what&mdash;though with the flushed look on Hoseok&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s face, he could take a guess.</p><p>&ldquo;Seoki honey, this is Seojoon. I met him yesterday at the supermarket.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok just looked at the man who looked back and raised his hand in an awkward wave. &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said and Hoseok gave him a haphazard smile before shuffling over to the fridge.</p><p>&ldquo;Hoseok used to help me at the dance studio,&rdquo; his mom continued completely ignoring the fact that her son hadn&rsquo;t given her new friend the warmest greeting, &ldquo;he was an amazing dancer.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Is she seriously talking about me as if I&rsquo;m not even here? </i>Hoseok pulled a bottle of iced tea out of the fridge and closed the door.</p><p>&ldquo;His father and I had pretty high hopes for him before his accident.&rdquo;</p><p>Her words grated on his nerves, feeling like fingernails raking down his spine and he spun to face her. This new man friend of hers just nodded uncomfortably, his eyes barely even sympathetic. Of course he didn&rsquo;t want to hear about her poor poor son. In fact, he probably had been expecting a lot less talking.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to my room,&rdquo; Hoseok uttered then left the kitchen before his mom could say anything.</p><p>By the time he reached his bedroom and closed his door, his head was pounding. Therapy hadn&rsquo;t been something he&rsquo;d taken seriously in a long time but he still went for Jimin. And because it kept him out of the house for that much longer.</p><p>His mom and dad had split just a year after his accident, saying it had nothing to do with him even though he knew that was a lie. The only thing that had kept them together before that was their determination for their son to become a professional dancer. He&rsquo;d never even really seen them in the same room together unless it was absolutely necessary. They&rsquo;d spend dinners talking excitedly about Hoseok&rsquo;s next show or some new college that wanted him, but then once those conversations came to an end, there was nothing else to say. At least not to each other. They didn&rsquo;t care about the other&rsquo;s careers, didn&rsquo;t care about how the other was doing. It was all about Hoseok. Well, it was all about Hoseok as long as fame and fortune were in his future. Once those dreams went out the window, so did their marriage. It had been a loveless one anyway so what was the point?</p><p>Hoseok hadn&rsquo;t talked to his dad since the split. He&rsquo;d gotten a couple postcards in the mail from whatever new place his dad had traveled to but he hadn&rsquo;t gotten one in over a year. And his mom might as well have been absent. She spent some of her time at the studio and most out with strange men. This was the first one she&rsquo;d brought back to the house, though. A stranger in Hoseok&rsquo;s home. It made him sick to his stomach.</p><p>He lay down on his bed and unscrewed the cap from his drink as he stared up at the ceiling. His shoulders were achy and stiff, as per usual at this time in the evening. He&rsquo;d been taking much weaker painkillers just to take the edge off while he went through his detox, but he found that the low dosage was no longer doing enough for him. And he just always wanted to sleep. He wished he could sleep, but the pain kept him awake. The pain in his neck, in his shoulders, his spine.</p><p>With a sigh, Hoseok reached blindly for the bottle of Tylenol on his bedside table. The pills rattled in the container loudly, almost taunting him. <i>Take as many as you want. It still won&rsquo;t be enough.</i> He popped the cap off and tipped the bottle toward his mouth. Once he felt four land on his tongue, he recapped the bottle and took a swig of his tea to wash it down. He could feel them scrape all the way down his throat, flowing with the cold liquid to settle into the pit of his stomach like rocks.</p><p>He closed his eyes and listened to the familiar sounds of his room. His computer humming softly under his desk, the baseboard heater creaking as it turned on, the muted ticking of his analog alarm clock. These were the sounds that usually kept him awake at night. He could hear the shower turn off in the bathroom&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t even noticed it until it turned off, the silence becoming more absolute. Namjoon must have been getting ready to go to work. A couple minutes later, he heard the door open and close.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey man,&rdquo; Namjoon said to him and he opened one eye to see the younger boy coming out in his boxers and using a towel to dry off his pale blonde hair. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Jimin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean Jungkook?&rdquo; Hoseok asked sleepily.</p><p>Namjoon crossed the room to where his stuff was. He always kept his corner neat and tidy. He already didn&rsquo;t like the fact that he was encroaching on Hoseok&rsquo;s personal space so keeping his stuff as contained as possible was a must. At least in his eyes. Hoseok had told him time and time again that he didn&rsquo;t mind him staying. That he, in fact, enjoyed the company, especially, on nights when Namjoon was off and would stay up talking with Hoseok when the pain kept him awake.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I mean, Jimin,&rdquo; Namjoon said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Jungkook is getting all the care he needs. Jimin however&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not well, Joon,&rdquo; Hoseok interrupted and closed his eyes again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not doing well.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon was silent for a few seconds then sighed. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok swiped his tongue over his bottom lip then sat up quickly. &ldquo;Did you see my mom brought someone home?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon let out a chuckle as he grabbed his work coveralls out of his stack of neatly folded clothes beside his pillow and stepped into them. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said as he tugged them on. &ldquo;I scared the crap out of him when I came home from the hospital earlier.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d been there keeping Taehyung company for a couple of hours.</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know Tae&rsquo;s trial is the day after tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know,&rdquo; Hoseok said. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nervous wreck but that&rsquo;s to be expected,&rdquo; Namjoon said as he pulled his work beanie down over his head. &ldquo;Jin&rsquo;s dad thinks he&rsquo;ll be able to get him off with a temporary insanity claim.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were never caught, were you?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon looked down at his hands and bit the inside of his cheek. He shook his head. &ldquo;Tae won&rsquo;t let me confess. He told the police he did everything himself. If I say anything, it could ruin his trial. They&rsquo;d throw both of us in jail.&rdquo;</p><p>Neither of them said anything as they both mulled over that last statement. Here Jungkook was in the hospital, Jimin was going through his own personal Hell and Yoongi had ostracized himself from the rest of them, not to mention Jin had basically fallen off the face of the earth having not returned for a weekend from school since going to the hospital that first night. Taehyung and Namjoon going to jail would be the nail in the coffin. The group was so close to breaking, it wouldn&rsquo;t take much more to completely destroy them.</p><p>*</p><p>Namjoon had left a couple hours before and the sounds of Hoseok&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s awful flirting had finally died down, leaving Hoseok alone in the silence. He lay on his back in his bed, the lights off because even though he&rsquo;d taken that Tylenol, his head was still pounding. With a sigh, he grabbed his phone off the mattress next to him and turned it on. The screen was bright, sending a spike of pain through his eyes and into his skull. He couldn&rsquo;t dim it fast enough. When the ache subsided a bit, he opened his chat with Jimin.</p><p><b>hows it going?</b></p><p><b>&hellip;</b></p><p><b>Jimin: at the hospital. Something happened</b></p><p><b>Wat is it? JK?</b></p><p><b>Jimin: could you come?</b></p><p><b>On my way.</b></p><p><b>*</b></p><p>Hoseok reached the hospital in record time. Faster than the first night. Jimin was alone in the waiting room, sitting in the chair with his head in his hands. When he looked up, his face was red, his eyes shining. Before Hoseok could take another step, Jimin got up, walking over to him as he wiped his face with the sleeves of his oversized sweatshirt.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Hoseok asked.</p><p>Jimin wouldn&rsquo;t look at him. Instead, he kept his eyes trained on his fidgeting fingers in front of his stomach. &ldquo;H-he crashed and it took them a long time to get him stable again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do they know why?&rdquo; Hoseok asked feeling weak all of a sudden. He reached out to grab Jimin&rsquo;s arms, more for his own balance than to comfort the younger boy.</p><p>Jimin just shook his head. &ldquo;They have to do some sort of exploratory&hellip;thing. I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are his foster parents here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They were here for like an hour, earlier,&rdquo; Jimin said with a sniff.</p><p>The fact that Taehyung and Jimin were basically living at the hospital while Jungkook&rsquo;s fake parents had barely made any sort of appearance over the past month had his stomach churning with anger.</p><p>Finally Jimin lifted his head, a bruise becoming apparent on his cheekbone. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Hoseok asked nodding toward it.</p><p>Jimin brought a hand up to rub at the bruise. &ldquo;Jiho hit my locker door while it was open and it hit me in the face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I see this earlier?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I covered it up.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok raked a hand through his hair. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d claim it was an accident.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok hated Jiho. Hated him more than Jungkook&rsquo;s fake parents. Hated him more than his dad for abandoning him. Hated him more than his mom for bringing strange men into their home. He used to get his anger out in the studio. It was the only way to help him work through it. Then he relied on his pills. But he didn&rsquo;t have those anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;You look tired, Hobi-hyung,&rdquo; Jimin said at last breaking Hoseok out of his thoughts.</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s face fell. He <i>was</i> tired. Always tired.</p><p>&ldquo;Go home and try to sleep,&rdquo; Jimin said and pushed him gently backward toward the exit again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you if I hear anything else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be alone, Jimin,&rdquo; Hoseok said.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung is on his way.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was a lie or not but his skin was crawling and he needed some fresh air. So with a sharp nod and one last reassuring brush of his hand against Jimin&rsquo;s arm, he left.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t want to go home. He didn&rsquo;t want to stare up at the ceiling, his mind racing, his body aching as he tried to go to sleep. He didn&rsquo;t really know what he wanted. But somehow, he ended up at the studio. It looked abandoned. His mom had been working there a lot less, letting it fall to the wayside. But still, just the sight of it filled Hoseok&rsquo;s chest with warmth. He hadn&rsquo;t been there in years.</p><p>*</p><p>The sound of the light switch flipping on echoed through the empty studio. Hoseok stood there in the doorway for several seconds as his eyes adjusted to the suddenly bright room. A wall of mirrors loomed in front of him, his gaze meeting the one reflected back at him. He looked terrified. He felt terrified.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t stepped foot in the studio since before his accident. Sure, he&rsquo;d spent late nights in his room attempting to move the way he used to be able to, but those times always ended in pain and a trickle of angry tears. Those were the nights he&rsquo;d find himself reaching for his pills, swallowing more than he needed. The high didn&rsquo;t fill the gaping hole in his chest, though. The place where his passion had once burned bright. As bright as he was.</p><p>Everyone that knew him before his accident would say he was sunshine in human form. He always had a smile on his face that glowed almost as brightly as his sparkling eyes and his golden skin. He looked like a child of summer, made of everything that was pure and warm in the world. But that light had died there in his hospital room. He&rsquo;d felt it leave his body, as if his very soul had floated away, leaving him feeling cold and empty. The only light he&rsquo;d felt since then was the illusion created by the pills he took. Artificial sunlight. Nothing but fake happiness that faded with the high and left him exhausted and miserable all night long.</p><p>*</p><p>His footsteps sounded hollow as he made his way over to the speaker system. He plugged his phone into the stereo and shuffled through his music until he came to the right song. Then he picked the small controller up off the top of the stereo and made his way to the center of the room. For several seconds, he stood there in silence, looking at his reflection. It was too bright in the room.</p><p>With a huff, Hoseok went over and shut the lights back off, plunging the room into darkness. Much better. Then he went back and stood in the middle of the floor. With a deep breath, he pushed the play button on the remote and the room suddenly filled with music. The first time he&rsquo;d heard this song, he&rsquo;d closed his eyes to listen, his mind immediately conjuring up a stage, he in the middle of it. He&rsquo;d created a whole routine in his mind, playing the song over and over, using his imagination to move the way his body wasn&rsquo;t able to. He&rsquo;d practiced the choreography in his mind hundreds of times and now that he was here, now that his feet were planted firmly on the waxed floor of the dance studio, the music pumping out of the speakers, it seemed that this was the pivotal moment. He couldn&rsquo;t go back. He couldn&rsquo;t fail. If he did, this was really it.</p><p>He closed his eyes, feeling the music rise in him like the swell of a wave. It filled his chest then overflowed, spilling down his arms and flowing through his veins like electricity. Something ignited in him like a spark to gasoline and he began to move to the music. Immediately, he felt a twinge of pain at the base of his skull and he jerked, catching the back of his neck with a tensed hand. He dug his fingers into his skin, standing motionless until the pain finally began to ebb. <i>Take it slow, Hoseok,</i> he told himself then carefully rolled his neck from side to side, loosening up the muscle.</p><p>With a deep breath to calm his nerves, he started the song over. This time, he didn&rsquo;t try to replicate the choreography he envisioned. Instead, he only barely moved, making small motions with his body as he went over the dance in his mind. When the song ended, he did it again, this time letting his limbs make larger movements, though still smaller than he wanted.</p><p>He did this over and over, feeling the music and letting it take control slowly. With every reset, he could feel his movements becoming more fluid, more pronounced. With every roll of his body, he tensed for the pain but since his muscles were having a chance to stretch and warm up, it wasn&rsquo;t coming.</p><p>He moved through the darkness, the light from outside streaming in through the windows lining the wall high above the mirrors and he watched his form in the mirror, slipping in and out of the rays. Like a spirit dancing in shafts of moonlight. Still not perfect but getting closer.</p><p>Hoseok had lost count of how many times he played through the song. He just kept hitting the back button, losing himself in the music until finally, he collapsed onto his back, his mouth stretched into the biggest euphoric smile he&rsquo;d ever felt.</p><p>Maybe this was finally the end of his struggle. Maybe he could finally dance again. Finally live his dream. Finally leave the pain and the pills behind.</p><p>He was tired and he could hear his bed calling his name. With a groan, he got back to his feet. He was going to be sore the next day. Probably for several days after this but he didn&rsquo;t care. For once, he welcomed the pain.</p><p>When he grabbed his phone and unplugged it, he noticed a notification on his screen. A message from Jimin. It had been sent just a few minutes earlier. Hoseok swiped the message and brought his phone up to read it.</p><p><b>Jimin: I know you tried. I know youve done everything you could. I know I&rsquo;m letting you down. I&rsquo;m letting you all down. But I cant do this anymore, hyung. Living hurts too much. Existing hurts too much. Youll be fine without me. All of you.</b></p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s heavy breaths echoed through the room as he read the text over and over. At last he started typing out his own message.</p><p><b>What do you mean?</b></p><p>He waited less than a minute before sending another.</p><p><b>Jimin</b></p><p>No response.</p><p><b>Jimin answer me now.</b></p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s hands shook as his thumb tapped Jimin&rsquo;s name. An option came up to call him and he pressed it. As it rang, he sprinted out of the studio, not even bothering to lock it back up before making his way to his car. Voicemail. With a curse, Hoseok hit redial and got into his car. The engine groaned to life and the tires peeled out as he flew out of the parking lot.</p><p>He called over and over again as he drove to Jimin&rsquo;s house, not even wasting a second between calls before hitting redial again.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Jimin,&rdquo; he growled and hit redial again.</p><p>Voicemail.</p><p>With an angry cry, he threw his phone to the passenger side. It cracked against the window before disappearing down into the space between the seat and the door. <i>Please, let him be okay. Please, let him be okay.</i></p><p>The house was dark when Hoseok pulled up to the curb and jumped out. Jimin&rsquo;s dad was on a business trip for the next couple of weeks and his mom must have been out because the door was locked when Hoseok tried the handle. He banged on it with his fists, screaming Jimin&rsquo;s name until his hands hurt and when that got him no response, he grabbed one of the bricks lining the path and smashed it into the window beside the door. Ignoring the jagged glass, he reached in and stretched his arm as far over as he could until he was able to undo the deadbolt. The door rattled as he threw it open and rushed inside.</p><p>The place was dark and silent and Hoseok&rsquo;s panic grew as he went from empty room to empty room.</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Jimin, where are you? Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; he screamed.</p><p>His feet hit the stairs, echoing loudly as he took them two at a time. He flung open Jimin&rsquo;s bedroom door, eyes roving over the empty space. His shoulders heaved, his breath coming out in ragged wheezes and he whirled around again to face the hallway. The bathroom door was shut at the other end.</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s breath caught. &ldquo;No, Jimin,&rdquo; he whispered before running to the door. He tried the handle. Locked. He hit his still aching fist against it. &ldquo;Jimin!&rdquo; He rattled the handle until he was sure it was going to come loose in his hand. &ldquo;No no no no please no.&rdquo;</p><p>Finally, he backed up and began ramming against it. Wood splintered with every hit and his shoulder burned but he kept throwing himself against the door until at last, it gave in, swinging open with such force that it banged against the adjacent wall. Hoseok fell in landing hard on his knees. The bathroom was pitch black and he pawed at the wall next to the doorframe, finally finding the light switch and flipping it on.</p><p>The bathtub was filled to the brim with water, and there he was, a dark form beneath its surface. Hoseok surged forward and plunged his arms into the water, displacing so much of it that gallons spilled over the edge, drenching him and the bathmat before spreading across the tile floor and toward the carpeted hall.</p><p>He clutched Jimin to his chest, the boy&rsquo;s hair plastered over his eyes, his skin deathly pale, his lips blue from lack of oxygen.</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin,&rdquo; Hoseok cried shaking the boy. He lay him on the ground and started pushing hard against his chest. He&rsquo;d never performed CPR before and he hoped to God he was doing it correctly. Though maybe it didn&rsquo;t even matter anymore.</p><p>After a few pushes, he pressed his ear against the boy&rsquo;s chest. Nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Jimin,&rdquo; he grunted then grabbed the boy by the chin and the top of his head and bent down to try mouth to mouth. Jimin&rsquo;s lips felt cold and dead against his own but still he tried forcing air into the boy&rsquo;s lungs. Then he started doing compressions again.</p><p>He switched between the two over and over, his hope fading the longer Jimin went without responding. Tears streamed down his face and his own chest was beginning to ache from taking in such deep breaths to give to Jimin, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop. He couldn&rsquo;t give up. Jimin had to live. He had to be alright.</p><p>What could Hoseok do? He needed to call for help. He needed to find a phone. His own cellphone was still wedged between the seat and the passenger side door in his car, but he knew Jimin&rsquo;s parents had a phone in their room just next door. Should he stop doing CPR? Should he keep going until Jimin&rsquo;s mom got home? Who knew how long that would be? It would only take a second. Just two steps out of the bathroom, two down the hall and three to get into the bedroom and grab the phone. Then seven back. Could he make it? Could Jimin make it? He didn&rsquo;t have any other option.</p><p>With a silent plea, Hoseok leaned down to give Jimin one more breath before tearing himself away from the boy. He scrambled across the hall, grabbing the phone off of the nightstand and rushing back to start compressions again. He used one hand to continue to push against Jimin&rsquo;s chest as hard as he could while his other hand shakily dialed 911. Once the phone was ringing, he dropped it the floor so he could use both hands again.</p><p>&ldquo;911, what&rsquo;s your emergency?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please help,&rdquo; Hoseok said, his voice breaking on the second word. He dropped his head onto Jimin&rsquo;s chest as a sob racked through him. &ldquo;Please come. He&rsquo;s not breathing&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Through the anguish, Hoseok lifted his head again and continued pushing on Jimin&rsquo;s chest. He could barely hear the operator on the other end but he rattled off the address anyway and then went back to alternating between compressions and breathing into Jimin&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>His strength was diminishing. His vision tunneling. Everything was fading and Hoseok knew. He just knew that it was no use. He should just stop. Just come to terms with the fact that Jimin was gone. That he&rsquo;d failed the boy. But he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to stop. It was almost robotic by this point. His body was long passed exhaustion but he couldn&rsquo;t quit.</p><p>A few minutes later he heard the faint sound of sirens approaching and looked up to see red lights flashing on the ceiling from outside the window. Relief didn&rsquo;t reach him though as Jimin was still unresponsive.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Up here!&rdquo; Hoseok yelled, his voice hoarse.</p><p>A couple seconds later, two blurry shapes rushed into the bathroom, one pulling Hoseok away while the other replaced him doing CPR. Hoseok let the paramedic pull him out of the bathroom and collapsed against the carpet in a tired, wet heap. He couldn&rsquo;t move. He couldn&rsquo;t see. He could barely think. All he could do was breathe and pray with the last ounce of energy that Jimin would wake up.</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Hoseok finally gained enough strength to sit up, the paramedics had already taken Jimin away in the ambulance. Before they had gone, one paramedic had sat at the top of the stairs with him and asked him some questions. If he knew what happened. How long he&rsquo;d been doing CPR. He couldn&rsquo;t answer. He had no idea how long he&rsquo;d been there. Had no idea how long Jimin was underwater. He wished he knew something.</p><p>After a few more questions that Hoseok didn&rsquo;t know the answer to, the paramedic gave him a small card with his contact information on it and then they left. Hoseok sat in the dark at the top of the stairs for a long time debating on if he should stick around and wait for Jimin&rsquo;s mom to get home or not. He didn&rsquo;t want to. He didn&rsquo;t want to be in the house anymore. He was soaking wet and cold and exhausted and he just wanted to sleep forever.</p><p>His whole body hurt but somehow he still managed to get to his car and drive home. His mom must have still been out on her date and Namjoon was still at work so the house was silent. Hoseok stumbled into the bathroom, yanking his shirt off over his head and letting it drop to the floor. It hit the tiles with a wet slap.</p><p>His reflection stared back at him. His eyes were dull, defeated, unemotional. He felt as hollow as he looked. Every inch of him was tired. His body felt weak. His thoughts muddled. He could feel himself shutting down. He wanted to sleep. Needed to sleep. Needed to just be done with it all.</p><p>Hoseok reached up and opened the medicine cabinet. He stood there in silence, his eyes scanning the rows of pill bottles until they settled on the bottle of Benadryl. His mom suffered from seasonal allergies so she took these pretty regularly throughout the spring and summer. They always made her really drowsy. Perfect.</p><p>He brought the pill bottle down from its shelf and squinted in the dim light at the writing on the label. Disclaimers jumped out at him. <b>Caution.</b> <b>Warning.</b> <b>Danger</b>. None of those words held a negative meaning for him. They were promises. Promises of sleep.</p><p>With unsteady hands, he popped the cap off and tilted the bottle toward his open hand. The pills rained down, some slipping through the cracks between his fingers and disappearing down the drain but most of them collected in his palm. By the time the bottle was empty, he held a pile of small white pills. With one more glance at himself in the mirror, he lifted his hand and poured them into his mouth. It took several painfully dry swallows but he eventually choked them all down. Then he carefully replaced the lid and put the bottle back in its place on the shelf before leaving the bathroom and walking calmly down the hall to his room.</p><p>He lay down on his bed and closed his eyes. Images of Jimin&rsquo;s colorless skin filled his head. The boy&rsquo;s lips had been so cold and so dead. He didn&rsquo;t even look like him. Jimin used to be such a warm person. So happy even amidst his struggles. After Hoseok&rsquo;s accident, he&rsquo;d thought his life was over. He&rsquo;d lost all hope. But Jimin had pulled him up out of the darkness. He&rsquo;d been the last remaining glimmer of sunlight for Hoseok to cling to. His ray of sunlight. His little Jimin.</p><p>As he released a tired sigh, Hoseok felt a tear slip from beneath his eyelid, drawing a cold trail down his cheek. Without even realizing it, he&rsquo;d relied so much on Jimin. Relied on his joy, on his positivity, on the promise Jimin made on Beach Day after Hoseok had dumped his pills into the fire.</p><p><i>We&rsquo;ll help you through this, hyung.</i></p><p>The boy had hidden his own pain so Hoseok wouldn&rsquo;t see it.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m rooting for you.</i></p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s face twisted and he threw his arm across his eyes as the despair crashed over him. He could feel his chest tightening, his lungs seizing as his heart hammered against his ribs. Thoughts of the other boys flooded his mind. Images of Taehyung&rsquo;s boxy grin and lanky arms slung over Namjoon&rsquo;s shoulders to his bloody hands and haunted eyes. Of Jungkook&rsquo;s sparkling eyes and playful jabs to him lying in his hospital bed with wires and tubes sticking out of him. Of Jimin. Jimin. Sweet Jimin, golden-skinned and running on the beach to limp and lifeless, his wet, hair matted to his pale face.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t know if I can take much more.</i></p><p>Another sob clawed its way up Hoseok&rsquo;s throat, shaking the whole bed and he pushed his palms against his eyes. His breath was coming too fast, his thoughts pounding through his head like strikes from a sledgehammer. He&rsquo;d clung to that last ray of sunshine, that last hope, with white knuckled fists and then seeing Jimin there in the bathtub, watching his body being toted away by the paramedics, Hoseok felt it slip through his grasp. He could feel the light receding, feel it shrinking back like the tide. The darkness was taking over, creeping in like a slow moving poison. Taking over his mind, tinging his fingers black. His stomach was a churning mess. And at his center, a blackhole.</p><p>With one last shuddering breath, Hoseok relaxed completely. The drugs started to take affect and his heartbeat slowed, the ringing in his head, the cacophony of thoughts ebbing until nothing mattered anymore. </p><p>Nothing mattered.</p><p>He lay there in silence, his eyes still covered by his palms and just listened. Listened to his computer humming under his desk and the baseboard heater creaking as it warmed up and the little analog alarm clock on his nightstand. These sounds used to keep him awake all night, along with his racing thoughts and his sore neck. But now he didn&rsquo;t feel any pain. He was too exhausted to think. And the sounds became a last comfort that lulled him into a deep, endless sleep.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad985a2e4d26543fd87599c5f017cbbc/tumblr_inline_plrisuBP2L1qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e547ab4c3044821265ab7187f94afb/tumblr_inline_plrp0zjHYU1qe89j5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>09. Love Is Not Over</b></h2><p><b>Present Day.</b></p><p>Jin slams his palms down on the hood of the truck and rests his forehead against the cold metal. &ldquo;Just, please, God,&rdquo; he utters. &ldquo;Please let them all get here.&rdquo;</p><p>He hasn&rsquo;t heard from any of them since he left and only found out about Jimin and Hoseok from his parents. They didn&rsquo;t tell him until he returned because of course they assumed he&rsquo;d been in touch with his friends the whole time. Were they still his friends? After everything that happened, was there still anything between them? Were they even all still alive?</p><p>Yoongi&rsquo;s outburst back in March had felt like a punch to the gut. Jin had never held anything over their heads. He never thought he was better than any of them. The fact that Yoongi would say such a thing had cut him to the core. He hasn&rsquo;t talked to Yoongi since that night. In fact, besides updates from his dad about Tae&rsquo;s trial, he didn&rsquo;t hear about any of them while he was in Japan. Living unaware all summer, staying preoccupied with program activities while his friends were suffering at home. It makes him feel even sicker.</p><p>The ocean matches the churning in his stomach and he gulps hard, tears pricking his eyes as he glances down at his watch. Their usual meeting time has come and gone. He turns his head either way, looking down the stretch of empty beach in both directions. No one is coming.</p><p>Jin lowers his head again to rest it against the hood of his truck. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s over. Everything has slipped through the cracks and it&rsquo;s all his fault. He should have done more. He should have helped Taehyung the first time Namjoon came to him. He should have been there more for the others. For Jimin and Hoseok, Jungkook and Yoongi. For Namjoon. He knew the boy was sleeping in the gas station and he just let him.</p><p><i>What&rsquo;s wrong with me?</i></p><p>They were all dealing with so much crap yet somehow they still had so much fun together. They loved him, they cared about him, they laughed with him. He didn&rsquo;t deserve friends like them. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve any of what he&rsquo;s been given in this life. If he could, Jin would give it all away. He&rsquo;d trade anything to see his friends again. To hear their voices, to hold them close. But it&rsquo;s too late. He knows that now.</p><p>The wind whips the hair at the back of his head, blowing down the collar of his shirt, and leaving a trail of goosebumps down his back. He doesn&rsquo;t move even though he&rsquo;s freezing. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve to feel warmth. Not when it&rsquo;s his own fault that the world has grown so cold. He lifts his head, gaze falling on his red notebook, the pages fluttering. With a hard sniff, he picks it up, slamming it shut and trudges toward the shoreline. He stops at the edge, just out of reach of the tide and looks out at the water. In the distance, waves crash violently. He watches them fold into each other in a salty spray, crumbling under the weight of gravity. He feels like crumbling, himself. Maybe he could just walk in, keep going until the current sweeps him off his feet and pulls him under. He could let the sea wash him away.</p><p>Far away.</p><p>He looks down at the journal clutched tightly in his hands. A gift from his parents. They always believed in him. Always knew he&rsquo;d make something of himself some day. None of it matters to him anymore, though. He doesn&rsquo;t want to become a famous writer. He doesn&rsquo;t want to marry some perfect girl and have a perfect family and live a perfect life. He just wants his friends back. Nothing else matters. Not his career. Not his future. Not this stupid journal and everything it represents.</p><p>With a frustrated sigh, Jin grips the journal in one hand and draws his arm back behind his head. He&rsquo;s about to fling it as far out into the water as he possibly can when movement to his right catches his attention. With a jerk of his head, he locks eyes with Yoongi.</p><p>The boy freezes where he stands about ten feet from Jin&rsquo;s truck. He looks different. His hair is black instead of the mint green making him look even more pale than he already was. He seems smaller too, though maybe that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s standing next to the vast ocean.</p><p>Jin can&rsquo;t think of anything to say at first. Instead, he just stares, afraid that if he makes any sudden movements, the boy will disappear. But then at last, he finds his voice. &ldquo;You came,&rdquo; he utters.</p><p>Yoongi&rsquo;s shoulders relax and he brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Beach Day,&rdquo; he replies with a shrug.</p><p>Jin nods before turning and running to him, throwing his arms around the boy. Yoongi&rsquo;s own arms wrap around him, squeezing him tighter than Jin thought his strength could allow. A strangled cry falls from Yoongi&rsquo;s mouth, muffled by Jin&rsquo;s sweater.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, hyung,&rdquo; Yoongi cracks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for everything I said. I didn&rsquo;t mean any of it. I was drunk and pissed off and tired&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was all true,&rdquo; Jin interrupts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the worst friend. I could have done more to help. I should have done more. You can blame me. I deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi finally steps back, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his coat. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We all screwed up.&rdquo;</p><p>The two don&rsquo;t say anything for a while, Yoongi looking down at his feet in shame and Jin just watching him because he can&rsquo;t believe his friend is here. His chest still feels warm where the other held onto him. It still feels like a dream that he&rsquo;s just waiting to wake up from.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you talked to the others at all?&rdquo; Jin finally asks. He&rsquo;s been dreading asking the question but he has to know. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Jimin? How&rsquo;s Hoseok? Are they&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi looks up at last to meet his eyes. &ldquo;Well, uh&hellip;Hoseok&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you two talking about me?&rdquo;</p><p>Jin spins around, the momentum swinging his arms too far and causing him to stumble as he turns to face the source of the voice. Hoseok stands there, alive and golden-skinned, Namjoon trailing a bit behind him kicking at the sand, hands in his pockets.</p><p>&ldquo;Hobi?&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s lips curl into a warm smile, his eyes glittering and he makes his way closer, opening his arms invitingly. Jin steps into them, not completely believing that this is real. But the boy is warm, warm as a ray of sunshine and Jin closes his eyes, feeling the calm wash over him. The last he heard, Hoseok had swallowed a bottle of pills, but here he was, in the flesh, alive. Alive and warm and solid. Jin pulls his bottom lip into his mouth and bites down against the tight feeling in his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Hobi?&rdquo; he asks weakly then pulls back to look the boy in the eye.</p><p>Hoseok&rsquo;s own bright eyes are brimming with tears but he smiles through them and nods. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in rehab since June but yeah, I&rsquo;m doing better.&rdquo; Then he puts his hand on Jin&rsquo;s arm and squeezes gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin nods. &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey man,&rdquo; Namjoon says coming up behind Hoseok. He stayed back to give the two some time but he couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer.</p><p>He missed Jin too and it&rsquo;s apparent by the way he pulls him against him. When they part, Jin looks him up and down. He seems so much more put together than the last time he saw him. His skin looks healthier, the bags under his eyes are gone and his clothes look nice. He looks less ragged, so much more put together.</p><p>&ldquo;You look good,&rdquo; he says to the younger boy.</p><p>Namjoon nods, his dimples becoming prominent as he smiles. &ldquo;I feel good.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin nods back then his eyes shift over the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, looking past him back down the beach again. He&rsquo;s afraid to ask where the other three are. He wants to know what happened to Jungkook, to Jimin. His dad had told him that they&rsquo;d won Taehyung&rsquo;s trial, the jury finding him not guilty by way of temporary insanity and self defense and the boy and his sister had gone to live in the country with relatives. At least he can find some comfort in knowing one of his friends is safe. But not knowing of the others&rsquo; fate overshadows that greatly. Slowly, he turns back to Yoongi.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything from&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jin-hyung!&rdquo;</p><p>Jin spins around, his eyes scanning the beach frantically for the source of the voice. At last they fall on a shape running at him. He can&rsquo;t quite tell who it is by the blur of tears suddenly covering his eyes but a smile spreads across his face anyway as he watches them make their way down the slope of the hill parallel to the water. And then he feels his throat close up, a sob trying to push its way out when two more figures appear at the crest and quickly start their descent. He breaks into his own run, the wind pulling the tears from the corners of his eyes, his heart hammering in his ears as he nears them. Jin barely has time to register Jungkook&rsquo;s beaming face before he crashes into him, gripping the boy tight as the force of the collision sends them sprawling to the ground in a tangle of limbs. He manages to choke out only the first of many apologies when the breath is knocked out of him by two more crushing bodies.</p><p>&ldquo;We missed you, Jin-hyung,&rdquo; Taehyung yells in his ear</p><p>&ldquo;You were gone for so long,&rdquo; Jimin adds.</p><p>It&rsquo;s all too much for Jin to handle and he crawls out from under them, sitting back on the sand and burying his face in his hands as he sobs. Immediately, the others&rsquo; hands are on him, their cheeks pressed against his head, his shoulder, his back.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m s-so sorry,&rdquo; he chokes out and sniffs hard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I left you all. I&rsquo;m so s-sorry I wasn&rsquo;t there when you guys needed me. I&rsquo;m s-so&mdash;&rdquo; he lifts his head at last, his eyes meeting Jimin&rsquo;s. The boy looks different. Good different. His hair is dark, his skin golden, his brown eyes shining brightly. Jin cups the younger boy&rsquo;s face in his hands. His cheeks feel fuller than they have in a year. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive. You&rsquo;re alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright, hyung,&rdquo; Jimin assures him with a warm smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still in recovery but I&rsquo;m alright.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin turns to look at Jungkook. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re walking,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; the youngest replies with a relieved laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in physical therapy all summer. Yoongi-hyung came back from Seoul to take care of me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin looks back where Yoongi stands with the other two, his mouth set in an amused smile as he leans back against the truck watching them. &ldquo;What about the producing job?&rdquo; Jin asks him.</p><p>Yoongi shrugs. &ldquo;There will be other openings. This was more important.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mina and I are living on my aunt&rsquo;s strawberry farm, hyung!&rdquo; Taehyung chimes in and Jin can&rsquo;t help but burst into laughter at the boy&rsquo;s boxy grin that seems to take up his whole face.</p><p>The other three join him on their backs in the sand, dissolving into laughter that&rsquo;s perhaps a bit more hysterical than necessary. It&rsquo;s hard not to be overwhelmed with everything. It&rsquo;s all too much and yet Jin never wants it to end.</p><p>At last the laughter dies down and a heavy silence falls over the group. Jin sits up again, his eyes locking with Yoongi&rsquo;s. The boy&rsquo;s mouth tugs up into a sad smile. He still must feel guilty. <i>It&rsquo;s alright,</i> Jin thinks. <i>That&rsquo;s all in the past and we can start fresh now.</i> <i>I&rsquo;ll never leave any of you again.</i></p><p>*</p><p>They spend Beach Day the way they have every year in the past. Together. </p><p>The air is chilly, the wind sharp, but Jin doesn&rsquo;t even feel it. Instead, warmth blooms in his chest as he watches his friends enjoy themselves and that keeps the cold away. The temperature drops as the sun sets and, as always, they build a fire on the beach by the truck. The orange flames lick at the night air, casting a warm glow on the boys&rsquo; faces. They all look happy and it&rsquo;s the most beautiful thing Jin has ever witnessed. Sure, Beach Day must always come to an end. Sure, they&rsquo;ll have to get up tomorrow and face what lies ahead but they&rsquo;re together again. And they&rsquo;ll carry each other through whatever obstacles they&rsquo;ll face. And there will be many. Such is life.</p><p>Jin gets up from his spot between Yoongi and Jimin and brushes the sand off his jeans as he makes his way back to the truck. He opens the door and reaches in to grab his red notebook off the seat where he&rsquo;d set it earlier. It&rsquo;s so much colder out of reach of the fire and he sucks in a sharp breath through his teeth, bracing his shoulders against the chill as he carries his notebook to the front of the truck and lays it open on the hood. The moon shines bright, casting a cold glow over everything but what the fire&rsquo;s warmth reaches. And by this cold light, Jin flips his notebook open to the page he&rsquo;d been writing on earlier and uncaps his pen.</p><p><i>Let&rsquo;s not be like the vase shattered on the floor. Let&rsquo;s be stronger than the glue that takes these fractured pieces of our lives and puts them back together.

He can already hear voices seeping through the thin apartment walls and into the hallway, filling the fourth floor with the comforting voices of his best friends. Before he can even put the key in the door to his apartment, the one directly across opens. </p><p>&ldquo;Hyung!&rdquo; </p><p>Jin nearly falls over as a newfound weight lands on his back, a small set of hands wrapped around his shoulders. &ldquo;We missed you so much, we&rsquo;re starving!&rdquo; </p><p>Jin huffs before pulling the hands away from him and opening his door. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; His voice is teasing, the tone you use when trying to coax a child into using manners. </p><p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; Jimin whines while smiling so wide that his eyes are basically closed, smushed by his chubby cheeks. Jin has to resist the urge to pinch them, happy to see that they are no longer hollow like they were a few years back. </p><p>He pretends to ponder his answer before &ldquo;reluctantly&rdquo; sighing and swinging his door wide open. &ldquo;I guess I can make you something.&rdquo; </p><p>In reality, Jin knows that if he doesn&rsquo;t make food for the group, they&rsquo;ll most likely starve or order pizza for every meal. The rest seem to lose all brain cells when in the kitchen if the many near disasters are anything to go by. Jin distinctly remembers the time Namjoon not only burned one of his favorite pans but Jungkook also managed to get potatoes stuck to a plate and defied all laws of gravity. </p><p>&ldquo;Jin Hyung is making dinner!&rdquo; Jimin yells into the hallway beckoning the rest of their friends to Jin&rsquo;s small apartment. The first to rush out are Taehyung and Jungkook, which is no surprise as they both never stop eating. Pausing in the doorway, Jin waits for the rest to arrive before sighing as the other two apartments on the floor remain occupied. </p><p>&ldquo;Are Hobi and Yoongi still working on their mixtapes?&rdquo; Jin asks as he begins pulling pots and pans out of the cupboards. As a college student struggling to not accumulate student loan debt, all he has to make is an unhealthy amount of ramen. Jin proceeds to pick through his numerous flavors of packaged noodles when the door opens. Before Jimin can open his mouth to answer, Yoongi enters. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, Jin hyung. Look at you, you&rsquo;re a true college student.&rdquo; Jungkook snickers nearly earning him a whack on the back of the head. </p><p>&ldquo;Yah! You should be nice to the one who&rsquo;s making you food.&rdquo; Jin chides before pouring water into the pot. He can hear Jimin softly scolding Jungkook to be nicer to his hyung and smiles. Jiminie has always been such a sweetheart. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the mixtape going?&rdquo; Jin asks Yoongi while filling the pot with water. He glances in Yoongi&rsquo;s direction while turning off the faucet to make sure that the boy is actually taking care of himself. Yoongi had a habit of throwing his health aside for his music, but hopefully with Hoseok working alongside him, he will take care of himself.</p><p>To Jin&rsquo;s relief no dark under-eye circles contrast Yoongi&rsquo;s pale skin, a result of not venturing outside for five years. Yoongi only begins to answer when Jin is once again facing the stove. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going. I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s where I want it to be though. It feels incomplete.&rdquo; The maknaes fall silent listening to their hyung&rsquo;s worry, not sure exactly how to help since they have no knowledge of music composition. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you had Hobi listen to it yet?&rdquo; Jin asks pouring salt into the pot of water and turning on the stove. The faster he can get the water boiling, the faster he can cook the noodles, which means the faster they can eat. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s not quite sure either though. We just spent two hours listening to the tracks on repeat to try and see what&rsquo;s off.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you need another voice on your track, hyung? I would gladly volunteer.&rdquo; Taehyung smiles. Ever since Hoseok and Yoongi created Cypher Records, Taehyung who&rsquo;s their biggest fan, has been asking to be on a song every time it&rsquo;s brought up. Secretly, the duo have planned a song out just for Taehyung to feature on, but it&rsquo;s a gift for his birthday. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you thought about asking Namjoon hyung?&rdquo; Jungkook pipes up, munching on dry ramen. They all turn to face him, giving him questioning stares at his choice of a snack. He shrugs. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess I could ask Namjoon. Maybe having someone not directly involved in composition would help.&rdquo; </p><p>Jungkook smiles wide, bunny grin on display from the pride of helping a hyung. A few years ago, after Hoseok and Yoongi had begun creating their record label, Namjoon quit his janitorial job in favor of running the business side of the label. Since he&rsquo;s the only member of the group who&rsquo;s held a real job, Yoongi and Hoseok thought that he would be best. Namjoon ran everything from promotions to contracts and anything in between. He was the one running the hustle, meanwhile Yoongi and Hoseok were the face of the company. Although some may hate being only known in the background, Namjoon is happiest there. </p><p>Namjoon and Hoseok enter at last, the final two of the group of seven. The boys cheer when they enter and pull two chairs over. They all sit huddled together in silence, the sound of boiling water filling the room. It&rsquo;s a comfortable silence. The type you get after being with someone for so long, and Jin feels himself relax after a long day of classes. That is until Jungkook starts munching on another dry ramen packet. </p><p>&ldquo;Yah! Can you just wait?&rdquo; Jin yells exasperatedly. Jungkook pouts in response before slowly putting it down on the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;He eats all the time, hyung. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re surprised.&rdquo; Jimin says, ruffling Jungkook&rsquo;s hair affectionately. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, ever since he started playing intramural sports he&rsquo;s always hungry.&rdquo; Tae laughs before taking a bite of the dry ramen. &ldquo;Yuck! How are you eating this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; Jungkook mumbles. &ldquo;I gotta feed these muscles.&rdquo; Flexing his bicep, he gives it a slap for extra measure causing the boys to fall in a fit of giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook-ah put your muscles away, you&rsquo;re scaring me.&rdquo; Tae says. While Jungkook focused on becoming a muscle man, Taehyung has been more focused on eating the delicacies of life. Because of his new affinity for food, Tae and Jin have developed a stronger bond through their love of trying new dishes. Although, Taehyung does make sure to eat a handful of strawberries a day; they remind him of his days with his aunt and sister on the strawberry farm after the trial. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, children, dinner is ready,&rdquo; &nbsp;Jin says pulling dishes down from the cabinet. One by one, the boys pile noodles into their bowls before settling around the living room. There&rsquo;s only a small table in the kitchen that seats four, so they sit in a circle sprawled across the floor and couch. They&rsquo;re all silent, focusing only on eating after a long day of classes and work, until Jungkook starts slurping the remnants in his bowl. </p><p>&ldquo;Did we adopt a toddler?&rdquo; Jin remarks. </p><p>&ldquo;We adopted two.&rdquo; Namjoon pinches Jimin&rsquo;s cheek that&rsquo;s stuffed with noodles. Jimin&rsquo;s eyes go wide and a blush paints itself across his cheeks as he turns his gaze away. </p><p>&ldquo;I think if we&rsquo;re being honest, we&rsquo;re all just overgrown toddlers,&rdquo; Yoongi adds. </p><p>The boys all scoff and he rolls his eyes. Yoongi likes to think he&rsquo;s an adult. That he&rsquo;s finally outgrown his childish fears and that he&rsquo;s become more mature. But when he sits among his group of friends he still feels like he&rsquo;s a teen, mind filled with wonder and the feeling that nothing&rsquo;s impossible. It feels like everyday is Beach Day with the boys by his side. Like he&rsquo;ll never have to be alone like he was back in Seoul. </p><p>&ldquo;That would explain why I saw Jin throw his psychology textbook across the room yesterday and throw a tantrum,&rdquo; Hoseok says. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand! I have to memorize all the Psychosocial Stages. There&rsquo;s too many to remember,&rdquo; Jin whines, glaring at the textbook lying on the coffee table. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever thought about going back to creative writing? I feel like you were happier then,&rdquo; Hoseok responds. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I like psychology. It&rsquo;s just a much harder subject. I think with psych I&rsquo;ll be able to actually help people. I can save them from what you all went through. I can almost make up for not being there.&rdquo; The boys fall silent, each face more stoic than the next. Jin rubs his hands together nervously. </p><p>&ldquo;We forgave you a long time ago. You don&rsquo;t need to do this to pay us back.&rdquo; Namjoon reaches over to give a comforting squeeze on Jin&rsquo;s arm. </p><p>&ldquo;I-I know. I want to do this, though. Besides, if you ever do need me again, I&rsquo;ll be able to help.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well we appreciate it, hyung.&rdquo; Hoseok smiles. &ldquo;On a less serious note, I&rsquo;ve rented my mom&rsquo;s old studio. I was thinking of holding dance lessons when I&rsquo;m not helping Yoongi hyung in the studio.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them!&rdquo; Jimin yells. Ever since getting into college, Jimin has been trying to bulk himself up. He wants to be able to defend himself and not have to rely on Jungkook and Taehyung to save him. He doesn&rsquo;t want to have guard dogs anymore; he just wants them to be his friends.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them too!&rdquo; Taehyung yells from the kitchen, digging around the fridge for the carton of strawberries he keeps hidden. </p><p>&ldquo;How about we all take them? Hobi can get some practice in teaching unskilled students and we can learn how to dance. I&rsquo;d like to not look like the inflatable long-limbed man outside of car dealerships.&rdquo; Namjoon chuckles. </p><p>&ldquo;Bold of you to assume I don&rsquo;t know how to dance,&rdquo; Jin says. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Namjoon retorts. </p><p>&ldquo;Not the point.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well if we&rsquo;re mentioning new stuff we&rsquo;re doing, I&rsquo;ve decided to get into photography,&rdquo; Taehyung says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to capture the good moments of my life so I can forget the bad.&rdquo; \t</p><p>Jungkook looks at Taehyung before quietly saying, &ldquo;still getting the nightmares?&rdquo; </p><p>Taehyung nods. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not as frequent but every now and then I get them. They just stay with me a while. I think surrounding myself with physical copies of happy memories would help in keeping them from plaguing my mind.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take one right now?&rdquo; Jimin suggests and Tae nods enthusiastically before dashing towards his apartment. </p><p>When he returns, a large camera is in his hand and he sets it on top of Jin&rsquo;s psychology textbook. It&rsquo;s so thick that it puts the camera at least two inches above the coffee table. </p><p>After about two minutes of Taehyung yelling: &ldquo;move left, no my left!&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re too far, you&rsquo;re only half a body now&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jimin you can&rsquo;t sit in the back no one can see you&rdquo;, everyone fits the frame. Setting on the self timer, Taehyung launches himself across the laps of Jimin, Hoseok, and Yoongi who&rsquo;re all sitting in front since they&rsquo;re the smallest. They let out small huffs but still hug Taehyung to their bodies. The flash goes off and they all clamber back towards the camera to see the photo. </p><p>Thankfully, each boy is in frame and no one was accidentally decapitated. Staring at the photo, with the boys wrapped together in a tight hug, Jin feels warm. This right here is his family. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that it&rsquo;s not by blood or that they split apart at one moment, because Jin knows they&rsquo;ll always fall back together. They&rsquo;re like magnets, no matter how far they pull away, they&rsquo;ll always reconnect eventually.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ce66b521ba7c779ff02ec2ad756876a/tumblr_inline_plriy8h5v01qe89j5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",
