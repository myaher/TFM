        "answer": "<p>Tony sniffled and bit his lip. He wasn\u2019t going to cry. He refused to give Mason the fucking satisfaction. Anyway&ndash; <i>\u2018Stark men were made of iron\u2019</i>&ndash; he wasn\u2019t a sissy. And if he cried, that\u2019d only prove everyone right, and he <i>wasn\u2019t </i>a baby. He was younger than them, but he wasn\u2019t&hellip;</p><p>God, who even gave a shit anyway? They were just dumb college kids. Couldn\u2019t even grasp complex theoretical physics yet, so why did Tony want anything to do with them? They could keep to themselves, and Tony would do the same. So what, he\u2019d tried to pluck up some courage and sit with some of the other guys in his class and they\u2019d laughed him off the table? So what if Mason Fucking Mellors had stuck his foot out from under the table and sent him flying through the cafeteria to the jeering of the entire school? He didn\u2019t fucking care. It was an experiment, and it had failed, that was all. Record the data and don\u2019t make the same mistake twice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need friends. Howard told him that often enough- he needed to focus his mind on more important things. Inventions and weapons designs, taking on his father\u2019s mantle.\u00a0</p><p>(It was so lonely at stupid fucking MIT, so so so lonely, and sometimes Tony wondered whether anyone would even care if he&ndash;)</p><p>That night, he locked himself up in the workshop, bottle of whiskey in his too-young fingers, and promised himself he\u2019d create something worth giving a shit about. Something that\u2019d turn their heads, make them wish they\u2019d been friends with him. It was vindictive and childish, but he imagined turning them down. Saying no, he was better than that, better than them.\u00a0</p><p>He knew he wouldn\u2019t do it, not in reality. He was pathetic and desperate, and he just wanted someone to pretend they liked him. It didn\u2019t even have to be real. They could just smile at him, maybe, and Tony would use his imagination for the rest. It was better than eating alone, living alone, <i>being </i>alone.\u00a0</p><p>But anyway. He pretended that he would be cruel to them as he twisted and screwed the bolts into place. He pretended he would sneer at their backtracking, laugh in their faces when they tried to apologise. He got drunker and drunker with every passing thought, every line of code. By the time he was done 4 days later, the first, second, third bottle had long since been emptied, and his home was a mess. He could barely even stand straight, but as he wobbled on his feet, he heard the robot in front of him beep and stir, reaching out his claw to keep Tony steady.\u00a0</p><p>Tony looked up at it, glassy-eyed. It was bigger than he\u2019d initially planned. But the AI was fully functioning, and when it beeped, it sounded pleased. Tony could hardly even remember what he\u2019d programmed it to do, but whatever it was, he was sure it was super cool.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he slurred, reaching out a hand and then stroking gently along the bot\u2019s large claw. In response, it beeped three times, claw waving through the air like a bobbing leaf on a stream. Tony laughed.\u00a0\u201cY\u2019re g\u2019na be a&hellip; helper bot, right? Gonna help me?\u201d</p><p>Another beep. The claw rubbed against the side of Tony\u2019s arm, before opening and grabbing him, gently starting to tug him over to the chair at his desk. Tony blinked, stumbling to follow, and let his robot pull him down onto the seat. When the task was complete, the bot chirped happily and lifted its claw into the air like a fist-pump of triumph.\u00a0</p><p>Tony blinked rapidly, suddenly remembering the commands and codes he\u2019d programmed into the thing. He wobbled where he was sat and felt a painful sting behind his eyes, looking adamantly at the table for a moment as he willed the tears back. The robot paused, and then gave a confused beep. It must have thought it had done something incorrectly.

So what if Mason Fucking Mellors had stuck his foot out from under the table and sent him flying through the cafeteria to the jeering of the entire school? He didn\u2019t fucking care.

Something that\u2019d turn their heads, make them wish they\u2019d been friends with him. It was vindictive and childish, but he imagined turning them down. Saying no, he was better than that, better than them.\u00a0</p><p>He knew he wouldn\u2019t do it, not in reality. He was pathetic and desperate, and he just wanted someone to pretend they liked him.

It was better than eating alone, living alone, <i>being </i>alone.\u00a0</p><p>But anyway. He pretended that he would be cruel to them as he twisted and screwed the bolts into place. He pretended he would sneer at their backtracking, laugh in their faces when they tried to apologise. He got drunker and drunker with every passing thought, every line of code. By the time he was done 4 days later, the first, second, third bottle had long since been emptied, and his home was a mess. He could barely even stand straight, but as he wobbled on his feet, he heard the robot in front of him beep and stir, reaching out his claw to keep Tony steady.\u00a0</p><p>Tony looked up at it, glassy-eyed. It was bigger than he\u2019d initially planned. But the AI was fully functioning, and when it beeped, it sounded pleased. Tony could hardly even remember what he\u2019d programmed it to do, but whatever it was, he was sure it was super cool.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he slurred, reaching out a hand and then stroking gently along the bot\u2019s large claw.

Tony blinked, stumbling to follow, and let his robot pull him down onto the seat. When the task was complete, the bot chirped happily and lifted its claw into the air like a fist-pump of triumph.\u00a0</p><p>Tony blinked rapidly, suddenly remembering the commands and codes he\u2019d programmed into the thing.
