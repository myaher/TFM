How was yours?\u201d Phil smiled. He loved all of this little small talk that they did right after she got home from work. It wasn\u2019t the big and existential conversations that they got into when it was three am and neither of them could sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh you know,\u201d he said,\u00a0\u201cThe usual. I didn\u2019t wake up until late. I scrolled through Twitter a bit, did a bit of the laundry.\u201d He shrugged.\u00a0\u201cNothing too exciting.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid Dan end up coming over like he was supposed to?\u201d She asked. Phil shook his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, uh he\u2019s sick, so that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d She sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d she brushed her fingers down Phil\u2019s arm, sending chills through his entire body.\u00a0\u201cI hate that you\u2019re alone all the time since I have a job.\u201d She stood up and hugged him from behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou could always quit,\u201d Phil whispered back.\u00a0\u201cYou know that I make enough money for the both of us.\u201d He turned his head so he could look her in her eyes. Her beautiful blue eyes. She only hummed in reply.\u00a0\u201cNo I\u2019m being serious. I know how much you hate your job. I love mine and I know how much you hate yours. So quit.\u201d She shrugged and walked away to grab a glass of water.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Phil, you know how I feel about not having a job to help you out around here.\u201d Phil got up and walked over to her to hold her in his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust picture it,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cYou and me together. All day every day.\u201d He kissed her as a way to try and persuade her to actually do it even though he knew it wouldn\u2019t do much. He pulled her as close to him as possible.\u00a0\u201cAnd you could make up not being able to pay the rent to me in,\u201d he paused, a sneaky grin finding its way across his lips,\u00a0\u201c\u2026 other ways,\u201d he finished. Morgan kissed him and he smiled into it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by other ways,\u201d she asked in such a way that Phil was turned on even more than he was before. He knew damn well that she knew <i>exactly</i> what he\u2019d meant. But he was living for this. He decided to pick her up and sweep her off her feet. She gasped in surprise because this was something that he\u2019d never done to her before. He himself was surprised that he\u2019d actually managed it, but he wasn\u2019t about to let that surprise show.</p><p>\u00a0He carried her off to their bedroom. He put her down on the bed and straddled her, kissing her passionately everywhere that there was exposed skin. She gasped at his every touch. His fingers danced down her arms until they reached her hands that were resting at his waist. In one swift movement, he pulled his shirt off and threw it across the room. He kissed Morgan on the lips before getting off of her, suddenly realizing that he is, in fact, heavier than her and was probably hurting her.\u00a0</p><p>He played this as part of his plan by shimming his hips and grabbing her hands to make her stand with him. He grabbed the hem of her shirt and looked her in the eyes to get consent. She gave him a small nod, so he pulled it off of her.\u00a0</p><p>Phil always got caught off guard by the sight of Morgan in just her bra and a pair of jeans, he had no idea why. He had to back up and just admire how beautiful and sexy she was. Every curve placed perfectly, which wasn\u2019t always clear in the clothes she chose to wear. But it felt like their little secret because of that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said in a deep voice, the same deep voice that he knew she absolutely adored. She loved it so much that he tended to save it for moments like these.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop messing about and come fuck me,\u201d she demanded. Phil smirked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeing pushy today, are we?\u201d he teased.\u00a0\u201cOh well, that\u2019s no way to ask.\u201d He walked over to his shirt and acted like he was going to put it back on. She walked up behind him and tore the shirt away from him and forced him into a kiss. He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try that game with me mister,\u201d she said. Phil reached down and pulled his pants off without breaking the kiss. The chill of the room made goosebumps prick up all over. He pulled away and wiggled his eyebrows at her.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were going to do that,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why I did it.\u201d He let his eyes travel down her body as a hint to her that she still had clothes on and he did not. She stuck her nose in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe I changed my mind,\u201d she replied. Phil shrugged and pulled his pants back up.\u00a0\u201cHey, hey wait.\u201d She shook her head, unable to believe this.\u00a0\u201cI said maybe.\u201d She hated how he could tease her so much and make her want him more, but the second she tried to tease him, he could just use it against her, no problem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are the magic words?\u201d She crossed her arms and shook her head. Phil smirked and grabbed his shirt.\u00a0 She bit her lip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDaddy, please!\u201d she moaned. Phil shrugged and took his pants back off agonizingly slow. So slow that she had her pants and bra off before his jeans had even reached his knees. She wondered yet again what this man was able to do to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you have the condoms?\u201d Phil asked.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t need any baby Lesters running around here because you were careless.\u201d Morgan shook her head and walked over to the bedside drawer where they stored them. She handed one to him and she watched as he placed it on his length.\u00a0</p><p>Out of nowhere, he shoved her against the wall so hard that she would, no doubt have bruises from it, but she didn\u2019t care, she liked how he played rough. He kissed her from her neck to her breast than took a minute to bring her hard nipples into his mouth and suck. She moaned in pleasure and Phil smiled. He loved how submissive she was. Giving her pleasure his way was everything to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she moaned.\u201d Phil smiled, which momentarily threw him off of his rhythm, but he got back on it. He grabbed her hand hand lead her to the bed. He pushed her down so he was standing over her, his hands on either side of her head. He looked down to his cock and grabbed it. He knew that Morgan normally liked to start small, with fingers first, but today he was in the mood to just go for it. He eased it into her, waiting for a no that never came. He watched her carefully to make sure her body language wasn\u2019t telling him no either. The second she said no, this would no longer be fun, but she showed no signs of a no.\u00a0</p><p>He pulled it in and out, starting slow, but moved faster and faster as time went on. Morgan and Phil were both getting close, he knew from her moans and how he was feeling. He moved even faster to maximize the effect on both of them. As they both came down from their climax, Phil slowed down and eventually stopped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was so good,\u201d Morgan panted.\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d Phil didn\u2019t reply. He simply layed down, rolled over, and fell asleep.\u00a0</p>",

Phil shook his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, uh he\u2019s sick, so that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d She sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d she brushed her fingers down Phil\u2019s arm, sending chills through his entire body.\u00a0\u201cI hate that you\u2019re alone all the time since I have a job.\u201d She stood up and hugged him from behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou could always quit,\u201d Phil whispered back.\u00a0\u201cYou know that I make enough money for the both of us.\u201d He turned his head so he could look her in her eyes. Her beautiful blue eyes. She only hummed in reply.\u00a0\u201cNo I\u2019m being serious. I know how much you hate your job. I love mine and I know how much you hate yours. So quit.\u201d She shrugged and walked away to grab a glass of water.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Phil, you know how I feel about not having a job to help you out around here.\u201d Phil got up and walked over to her to hold her in his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust picture it,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cYou and me together. All day every day.\u201d He kissed her as a way to try and persuade her to actually do it even though he knew it wouldn\u2019t do much. He pulled her as close to him as possible.\u00a0\u201cAnd you could make up not being able to pay the rent to me in,\u201d he paused, a sneaky grin finding its way across his lips,\u00a0\u201c\u2026 other ways,\u201d he finished. Morgan kissed him and he smiled into it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by other ways,\u201d she asked in such a way that Phil was turned on even more than he was before. He knew damn well that she knew <i>exactly</i> what he\u2019d meant. But he was living for this. He decided to pick her up and sweep her off her feet. She gasped in surprise because this was something that he\u2019d never done to her before. He himself was surprised that he\u2019d actually managed it, but he wasn\u2019t about to let that surprise show.</p><p>\u00a0He carried her off to their bedroom. He put her down on the bed and straddled her, kissing her passionately everywhere that there was exposed skin. She gasped at his every touch. His fingers danced down her arms until they reached her hands that were resting at his waist. In one swift movement, he pulled his shirt off and threw it across the room. He kissed Morgan on the lips before getting off of her, suddenly realizing that he is, in fact, heavier than her and was probably hurting her.\u00a0</p><p>He played this as part of his plan by shimming his hips and grabbing her hands to make her stand with him. He grabbed the hem of her shirt and looked her in the eyes to get consent. She gave him a small nod, so he pulled it off of her.\u00a0</p><p>Phil always got caught off guard by the sight of Morgan in just her bra and a pair of jeans, he had no idea why. He had to back up and just admire how beautiful and sexy she was. Every curve placed perfectly, which wasn\u2019t always clear in the clothes she chose to wear. But it felt like their little secret because of that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said in a deep voice, the same deep voice that he knew she absolutely adored. She loved it so much that he tended to save it for moments like these.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop messing about and come fuck me,\u201d she demanded. Phil smirked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeing pushy today, are we?\u201d he teased.\u00a0\u201cOh well, that\u2019s no way to ask.\u201d He walked over to his shirt and acted like he was going to put it back on. She walked up behind him and tore the shirt away from him and forced him into a kiss. He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try that game with me mister,\u201d she said. Phil reached down and pulled his pants off without breaking the kiss. The chill of the room made goosebumps prick up all over. He pulled away and wiggled his eyebrows at her.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were going to do that,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why I did it.\u201d He let his eyes travel down her body as a hint to her that she still had clothes on and he did not. She stuck her nose in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe I changed my mind,\u201d she replied. Phil shrugged and pulled his pants back up.\u00a0\u201cHey, hey wait.\u201d She shook her head, unable to believe this.\u00a0\u201cI said maybe.\u201d She hated how he could tease her so much and make her want him more, but the second she tried to tease him, he could just use it against her, no problem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are the magic words?\u201d She crossed her arms and shook her head. Phil smirked and grabbed his shirt.\u00a0 She bit her lip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDaddy, please!\u201d she moaned. Phil shrugged and took his pants back off agonizingly slow. So slow that she had her pants and bra off before his jeans had even reached his knees. She wondered yet again what this man was able to do to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you have the condoms?\u201d Phil asked.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t need any baby Lesters running around here because you were careless.\u201d Morgan shook her head and walked over to the bedside drawer where they stored them. She handed one to him and she watched as he placed it on his length.\u00a0</p><p>Out of nowhere, he shoved her against the wall so hard that she would, no doubt have bruises from it, but she didn\u2019t care, she liked how he played rough. He kissed her from her neck to her breast than took a minute to bring her hard nipples into his mouth and suck. She moaned in pleasure and Phil smiled. He loved how submissive she was. Giving her pleasure his way was everything to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she moaned.\u201d Phil smiled, which momentarily threw him off of his rhythm, but he got back on it. He grabbed her hand hand lead her to the bed. He pushed her down so he was standing over her, his hands on either side of her head. He looked down to his cock and grabbed it. He knew that Morgan normally liked to start small, with fingers first, but today he was in the mood to just go for it. He eased it into her, waiting for a no that never came. He watched her carefully to make sure her body language wasn\u2019t telling him no either. The second she said no, this would no longer be fun, but she showed no signs of a no.\u00a0</p><p>He pulled it in and out, starting slow, but moved faster and faster as time went on. Morgan and Phil were both getting close, he knew from her moans and how he was feeling. He moved even faster to maximize the effect on both of them. As they both came down from their climax, Phil slowed down and eventually stopped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was so good,\u201d Morgan panted.\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d Phil didn\u2019t reply. He simply layed down, rolled over, and fell asleep.\u00a0</p>",
