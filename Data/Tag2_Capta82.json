Every time you touched her or smiled at her, she could feel her heart beat faster, and there seemed to be a million butterflies fighting around in her stomach. When she finally asked you out (after much pressure from Maria), there was nothing to stop her from taking care of you all the time. Carol will pull you onto her chest and hold you until you fall asleep. Having you sleeping peacefully on her makes her feel so lucky.<br/></li></ul><p><b>B = Body part (Their favorite body part of theirs and also their partner\u2019s)</b></p><ul><li>Carol loves your butt. She loves giving them a gentle squeeze when the two of you are together. However, the two of you can\u2019t be as out as you would like, so she has to be subtle with her touching. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together would know that you two are together, but most people still think you are \u201cbest friends\u201d.<br/></li><li>There are nights when you\u2019re extremely tired, and you just curl up next to Carol. She loves the way you touch her arms as you fall asleep. There is nothing that makes her feel better than when she lifts you up with the strength of her arms. The sounds that you make whenever she pins you down is enough to make her want to do that all the time.<br/></li></ul><p><b>C = Cum (Anything to do with cum basically)</b></p><ul><li>Carol knows exactly how to make you cum and she knows it. She will pretty much throw you on the bed and have you every which way before the night is over. However, just because she\u2019s a top doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t like it when you get on top. You can make her cum pretty easily, but you\u2019ve learned not to get too cocky because Carol can tease you for the longest time.<br/></li></ul><p><b>D = Dirty Secret (Pretty self-explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)</b></p><ul><li>Being in the Air Force together means that the two of you get to spend a lot of time both at work and off of work together. Most of the time, you, Carol and Maria are off bar-hopping or blowing off steam in the dormitories on the base, but Carol loves sneaking off with you to get some \u201cprivate time\u201d with her girlfriend. At this point, Maria knows to knock before she enters a room and to quickly close her eyes so that she won\u2019t see anything she doesn\u2019t want to.<br/></li></ul><p><b>E = Experience (How experienced are they? Do they know what they\u2019re doing?)</b></p><ul><li>Being the resident playboy of the female pilots, Carol knows what she\u2019s doing when it comes to making girls feel good. She\u2019s had her fair share of hookups, but when it comes to having a real romantic relationship, she might as well be flying in blind. However, Carol is willing to learn what it means to communicate and work hard for a healthy relationship if it means spending the rest of her life with you.<br/></li></ul><p><b>F = Favourite Position (This goes without saying.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol absolutely loves getting on top of you and making you squirm (and scream when needed). Feeling you squirm under her makes everything worth it in her opinion, and she can\u2019t get enough of you when she\u2019s extremely dominant. There is also the fact that she loves it whenever you get on top and straddle her with your legs. Feeling you on top of her, grinding into her lap makes everything worth it for her.<br/></li></ul><p><b>G = Goofy (Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc)</b></p><ul><li>Before you started dating, you thought that Carol was one of the most serious people you\u2019ve ever met. It made a lot of sense &ndash; <g class=\"gr_ gr_193 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"193\" data-gr-id=\"193\">being</g> one of the first female fighter pilots comes with a requirement of extreme focus. However, once you got to know her better, you realized that Carol loves a good joke. She loves it even more when she\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re laughing, and she tries to be as humorous as she can both in and out of the bedroom.<br/></li></ul><p><b>H = Hair (How well groomed are they, does the carpet match the drapes, etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t pay that much attention to what goes on down there because she has more important things to worry about, but she does keep it in control.<br/></li></ul><p><b>I = Intimacy (How are they during the moment, romantic aspect\u2026)</b></p><ul><li>Carol hasn\u2019t had anyone who she\u2019s been \u201cintimate\u201d with, so the whole taking care of other people romantically on a constant basis is still a new thing for her. She will do soft, romantic things that will melt your heart such as bringing you food and holding you close when you\u2019re in bed together. She also likes making sure you\u2019re okay after sex, and will stroke stray hairs out of your face with the most serious look in her eyes. When you ask her what\u2019s wrong, she\u2019ll say that the only thing wrong is that she doesn\u2019t have as much time with you as she would like. You reassure her that you know how important being a hero is to her and that you are happy as long as she is happy.<br/></li></ul><p><b>J = Jack Off (Masturbation headcanon)</b></p><ul><li>Carol has always been able to find an able and willing partner to get in bed with whenever she has felt the need to get off. Other than that, she rarely ever felt the need to touch herself. Ever since she met you, Carol couldn\u2019t help but think about you whenever she felt horny. Only when she actually slept with you did she realize that no fantasy she could have come up with would have come close to how good the real thing felt. She would rather sleep with you than touch herself.<br/></li></ul><p><b>K = Kink (One or more of their kinks)</b></p><ul><li>Carol\u2019s biggest kink is when you take control of the situation when you\u2019re sleeping together. She has to be in control of things everywhere else (she\u2019s Captain Marvel after all), and it feels good to give control over to someone else for a change, even if it\u2019s for a little while. It should come as no surprise that dirty talk is something that Carol is very good at, and she is pleasantly surprised that you\u2019re as good as she is when it comes to whispering filthy things in each other\u2019s ear.<br/></li></ul><p><b>L = Location (Favourite places to do the do)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is very old school when it comes to having sex with you. There is nowhere she would rather be than with you in your bedroom. When she brings you to the SHIELD base, she loves having you in her room all day and seeing you blush as Steve asks what happened to your neck. However, there is nothing like being in the apartment that you live in with her because from the furniture to the decorations on the walls, everything has your touch on it, and she loves that so much.<br/></li></ul><p><b>M = Motivation (What turns them on, gets them going)</b></p><ul><li>When the two of you are training together. Or when she catches you staring at her when she\u2019s doing something. Basically, everything that you do turns her on, and she makes no effort to hide how turned on she is. If you happen to be training together, she\u2019ll pin you down and make out with you. She loves it when she catches you staring and you blush or pretend you weren\u2019t just staring at her.<br/></li></ul><p><b>N = NO (Something they wouldn\u2019t do, turn-offs)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t really like being really rough with you because she\u2019s so strong. If she uses all of her strength with you she would pretty much break you in half. So instead of using all of her strength, she\u2019ll use just enough to leave marks on your hips. She really likes to spank you when both of you are in the mood for it. However, she doesn\u2019t like to really hurt you, so she won\u2019t seriously hurt you during sex.<br/></li></ul><p><b>O = Oral (Preference for giving or receiving, skill, etc)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is a giver in all aspects, so she loves eating you out on a regular basis. Every girl is different, and she will take the time to find out what you like. She will take her time kissing down your body and teasing you before getting to the best part of the night. There are nights when she will spend hours going down on you, and she\u2019ll only stop when she feels that you can\u2019t take any more of her tongue. She\u2019ll come back up with that smirk that you have come to know and love, and she will give you a deep kiss to show that she had as much fun as you did.<br/></li><li>Some nights Carol is less of a top than she usually is, and you are able to be the top for once. You\u2019re able to take care of Carol like no one else ever has, and she loves that about you. You know exactly what Carol likes, and you use this to your advantage. After eating her out for several rounds, you wink at her cheekily which causes her to get up on top again. She won\u2019t ever say this, but she loves it whenever you wrestle your way on top.<br/></li></ul><p><b>P = Pace (Are they fast and rough? Slow and sensual? etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol loves being gentle and soft with you. She has seen enough violence both in the field and while she was in the Air Force, so she wants to be as gentle as she can with you. She wants to take her time making you feel special, and this is shown through deep kisses and gentle touches. However, when she gets jealous, she won\u2019t hesitate to leave marks up and down your neck so that everyone can see that you\u2019re hers. There is just something about seeing her marks on you that turns Carol on beyond belief.<br/></li></ul><p><b>Q = Quickie (Their opinions on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is definitely the captain of quickies. Although she is somewhat more conservative with where the two of you have sex, she is getting more open to hooking up anywhere. Leaving your legs shaking as she walks away with a smirk makes her day. She knows how to make you want her for the rest of the mission. Carol is horny for you all the time, and she knows you\u2019re ready for anything when it comes to her.<br/></li></ul><p><b>R = Risk (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t like taking risks when it comes to you because she doesn\u2019t even want to explore the potential of seeing you hurt. However, that doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t willing to experiment with what\u2019s new.<br/></li></ul><p><b>S = Stamina (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last\u2026)</b></p><ul><li>If there is one thing that Carol is known for, it is her stamina. She can just go for round after round when she\u2019s with you. It seems like she can not get tired, and you\u2019re certainly not complaining. Whether it be five quick rounds and cuddles, or one long round that lasts the entire night, Carol can make you cum several times any and every night. It doesn\u2019t take her long to recover for another round, and she\u2019ll be on top of you after only a few minutes. Sometimes, she can be extremely tired and just go for one round, but you\u2019re not complaining because you just want to cuddle with her.<br/></li></ul><p><b>T = Toy (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t have that much experience with toys, but you do so you teach her what all the toys are used for. Being a quick learner, she gets the hang of things pretty quickly and becomes an expert in using the toys on you. Things like strap-ons and vibrators have become a regular thing that is used whenever the two of you together. She loves having you fall apart under her as she uses these toys on you, and it always makes her feel good whenever you\u2019re feeling good.<br/></li></ul><p><b>U = Unfair (how much they like to tease)</b></p><ul><li>There is no one better at teasing than Carol. She will tease you until you&rsquo;re begging for her, and then she&rsquo;ll tease you some more. During missions and such she will be extremely focused on what&rsquo;s ahead, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have fun after everything\u2019s over. The moment both of you are safe and on your way back to base, she will whisper in her ear of all the dirty things that are on her mind. Sometimes neither of you can get your hands off each other and will sneak off somewhere \u201cprivate\u201d on the ship to do your business, and everyone else on the team will pretend not to notice that you forgot to properly button up your shirt.<br/></li></ul><p><b>V = Volume (How loud they are, what sounds they make)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is not the loudest person that you&rsquo;ve slept with. At first, you thought that you were doing something wrong and that she was unhappy, but then you realized that it was just how she was. She will not hesitate to tell you that you&rsquo;re the best person she&rsquo;s ever been with (which is usually supplemented with a playful kiss).<br/></li></ul><p><b>W = Wild Card (Get a random headcanon for the character of your choice)</b></p><ul><li>Even though Carol is extremely busy with being an Avenger, she always tries to make as much time as she can to be with you. When she does get home (which is sometimes 2-3 in the morning), she&rsquo;ll watch you sleep for a little bit and then make you breakfast. There are times when being separated gets hard for both of you, but you understand that the world needs someone like your girlfriend to protect it. One of the reasons why you chose to join SHIELD was to protect people, so you understood why she was constantly gone. You aren\u2019t always assigned to go on the same mission as she is, which causes Carol to worry about your safety. Carol does her best to come back home as often as she can so you can spend as much time together as possible.<br/></li></ul><p><b>X = X-Ray (Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on in those pants, picture or words)</b></p><ul><li>Carol has always had a toned body that anyone would be jealous of, and both of you know it. She can easily pin you down during sparring sessions, and she does so with a little kiss at the end of every round.<br/></li></ul><p><b>Y = Yearning (How high is their sex drive?)</b></p><ul><li>This woman has one of the horniest people you have ever met, and she makes this known by wanting to have sex with you all the time. She loves being on top of you and hearing you moan her name. Also seeing you in her leather jacket (or wearing any of her clothing) makes her want you even more.<br/></li></ul><p><b>Z = ZZZ (\u2026 how quickly they fall asleep afterward)</b></p><ul><li>When the two of you are done trying to get on top of one another, you\u2019re pretty worn out. However, Carol sometimes still has some energy left over so she\u2019ll stroke your hair as you fall asleep. There is nothing like having you close to her, and now she can\u2019t sleep properly without having you next to her. Carol wants nothing more than to wake up next to your sleepy face every day, it\u2019s too bad the universe needs saving all the time.<br/></li></ul>",

She will do soft, romantic things that will melt your heart such as bringing you food and holding you close when you\u2019re in bed together. She also likes making sure you\u2019re okay after sex, and will stroke stray hairs out of your face with the most serious look in her eyes. When you ask her what\u2019s wrong, she\u2019ll say that the only thing wrong is that she doesn\u2019t have as much time with you as she would like. You reassure her that you know how important being a hero is to her and that you are happy as long as she is happy.<br></li></ul><p><b>J = Jack Off (Masturbation headcanon)</b></p><ul><li>Carol has always been able to find an able and willing partner to get in bed with whenever she has felt the need to get off. Other than that, she rarely ever felt the need to touch herself. Ever since she met you, Carol couldn\u2019t help but think about you whenever she felt horny. Only when she actually slept with you did she realize that no fantasy she could have come up with would have come close to how good the real thing felt. She would rather sleep with you than touch herself.<br></li></ul><p><b>K = Kink (One or more of their kinks)</b></p><ul><li>Carol\u2019s biggest kink is when you take control of the situation when you\u2019re sleeping together. She has to be in control of things everywhere else (she\u2019s Captain Marvel after all), and it feels good to give control over to someone else for a change, even if it\u2019s for a little while. It should come as no surprise that dirty talk is something that Carol is very good at, and she is pleasantly surprised that you\u2019re as good as she is when it comes to whispering filthy things in each other\u2019s ear.<br></li></ul><p><b>L = Location (Favourite places to do the do)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is very old school when it comes to having sex with you. There is nowhere she would rather be than with you in your bedroom. When she brings you to the SHIELD base, she loves having you in her room all day and seeing you blush as Steve asks what happened to your neck. However, there is nothing like being in the apartment that you live in with her because from the furniture to the decorations on the walls, everything has your touch on it, and she loves that so much.<br></li></ul><p><b>M = Motivation (What turns them on, gets them going)</b></p><ul><li>When the two of you are training together. Or when she catches you staring at her when she\u2019s doing something. Basically, everything that you do turns her on, and she makes no effort to hide how turned on she is. If you happen to be training together, she\u2019ll pin you down and make out with you. She loves it when she catches you staring and you blush or pretend you weren\u2019t just staring at her.<br></li></ul><p><b>N = NO (Something they wouldn\u2019t do, turn-offs)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t really like being really rough with you because she\u2019s so strong. If she uses all of her strength with you she would pretty much break you in half. So instead of using all of her strength, she\u2019ll use just enough to leave marks on your hips. She really likes to spank you when both of you are in the mood for it. However, she doesn\u2019t like to really hurt you, so she won\u2019t seriously hurt you during sex.<br></li></ul><p><b>O = Oral (Preference for giving or receiving, skill, etc)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is a giver in all aspects, so she loves eating you out on a regular basis. Every girl is different, and she will take the time to find out what you like. She will take her time kissing down your body and teasing you before getting to the best part of the night. There are nights when she will spend hours going down on you, and she\u2019ll only stop when she feels that you can\u2019t take any more of her tongue. She\u2019ll come back up with that smirk that you have come to know and love, and she will give you a deep kiss to show that she had as much fun as you did.<br></li><li>Some nights Carol is less of a top than she usually is, and you are able to be the top for once. You\u2019re able to take care of Carol like no one else ever has, and she loves that about you. You know exactly what Carol likes, and you use this to your advantage. After eating her out for several rounds, you wink at her cheekily which causes her to get up on top again. She won\u2019t ever say this, but she loves it whenever you wrestle your way on top.<br></li></ul><p><b>P = Pace (Are they fast and rough? Slow and sensual? etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol loves being gentle and soft with you. She has seen enough violence both in the field and while she was in the Air Force, so she wants to be as gentle as she can with you. She wants to take her time making you feel special, and this is shown through deep kisses and gentle touches. However, when she gets jealous, she won\u2019t hesitate to leave marks up and down your neck so that everyone can see that you\u2019re hers. There is just something about seeing her marks on you that turns Carol on beyond belief.<br></li></ul><p><b>Q = Quickie (Their opinions on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is definitely the captain of quickies. Although she is somewhat more conservative with where the two of you have sex, she is getting more open to hooking up anywhere. Leaving your legs shaking as she walks away with a smirk makes her day. She knows how to make you want her for the rest of the mission. Carol is horny for you all the time, and she knows you\u2019re ready for anything when it comes to her.<br></li></ul><p><b>R = Risk (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t like taking risks when it comes to you because she doesn\u2019t even want to explore the potential of seeing you hurt. However, that doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t willing to experiment with what\u2019s new.<br></li></ul><p><b>S = Stamina (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last\u2026)</b></p><ul><li>If there is one thing that Carol is known for, it is her stamina. She can just go for round after round when she\u2019s with you. It seems like she can not get tired, and you\u2019re certainly not complaining. Whether it be five quick rounds and cuddles, or one long round that lasts the entire night, Carol can make you cum several times any and every night. It doesn\u2019t take her long to recover for another round, and she\u2019ll be on top of you after only a few minutes. Sometimes, she can be extremely tired and just go for one round, but you\u2019re not complaining because you just want to cuddle with her.<br></li></ul><p><b>T = Toy (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t have that much experience with toys, but you do so you teach her what all the toys are used for. Being a quick learner, she gets the hang of things pretty quickly and becomes an expert in using the toys on you. Things like strap-ons and vibrators have become a regular thing that is used whenever the two of you together. She loves having you fall apart under her as she uses these toys on you, and it always makes her feel good whenever you\u2019re feeling good.<br></li></ul><p><b>U = Unfair (how much they like to tease)</b></p><ul><li>There is no one better at teasing than Carol. She will tease you until you\u2019re begging for her, and then she\u2019ll tease you some more. During missions and such she will be extremely focused on what\u2019s ahead, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have fun after everything\u2019s over. The moment both of you are safe and on your way back to base, she will whisper in her ear of all the dirty things that are on her mind. Sometimes neither of you can get your hands off each other and will sneak off somewhere \u201cprivate\u201d on the ship to do your business, and everyone else on the team will pretend not to notice that you forgot to properly button up your shirt.<br></li></ul><p><b>V = Volume (How loud they are, what sounds they make)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is not the loudest person that you\u2019ve slept with. At first, you thought that you were doing something wrong and that she was unhappy, but then you realized that it was just how she was. She will not hesitate to tell you that you\u2019re the best person she\u2019s ever been with (which is usually supplemented with a playful kiss).<br></li></ul><p><b>W = Wild Card (Get a random headcanon for the character of your choice)</b></p><ul><li>Even though Carol is extremely busy with being an Avenger, she always tries to make as much time as she can to be with you. When she does get home (which is sometimes 2-3 in the morning), she\u2019ll watch you sleep for a little bit and then make you breakfast. There are times when being separated gets hard for both of you, but you understand that the world needs someone like your girlfriend to protect it. One of the reasons why you chose to join SHIELD was to protect people, so you understood why she was constantly gone. You aren\u2019t always assigned to go on the same mission as she is, which causes Carol to worry about your safety. Carol does her best to come back home as often as she can so you can spend as much time together as possible.<br></li></ul><p><b>X = X-Ray (Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on in those pants, picture or words)</b></p><ul><li>Carol has always had a toned body that anyone would be jealous of, and both of you know it. She can easily pin you down during sparring sessions, and she does so with a little kiss at the end of every round.<br></li></ul><p><b>Y = Yearning (How high is their sex drive?)</b></p><ul><li>This woman has one of the horniest people you have ever met, and she makes this known by wanting to have sex with you all the time. She loves being on top of you and hearing you moan her name. Also seeing you in her leather jacket (or wearing any of her clothing) makes her want you even more.<br></li></ul><p><b>Z = ZZZ (\u2026 how quickly they fall asleep afterward)</b></p><ul><li>When the two of you are done trying to get on top of one another, you\u2019re pretty worn out. However, Carol sometimes still has some energy left over so she\u2019ll stroke your hair as you fall asleep. There is nothing like having you close to her, and now she can\u2019t sleep properly without having you next to her. Carol wants nothing more than to wake up next to your sleepy face every day, it\u2019s too bad the universe needs saving all the time.<br></li></ul></p>",

Every time you touched her or smiled at her, she could feel her heart beat faster, and there seemed to be a million butterflies fighting around in her stomach. When she finally asked you out (after much pressure from Maria), there was nothing to stop her from taking care of you all the time. Carol will pull you onto her chest and hold you until you fall asleep. Having you sleeping peacefully on her makes her feel so lucky.<br></li></ul><p><b>B = Body part (Their favorite body part of theirs and also their partner\u2019s)</b></p><ul><li>Carol loves your butt. She loves giving them a gentle squeeze when the two of you are together. However, the two of you can\u2019t be as out as you would like, so she has to be subtle with her touching. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together would know that you two are together, but most people still think you are \u201cbest friends\u201d.<br></li><li>There are nights when you\u2019re extremely tired, and you just curl up next to Carol. She loves the way you touch her arms as you fall asleep. There is nothing that makes her feel better than when she lifts you up with the strength of her arms. The sounds that you make whenever she pins you down is enough to make her want to do that all the time.<br></li></ul><p><b>C = Cum (Anything to do with cum basically)</b></p><ul><li>Carol knows exactly how to make you cum and she knows it. She will pretty much throw you on the bed and have you every which way before the night is over. However, just because she\u2019s a top doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t like it when you get on top. You can make her cum pretty easily, but you\u2019ve learned not to get too cocky because Carol can tease you for the longest time.<br></li></ul><p><b>D = Dirty Secret (Pretty self-explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)</b></p><ul><li>Being in the Air Force together means that the two of you get to spend a lot of time both at work and off of work together. Most of the time, you, Carol and Maria are off bar-hopping or blowing off steam in the dormitories on the base, but Carol loves sneaking off with you to get some \u201cprivate time\u201d with her girlfriend. At this point, Maria knows to knock before she enters a room and to quickly close her eyes so that she won\u2019t see anything she doesn\u2019t want to.<br></li></ul><p><b>E = Experience (How experienced are they? Do they know what they\u2019re doing?)</b></p><ul><li>Being the resident playboy of the female pilots, Carol knows what she\u2019s doing when it comes to making girls feel good. She\u2019s had her fair share of hookups, but when it comes to having a real romantic relationship, she might as well be flying in blind. However, Carol is willing to learn what it means to communicate and work hard for a healthy relationship if it means spending the rest of her life with you.<br></li></ul><p><b>F = Favourite Position (This goes without saying.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol absolutely loves getting on top of you and making you squirm (and scream when needed). Feeling you squirm under her makes everything worth it in her opinion, and she can\u2019t get enough of you when she\u2019s extremely dominant. There is also the fact that she loves it whenever you get on top and straddle her with your legs. Feeling you on top of her, grinding into her lap makes everything worth it for her.<br></li></ul><p><b>G = Goofy (Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc)</b></p><ul><li>Before you started dating, you thought that Carol was one of the most serious people you\u2019ve ever met. It made a lot of sense \u2013 <g class=\"gr_ gr_193 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"193\" data-gr-id=\"193\">being</g> one of the first female fighter pilots comes with a requirement of extreme focus.

She loves it when she catches you staring and you blush or pretend you weren\u2019t just staring at her.<br></li></ul><p><b>N = NO (Something they wouldn\u2019t do, turn-offs)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t really like being really rough with you because she\u2019s so strong. If she uses all of her strength with you she would pretty much break you in half. So instead of using all of her strength, she\u2019ll use just enough to leave marks on your hips. She really likes to spank you when both of you are in the mood for it.

Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn\u2019t have that much experience with toys, but you do so you teach her what all the toys are used for. Being a quick learner, she gets the hang of things pretty quickly and becomes an expert in using the toys on you. Things like strap-ons and vibrators have become a regular thing that is used whenever the two of you together. She loves having you fall apart under her as she uses these toys on you, and it always makes her feel good whenever you\u2019re feeling good.<br></li></ul><p><b>U = Unfair (how much they like to tease)</b></p><ul><li>There is no one better at teasing than Carol. She will tease you until you\u2019re begging for her, and then she\u2019ll tease you some more. During missions and such she will be extremely focused on what\u2019s ahead, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have fun after everything\u2019s over. The moment both of you are safe and on your way back to base, she will whisper in her ear of all the dirty things that are on her mind. Sometimes neither of you can get your hands off each other and will sneak off somewhere \u201cprivate\u201d on the ship to do your business, and everyone else on the team will pretend not to notice that you forgot to properly button up your shirt.<br></li></ul><p><b>V = Volume (How loud they are, what sounds they make)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is not the loudest person that you\u2019ve slept with. At first, you thought that you were doing something wrong and that she was unhappy, but then you realized that it was just how she was. She will not hesitate to tell you that you\u2019re the best person she\u2019s ever been with (which is usually supplemented with a playful kiss).<br></li></ul><p><b>W = Wild Card (Get a random headcanon for the character of your choice)</b></p><ul><li>Even though Carol is extremely busy with being an Avenger, she always tries to make as much time as she can to be with you. When she does get home (which is sometimes 2-3 in the morning), she\u2019ll watch you sleep for a little bit and then make you breakfast. There are times when being separated gets hard for both of you, but you understand that the world needs someone like your girlfriend to protect it. One of the reasons why you chose to join SHIELD was to protect people, so you understood why she was constantly gone. You aren\u2019t always assigned to go on the same mission as she is, which causes Carol to worry about your safety. Carol does her best to come back home as often as she can so you can spend as much time together as possible.<br></li></ul><p><b>X = X-Ray (Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on in those pants, picture or words)</b></p><ul><li>Carol has always had a toned body that anyone would be jealous of, and both of you know it. She can easily pin you down during sparring sessions, and she does so with a little kiss at the end of every round.<br></li></ul><p><b>Y = Yearning (How high is their sex drive?)</b></p><ul><li>This woman has one of the horniest people you have ever met, and she makes this known by wanting to have sex with you all the time. She loves being on top of you and hearing you moan her name. Also seeing you in her leather jacket (or wearing any of her clothing) makes her want you even more.<br></li></ul><p><b>Z = ZZZ (\u2026 how quickly they fall asleep afterward)</b></p><ul><li>When the two of you are done trying to get on top of one another, you\u2019re pretty worn out. However, Carol sometimes still has some energy left over so she\u2019ll stroke your hair as you fall asleep. There is nothing like having you close to her, and now she can\u2019t sleep properly without having you next to her. Carol wants nothing more than to wake up next to your sleepy face every day, it\u2019s too bad the universe needs saving all the time.<br></li></ul></p>",
                "content": "<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5eb7e0c35b96ab9251a822d5df6f24db/tumblr_inline_pp9aojJPIr1v9iecl_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Requested by anon:&nbsp;Nsfw alphabet with Captain Carol &ldquo;Avenger&rdquo; Danvers please &#128521;&#128527;</b></p><p><b>imma request this now because I&rsquo;ll probably forget if I don&rsquo;t: nsfw alphabet with Carol danvers - of course after you see the movie - love your blog btw &lt;3<br /></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>A = Aftercare (What they&rsquo;re like after sex)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is famous for flirting and hooking up with girls casually, but she knew there was something different about you the moment you came into her life. Every time you touched her or smiled at her, she could feel her heart beat faster, and there seemed to be a million butterflies fighting around in her stomach. When she finally asked you out (after much pressure from Maria), there was nothing to stop her from taking care of you all the time. Carol will pull you onto her chest and hold you until you fall asleep. Having you sleeping peacefully on her makes her feel so lucky.<br /></li></ul><p><b>B = Body part (Their favorite body part of theirs and also their partner&rsquo;s)</b></p><ul><li>Carol loves your butt. She loves giving them a gentle squeeze when the two of you are together. However, the two of you can&rsquo;t be as out as you would like, so she has to be subtle with her touching. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together would know that you two are together, but most people still think you are &ldquo;best friends&rdquo;.<br /></li><li>There are nights when you&rsquo;re extremely tired, and you just curl up next to Carol. She loves the way you touch her arms as you fall asleep. There is nothing that makes her feel better than when she lifts you up with the strength of her arms. The sounds that you make whenever she pins you down is enough to make her want to do that all the time.<br /></li></ul><p><b>C = Cum (Anything to do with cum basically)</b></p><ul><li>Carol knows exactly how to make you cum and she knows it. She will pretty much throw you on the bed and have you every which way before the night is over. However, just because she&rsquo;s a top doesn&rsquo;t mean that she doesn&rsquo;t like it when you get on top. You can make her cum pretty easily, but you&rsquo;ve learned not to get too cocky because Carol can tease you for the longest time.<br /></li></ul><p><b>D = Dirty Secret (Pretty self-explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)</b></p><ul><li>Being in the Air Force together means that the two of you get to spend a lot of time both at work and off of work together. Most of the time, you, Carol and Maria are off bar-hopping or blowing off steam in the dormitories on the base, but Carol loves sneaking off with you to get some &ldquo;private time&rdquo; with her girlfriend. At this point, Maria knows to knock before she enters a room and to quickly close her eyes so that she won&rsquo;t see anything she doesn&rsquo;t want to.<br /></li></ul><p><b>E = Experience (How experienced are they? Do they know what they&rsquo;re doing?)</b></p><ul><li>Being the resident playboy of the female pilots, Carol knows what she&rsquo;s doing when it comes to making girls feel good. She&rsquo;s had her fair share of hookups, but when it comes to having a real romantic relationship, she might as well be flying in blind. However, Carol is willing to learn what it means to communicate and work hard for a healthy relationship if it means spending the rest of her life with you.<br /></li></ul><p><b>F = Favourite Position (This goes without saying.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol absolutely loves getting on top of you and making you squirm (and scream when needed). Feeling you squirm under her makes everything worth it in her opinion, and she can&rsquo;t get enough of you when she&rsquo;s extremely dominant. There is also the fact that she loves it whenever you get on top and straddle her with your legs. Feeling you on top of her, grinding into her lap makes everything worth it for her.<br /></li></ul><p><b>G = Goofy (Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc)</b></p><ul><li>Before you started dating, you thought that Carol was one of the most serious people you&rsquo;ve ever met. It made a lot of sense &ndash; being one of the first female fighter pilots comes with a requirement of extreme focus. However, once you got to know her better, you realized that Carol loves a good joke. She loves it even more when she&rsquo;s the reason why you&rsquo;re laughing, and she tries to be as humorous as she can both in and out of the bedroom.<br /></li></ul><p><b>H = Hair (How well groomed are they, does the carpet match the drapes, etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn&rsquo;t pay that much attention to what goes on down there because she has more important things to worry about, but she does keep it in control.<br /></li></ul><p><b>I = Intimacy (How are they during the moment, romantic aspect&hellip;)</b></p><ul><li>Carol hasn&rsquo;t had anyone who she&rsquo;s been &ldquo;intimate&rdquo; with, so the whole taking care of other people romantically on a constant basis is still a new thing for her. She will do soft, romantic things that will melt your heart such as bringing you food and holding you close when you&rsquo;re in bed together. She also likes making sure you&rsquo;re okay after sex, and will stroke stray hairs out of your face with the most serious look in her eyes. When you ask her what&rsquo;s wrong, she&rsquo;ll say that the only thing wrong is that she doesn&rsquo;t have as much time with you as she would like. You reassure her that you know how important being a hero is to her and that you are happy as long as she is happy.<br /></li></ul><p><b>J = Jack Off (Masturbation headcanon)</b></p><ul><li>Carol has always been able to find an able and willing partner to get in bed with whenever she has felt the need to get off. Other than that, she rarely ever felt the need to touch herself. Ever since she met you, Carol couldn&rsquo;t help but think about you whenever she felt horny. Only when she actually slept with you did she realize that no fantasy she could have come up with would have come close to how good the real thing felt. She would rather sleep with you than touch herself.<br /></li></ul><p><b>K = Kink (One or more of their kinks)</b></p><ul><li>Carol&rsquo;s biggest kink is when you take control of the situation when you&rsquo;re sleeping together. She has to be in control of things everywhere else (she&rsquo;s Captain Marvel after all), and it feels good to give control over to someone else for a change, even if it&rsquo;s for a little while. It should come as no surprise that dirty talk is something that Carol is very good at, and she is pleasantly surprised that you&rsquo;re as good as she is when it comes to whispering filthy things in each other&rsquo;s ear.<br /></li></ul><p><b>L = Location (Favourite places to do the do)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is very old school when it comes to having sex with you. There is nowhere she would rather be than with you in your bedroom. When she brings you to the SHIELD base, she loves having you in her room all day and seeing you blush as Steve asks what happened to your neck. However, there is nothing like being in the apartment that you live in with her because from the furniture to the decorations on the walls, everything has your touch on it, and she loves that so much.<br /></li></ul><p><b>M = Motivation (What turns them on, gets them going)</b></p><ul><li>When the two of you are training together. Or when she catches you staring at her when she&rsquo;s doing something. Basically, everything that you do turns her on, and she makes no effort to hide how turned on she is. If you happen to be training together, she&rsquo;ll pin you down and make out with you. She loves it when she catches you staring and you blush or pretend you weren&rsquo;t just staring at her.<br /></li></ul><p><b>N = NO (Something they wouldn&rsquo;t do, turn-offs)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn&rsquo;t really like being really rough with you because she&rsquo;s so strong. If she uses all of her strength with you she would pretty much break you in half. So instead of using all of her strength, she&rsquo;ll use just enough to leave marks on your hips. She really likes to spank you when both of you are in the mood for it. However, she doesn&rsquo;t like to really hurt you, so she won&rsquo;t seriously hurt you during sex.<br /></li></ul><p><b>O = Oral (Preference for giving or receiving, skill, etc)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is a giver in all aspects, so she loves eating you out on a regular basis. Every girl is different, and she will take the time to find out what you like. She will take her time kissing down your body and teasing you before getting to the best part of the night. There are nights when she will spend hours going down on you, and she&rsquo;ll only stop when she feels that you can&rsquo;t take any more of her tongue. She&rsquo;ll come back up with that smirk that you have come to know and love, and she will give you a deep kiss to show that she had as much fun as you did.<br /></li><li>Some nights Carol is less of a top than she usually is, and you are able to be the top for once. You&rsquo;re able to take care of Carol like no one else ever has, and she loves that about you. You know exactly what Carol likes, and you use this to your advantage. After eating her out for several rounds, you wink at her cheekily which causes her to get up on top again. She won&rsquo;t ever say this, but she loves it whenever you wrestle your way on top.<br /></li></ul><p><b>P = Pace (Are they fast and rough? Slow and sensual? etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol loves being gentle and soft with you. She has seen enough violence both in the field and while she was in the Air Force, so she wants to be as gentle as she can with you. She wants to take her time making you feel special, and this is shown through deep kisses and gentle touches. However, when she gets jealous, she won&rsquo;t hesitate to leave marks up and down your neck so that everyone can see that you&rsquo;re hers. There is just something about seeing her marks on you that turns Carol on beyond belief.<br /></li></ul><p><b>Q = Quickie (Their opinions on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is definitely the captain of quickies. Although she is somewhat more conservative with where the two of you have sex, she is getting more open to hooking up anywhere. Leaving your legs shaking as she walks away with a smirk makes her day. She knows how to make you want her for the rest of the mission. Carol is horny for you all the time, and she knows you&rsquo;re ready for anything when it comes to her.<br /></li></ul><p><b>R = Risk (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn&rsquo;t like taking risks when it comes to you because she doesn&rsquo;t even want to explore the potential of seeing you hurt. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean she isn&rsquo;t willing to experiment with what&rsquo;s new.<br /></li></ul><p><b>S = Stamina (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last&hellip;)</b></p><ul><li>If there is one thing that Carol is known for, it is her stamina. She can just go for round after round when she&rsquo;s with you. It seems like she can not get tired, and you&rsquo;re certainly not complaining. Whether it be five quick rounds and cuddles, or one long round that lasts the entire night, Carol can make you cum several times any and every night. It doesn&rsquo;t take her long to recover for another round, and she&rsquo;ll be on top of you after only a few minutes. Sometimes, she can be extremely tired and just go for one round, but you&rsquo;re not complaining because you just want to cuddle with her.<br /></li></ul><p><b>T = Toy (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)</b></p><ul><li>Carol doesn&rsquo;t have that much experience with toys, but you do so you teach her what all the toys are used for. Being a quick learner, she gets the hang of things pretty quickly and becomes an expert in using the toys on you. Things like strap-ons and vibrators have become a regular thing that is used whenever the two of you together. She loves having you fall apart under her as she uses these toys on you, and it always makes her feel good whenever you&rsquo;re feeling good.<br /></li></ul><p><b>U = Unfair (how much they like to tease)</b></p><ul><li>There is no one better at teasing than Carol. She will tease you until you&rsquo;re begging for her, and then she&rsquo;ll tease you some more. During missions and such she will be extremely focused on what&rsquo;s ahead, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have fun after everything&rsquo;s over.

Sometimes neither of you can get your hands off each other and will sneak off somewhere &ldquo;private&rdquo; on the ship to do your business, and everyone else on the team will pretend not to notice that you forgot to properly button up your shirt.<br /></li></ul><p><b>V = Volume (How loud they are, what sounds they make)</b></p><ul><li>Carol is not the loudest person that you&rsquo;ve slept with.
