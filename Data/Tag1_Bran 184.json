        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>I don&rsquo;t really see a chance of them &lsquo;winning&rsquo;. We might see that the existence of the WW is more complicated than meets the eye. Showwise they are an experiment of the CotF gone awry and this means they have to be stopped and probably will. </p><p>But as you I&rsquo;m not that invested in the defeat of the WW. I&rsquo;m curious as to <b>how</b> they will be defeated and what kind of sacrifice will be necessary, but I&rsquo;m quite sure that GRRM intended for the other side of fire to be problematic as well (eternal winter against eternal summer, both are no good news). Showwise I think they gave us a hint that the elimination of the Night King might solve the problem. To me it would make sense if they try to remove the dragonglass dagger from his heart and release him to death - which he might even want. I don&rsquo;t think killing him will be as easy as beheading him with a Valyrian sword. Valyrian swords can hurt WW but I doubt the same holds true for the NK. So, they will have to undo whatever it was the CotF did to the Night King. I really hope that Bran will get the most important role in that plot. He is the one with magical abilities. He should be the one to finish the NK. I suppose the weirwood or some other holy place might be important as well for this.</p><p>Bookwise I think balance has to be restored. Which might mean that all the magic of the CotF has to be destroyed and then also the magic from the fire side, because I picture it like some kind of scales : everytime the scales tip too far in one direction the other side grows stronger as well. There was a Long Night before and there was the fire and blood magic of the Valyrians. My hunch is (and I have talked about this with <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a>) that Bloodraven vanished beyond the wall on the search for immortality (because villains always want immortality) and began to orchestrate the revival of magic possibly by tricking the CotF about his real intentions. I strongly suspect that the tragedy of Summerhall where Aegon V died in the attempt to hatch dragons is somehow connected to Bloodraven. At that time the scales were not so far out of balance that dragons could be burn. We see the WW back and strong in the prologue of AGOT and the first episode. So, the scales have been triggered. At the end of the book - framing the events between ice and fire btw - the dragons are born. By then the scales are off.</p><p>So, my idea would be that they will have to eliminate all magic. So my idea is the following - and please note that this is just a hunch, based on my belief that ice and fire are both bad news and that one aspect of bittersweet will be that magic will be gone. In LotR the Elves know that the defeat of Sauron will mean that their magic will vanish as well, although it even is in essential good magic. I think it is a bit more complicated with ASOIAF : ice and fire magic are both bad, or rather very dangerous but it is possible to do good with them - like Jon&rsquo;s resurrection. </p><p>So, I think the solution might be to try to eliminate the magic of both sides simultaneously. For example : Use the dragons to destroy the weirwood as it is there that the magic of the CotF linger, undo the making of the NK to get rid of the wights and then kill the dragons - for example with weirwood arrows and spears collected before the destruction of course. </p><p>I only fear a bit for Jon in that case, because it is quite possible that the end of magic means his death. </p><p>Losing magic even though it has been depicted as dangerous time and again would be somewhat sad, as it is in LotR and might count as 'bittersweet&rsquo;.</p><p>I doubt we&rsquo;ll get an open end like a stalemate or  even the WW winning. What would be the point? GRRM does not write pointless nor is his apparent grit a sign of nihilism. It is all about choices, and the choice to destroy magic to save the world might come down to be very hard indeed.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

Showwise I think they gave us a hint that the elimination of the Night King might solve the problem. To me it would make sense if they try to remove the dragonglass dagger from his heart and release him to death - which he might even want. I don\u2019t think killing him will be as easy as beheading him with a Valyrian sword. Valyrian swords can hurt WW but I doubt the same holds true for the NK. So, they will have to undo whatever it was the CotF did to the Night King. I really hope that Bran will get the most important role in that plot. He is the one with magical abilities. He should be the one to finish the NK. I suppose the weirwood or some other holy place might be important as well for this.</p><p>Bookwise I think balance has to be restored. Which might mean that all the magic of the CotF has to be destroyed and then also the magic from the fire side, because I picture it like some kind of scales : everytime the scales tip too far in one direction the other side grows stronger as well. There was a Long Night before and there was the fire and blood magic of the Valyrians. My hunch is (and I have talked about this with <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a>) that Bloodraven vanished beyond the wall on the search for immortality (because villains always want immortality) and began to orchestrate the revival of magic possibly by tricking the CotF about his real intentions. I strongly suspect that the tragedy of Summerhall where Aegon V died in the attempt to hatch dragons is somehow connected to Bloodraven. At that time the scales were not so far out of balance that dragons could be burn. We see the WW back and strong in the prologue of AGOT and the first episode. So, the scales have been triggered. At the end of the book - framing the events between ice and fire btw - the dragons are born. By then the scales are off.</p><p>So, my idea would be that they will have to eliminate all magic. So my idea is the following - and please note that this is just a hunch, based on my belief that ice and fire are both bad news and that one aspect of bittersweet will be that magic will be gone. In LotR the Elves know that the defeat of Sauron will mean that their magic will vanish as well, although it even is in essential good magic. I think it is a bit more complicated with ASOIAF : ice and fire magic are both bad, or rather very dangerous but it is possible to do good with them - like Jon\u2019s resurrection. </p><p>So, I think the solution might be to try to eliminate the magic of both sides simultaneously. For example : Use the dragons to destroy the weirwood as it is there that the magic of the CotF linger, undo the making of the NK to get rid of the wights and then kill the dragons - for example with weirwood arrows and spears collected before the destruction of course. </p><p>I only fear a bit for Jon in that case, because it is quite possible that the end of magic means his death. </p><p>Losing magic even though it has been depicted as dangerous time and again would be somewhat sad, as it is in LotR and might count as 'bittersweet\u2019.</p><p>I doubt we\u2019ll get an open end like a stalemate or  even the WW winning.

A practiced hunter her aim was accurate\u00a0 as always and it\u00a0 had hit\u00a0 the creature square in its chest . for half moment it seemed to do t noting and her body had sagged in disappointment and fear - but\u00a0 then suddenly the\u00a0 thing\u00a0 exploded\nand seemed\u00a0 to\u00a0 shatter into thousands of tiny shards which spluttered around she and curled around bran protectively to shield his\u00a0 face and her own from the impact of the falling\u00a0 shards.\u00a0 then there\u00a0 was nothing only silence and darkness .</p><p>\u00a0In that quiet\u00a0 moment\u00a0 she let herself breathe and allowed a tiny sliver of pride to get through . they were safe then\u00a0 but not for long. she knew then as she knew know that it would not last\u00a0 . yes, she had \u00a0managed to kill one of those\nthings but how many more were there going to be ? she could not defeat them all on her own.</p><p>Meera had always\u00a0 known the journey\nahead of her was perilous and \u00a0that It potentially could be fatal and she also knew\u00a0 for certain that it was necessary.\u00a0 For\u00a0 all the world was at stake . it was not a task\nshe could run from or pass to someone else . she was needed. they needed her- not\njust Bran and Rickon and hodor\u00a0 osha\u00a0 and\u00a0 Jojen but all the people every where\u00a0 who were still unaware\nof the looming danger which threatened them all.

A practiced hunter her aim was accurate&nbsp; as always and it&nbsp; had hit&nbsp; the creature square in its chest . for half moment it seemed to do t noting and her body had sagged in disappointment and fear - but&nbsp; then suddenly the&nbsp; thing&nbsp; exploded\nand seemed&nbsp; to&nbsp; shatter into thousands of tiny shards which spluttered around she and curled around bran protectively to shield his&nbsp; face and her own from the impact of the falling&nbsp; shards.&nbsp; then there&nbsp; was nothing only silence and darkness .</p><p>&nbsp;In that quiet&nbsp; moment&nbsp; she let herself breathe and allowed a tiny sliver of pride to get through . they were safe then&nbsp; but not for long. she knew then as she knew know that it would not last&nbsp; . yes, she had &nbsp;managed to kill one of those\nthings but how many more were there going to be ? she could not defeat them all on her own.</p><p>Meera had always&nbsp; known the journey\nahead of her was perilous and &nbsp;that It potentially could be fatal and she also knew&nbsp; for certain that it was necessary.&nbsp; For&nbsp; all the world was at stake . it was not a task\nshe could run from or pass to someone else . she was needed. they needed her- not\njust Bran and Rickon and hodor&nbsp; osha&nbsp; and&nbsp; Jojen but all the people every where&nbsp; who were still unaware\nof the looming danger which threatened them all. Meera reed had never backed down from a\nchallenge and she was not about to start&nbsp; .&nbsp;</p><p>They had made a pact ,her and jojen on\nthe way to winterfell that they would do at must be done, whatever the cost . The Reeds already\nknew that day that they would protect Brandon stark with their very lives and they were\nprepared for that . Meera had been prepared to face a great many things on this\njourney but she was not sure heartbreak was one of them . sometimes she could not help herself but let pain over her lost loved ones&nbsp; wash over her as well as&nbsp; frustration that If they could not\nreach their journey&rsquo;s destination then their deaths , their sacrifices would have been in\nvain . she was determined not to let that happen . they could face whatever came their way\ntrying to disrupt&nbsp; the quest and she not let them not any of them not even white walkers .</p><p>. jojen had told her from the beginning that Bran was what mattered he was the key to halting the destruction . she &nbsp;knew that he\nneeded her right now and their need for each other was mutual in the wilderness but\nsometimes she&nbsp; could not help but wonder&nbsp; what would happen&nbsp; when she became less useful , when&nbsp; she was no longer needed . they were friends,&nbsp; weren&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; They were in this together they would stay together surely ,\nshe not be abandoned not when they had come so far and it was thanks to her that they had .</p><p>&nbsp;At\ntimes such as this when such thoughts entered her head unbidden , she missed the happy and bright boy\nbran had been not so very long ago , the lively&nbsp; feisty boy she had first met in Winterfell who knew little yet about the pain life would bring to him . even the boy&nbsp; he was at the&nbsp; start of&nbsp; the\njourney carried on carefully by&nbsp; a gentle giant&nbsp; by a sense&nbsp; optimism&nbsp; that had not yet been quelled&nbsp; still in is face&nbsp; back then was the possibility of hope.&nbsp;</p><p>. she wondered what had become&nbsp; of that boy&nbsp; with mischief in his\neyes and a dimpled boyish smile and she wondered I she would see it again whether they would&nbsp; ever be happy again whether they would ever be sae again . she was cold she as tired and she hurt&nbsp; and not just physically either.&nbsp; Each day got more and more tough and she felt more and useless but she knew that bran was depending on her still and\nshe could let him down she could not give up .she would not give up. He had changed yes but&nbsp; so had she . she&nbsp; would not give up&nbsp; she would not give in to defeat and hopelessness&nbsp;</p><p>Back within the walls of Winterfell &nbsp;almost&nbsp; were the journey stared . she&nbsp; couldn&rsquo;t quite believe that they made it. that had survived this long\nthat they ad not yet succumbed . she felt a sense of deep pride and joy , &nbsp;the horrors seemed a million miles at that moment &nbsp;and &nbsp;she\ncould almost relax almost believe her nightmare was nearing its end at last , almost.&nbsp;</p><p>The last time she had seen this&nbsp; place was&nbsp; when she and Jojen had been together . she missed her brother dearly but she knew he had been right to bring them here . the journey however\nheart-breaking had been &nbsp;necessary Bran ad&nbsp; knew&nbsp; now about his destiny and his great\nresponsibility that e alone must shoulder . se&nbsp; could assist , must assist but she could not bar the\npath to what needed to come to pass. The feeling&nbsp; of unease rose&nbsp; in her&nbsp; gut once again although she wished\nit would not&nbsp; she was still needed&nbsp; she told her herself&nbsp; but or long a voice in her head snarled back&nbsp;<i> how long would&nbsp; it last ?. who was she after all?&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Lady Meera of house Reed &ldquo;Bran says as If reading her&nbsp; morose thoughts and&nbsp; his lips twitched slightly upwards, the very ghost\nof a smirk but still more of a smile than she&rsquo;d seen in so many months . Then their hands clasped&nbsp; and&nbsp; suddenly it was like old times again&hellip;but then the stark girls flanked him&nbsp; either side looking at her up and\ndown and se was&nbsp; suddenly feeling like an outsider once more , an intruder .\nperhaps she should not stay alter all .&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;&nbsp; I guess you don&rsquo;t\nneed me anymore .. &ldquo; she whispered&nbsp; . </p><p>&ldquo; Of course I &nbsp;still\nneed you &ldquo; he breathes &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always needed you Meera. don&rsquo;t go . not after everything &ldquo;</p><p>Meera nodded and tried to remain calm&nbsp; but&nbsp; her heart was bursting. she held him to her chest and he let her.&nbsp; <i>Don&rsquo;t go Don&rsquo;t go Don&rsquo;t go&nbsp;</i> she was needed. she was wanted&nbsp; she would&nbsp; not leave </p><p>&ldquo; Meera killed a white walker &ldquo; bran tells Arya and sansa and\nthey goggle at her &ldquo; by herself . Meera saved my life .more than once&nbsp; &ldquo;</p><p>she smiles but her eyes were tearful &ldquo; I would&rsquo;ve died for you &ldquo; she\nmummers &ldquo;it would&rsquo;ve been worth it &ldquo;&nbsp;bran&nbsp; grabs her hand &ldquo;its my turn to keep you safe &ldquo; He tells her . &nbsp;she perhaps should have bristled &nbsp;at that but she did not . it felt nice the thought\nof her being looked after for a change&nbsp; it felt comforting&nbsp; . &ldquo; whatever happens &ldquo;he said &ldquo; whatever comes to pass ,whatever becomes of this world know this . I am still\nBrandon stark inside and I always will be, - and Brandon stark loves you and he always has.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>",
