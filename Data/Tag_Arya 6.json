You are a little shit and don\u2019t care about your teammates, you only care about your own grade.</p><p><b>Theon:</b> you feel guilty because you convinced your friend to skip a lot of classes and now they need an A+ to pass. You try to make it up to them even if that means failing yourself. </p><p><b>Beric:</b> when one of your classmates freezes and forgets what they were supposed to say during the presentation you step forward and save them. Not all heros wear capes.</p><p><b>Tormund:</b> you crack inappropiate jokes mid-work and distract everyone, also you smuggle alcohol into the team gatherings. No one things you will pass but during the presentation you are one of the best.</p><p><b>Gendry:</b> when they asked you to be part of the team you had no idea what you were getting yourself into but you accepted anyway. You are a good element and get rewarded for your help.</p><p><b>Brienne:</b> you had a plan of what the team was supposed to do but you end up feeling overwhelmed because you underestimated how much work you had to do. Still you get an A for effort.</p><p><b>Jaime:</b> the good-hearted jock. You chose to split from your bestie because you want a good grade to get into a nice college. However, after you pass you go back to your old ways.</p><p><b>Podrick:</b> you didn\u2019t know shit about your team\u2019s topic but somehow learned everything five minutes before the presentation. Everyone likes you because you are hard working.</p><p><b>Jorah:</b> you are loyal to your friends and if you fail at least you will fail together. It sucks because you are a good student and you almost passed but you got distracted for a second.</p><p><b>Lyanna:</b> you are a new student and you don\u2019t know as much as your teammates but you do something amazing at the presentation and impress the teacher. </p><p><b>Melisandre:</b> you spend most team gatherings talking shit and getting everyone into trouble but you had one brilliant idea that is crutial to the team\u2019s success. You are a good motivator and you change schools a lot.</p><p><b>Ghost:</b> you are a very important part of the team but for some reason no one seems to notice it and they never congratulate you. However you still get the work done and never fail.</p><p><b>The Night King:</b> overconfident, you brag about being the teacher\u2019s favorite and you don\u2019t prepare for the presentation.

Suffice to say that I did some digging of my own and what I found was indeed a pleasant surprise. </p><p>We know that Grrm took inspiration for Arya&rsquo;s name from Sanskrit and as a language that was once spoken in ancient India, it&rsquo;s not surprising that it would be connected to the religion of Hinduism (in this context with the names of the Gods and Goddesses of the religion). So while I was looking into it, I came across a post about the hindu goddess Durga. Now in my culture this Goddess is believed to be the supreme Mother who in turn is the manifestation of <i>Shakti (</i>the power which drives the universe). She is also said to have a total of 108 names or avatars and yes, one of her names is <b><i>Aarya</i></b>. Aarya is that avatar of the Goddess who takes the form of the warrior. She is also worshipped as the goddess of harvest and as the protectress of women.</p><p>In my opinion Arya of asoiaf symbolizes various aspects of the Hindu Goddess. Granted that I have a pet peeve against calling Arya a warrior but it is so much more than that.
