He smiled at the shocked faces and sat himself practically on top of Tony. </p><p>He didn\u2019t quite know what it meant to be a Slytherin, but he figured it\u2019ll be fascinating enough. <br/></p><hr><p><i>Coffee Shop AU </i></p><p>Pepper was really getting tired of playing matchmaker for Tony and Rhodey. Well, more accurately, she was tired of fielding all of their suitors that showed up at the shop. </p><p>She ran a little hole in the wall cafe, and Tony would come to help out sometimes. He\u2019d managed to rope one of his college friends, James \u201cRhodey\u201d Rhodes, into helping out as well. Their combined charisma and genuine love for everyone had earned them a fan club of sorts. </p><p>There was Steve Rogers, art student at the local community college. He was polite and kind, which made up for being as large as a bus. Sometimes he brought with him Bucky Barnes.</p><p>From what Pepper understood, he was a war vet. </p><p>\u201cHe told me he served in Afghanistan. I think he left a piece of himself there too.\u201d Rhodey would give him something extra and talk to him, and Steve would look at him with stars in his eyes. </p><p>He would look like Rhodey hung the moon every time Bucky would talk back. </p><p>Eventually Steve started showing up with another young man, Sam Wilson, and Pepper thought she might have found someone that could out-flirt Tony. </p><p>He almost did once, but then Rhodey shuffled in and called them \u2018really pretty\u2019 and they both stuttered after him for at least five minutes. </p><p>Then there was Natasha Romanoff and her crew. Pepper still couldn&rsquo;t figure out whether or not Natasha wanted to date both Tony and Rhodey or adopt them, but she was the only one that Pepper would maybe want to steal as her own. </p><p>She refused to embarrass herself and tell that to the boys, though. </p><p>Natasha often brought Clint around with her. When Tony found out he was deaf, he spent an entire day teaching himself ASL. Natasha nodded to herself and Pepper contemplated, not for the first time, that they were doing this on purpose.</p><p>The next time she visited she brought a man named Bruce Banner and practically threw him at Tony. </p><p>\u201cTell them to work their magic, Clint hasn&rsquo;t slept this well in years.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t have to tell them, that&rsquo;s just their personality.\u201d</p><p>Bruce was less tense within the hour. Pepper heard Natasha calling a Matt Murdock and asking him to come around. </p><p>At this rate, Pepper was going to have to make a list. <br/></p><hr><p><i>\u201cWe share an office but we have different shifts\u201d</i></p><p>Tony worked the graveyard shift at any job he had, it was just custom. He was too used to sleeping during the day not to. He didn&rsquo;t mind it much. </p><p>He minded it even less when got to see Mr. Barnes, the person who worked the shift before his. He was his name on the schedule hanging on the wall, but seeing his name and seeing his face were two different things. </p><p>He was hot. But more than that, he was hot and nice. He was polite whenever he saw Tony, would gladly help Tony whenever he asked. </p><p>Tony had a type, and that was it. </p><p>So maybe he left flowers at the office and maybe he offered to help more than he usually did, but it wasn\u2019t like it was a crime to be nice to someone. He didn\u2019t expect anything to really come of it, but it was a welcome surprise when it did. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the guy that\u2019s been leaving flowers everywhere. Ever tried just asking for a number?\u201d Tony turned around. </p><p>\u201cAre you offering it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d </p><p>Tony smiled brightly, and the rest was history. <br/></p><hr><p><i>Stony: Promposal </i></p><p>\u201cTones, if you don\u2019t get your boyfriend to stop asking me about how he should ask you to prom, I will tell him to make a sign that says, \u2018Can I eat your ass at prom?\u2019.\u201d Rhodey\u2019s voice was teasing, but Tony knew that if he didn\u2019t take him seriously he would do it. That\u2019s how Tiberius Stone ended up covered in chicken feathers and glue after the break-up. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to tell him? I\u2019ve already let him know that he doesn\u2019t need to do a huge proposal thing, and he\u2019s still trying.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou do one first.\u201d Tony turned his head to Rhodey, and ran a couple of plans through his mind. </p><p>\u201cYou know what, you are absolutely right.\u201d Tony pulled his computer towards him and Rhodey rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u201cIf you start asking me, too, I will kill the both of you.\u201d Tony flapped his hands dismissively at him and Rhodey knew it was going to be a long week. </p><p>Tony had figured out what he wanted to do pretty quickly. It was just getting him to do it that was the problem. </p><p>\u201cTony, you know he isn\u2019t going to say no.\u201d Tony was pacing around Rhodey\u2019s house, like a miniature storm cloud. </p><p>\u201cBut what if i say it wrong?\u201d He said back. RHodey raised his eyebrows before pulling out his phone. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Natasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s promposal was, although not extravagant, was sweet and short. There was a lot of applause anyways, as Tony and Steve were the star couple of the school. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou two are cute.\u201d</p><p>Tony and Steve started asking about what they should wear for prom, and Rhodey was really thinking about taking that back. <br/></p><hr><p><i>\u201cI hate you but sadly my dog likes you\u201d </i></p><p>Clint swore his dog, he named her Lucky but she obviously was <i>not</i>, came out of a trash can. She always managed to track dirt everywhere, even if he just washed her, and had managed to open his refrigerator and steal his pizza. </p><p>If he wasn\u2019t so upset he would be impressed. But alas, stolen food. </p><p>She also loved his asshole neighbor. </p><p>His neighbor was either a mad scientist or a supervillain and either way, he was loud. \u00a0Clint could hear banging at two am five days out of seven. He wasn\u2019t asleep at that time anyways, infomercials were god, but it was the principle of the thing. </p><p>The one time he introduced himself to Clint he said his name was Tony, and that was the only interaction Cint wanted to have with him. Lucky thought differently. </p><p>She would repeatedly yowl like at cat at his door until Clint let her out, then run next door and bark at Tony&rsquo;s door until Tony let her in. </p><p>Clint didn&rsquo;t find it adorable when his face lit up at the sight of her. He didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>Because of Lucky - it was absolutely not on his own terms, damn you - he learned a lot about Tony. \u00a0He learned that Tony drank his coffee black but had a sweet tooth the size of a mountain. He learned that Tony was Italian but hated pizza, he would buy it just for Lucky, though. He learned that Tony didn\u2019t have many friends, and the ones he did have were far away. </p><p>\u201cI hate the loneliness, you know?\u201d He had said. </p><p>Clint learned maybe he didn\u2019t hate his neighbor as much as he claimed. He\u2019d blame Lucky if anyone asked why he\u2019d practically moved in. \u00a0</p>",

He was too used to sleeping during the day not to. He didn\u2019t mind it much. </p><p>He minded it even less when got to see Mr. Barnes, the person who worked the shift before his. He was his name on the schedule hanging on the wall, but seeing his name and seeing his face were two different things. </p><p>He was hot. But more than that, he was hot and nice. He was polite whenever he saw Tony, would gladly help Tony whenever he asked. </p><p>Tony had a type, and that was it. </p><p>So maybe he left flowers at the office and maybe he offered to help more than he usually did, but it wasn\u2019t like it was a crime to be nice to someone. He didn\u2019t expect anything to really come of it, but it was a welcome surprise when it did. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the guy that\u2019s been leaving flowers everywhere. Ever tried just asking for a number?\u201d Tony turned around. </p><p>\u201cAre you offering it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d </p><p>Tony smiled brightly, and the rest was history. <br></p><hr><p><i>Stony: Promposal </i></p><p>\u201cTones, if you don\u2019t get your boyfriend to stop asking me about how he should ask you to prom, I will tell him to make a sign that says, \u2018Can I eat your ass at prom?\u2019.\u201d Rhodey\u2019s voice was teasing, but Tony knew that if he didn\u2019t take him seriously he would do it. That\u2019s how Tiberius Stone ended up covered in chicken feathers and glue after the break-up. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to tell him? I\u2019ve already let him know that he doesn\u2019t need to do a huge proposal thing, and he\u2019s still trying.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou do one first.\u201d Tony turned his head to Rhodey, and ran a couple of plans through his mind. </p><p>\u201cYou know what, you are absolutely right.\u201d Tony pulled his computer towards him and Rhodey rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u201cIf you start asking me, too, I will kill the both of you.\u201d Tony flapped his hands dismissively at him and Rhodey knew it was going to be a long week. </p><p>Tony had figured out what he wanted to do pretty quickly. It was just getting him to do it that was the problem. </p><p>\u201cTony, you know he isn\u2019t going to say no.\u201d Tony was pacing around Rhodey\u2019s house, like a miniature storm cloud. </p><p>\u201cBut what if i say it wrong?\u201d He said back. RHodey raised his eyebrows before pulling out his phone. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Natasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s promposal was, although not extravagant, was sweet and short.

But alas, stolen food. </p><p>She also loved his asshole neighbor. </p><p>His neighbor was either a mad scientist or a supervillain and either way, he was loud. \u00a0Clint could hear banging at two am five days out of seven.

He didn\u2019t. </p><p>Because of Lucky - it was absolutely not on his own terms, damn you - he learned a lot about Tony. \u00a0He learned that Tony drank his coffee black but had a sweet tooth the size of a mountain. He learned that Tony was Italian but hated pizza, he would buy it just for Lucky, though. He learned that Tony didn\u2019t have many friends, and the ones he did have were far away. </p><p>\u201cI hate the loneliness, you know?\u201d He had said. </p><p>Clint learned maybe he didn\u2019t hate his neighbor as much as he claimed.

The look on Tony&rsquo;s face was terrified, and the look on the Slytherins face was something akin to possessiveness and James wasn&rsquo;t about to let Tony go it alone. </p><p>If Tony Stark was going to be sent to Slytherin, so was he. </p><p>He stepped up the dias with a calm stride and a straight face, nothing belying the anger pumping in his veins. The sorting hat flopped over his head and the rest of the world disappeared. </p><p>&ldquo;Send me to Slytherin.&rdquo; He said, voice low and calm, perfected after years of dealing with younger siblings. The hat stilled on his head. </p><p>&ldquo;And why should i do that?&rdquo; The hat asked back, contemplative. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a goal and I intend to achieve it, even if that means being a Slytherin.&rdquo; He heard something like a laugh and tensed, preparing to argue. </p><p>&ldquo;I do believe these next few years will be very, <i>very</i>, interesting.&rdquo; The hat roared Slytherin again and James took of the hat. He smiled at the shocked faces and sat himself practically on top of Tony. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t quite know what it meant to be a Slytherin, but he figured it&rsquo;ll be fascinating enough. <br /></p><hr /><p><i>Coffee Shop AU </i></p><p>Pepper was really getting tired of playing matchmaker for Tony and Rhodey. Well, more accurately, she was tired of fielding all of their suitors that showed up at the shop. </p><p>She ran a little hole in the wall cafe, and Tony would come to help out sometimes. He&rsquo;d managed to rope one of his college friends, James &ldquo;Rhodey&rdquo; Rhodes, into helping out as well. Their combined charisma and genuine love for everyone had earned them a fan club of sorts. </p><p>There was Steve Rogers, art student at the local community college.
