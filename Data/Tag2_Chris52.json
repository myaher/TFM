Although feeling slightly unwell, you couldn\u2019t help but giggle. One the one hand, due to his beard tickling your face, on the other, because you always felt like a teenager in love for the first time when Chris was around.</p><p>You felt him smiling against the skin on your neck.\u00a0\u201cMorning, love,\u201d, he mumbled into the crook of your neck, burrying his head there afterwards. This grown ass man and the weight that came with that well trained body of his was squishing you under its weight.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cChris!\u201d, you squealed.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d, you brought out before you gathered your whole strength and pushed him off of you. He let you push him off and rolled to your side. In a play fight he took seriously, you would never have the chance to defeat him.</p><p>Chris lay on his side, his head on one of his strong hands, grinning at you, not saying a word.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d, you smiled, hitting him playfully.\u00a0\u201cI love you,\u201d, he smiled. Your eyes practically lit up with joy as you grinned at his statement.</p><p>Chris and you had only been dating for a good four months, but the both of you had been openly talking about your feelings from the beginning. You had been falling for him since the first time you had met and Chris had felt the exact same thing. Those two facts contributed to you telling each other the bis three words pretty quickly.</p><p>But your relationship developing more quickly than others in no way meant that you were rushing into this relationship. All your feelings, and everything you did was genuine and the both of you were as happy as you had ever been.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d, you smile, leaning down to him and kissing his lips gently. You pulled away after a short kiss and Chris immediately pouted at the lack of affection.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Chris. We have a lot to do before your family arrives,\u201d, you stated, taking his hand and attempted to pull him out of the bed. With one short tug, he had you falling into the bed and right into his arms again.\u00a0\u201cI believe we have time for something else before we prepare anything, don\u2019t we, love?\u201d, he smirked.</p><ul><li>\n</li></ul><p>Four hours later, Chris and you were in the kitchen, cooking for eleven people, including Chris\u2019 parents, his brother, his two sisters and the kids and husband of his sister.</p><p>\u201cWe would have had a lot more tim if you had let me get out of bed, you know?\u201d, you said, half playfully, half seriously. You head turned in his direction when you heard a playful scoff. The smile on your lips vanished as your gaze fell upon the clock.\u00a0\u201cOh god, your family\u2019s supposed to be here in half an hour and I\u2019m not even dressed!\u201d, you called out.</p><p>Panic rose up into your chest and your breathing picked up quite a bit. You wanted to leave a good impression on Chris\u2019 family and now you would look like you\u2019ve just come out of bed. Chris immediately noticed your worries and came up to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDarling, hey, love, look at me,\u201d, he calmly said, taking your hands into his, rubing circles on your skin. Your gaze found his and you immediately relaxed a little.\u00a0\u201cthey\u2019re going to love you no matter how you look,\u201d, he stated, kissing your forehead softly.\u00a0\u201cbut, you can go dress, I got this,\u201d, he prposed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s sweet of you, but the fact that we\u2019re late is my fault as much as it is yours,\u201d, you responded. He shook his head, chuckling lowly.\u00a0\u201cY/N, I\u2019m serious, I\u2019ve got this. I know how important this is to you, so go ahead and dress and do your make-up just as you planned to do. We\u2019ve got this,\u201d, he said, one of his hands cupping your cheek.\u00a0\u201cRight, Dodger?\u201d, he called out for his dog.\u00a0</p><p>The both of you looked to your left, where Dodger was expectingly waiting for something. You chuckled and looked back at Chris.\u00a0\u201cYou serious?\u201d, you mumbled. He nodded calmly and smiled at you.\u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll hurry,\u201d, you promised. Chris laughed.\u00a0\u201cYeah sure you will,\u201d, he smiled.\u00a0\u201cI love you,\u201d, you whispered before giving his lips a peck and running upstairs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you too!\u201d, Chris called after you.\u00a0</p><ul><li>\n</li></ul><p>Fifteen minutes later, you hurried downstairs again, and were met with Chris giving the food one last touch. You were impressed. You wrapped your arms around him from behind and placed a kiss on his back.\u00a0\u201cThis good looking and a cook? Husband material,\u201d, you joked, which made him laugh. He turned in your hug and wrapped his arms around you once you faced each other.</p><p>His eyes went up and down your outfit as much as they could in this position.\u00a0\u201cYou look gorgeous,\u201d, he complimented you and you grinned up at him in response.\u00a0\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn, Evans. Go get changed while I watch the food,\u201d, you demanded.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, you had to help this giant baby pick out what he was going to wear. Once he was fully dressed, you already heard the door bell ring. You looked at your boyfriend in utter horror.\u00a0\u201cOh god, oh god, oh god. I\u2019m gonna die, I\u2019m gonna-\u201d, you started rambling, but Chris interrupted you.\u00a0\u201cDarling,\u201d, he said, getting your attention.\u00a0</p><p>He leaned in, kissing you passionately and making the thoughts in your head dissolve into nothingness. He had that kind of affect on you. And he knew it damn well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, allright?\u201d, he asked after softly pulling away. You got so lost in the blue of his eyes and the calmness of his words that you could only nod.\u00a0\u201cAll right,\u201d, Chris said, taking your hand in his and then walking down the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>Chris opened the door and in came his whole family. They all greeted him lovingly before introducing themselves to you and hugging you sweetly. You were slowly calming down once everyone was inside and everyone was seated in Chris\u2019 livingroom.\u00a0</p><p>After eating together, you were much more calm and you began to love his family. Currently, you sat next to Carly, one of Chris\u2019 sisters. The both of you each had a wine glass in your hands as you talked. You watched Chris play with his niece and nephews as you talked.\u00a0</p><p>Carly soon followed your gaze and grinned knowingly.\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re really head over heels, huh?\u201d, she asked, grinning. You were sightly taken aback by the question but smiled nontheless.\u00a0\u201cYeah, you could say that,\u201d, you asnwered as you gaze yet again drifted to your boyfriend.</p><p>Chris soon felt your gaze on him and looked up. Your gazes met and you looked at each other lovingly before he was tackled to the ground by one of his nephews.\u00a0</p><p>You giggled quietly and turned to Carly again. She had watched the whole scenario as well.\u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d, she began.\u00a0\u201cI obviously know Chris all his life,\u201d, she continued.\u00a0\u201cAnd he never once looked at someone the way he looks at you.\u201d, she stated.</p><p>Your eyes involuntary widened at her statement.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d, you gulped. Your gaze fell on your boyfriend again, laughing with the kids. Of course, you were hoping your relationship was going to last, but you didn\u2019t expect to much. After all, he could practically date every girl that walked upon this earth.</p><p>Chris\u2019 sister nodded while taking a sip of her drink.\u00a0\u201cAre you sure about that? I mean-\u201d, you started, but she interrupted your thoughts.\u00a0\u201cSweetheart, believe me. I\u2019m pretty sure you won\u2019t be able to get rid of this one anymore.\u201d, she added. You thought about her statement as you watched Chris and it soon accured to you, that you didn\u2019t want to get rid of him, at all.</p><ul><li>\n</li></ul><p>Around nine in the evening, Chris\u2019 family had left, leaving only the two of you and Dodger. Chris wrapped his arms around you from behind and lay his head on your shoulder, kissing your neck softly.\u00a0\u201cSee?\u201d, he mumbled.\u00a0\u201cWasn\u2019t so bad after all, was it?\u201d, he asked. You shook your head and closed your eyes, trying to relax in Chris\u2019 embrace.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you so nervous about this, anyway?\u201d, he asked. You turned in his grasp and looked up at him. And he had that look, that look that told you you could tell him anything. The look that had told you you two belonges together from the beginning.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I know how much your family means to you. And I didn\u2019t wanna screw things up with them because..\u201d, you hesitated, your gaze drifted to your hands around his neck before meeting his gaze again.\u00a0\u201cBecause I don\u2019t wanna let go of you, Evans. Ever.\u201d, you admitted. His eyes lit up at your statement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow convenient,\u201d, he said, leaning down to you, foreheads pressed against each other.\u00a0\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m not planning on letting you go, either,\u201d, he said, making your heart do a flip. You grinned up at him before pulling him down into a kiss.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAlso,\u201d, he said, pulling away from the kiss.\u00a0\u201cI want one.\u201d, he demanded. You looked at him in confusion.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d, you chuckled.\u00a0\u201cA kid.\u201d, he said.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d, you asked, laughing lightly.\u00a0\u201cWell, if we\u2019re planning on getting married then we might as well plan on being parents.\u201d, he explained.<br/></p><p>A weird, warm feeling suddenly spread through your body as your boyfriend told you his future plans, which included you. You didn\u2019t think you had ever been this happy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go try for one, shall we?\u201d, you giggled, leading him upstairs.<br/></p>",

Your eyes practically lit up with joy as you grinned at his statement.</p><p>Chris and you had only been dating for a good four months, but the both of you had been openly talking about your feelings from the beginning. You had been falling for him since the first time you had met and Chris had felt the exact same thing. Those two facts contributed to you telling each other the bis three words pretty quickly.</p><p>But your relationship developing more quickly than others in no way meant that you were rushing into this relationship.

Although feeling slightly unwell, you couldn\u2019t help but giggle. One the one hand, due to his beard tickling your face, on the other, because you always felt like a teenager in love for the first time when Chris was around.</p><p>You felt him smiling against the skin on your neck.\u00a0\u201cMorning, love,\u201d, he mumbled into the crook of your neck, burrying his head there afterwards. This grown ass man and the weight that came with that well trained body of his was squishing you under its weight.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cChris!\u201d, you squealed.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d, you brought out before you gathered your whole strength and pushed him off of you. He let you push him off and rolled to your side. In a play fight he took seriously, you would never have the chance to defeat him.</p><p>Chris lay on his side, his head on one of his strong hands, grinning at you, not saying a word.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d, you smiled, hitting him playfully.\u00a0\u201cI love you,\u201d, he smiled. Your eyes practically lit up with joy as you grinned at his statement.</p><p>Chris and you had only been dating for a good four months, but the both of you had been openly talking about your feelings from the beginning. You had been falling for him since the first time you had met and Chris had felt the exact same thing. Those two facts contributed to you telling each other the bis three words pretty quickly.</p><p>But your relationship developing more quickly than others in no way meant that you were rushing into this relationship. All your feelings, and everything you did was genuine and the both of you were as happy as you had ever been.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d, you smile, leaning down to him and kissing his lips gently. You pulled away after a short kiss and Chris immediately pouted at the lack of affection.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Chris. We have a lot to do before your family arrives,\u201d, you stated, taking his hand and attempted to pull him out of the bed. With one short tug, he had you falling into the bed and right into his arms again.\u00a0\u201cI believe we have time for something else before we prepare anything, don\u2019t we, love?\u201d, he smirked.</p><ul><li>\n</li></ul><p>Four hours later, Chris and you were in the kitchen, cooking for eleven people, including Chris\u2019 parents, his brother, his two sisters and the kids and husband of his sister.</p><p>\u201cWe would have had a lot more tim if you had let me get out of bed, you know?\u201d, you said, half playfully, half seriously. You head turned in his direction when you heard a playful scoff. The smile on your lips vanished as your gaze fell upon the clock.\u00a0\u201cOh god, your family\u2019s supposed to be here in half an hour and I\u2019m not even dressed!\u201d, you called out.</p><p>Panic rose up into your chest and your breathing picked up quite a bit. You wanted to leave a good impression on Chris\u2019 family and now you would look like you\u2019ve just come out of bed. Chris immediately noticed your worries and came up to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDarling, hey, love, look at me,\u201d, he calmly said, taking your hands into his, rubing circles on your skin. Your gaze found his and you immediately relaxed a little.\u00a0\u201cthey\u2019re going to love you no matter how you look,\u201d, he stated, kissing your forehead softly.\u00a0\u201cbut, you can go dress, I got this,\u201d, he prposed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s sweet of you, but the fact that we\u2019re late is my fault as much as it is yours,\u201d, you responded. He shook his head, chuckling lowly.\u00a0\u201cY/N, I\u2019m serious, I\u2019ve got this. I know how important this is to you, so go ahead and dress and do your make-up just as you planned to do. We\u2019ve got this,\u201d, he said, one of his hands cupping your cheek.\u00a0\u201cRight, Dodger?\u201d, he called out for his dog.\u00a0</p><p>The both of you looked to your left, where Dodger was expectingly waiting for something. You chuckled and looked back at Chris.\u00a0\u201cYou serious?\u201d, you mumbled. He nodded calmly and smiled at you.\u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll hurry,\u201d, you promised. Chris laughed.\u00a0\u201cYeah sure you will,\u201d, he smiled.\u00a0\u201cI love you,\u201d, you whispered before giving his lips a peck and running upstairs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you too!\u201d, Chris called after you.\u00a0</p><ul><li>\n</li></ul><p>Fifteen minutes later, you hurried downstairs again, and were met with Chris giving the food one last touch. You were impressed. You wrapped your arms around him from behind and placed a kiss on his back.\u00a0\u201cThis good looking and a cook? Husband material,\u201d, you joked, which made him laugh. He turned in your hug and wrapped his arms around you once you faced each other.</p><p>His eyes went up and down your outfit as much as they could in this position.\u00a0\u201cYou look gorgeous,\u201d, he complimented you and you grinned up at him in response.\u00a0\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn, Evans. Go get changed while I watch the food,\u201d, you demanded.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, you had to help this giant baby pick out what he was going to wear. Once he was fully dressed, you already heard the door bell ring. You looked at your boyfriend in utter horror.\u00a0\u201cOh god, oh god, oh god. I\u2019m gonna die, I\u2019m gonna-\u201d, you started rambling, but Chris interrupted you.\u00a0\u201cDarling,\u201d, he said, getting your attention.\u00a0</p><p>He leaned in, kissing you passionately and making the thoughts in your head dissolve into nothingness. He had that kind of affect on you. And he knew it damn well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, allright?\u201d, he asked after softly pulling away. You got so lost in the blue of his eyes and the calmness of his words that you could only nod.\u00a0\u201cAll right,\u201d, Chris said, taking your hand in his and then walking down the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>Chris opened the door and in came his whole family. They all greeted him lovingly before introducing themselves to you and hugging you sweetly. You were slowly calming down once everyone was inside and everyone was seated in Chris\u2019 livingroom.\u00a0</p><p>After eating together, you were much more calm and you began to love his family. Currently, you sat next to Carly, one of Chris\u2019 sisters. The both of you each had a wine glass in your hands as you talked. You watched Chris play with his niece and nephews as you talked.\u00a0</p><p>Carly soon followed your gaze and grinned knowingly.\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re really head over heels, huh?\u201d, she asked, grinning. You were sightly taken aback by the question but smiled nontheless.\u00a0\u201cYeah, you could say that,\u201d, you asnwered as you gaze yet again drifted to your boyfriend.</p><p>Chris soon felt your gaze on him and looked up. Your gazes met and you looked at each other lovingly before he was tackled to the ground by one of his nephews.\u00a0</p><p>You giggled quietly and turned to Carly again. She had watched the whole scenario as well.\u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d, she began.\u00a0\u201cI obviously know Chris all his life,\u201d, she continued.\u00a0\u201cAnd he never once looked at someone the way he looks at you.\u201d, she stated.</p><p>Your eyes involuntary widened at her statement.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d, you gulped. Your gaze fell on your boyfriend again, laughing with the kids. Of course, you were hoping your relationship was going to last, but you didn\u2019t expect to much. After all, he could practically date every girl that walked upon this earth.</p><p>Chris\u2019 sister nodded while taking a sip of her drink.\u00a0\u201cAre you sure about that? I mean-\u201d, you started, but she interrupted your thoughts.\u00a0\u201cSweetheart, believe me. I\u2019m pretty sure you won\u2019t be able to get rid of this one anymore.\u201d, she added. You thought about her statement as you watched Chris and it soon accured to you, that you didn\u2019t want to get rid of him, at all.</p><ul><li>\n</li></ul><p>Around nine in the evening, Chris\u2019 family had left, leaving only the two of you and Dodger. Chris wrapped his arms around you from behind and lay his head on your shoulder, kissing your neck softly.\u00a0\u201cSee?\u201d, he mumbled.\u00a0\u201cWasn\u2019t so bad after all, was it?\u201d, he asked. You shook your head and closed your eyes, trying to relax in Chris\u2019 embrace.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you so nervous about this, anyway?\u201d, he asked. You turned in his grasp and looked up at him. And he had that look, that look that told you you could tell him anything. The look that had told you you two belonges together from the beginning.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I know how much your family means to you. And I didn\u2019t wanna screw things up with them because..\u201d, you hesitated, your gaze drifted to your hands around his neck before meeting his gaze again.\u00a0\u201cBecause I don\u2019t wanna let go of you, Evans. Ever.\u201d, you admitted. His eyes lit up at your statement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow convenient,\u201d, he said, leaning down to you, foreheads pressed against each other.\u00a0\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m not planning on letting you go, either,\u201d, he said, making your heart do a flip. You grinned up at him before pulling him down into a kiss.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlso,\u201d, he said, pulling away from the kiss.\u00a0\u201cI want one.\u201d, he demanded. You looked at him in confusion.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d, you chuckled.\u00a0\u201cA kid.\u201d, he said.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d, you asked, laughing lightly.\u00a0\u201cWell, if we\u2019re planning on getting married then we might as well plan on being parents.\u201d, he explained.<br></p><p>A weird, warm feeling suddenly spread through your body as your boyfriend told you his future plans, which included you. You didn\u2019t think you had ever been this happy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go try for one, shall we?\u201d, you giggled, leading him upstairs.<br></p>",

You had to admit that the dress was nice. It was a periwinkle blue, one-shoulder, floor-length, tulle gown. You did love how good it looked on you, the color and cut were both very flattering. You did a small spin and it flared out a bit. You couldn\u2019t help but smile. Behind you heard a chuckle.</p><p>You turned and saw Chris standing in the bathroom doorway looking at you. \u201cI did say you looked fine.\u201d</p><p>He was still laughing as he walked towards you. You looked back in the mirror, this time making sure your hair looked good.</p><p>He walked up behind you. \u201cYou know what? I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? About what?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine.\u201d You frowned slightly at his reflection behind you in the mirror, he was smiling still. \u201cYou look better than fine, you look amazing.\u201d</p><p>You laughed and he wrapped his arms around your waist, kissing your exposed shoulder. </p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHow did I get so lucky?\u201d</p><p>You leaned back into his embrace \u201cI ask myself the same question.\u201d</p><p>Bending his head, he kissed your temple before letting you go. You turned to look at him as he reached for his watch and put it on.<i> How did I get so lucky? </i>You wondered to yourself. You and Chris had been together for a little over a year and you had never been happier. Tonight\u2019s gala was the first public event you were going to together as a couple. You were nervous, you had to admit, but excited also. </p><p>He held out his arms, giving you the full effect of his outfit. \u201cSo, how do I look?\u201d</p><p>You stood back to admire what was before you. He had on a dark blue tux jacket, with black pants and shoes. He looked good like always and you felt yourself inflate with pride at the thought of walking in on his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, as always, sweetie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAs always?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cEven when I wake up in the morning and my hair is all over the place and I have morning breath?\u201d</p><p>You giggled. \u201cYes, especially then.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Especially then\u2019?\u201d He walked over and kissed you on your forehead. \u201cBabe, I\u2019m gonna have to get you glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Evans. You look good and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He said sarcastically. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>You grabbed your clutch. \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm and led you to the door.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Once you got to the gala you started to relax, the nervousness you felt earlier had disappeared. You had to admit you were enjoying yourself. You met a few new people and they had all seem genuinely nice, which took you a little by surprise; you had expected them to be snobby and rude. You did catch one or two sidelong glances at you, when you walked in on Chris\u2019s arm, but they were put out of your mind when Chris put an arm around your waist and pulled you close to his side. You put them out of your mind and decided to enjoy yourself.</p><p>After a few drinks, Chris had convinced you to dance through a couple of songs with him. You couldn\u2019t help but laugh through them and Chris was happy that you were enjoying yourself. When you two had finished dancing, Chris led you over to meet some more people he knew, but you soon had to excuse yourself. Those drinks you had had gone through you and you needed the little girls\u2019 room.</p><p>You slipped in and once you relieved yourself, you came out to wash your hands. You heard one of the stalls behind you open and someone joined you at the sink. You smiled over at the dark haired woman in the mirror. She gave you a thin smile back, then she spoke.</p><p>\u201cHi, you\u2019re Y/N, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. Er, do I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, have I?\u201d You turned to look the woman full in the face and with a shock you realized who she was.</p><p>You were faced to face with Chris\u2019s ex Jenny. You weren\u2019t wholly surprised to see her there, after all there were quite a few celebrities; but you hadn\u2019t expected to run into his ex, especially not alone and in the bathroom of all places.</p><p>Giving a smile at your shocked face, Jenny turned back to the mirror. \u201cSo, you and Chris, huh? How long has that been going on?\u201d</p><p>You were still a bit in shock, but catching yourself, you cleared your throat and finally answered. \u201cUm, just a little over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s just now taking you out in public?\u201d She turned to the mirror with a smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, well, we - we just wanted to keep a low profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Low profile,\u2019 that\u2019s interesting.\u201d She said taking out her lipstick and touching it up.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She replaced the cap on it and put it back into her purse before turning to you. \u201cWell, and this is just me, but if I were dating a guy for over a year, and he hadn\u2019t taken me out in public yet, I\u2019d be kinda suspicious.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBut that\u2019s just me. I mean when he and I were together, people knew.\u201d</p><p>You started to get defensive. Straightening your shoulders and sticking your chin out defiantly you told her \u201cWell, people know now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a year later. \u00a0But if you\u2019re proud&hellip; okay then.\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t have a comeback and once she realized that, she gave you a smile and pushed past you out of the bathroom.</p><p>You turned back to the mirror and stared at your reflection. You hadn\u2019t really thought about it before, but now you were a little concerned. Why had Chris waited a year to show you to everyone? Was he embarrassed by you? Nah, he couldn\u2019t be right? You were here now. \u00a0So that had to mean something,<i> right</i>? You stood there trying to convince yourself that everything was okay. </p><p><i>There\u2019s no need to worry,</i> you said to yourself. She was just trying to get in your head. </p><p>You nodded to yourself, and, taking a deep breath you steadied yourself and walked out with your head held high, determined not to show that you had been upset. Looking around for Chris, you soon spotted him about halfway across the floor. He had his right hand over his chest, head thrown back, laughing hard at what the person he was talking to was saying. You loved seeing him like that, happy and carefree. </p><p>You made to walk over to him, when you saw the person who he was talking to. You stopped dead in your tracks. It was Jenny making him laugh like that. You watched as she put a hand on his arm and leaned in to say something else quietly to him, making him chuckle. You couldn\u2019t help it, but you felt jealousy coursing through you. Chris spotted you and motioned for you to come to him. You looked at Jenny and he followed your eyes, landing on her. Shaking your head, you made your way through the crowd and ended up outside on the terrace.</p><p>Taking a couple of deep breaths of the evening air, you slowly calmed your nerves. You hated how jealous you got; it was ridiculous. Jenny was old news, why even let her get to you? So consumed with your thoughts and the view, you didn\u2019t even hear the footsteps come up behind you.</p><p>\u201cThis place taken?\u201d </p><p>You jumped at the voice but once you realized it was Chris next to you, you relaxed. </p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d you told him, glancing at him briefly before turning back.</p><p>He leaned on the balcony next to you \u201cSo, what was that in there?\u201d </p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNothing. Just\u2026 needed some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, I know you, it was something, tell me.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. There was no point in even hiding it, you figured, you might as well tell him. And so you did. He listened to you, about your awkward encounter in the ladies room, to what you actually thought about what Jenny said. You saw him frown slightly when you told him that you were worried that he might have been ashamed of you at first because it took him a year to take you to something so public.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you know I\u2019m not ashamed of you, right?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything but just looked down at the ground. He sighed and gently turned you to him, then placing his hand under your chin, he lifted your face so you could look at him. He smiled sweetly at you, and, despite how you felt, you smiled back.</p><p>\u201cI could never, ever be ashamed of you.\u201d He said firmly. \u201cYou are too great, too amazing, too smart, too beautiful to ever be ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m n-\u201d you started but he cut you off.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you are. You are all of that and so much more, that\u2019s why I love you so much. Never think I\u2019m ashamed of you.\u201d</p><p>Did he really just say what I think he said? You thought to yourself before asking out loud \u201cYou - you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.

About what?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine.\u201d You frowned slightly at his reflection behind you in the mirror, he was smiling still. \u201cYou look better than fine, you look amazing.\u201d</p><p>You laughed and he wrapped his arms around your waist, kissing your exposed shoulder. </p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHow did I get so lucky?\u201d</p><p>You leaned back into his embrace \u201cI ask myself the same question.\u201d</p><p>Bending his head, he kissed your temple before letting you go. You turned to look at him as he reached for his watch and put it on.<i> How did I get so lucky? </i>You wondered to yourself. You and Chris had been together for a little over a year and you had never been happier. Tonight\u2019s gala was the first public event you were going to together as a couple. You were nervous, you had to admit, but excited also. </p><p>He held out his arms, giving you the full effect of his outfit. \u201cSo, how do I look?\u201d</p><p>You stood back to admire what was before you. He had on a dark blue tux jacket, with black pants and shoes. He looked good like always and you felt yourself inflate with pride at the thought of walking in on his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, as always, sweetie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAs always?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cEven when I wake up in the morning and my hair is all over the place and I have morning breath?\u201d</p><p>You giggled. \u201cYes, especially then.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Especially then\u2019?\u201d He walked over and kissed you on your forehead. \u201cBabe, I\u2019m gonna have to get you glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Evans. You look good and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He said sarcastically. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>You grabbed your clutch. \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm and led you to the door.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Once you got to the gala you started to relax, the nervousness you felt earlier had disappeared. You had to admit you were enjoying yourself. You met a few new people and they had all seem genuinely nice, which took you a little by surprise; you had expected them to be snobby and rude. You did catch one or two sidelong glances at you, when you walked in on Chris\u2019s arm, but they were put out of your mind when Chris put an arm around your waist and pulled you close to his side. You put them out of your mind and decided to enjoy yourself.</p><p>After a few drinks, Chris had convinced you to dance through a couple of songs with him. You couldn\u2019t help but laugh through them and Chris was happy that you were enjoying yourself. When you two had finished dancing, Chris led you over to meet some more people he knew, but you soon had to excuse yourself. Those drinks you had had gone through you and you needed the little girls\u2019 room.</p><p>You slipped in and once you relieved yourself, you came out to wash your hands. You heard one of the stalls behind you open and someone joined you at the sink. You smiled over at the dark haired woman in the mirror. She gave you a thin smile back, then she spoke.</p><p>\u201cHi, you\u2019re Y/N, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. Er, do I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, have I?\u201d You turned to look the woman full in the face and with a shock you realized who she was.</p><p>You were faced to face with Chris\u2019s ex Jenny. You weren\u2019t wholly surprised to see her there, after all there were quite a few celebrities; but you hadn\u2019t expected to run into his ex, especially not alone and in the bathroom of all places.</p><p>Giving a smile at your shocked face, Jenny turned back to the mirror. \u201cSo, you and Chris, huh? How long has that been going on?\u201d</p><p>You were still a bit in shock, but catching yourself, you cleared your throat and finally answered. \u201cUm, just a little over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s just now taking you out in public?\u201d She turned to the mirror with a smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, well, we - we just wanted to keep a low profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Low profile,\u2019 that\u2019s interesting.\u201d She said taking out her lipstick and touching it up.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She replaced the cap on it and put it back into her purse before turning to you. \u201cWell, and this is just me, but if I were dating a guy for over a year, and he hadn\u2019t taken me out in public yet, I\u2019d be kinda suspicious.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBut that\u2019s just me. I mean when he and I were together, people knew.\u201d</p><p>You started to get defensive. Straightening your shoulders and sticking your chin out defiantly you told her \u201cWell, people know now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a year later. \u00a0But if you\u2019re proud\u2026 okay then.\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t have a comeback and once she realized that, she gave you a smile and pushed past you out of the bathroom.</p><p>You turned back to the mirror and stared at your reflection. You hadn\u2019t really thought about it before, but now you were a little concerned. Why had Chris waited a year to show you to everyone? Was he embarrassed by you? Nah, he couldn\u2019t be right? You were here now. \u00a0So that had to mean something,<i> right</i>? You stood there trying to convince yourself that everything was okay. </p><p><i>There\u2019s no need to worry,</i> you said to yourself. She was just trying to get in your head. </p><p>You nodded to yourself, and, taking a deep breath you steadied yourself and walked out with your head held high, determined not to show that you had been upset. Looking around for Chris, you soon spotted him about halfway across the floor. He had his right hand over his chest, head thrown back, laughing hard at what the person he was talking to was saying. You loved seeing him like that, happy and carefree. </p><p>You made to walk over to him, when you saw the person who he was talking to. You stopped dead in your tracks. It was Jenny making him laugh like that. You watched as she put a hand on his arm and leaned in to say something else quietly to him, making him chuckle. You couldn\u2019t help it, but you felt jealousy coursing through you. Chris spotted you and motioned for you to come to him. You looked at Jenny and he followed your eyes, landing on her. Shaking your head, you made your way through the crowd and ended up outside on the terrace.</p><p>Taking a couple of deep breaths of the evening air, you slowly calmed your nerves. You hated how jealous you got; it was ridiculous. Jenny was old news, why even let her get to you? So consumed with your thoughts and the view, you didn\u2019t even hear the footsteps come up behind you.</p><p>\u201cThis place taken?\u201d </p><p>You jumped at the voice but once you realized it was Chris next to you, you relaxed. </p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d you told him, glancing at him briefly before turning back.</p><p>He leaned on the balcony next to you \u201cSo, what was that in there?\u201d </p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNothing. Just\u2026 needed some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, I know you, it was something, tell me.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. There was no point in even hiding it, you figured, you might as well tell him. And so you did. He listened to you, about your awkward encounter in the ladies room, to what you actually thought about what Jenny said. You saw him frown slightly when you told him that you were worried that he might have been ashamed of you at first because it took him a year to take you to something so public.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you know I\u2019m not ashamed of you, right?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything but just looked down at the ground. He sighed and gently turned you to him, then placing his hand under your chin, he lifted your face so you could look at him. He smiled sweetly at you, and, despite how you felt, you smiled back.</p><p>\u201cI could never, ever be ashamed of you.\u201d He said firmly. \u201cYou are too great, too amazing, too smart, too beautiful to ever be ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m n-\u201d you started but he cut you off.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you are. You are all of that and so much more, that\u2019s why I love you so much. Never think I\u2019m ashamed of you.\u201d</p><p>Did he really just say what I think he said? You thought to yourself before asking out loud \u201cYou - you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I know it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m saying it, but I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d was all you could manage, before you stood on your toes and kissed him full on the lips. </p><p>He returned the kiss fervently, wrapping his arms around you and pulling you closer, deepening the kiss.</p><p>When you pulled away, you looked up at him and told him \u201cYou know I love you too right?

You had to admit that the dress was nice. It was a periwinkle blue, one-shoulder, floor-length, tulle gown. You did love how good it looked on you, the color and cut were both very flattering. You did a small spin and it flared out a bit. You couldn\u2019t help but smile. Behind you heard a chuckle.</p><p>You turned and saw Chris standing in the bathroom doorway looking at you. \u201cI did say you looked fine.\u201d</p><p>He was still laughing as he walked towards you. You looked back in the mirror, this time making sure your hair looked good.</p><p>He walked up behind you. \u201cYou know what? I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? About what?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine.\u201d You frowned slightly at his reflection behind you in the mirror, he was smiling still. \u201cYou look better than fine, you look amazing.\u201d</p><p>You laughed and he wrapped his arms around your waist, kissing your exposed shoulder. </p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHow did I get so lucky?\u201d</p><p>You leaned back into his embrace \u201cI ask myself the same question.\u201d</p><p>Bending his head, he kissed your temple before letting you go. You turned to look at him as he reached for his watch and put it on.<i> How did I get so lucky? </i>You wondered to yourself. You and Chris had been together for a little over a year and you had never been happier. Tonight\u2019s gala was the first public event you were going to together as a couple. You were nervous, you had to admit, but excited also. </p><p>He held out his arms, giving you the full effect of his outfit. \u201cSo, how do I look?\u201d</p><p>You stood back to admire what was before you. He had on a dark blue tux jacket, with black pants and shoes. He looked good like always and you felt yourself inflate with pride at the thought of walking in on his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, as always, sweetie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAs always?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cEven when I wake up in the morning and my hair is all over the place and I have morning breath?\u201d</p><p>You giggled. \u201cYes, especially then.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Especially then\u2019?\u201d He walked over and kissed you on your forehead. \u201cBabe, I\u2019m gonna have to get you glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Evans. You look good and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He said sarcastically. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>You grabbed your clutch. \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm and led you to the door.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Once you got to the gala you started to relax, the nervousness you felt earlier had disappeared. You had to admit you were enjoying yourself. You met a few new people and they had all seem genuinely nice, which took you a little by surprise; you had expected them to be snobby and rude. You did catch one or two sidelong glances at you, when you walked in on Chris\u2019s arm, but they were put out of your mind when Chris put an arm around your waist and pulled you close to his side. You put them out of your mind and decided to enjoy yourself.</p><p>After a few drinks, Chris had convinced you to dance through a couple of songs with him. You couldn\u2019t help but laugh through them and Chris was happy that you were enjoying yourself. When you two had finished dancing, Chris led you over to meet some more people he knew, but you soon had to excuse yourself. Those drinks you had had gone through you and you needed the little girls\u2019 room.</p><p>You slipped in and once you relieved yourself, you came out to wash your hands. You heard one of the stalls behind you open and someone joined you at the sink. You smiled over at the dark haired woman in the mirror. She gave you a thin smile back, then she spoke.</p><p>\u201cHi, you\u2019re Y/N, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. Er, do I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, have I?\u201d You turned to look the woman full in the face and with a shock you realized who she was.</p><p>You were faced to face with Chris\u2019s ex Jenny. You weren\u2019t wholly surprised to see her there, after all there were quite a few celebrities; but you hadn\u2019t expected to run into his ex, especially not alone and in the bathroom of all places.</p><p>Giving a smile at your shocked face, Jenny turned back to the mirror. \u201cSo, you and Chris, huh? How long has that been going on?\u201d</p><p>You were still a bit in shock, but catching yourself, you cleared your throat and finally answered. \u201cUm, just a little over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s just now taking you out in public?\u201d She turned to the mirror with a smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, well, we - we just wanted to keep a low profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Low profile,\u2019 that\u2019s interesting.\u201d She said taking out her lipstick and touching it up.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She replaced the cap on it and put it back into her purse before turning to you. \u201cWell, and this is just me, but if I were dating a guy for over a year, and he hadn\u2019t taken me out in public yet, I\u2019d be kinda suspicious.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBut that\u2019s just me. I mean when he and I were together, people knew.\u201d</p><p>You started to get defensive. Straightening your shoulders and sticking your chin out defiantly you told her \u201cWell, people know now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a year later. \u00a0But if you\u2019re proud\u2026 okay then.\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t have a comeback and once she realized that, she gave you a smile and pushed past you out of the bathroom.</p><p>You turned back to the mirror and stared at your reflection. You hadn\u2019t really thought about it before, but now you were a little concerned. Why had Chris waited a year to show you to everyone? Was he embarrassed by you? Nah, he couldn\u2019t be right? You were here now. \u00a0So that had to mean something,<i> right</i>? You stood there trying to convince yourself that everything was okay. </p><p><i>There\u2019s no need to worry,</i> you said to yourself. She was just trying to get in your head. </p><p>You nodded to yourself, and, taking a deep breath you steadied yourself and walked out with your head held high, determined not to show that you had been upset. Looking around for Chris, you soon spotted him about halfway across the floor. He had his right hand over his chest, head thrown back, laughing hard at what the person he was talking to was saying. You loved seeing him like that, happy and carefree. </p><p>You made to walk over to him, when you saw the person who he was talking to. You stopped dead in your tracks. It was Jenny making him laugh like that. You watched as she put a hand on his arm and leaned in to say something else quietly to him, making him chuckle. You couldn\u2019t help it, but you felt jealousy coursing through you. Chris spotted you and motioned for you to come to him. You looked at Jenny and he followed your eyes, landing on her. Shaking your head, you made your way through the crowd and ended up outside on the terrace.</p><p>Taking a couple of deep breaths of the evening air, you slowly calmed your nerves. You hated how jealous you got; it was ridiculous. Jenny was old news, why even let her get to you? So consumed with your thoughts and the view, you didn\u2019t even hear the footsteps come up behind you.</p><p>\u201cThis place taken?\u201d </p><p>You jumped at the voice but once you realized it was Chris next to you, you relaxed. </p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d you told him, glancing at him briefly before turning back.</p><p>He leaned on the balcony next to you \u201cSo, what was that in there?\u201d </p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNothing. Just\u2026 needed some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, I know you, it was something, tell me.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. There was no point in even hiding it, you figured, you might as well tell him. And so you did. He listened to you, about your awkward encounter in the ladies room, to what you actually thought about what Jenny said. You saw him frown slightly when you told him that you were worried that he might have been ashamed of you at first because it took him a year to take you to something so public.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you know I\u2019m not ashamed of you, right?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything but just looked down at the ground. He sighed and gently turned you to him, then placing his hand under your chin, he lifted your face so you could look at him. He smiled sweetly at you, and, despite how you felt, you smiled back.</p><p>\u201cI could never, ever be ashamed of you.\u201d He said firmly. \u201cYou are too great, too amazing, too smart, too beautiful to ever be ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m n-\u201d you started but he cut you off.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you are. You are all of that and so much more, that\u2019s why I love you so much. Never think I\u2019m ashamed of you.\u201d</p><p>Did he really just say what I think he said? You thought to yourself before asking out loud \u201cYou - you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I know it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m saying it, but I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d was all you could manage, before you stood on your toes and kissed him full on the lips. </p><p>He returned the kiss fervently, wrapping his arms around you and pulling you closer, deepening the kiss.</p><p>When you pulled away, you looked up at him and told him \u201cYou know I love you too right? I\u2019m not just saying it cause you said it. I - I really mean it.\u201d</p><p>You were rambling, you knew it, but it just caused Chris to laugh. \u201cYeah, Y/N, I know. I know.\u201d</p><p>And he leaned in and kissed you again. </p><p>\u201cShould we join the party again?\u201d You murmured against his lips.</p><p>\u201cMmmm nah,\u201d he said giving you a peck. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>And with that he pulled on your hand to say your goodbyes and lead you out.</p><p><i>***************</i></p><p><i>Tag List:\u00a0</i></p><p><i>@patzammit <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrfefAu06koV1gfG6lscJfg\">@amendes711</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx55KmwsGJmjaVveZB-9tWw\">@misz-adrii</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_Y5eWbIAhjhOafEhwIiBg\">@lizziththegreat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9T-9GXfN1Ist5mjfNadNdQ\">@whereeverythingisbetter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSP9qzqVrK8KVABdyP626DQ\">@so-not-hotmess</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moX5Hq9zYZ4j2TROG037v7g\">@missnighttigress</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDgzzoy8HvOhxB80iNnDeTg\">@chantelle-x0x</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrVv8fLO7cysGZIShbVjFA\">@tomhardy41</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrOaIspqSm-E0C-CDRlkM8w\">@queenofkings121</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNa03FoOmKPuAsjuLb0iriA\">@emmiejames</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mScX-WaGDiSg4sI7625JHzQ\">@keepyourdreamsalive</a> @xcainic <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_TGkM2v9WtBeHMSEBnK7xg\">@ravenditelegatus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOrzl-8B7be1miZLyqk35rw\">@avengersassemblee</a> @devils-sister-in-law <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjUFN7b083PQr3eQSh3RkFQ\">@hufflepuffkhaleesi</a> @thorandbucky <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfpghK0La-oFMDybx1FFywQ\">@thinkxlovexloud</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnxsu4WiJBgj3BjcQKVokHA\">@originalwombatempathwolf</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbX4sWNuBUXVcwsjALyT0uw\">@thegetawaywriter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNp_KZIeYtZ9SLejoLhNMFw\">@httpmcrvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCXZ3dv93iyP1BGPRhVUT0g\">@cevansgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ-__xYtl9MJjmKJU87F0ag\">@winters-beauty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_3WBqouZAYJ0CBcDbUECA\">@twittytelly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN5QWh-nfJPvFMEAAieH-0g\">@withahintofpestoaioli</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqca13Z50kZuXFFQiBUuDlQ\">@jbug491writinghelp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mivkzsgyrgI2KH8Wkpef6vg\">@heartssick</a></i></p></p>",

You did a small spin and it flared out a bit. You couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. Behind you heard a chuckle.</p>\n<p>You turned and saw Chris standing in the bathroom doorway looking at you. &ldquo;I did say you looked fine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He was still laughing as he walked towards you. You looked back in the mirror, this time making sure your hair looked good.</p>\n<p>He walked up behind you. &ldquo;You know what? I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Huh?
