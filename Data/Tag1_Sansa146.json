If the kidnapping plot happens, I'm sure the directors are going to use the height difference again except this time it will be the Sansa being physically and morally 'taller' than the woman who abused her as a child. The height difference can also play into the YMBQ prophecy with Sansa winning one over Cersei in every way including height.",
