You snorted at your brother\u2019s joke. Paraphys was a spice merchant from Lannisport, a wildly successful one who had more powerful allies than you could count. Your power-hungry father thought it wiser to marry you off to him to win the favor of the people of Lannisport.</p><p>Tyrion and you turned the hallway laughing and stopped dead in your tracks to see your father, Lord Tywin, unamused. Your grip on your younger brother Tyrion tightened. You could say you feared your father, but then again he was also another old pig on the spoke of the goddamn wheel.</p><p>He offered you his arm in silence. You nodded to Tyrion who let you go. Grabbing your father\u2019s arm, he started a small conversation with you.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, father,\u201d you looked ahead. Your eyes were far off from this place.</p><p>\u201cIts days like this where you remind me of your mother,\u201d Tywin said. You snapped back to reality in realizing what he just said.</p><p>\u201cOf mother? What of Cersei?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister could never. She\u2019s too cold. You, my dear, are more like your mother than you realize,\u201d Tywin instilled in you. He pushed back a strand of the famous blonde hair and walked you into the sept. You didn\u2019t believe a single word he said. If your father truly loved you, Paraphys wouldn\u2019t be standing up there, with a golden-toothed smile.</p><p>This was all a charade. Gold was everywhere you looked in the sept. Even your sister, who donned darker colors, wore a golden dress and her hair was as golden and long as yours. She gave you a knowing smile. Your brother, Jaime, a knowing nod. Even your other siblings knew, you were being used and screwed over. <br/>After the sound of bells, a chaste kiss, and the blessing of the King, your nephew, Joffery. Paraphys was now your husband.</p><p>The reception was fill with more awful merchants like him. A cloud of smoke surrounded them as they celebrated. You politely smiled and nodded at anyone who gave you a congratulations. Your eye were still so far off from King\u2019s Landing. As if no one could ever bring you back from the golden void you were left in.</p><p>Until you felt a familiar touch.</p><p>\u201cHello my sun,\u201d Oberyn\u2019s voice was more welcoming and inviting than you\u2019d like to admit.</p><p>\u201cOberyn!\u201d A grand smile spread across your face. Warmth spread to your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAh, I still see that you grow pink when I call you that even now when you are married,\u201d he told you.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you made it here of all places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either, but I came for good reason,\u201d Oberyn pointed a glare at your father who looked stern and still as ever.</p><p>\u201cElia.\u201d The name brought back the terrible stories and memories of her. You noticed Oberyn\u2019s weight shifted towards your father and you pulled him away. You started walking in the opposite direction of the party and towards somewhere more private. \u201cI remember your sister. She had always been kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an incredibly kind person,\u201d Oberyn responded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you shook your head. \u201cI meant that your sister\u2019s memory shouldn\u2019t be tarnished with violence. She was so kind and so selfless. She loved and loved and loved\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd she died for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lived for it,\u201d you corrected him. Oberyn\u2019s back hit the wall. His eyes were still on you in your flowing wedding dress.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to marry you,\u201d Oberyn confessed. Your felt a hunger and a pain in your chest. Oberyn continued. \u201cOnly she knew how much I cared for you. I shouldn\u2019t have let this happen. Paraphys is a low-born pig and he doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know exactly what overcame you. One moment you stood in front of him, the next your lips were against his. You kissed him with a hunger that you hid for years. The feel and taste of him satisfied all those nights you spent alone. Oberyn\u2019s hands swept through your golden hair and held you tight to him. It seems, he had the same hunger for years as well.</p><p>He pulled away from you and looked around. You did the same. After all, you were married now. Anyone who caught you would be your first ticket to a death sentence from your nephew. You pulled Oberyn away and went deeper into the gardens. Oberyn stole more kisses from you as both of you rushed through the gardens and towards the beach.</p><p>Waves crashed and kissed the shore. The sand darkened where those kisses were felt. That\u2019s where Oberyn laid you down away from any kind of prying eyes. He chuckled as he undid your wedding corset faster than you expected.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d he laughed into another kiss he placed your lips. He was warm and inviting against the cold water that touched your hair. He kissed down your neck and chest. Each kiss was harder, longer, and hurt more. You ran a hand through his dark hair, laughing. You wondered why you didn\u2019t marry him instead.</p><p>He lifted your skirts in a frenzy that made you smile. It faded when you felt his warm hands on your inner thighs. His hot breath on your womanly parts made your eyes roll back. Oberyn was the most experienced lover in Westeros, and his way of loving was truly for pleasure. When his mouth set to work down there, you knew. His tongue dragged up and down slowly. He built you up with tension.</p><p>\u201cOberyn,\u201d you sighed. He pushed some your skirts away. His smile had not gone unnoticed by you. He pushed his fingers in and out of you a couple of times. You watched him taste your essence, letting him fully enjoy you. He pushed his fingers back in and reached for your face. Kissing you hard so you couldn\u2019t make a sound. You moaned in his mouth over until you were out of breath.</p><p>Oberyn pulled you up as you pushed him down. His body now in the sand and you on top. His long and hardened penis waited for you to descend upon it. As wet as you were, you did it with complete ease. You watched Oberyn\u2019s eyes roll back as he was deep inside you. You moved up and down on him until his hands found your hips. He controlled your every movement now.</p><p>He needed you. He wanted you. Now. Oberyn and you worked together moving against each other as if it was the only thing you were born for. You felt your internal clock winding up. It grew tighter which each turn it took. Oberyn\u2019s grip on you was intoxicating. His warm hands rubbed your inner thighs. You thought of him as yours and yours only.</p><p>You would want this forever. And then you lost it. You giggled as you came all over him. His orgasm came not long after. He pumped the last few strokes in you before you fell beside him. You giggled as he kissed your face in the sand.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Oberyn told you. You heard the crashing waves. You felt the warm and cold sand. You looked into Oberyn\u2019s wonderfully brown eyes. You had nothing here, but with him, you had everything.</p><p>The next boat to Dorne took off in secret. A Lannister and a Martell, entangled in each other\u2019s lives.</p><p><b>Ultimate Tag List (People who wished to be tagged in EVERY work I post.)</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\">@angelicshinigami</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\">@sugarwastaken</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\">@carilov09</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\">@i-theredqueen</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\">@loki-0fasgard</a></p><p>To be added, removed, or switched on these taglists, only ask!</p>",

You snorted at your brother\u2019s joke. Paraphys was a spice merchant from Lannisport, a wildly successful one who had more powerful allies than you could count. Your power-hungry father thought it wiser to marry you off to him to win the favor of the people of Lannisport.</p><p>Tyrion and you turned the hallway laughing and stopped dead in your tracks to see your father, Lord Tywin, unamused.

You snorted at your brother\u2019s joke. Paraphys was a spice merchant from Lannisport, a wildly successful one who had more powerful allies than you could count. Your power-hungry father thought it wiser to marry you off to him to win the favor of the people of Lannisport.</p><p>Tyrion and you turned the hallway laughing and stopped dead in your tracks to see your father, Lord Tywin, unamused. Your grip on your younger brother Tyrion tightened. You could say you feared your father, but then again he was also another old pig on the spoke of the goddamn wheel.</p><p>He offered you his arm in silence. You nodded to Tyrion who let you go. Grabbing your father\u2019s arm, he started a small conversation with you.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, father,\u201d you looked ahead. Your eyes were far off from this place.</p><p>\u201cIts days like this where you remind me of your mother,\u201d Tywin said. You snapped back to reality in realizing what he just said.</p><p>\u201cOf mother? What of Cersei?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister could never. She\u2019s too cold. You, my dear, are more like your mother than you realize,\u201d Tywin instilled in you. He pushed back a strand of the famous blonde hair and walked you into the sept. You didn\u2019t believe a single word he said. If your father truly loved you, Paraphys wouldn\u2019t be standing up there, with a golden-toothed smile.</p><p>This was all a charade. Gold was everywhere you looked in the sept. Even your sister, who donned darker colors, wore a golden dress and her hair was as golden and long as yours. She gave you a knowing smile. Your brother, Jaime, a knowing nod. Even your other siblings knew, you were being used and screwed over. <br>After the sound of bells, a chaste kiss, and the blessing of the King, your nephew, Joffery. Paraphys was now your husband.</p><p>The reception was fill with more awful merchants like him. A cloud of smoke surrounded them as they celebrated. You politely smiled and nodded at anyone who gave you a congratulations. Your eye were still so far off from King\u2019s Landing. As if no one could ever bring you back from the golden void you were left in.</p><p>Until you felt a familiar touch.</p><p>\u201cHello my sun,\u201d Oberyn\u2019s voice was more welcoming and inviting than you\u2019d like to admit.</p><p>\u201cOberyn!\u201d A grand smile spread across your face. Warmth spread to your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAh, I still see that you grow pink when I call you that even now when you are married,\u201d he told you.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you made it here of all places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either, but I came for good reason,\u201d Oberyn pointed a glare at your father who looked stern and still as ever.</p><p>\u201cElia.\u201d The name brought back the terrible stories and memories of her. You noticed Oberyn\u2019s weight shifted towards your father and you pulled him away. You started walking in the opposite direction of the party and towards somewhere more private. \u201cI remember your sister. She had always been kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an incredibly kind person,\u201d Oberyn responded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you shook your head. \u201cI meant that your sister\u2019s memory shouldn\u2019t be tarnished with violence. She was so kind and so selfless. She loved and loved and loved\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd she died for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lived for it,\u201d you corrected him. Oberyn\u2019s back hit the wall. His eyes were still on you in your flowing wedding dress.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to marry you,\u201d Oberyn confessed. Your felt a hunger and a pain in your chest. Oberyn continued. \u201cOnly she knew how much I cared for you. I shouldn\u2019t have let this happen. Paraphys is a low-born pig and he doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know exactly what overcame you. One moment you stood in front of him, the next your lips were against his. You kissed him with a hunger that you hid for years. The feel and taste of him satisfied all those nights you spent alone. Oberyn\u2019s hands swept through your golden hair and held you tight to him. It seems, he had the same hunger for years as well.</p><p>He pulled away from you and looked around. You did the same. After all, you were married now. Anyone who caught you would be your first ticket to a death sentence from your nephew. You pulled Oberyn away and went deeper into the gardens. Oberyn stole more kisses from you as both of you rushed through the gardens and towards the beach.</p><p>Waves crashed and kissed the shore. The sand darkened where those kisses were felt. That\u2019s where Oberyn laid you down away from any kind of prying eyes. He chuckled as he undid your wedding corset faster than you expected.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d he laughed into another kiss he placed your lips. He was warm and inviting against the cold water that touched your hair. He kissed down your neck and chest. Each kiss was harder, longer, and hurt more. You ran a hand through his dark hair, laughing. You wondered why you didn\u2019t marry him instead.</p><p>He lifted your skirts in a frenzy that made you smile. It faded when you felt his warm hands on your inner thighs. His hot breath on your womanly parts made your eyes roll back. Oberyn was the most experienced lover in Westeros, and his way of loving was truly for pleasure. When his mouth set to work down there, you knew. His tongue dragged up and down slowly. He built you up with tension.</p><p>\u201cOberyn,\u201d you sighed. He pushed some your skirts away. His smile had not gone unnoticed by you. He pushed his fingers in and out of you a couple of times. You watched him taste your essence, letting him fully enjoy you. He pushed his fingers back in and reached for your face. Kissing you hard so you couldn\u2019t make a sound. You moaned in his mouth over until you were out of breath.</p><p>Oberyn pulled you up as you pushed him down. His body now in the sand and you on top. His long and hardened penis waited for you to descend upon it. As wet as you were, you did it with complete ease. You watched Oberyn\u2019s eyes roll back as he was deep inside you. You moved up and down on him until his hands found your hips. He controlled your every movement now.</p><p>He needed you. He wanted you. Now. Oberyn and you worked together moving against each other as if it was the only thing you were born for. You felt your internal clock winding up. It grew tighter which each turn it took. Oberyn\u2019s grip on you was intoxicating. His warm hands rubbed your inner thighs. You thought of him as yours and yours only.</p><p>You would want this forever. And then you lost it. You giggled as you came all over him. His orgasm came not long after. He pumped the last few strokes in you before you fell beside him. You giggled as he kissed your face in the sand.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Oberyn told you. You heard the crashing waves. You felt the warm and cold sand. You looked into Oberyn\u2019s wonderfully brown eyes. You had nothing here, but with him, you had everything.</p><p>The next boat to Dorne took off in secret. A Lannister and a Martell, entangled in each other\u2019s lives.</p><p><b>Ultimate Tag List (People who wished to be tagged in EVERY work I post.)</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\">@angelicshinigami</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\">@sugarwastaken</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\">@carilov09</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\">@i-theredqueen</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\">@loki-0fasgard</a></p><p>To be added, removed, or switched on these taglists, only ask!</p>",
