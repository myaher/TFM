That of course, its not a lie, but I do think it was a way for books and show to deceives us, to overestimate Tyrion\u2019s intelligence and underestimate Jaime\u2019s capability as a leader and as a judge of human character. Jaime was the one who told to Jory on S1 E4 how dangerous Theon seemed to be for House Stark and what a risk his was for the family, while Tyrion could only mock the way Theon talked about his masters. Jaime proved to be the one right since later Theon would betray House Stark and take Winterfell.</p><p>Saving the lives of innocent people and spare blood shed seems to be a constant on Jaime\u2019s live. He saved the life of millions of people in KL and instead of being made a hero, he became a disgraced man, and oathbreaker, a man without honor because only few knew the reason why he did what he did.</p><p>Yet, Jaime still kept on trying to save lives during his life, in fact, it got my attention in my re watch that he did offer himself to fight Robb Stark in a man to man combat, in order to avoid the war between Starks and Lannisters. Thats exactly what Jon Snow did in season 6, but of course at the time we all thought he was a jackass to make such offer, because we knew it he was a great swordfighter and would of course beat Robb Stark, but he was trying to save the lives of thousands because that\u2019s one of the constants in Jaime\u2019s life. He is always trying to avoid more blood shed.</p><!-- more --><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ed7fbf48ff80adaef60b09a8364c2eb/tumblr_inline_pe18zc8kiK1sgp768_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>When he was sent to Riverland to take back the Tully\u2019s castle he tried every way he could to avoid more deaths and more conflicts.

A leader, a king, a ruler should always try to save their people and try other methods before war. George RRM is a anti war man, but he does believes that some war are necessary and unavoidable, BUT if there is chance for peace, it should be explored.</p><p>So, I believe George RRM has big plans for Jaime in the end of this story and will award him with a hppy ending for caring so much for the lives of the people in Westeros.</p><p><br/></p><p>* <b>S1E1 </b>in his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days. Remember Jaime always uses jokes to deflect insecurance or frustration. I actually think he likes the idea.</p><p>* <b>S1E1 </b>When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. &ldquo;The Starks are feasting on this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people&rdquo;</p><p>That already got my attention. I expect the Jon and the Starks to rule the kingdom in the end and a new time, a time for wolves to start in Westeros by the end of this story, and I think Jaime will be the last Lannister left to restore his House.</p><p>* <b>S1E2 </b>Later we see Jaime going to Jon Snow to thank him for joining the NW, he offers his right hand and makes a joke about Jon&rsquo;s decision. They even make sure to focus on the hand shake.</p><p>* When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King &ldquo;how do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it?</p><p>Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.</p><p>* <b>S1E5 </b>- in the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.</p><p>* <b>S1E5 </b>Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!</p><p>How many times now did they mention Jaime and the Hand of the King job? how did I miss this in my first views of the show? I was actually shocked.</p><p>* <b>S1E7 </b>- Tywin is introduced in that awesome scene with the dead stag and in that scene he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. Jaime now in season 7 is finally taking back his life and becoming the hero we all expect him to be.<br/>Jaime completely outsmarted Tyrion in season 7 using the mistakes he made in the past as a lesson. Jaime and Jon were literally the two leaders on season 7 trying to save their people from unecessary deaths. He went to Cersei to tells her that they couldnt win against Dragons, he wanted her to surrender to Dany to save the lives of his armies and his people; he decided to abandon her to go fight North and save the realm. He is finally becoming the man he is supposed to be. </p><p>And that quote from Jon in season 7 also made me think of him and Jaime &quot;my father used to say, we find our true friends in the battlefield&rdquo;. I think Jon and Jaime will forge a nice relationship in season 8 and Jon will need someone with experience in Kings Landing. Jaime lived his whole life in the capital and watched his father and Jon Arryn being hands of the king for decades. He will help Jon to be a better king.</p><p>There is also foreshadowed in the books about this ending game possibility.

That of course, its not a lie, but I do think it was a way for books and show to deceives us, to overestimate Tyrion\u2019s intelligence and underestimate Jaime\u2019s capability as a leader and as a judge of human character. Jaime was the one who told to Jory on S1 E4 how dangerous Theon seemed to be for House Stark and what a risk his was for the family, while Tyrion could only mock the way Theon talked about his masters. Jaime proved to be the one right since later Theon would betray House Stark and take Winterfell.</p><p>Saving the lives of innocent people and spare blood shed seems to be a constant on Jaime\u2019s live. He saved the life of millions of people in KL and instead of being made a hero, he became a disgraced man, and oathbreaker, a man without honor because only few knew the reason why he did what he did.</p><p>Yet, Jaime still kept on trying to save lives during his life, in fact, it got my attention in my re watch that he did offer himself to fight Robb Stark in a man to man combat, in order to avoid the war between Starks and Lannisters. Thats exactly what Jon Snow did in season 6, but of course at the time we all thought he was a jackass to make such offer, because we knew it he was a great swordfighter and would of course beat Robb Stark, but he was trying to save the lives of thousands because that\u2019s one of the constants in Jaime\u2019s life. He is always trying to avoid more blood shed.</p>[[MORE]]<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ed7fbf48ff80adaef60b09a8364c2eb/tumblr_inline_pe18zc8kiK1sgp768_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>When he was sent to Riverland to take back the Tully\u2019s castle he tried every way he could to avoid more deaths and more conflicts.

A leader, a king, a ruler should always try to save their people and try other methods before war. George RRM is a anti war man, but he does believes that some war are necessary and unavoidable, BUT if there is chance for peace, it should be explored.</p><p>So, I believe George RRM has big plans for Jaime in the end of this story and will award him with a hppy ending for caring so much for the lives of the people in Westeros.</p><p><br></p><p>* <b>S1E1 </b>in his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days.

I actually think he likes the idea.</p><p>* <b>S1E1 </b>When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. \u201cThe Starks are feasting on this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people\u201d</p><p>That already got my attention. I expect the Jon and the Starks to rule the kingdom in the end and a new time, a time for wolves to start in Westeros by the end of this story, and I think Jaime will be the last Lannister left to restore his House.</p><p>* <b>S1E2 </b>Later we see Jaime going to Jon Snow to thank him for joining the NW, he offers his right hand and makes a joke about Jon\u2019s decision. They even make sure to focus on the hand shake.</p><p>* When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King \u201chow do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it?</p><p>Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.</p><p>* <b>S1E5 </b>- in the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.</p><p>* <b>S1E5 </b>Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!</p><p>How many times now did they mention Jaime and the Hand of the King job? how did I miss this in my first views of the show? I was actually shocked.</p><p>* <b>S1E7 </b>- Tywin is introduced in that awesome scene with the dead stag and in that scene he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. Jaime now in season 7 is finally taking back his life and becoming the hero we all expect him to be.<br>Jaime completely outsmarted Tyrion in season 7 using the mistakes he made in the past as a lesson. Jaime and Jon were literally the two leaders on season 7 trying to save their people from unecessary deaths. He went to Cersei to tells her that they couldnt win against Dragons, he wanted her to surrender to Dany to save the lives of his armies and his people; he decided to abandon her to go fight North and save the realm. He is finally becoming the man he is supposed to be. </p><p>And that quote from Jon in season 7 also made me think of him and Jaime \"my father used to say, we find our true friends in the battlefield\u201d. I think Jon and Jaime will forge a nice relationship in season 8 and Jon will need someone with experience in Kings Landing. Jaime lived his whole life in the capital and watched his father and Jon Arryn being hands of the king for decades.
