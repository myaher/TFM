The light hit your eyelids, causing you to rub them, and open them. You faced away from the sunlight, and your eyes were adjusting to the brightness. A good nights sleep, without any distractions. You stretched your arms and legs out, feeling much better. You reached out for your phone, looking at all the messages from your best friend.</p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>YN!!!! It\u2019s tattoo dayyyyy</i></p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>You better be up by 11 we don\u2019t wanna be late. we can pick him up from Grace\u2019s after you get the tattoo done. I can\u2019t wait to see his reaction omg</i></p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>I\u2019m so excited!!! You should get drunk more often I love it when you say stupid things and can\u2019t get out of it</i></p><p>Your eyes squinted at the messages, and then the time. It showed 10:30am, which meant you had 30 minutes to get ready. You rolled your eyes, before leaping out of bed, goosebumps on your body from the lack of warmth from under the duvet. You groaned, as you walked into the bathroom, freshening up and brushing your teeth. You jumped down the stairs, preparing yourself breakfast. You took out a bowl, pouring some milk into it. You then added the crunchy cereal, before taking a banana from the fruit bowl. You sat down with your food, spooning the cereal into your mouth, until it was all gone. You unlocked your phone, smiling at your wallpaper, and scrolled through your social media, nibbling on your banana whilst keeping an eye on the time. When the clock hit 10:45am, you placed the bowl and spoon into the dishwasher, and the banana peel in the food waste bin, before jogging back up the stairs to get ready. </p><p>You opened your closet, browsing through your clothes. You picked out a grey, fuzzy jumper and a pair of blue jeans. You changed into your outfit, slipping your socks onto you feet. You then sat down in front of your vanity, brushing your hair out, freeing any knots and tangles. You threw it up in a high ponytail, securing it with a neutral coloured hair tie. You put some moisturiser onto your face, applying some subtle makeup. The misty, pink perfume bottle that stood on your desk was picked up. You spritzed it over yourself, before packing your small side bag. You put your wallet and keys in there, as well as a packet of tissues. You then checked your phone, to find that you were right on time. You headed downstairs, waiting for your best friend to ring the bell. Shortly after, the bell rang and you opened the door. She smiled at you widely, while you rolled your eyes. She dragged you to the car, and you put your seatbelt on, waiting for her to drive to the tattoo shop. </p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t even remember saying that I\u2019d get a tattoo, I don\u2019t want one, remember?\u201d You exclaimed, looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t, you were drunk! But, you definitely said that you were going to get a tattoo, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Your friend said, trying to find a parking space.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, I thought you were joking! You know tattoos hurt?\u201d You said, slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I have three, they\u2019re not that bad. I found a design for you, it\u2019s small and simple, just how you\u2019d like it. I\u2019ve got you, don\u2019t worry!\u201d </p><p>Finally, an empty spot was found for your best friend to park her car. You stayed seated, while she opened the door. You poured crossing your arms, looking away. You could hear your friend laugh, and tug at your arm. She managed to pull you out, and started to lug you all the way to the tattoo shop. The shop\u2019s name was<i> \u2018Ink Me Up\u2019 </i>and you tilted your head. You stood outside the black, graffitied shop, reacting with an, \u2018<i>uh&hellip;\u2019 </i>in confusion. Your best friend gave you a reassuring look, before opening the door and calling out for an employee. While she waited for someone to come, you scanned the room. It smelt of cigarettes, and alcohol. It was strong, but a few windows were open for ventilation. </p><p>The room was dark, posters and even more graffiti were on the inside. You saw three rooms, suggesting that there were three tattoo artists. There was also a room that had a sign saying, \u2018store\u2019 which is probably where they kept all the ink and equipment. There was a small couch for clients to sit. On top of the coffee table was a book of tattoo designs, and as you flicked through them, you couldn\u2019t help but open your mouth in awe at how detailed the drawings are. The place was rather quiet, the doors were shut but you could still hear the muffled conversations between the client and artist and the whirring of the ink pen. Out of the store room, came a rather short man, with a few tattoos across his arms. He had a metal lip piercing, which he fiddled with using his tongue. He also had lots of piercings on his ear, his double helix intriguing you the most. He brushed his dark hair out of the way, walking behind the counter. Your friend smiled at him, but you couldn\u2019t see him smile back.</p><p>\u201cHey, I booked an appointment for my friend here to get a tattoo.\u201d She said, pointing at you. </p><p>You were still flicking through the book, when you felt his eyes glaring against you. You looked up, smiling nervously at him. He hummed, looking through the book.</p><p>\u201cYN?\u201d He asked, and you nodded.</p><p>He asked for some ID, and you fished your wallet out, showing him your drivers license. He took it in his hands, checking your age and the card. He nodded, before taking down your details. You told him your address and phone number. You began to take your card out, but your friend stopped you, paying it for you. </p><p>\u201cYou were drunk, there\u2019s no need to pay.\u201d You smiled at her, and she laughed in reply. The man gave her the receipt. </p><p>He took a black pen and ticked you off the list and wrote your details on the client information list, and said that another client will finish in 5 minutes. He offered some water, to which you both declined politely. He went into the room in the middle, and didn\u2019t come back out until 5 minutes later. </p><p>\u201cYou can go now, is your friend coming with you?\u201d He questioned, awaiting a reply.</p><p>\u201cUh&hellip; yeah, yeah, she\u2019s coming.\u201d You said, grabbing her hand and walking into the middle room.</p><p>The room was dimly lit, the walls painted black. The tattoo artist was facing away from you, probably cleaning up. The man was wearing a tight, black polo shirt, that enhanced his back muscles, wide shoulders and the sleeves cupped around his bisceps. He had dark brown hair, styled in a gorgeous undercut. He was heavily tattooed, designs all up his arms, neck, and as he bent down, you could see more tattoos leading to his back (as his shirt rode up). </p><p>\u201cYou can sit down on the chair, I\u2019ll be there in a few secs.\u201d He spoke, in a deep and calming voice. </p><p>You obeyed what he said, sitting on the cushioned chair. Your friend noticed that you were fidgety and nervous, and so she laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking this better than I thought. Do you wanna see the design, will it make you feel better?\u201d </p><p>You nodded your head, twisting your fingers. Your friend unlocked her phone, scrolling through her camera roll. You saw her eyes light up when she found the picture. She gave her phone to you, and you scanned the design. </p><p>You smiled, feeling better that you weren\u2019t going to get some tattoo with her name on your wrist. You could hear the man roll his chair toward you, so you gave the phone back to your friend. You adjusted yourself so you were facing the man, when you felt yourself freeze. Your eyes widened, and you felt your breath hitch in your throat. It was as if time had stopped, and the only thing moving was your heart beating rapidly. The man did the exact same, opening his mouth slightly in shock. You could hear your friend speak in the background, but you weren\u2019t listening, and you were sure that he wasn\u2019t listening either. </p><p><i>Jeon Jungkook.</i></p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Your friend repeated, \u201cThis is the design.\u201d </p><p>Jungkook whipped his head toward your friend, taking the phone into his large hands. He cleared his throat, before grabbing the right equipment. Jungkook took your wrist in his hands, and you could feel the latex of his gloves. Your hand trembled slightly, and he looked up at you. You looked away from him, and you felt very uncomfortable with your friend in the room. He took out a wipe, that was doused in rubbing alcohol. He hesitated, but eventually, cold material touched your skin, cleaning it. Although you were doing the tattoo on the inside of your wrist, the tiniest hairs would cause a problem, so he took any stray hairs off with a disposable razor. While Jungkook went to make the stencil, you talked to your friend, \u201cActually, you can wait outside, I\u2019m not that scared anymore.\u201d You saw Jungkook\u2019s ears perk up from the corner of your eye.</p><p>Your friend patted you on the back, walking out of the room. Jungkook places the stencil on your wrist, dampening it with some soapy water, so the design would print onto your wrist. You saw the purple design on your wrist, as Jungkook began preparing the ink equipment, sterilising them. He rubbed a little ointment over your design, probably so that it wouldn\u2019t rub off, and for a smoother surface for the inky needle to slide across. You watched him start the pen, and the whirring sound floated to your ears. Your heart was beating fast, and your palms grew clammy, but not because of the tattoo. Because of Jungkook. The pain of the tattoo was the last of your problems. </p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d You spoke, voice slightly cracking. </p><p>Jungkook lifted the pen off of your skin, still looking down, \u201cNow\u2019s not the time.\u201d He carried on, making the black outline. </p><p>You weren\u2019t giving up so easily, this could be the only time he\u2019d speak to you, \u201cPlease, why\u2019d you leave? I thought  we had something?\u201d You said, trying not to burst into tears. </p><p>Jungkook began shading in the tattoo with the same colours as the picture he was shown, an orange ombr\u00e9. You saw him switch the needles to magnums, and began to colour it in. He gulped, colouring it in. </p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I left.\u201d </p><p>You laughed slightly, eyes glossing over with tears, \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>Jungkoook stayed silent, blowing on the tattoo, and applying some ointment. He applied a bandage over it, and began talking to you about the after care procedure, giving you a leaflet on it too. He barely looked up at you this whole day, except when he first saw you. You were hoping he\u2019d look at you, but he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play with the bandage, it\u2019s there so it doesn\u2019t get infected. After two hours, you can take it off. Once you\u2019ve taken it off, wash it under warm water with some antibacterial soap, just use your hands. Don\u2019t rub the tattoo, just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dodge the question, Jungkook.\u201d You said, sternly. </p><p>He sighed again, continuing with his talk, \u201cJust pat it dry. Don\u2019t swim. If there are any scabs, use a warm towel to soften them and they\u2019ll come off.\u201d You scoffed, feeling the tears drop down your face. He was just acting like he didn\u2019t know you.</p><p>\u201cPut some sunscreen on, just as you normally would, over the tattoo. And that\u2019s it. You can head back to reception and show it to your friend now.\u201d He said, tidying his desk. You began to sob, looking at the blurry picture of your tattoo of a sunset. He could hear you, and he looked up at you. He felt his heart break, and his eyes softened. He sighed, taking a tissue and passing it to you. You turned away however, walking to the door, using your other sleeve to wipe them away. Jungkook walked behind you, holding your shoulder. He turned you so you faced him, seeing your puffy, red eyes. You sniffled, as you let out another sob. He scrunched the tissue up a little bit, wiping your tears. </p><p>\u201cI left because I liked you. If I stayed, I knew I\u2019d treat you like shit, but I was scared, and too much of a coward to even try be nice to you.\u201d </p><p>You looked up, taking the tissue from his hands, \u201cBut you were nice to me, you-\u201c you spoke, as he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I ignored you at school, I ignored you outside, all because I didn\u2019t want to lose my reputation as \u2018<i>bad boy Jungkook, who gets all the girls</i>\u2019, I was so stupid. I was embarrassed being with you. Heck, I even ignored you here, and your friend doesn\u2019t even know me!\u201d He said sitting back down in his chair, but making eye contact with you. You saw his eyes water too.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I didn\u2019t mind!\u201d You said, walking closer to him.</p><p>\u201cBut <i>I</i> did. I didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed, but I was. No one should treat you like that.\u201d He said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I hate you for leaving me without even telling. But, I can\u2019t hate you forever. Seeing you today, I just&hellip; It\u2019s coming back. All my feelings.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYN, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s been years, you\u2019ve got to forget about us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat we had, was special, Jungkook. You knew that. You were embarrassed, but it was nothing like you had with the other girls. Can\u2019t we try again?\u201d You pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYN, I think you should leave now.\u201d He said, turning away from you. </p><p>\u201cI knew I recognised those drawings. You used to draw them on me, with pens, when I came over. You\u2019d do them with different colours too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYN, please, stop.\u201d He said, feeling overwhelmed but he memories he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cI used to come to your apartment all the time, and we\u2019d play games. You\u2019d get really competitive over Overwatch. Sometimes, when we weren\u2019t in the mood to do anything, we\u2019d just lie in bed, and sleep. Other times, we\u2019d go out, and eat lots of food. I miss that, don\u2019t you?\u201d You asked.</p><p>Jungkook stayed silent, and you realised that maybe he was right. Maybe you did need to let go, and forget about what you had. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll-\u201c You said, opening the door to exit. </p><p>\u201cI did. I missed you a lot. I never had another girlfriend after you.\u201d You stopped in your tracks, turning around to see Jungkook standing behind you. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d You said, pushing the door closed. </p><p>Jungkook shook his head, his brown orbs staring into yours. You observed his face, nothing much changed, except a few things. He had certainly become more handsome. He styled his hair much better. He had various piercings on his ears. You could see the colourful tattoos crawl up his neck. He still had his doe-eyes, that you could melt in. He still cared for you, even if he showed it with some hesitance. He was still Jungkook. You hugged Jungkook, careful of your arm, resting your head against his shoulder. He hugged you too, wrapping his arms around your waist. He lifted your head up, looking into your eyes before kissing you. You felt his plump lips against yours, and you definitely missed it. Your hands interlocked, as he began to deepen the kiss, but then he stopped. You were confused, you thought he wanted this. He walked a few steps back, a pained look in his face. </p><p>\u201cYN, I can\u2019t, I really can\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cJungkook, it\u2019s okay, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, YN. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, YN, I can\u2019t. I, uh..\u201d </p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows, \u201cWhat is it Jungkook?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know you have a kid.\u201d</p><p>You closed your eyes, covering your face with your hands, before taking them down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your kid, Jungkook. He\u2019s your son. I.. I don\u2019t understand, how did you..?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy friend told me. I\u2019m sorry, but, I can\u2019t look after a kid.\u201d You scoffed, raising your eyebrows. You were annoyed, he did this to you, and he\u2019s just leaving you\u2014 again. </p><p>\u201cAnd you think I can? It\u2019s so hard looking after a 4 year old boy, by myself, and I\u2019m not home half the time because of work! And you say that you can\u2019t look after a kid? This was your doing Jungkook, you said it was okay. How did you think I felt?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d A knock on the door interrupted what you were going to say, \u201cYN, why is it taking so long? It wasn\u2019t that hard, was it? Are you okay?\u201d You cleared your throat, replying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m coming now.\u201d </p><p>You opened the door, walking out. You showed your friend the tattoo, and she was really impressed at how the ombr\u00e9 turned out. You glanced at Jungkook, who was looking everywhere in the room, but you. He shoved his hands in the pockets of his jeans, staring at the ground. The other tattoo artists came out, whispering, \u2018<i>Hey, wasn\u2019t that your girlfriend? The one you were telling us?</i>\u2019 You looked at Jungkook\u2019s reaction. He just walked back inside the room, not uttering a word. You and your friend waved goodbye to the others. </p><p>\u201cThanks, we\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d Your friend yelled, exiting the building.</p><p>When you got into the car, you spoke to your friend, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018<i>we\u2019ll be back soon</i>\u2019?\u201d </p><p>She laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re obviously going to get drunk again.\u201d </p><p>For a few minutes it was silent, and then you spoke up. </p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you I was in a relationship? But he left, suddenly?\u201d </p><p>You saw your friend nod her head, urging you to carry on. \u201cHe was the tattoo artist.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat? It was him? Is that why you asked me to go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I needed to sort things out with him. I&hellip; missed him, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJeez, what\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that he was embarrassed, and he\u2019s sorry. I thought we were going to start again, because he kissed me. But his friend told him about Junseok, and he doesn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. Something about not being able to look after a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck? After it was his doing? YN, I\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t help you. But, you and Junseok are fine together, you have me if you need any help, you know that. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll find someone who\u2019ll look after you and Junseok, unlike him.\u201d You nodded at her comment. You almost reached home, when you felt your phone buzz in your side bag. You pulled it out, seeing a message. </p><p><b>From: xx-xxxx-xxxxx</b></p><p><i>hey it\u2019s jungkook i got your number off the client list. I\u2019m really sorry yn. i really am. what i said was wrong, really wrong. what\u2019s his name? can i maybe see him one day, if that\u2019s okay?</i></p><p><b>To: Jungkook</b></p><p><i>yes. what you said was wrong, i went through all of that by myself, and heck, i don\u2019t even know what i\u2019m doing. but junseok needs a father in his life so it might as well be you. i\u2019ll think about it and text you back</i></p><p>He replied with a<i> \u2018thanks yn i really appreciate it\u2019 </i>and you turned your phone off.</p>",

She dragged you to the car, and you put your seatbelt on, waiting for her to drive to the tattoo shop. </p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t even remember saying that I\u2019d get a tattoo, I don\u2019t want one, remember?\u201d You exclaimed, looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t, you were drunk! But, you definitely said that you were going to get a tattoo, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Your friend said, trying to find a parking space.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, I thought you were joking! You know tattoos hurt?\u201d You said, slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I have three, they\u2019re not that bad. I found a design for you, it\u2019s small and simple, just how you\u2019d like it. I\u2019ve got you, don\u2019t worry!\u201d </p><p>Finally, an empty spot was found for your best friend to park her car. You stayed seated, while she opened the door. You poured crossing your arms, looking away. You could hear your friend laugh, and tug at your arm. She managed to pull you out, and started to lug you all the way to the tattoo shop. The shop\u2019s name was<i> \u2018Ink Me Up\u2019 </i>and you tilted your head. You stood outside the black, graffitied shop, reacting with an, \u2018<i>uh\u2026\u2019 </i>in confusion. Your best friend gave you a reassuring look, before opening the door and calling out for an employee. While she waited for someone to come, you scanned the room. It smelt of cigarettes, and alcohol. It was strong, but a few windows were open for ventilation. </p><p>The room was dark, posters and even more graffiti were on the inside. You saw three rooms, suggesting that there were three tattoo artists. There was also a room that had a sign saying, \u2018store\u2019 which is probably where they kept all the ink and equipment. There was a small couch for clients to sit. On top of the coffee table was a book of tattoo designs, and as you flicked through them, you couldn\u2019t help but open your mouth in awe at how detailed the drawings are. The place was rather quiet, the doors were shut but you could still hear the muffled conversations between the client and artist and the whirring of the ink pen. Out of the store room, came a rather short man, with a few tattoos across his arms. He had a metal lip piercing, which he fiddled with using his tongue. He also had lots of piercings on his ear, his double helix intriguing you the most. He brushed his dark hair out of the way, walking behind the counter. Your friend smiled at him, but you couldn\u2019t see him smile back.</p><p>\u201cHey, I booked an appointment for my friend here to get a tattoo.\u201d She said, pointing at you. </p><p>You were still flicking through the book, when you felt his eyes glaring against you. You looked up, smiling nervously at him. He hummed, looking through the book.</p><p>\u201cYN?\u201d He asked, and you nodded.</p><p>He asked for some ID, and you fished your wallet out, showing him your drivers license. He took it in his hands, checking your age and the card. He nodded, before taking down your details. You told him your address and phone number. You began to take your card out, but your friend stopped you, paying it for you. </p><p>\u201cYou were drunk, there\u2019s no need to pay.\u201d You smiled at her, and she laughed in reply. The man gave her the receipt. </p><p>He took a black pen and ticked you off the list and wrote your details on the client information list, and said that another client will finish in 5 minutes. He offered some water, to which you both declined politely. He went into the room in the middle, and didn\u2019t come back out until 5 minutes later. </p><p>\u201cYou can go now, is your friend coming with you?\u201d He questioned, awaiting a reply.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah, yeah, she\u2019s coming.\u201d You said, grabbing her hand and walking into the middle room.</p><p>The room was dimly lit, the walls painted black. The tattoo artist was facing away from you, probably cleaning up. The man was wearing a tight, black polo shirt, that enhanced his back muscles, wide shoulders and the sleeves cupped around his bisceps. He had dark brown hair, styled in a gorgeous undercut. He was heavily tattooed, designs all up his arms, neck, and as he bent down, you could see more tattoos leading to his back (as his shirt rode up). </p><p>\u201cYou can sit down on the chair, I\u2019ll be there in a few secs.\u201d He spoke, in a deep and calming voice. </p><p>You obeyed what he said, sitting on the cushioned chair. Your friend noticed that you were fidgety and nervous, and so she laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking this better than I thought. Do you wanna see the design, will it make you feel better?\u201d </p><p>You nodded your head, twisting your fingers. Your friend unlocked her phone, scrolling through her camera roll. You saw her eyes light up when she found the picture. She gave her phone to you, and you scanned the design. </p><p>You smiled, feeling better that you weren\u2019t going to get some tattoo with her name on your wrist. You could hear the man roll his chair toward you, so you gave the phone back to your friend. You adjusted yourself so you were facing the man, when you felt yourself freeze. Your eyes widened, and you felt your breath hitch in your throat. It was as if time had stopped, and the only thing moving was your heart beating rapidly. The man did the exact same, opening his mouth slightly in shock. You could hear your friend speak in the background, but you weren\u2019t listening, and you were sure that he wasn\u2019t listening either. </p><p><i>Jeon Jungkook.</i></p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Your friend repeated, \u201cThis is the design.\u201d </p><p>Jungkook whipped his head toward your friend, taking the phone into his large hands. He cleared his throat, before grabbing the right equipment. Jungkook took your wrist in his hands, and you could feel the latex of his gloves. Your hand trembled slightly, and he looked up at you. You looked away from him, and you felt very uncomfortable with your friend in the room. He took out a wipe, that was doused in rubbing alcohol. He hesitated, but eventually, cold material touched your skin, cleaning it. Although you were doing the tattoo on the inside of your wrist, the tiniest hairs would cause a problem, so he took any stray hairs off with a disposable razor. While Jungkook went to make the stencil, you talked to your friend, \u201cActually, you can wait outside, I\u2019m not that scared anymore.\u201d You saw Jungkook\u2019s ears perk up from the corner of your eye.</p><p>Your friend patted you on the back, walking out of the room. Jungkook places the stencil on your wrist, dampening it with some soapy water, so the design would print onto your wrist. You saw the purple design on your wrist, as Jungkook began preparing the ink equipment, sterilising them. He rubbed a little ointment over your design, probably so that it wouldn\u2019t rub off, and for a smoother surface for the inky needle to slide across. You watched him start the pen, and the whirring sound floated to your ears. Your heart was beating fast, and your palms grew clammy, but not because of the tattoo. Because of Jungkook. The pain of the tattoo was the last of your problems. </p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d You spoke, voice slightly cracking. </p><p>Jungkook lifted the pen off of your skin, still looking down, \u201cNow\u2019s not the time.\u201d He carried on, making the black outline. </p><p>You weren\u2019t giving up so easily, this could be the only time he\u2019d speak to you, \u201cPlease, why\u2019d you leave? I thought  we had something?\u201d You said, trying not to burst into tears. </p><p>Jungkook began shading in the tattoo with the same colours as the picture he was shown, an orange ombr\u00e9. You saw him switch the needles to magnums, and began to colour it in. He gulped, colouring it in. </p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I left.\u201d </p><p>You laughed slightly, eyes glossing over with tears, \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>Jungkoook stayed silent, blowing on the tattoo, and applying some ointment. He applied a bandage over it, and began talking to you about the after care procedure, giving you a leaflet on it too. He barely looked up at you this whole day, except when he first saw you. You were hoping he\u2019d look at you, but he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play with the bandage, it\u2019s there so it doesn\u2019t get infected. After two hours, you can take it off. Once you\u2019ve taken it off, wash it under warm water with some antibacterial soap, just use your hands. Don\u2019t rub the tattoo, just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dodge the question, Jungkook.\u201d You said, sternly. </p><p>He sighed again, continuing with his talk, \u201cJust pat it dry. Don\u2019t swim. If there are any scabs, use a warm towel to soften them and they\u2019ll come off.\u201d You scoffed, feeling the tears drop down your face. He was just acting like he didn\u2019t know you.</p><p>\u201cPut some sunscreen on, just as you normally would, over the tattoo. And that\u2019s it. You can head back to reception and show it to your friend now.\u201d He said, tidying his desk. You began to sob, looking at the blurry picture of your tattoo of a sunset. He could hear you, and he looked up at you. He felt his heart break, and his eyes softened. He sighed, taking a tissue and passing it to you. You turned away however, walking to the door, using your other sleeve to wipe them away. Jungkook walked behind you, holding your shoulder. He turned you so you faced him, seeing your puffy, red eyes. You sniffled, as you let out another sob. He scrunched the tissue up a little bit, wiping your tears. </p><p>\u201cI left because I liked you. If I stayed, I knew I\u2019d treat you like shit, but I was scared, and too much of a coward to even try be nice to you.\u201d </p><p>You looked up, taking the tissue from his hands, \u201cBut you were nice to me, you-\u201c you spoke, as he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I ignored you at school, I ignored you outside, all because I didn\u2019t want to lose my reputation as \u2018<i>bad boy Jungkook, who gets all the girls</i>\u2019, I was so stupid. I was embarrassed being with you. Heck, I even ignored you here, and your friend doesn\u2019t even know me!\u201d He said sitting back down in his chair, but making eye contact with you. You saw his eyes water too.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I didn\u2019t mind!\u201d You said, walking closer to him.</p><p>\u201cBut <i>I</i> did. I didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed, but I was. No one should treat you like that.\u201d He said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I hate you for leaving me without even telling. But, I can\u2019t hate you forever. Seeing you today, I just\u2026 It\u2019s coming back. All my feelings.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYN, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s been years, you\u2019ve got to forget about us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat we had, was special, Jungkook. You knew that. You were embarrassed, but it was nothing like you had with the other girls. Can\u2019t we try again?\u201d You pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYN, I think you should leave now.\u201d He said, turning away from you. </p><p>\u201cI knew I recognised those drawings. You used to draw them on me, with pens, when I came over. You\u2019d do them with different colours too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYN, please, stop.\u201d He said, feeling overwhelmed but he memories he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cI used to come to your apartment all the time, and we\u2019d play games. You\u2019d get really competitive over Overwatch. Sometimes, when we weren\u2019t in the mood to do anything, we\u2019d just lie in bed, and sleep. Other times, we\u2019d go out, and eat lots of food. I miss that, don\u2019t you?\u201d You asked.</p><p>Jungkook stayed silent, and you realised that maybe he was right. Maybe you did need to let go, and forget about what you had. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll-\u201c You said, opening the door to exit. </p><p>\u201cI did. I missed you a lot. I never had another girlfriend after you.\u201d You stopped in your tracks, turning around to see Jungkook standing behind you. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d You said, pushing the door closed. </p><p>Jungkook shook his head, his brown orbs staring into yours. You observed his face, nothing much changed, except a few things. He had certainly become more handsome. He styled his hair much better. He had various piercings on his ears. You could see the colourful tattoos crawl up his neck. He still had his doe-eyes, that you could melt in. He still cared for you, even if he showed it with some hesitance. He was still Jungkook. You hugged Jungkook, careful of your arm, resting your head against his shoulder. He hugged you too, wrapping his arms around your waist. He lifted your head up, looking into your eyes before kissing you. You felt his plump lips against yours, and you definitely missed it. Your hands interlocked, as he began to deepen the kiss, but then he stopped. You were confused, you thought he wanted this. He walked a few steps back, a pained look in his face. </p><p>\u201cYN, I can\u2019t, I really can\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cJungkook, it\u2019s okay, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, YN. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, YN, I can\u2019t. I, uh..\u201d </p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows, \u201cWhat is it Jungkook?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know you have a kid.\u201d</p><p>You closed your eyes, covering your face with your hands, before taking them down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your kid, Jungkook. He\u2019s your son. I.. I don\u2019t understand, how did you..?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy friend told me. I\u2019m sorry, but, I can\u2019t look after a kid.\u201d You scoffed, raising your eyebrows. You were annoyed, he did this to you, and he\u2019s just leaving you\u2014 again. </p><p>\u201cAnd you think I can? It\u2019s so hard looking after a 4 year old boy, by myself, and I\u2019m not home half the time because of work! And you say that you can\u2019t look after a kid? This was your doing Jungkook, you said it was okay. How did you think I felt?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d A knock on the door interrupted what you were going to say, \u201cYN, why is it taking so long? It wasn\u2019t that hard, was it? Are you okay?\u201d You cleared your throat, replying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m coming now.\u201d </p><p>You opened the door, walking out. You showed your friend the tattoo, and she was really impressed at how the ombr\u00e9 turned out. You glanced at Jungkook, who was looking everywhere in the room, but you. He shoved his hands in the pockets of his jeans, staring at the ground. The other tattoo artists came out, whispering, \u2018<i>Hey, wasn\u2019t that your girlfriend? The one you were telling us?</i>\u2019 You looked at Jungkook\u2019s reaction. He just walked back inside the room, not uttering a word. You and your friend waved goodbye to the others. </p><p>\u201cThanks, we\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d Your friend yelled, exiting the building.</p><p>When you got into the car, you spoke to your friend, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018<i>we\u2019ll be back soon</i>\u2019?\u201d </p><p>She laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re obviously going to get drunk again.\u201d </p><p>For a few minutes it was silent, and then you spoke up. </p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you I was in a relationship? But he left, suddenly?\u201d </p><p>You saw your friend nod her head, urging you to carry on. \u201cHe was the tattoo artist.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat? It was him? Is that why you asked me to go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I needed to sort things out with him. I\u2026 missed him, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJeez, what\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that he was embarrassed, and he\u2019s sorry. I thought we were going to start again, because he kissed me. But his friend told him about Junseok, and he doesn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. Something about not being able to look after a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck? After it was his doing? YN, I\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t help you. But, you and Junseok are fine together, you have me if you need any help, you know that. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll find someone who\u2019ll look after you and Junseok, unlike him.\u201d You nodded at her comment. You almost reached home, when you felt your phone buzz in your side bag. You pulled it out, seeing a message. </p><p><b>From: xx-xxxx-xxxxx</b></p><p><i>hey it\u2019s jungkook i got your number off the client list. I\u2019m really sorry yn. i really am. what i said was wrong, really wrong. what\u2019s his name? can i maybe see him one day, if that\u2019s okay?</i></p><p><b>To: Jungkook</b></p><p><i>yes. what you said was wrong, i went through all of that by myself, and heck, i don\u2019t even know what i\u2019m doing. but junseok needs a father in his life so it might as well be you. i\u2019ll think about it and text you back</i></p><p>He replied with a<i> \u2018thanks yn i really appreciate it\u2019 </i>and you turned your phone off.</p></p>",

The light hit your eyelids, causing you to rub them, and open them. You faced away from the sunlight, and your eyes were adjusting to the brightness. A good nights sleep, without any distractions. You stretched your arms and legs out, feeling much better. You reached out for your phone, looking at all the messages from your best friend.</p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>YN!!!! It\u2019s tattoo dayyyyy</i></p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>You better be up by 11 we don\u2019t wanna be late. we can pick him up from Grace\u2019s after you get the tattoo done. I can\u2019t wait to see his reaction omg</i></p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>I\u2019m so excited!!! You should get drunk more often I love it when you say stupid things and can\u2019t get out of it</i></p><p>Your eyes squinted at the messages, and then the time. It showed 10:30am, which meant you had 30 minutes to get ready. You rolled your eyes, before leaping out of bed, goosebumps on your body from the lack of warmth from under the duvet. You groaned, as you walked into the bathroom, freshening up and brushing your teeth. You jumped down the stairs, preparing yourself breakfast. You took out a bowl, pouring some milk into it. You then added the crunchy cereal, before taking a banana from the fruit bowl. You sat down with your food, spooning the cereal into your mouth, until it was all gone. You unlocked your phone, smiling at your wallpaper, and scrolled through your social media, nibbling on your banana whilst keeping an eye on the time. When the clock hit 10:45am, you placed the bowl and spoon into the dishwasher, and the banana peel in the food waste bin, before jogging back up the stairs to get ready. </p><p>You opened your closet, browsing through your clothes. You picked out a grey, fuzzy jumper and a pair of blue jeans. You changed into your outfit, slipping your socks onto you feet. You then sat down in front of your vanity, brushing your hair out, freeing any knots and tangles. You threw it up in a high ponytail, securing it with a neutral coloured hair tie. You put some moisturiser onto your face, applying some subtle makeup. The misty, pink perfume bottle that stood on your desk was picked up. You spritzed it over yourself, before packing your small side bag. You put your wallet and keys in there, as well as a packet of tissues. You then checked your phone, to find that you were right on time. You headed downstairs, waiting for your best friend to ring the bell. Shortly after, the bell rang and you opened the door. She smiled at you widely, while you rolled your eyes. She dragged you to the car, and you put your seatbelt on, waiting for her to drive to the tattoo shop. </p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t even remember saying that I\u2019d get a tattoo, I don\u2019t want one, remember?\u201d You exclaimed, looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t, you were drunk! But, you definitely said that you were going to get a tattoo, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Your friend said, trying to find a parking space.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, I thought you were joking! You know tattoos hurt?\u201d You said, slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I have three, they\u2019re not that bad. I found a design for you, it\u2019s small and simple, just how you\u2019d like it. I\u2019ve got you, don\u2019t worry!\u201d </p><p>Finally, an empty spot was found for your best friend to park her car. You stayed seated, while she opened the door. You poured crossing your arms, looking away. You could hear your friend laugh, and tug at your arm. She managed to pull you out, and started to lug you all the way to the tattoo shop. The shop\u2019s name was<i> \u2018Ink Me Up\u2019 </i>and you tilted your head. You stood outside the black, graffitied shop, reacting with an, \u2018<i>uh\u2026\u2019 </i>in confusion. Your best friend gave you a reassuring look, before opening the door and calling out for an employee. While she waited for someone to come, you scanned the room. It smelt of cigarettes, and alcohol. It was strong, but a few windows were open for ventilation. </p><p>The room was dark, posters and even more graffiti were on the inside. You saw three rooms, suggesting that there were three tattoo artists. There was also a room that had a sign saying, \u2018store\u2019 which is probably where they kept all the ink and equipment. There was a small couch for clients to sit. On top of the coffee table was a book of tattoo designs, and as you flicked through them, you couldn\u2019t help but open your mouth in awe at how detailed the drawings are. The place was rather quiet, the doors were shut but you could still hear the muffled conversations between the client and artist and the whirring of the ink pen. Out of the store room, came a rather short man, with a few tattoos across his arms. He had a metal lip piercing, which he fiddled with using his tongue. He also had lots of piercings on his ear, his double helix intriguing you the most. He brushed his dark hair out of the way, walking behind the counter. Your friend smiled at him, but you couldn\u2019t see him smile back.</p><p>\u201cHey, I booked an appointment for my friend here to get a tattoo.\u201d She said, pointing at you. </p><p>You were still flicking through the book, when you felt his eyes glaring against you. You looked up, smiling nervously at him. He hummed, looking through the book.</p><p>\u201cYN?\u201d He asked, and you nodded.</p><p>He asked for some ID, and you fished your wallet out, showing him your drivers license. He took it in his hands, checking your age and the card. He nodded, before taking down your details. You told him your address and phone number. You began to take your card out, but your friend stopped you, paying it for you. </p><p>\u201cYou were drunk, there\u2019s no need to pay.\u201d You smiled at her, and she laughed in reply. The man gave her the receipt. </p><p>He took a black pen and ticked you off the list and wrote your details on the client information list, and said that another client will finish in 5 minutes. He offered some water, to which you both declined politely. He went into the room in the middle, and didn\u2019t come back out until 5 minutes later. </p><p>\u201cYou can go now, is your friend coming with you?\u201d He questioned, awaiting a reply.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah, yeah, she\u2019s coming.\u201d You said, grabbing her hand and walking into the middle room.</p><p>The room was dimly lit, the walls painted black. The tattoo artist was facing away from you, probably cleaning up. The man was wearing a tight, black polo shirt, that enhanced his back muscles, wide shoulders and the sleeves cupped around his bisceps. He had dark brown hair, styled in a gorgeous undercut. He was heavily tattooed, designs all up his arms, neck, and as he bent down, you could see more tattoos leading to his back (as his shirt rode up). </p><p>\u201cYou can sit down on the chair, I\u2019ll be there in a few secs.\u201d He spoke, in a deep and calming voice. </p><p>You obeyed what he said, sitting on the cushioned chair. Your friend noticed that you were fidgety and nervous, and so she laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking this better than I thought. Do you wanna see the design, will it make you feel better?\u201d </p><p>You nodded your head, twisting your fingers. Your friend unlocked her phone, scrolling through her camera roll. You saw her eyes light up when she found the picture. She gave her phone to you, and you scanned the design. </p><p>You smiled, feeling better that you weren\u2019t going to get some tattoo with her name on your wrist. You could hear the man roll his chair toward you, so you gave the phone back to your friend. You adjusted yourself so you were facing the man, when you felt yourself freeze. Your eyes widened, and you felt your breath hitch in your throat. It was as if time had stopped, and the only thing moving was your heart beating rapidly. The man did the exact same, opening his mouth slightly in shock. You could hear your friend speak in the background, but you weren\u2019t listening, and you were sure that he wasn\u2019t listening either. </p><p><i>Jeon Jungkook.</i></p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Your friend repeated, \u201cThis is the design.\u201d </p><p>Jungkook whipped his head toward your friend, taking the phone into his large hands. He cleared his throat, before grabbing the right equipment. Jungkook took your wrist in his hands, and you could feel the latex of his gloves. Your hand trembled slightly, and he looked up at you. You looked away from him, and you felt very uncomfortable with your friend in the room. He took out a wipe, that was doused in rubbing alcohol. He hesitated, but eventually, cold material touched your skin, cleaning it. Although you were doing the tattoo on the inside of your wrist, the tiniest hairs would cause a problem, so he took any stray hairs off with a disposable razor. While Jungkook went to make the stencil, you talked to your friend, \u201cActually, you can wait outside, I\u2019m not that scared anymore.\u201d You saw Jungkook\u2019s ears perk up from the corner of your eye.</p><p>Your friend patted you on the back, walking out of the room. Jungkook places the stencil on your wrist, dampening it with some soapy water, so the design would print onto your wrist. You saw the purple design on your wrist, as Jungkook began preparing the ink equipment, sterilising them. He rubbed a little ointment over your design, probably so that it wouldn\u2019t rub off, and for a smoother surface for the inky needle to slide across. You watched him start the pen, and the whirring sound floated to your ears. Your heart was beating fast, and your palms grew clammy, but not because of the tattoo. Because of Jungkook. The pain of the tattoo was the last of your problems. </p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d You spoke, voice slightly cracking. </p><p>Jungkook lifted the pen off of your skin, still looking down, \u201cNow\u2019s not the time.\u201d He carried on, making the black outline. </p><p>You weren\u2019t giving up so easily, this could be the only time he\u2019d speak to you, \u201cPlease, why\u2019d you leave? I thought  we had something?\u201d You said, trying not to burst into tears. </p><p>Jungkook began shading in the tattoo with the same colours as the picture he was shown, an orange ombr\u00e9. You saw him switch the needles to magnums, and began to colour it in. He gulped, colouring it in. </p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I left.\u201d </p><p>You laughed slightly, eyes glossing over with tears, \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>Jungkoook stayed silent, blowing on the tattoo, and applying some ointment. He applied a bandage over it, and began talking to you about the after care procedure, giving you a leaflet on it too. He barely looked up at you this whole day, except when he first saw you. You were hoping he\u2019d look at you, but he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play with the bandage, it\u2019s there so it doesn\u2019t get infected. After two hours, you can take it off. Once you\u2019ve taken it off, wash it under warm water with some antibacterial soap, just use your hands. Don\u2019t rub the tattoo, just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dodge the question, Jungkook.\u201d You said, sternly. </p><p>He sighed again, continuing with his talk, \u201cJust pat it dry. Don\u2019t swim. If there are any scabs, use a warm towel to soften them and they\u2019ll come off.\u201d You scoffed, feeling the tears drop down your face. He was just acting like he didn\u2019t know you.</p><p>\u201cPut some sunscreen on, just as you normally would, over the tattoo. And that\u2019s it. You can head back to reception and show it to your friend now.\u201d He said, tidying his desk. You began to sob, looking at the blurry picture of your tattoo of a sunset. He could hear you, and he looked up at you. He felt his heart break, and his eyes softened. He sighed, taking a tissue and passing it to you. You turned away however, walking to the door, using your other sleeve to wipe them away. Jungkook walked behind you, holding your shoulder. He turned you so you faced him, seeing your puffy, red eyes. You sniffled, as you let out another sob. He scrunched the tissue up a little bit, wiping your tears. </p><p>\u201cI left because I liked you. If I stayed, I knew I\u2019d treat you like shit, but I was scared, and too much of a coward to even try be nice to you.\u201d </p><p>You looked up, taking the tissue from his hands, \u201cBut you were nice to me, you-\u201c you spoke, as he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I ignored you at school, I ignored you outside, all because I didn\u2019t want to lose my reputation as \u2018<i>bad boy Jungkook, who gets all the girls</i>\u2019, I was so stupid. I was embarrassed being with you. Heck, I even ignored you here, and your friend doesn\u2019t even know me!\u201d He said sitting back down in his chair, but making eye contact with you. You saw his eyes water too.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I didn\u2019t mind!\u201d You said, walking closer to him.</p><p>\u201cBut <i>I</i> did. I didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed, but I was. No one should treat you like that.\u201d He said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I hate you for leaving me without even telling. But, I can\u2019t hate you forever. Seeing you today, I just\u2026 It\u2019s coming back. All my feelings.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYN, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s been years, you\u2019ve got to forget about us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat we had, was special, Jungkook. You knew that. You were embarrassed, but it was nothing like you had with the other girls. Can\u2019t we try again?\u201d You pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYN, I think you should leave now.\u201d He said, turning away from you. </p><p>\u201cI knew I recognised those drawings. You used to draw them on me, with pens, when I came over. You\u2019d do them with different colours too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYN, please, stop.\u201d He said, feeling overwhelmed but he memories he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cI used to come to your apartment all the time, and we\u2019d play games. You\u2019d get really competitive over Overwatch. Sometimes, when we weren\u2019t in the mood to do anything, we\u2019d just lie in bed, and sleep. Other times, we\u2019d go out, and eat lots of food. I miss that, don\u2019t you?\u201d You asked.</p><p>Jungkook stayed silent, and you realised that maybe he was right. Maybe you did need to let go, and forget about what you had. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll-\u201c You said, opening the door to exit. </p><p>\u201cI did. I missed you a lot. I never had another girlfriend after you.\u201d You stopped in your tracks, turning around to see Jungkook standing behind you. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d You said, pushing the door closed. </p><p>Jungkook shook his head, his brown orbs staring into yours. You observed his face, nothing much changed, except a few things. He had certainly become more handsome. He styled his hair much better. He had various piercings on his ears. You could see the colourful tattoos crawl up his neck. He still had his doe-eyes, that you could melt in. He still cared for you, even if he showed it with some hesitance. He was still Jungkook. You hugged Jungkook, careful of your arm, resting your head against his shoulder. He hugged you too, wrapping his arms around your waist. He lifted your head up, looking into your eyes before kissing you. You felt his plump lips against yours, and you definitely missed it. Your hands interlocked, as he began to deepen the kiss, but then he stopped. You were confused, you thought he wanted this. He walked a few steps back, a pained look in his face. </p><p>\u201cYN, I can\u2019t, I really can\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cJungkook, it\u2019s okay, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, YN. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, YN, I can\u2019t. I, uh..\u201d </p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows, \u201cWhat is it Jungkook?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know you have a kid.\u201d</p><p>You closed your eyes, covering your face with your hands, before taking them down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your kid, Jungkook. He\u2019s your son. I.. I don\u2019t understand, how did you..?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy friend told me. I\u2019m sorry, but, I can\u2019t look after a kid.\u201d You scoffed, raising your eyebrows. You were annoyed, he did this to you, and he\u2019s just leaving you\u2014 again. </p><p>\u201cAnd you think I can? It\u2019s so hard looking after a 4 year old boy, by myself, and I\u2019m not home half the time because of work! And you say that you can\u2019t look after a kid? This was your doing Jungkook, you said it was okay. How did you think I felt?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d A knock on the door interrupted what you were going to say, \u201cYN, why is it taking so long? It wasn\u2019t that hard, was it? Are you okay?\u201d You cleared your throat, replying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m coming now.\u201d </p><p>You opened the door, walking out. You showed your friend the tattoo, and she was really impressed at how the ombr\u00e9 turned out. You glanced at Jungkook, who was looking everywhere in the room, but you. He shoved his hands in the pockets of his jeans, staring at the ground. The other tattoo artists came out, whispering, \u2018<i>Hey, wasn\u2019t that your girlfriend? The one you were telling us?</i>\u2019 You looked at Jungkook\u2019s reaction. He just walked back inside the room, not uttering a word. You and your friend waved goodbye to the others. </p><p>\u201cThanks, we\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d Your friend yelled, exiting the building.</p><p>When you got into the car, you spoke to your friend, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018<i>we\u2019ll be back soon</i>\u2019?\u201d </p><p>She laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re obviously going to get drunk again.\u201d </p><p>For a few minutes it was silent, and then you spoke up. </p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you I was in a relationship? But he left, suddenly?\u201d </p><p>You saw your friend nod her head, urging you to carry on. \u201cHe was the tattoo artist.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat? It was him? Is that why you asked me to go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I needed to sort things out with him. I\u2026 missed him, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJeez, what\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that he was embarrassed, and he\u2019s sorry. I thought we were going to start again, because he kissed me. But his friend told him about Junseok, and he doesn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. Something about not being able to look after a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck? After it was his doing? YN, I\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t help you. But, you and Junseok are fine together, you have me if you need any help, you know that. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll find someone who\u2019ll look after you and Junseok, unlike him.\u201d You nodded at her comment. You almost reached home, when you felt your phone buzz in your side bag. You pulled it out, seeing a message. </p><p><b>From: xx-xxxx-xxxxx</b></p><p><i>hey it\u2019s jungkook i got your number off the client list. I\u2019m really sorry yn. i really am. what i said was wrong, really wrong. what\u2019s his name? can i maybe see him one day, if that\u2019s okay?</i></p><p><b>To: Jungkook</b></p><p><i>yes. what you said was wrong, i went through all of that by myself, and heck, i don\u2019t even know what i\u2019m doing. but junseok needs a father in his life so it might as well be you. i\u2019ll think about it and text you back</i></p><p>He replied with a<i> \u2018thanks yn i really appreciate it\u2019 </i>and you turned your phone off.</p></p>",

The light hit your eyelids, causing you to rub them, and open them. You faced away from the sunlight, and your eyes were adjusting to the brightness. A good nights sleep, without any distractions. You stretched your arms and legs out, feeling much better. You reached out for your phone, looking at all the messages from your best friend.</p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>YN!!!! It&rsquo;s tattoo dayyyyy</i></p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>You better be up by 11 we don&rsquo;t wanna be late. we can pick him up from Grace&rsquo;s after you get the tattoo done. I can&rsquo;t wait to see his reaction omg</i></p><p><b>From Best Friend:</b></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m so excited!!! You should get drunk more often I love it when you say stupid things and can&rsquo;t get out of it</i></p><p>Your eyes squinted at the messages, and then the time. It showed 10:30am, which meant you had 30 minutes to get ready. You rolled your eyes, before leaping out of bed, goosebumps on your body from the lack of warmth from under the duvet. You groaned, as you walked into the bathroom, freshening up and brushing your teeth. You jumped down the stairs, preparing yourself breakfast. You took out a bowl, pouring some milk into it. You then added the crunchy cereal, before taking a banana from the fruit bowl. You sat down with your food, spooning the cereal into your mouth, until it was all gone. You unlocked your phone, smiling at your wallpaper, and scrolled through your social media, nibbling on your banana whilst keeping an eye on the time. When the clock hit 10:45am, you placed the bowl and spoon into the dishwasher, and the banana peel in the food waste bin, before jogging back up the stairs to get ready. </p><p>You opened your closet, browsing through your clothes. You picked out a grey, fuzzy jumper and a pair of blue jeans. You changed into your outfit, slipping your socks onto you feet. You then sat down in front of your vanity, brushing your hair out, freeing any knots and tangles. You threw it up in a high ponytail, securing it with a neutral coloured hair tie. You put some moisturiser onto your face, applying some subtle makeup. The misty, pink perfume bottle that stood on your desk was picked up. You spritzed it over yourself, before packing your small side bag. You put your wallet and keys in there, as well as a packet of tissues. You then checked your phone, to find that you were right on time. You headed downstairs, waiting for your best friend to ring the bell. Shortly after, the bell rang and you opened the door. She smiled at you widely, while you rolled your eyes. She dragged you to the car, and you put your seatbelt on, waiting for her to drive to the tattoo shop. </p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t even remember saying that I&rsquo;d get a tattoo, I don&rsquo;t want one, remember?&rdquo; You exclaimed, looking out the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t, you were drunk! But, you definitely said that you were going to get a tattoo, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; Your friend said, trying to find a parking space.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, I thought you were joking!

I found a design for you, it&rsquo;s small and simple, just how you&rsquo;d like it.

You poured crossing your arms, looking away. You could hear your friend laugh, and tug at your arm. She managed to pull you out, and started to lug you all the way to the tattoo shop. The shop&rsquo;s name was<i> &lsquo;Ink Me Up&rsquo; </i>and you tilted your head. You stood outside the black, graffitied shop, reacting with an, &lsquo;<i>uh&hellip;&rsquo; </i>in confusion. Your best friend gave you a reassuring look, before opening the door and calling out for an employee. While she waited for someone to come, you scanned the room. It smelt of cigarettes, and alcohol.

He also had lots of piercings on his ear, his double helix intriguing you the most. He brushed his dark hair out of the way, walking behind the counter. Your friend smiled at him, but you couldn&rsquo;t see him smile back.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I booked an appointment for my friend here to get a tattoo.&rdquo; She said, pointing at you. </p><p>You were still flicking through the book, when you felt his eyes glaring against you. You looked up, smiling nervously at him.

He cleared his throat, before grabbing the right equipment. Jungkook took your wrist in his hands, and you could feel the latex of his gloves. Your hand trembled slightly, and he looked up at you.

While Jungkook went to make the stencil, you talked to your friend, &ldquo;Actually, you can wait outside, I&rsquo;m not that scared anymore.&rdquo; You saw Jungkook&rsquo;s ears perk up from the corner of your eye.</p><p>Your friend patted you on the back, walking out of the room. Jungkook places the stencil on your wrist, dampening it with some soapy water, so the design would print onto your wrist. You saw the purple design on your wrist, as Jungkook began preparing the ink equipment, sterilising them. He rubbed a little ointment over your design, probably so that it wouldn&rsquo;t rub off, and for a smoother surface for the inky needle to slide across. You watched him start the pen, and the whirring sound floated to your ears. Your heart was beating fast, and your palms grew clammy, but not because of the tattoo. Because of Jungkook. The pain of the tattoo was the last of your problems. </p><p>&ldquo;Why did you leave?&rdquo; You spoke, voice slightly cracking. </p><p>Jungkook lifted the pen off of your skin, still looking down, &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s not the time.&rdquo; He carried on, making the black outline. </p><p>You weren&rsquo;t giving up so easily, this could be the only time he&rsquo;d speak to you, &ldquo;Please, why&rsquo;d you leave? I thought  we had something?&rdquo; You said, trying not to burst into tears. </p><p>Jungkook began shading in the tattoo with the same colours as the picture he was shown, an orange ombr&eacute;. You saw him switch the needles to magnums, and began to colour it in. He gulped, colouring it in. </p><p>&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s why I left.&rdquo; </p><p>You laughed slightly, eyes glossing over with tears, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>Jungkoook stayed silent, blowing on the tattoo, and applying some ointment. He applied a bandage over it, and began talking to you about the after care procedure, giving you a leaflet on it too. He barely looked up at you this whole day, except when he first saw you. You were hoping he&rsquo;d look at you, but he didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play with the bandage, it&rsquo;s there so it doesn&rsquo;t get infected. After two hours, you can take it off. Once you&rsquo;ve taken it off, wash it under warm water with some antibacterial soap, just use your hands. Don&rsquo;t rub the tattoo, just-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dodge the question, Jungkook.&rdquo; You said, sternly. </p><p>He sighed again, continuing with his talk, &ldquo;Just pat it dry. Don&rsquo;t swim. If there are any scabs, use a warm towel to soften them and they&rsquo;ll come off.&rdquo; You scoffed, feeling the tears drop down your face. He was just acting like he didn&rsquo;t know you.</p><p>&ldquo;Put some sunscreen on, just as you normally would, over the tattoo. And that&rsquo;s it. You can head back to reception and show it to your friend now.&rdquo; He said, tidying his desk. You began to sob, looking at the blurry picture of your tattoo of a sunset. He could hear you, and he looked up at you. He felt his heart break, and his eyes softened. He sighed, taking a tissue and passing it to you. You turned away however, walking to the door, using your other sleeve to wipe them away. Jungkook walked behind you, holding your shoulder. He turned you so you faced him, seeing your puffy, red eyes. You sniffled, as you let out another sob. He scrunched the tissue up a little bit, wiping your tears. </p><p>&ldquo;I left because I liked you. If I stayed, I knew I&rsquo;d treat you like shit, but I was scared, and too much of a coward to even try be nice to you.&rdquo; </p><p>You looked up, taking the tissue from his hands, &ldquo;But you were nice to me, you-&ldquo; you spoke, as he interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t. I ignored you at school, I ignored you outside, all because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose my reputation as &lsquo;<i>bad boy Jungkook, who gets all the girls</i>&rsquo;, I was so stupid. I was embarrassed being with you. Heck, I even ignored you here, and your friend doesn&rsquo;t even know me!&rdquo; He said sitting back down in his chair, but making eye contact with you. You saw his eyes water too.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, I didn&rsquo;t mind!&rdquo; You said, walking closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> did. I didn&rsquo;t want to be embarrassed, but I was. No one should treat you like that.&rdquo; He said, sighing.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, I hate you for leaving me without even telling. But, I can&rsquo;t hate you forever. Seeing you today, I just&hellip; It&rsquo;s coming back. All my feelings.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;YN, you can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s been years, you&rsquo;ve got to forget about us.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What we had, was special, Jungkook. You knew that. You were embarrassed, but it was nothing like you had with the other girls. Can&rsquo;t we try again?&rdquo; You pleaded.</p><p>&ldquo;YN, I think you should leave now.&rdquo; He said, turning away from you. </p><p>&ldquo;I knew I recognised those drawings. You used to draw them on me, with pens, when I came over. You&rsquo;d do them with different colours too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;YN, please, stop.&rdquo; He said, feeling overwhelmed but he memories he was feeling.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to come to your apartment all the time, and we&rsquo;d play games. You&rsquo;d get really competitive over Overwatch. Sometimes, when we weren&rsquo;t in the mood to do anything, we&rsquo;d just lie in bed, and sleep. Other times, we&rsquo;d go out, and eat lots of food. I miss that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>Jungkook stayed silent, and you realised that maybe he was right. Maybe you did need to let go, and forget about what you had. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;ll-&ldquo; You said, opening the door to exit. </p><p>&ldquo;I did. I missed you a lot. I never had another girlfriend after you.&rdquo; You stopped in your tracks, turning around to see Jungkook standing behind you. </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; You said, pushing the door closed. </p><p>Jungkook shook his head, his brown orbs staring into yours. You observed his face, nothing much changed, except a few things. He had certainly become more handsome. He styled his hair much better. He had various piercings on his ears. You could see the colourful tattoos crawl up his neck. He still had his doe-eyes, that you could melt in. He still cared for you, even if he showed it with some hesitance. He was still Jungkook. You hugged Jungkook, careful of your arm, resting your head against his shoulder. He hugged you too, wrapping his arms around your waist. He lifted your head up, looking into your eyes before kissing you. You felt his plump lips against yours, and you definitely missed it. Your hands interlocked, as he began to deepen the kiss, but then he stopped. You were confused, you thought he wanted this. He walked a few steps back, a pained look in his face. </p><p>&ldquo;YN, I can&rsquo;t, I really can&rsquo;t-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, it&rsquo;s okay, I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, YN. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you still embarrassed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, YN, I can&rsquo;t. I, uh..&rdquo; </p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows, &ldquo;What is it Jungkook?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know you have a kid.&rdquo;</p><p>You closed your eyes, covering your face with your hands, before taking them down.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s your kid, Jungkook. He&rsquo;s your son. I.. I don&rsquo;t understand, how did you..?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My friend told me. I&rsquo;m sorry, but, I can&rsquo;t look after a kid.&rdquo; You scoffed, raising your eyebrows. You were annoyed, he did this to you, and he&rsquo;s just leaving you&mdash; again. </p><p>&ldquo;And you think I can? It&rsquo;s so hard looking after a 4 year old boy, by myself, and I&rsquo;m not home half the time because of work! And you say that you can&rsquo;t look after a kid? This was your doing Jungkook, you said it was okay. How did you think I felt?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, okay? I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; A knock on the door interrupted what you were going to say, &ldquo;YN, why is it taking so long? It wasn&rsquo;t that hard, was it? Are you okay?&rdquo; You cleared your throat, replying, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m coming now.&rdquo; </p><p>You opened the door, walking out. You showed your friend the tattoo, and she was really impressed at how the ombr&eacute; turned out. You glanced at Jungkook, who was looking everywhere in the room, but you. He shoved his hands in the pockets of his jeans, staring at the ground. The other tattoo artists came out, whispering, &lsquo;<i>Hey, wasn&rsquo;t that your girlfriend? The one you were telling us?</i>&rsquo; You looked at Jungkook&rsquo;s reaction. He just walked back inside the room, not uttering a word. You and your friend waved goodbye to the others. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, we&rsquo;ll be back soon!&rdquo; Your friend yelled, exiting the building.</p><p>When you got into the car, you spoke to your friend, &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;<i>we&rsquo;ll be back soon</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re obviously going to get drunk again.&rdquo; </p><p>For a few minutes it was silent, and then you spoke up. </p><p>&ldquo;Remember when I told you I was in a relationship? But he left, suddenly?&rdquo; </p><p>You saw your friend nod her head, urging you to carry on. &ldquo;He was the tattoo artist.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What? It was him? Is that why you asked me to go out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I needed to sort things out with him. I&hellip; missed him, you know?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Jeez, what&rsquo;d he say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He said that he was embarrassed, and he&rsquo;s sorry. I thought we were going to start again, because he kissed me. But his friend told him about Junseok, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to be with me anymore. Something about not being able to look after a kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the heck? After it was his doing? YN, I&rsquo;m sorry he didn&rsquo;t help you. But, you and Junseok are fine together, you have me if you need any help, you know that. Who knows, maybe you&rsquo;ll find someone who&rsquo;ll look after you and Junseok, unlike him.&rdquo; You nodded at her comment. You almost reached home, when you felt your phone buzz in your side bag. You pulled it out, seeing a message. </p><p><b>From: xx-xxxx-xxxxx</b></p><p><i>hey it&rsquo;s jungkook i got your number off the client list. I&rsquo;m really sorry yn. i really am. what i said was wrong, really wrong. what&rsquo;s his name? can i maybe see him one day, if that&rsquo;s okay?</i></p><p><b>To: Jungkook</b></p><p><i>yes. what you said was wrong, i went through all of that by myself, and heck, i don&rsquo;t even know what i&rsquo;m doing. but junseok needs a father in his life so it might as well be you. i&rsquo;ll think about it and text you back</i></p><p>He replied with a<i> &lsquo;thanks yn i really appreciate it&rsquo; </i>and you turned your phone off.</p></p>",
