You were sitting on one of the chairs around the table the Evans had in their back deck, admiring the starry sky and lost in thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMa?\u201d, you heard a familiar voice calling from inside and his footsteps growing louder. When he saw there was someone in the deck, he went to check. \u201cY/N? Hi! Have you seen my mom?\u201d, Chris asked.</p><p>\u201cShe went out to have dinner with Shanna. \u00a0She said she\u2019d probably be back in two hours from now\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAlright. Thanks\u201d, he furrowed his brows studying the scene before his eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking\u201d.</p><p>\u201cCare if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t as long as you don\u2019t come empty-handed\u201d, you smirked at him making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cSay no more\u201d, he exclaimed and got inside the house.</p><!-- more --><p>You\u2019ve come to Boston for a period of internship. Not so long after your arrival, you met Chris Evans at a friend\u2019s party and the connection was almost instant. You two became good friends and eventually you befriended his family as well, at the point of spending some weekends in his mother\u2019s house to keep her company at night since all her children had their own places by now. This weekend was one of those.</p><p>\u201cWhy you didn\u2019t go to Shanna\u2019s with my mom?\u201d, Chris had returned to the deck.</p><p>\u201cSomething in your sister said that she needed some time alone with her mother so I prefered to stay. And to be honest I was not in the mood to go out\u201d, you replied right before your eyes landed on what Chris had in his hand. &ldquo;Wine? You\u2019re evolving Evans&rdquo;, you teased him making him chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWho could ever say that I am a Pok\u00e9mon, right?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help, but laugh at that not so funny joke of Chris. \u201cThat explains a lot. Considering how stubborn you are, I\u2019d say you\u2019re a Pikachu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHilarious\u201d, he tried not to laugh.</p><p>Chris sat on a chair across the table and filled your glasses with the sweet red wine he had brought. Having sipped your drinks, you two remained silent for some minutes until Chris noticed that only your body was present there, your mind was travelling far away.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d, he asked calling you back to Earth.</p><p>\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just some things I\u2019ve been feeling since I arrived in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?</p><p>&ldquo;I don\u2019t know if you or another person would believe it or at least understand it\u201d, you toyed sofly with you glass while looking at the stars.</p><p>\u201cListen, it doesn\u2019t matter if I believe it or not. If it\u2019s important to you, it\u2019s important to me as well so I\u2019ll do my best to try to understand whatever it is\u201d, Chris said after placing his hand on your knee to catch your full attention.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d, was all you said before smiling at him and placing you hand on his. Knowing you\u2019d start opening up, both of you positioned yourselves confortably on the chairs. Taking a sip of wine from your glass, you began. </p><p>\u201cActually I always felt this, but since I came here it intensified. I feel like someone, maybe God, is trying to tell me something about where I belong, y'know? Cuz I never felt like I really belonged anywhere and that\u2019s why I love travelling. Every place I go I feel at home for a short period of time and it\u2019s worth it. To be honest, I love that about myself\u201d, you stopped talking for a bit in order to organize your line of thoughts and Chris waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cHowever\u201d, you continued, \u201csomething is different now, here, in Boston. What I feel about the city is the same I did about other ones, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d, you were getting passionate while expressing what you had been keeping to yourself for so long. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m watching my life through a window imagining what comes next and being all excited about whatever it is \u2018cause I know it\u2019s good. Does it make any sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does\u201d, Chris answered before being silent for some seconds as if he was pondering about what to say. \u201cWhat you just described is very similar to what I\u2019ve been feeling for almost a year. Of course in my case I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with cities &lsquo;cause I love Boston, it\u2019s my home. But I feel like I live constantly on the verge of something new and great. Like all was gonna be answered soon, but 'soon\u2019 never comes\u201d.</p><p>He paused and looked at you, empathy in his eyes just like the same you knew you were showing him. Recognizing in his eyes the familiar will of wanting to put everything in your head aside, you just looked at the bottom of your almost empty glass and joked.</p><p>\u201cWow, what you guys put in this one? I\u2019ve never got too philosophical after only two glasses as I do with the wine you serve here\u201d.</p><p>Chris threw his head back and laughed out loud, his hand on his left boob. \u201cWell, it\u2019s like a secret family recipe. I\u2019d have to kill you if I told you\u201d, he managed to say making you laugh as much as him. Obviously, alcohol had worked its way.</p><p>You and Chris spent the rest of the night talking about silly things until Lisa finally came back home. Feeling tired, you hugged her and Chris excusing yourself and headed to Scott\u2019s room, where you used to sleep while staying with Lisa. Crashing on the matress, you fell asleep instantly.</p><p>_______________</p><p><b><i>Late November</i></b></p><p>\u201cHey, what are you up to?\u201d, Chris asked on the other side of the phone.</p><p>\u201cNothing much, just grading some papers\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNice. Will you be busy in the evening today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t planned anything yet. Why you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuz since this year\u2019s will be your first Christmas in Boston I wanted to take you to our typical Faneuil Hall Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh I&rsquo;d love that! I like Christmas lights in general so I say yes\u201d, you replied excitedly and Chris laughed at your reaction.</p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll pick you up at 7 p.m., okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! I\u2019ll be waiting\u201d, you hung up after you both had said your see ya\u2019s.</p><p>Chris and you were closer than ever and because of that a lot of people thought you were more than friends, which was clearly not true. To be honest, you were not sure about what you felt for him. You loved the guy, but you didn\u2019t know if you did it as a friend or something else. Sometimes it seemed like you were dating 'cause you\u2019d do things that only couples do except for the physical/sexual part. When asked about why you did those things, you both answered that it was just a good and strong friendship, which explained why you felt so confortable around each other and, consequently, why you acted (according to some people) in such an intimate way toward one another.</p><p>Chris picked you up at 7 p.m. on the dot and drove you both to Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The square was already crowded so Chris, being the taller one, led you through the sea of people. He finally found a good spot not too close or too far from the tree and then he told you to plant yourself in front of him so you could see everything better. You only had to wait some minutes before the audience started counting down. You and Chris followed and cheered when the lights were on and the tree was completely illuminated. Therefore, the show began and everything was colorful as the tree\u2019s colors changed while 'All I Want For Christmas Is You\u2019 played.</p><p>At the peak of your excitement, you turned your head to face Chris and grinned at him. However, the way he looked at you warmed your heart for some reason. What you didn\u2019t know is that it was different 'cause at that exact moment something had clicked with Chris\u2019s own heart. Seeing you grinning at him and the giant bright tree in the background projecting a kind of halo around your face made Chris finally understand what the great thing he always felt like on the verge of was. You were different from all the other women he had dated before and deep in his soul he always felt that somehow you would be forever in his life. He knew he loved you, but just like you he wasn\u2019t sure how. Now, there was no more doubts for him.</p><p>Your eyes were locked and none of you could break what seemed to be a spell only you two were under. Soon something started clicking with you too. It was like all the fog before your eyes has lifted and everything was so clear. There was no noise in your brain, all the doubts and questions were gone and finally you knew you were where you were meant to be. It\u2019s never been about belonging to a place and at that moment you understood that. It was like all the small and bright trees around you were pointing to Chris, like a natural compass pointing to your personal North. All at once everything looked different now that you were seeing that man standing in front of you, whose lips were slightly apart as if something was sinking in.</p><p>Apparently you both haven\u2019t seen the time pass, but another song was playing now: 'Hallelujah\u2019 by H\u00e4ndel. The song\u2019s strong chords seemed to break the spell you two were under and all you could do was walk towards each other closing the distance between you. With your arms around Chris\u2019s neck, and his around your waist, you smiled and giggled at one another. No words were necessary 'cause your eyes and hearts were speaking a language only you could comprehend.</p><p>\u201cAnd the 'soon\u2019 I was waiting for came in an unexpected way\u201d, Chris said softly touching your foreheads.</p><p>\u201cAnd in an unexpected way I finally found out where my heart belongs to\u201d.</p><p>Chris\u2019s smile widened and he gave you a gentle peck on the nose right before pressing his lips passionately against yours.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DutHO8EwazLU\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/utHO8EwazLU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure><p><i>(Credits to Robert Kearns\u2019s channel on Youtube.

What I feel about the city is the same I did about other ones, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d, you were getting passionate while expressing what you had been keeping to yourself for so long. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m watching my life through a window imagining what comes next and being all excited about whatever it is \u2018cause I know it\u2019s good. Does it make any sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does\u201d, Chris answered before being silent for some seconds as if he was pondering about what to say. \u201cWhat you just described is very similar to what I\u2019ve been feeling for almost a year. Of course in my case I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with cities \u2018cause I love Boston, it\u2019s my home. But I feel like I live constantly on the verge of something new and great. Like all was gonna be answered soon, but 'soon\u2019 never comes\u201d.</p><p>He paused and looked at you, empathy in his eyes just like the same you knew you were showing him. Recognizing in his eyes the familiar will of wanting to put everything in your head aside, you just looked at the bottom of your almost empty glass and joked.</p><p>\u201cWow, what you guys put in this one? I\u2019ve never got too philosophical after only two glasses as I do with the wine you serve here\u201d.</p><p>Chris threw his head back and laughed out loud, his hand on his left boob. \u201cWell, it\u2019s like a secret family recipe. I\u2019d have to kill you if I told you\u201d, he managed to say making you laugh as much as him. Obviously, alcohol had worked its way.</p><p>You and Chris spent the rest of the night talking about silly things until Lisa finally came back home. Feeling tired, you hugged her and Chris excusing yourself and headed to Scott\u2019s room, where you used to sleep while staying with Lisa. Crashing on the matress, you fell asleep instantly.</p><p>_______________</p><p><b><i>Late November</i></b></p><p>\u201cHey, what are you up to?\u201d, Chris asked on the other side of the phone.</p><p>\u201cNothing much, just grading some papers\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNice. Will you be busy in the evening today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t planned anything yet. Why you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuz since this year\u2019s will be your first Christmas in Boston I wanted to take you to our typical Faneuil Hall Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh I\u2019d love that! I like Christmas lights in general so I say yes\u201d, you replied excitedly and Chris laughed at your reaction.</p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll pick you up at 7 p.m., okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! I\u2019ll be waiting\u201d, you hung up after you both had said your see ya\u2019s.</p><p>Chris and you were closer than ever and because of that a lot of people thought you were more than friends, which was clearly not true. To be honest, you were not sure about what you felt for him. You loved the guy, but you didn\u2019t know if you did it as a friend or something else. Sometimes it seemed like you were dating 'cause you\u2019d do things that only couples do except for the physical/sexual part. When asked about why you did those things, you both answered that it was just a good and strong friendship, which explained why you felt so confortable around each other and, consequently, why you acted (according to some people) in such an intimate way toward one another.</p><p>Chris picked you up at 7 p.m. on the dot and drove you both to Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The square was already crowded so Chris, being the taller one, led you through the sea of people. He finally found a good spot not too close or too far from the tree and then he told you to plant yourself in front of him so you could see everything better. You only had to wait some minutes before the audience started counting down. You and Chris followed and cheered when the lights were on and the tree was completely illuminated. Therefore, the show began and everything was colorful as the tree\u2019s colors changed while 'All I Want For Christmas Is You\u2019 played.</p><p>At the peak of your excitement, you turned your head to face Chris and grinned at him. However, the way he looked at you warmed your heart for some reason. What you didn\u2019t know is that it was different 'cause at that exact moment something had clicked with Chris\u2019s own heart. Seeing you grinning at him and the giant bright tree in the background projecting a kind of halo around your face made Chris finally understand what the great thing he always felt like on the verge of was. You were different from all the other women he had dated before and deep in his soul he always felt that somehow you would be forever in his life. He knew he loved you, but just like you he wasn\u2019t sure how. Now, there was no more doubts for him.</p><p>Your eyes were locked and none of you could break what seemed to be a spell only you two were under. Soon something started clicking with you too. It was like all the fog before your eyes has lifted and everything was so clear. There was no noise in your brain, all the doubts and questions were gone and finally you knew you were where you were meant to be. It\u2019s never been about belonging to a place and at that moment you understood that. It was like all the small and bright trees around you were pointing to Chris, like a natural compass pointing to your personal North. All at once everything looked different now that you were seeing that man standing in front of you, whose lips were slightly apart as if something was sinking in.</p><p>Apparently you both haven\u2019t seen the time pass, but another song was playing now: 'Hallelujah\u2019 by H\u00e4ndel. The song\u2019s strong chords seemed to break the spell you two were under and all you could do was walk towards each other closing the distance between you. With your arms around Chris\u2019s neck, and his around your waist, you smiled and giggled at one another. No words were necessary 'cause your eyes and hearts were speaking a language only you could comprehend.</p><p>\u201cAnd the 'soon\u2019 I was waiting for came in an unexpected way\u201d, Chris said softly touching your foreheads.</p><p>\u201cAnd in an unexpected way I finally found out where my heart belongs to\u201d.</p><p>Chris\u2019s smile widened and he gave you a gentle peck on the nose right before pressing his lips passionately against yours.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DutHO8EwazLU\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/utHO8EwazLU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure><p><i>(Credits to Robert Kearns\u2019s channel on Youtube.

You were sitting on one of the chairs around the table the Evans had in their back deck, admiring the starry sky and lost in thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMa?\u201d, you heard a familiar voice calling from inside and his footsteps growing louder. When he saw there was someone in the deck, he went to check. \u201cY/N? Hi! Have you seen my mom?\u201d, Chris asked.</p><p>\u201cShe went out to have dinner with Shanna. \u00a0She said she\u2019d probably be back in two hours from now\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAlright. Thanks\u201d, he furrowed his brows studying the scene before his eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking\u201d.</p><p>\u201cCare if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t as long as you don\u2019t come empty-handed\u201d, you smirked at him making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cSay no more\u201d, he exclaimed and got inside the house.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You\u2019ve come to Boston for a period of internship. Not so long after your arrival, you met Chris Evans at a friend\u2019s party and the connection was almost instant. You two became good friends and eventually you befriended his family as well, at the point of spending some weekends in his mother\u2019s house to keep her company at night since all her children had their own places by now. This weekend was one of those.</p><p>\u201cWhy you didn\u2019t go to Shanna\u2019s with my mom?\u201d, Chris had returned to the deck.</p><p>\u201cSomething in your sister said that she needed some time alone with her mother so I prefered to stay. And to be honest I was not in the mood to go out\u201d, you replied right before your eyes landed on what Chris had in his hand. \u201cWine? You\u2019re evolving Evans\u201d, you teased him making him chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWho could ever say that I am a Pok\u00e9mon, right?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help, but laugh at that not so funny joke of Chris. \u201cThat explains a lot. Considering how stubborn you are, I\u2019d say you\u2019re a Pikachu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHilarious\u201d, he tried not to laugh.</p><p>Chris sat on a chair across the table and filled your glasses with the sweet red wine he had brought. Having sipped your drinks, you two remained silent for some minutes until Chris noticed that only your body was present there, your mind was travelling far away.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d, he asked calling you back to Earth.</p><p>\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just some things I\u2019ve been feeling since I arrived in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you or another person would believe it or at least understand it\u201d, you toyed sofly with you glass while looking at the stars.</p><p>\u201cListen, it doesn\u2019t matter if I believe it or not. If it\u2019s important to you, it\u2019s important to me as well so I\u2019ll do my best to try to understand whatever it is\u201d, Chris said after placing his hand on your knee to catch your full attention.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d, was all you said before smiling at him and placing you hand on his. Knowing you\u2019d start opening up, both of you positioned yourselves confortably on the chairs. Taking a sip of wine from your glass, you began. </p><p>\u201cActually I always felt this, but since I came here it intensified. I feel like someone, maybe God, is trying to tell me something about where I belong, y'know? Cuz I never felt like I really belonged anywhere and that\u2019s why I love travelling. Every place I go I feel at home for a short period of time and it\u2019s worth it. To be honest, I love that about myself\u201d, you stopped talking for a bit in order to organize your line of thoughts and Chris waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cHowever\u201d, you continued, \u201csomething is different now, here, in Boston.

You were sitting on one of the chairs around the table the Evans had in their back deck, admiring the starry sky and lost in thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma?&rdquo;, you heard a familiar voice calling from inside and his footsteps growing louder. When he saw there was someone in the deck, he went to check. &ldquo;Y/N? Hi! Have you seen my mom?&rdquo;, Chris asked.</p><p>&ldquo;She went out to have dinner with Shanna. &nbsp;She said she&rsquo;d probably be back in two hours from now&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Thanks&rdquo;, he furrowed his brows studying the scene before his eyes. &ldquo;What are you doing here alone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just thinking&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Care if I join you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t as long as you don&rsquo;t come empty-handed&rdquo;, you smirked at him making him laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Say no more&rdquo;, he exclaimed and got inside the house.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve come to Boston for a period of internship. Not so long after your arrival, you met Chris Evans at a friend&rsquo;s party and the connection was almost instant. You two became good friends and eventually you befriended his family as well, at the point of spending some weekends in his mother&rsquo;s house to keep her company at night since all her children had their own places by now. This weekend was one of those.</p><p>&ldquo;Why you didn&rsquo;t go to Shanna&rsquo;s with my mom?&rdquo;, Chris had returned to the deck.</p><p>&ldquo;Something in your sister said that she needed some time alone with her mother so I prefered to stay. And to be honest I was not in the mood to go out&rdquo;, you replied right before your eyes landed on what Chris had in his hand. &ldquo;Wine? You&rsquo;re evolving Evans&rdquo;, you teased him making him chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Who could ever say that I am a Pok&eacute;mon, right?&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help, but laugh at that not so funny joke of Chris. &ldquo;That explains a lot. Considering how stubborn you are, I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re a Pikachu.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hilarious&rdquo;, he tried not to laugh.</p><p>Chris sat on a chair across the table and filled your glasses with the sweet red wine he had brought. Having sipped your drinks, you two remained silent for some minutes until Chris noticed that only your body was present there, your mind was travelling far away.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;, he asked calling you back to Earth.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, it&rsquo;s just some things I&rsquo;ve been feeling since I arrived in Boston.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna talk about it?</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you or another person would believe it or at least understand it&rdquo;, you toyed sofly with you glass while looking at the stars.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I believe it or not. If it&rsquo;s important to you, it&rsquo;s important to me as well so I&rsquo;ll do my best to try to understand whatever it is&rdquo;, Chris said after placing his hand on your knee to catch your full attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;, was all you said before smiling at him and placing you hand on his. Knowing you&rsquo;d start opening up, both of you positioned yourselves confortably on the chairs. Taking a sip of wine from your glass, you began. </p><p>&ldquo;Actually I always felt this, but since I came here it intensified. I feel like someone, maybe God, is trying to tell me something about where I belong, y'know? Cuz I never felt like I really belonged anywhere and that&rsquo;s why I love travelling. Every place I go I feel at home for a short period of time and it&rsquo;s worth it. To be honest, I love that about myself&rdquo;, you stopped talking for a bit in order to organize your line of thoughts and Chris waited patiently.</p><p>&ldquo;However&rdquo;, you continued, &ldquo;something is different now, here, in Boston. What I feel about the city is the same I did about other ones, but&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, you were getting passionate while expressing what you had been keeping to yourself for so long. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m watching my life through a window imagining what comes next and being all excited about whatever it is &lsquo;cause I know it&rsquo;s good. Does it make any sense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It does&rdquo;, Chris answered before being silent for some seconds as if he was pondering about what to say. &ldquo;What you just described is very similar to what I&rsquo;ve been feeling for almost a year. Of course in my case I don&rsquo;t think it has anything to do with cities &lsquo;cause I love Boston, it&rsquo;s my home. But I feel like I live constantly on the verge of something new and great. Like all was gonna be answered soon, but 'soon&rsquo; never comes&rdquo;.</p><p>He paused and looked at you, empathy in his eyes just like the same you knew you were showing him. Recognizing in his eyes the familiar will of wanting to put everything in your head aside, you just looked at the bottom of your almost empty glass and joked.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, what you guys put in this one? I&rsquo;ve never got too philosophical after only two glasses as I do with the wine you serve here&rdquo;.</p><p>Chris threw his head back and laughed out loud, his hand on his left boob. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like a secret family recipe. I&rsquo;d have to kill you if I told you&rdquo;, he managed to say making you laugh as much as him. Obviously, alcohol had worked its way.</p><p>You and Chris spent the rest of the night talking about silly things until Lisa finally came back home. Feeling tired, you hugged her and Chris excusing yourself and headed to Scott&rsquo;s room, where you used to sleep while staying with Lisa. Crashing on the matress, you fell asleep instantly.</p><p>_______________</p><p><b><i>Late November</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what are you up to?&rdquo;, Chris asked on the other side of the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing much, just grading some papers&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice. Will you be busy in the evening today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t planned anything yet. Why you asking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cuz since this year&rsquo;s will be your first Christmas in Boston I wanted to take you to our typical Faneuil Hall Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony. What do you say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh I&rsquo;d love that! I like Christmas lights in general so I say yes&rdquo;, you replied excitedly and Chris laughed at your reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll pick you up at 7 p.m., okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure! I&rsquo;ll be waiting&rdquo;, you hung up after you both had said your see ya&rsquo;s.</p><p>Chris and you were closer than ever and because of that a lot of people thought you were more than friends, which was clearly not true. To be honest, you were not sure about what you felt for him. You loved the guy, but you didn&rsquo;t know if you did it as a friend or something else. Sometimes it seemed like you were dating 'cause you&rsquo;d do things that only couples do except for the physical/sexual part. When asked about why you did those things, you both answered that it was just a good and strong friendship, which explained why you felt so confortable around each other and, consequently, why you acted (according to some people) in such an intimate way toward one another.</p><p>Chris picked you up at 7 p.m. on the dot and drove you both to Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The square was already crowded so Chris, being the taller one, led you through the sea of people. He finally found a good spot not too close or too far from the tree and then he told you to plant yourself in front of him so you could see everything better. You only had to wait some minutes before the audience started counting down. You and Chris followed and cheered when the lights were on and the tree was completely illuminated. Therefore, the show began and everything was colorful as the tree&rsquo;s colors changed while 'All I Want For Christmas Is You&rsquo; played.</p><p>At the peak of your excitement, you turned your head to face Chris and grinned at him. However, the way he looked at you warmed your heart for some reason. What you didn&rsquo;t know is that it was different 'cause at that exact moment something had clicked with Chris&rsquo;s own heart. Seeing you grinning at him and the giant bright tree in the background projecting a kind of halo around your face made Chris finally understand what the great thing he always felt like on the verge of was. You were different from all the other women he had dated before and deep in his soul he always felt that somehow you would be forever in his life. He knew he loved you, but just like you he wasn&rsquo;t sure how. Now, there was no more doubts for him.</p><p>Your eyes were locked and none of you could break what seemed to be a spell only you two were under. Soon something started clicking with you too. It was like all the fog before your eyes has lifted and everything was so clear. There was no noise in your brain, all the doubts and questions were gone and finally you knew you were where you were meant to be. It&rsquo;s never been about belonging to a place and at that moment you understood that. It was like all the small and bright trees around you were pointing to Chris, like a natural compass pointing to your personal North. All at once everything looked different now that you were seeing that man standing in front of you, whose lips were slightly apart as if something was sinking in.</p><p>Apparently you both haven&rsquo;t seen the time pass, but another song was playing now: 'Hallelujah&rsquo; by H&auml;ndel. The song&rsquo;s strong chords seemed to break the spell you two were under and all you could do was walk towards each other closing the distance between you. With your arms around Chris&rsquo;s neck, and his around your waist, you smiled and giggled at one another. No words were necessary 'cause your eyes and hearts were speaking a language only you could comprehend.</p><p>&ldquo;And the 'soon&rsquo; I was waiting for came in an unexpected way&rdquo;, Chris said softly touching your foreheads.</p><p>&ldquo;And in an unexpected way I finally found out where my heart belongs to&rdquo;.</p><p>Chris&rsquo;s smile widened and he gave you a gentle peck on the nose right before pressing his lips passionately against yours.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p><i>(Credits to Robert Kearns&rsquo;s channel on Youtube.

Four, long, torturous days. After your night in the\npark, he had to work the next two days on re-recording some audio for a movie\nhe had filmed a few months back. Luckily for him and yourself, he just had to\ngo to the studio, no flight out of state needed. Unfortunately, it was long\nhours for him, and your schedule wasn\u2019t helping either. You both were back to\ntexting and calling at random hours of the day. You had to scold yourself for\nbeing on your phone so much at work. It was hard to reprimand your intern if\nyou were texting more than he was. </p><!-- more --><p>Chris had begged you to spend the\nnight at his house the last two nights, but you were sticking to your guns. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only two more days Chris. We can\nmake it. I didn\u2019t see you for a full month and we survived that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. I haven\u2019t seen you in a\nmonth!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sighed. Even though you were the one not budging, it was hard on\nyour too.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI know. You\u2019re right. Can\u2019t you come over for a little while\nthough?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cWe both know I won\u2019t end up leaving. Dodger\nwill cuddle with me and I\u2019ll fall asleep. It\u2019s already after eleven.\u201d You let\nout a laugh and you heard him slightly chuckle as well.</p><p>That night in the park where you had\nconfessed your feelings for each other, he insisted on walking you home. Hand in\nhand. It was sweet and romantic with the sun setting in the distance. He walked\nyou up the stairs to your door. Turning to face him, you leaned in for a kiss\nand then pulled back to say goodnight. Chris grabbed the back your head to hold\nyou in place which caused you to start giggling. Once you started you couldn\u2019t\nstop. He laid his head on your shoulder and joined you.</p><p>\u201cThis is how it\u2019s going to be, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d He asked. Smile evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you know the answer\nto that by now. I hope this doesn\u2019t charge your mind.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and looked you in\nthe eyes. He gave you a chaste kiss. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Kiss \u201cNot.\u201d Kiss \u201cI.\u201d Kiss\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t.\u201d Kiss \u201cChange.\u201d Kiss \u201cA thing.\u201d Kiss</p><p>You circled your arms around his waist\nand caught your breath. He wrapped his arms around you and buried his head in\nyour hair. </p><p>\u201cCan we stay over tonight?\u201d You pulled\nback to look at his face to get a read on if he was serious or not. \u201cOr you can\npack a bag and we can go to mine.\u201d He said.</p><p>You let out a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nthat\u2019s a good idea. We talked about doing this right. I think sleeping over\nwithout even having a date first is jumping ahead.\u201d </p><p>He grabbed your hand in both of his\nand rubbed it gently. \u201cI do want to do this right, but we\u2019ve slept over at our\nplaces plenty of times.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but that was as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t friends anymore?\u201d Eyebrows\nraised with a serious expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cStop. You know that\u2019s not true. You\nare my friend.\u201d He pulled your hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cBut I think we\nneed to take a step back from the sleeping over thing. Just for a while.\u201d</p><p>He nodded solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be\na long four days.\u201d </p><p>You kissed each cheek and then kissed\nhis lips long and slow. You rested your forehead on his and then kissed his\nnose before unlocking your door and saying goodnight. </p><p>The next\nnight you were working late with Victoria in the office. You were coordinating a\nwedding that weekend and you were tasked with rearranging the seating chart as\nthe bride had officially given up and the groom didn\u2019t want to be involved.\nThere had been a falling out between the bride\u2019s mother and father. They had\nbeen divorced for a number of years but tensions had picked up due to the\nincreasing budget. Mr. Schmitt and the former Mrs. Schmitt no longer agreed to\nbe seated at the same table. Because the wedding was already so large, there was\nno room to add an additional table. You planned to come up with four optional\nchanges to resolve the seating crisis and send it to the bride tomorrow. You\nhad three, but couldn\u2019t come up with the fourth. Your goal was to be home by\nnine, but it was already ten. Chris had been texting you, but you hadn\u2019t been\nable to look or respond for the last hour. </p><p>A knocking at the door got your and Victoria\u2019s attention. It\u2019s an event coordinating\noffice, you usually didn\u2019t have visitors and it was well after delivery hours. You\nstood up and motioned for Victoria to join you as you both crept to the front\nof the office. The door is glass with no shade so you easily spotted Chris on\nthe other side of the door. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Chris doing here?\u201d Victoria asked. \n\n\n\n</p><p>Deciding to\nkeep this new relationship between the two of you for a while, Victoria did not\nknow about the kissing or the date tomorrow night. </p><p>You shrugged\nyour shoulders as you walked to the door. Victoria staying by the reception\ndesk. \u201cHe was texting me, but I haven\u2019t had time to read them.\u201d </p><p>You unlocked\nthe door and opened it for him to enter. You subtly nodded your head back in Victoria\u2019s\ndirection so that he wouldn\u2019t greet you with a kiss. He gave you a wink and\nraised his hand.</p><p>\u201cHi\nVictoria. Great to see you again.\u201d</p><p>She walked\ntoward the two of you and gave him a hug. <i>Everyone\u2019s a hugger in this town.</i></p><p>\u201cI hope you\ndon\u2019t mind me borrowing Y/N for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.\n\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ll just be in there.\u201d Victoria pointed to the conference room\nin the back corner that you two were occupying and hurriedly walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou doing here? Not that I\u2019m not happy to see you.\u201d You leaned in for a kiss\nbut he was hesitant. \u201cChris, babe, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d <i>Babe? I sure like that\nword apparently.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nfor just showing up here, but I really needed to talk to you.\u201d You nodded and\nmotioned to the overstuffed chairs near the door. You both took a seat as you\nfelt your heart rate increase. Was he already having doubts? Did he want to\ncancel your date and thought it best to do in person. It had only been three\ndays. What could happen in three days?</p><p>He grabbed\nyour hand. <i>At least this is comforting. \u201c</i>There\u2019s a story that came out\ntoday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What\nkind of story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\ntook some pictures at that bachelor party I went to. There was this girl\nthere.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh boy. </i>If your heart wasn\u2019t already pumping\nas fast as it was, you were pretty sure it was setting a record.</p><p>You nodded\nasking that he continue. \u201cNothing happened. I just want to emphasize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris, we\nweren\u2019t together then. I mean, we\u2019re barely together now.\u201d You were being\nhonest. Yeah, it hurt you a bit that he hooked up with some random woman at the\nparty, but he\u2019s not yours to claim. You hadn\u2019t even had the discussion about\nseeing each other until a couple days after that party. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to come back to that comment about\nnot being together now, but I want to explain myself first.\u201d He said, eyebrows\nfurrowed. \u201cThere were a few girls that sat in our section at the club. Some of\nthe other guys let them up. This particular woman wanted a picture so she sat\non my lap to take it. We took a couple of selfies together. She kissed my cheek\nin one. One of her friends or someone else took a picture of the two of us from\na distance and in that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npicture\nit looks like her and I are kissing. A story came out today with the pictures\nsaying her and I are an item. I don\u2019t even know her name.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s\nimportant to me that you believe me.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p>You shake\nyour head. Of course, you believed him. You didn\u2019t think he would lie about\nsomething like this. \u201cChris, I believe you.\u201d He looked surprised. He reached out\nand stroked your cheek. You couldn\u2019t help but lean in. \u201cEven if it were true,\nwe hadn\u2019t seen each other in a month, you\u2019re allowed to be with other women.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut I was\nbeing honest with you when I said I wasn\u2019t hooking up.\u201d He moved his other hand\nto your face and held it with both hands. \u201cSweetheart, I didn\u2019t want to be with\nanyone else. I hope this doesn\u2019t make me sound like an asshole, but when you\nand Tim broke up, I held out hope that one day you\u2019d forgive me and we could be\ntogether.\u201d </p><p>You closed\nyour eyes and shook your head. \u201cWell aren\u2019t you lucky that your wish came\ntrue.\u201d</p><p>He stood up,\ngiving you a hand to help you stand up. He pulled you close and hugged you\naround your waist. \u201cI just wanted to tell you in person in case you saw\nsomething online.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p>You leaned\nin capturing his lips in a quick kiss before pulling back. \u201cThank you for\ntelling me. I hate to kick you out, but I really need to wrap today up.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled\nand pulled you back in for another hug. You walked him to the door and locked\nup, promising to see him tomorrow for your date. Now to come up with a lie to\ntell Victoria why he was there.</p><p>On your\nlunch break the next day, you pulled up Google and typed in Chris Evans.\nWithout a doubt, you one hundred percent believed that he didn\u2019t hook up with\nthat woman, but you were curious. You\u2019ve always loved movies, but you were\nnever really the type to look up celebrities or buy celebrity magazines. Sure\nenough, under recent news were pictures of Chris and a young brunette. Big doe\neyes and bright red lips. She was wearing a tight black dress that showed off\nher ample cleavage. She was beautiful. The headlines said things like <i>New\nLove for Chris</i>, <i>New Couple Alert</i>, <i>Is She the One?</i> You hadn\u2019t\neven met her but you felt completely average by just looking at a picture of\nher on Chris\u2019 lap. They looked like the typical Hollywood couple. You closed\nyour laptop and dug into your left over pasta trying not to continue to compare\nyourself to other women. </p><p>\n\nAfter work, you went home to shower and change\nfor your date with Chris. A date. Who would have ever thought that would happen\nbetween the two of you? It was hard not being able to share your excitement\nwith anyone. You just really wanted to make sure things were really happening\nbetween the two of you before you brought your friends and family into the mix.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>What if you\ncrashed and burned? You barely kept your friendship, who\u2019s to say dating would\ngo any better? Ugh, you really needed to get rid of these negative thoughts. </p><p>You were\ndressed and ready to go with ten minutes to spare. Chris said to dress nicely,\nso you chose a cobalt blue wrap dress with three fourth length sleeves. You\ngrabbed a black wrap since it was still chilly at night and you didn\u2019t have a\ncoat that would look nice with your dress.</p><p>At first you\nwaited by the door for Chris. But that felt weird so you sat on your couch.\nFeet planted on the ground and hunched forward. Then you crossed your legs and\nleaned back trying to relax. Shoes! You should probably have your shoes on. You\nquickly walked to your closet and took out the new paid of black sling backs\nyou purchased the other day. You really should have broken them in first, but\nyou frankly had no time. Once the second shoe was in place, you heard a knock\nat your door. Grabbing your wrap and handbag, you opened the door to a very nicely\ndressed Chris. He had on a black suit with a white button-down sans tie and he\nlooked good enough to eat.</p><p>\u201cY/N. You\nlook\u2026wow. You look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>You lowered\nyour head bashfully and smiled. \u201cThank you. You also look beautiful.\u201d You\nlaughed. \u201cI mean, you look great.\u201d He smiled and reached for your hand. It was\nlike this was your first time meeting. Nerves were getting the best of you.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nready to go?\u201d He asked. You nodded and followed him out the door. </p><p>The\nrestaurant Chris chose was called n/naka. You weren\u2019t sure how to pronounce it,\nbut Chris had texted you the name so you could look it up to get an idea of the\nvibe. Apparently, it was one of those places that was extremely hard to get\ninto. Chris had the car valet parked and helped you out of the car. He gave the\nhost his name and she escorted you to the table with Chris\u2019 hand on the small\nof your back the whole way. </p><p>The\nrestaurant was beautiful with low lights and clean lines. The tables were a\nlittle close together for your liking, but you only had eyes for Chris anyway.</p><p>The server\nappeared at your table and informed you the menu was a prefix 13 course dinner.\nYour eyes widened and you instantly regretted the pasta lunch. Your server,\nJoseph, asked if you wanted to do the wine pairing. You looked to Chris who\nnodded at the server. </p><p>The wine\narrived first. You weren\u2019t a wine expert by any means, but it was red and\ndelish. </p><p>Chris held\nup his glass and you followed suit. \u201cTo a lovely evening with a lovely lady.\nAnd to many more.\u201d You clinked your glass to his and made sure to keep eye\ncontact as you took a sip. Chris somehow managed to cough as he took his sip\nand promptly spilled the offending wine down the front of his white dress\nshirt. Your hands immediately covered your mouth as you scanned the restaurant\nfor your server who apparently had seen the incident along with several other\npatrons. Chris started to laugh and you did as well. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did\nthat!\u201d</p><p>Joseph\nappeared with a glass of club soda and an extra napkin. Chris immediately began\nto work on the stain, but it wasn\u2019t coming out. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\nRed\u2019s a good color on you.\u201d You said with a wink. </p><p>His cheeks\nbecame rosy and he gave a bashful smile. </p><p>The first\nthree courses came out fast and were quickly eaten up. You were worried when\nJoseph said there would be thirteen, but each course wasn\u2019t much more than a\nbite. Thinly sliced veggies and meats decorated like a piece of art on a plate.\nYou tried desperately to keep an open mind and try each dish even when you\ndidn\u2019t know what it was. Several of the dishes were seafood which you generally\nliked, but you were more of a fish and chips or shrimp kind of girl. These\ndishes were seared tuna and pickled cod. You were trying every dish because Chris had gone\nto so much effort in planning the date. If this was his type of thing, you wanted\nto be able to enjoy it with him. </p><p>It was when\nthe tenth dish came out that things took a turn for the worse. The beautifully\nplated dish had some sort of meat on it, but you weren\u2019t sure what it was.\nChris seemed to eat his piece with no problem, so you figured you could do the\nsame. You pierced the small piece of meat and slid it through the sauce that\ndecorated the plate. Bringing the fork to your mouth you took a tentative bite.\nThe sauce had a good flavor, but the texture of the meat almost made you gag.\nWith it still in your mouth, you inhaled through your nose slowly and went to\nchew again. But you couldn\u2019t. The texture was too much and you gaged. Like\ngaged out loud that Chris and the table next to you heard. Your face instantly\nheated. Grabbing your napkin, you brought it to your mouth, trying to elegantly\nspit it into the napkin. Update, there is no real true way to elegantly do\nthat, besides Chris was watching with concern.</p><p>You grabbed\nyour glass of white and promptly drank it down. Once it was empty you looked to\nChris. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so embarrassed!\u201d He reached for your hand and shook\nhis head politely. \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d</p><p>Chris\nchuckled softly. \u201cI think it was eel.\u201d He shrugged as he said that.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s\nsafe to say I don\u2019t like eel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually\ndidn\u2019t care for it either.\u201d</p><p>You started\nto giggle which turned into full belly laughs when Chris joined in. The other\npatrons did not look amused, but it this point, neither of you cared. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we\ndoing here Chris? This so isn\u2019t us.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. I honestly have no idea what I was\nthinking.\u201d You squeezed his hand and he did the same.\n\n\n\n</p><p>With the\nremaining courses you stuck to the vegetables on the plate if you could not\nidentify the meat as one you liked. </p><p>Chris paid\nthe bill and the two of you walked out, wine stain and all. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cAre you\nstill hungry by chance?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You looked\nto him with bright eyes. \u201cOh my God yes!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>The two of\nyou went through the drive thru at In-N-Out Burger and ate your food in the parking\nlot. When you finished your burger, you were completely stuffed. </p><p>Chris drove\nyou home and walked you to your door. You were tempted to invite him in because\nyou didn\u2019t want the evening to end. However, you didn\u2019t want the implication\nthat you wanted things to go further tonight. After all, Chris is the one who\nsaid he wanted to woo you. </p><p>\u201cDespite me\ngagging during dinner, I had a really good time with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first\nglass of wine dripping down my shirt didn\u2019t ruin the evening?\u201d He asked, a\nsmall smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cNope. Not\nat all.\u201d You said. Taking a step closer to him, you put your hands on the\nlapels of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m\nglad to hear it. I hope I can see you again.\u201d Speaking softer now, all joking\nforgotten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really\nlike that. In fact, I\u2019d like to see you tomorrow if you can pencil me in.\u201d</p><p>He brushed\nhis lips against yours in a barely there kiss. \u201cI think that sounds like a\ngreat idea. How about you come over in comfy clothes? I\u2019ll order a pizza and\nwill watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>You brushed\nyour lips against his and pulled back. You nodded your head and bit you lower\nlip. \u201cOkay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d He\nasked.</p><p>\u201cMmhmm.\u201d\nKiss \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Kiss</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\ndate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019ll ever get tired of hearing that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll\nnever stop saying this.\u201d</p><p><i>Could he\nbe any more perfect?</i></p><p>\n\nChris pushed his fingers through your hair,\ngently embracing the back of your head and pulling you in for a kiss. It was\nmore needy than the ones before. You parted your lips to grant him entrance\nwhich he greedily took. His tongue exploring your mouth which caused you to\nmoan. He groaned in reply and you suddenly wished you had invited him in. His\nbeard rubbed against your skin deliciously, but you were sure your face would\nbe red when you said goodnight.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t\nuntil Chris pulled back to take a breath did you regain your composure. You\nleaned forward and kissed his nose.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\nYou said.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You unlocked\nyour door and hesitantly went inside, turning back to see Chris standing there\nwith his hands in his pockets, a soft grin on his face.</p><p>After\nchanging for bed and putting on HGTV to wind down, your phone dinged with a\nmessage from Chris.</p><p><b>Chris:</b>\nGoodnight sweetheart\u00a0</p><p><b>Y/N:</b> Goodnight babe\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://jamielea81.tumblr.com/post/185543618602/a-walk-in-the-park\">Chapter 19</a></p><p><b>Tag List:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moWlXU_tkFGl50_6o7QzSDQ\">@lookwhatyoumademequeue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvfaKCaSRME5COH2CQ6-ovA\">@crimeshowtrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JrTGsFTiMAO9fKLcL-lvQ\">@cocomel0613</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6DSHP6G1vpP7li5LmR6CQ\">@flamencodiva</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKdHrEp3ArmzlDlksyCfjEg\">@thefandomzoneisdangerous</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m32gA_h2XVKj-lmfoTHN9nw\">@maddie-laufeyson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnPlqAPa7IwakHwqFG5A5Q\">@shameless-pope</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m639hcuSi1UGZxR0GtJGL-A\">@pivans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrbVOq7dBun4OlAYbNJYUA\">@symonlyjen5</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQpaow9hD50-M6p3h_4v4A\">@inlovewith3</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5sxGUUI1xQXrPWP8Y2Frg\">@fanfiiiiiiics</a><b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNpq6fCujEef3jJxaomtzZA\">@violetadefebrero</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLMzGhcPlZ6nf01yyvdOnOQ\">@not-another-tmblr</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXZKEpKJPMCLdMnz0gqteXA\">@thenormreedus</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfHeOC5QKdkvC5il44pAkvA\">@ly-cia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJa6FroirmgJOdcmN1nJ7XQ\">@estillion14</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-20P6Yp67PXawboI2n8Ryw\">@chita0027</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBxf4DMfA5y6VQvTy4-MRXA\">@smoothdogsgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m12_H4vOR6Yg6oQ7DIkgl1w\">@the&ndash;blackdahlia</a></b></p>",

Four, long, torturous days. After your night in the\npark, he had to work the next two days on re-recording some audio for a movie\nhe had filmed a few months back. Luckily for him and yourself, he just had to\ngo to the studio, no flight out of state needed. Unfortunately, it was long\nhours for him, and your schedule wasn\u2019t helping either. You both were back to\ntexting and calling at random hours of the day. You had to scold yourself for\nbeing on your phone so much at work. It was hard to reprimand your intern if\nyou were texting more than he was. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Chris had begged you to spend the\nnight at his house the last two nights, but you were sticking to your guns. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only two more days Chris. We can\nmake it. I didn\u2019t see you for a full month and we survived that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. I haven\u2019t seen you in a\nmonth!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sighed. Even though you were the one not budging, it was hard on\nyour too.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI know. You\u2019re right. Can\u2019t you come over for a little while\nthough?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cWe both know I won\u2019t end up leaving. Dodger\nwill cuddle with me and I\u2019ll fall asleep. It\u2019s already after eleven.\u201d You let\nout a laugh and you heard him slightly chuckle as well.</p><p>That night in the park where you had\nconfessed your feelings for each other, he insisted on walking you home. Hand in\nhand. It was sweet and romantic with the sun setting in the distance. He walked\nyou up the stairs to your door. Turning to face him, you leaned in for a kiss\nand then pulled back to say goodnight. Chris grabbed the back your head to hold\nyou in place which caused you to start giggling. Once you started you couldn\u2019t\nstop. He laid his head on your shoulder and joined you.</p><p>\u201cThis is how it\u2019s going to be, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d He asked. Smile evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you know the answer\nto that by now. I hope this doesn\u2019t charge your mind.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and looked you in\nthe eyes. He gave you a chaste kiss. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Kiss \u201cNot.\u201d Kiss \u201cI.\u201d Kiss\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t.\u201d Kiss \u201cChange.\u201d Kiss \u201cA thing.\u201d Kiss</p><p>You circled your arms around his waist\nand caught your breath. He wrapped his arms around you and buried his head in\nyour hair. </p><p>\u201cCan we stay over tonight?\u201d You pulled\nback to look at his face to get a read on if he was serious or not. \u201cOr you can\npack a bag and we can go to mine.\u201d He said.</p><p>You let out a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nthat\u2019s a good idea. We talked about doing this right. I think sleeping over\nwithout even having a date first is jumping ahead.\u201d </p><p>He grabbed your hand in both of his\nand rubbed it gently. \u201cI do want to do this right, but we\u2019ve slept over at our\nplaces plenty of times.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but that was as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t friends anymore?\u201d Eyebrows\nraised with a serious expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cStop. You know that\u2019s not true. You\nare my friend.\u201d He pulled your hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cBut I think we\nneed to take a step back from the sleeping over thing. Just for a while.\u201d</p><p>He nodded solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be\na long four days.\u201d </p><p>You kissed each cheek and then kissed\nhis lips long and slow. You rested your forehead on his and then kissed his\nnose before unlocking your door and saying goodnight. </p><p>The next\nnight you were working late with Victoria in the office. You were coordinating a\nwedding that weekend and you were tasked with rearranging the seating chart as\nthe bride had officially given up and the groom didn\u2019t want to be involved.\nThere had been a falling out between the bride\u2019s mother and father. They had\nbeen divorced for a number of years but tensions had picked up due to the\nincreasing budget. Mr. Schmitt and the former Mrs. Schmitt no longer agreed to\nbe seated at the same table. Because the wedding was already so large, there was\nno room to add an additional table. You planned to come up with four optional\nchanges to resolve the seating crisis and send it to the bride tomorrow. You\nhad three, but couldn\u2019t come up with the fourth. Your goal was to be home by\nnine, but it was already ten. Chris had been texting you, but you hadn\u2019t been\nable to look or respond for the last hour. </p><p>A knocking at the door got your and Victoria\u2019s attention. It\u2019s an event coordinating\noffice, you usually didn\u2019t have visitors and it was well after delivery hours. You\nstood up and motioned for Victoria to join you as you both crept to the front\nof the office. The door is glass with no shade so you easily spotted Chris on\nthe other side of the door. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Chris doing here?\u201d Victoria asked. \n\n\n\n</p><p>Deciding to\nkeep this new relationship between the two of you for a while, Victoria did not\nknow about the kissing or the date tomorrow night. </p><p>You shrugged\nyour shoulders as you walked to the door. Victoria staying by the reception\ndesk. \u201cHe was texting me, but I haven\u2019t had time to read them.\u201d </p><p>You unlocked\nthe door and opened it for him to enter. You subtly nodded your head back in Victoria\u2019s\ndirection so that he wouldn\u2019t greet you with a kiss. He gave you a wink and\nraised his hand.</p><p>\u201cHi\nVictoria. Great to see you again.\u201d</p><p>She walked\ntoward the two of you and gave him a hug. <i>Everyone\u2019s a hugger in this town.</i></p><p>\u201cI hope you\ndon\u2019t mind me borrowing Y/N for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.\n\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ll just be in there.\u201d Victoria pointed to the conference room\nin the back corner that you two were occupying and hurriedly walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou doing here? Not that I\u2019m not happy to see you.\u201d You leaned in for a kiss\nbut he was hesitant. \u201cChris, babe, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d <i>Babe? I sure like that\nword apparently.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nfor just showing up here, but I really needed to talk to you.\u201d You nodded and\nmotioned to the overstuffed chairs near the door. You both took a seat as you\nfelt your heart rate increase. Was he already having doubts? Did he want to\ncancel your date and thought it best to do in person. It had only been three\ndays. What could happen in three days?</p><p>He grabbed\nyour hand. <i>At least this is comforting. \u201c</i>There\u2019s a story that came out\ntoday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What\nkind of story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\ntook some pictures at that bachelor party I went to. There was this girl\nthere.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh boy. </i>If your heart wasn\u2019t already pumping\nas fast as it was, you were pretty sure it was setting a record.</p><p>You nodded\nasking that he continue. \u201cNothing happened. I just want to emphasize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris, we\nweren\u2019t together then. I mean, we\u2019re barely together now.\u201d You were being\nhonest. Yeah, it hurt you a bit that he hooked up with some random woman at the\nparty, but he\u2019s not yours to claim. You hadn\u2019t even had the discussion about\nseeing each other until a couple days after that party. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to come back to that comment about\nnot being together now, but I want to explain myself first.\u201d He said, eyebrows\nfurrowed. \u201cThere were a few girls that sat in our section at the club. Some of\nthe other guys let them up. This particular woman wanted a picture so she sat\non my lap to take it. We took a couple of selfies together. She kissed my cheek\nin one. One of her friends or someone else took a picture of the two of us from\na distance and in that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npicture\nit looks like her and I are kissing. A story came out today with the pictures\nsaying her and I are an item. I don\u2019t even know her name.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s\nimportant to me that you believe me.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p>You shake\nyour head. Of course, you believed him. You didn\u2019t think he would lie about\nsomething like this. \u201cChris, I believe you.\u201d He looked surprised. He reached out\nand stroked your cheek. You couldn\u2019t help but lean in. \u201cEven if it were true,\nwe hadn\u2019t seen each other in a month, you\u2019re allowed to be with other women.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut I was\nbeing honest with you when I said I wasn\u2019t hooking up.\u201d He moved his other hand\nto your face and held it with both hands. \u201cSweetheart, I didn\u2019t want to be with\nanyone else. I hope this doesn\u2019t make me sound like an asshole, but when you\nand Tim broke up, I held out hope that one day you\u2019d forgive me and we could be\ntogether.\u201d </p><p>You closed\nyour eyes and shook your head. \u201cWell aren\u2019t you lucky that your wish came\ntrue.\u201d</p><p>He stood up,\ngiving you a hand to help you stand up. He pulled you close and hugged you\naround your waist. \u201cI just wanted to tell you in person in case you saw\nsomething online.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p>You leaned\nin capturing his lips in a quick kiss before pulling back. \u201cThank you for\ntelling me. I hate to kick you out, but I really need to wrap today up.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled\nand pulled you back in for another hug. You walked him to the door and locked\nup, promising to see him tomorrow for your date. Now to come up with a lie to\ntell Victoria why he was there.</p><p>On your\nlunch break the next day, you pulled up Google and typed in Chris Evans.\nWithout a doubt, you one hundred percent believed that he didn\u2019t hook up with\nthat woman, but you were curious. You\u2019ve always loved movies, but you were\nnever really the type to look up celebrities or buy celebrity magazines. Sure\nenough, under recent news were pictures of Chris and a young brunette. Big doe\neyes and bright red lips. She was wearing a tight black dress that showed off\nher ample cleavage. She was beautiful. The headlines said things like <i>New\nLove for Chris</i>, <i>New Couple Alert</i>, <i>Is She the One?</i> You hadn\u2019t\neven met her but you felt completely average by just looking at a picture of\nher on Chris\u2019 lap. They looked like the typical Hollywood couple. You closed\nyour laptop and dug into your left over pasta trying not to continue to compare\nyourself to other women. </p><p>\n\nAfter work, you went home to shower and change\nfor your date with Chris. A date. Who would have ever thought that would happen\nbetween the two of you? It was hard not being able to share your excitement\nwith anyone. You just really wanted to make sure things were really happening\nbetween the two of you before you brought your friends and family into the mix.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>What if you\ncrashed and burned? You barely kept your friendship, who\u2019s to say dating would\ngo any better? Ugh, you really needed to get rid of these negative thoughts. </p><p>You were\ndressed and ready to go with ten minutes to spare. Chris said to dress nicely,\nso you chose a cobalt blue wrap dress with three fourth length sleeves. You\ngrabbed a black wrap since it was still chilly at night and you didn\u2019t have a\ncoat that would look nice with your dress.</p><p>At first you\nwaited by the door for Chris. But that felt weird so you sat on your couch.\nFeet planted on the ground and hunched forward. Then you crossed your legs and\nleaned back trying to relax. Shoes! You should probably have your shoes on. You\nquickly walked to your closet and took out the new paid of black sling backs\nyou purchased the other day. You really should have broken them in first, but\nyou frankly had no time. Once the second shoe was in place, you heard a knock\nat your door. Grabbing your wrap and handbag, you opened the door to a very nicely\ndressed Chris. He had on a black suit with a white button-down sans tie and he\nlooked good enough to eat.</p><p>\u201cY/N. You\nlook\u2026wow. You look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>You lowered\nyour head bashfully and smiled. \u201cThank you. You also look beautiful.\u201d You\nlaughed. \u201cI mean, you look great.\u201d He smiled and reached for your hand. It was\nlike this was your first time meeting. Nerves were getting the best of you.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nready to go?\u201d He asked. You nodded and followed him out the door. </p><p>The\nrestaurant Chris chose was called n/naka. You weren\u2019t sure how to pronounce it,\nbut Chris had texted you the name so you could look it up to get an idea of the\nvibe. Apparently, it was one of those places that was extremely hard to get\ninto. Chris had the car valet parked and helped you out of the car. He gave the\nhost his name and she escorted you to the table with Chris\u2019 hand on the small\nof your back the whole way. </p><p>The\nrestaurant was beautiful with low lights and clean lines. The tables were a\nlittle close together for your liking, but you only had eyes for Chris anyway.</p><p>The server\nappeared at your table and informed you the menu was a prefix 13 course dinner.\nYour eyes widened and you instantly regretted the pasta lunch. Your server,\nJoseph, asked if you wanted to do the wine pairing. You looked to Chris who\nnodded at the server. </p><p>The wine\narrived first. You weren\u2019t a wine expert by any means, but it was red and\ndelish. </p><p>Chris held\nup his glass and you followed suit. \u201cTo a lovely evening with a lovely lady.\nAnd to many more.\u201d You clinked your glass to his and made sure to keep eye\ncontact as you took a sip. Chris somehow managed to cough as he took his sip\nand promptly spilled the offending wine down the front of his white dress\nshirt. Your hands immediately covered your mouth as you scanned the restaurant\nfor your server who apparently had seen the incident along with several other\npatrons. Chris started to laugh and you did as well. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did\nthat!\u201d</p><p>Joseph\nappeared with a glass of club soda and an extra napkin. Chris immediately began\nto work on the stain, but it wasn\u2019t coming out. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\nRed\u2019s a good color on you.\u201d You said with a wink. </p><p>His cheeks\nbecame rosy and he gave a bashful smile. </p><p>The first\nthree courses came out fast and were quickly eaten up. You were worried when\nJoseph said there would be thirteen, but each course wasn\u2019t much more than a\nbite. Thinly sliced veggies and meats decorated like a piece of art on a plate.\nYou tried desperately to keep an open mind and try each dish even when you\ndidn\u2019t know what it was. Several of the dishes were seafood which you generally\nliked, but you were more of a fish and chips or shrimp kind of girl. These\ndishes were seared tuna and pickled cod. You were trying every dish because Chris had gone\nto so much effort in planning the date. If this was his type of thing, you wanted\nto be able to enjoy it with him. </p><p>It was when\nthe tenth dish came out that things took a turn for the worse. The beautifully\nplated dish had some sort of meat on it, but you weren\u2019t sure what it was.\nChris seemed to eat his piece with no problem, so you figured you could do the\nsame. You pierced the small piece of meat and slid it through the sauce that\ndecorated the plate. Bringing the fork to your mouth you took a tentative bite.\nThe sauce had a good flavor, but the texture of the meat almost made you gag.\nWith it still in your mouth, you inhaled through your nose slowly and went to\nchew again. But you couldn\u2019t. The texture was too much and you gaged. Like\ngaged out loud that Chris and the table next to you heard. Your face instantly\nheated. Grabbing your napkin, you brought it to your mouth, trying to elegantly\nspit it into the napkin. Update, there is no real true way to elegantly do\nthat, besides Chris was watching with concern.</p><p>You grabbed\nyour glass of white and promptly drank it down. Once it was empty you looked to\nChris. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so embarrassed!\u201d He reached for your hand and shook\nhis head politely. \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d</p><p>Chris\nchuckled softly. \u201cI think it was eel.\u201d He shrugged as he said that.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s\nsafe to say I don\u2019t like eel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually\ndidn\u2019t care for it either.\u201d</p><p>You started\nto giggle which turned into full belly laughs when Chris joined in. The other\npatrons did not look amused, but it this point, neither of you cared. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we\ndoing here Chris? This so isn\u2019t us.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. I honestly have no idea what I was\nthinking.\u201d You squeezed his hand and he did the same.\n\n\n\n</p><p>With the\nremaining courses you stuck to the vegetables on the plate if you could not\nidentify the meat as one you liked. </p><p>Chris paid\nthe bill and the two of you walked out, wine stain and all. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cAre you\nstill hungry by chance?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You looked\nto him with bright eyes. \u201cOh my God yes!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>The two of\nyou went through the drive thru at In-N-Out Burger and ate your food in the parking\nlot. When you finished your burger, you were completely stuffed. </p><p>Chris drove\nyou home and walked you to your door. You were tempted to invite him in because\nyou didn\u2019t want the evening to end. However, you didn\u2019t want the implication\nthat you wanted things to go further tonight. After all, Chris is the one who\nsaid he wanted to woo you. </p><p>\u201cDespite me\ngagging during dinner, I had a really good time with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first\nglass of wine dripping down my shirt didn\u2019t ruin the evening?\u201d He asked, a\nsmall smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cNope. Not\nat all.\u201d You said. Taking a step closer to him, you put your hands on the\nlapels of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m\nglad to hear it. I hope I can see you again.\u201d Speaking softer now, all joking\nforgotten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really\nlike that. In fact, I\u2019d like to see you tomorrow if you can pencil me in.\u201d</p><p>He brushed\nhis lips against yours in a barely there kiss. \u201cI think that sounds like a\ngreat idea. How about you come over in comfy clothes? I\u2019ll order a pizza and\nwill watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>You brushed\nyour lips against his and pulled back. You nodded your head and bit you lower\nlip. \u201cOkay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d He\nasked.</p><p>\u201cMmhmm.\u201d\nKiss \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Kiss</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\ndate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019ll ever get tired of hearing that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll\nnever stop saying this.\u201d</p><p><i>Could he\nbe any more perfect?</i></p><p>\n\nChris pushed his fingers through your hair,\ngently embracing the back of your head and pulling you in for a kiss. It was\nmore needy than the ones before. You parted your lips to grant him entrance\nwhich he greedily took. His tongue exploring your mouth which caused you to\nmoan. He groaned in reply and you suddenly wished you had invited him in. His\nbeard rubbed against your skin deliciously, but you were sure your face would\nbe red when you said goodnight.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t\nuntil Chris pulled back to take a breath did you regain your composure. You\nleaned forward and kissed his nose.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\nYou said.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You unlocked\nyour door and hesitantly went inside, turning back to see Chris standing there\nwith his hands in his pockets, a soft grin on his face.</p><p>After\nchanging for bed and putting on HGTV to wind down, your phone dinged with a\nmessage from Chris.</p><p><b>Chris:</b>\nGoodnight sweetheart\u00a0</p><p><b>Y/N:</b> Goodnight babe\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://jamielea81.tumblr.com/post/185543618602/a-walk-in-the-park\">Chapter 19</a></p><p><b>Tag List:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moWlXU_tkFGl50_6o7QzSDQ\">@lookwhatyoumademequeue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvfaKCaSRME5COH2CQ6-ovA\">@crimeshowtrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JrTGsFTiMAO9fKLcL-lvQ\">@cocomel0613</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6DSHP6G1vpP7li5LmR6CQ\">@flamencodiva</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKdHrEp3ArmzlDlksyCfjEg\">@thefandomzoneisdangerous</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m32gA_h2XVKj-lmfoTHN9nw\">@maddie-laufeyson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnPlqAPa7IwakHwqFG5A5Q\">@shameless-pope</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m639hcuSi1UGZxR0GtJGL-A\">@pivans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrbVOq7dBun4OlAYbNJYUA\">@symonlyjen5</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQpaow9hD50-M6p3h_4v4A\">@inlovewith3</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5sxGUUI1xQXrPWP8Y2Frg\">@fanfiiiiiiics</a><b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNpq6fCujEef3jJxaomtzZA\">@violetadefebrero</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLMzGhcPlZ6nf01yyvdOnOQ\">@not-another-tmblr</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXZKEpKJPMCLdMnz0gqteXA\">@thenormreedus</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfHeOC5QKdkvC5il44pAkvA\">@ly-cia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJa6FroirmgJOdcmN1nJ7XQ\">@estillion14</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-20P6Yp67PXawboI2n8Ryw\">@chita0027</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBxf4DMfA5y6VQvTy4-MRXA\">@smoothdogsgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m12_H4vOR6Yg6oQ7DIkgl1w\">@the\u2013blackdahlia</a></b></p>",

Four, long, torturous days. After your night in the\npark, he had to work the next two days on re-recording some audio for a movie\nhe had filmed a few months back. Luckily for him and yourself, he just had to\ngo to the studio, no flight out of state needed. Unfortunately, it was long\nhours for him, and your schedule wasn\u2019t helping either. You both were back to\ntexting and calling at random hours of the day. You had to scold yourself for\nbeing on your phone so much at work. It was hard to reprimand your intern if\nyou were texting more than he was. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Chris had begged you to spend the\nnight at his house the last two nights, but you were sticking to your guns. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only two more days Chris. We can\nmake it. I didn\u2019t see you for a full month and we survived that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. I haven\u2019t seen you in a\nmonth!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sighed. Even though you were the one not budging, it was hard on\nyour too.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI know. You\u2019re right. Can\u2019t you come over for a little while\nthough?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cWe both know I won\u2019t end up leaving. Dodger\nwill cuddle with me and I\u2019ll fall asleep. It\u2019s already after eleven.\u201d You let\nout a laugh and you heard him slightly chuckle as well.</p><p>That night in the park where you had\nconfessed your feelings for each other, he insisted on walking you home. Hand in\nhand. It was sweet and romantic with the sun setting in the distance. He walked\nyou up the stairs to your door. Turning to face him, you leaned in for a kiss\nand then pulled back to say goodnight. Chris grabbed the back your head to hold\nyou in place which caused you to start giggling. Once you started you couldn\u2019t\nstop. He laid his head on your shoulder and joined you.</p><p>\u201cThis is how it\u2019s going to be, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d He asked. Smile evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you know the answer\nto that by now. I hope this doesn\u2019t charge your mind.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and looked you in\nthe eyes. He gave you a chaste kiss. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Kiss \u201cNot.\u201d Kiss \u201cI.\u201d Kiss\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t.\u201d Kiss \u201cChange.\u201d Kiss \u201cA thing.\u201d Kiss</p><p>You circled your arms around his waist\nand caught your breath. He wrapped his arms around you and buried his head in\nyour hair. </p><p>\u201cCan we stay over tonight?\u201d You pulled\nback to look at his face to get a read on if he was serious or not. \u201cOr you can\npack a bag and we can go to mine.\u201d He said.</p><p>You let out a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nthat\u2019s a good idea. We talked about doing this right. I think sleeping over\nwithout even having a date first is jumping ahead.\u201d </p><p>He grabbed your hand in both of his\nand rubbed it gently. \u201cI do want to do this right, but we\u2019ve slept over at our\nplaces plenty of times.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but that was as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t friends anymore?\u201d Eyebrows\nraised with a serious expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cStop. You know that\u2019s not true. You\nare my friend.\u201d He pulled your hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cBut I think we\nneed to take a step back from the sleeping over thing. Just for a while.\u201d</p><p>He nodded solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be\na long four days.\u201d </p><p>You kissed each cheek and then kissed\nhis lips long and slow. You rested your forehead on his and then kissed his\nnose before unlocking your door and saying goodnight. </p><p>The next\nnight you were working late with Victoria in the office. You were coordinating a\nwedding that weekend and you were tasked with rearranging the seating chart as\nthe bride had officially given up and the groom didn\u2019t want to be involved.\nThere had been a falling out between the bride\u2019s mother and father. They had\nbeen divorced for a number of years but tensions had picked up due to the\nincreasing budget. Mr. Schmitt and the former Mrs. Schmitt no longer agreed to\nbe seated at the same table. Because the wedding was already so large, there was\nno room to add an additional table. You planned to come up with four optional\nchanges to resolve the seating crisis and send it to the bride tomorrow. You\nhad three, but couldn\u2019t come up with the fourth. Your goal was to be home by\nnine, but it was already ten. Chris had been texting you, but you hadn\u2019t been\nable to look or respond for the last hour. </p><p>A knocking at the door got your and Victoria\u2019s attention. It\u2019s an event coordinating\noffice, you usually didn\u2019t have visitors and it was well after delivery hours. You\nstood up and motioned for Victoria to join you as you both crept to the front\nof the office. The door is glass with no shade so you easily spotted Chris on\nthe other side of the door. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Chris doing here?\u201d Victoria asked. \n\n\n\n</p><p>Deciding to\nkeep this new relationship between the two of you for a while, Victoria did not\nknow about the kissing or the date tomorrow night. </p><p>You shrugged\nyour shoulders as you walked to the door. Victoria staying by the reception\ndesk. \u201cHe was texting me, but I haven\u2019t had time to read them.\u201d </p><p>You unlocked\nthe door and opened it for him to enter. You subtly nodded your head back in Victoria\u2019s\ndirection so that he wouldn\u2019t greet you with a kiss. He gave you a wink and\nraised his hand.</p><p>\u201cHi\nVictoria. Great to see you again.\u201d</p><p>She walked\ntoward the two of you and gave him a hug. <i>Everyone\u2019s a hugger in this town.</i></p><p>\u201cI hope you\ndon\u2019t mind me borrowing Y/N for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.\n\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ll just be in there.\u201d Victoria pointed to the conference room\nin the back corner that you two were occupying and hurriedly walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou doing here? Not that I\u2019m not happy to see you.\u201d You leaned in for a kiss\nbut he was hesitant. \u201cChris, babe, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d <i>Babe? I sure like that\nword apparently.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nfor just showing up here, but I really needed to talk to you.\u201d You nodded and\nmotioned to the overstuffed chairs near the door. You both took a seat as you\nfelt your heart rate increase. Was he already having doubts? Did he want to\ncancel your date and thought it best to do in person. It had only been three\ndays. What could happen in three days?</p><p>He grabbed\nyour hand. <i>At least this is comforting. \u201c</i>There\u2019s a story that came out\ntoday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What\nkind of story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\ntook some pictures at that bachelor party I went to. There was this girl\nthere.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh boy. </i>If your heart wasn\u2019t already pumping\nas fast as it was, you were pretty sure it was setting a record.</p><p>You nodded\nasking that he continue. \u201cNothing happened. I just want to emphasize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris, we\nweren\u2019t together then. I mean, we\u2019re barely together now.\u201d You were being\nhonest. Yeah, it hurt you a bit that he hooked up with some random woman at the\nparty, but he\u2019s not yours to claim. You hadn\u2019t even had the discussion about\nseeing each other until a couple days after that party. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to come back to that comment about\nnot being together now, but I want to explain myself first.\u201d He said, eyebrows\nfurrowed. \u201cThere were a few girls that sat in our section at the club. Some of\nthe other guys let them up. This particular woman wanted a picture so she sat\non my lap to take it. We took a couple of selfies together. She kissed my cheek\nin one. One of her friends or someone else took a picture of the two of us from\na distance and in that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npicture\nit looks like her and I are kissing. A story came out today with the pictures\nsaying her and I are an item. I don\u2019t even know her name.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s\nimportant to me that you believe me.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p>You shake\nyour head. Of course, you believed him. You didn\u2019t think he would lie about\nsomething like this. \u201cChris, I believe you.\u201d He looked surprised. He reached out\nand stroked your cheek. You couldn\u2019t help but lean in. \u201cEven if it were true,\nwe hadn\u2019t seen each other in a month, you\u2019re allowed to be with other women.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut I was\nbeing honest with you when I said I wasn\u2019t hooking up.\u201d He moved his other hand\nto your face and held it with both hands. \u201cSweetheart, I didn\u2019t want to be with\nanyone else. I hope this doesn\u2019t make me sound like an asshole, but when you\nand Tim broke up, I held out hope that one day you\u2019d forgive me and we could be\ntogether.\u201d </p><p>You closed\nyour eyes and shook your head. \u201cWell aren\u2019t you lucky that your wish came\ntrue.\u201d</p><p>He stood up,\ngiving you a hand to help you stand up. He pulled you close and hugged you\naround your waist. \u201cI just wanted to tell you in person in case you saw\nsomething online.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p>You leaned\nin capturing his lips in a quick kiss before pulling back. \u201cThank you for\ntelling me. I hate to kick you out, but I really need to wrap today up.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled\nand pulled you back in for another hug. You walked him to the door and locked\nup, promising to see him tomorrow for your date. Now to come up with a lie to\ntell Victoria why he was there.</p><p>On your\nlunch break the next day, you pulled up Google and typed in Chris Evans.\nWithout a doubt, you one hundred percent believed that he didn\u2019t hook up with\nthat woman, but you were curious. You\u2019ve always loved movies, but you were\nnever really the type to look up celebrities or buy celebrity magazines. Sure\nenough, under recent news were pictures of Chris and a young brunette. Big doe\neyes and bright red lips. She was wearing a tight black dress that showed off\nher ample cleavage. She was beautiful. The headlines said things like <i>New\nLove for Chris</i>, <i>New Couple Alert</i>, <i>Is She the One?</i> You hadn\u2019t\neven met her but you felt completely average by just looking at a picture of\nher on Chris\u2019 lap. They looked like the typical Hollywood couple. You closed\nyour laptop and dug into your left over pasta trying not to continue to compare\nyourself to other women. </p><p>\n\nAfter work, you went home to shower and change\nfor your date with Chris. A date. Who would have ever thought that would happen\nbetween the two of you? It was hard not being able to share your excitement\nwith anyone. You just really wanted to make sure things were really happening\nbetween the two of you before you brought your friends and family into the mix.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>What if you\ncrashed and burned? You barely kept your friendship, who\u2019s to say dating would\ngo any better? Ugh, you really needed to get rid of these negative thoughts. </p><p>You were\ndressed and ready to go with ten minutes to spare. Chris said to dress nicely,\nso you chose a cobalt blue wrap dress with three fourth length sleeves. You\ngrabbed a black wrap since it was still chilly at night and you didn\u2019t have a\ncoat that would look nice with your dress.</p><p>At first you\nwaited by the door for Chris. But that felt weird so you sat on your couch.\nFeet planted on the ground and hunched forward. Then you crossed your legs and\nleaned back trying to relax. Shoes! You should probably have your shoes on. You\nquickly walked to your closet and took out the new paid of black sling backs\nyou purchased the other day. You really should have broken them in first, but\nyou frankly had no time. Once the second shoe was in place, you heard a knock\nat your door. Grabbing your wrap and handbag, you opened the door to a very nicely\ndressed Chris. He had on a black suit with a white button-down sans tie and he\nlooked good enough to eat.</p><p>\u201cY/N. You\nlook\u2026wow. You look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>You lowered\nyour head bashfully and smiled. \u201cThank you. You also look beautiful.\u201d You\nlaughed. \u201cI mean, you look great.\u201d He smiled and reached for your hand. It was\nlike this was your first time meeting. Nerves were getting the best of you.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nready to go?\u201d He asked. You nodded and followed him out the door. </p><p>The\nrestaurant Chris chose was called n/naka. You weren\u2019t sure how to pronounce it,\nbut Chris had texted you the name so you could look it up to get an idea of the\nvibe. Apparently, it was one of those places that was extremely hard to get\ninto. Chris had the car valet parked and helped you out of the car. He gave the\nhost his name and she escorted you to the table with Chris\u2019 hand on the small\nof your back the whole way. </p><p>The\nrestaurant was beautiful with low lights and clean lines. The tables were a\nlittle close together for your liking, but you only had eyes for Chris anyway.</p><p>The server\nappeared at your table and informed you the menu was a prefix 13 course dinner.\nYour eyes widened and you instantly regretted the pasta lunch. Your server,\nJoseph, asked if you wanted to do the wine pairing. You looked to Chris who\nnodded at the server. </p><p>The wine\narrived first. You weren\u2019t a wine expert by any means, but it was red and\ndelish. </p><p>Chris held\nup his glass and you followed suit. \u201cTo a lovely evening with a lovely lady.\nAnd to many more.\u201d You clinked your glass to his and made sure to keep eye\ncontact as you took a sip. Chris somehow managed to cough as he took his sip\nand promptly spilled the offending wine down the front of his white dress\nshirt. Your hands immediately covered your mouth as you scanned the restaurant\nfor your server who apparently had seen the incident along with several other\npatrons. Chris started to laugh and you did as well. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did\nthat!\u201d</p><p>Joseph\nappeared with a glass of club soda and an extra napkin. Chris immediately began\nto work on the stain, but it wasn\u2019t coming out. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\nRed\u2019s a good color on you.\u201d You said with a wink. </p><p>His cheeks\nbecame rosy and he gave a bashful smile. </p><p>The first\nthree courses came out fast and were quickly eaten up. You were worried when\nJoseph said there would be thirteen, but each course wasn\u2019t much more than a\nbite. Thinly sliced veggies and meats decorated like a piece of art on a plate.\nYou tried desperately to keep an open mind and try each dish even when you\ndidn\u2019t know what it was. Several of the dishes were seafood which you generally\nliked, but you were more of a fish and chips or shrimp kind of girl. These\ndishes were seared tuna and pickled cod. You were trying every dish because Chris had gone\nto so much effort in planning the date. If this was his type of thing, you wanted\nto be able to enjoy it with him. </p><p>It was when\nthe tenth dish came out that things took a turn for the worse. The beautifully\nplated dish had some sort of meat on it, but you weren\u2019t sure what it was.\nChris seemed to eat his piece with no problem, so you figured you could do the\nsame. You pierced the small piece of meat and slid it through the sauce that\ndecorated the plate. Bringing the fork to your mouth you took a tentative bite.\nThe sauce had a good flavor, but the texture of the meat almost made you gag.\nWith it still in your mouth, you inhaled through your nose slowly and went to\nchew again. But you couldn\u2019t. The texture was too much and you gaged. Like\ngaged out loud that Chris and the table next to you heard. Your face instantly\nheated. Grabbing your napkin, you brought it to your mouth, trying to elegantly\nspit it into the napkin. Update, there is no real true way to elegantly do\nthat, besides Chris was watching with concern.</p><p>You grabbed\nyour glass of white and promptly drank it down. Once it was empty you looked to\nChris. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so embarrassed!\u201d He reached for your hand and shook\nhis head politely. \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d</p><p>Chris\nchuckled softly. \u201cI think it was eel.\u201d He shrugged as he said that.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s\nsafe to say I don\u2019t like eel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually\ndidn\u2019t care for it either.\u201d</p><p>You started\nto giggle which turned into full belly laughs when Chris joined in. The other\npatrons did not look amused, but it this point, neither of you cared. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we\ndoing here Chris? This so isn\u2019t us.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. I honestly have no idea what I was\nthinking.\u201d You squeezed his hand and he did the same.\n\n\n\n</p><p>With the\nremaining courses you stuck to the vegetables on the plate if you could not\nidentify the meat as one you liked. </p><p>Chris paid\nthe bill and the two of you walked out, wine stain and all. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cAre you\nstill hungry by chance?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You looked\nto him with bright eyes. \u201cOh my God yes!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>The two of\nyou went through the drive thru at In-N-Out Burger and ate your food in the parking\nlot. When you finished your burger, you were completely stuffed. </p><p>Chris drove\nyou home and walked you to your door. You were tempted to invite him in because\nyou didn\u2019t want the evening to end. However, you didn\u2019t want the implication\nthat you wanted things to go further tonight. After all, Chris is the one who\nsaid he wanted to woo you. </p><p>\u201cDespite me\ngagging during dinner, I had a really good time with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first\nglass of wine dripping down my shirt didn\u2019t ruin the evening?\u201d He asked, a\nsmall smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cNope. Not\nat all.\u201d You said. Taking a step closer to him, you put your hands on the\nlapels of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m\nglad to hear it. I hope I can see you again.\u201d Speaking softer now, all joking\nforgotten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really\nlike that. In fact, I\u2019d like to see you tomorrow if you can pencil me in.\u201d</p><p>He brushed\nhis lips against yours in a barely there kiss. \u201cI think that sounds like a\ngreat idea. How about you come over in comfy clothes? I\u2019ll order a pizza and\nwill watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>You brushed\nyour lips against his and pulled back. You nodded your head and bit you lower\nlip. \u201cOkay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d He\nasked.</p><p>\u201cMmhmm.\u201d\nKiss \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Kiss</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\ndate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019ll ever get tired of hearing that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll\nnever stop saying this.\u201d</p><p><i>Could he\nbe any more perfect?</i></p><p>\n\nChris pushed his fingers through your hair,\ngently embracing the back of your head and pulling you in for a kiss. It was\nmore needy than the ones before. You parted your lips to grant him entrance\nwhich he greedily took. His tongue exploring your mouth which caused you to\nmoan. He groaned in reply and you suddenly wished you had invited him in. His\nbeard rubbed against your skin deliciously, but you were sure your face would\nbe red when you said goodnight.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t\nuntil Chris pulled back to take a breath did you regain your composure. You\nleaned forward and kissed his nose.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\nYou said.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You unlocked\nyour door and hesitantly went inside, turning back to see Chris standing there\nwith his hands in his pockets, a soft grin on his face.</p><p>After\nchanging for bed and putting on HGTV to wind down, your phone dinged with a\nmessage from Chris.</p><p><b>Chris:</b>\nGoodnight sweetheart\u00a0</p><p><b>Y/N:</b> Goodnight babe\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://jamielea81.tumblr.com/post/185543618602/a-walk-in-the-park\">Chapter 19</a></p><p><b>Tag List:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moWlXU_tkFGl50_6o7QzSDQ\">@lookwhatyoumademequeue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvfaKCaSRME5COH2CQ6-ovA\">@crimeshowtrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JrTGsFTiMAO9fKLcL-lvQ\">@cocomel0613</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6DSHP6G1vpP7li5LmR6CQ\">@flamencodiva</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKdHrEp3ArmzlDlksyCfjEg\">@thefandomzoneisdangerous</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m32gA_h2XVKj-lmfoTHN9nw\">@maddie-laufeyson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnPlqAPa7IwakHwqFG5A5Q\">@shameless-pope</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m639hcuSi1UGZxR0GtJGL-A\">@pivans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrbVOq7dBun4OlAYbNJYUA\">@symonlyjen5</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQpaow9hD50-M6p3h_4v4A\">@inlovewith3</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5sxGUUI1xQXrPWP8Y2Frg\">@fanfiiiiiiics</a><b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNpq6fCujEef3jJxaomtzZA\">@violetadefebrero</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLMzGhcPlZ6nf01yyvdOnOQ\">@not-another-tmblr</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXZKEpKJPMCLdMnz0gqteXA\">@thenormreedus</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfHeOC5QKdkvC5il44pAkvA\">@ly-cia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJa6FroirmgJOdcmN1nJ7XQ\">@estillion14</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-20P6Yp67PXawboI2n8Ryw\">@chita0027</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBxf4DMfA5y6VQvTy4-MRXA\">@smoothdogsgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m12_H4vOR6Yg6oQ7DIkgl1w\">@the\u2013blackdahlia</a></b></p>",

Four, long, torturous days. After your night in the\npark, he had to work the next two days on re-recording some audio for a movie\nhe had filmed a few months back. Luckily for him and yourself, he just had to\ngo to the studio, no flight out of state needed. Unfortunately, it was long\nhours for him, and your schedule wasn&rsquo;t helping either. You both were back to\ntexting and calling at random hours of the day. You had to scold yourself for\nbeing on your phone so much at work. It was hard to reprimand your intern if\nyou were texting more than he was. </p><p>Chris had begged you to spend the\nnight at his house the last two nights, but you were sticking to your guns. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only two more days Chris. We can\nmake it. I didn&rsquo;t see you for a full month and we survived that.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a\nmonth!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You sighed. Even though you were the one not budging, it was hard on\nyour too.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I know. You&rsquo;re right. Can&rsquo;t you come over for a little while\nthough?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;We both know I won&rsquo;t end up leaving. Dodger\nwill cuddle with me and I&rsquo;ll fall asleep. It&rsquo;s already after eleven.&rdquo; You let\nout a laugh and you heard him slightly chuckle as well.</p><p>That night in the park where you had\nconfessed your feelings for each other, he insisted on walking you home. Hand in\nhand. It was sweet and romantic with the sun setting in the distance. He walked\nyou up the stairs to your door. Turning to face him, you leaned in for a kiss\nand then pulled back to say goodnight. Chris grabbed the back your head to hold\nyou in place which caused you to start giggling. Once you started you couldn&rsquo;t\nstop. He laid his head on your shoulder and joined you.</p><p>&ldquo;This is how it&rsquo;s going to be, isn&rsquo;t\nit?&rdquo; He asked. Smile evident in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure you know the answer\nto that by now. I hope this doesn&rsquo;t charge your mind.&rdquo;</p><p>He lifted his head and looked you in\nthe eyes. He gave you a chaste kiss. &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; Kiss &ldquo;Not.&rdquo; Kiss &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Kiss\n&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Kiss &ldquo;Change.&rdquo; Kiss &ldquo;A thing.&rdquo; Kiss</p><p>You circled your arms around his waist\nand caught your breath. He wrapped his arms around you and buried his head in\nyour hair. </p><p>&ldquo;Can we stay over tonight?&rdquo; You pulled\nback to look at his face to get a read on if he was serious or not. &ldquo;Or you can\npack a bag and we can go to mine.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>You let out a breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think\nthat&rsquo;s a good idea. We talked about doing this right. I think sleeping over\nwithout even having a date first is jumping ahead.&rdquo; </p><p>He grabbed your hand in both of his\nand rubbed it gently. &ldquo;I do want to do this right, but we&rsquo;ve slept over at our\nplaces plenty of times.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but that was as friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t friends anymore?&rdquo; Eyebrows\nraised with a serious expression on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop. You know that&rsquo;s not true. You\nare my friend.&rdquo; He pulled your hand to his lips and kissed it. &ldquo;But I think we\nneed to take a step back from the sleeping over thing. Just for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded solemnly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be\na long four days.&rdquo; </p><p>You kissed each cheek and then kissed\nhis lips long and slow. You rested your forehead on his and then kissed his\nnose before unlocking your door and saying goodnight. </p><p>The next\nnight you were working late with Victoria in the office. You were coordinating a\nwedding that weekend and you were tasked with rearranging the seating chart as\nthe bride had officially given up and the groom didn&rsquo;t want to be involved.\nThere had been a falling out between the bride&rsquo;s mother and father. They had\nbeen divorced for a number of years but tensions had picked up due to the\nincreasing budget. Mr. Schmitt and the former Mrs. Schmitt no longer agreed to\nbe seated at the same table. Because the wedding was already so large, there was\nno room to add an additional table. You planned to come up with four optional\nchanges to resolve the seating crisis and send it to the bride tomorrow. You\nhad three, but couldn&rsquo;t come up with the fourth. Your goal was to be home by\nnine, but it was already ten. Chris had been texting you, but you hadn&rsquo;t been\nable to look or respond for the last hour. </p><p>A knocking at the door got your and Victoria&rsquo;s attention. It&rsquo;s an event coordinating\noffice, you usually didn&rsquo;t have visitors and it was well after delivery hours. You\nstood up and motioned for Victoria to join you as you both crept to the front\nof the office. The door is glass with no shade so you easily spotted Chris on\nthe other side of the door. </p><p>\n\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Chris doing here?&rdquo; Victoria asked. \n\n\n\n</p><p>Deciding to\nkeep this new relationship between the two of you for a while, Victoria did not\nknow about the kissing or the date tomorrow night. </p><p>You shrugged\nyour shoulders as you walked to the door. Victoria staying by the reception\ndesk. &ldquo;He was texting me, but I haven&rsquo;t had time to read them.&rdquo; </p><p>You unlocked\nthe door and opened it for him to enter. You subtly nodded your head back in Victoria&rsquo;s\ndirection so that he wouldn&rsquo;t greet you with a kiss. He gave you a wink and\nraised his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi\nVictoria. Great to see you again.&rdquo;</p><p>She walked\ntoward the two of you and gave him a hug. <i>Everyone&rsquo;s a hugger in this town.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I hope you\ndon&rsquo;t mind me borrowing Y/N for a minute.&rdquo;</p><p>She giggled.\n&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ll just be in there.&rdquo; Victoria pointed to the conference room\nin the back corner that you two were occupying and hurriedly walked away.</p><p>&ldquo;What are\nyou doing here? Not that I&rsquo;m not happy to see you.&rdquo; You leaned in for a kiss\nbut he was hesitant. &ldquo;Chris, babe, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; <i>Babe? I sure like that\nword apparently.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry\nfor just showing up here, but I really needed to talk to you.&rdquo; You nodded and\nmotioned to the overstuffed chairs near the door. You both took a seat as you\nfelt your heart rate increase. Was he already having doubts? Did he want to\ncancel your date and thought it best to do in person. It had only been three\ndays. What could happen in three days?</p><p>He grabbed\nyour hand. <i>At least this is comforting. &ldquo;</i>There&rsquo;s a story that came out\ntoday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. What\nkind of story?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Someone\ntook some pictures at that bachelor party I went to. There was this girl\nthere.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh boy. </i>If your heart wasn&rsquo;t already pumping\nas fast as it was, you were pretty sure it was setting a record.</p><p>You nodded\nasking that he continue. &ldquo;Nothing happened. I just want to emphasize that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, we\nweren&rsquo;t together then. I mean, we&rsquo;re barely together now.&rdquo; You were being\nhonest. Yeah, it hurt you a bit that he hooked up with some random woman at the\nparty, but he&rsquo;s not yours to claim. You hadn&rsquo;t even had the discussion about\nseeing each other until a couple days after that party. </p><p>\n\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to come back to that comment about\nnot being together now, but I want to explain myself first.&rdquo; He said, eyebrows\nfurrowed. &ldquo;There were a few girls that sat in our section at the club. Some of\nthe other guys let them up. This particular woman wanted a picture so she sat\non my lap to take it. We took a couple of selfies together. She kissed my cheek\nin one. One of her friends or someone else took a picture of the two of us from\na distance and in that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npicture\nit looks like her and I are kissing. A story came out today with the pictures\nsaying her and I are an item. I don&rsquo;t even know her name.&rdquo; He took a breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nimportant to me that you believe me.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p>You shake\nyour head. Of course, you believed him. You didn&rsquo;t think he would lie about\nsomething like this. &ldquo;Chris, I believe you.&rdquo; He looked surprised. He reached out\nand stroked your cheek. You couldn&rsquo;t help but lean in. &ldquo;Even if it were true,\nwe hadn&rsquo;t seen each other in a month, you&rsquo;re allowed to be with other women.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But I was\nbeing honest with you when I said I wasn&rsquo;t hooking up.&rdquo; He moved his other hand\nto your face and held it with both hands. &ldquo;Sweetheart, I didn&rsquo;t want to be with\nanyone else. I hope this doesn&rsquo;t make me sound like an asshole, but when you\nand Tim broke up, I held out hope that one day you&rsquo;d forgive me and we could be\ntogether.&rdquo; </p><p>You closed\nyour eyes and shook your head. &ldquo;Well aren&rsquo;t you lucky that your wish came\ntrue.&rdquo;</p><p>He stood up,\ngiving you a hand to help you stand up. He pulled you close and hugged you\naround your waist. &ldquo;I just wanted to tell you in person in case you saw\nsomething online.&rdquo; &nbsp; </p><p>You leaned\nin capturing his lips in a quick kiss before pulling back. &ldquo;Thank you for\ntelling me. I hate to kick you out, but I really need to wrap today up.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled\nand pulled you back in for another hug. You walked him to the door and locked\nup, promising to see him tomorrow for your date. Now to come up with a lie to\ntell Victoria why he was there.</p><p>On your\nlunch break the next day, you pulled up Google and typed in Chris Evans.\nWithout a doubt, you one hundred percent believed that he didn&rsquo;t hook up with\nthat woman, but you were curious.

But that felt weird so you sat on your couch.\nFeet planted on the ground and hunched forward. Then you crossed your legs and\nleaned back trying to relax. Shoes! You should probably have your shoes on. You\nquickly walked to your closet and took out the new paid of black sling backs\nyou purchased the other day. You really should have broken them in first, but\nyou frankly had no time. Once the second shoe was in place, you heard a knock\nat your door. Grabbing your wrap and handbag, you opened the door to a very nicely\ndressed Chris. He had on a black suit with a white button-down sans tie and he\nlooked good enough to eat.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. You\nlook&hellip;wow. You look beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>You lowered\nyour head bashfully and smiled. &ldquo;Thank you. You also look beautiful.&rdquo; You\nlaughed. &ldquo;I mean, you look great.&rdquo; He smiled and reached for your hand. It was\nlike this was your first time meeting. Nerves were getting the best of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nready to go?&rdquo; He asked. You nodded and followed him out the door. </p><p>The\nrestaurant Chris chose was called n/naka. You weren&rsquo;t sure how to pronounce it,\nbut Chris had texted you the name so you could look it up to get an idea of the\nvibe. Apparently, it was one of those places that was extremely hard to get\ninto. Chris had the car valet parked and helped you out of the car. He gave the\nhost his name and she escorted you to the table with Chris&rsquo; hand on the small\nof your back the whole way. </p><p>The\nrestaurant was beautiful with low lights and clean lines. The tables were a\nlittle close together for your liking, but you only had eyes for Chris anyway.</p><p>The server\nappeared at your table and informed you the menu was a prefix 13 course dinner.\nYour eyes widened and you instantly regretted the pasta lunch. Your server,\nJoseph, asked if you wanted to do the wine pairing. You looked to Chris who\nnodded at the server. </p><p>The wine\narrived first. You weren&rsquo;t a wine expert by any means, but it was red and\ndelish. </p><p>Chris held\nup his glass and you followed suit. &ldquo;To a lovely evening with a lovely lady.\nAnd to many more.&rdquo; You clinked your glass to his and made sure to keep eye\ncontact as you took a sip. Chris somehow managed to cough as he took his sip\nand promptly spilled the offending wine down the front of his white dress\nshirt. Your hands immediately covered your mouth as you scanned the restaurant\nfor your server who apparently had seen the incident along with several other\npatrons. Chris started to laugh and you did as well. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I did\nthat!&rdquo;</p><p>Joseph\nappeared with a glass of club soda and an extra napkin. Chris immediately began\nto work on the stain, but it wasn&rsquo;t coming out. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.\nRed&rsquo;s a good color on you.&rdquo; You said with a wink. </p><p>His cheeks\nbecame rosy and he gave a bashful smile. </p><p>The first\nthree courses came out fast and were quickly eaten up. You were worried when\nJoseph said there would be thirteen, but each course wasn&rsquo;t much more than a\nbite. Thinly sliced veggies and meats decorated like a piece of art on a plate.\nYou tried desperately to keep an open mind and try each dish even when you\ndidn&rsquo;t know what it was. Several of the dishes were seafood which you generally\nliked, but you were more of a fish and chips or shrimp kind of girl. These\ndishes were seared tuna and pickled cod. You were trying every dish because Chris had gone\nto so much effort in planning the date. If this was his type of thing, you wanted\nto be able to enjoy it with him. </p><p>It was when\nthe tenth dish came out that things took a turn for the worse. The beautifully\nplated dish had some sort of meat on it, but you weren&rsquo;t sure what it was.\nChris seemed to eat his piece with no problem, so you figured you could do the\nsame. You pierced the small piece of meat and slid it through the sauce that\ndecorated the plate. Bringing the fork to your mouth you took a tentative bite.\nThe sauce had a good flavor, but the texture of the meat almost made you gag.\nWith it still in your mouth, you inhaled through your nose slowly and went to\nchew again. But you couldn&rsquo;t. The texture was too much and you gaged. Like\ngaged out loud that Chris and the table next to you heard. Your face instantly\nheated. Grabbing your napkin, you brought it to your mouth, trying to elegantly\nspit it into the napkin. Update, there is no real true way to elegantly do\nthat, besides Chris was watching with concern.</p><p>You grabbed\nyour glass of white and promptly drank it down. Once it was empty you looked to\nChris. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I&rsquo;m so embarrassed!&rdquo; He reached for your hand and shook\nhis head politely. &ldquo;What was that?!&rdquo;</p><p>Chris\nchuckled softly. &ldquo;I think it was eel.&rdquo; He shrugged as he said that.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s\nsafe to say I don&rsquo;t like eel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I actually\ndidn&rsquo;t care for it either.&rdquo;</p><p>You started\nto giggle which turned into full belly laughs when Chris joined in. The other\npatrons did not look amused, but it this point, neither of you cared. </p><p>&ldquo;What are we\ndoing here Chris? This so isn&rsquo;t us.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t. I honestly have no idea what I was\nthinking.&rdquo; You squeezed his hand and he did the same.\n\n\n\n</p><p>With the\nremaining courses you stuck to the vegetables on the plate if you could not\nidentify the meat as one you liked. </p><p>Chris paid\nthe bill and the two of you walked out, wine stain and all. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nstill hungry by chance?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>You looked\nto him with bright eyes. &ldquo;Oh my God yes!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of\nyou went through the drive thru at In-N-Out Burger and ate your food in the parking\nlot. When you finished your burger, you were completely stuffed. </p><p>Chris drove\nyou home and walked you to your door. You were tempted to invite him in because\nyou didn&rsquo;t want the evening to end. However, you didn&rsquo;t want the implication\nthat you wanted things to go further tonight. After all, Chris is the one who\nsaid he wanted to woo you. </p><p>&ldquo;Despite me\ngagging during dinner, I had a really good time with you tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The first\nglass of wine dripping down my shirt didn&rsquo;t ruin the evening?&rdquo; He asked, a\nsmall smile on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. Not\nat all.&rdquo; You said. Taking a step closer to him, you put your hands on the\nlapels of his jacket.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m\nglad to hear it. I hope I can see you again.&rdquo; Speaking softer now, all joking\nforgotten.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really\nlike that. In fact, I&rsquo;d like to see you tomorrow if you can pencil me in.&rdquo;</p><p>He brushed\nhis lips against yours in a barely there kiss. &ldquo;I think that sounds like a\ngreat idea. How about you come over in comfy clothes? I&rsquo;ll order a pizza and\nwill watch a movie.&rdquo;</p><p>You brushed\nyour lips against his and pulled back. You nodded your head and bit you lower\nlip. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo; He\nasked.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmhmm.&rdquo;\nKiss &ldquo;I like the sound of that.&rdquo; Kiss</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a\ndate.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nthink I&rsquo;ll ever get tired of hearing that.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll\nnever stop saying this.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Could he\nbe any more perfect?</i></p><p>\n\nChris pushed his fingers through your hair,\ngently embracing the back of your head and pulling you in for a kiss. It was\nmore needy than the ones before. You parted your lips to grant him entrance\nwhich he greedily took. His tongue exploring your mouth which caused you to\nmoan. He groaned in reply and you suddenly wished you had invited him in. His\nbeard rubbed against your skin deliciously, but you were sure your face would\nbe red when you said goodnight.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t\nuntil Chris pulled back to take a breath did you regain your composure. You\nleaned forward and kissed his nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;\nYou said.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You unlocked\nyour door and hesitantly went inside, turning back to see Chris standing there\nwith his hands in his pockets, a soft grin on his face.</p><p>After\nchanging for bed and putting on HGTV to wind down, your phone dinged with a\nmessage from Chris.</p><p><b>Chris:</b>\nGoodnight sweetheart&nbsp;</p><p><b>Y/N:</b> Goodnight babe\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://jamielea81.tumblr.com/post/185543618602/a-walk-in-the-park\">Chapter 19</a></p><p><b>Tag List:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moWlXU_tkFGl50_6o7QzSDQ\">@lookwhatyoumademequeue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvfaKCaSRME5COH2CQ6-ovA\">@crimeshowtrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JrTGsFTiMAO9fKLcL-lvQ\">@cocomel0613</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6DSHP6G1vpP7li5LmR6CQ\">@flamencodiva</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKdHrEp3ArmzlDlksyCfjEg\">@thefandomzoneisdangerous</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m32gA_h2XVKj-lmfoTHN9nw\">@maddie-laufeyson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnPlqAPa7IwakHwqFG5A5Q\">@shameless-pope</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m639hcuSi1UGZxR0GtJGL-A\">@pivans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrbVOq7dBun4OlAYbNJYUA\">@symonlyjen5</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQpaow9hD50-M6p3h_4v4A\">@inlovewith3</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5sxGUUI1xQXrPWP8Y2Frg\">@fanfiiiiiiics</a><b>&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNpq6fCujEef3jJxaomtzZA\">@violetadefebrero</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLMzGhcPlZ6nf01yyvdOnOQ\">@not-another-tmblr</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXZKEpKJPMCLdMnz0gqteXA\">@thenormreedus</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfHeOC5QKdkvC5il44pAkvA\">@ly-cia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJa6FroirmgJOdcmN1nJ7XQ\">@estillion14</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-20P6Yp67PXawboI2n8Ryw\">@chita0027</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBxf4DMfA5y6VQvTy4-MRXA\">@smoothdogsgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m12_H4vOR6Yg6oQ7DIkgl1w\">@the&ndash;blackdahlia</a></b></p>",

Four, long, torturous days. After your night in the\npark, he had to work the next two days on re-recording some audio for a movie\nhe had filmed a few months back. Luckily for him and yourself, he just had to\ngo to the studio, no flight out of state needed. Unfortunately, it was long\nhours for him, and your schedule wasn&rsquo;t helping either. You both were back to\ntexting and calling at random hours of the day. You had to scold yourself for\nbeing on your phone so much at work. It was hard to reprimand your intern if\nyou were texting more than he was. </p>\n</p>",
