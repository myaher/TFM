In a bed with a human woman, watching her stretch in the nude similar yet&hellip;not as impressive as she demonstrated a few hours ago. \u201cSo\u2026.that was fun.\u201d Keg chuckled awkwardly breaking the silence as she slowly sat up from the bed, shaking off the linens from her bare, scar covered body. Her muscles ached, they had no rest not between battle and play. \u201cYou\u2019re very uh\u2026\u201d she paused as Beau slowly righted herself from a downward stretch, curling her spine up into a perfect postured stand. \u201cBendy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYea\u201d Beau didn\u2019t even try to not sound smug. Just the look of her smirk made Keg shift back to bed an inch more. \u201cIt&rsquo;s kinda&hellip;a monk thing.\u201d Beauregard walked over and stood by the edge of the bed. Her hands slowly moving up and down the tight, thick barrel like arms of the dwarvian woman she invited to her bed last night. \u201cI might have shown off a bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYea that thing you did&hellip;I thought you were going to split in half, I didn\u2019t know legs could DO that\u201d Keg chuckled with a growing blush. A small purr erupted from her as Beau\u2019s hands moved up her hair covered arms to her scruffed chin. </p><p>The dark skinned human woman smirked, her eyes gleamed with mischief as she leaned in a bit closer. \u201cHey&hellip;just celebrating a job well done.\u201d </p><p>Keg welcomed her kiss. Days of being around her she wasn\u2019t disappointed now that she finally got to experience Beauregard and all her&hellip;forms. She saw her rage, her power, her softness and vulnerabilities. Last night she saw passion and a subtle desire to be cared for. This was an addicting sort of feeling. The warmth that brewed in her stout gut like fresh ale. </p><p>Just as fast as the warm emptied into her gut from Beau\u2019s mouth, it left. As the human girl looked out at the day with a sudden stern expression. She pulled a ribbon from the ground and began pulling her hair up into its signature bun, exposing her undercut. \u201cSo, have you figured out what you\u2019re doing next?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Keg slowly began to move now. Seeing Beauregard slowly fish for clothing from the room made her uneasy, as though she too, had to start. \u201cBut I feel less shitty about it. I figure I\u2019ll find some work, make some money&hellip;maybe&hellip;what\u2019s that thing you and Caleb mentioned? The thing&hellip;you\u2019re uh&hellip;friend use to say.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2018Leave a town better than you left it\u2019\u201d Beau answered softly. \u201cYea&hellip;that\u2019s a solid quarter of a plan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was &hellip;also thinking, if you guys are done here&hellip;maybe&hellip;you&rsquo;d want to come with me?\u201d Keg paused to look at Beau\u2019s reaction. Her body stopped for a second and Keg felt her insides curl into itself. \u201cIt was a stupid idea&hellip;you have your friends and your business\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Beauregard muttered. \u201cWe just got them back&hellip;and we\u2019re not all here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat&hellip;do you mean?\u201d Keg paused, \u201cyou saved your friends from Lorenzo, the fight is over.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe fight is, but they\u2019re still weak and we still have to handle Mollymauk\u2019s&hellip;thing.\u201d Beau looked over at Keg. \u201cWhen Jester and Fjord and&hellip;oh god, when Yasha finds out\u2026\u201d Beauregard slowly began to rub the back of her neck in slow, almost thoughtful motions. \u201cYasha\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas she&hellip;the big lady? In the cage by herself.\u201d Keg inquired a bit, Beau\u2019s face lit up with a slight flush, she nodded slow. \u201cI mean I\u2019d stick around but I\u2019m not sure&hellip;if I wanna be around for any sort of crazy magic shit&hellip;I was kinda thrown off by last night\u2019s battle with Lorenzo and all that crap he pulled out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKeg, the idea of running off with you or any girl sounds great. And trust me if you asked me like&hellip;I dunno a few weeks ago even, I might have skipped off on these guys. But I can\u2019t now. Jester and Fjord are real beaten up&hellip;Caleb is constantly getting hurt, Nott is a shifty little fuck, Dueces is way to new to be left alone with any of them and Yasha&hellip;she\u2026.she needs uh&hellip;she needs us more now that we\u2019re down one.\u201d </p><p>Keg\u2019s eyes scanned over Beauregard a few times. She slowly moved to picking up her bigger pieces of armor, nodding slow as Beau explained herself. \u201cYour friends are important to you. I respect that.\u201d She paused as she slung on her heavy chest armor. \u201cEspecially that Yasha.\u201d Her chapped lips curled into a smirk that disarmed Beau. </p><p>She tried to recompose herself, failing at tying her own sash out of frustration. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not like that, Yasha&hellip;she\u2019s not into me\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d </p><p>Beauregard pursed her lips a little, giving Keg a little glare. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Keg began to laugh, before covering her mouth, remembering the rest of nein were only a room away. \u201cIt&rsquo;s kinda obvious. Here I thought you were pretty slick with your sweet talking.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTch, well&hellip;let\u2019s just say I haven\u2019t found a way to talk Yasha into my bed&hellip;there\u2019ll be less of that now that all this is happening&hellip;the fight is over but we still have so much damage control&hellip;so much to do\u2026.\u201d Beau smiled a sort of somber, desperate smile. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to be the same&hellip;I have no idea what comes after this and I was hoping last night could &hellip;I don\u2019t fucking know, last a little longer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cToday was going to come whether we wanted to or not. The world still spins, but at least you\u2019re not going back.\u201d Keg finally pieced up her last bit of armor and began walking out of the room, as Beau, now dressed as well walked after her. \u201cSeeing me out?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah&hellip;just have somewhere to be.\u201d She patted Keg\u2019s back. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, if I see any weird, freaky trouble I\u2019ll just assume the Mighty Nein is nearby.\u201d Keg chortled disappearing around the hall. </p><p>Beauregard watched her with a small smile before turning to the room across from her. Her smile faded as she entered finding Nott, curled up by Jester and Fjord\u2019s side. Caleb, sleeping on the floor, hand clutching a heart shaped pendant on his neck. Somewhere Cadueces was probably outside making tea or feeding his insects in the meantime. </p><p>In a bed all of her own, Yasha\u2019s massive frame, built and bruised laid there, sleeping soundly. </p><p>With a shaky breath Beau went to her, kneeling down by her bed. She gently took Molly\u2019s tarot cards and placed it on the nightstand by the bed with a pained smile. \u201cWe brought them home&hellip;so you don\u2019t have to worry\u201d She muttered softly, as moisture welled in her eyes. Her body froze when she felt a large hand curl around her face in a tender touch. She felt her heart race and sink down all at once, her eyes wide and out pouring as Yasha\u2019s eyes were barely opened all the way, but staring her down. </p><p>\u201cBeau?\u201d She croaked. \u201cB-Beau is &hellip;is uh&hellip;that you?\u201d Yasha tried to move and winced a bit. </p><p>\u201cYea, yea it&rsquo;s me\u201d Beauregard quickly placed her hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re all here&hellip;and we\u2019re safe.\u201d She paused feeling her words run rancid in her mouth. \u201cWell&hellip;almost all of us\u2026\u201d Her hand softly land over the top of the tarot cards. </p>",

The thing\u2026you\u2019re uh\u2026friend use to say.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2018Leave a town better than you left it\u2019\u201d Beau answered softly. \u201cYea\u2026that\u2019s a solid quarter of a plan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was \u2026also thinking, if you guys are done here\u2026maybe\u2026you\u2019d want to come with me?\u201d Keg paused to look at Beau\u2019s reaction. Her body stopped for a second and Keg felt her insides curl into itself. \u201cIt was a stupid idea\u2026you have your friends and your business\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Beauregard muttered. \u201cWe just got them back\u2026and we\u2019re not all here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026do you mean?\u201d Keg paused, \u201cyou saved your friends from Lorenzo, the fight is over.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe fight is, but they\u2019re still weak and we still have to handle Mollymauk\u2019s\u2026thing.\u201d Beau looked over at Keg. \u201cWhen Jester and Fjord and\u2026oh god, when Yasha finds out\u2026\u201d Beauregard slowly began to rub the back of her neck in slow, almost thoughtful motions. \u201cYasha\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas she\u2026the big lady? In the cage by herself.\u201d Keg inquired a bit, Beau\u2019s face lit up with a slight flush, she nodded slow. \u201cI mean I\u2019d stick around but I\u2019m not sure\u2026if I wanna be around for any sort of crazy magic shit\u2026I was kinda thrown off by last night\u2019s battle with Lorenzo and all that crap he pulled out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKeg, the idea of running off with you or any girl sounds great. And trust me if you asked me like\u2026I dunno a few weeks ago even, I might have skipped off on these guys. But I can\u2019t now. Jester and Fjord are real beaten up\u2026Caleb is constantly getting hurt, Nott is a shifty little fuck, Dueces is way to new to be left alone with any of them and Yasha\u2026she\u2026.she needs uh\u2026she needs us more now that we\u2019re down one.\u201d </p><p>Keg\u2019s eyes scanned over Beauregard a few times. She slowly moved to picking up her bigger pieces of armor, nodding slow as Beau explained herself. \u201cYour friends are important to you. I respect that.\u201d She paused as she slung on her heavy chest armor. \u201cEspecially that Yasha.\u201d Her chapped lips curled into a smirk that disarmed Beau. </p><p>She tried to recompose herself, failing at tying her own sash out of frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Yasha\u2026she\u2019s not into me\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d </p><p>Beauregard pursed her lips a little, giving Keg a little glare. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Keg began to laugh, before covering her mouth, remembering the rest of nein were only a room away. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda obvious. Here I thought you were pretty slick with your sweet talking.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTch, well\u2026let\u2019s just say I haven\u2019t found a way to talk Yasha into my bed\u2026there\u2019ll be less of that now that all this is happening\u2026the fight is over but we still have so much damage control\u2026so much to do\u2026.\u201d Beau smiled a sort of somber, desperate smile. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to be the same\u2026I have no idea what comes after this and I was hoping last night could \u2026I don\u2019t fucking know, last a little longer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cToday was going to come whether we wanted to or not. The world still spins, but at least you\u2019re not going back.\u201d Keg finally pieced up her last bit of armor and began walking out of the room, as Beau, now dressed as well walked after her. \u201cSeeing me out?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah\u2026just have somewhere to be.\u201d She patted Keg\u2019s back. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, if I see any weird, freaky trouble I\u2019ll just assume the Mighty Nein is nearby.\u201d Keg chortled disappearing around the hall. </p><p>Beauregard watched her with a small smile before turning to the room across from her. Her smile faded as she entered finding Nott, curled up by Jester and Fjord\u2019s side. Caleb, sleeping on the floor, hand clutching a heart shaped pendant on his neck. Somewhere Cadueces was probably outside making tea or feeding his insects in the meantime. </p><p>In a bed all of her own, Yasha\u2019s massive frame, built and bruised laid there, sleeping soundly. </p><p>With a shaky breath Beau went to her, kneeling down by her bed. She gently took Molly\u2019s tarot cards and placed it on the nightstand by the bed with a pained smile. \u201cWe brought them home\u2026so you don\u2019t have to worry\u201d She muttered softly, as moisture welled in her eyes. Her body froze when she felt a large hand curl around her face in a tender touch. She felt her heart race and sink down all at once, her eyes wide and out pouring as Yasha\u2019s eyes were barely opened all the way, but staring her down. </p><p>\u201cBeau?\u201d She croaked. \u201cB-Beau is \u2026is uh\u2026that you?\u201d Yasha tried to move and winced a bit. </p><p>\u201cYea, yea it\u2019s me\u201d Beauregard quickly placed her hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re all here\u2026and we\u2019re safe.\u201d She paused feeling her words run rancid in her mouth. \u201cWell\u2026almost all of us\u2026\u201d Her hand softly land over the top of the tarot cards. </p>",

The faint lightening of the night\u2019s dark blues slowly raise in brightness, and soft saturated colors of morning begin to form. Just as the soft padding of feet shuffling in the morning. Clothes and armor being shifted around, as bodies, still moistened by sweat and the encumberments of the night before.<b><br></b></p><p>It was strange riding a low, then a high only to be\u2026at a neutral place.

Her muscles ached, they had no rest not between battle and play. \u201cYou\u2019re very uh\u2026\u201d she paused as Beau slowly righted herself from a downward stretch, curling her spine up into a perfect postured stand. \u201cBendy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYea\u201d Beau didn\u2019t even try to not sound smug. Just the look of her smirk made Keg shift back to bed an inch more. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda\u2026a monk thing.\u201d Beauregard walked over and stood by the edge of the bed.

The world still spins, but at least you&rsquo;re not going back.&rdquo; Keg finally pieced up her last bit of armor and began walking out of the room, as Beau, now dressed as well walked after her. &ldquo;Seeing me out?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nah&hellip;just have somewhere to be.&rdquo; She patted Keg&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a stranger.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry, if I see any weird, freaky trouble I&rsquo;ll just assume the Mighty Nein is nearby.&rdquo; Keg chortled disappearing around the hall. </p><p>Beauregard watched her with a small smile before turning to the room across from her. Her smile faded as she entered finding Nott, curled up by Jester and Fjord&rsquo;s side. Caleb, sleeping on the floor, hand clutching a heart shaped pendant on his neck. Somewhere Cadueces was probably outside making tea or feeding his insects in the meantime. </p><p>In a bed all of her own, Yasha&rsquo;s massive frame, built and bruised laid there, sleeping soundly. </p><p>With a shaky breath Beau went to her, kneeling down by her bed. She gently took Molly&rsquo;s tarot cards and placed it on the nightstand by the bed with a pained smile. &ldquo;We brought them home&hellip;so you don&rsquo;t have to worry&rdquo; She muttered softly, as moisture welled in her eyes. Her body froze when she felt a large hand curl around her face in a tender touch. She felt her heart race and sink down all at once, her eyes wide and out pouring as Yasha&rsquo;s eyes were barely opened all the way, but staring her down. </p><p>&ldquo;Beau?&rdquo; She croaked. &ldquo;B-Beau is &hellip;is uh&hellip;that you?&rdquo; Yasha tried to move and winced a bit. </p><p>&ldquo;Yea, yea it&rsquo;s me&rdquo; Beauregard quickly placed her hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all here&hellip;and we&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo; She paused feeling her words run rancid in her mouth. &ldquo;Well&hellip;almost all of us&hellip;&rdquo; Her hand softly land over the top of the tarot cards. </p>",
