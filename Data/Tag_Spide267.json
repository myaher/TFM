The boss of the tutorial is Kingpin, a big, beefy bastard who can\u2019t be punched normally.

Fair enough, he\u2019s a boss, and also a major, named villain. But then roaming gangs of thugs add big fellas to their roster who all behave exactly like Kingpin in combat. Every single one of my combat deaths have been to a Brute who wore me down with punches from off-screen while I was dealing with the other annoying enemy types.

I just click in the right stick and then swing the camera around until I see a nearby backpack/landmark icon.</li></ul>",

Fair enough, he\u2019s a boss, and also a major, named villain. But then roaming gangs of thugs add big fellas to their roster who all behave exactly like Kingpin in combat.

A bitter breeze nipped at your ears and you pulled your grey beanie down to stop it. Arms crossed, and hands tucked into armpits, your torso was covered by a baggy orange hoodie, matching some of the fiery leaves scattered everywhere. Your breath fanned out in front of you, a whisper of fog curling into the air.</p><p>Harsh ringing disturbed the quiet. Numb fingers scrambled to open your bag. You reached for your phone, unlocked it, and accepted the call.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter,\u201d you said. The way your boyfriend\u2019s name rolled off your tongue always made a smile fleet across your lips.</p><p>\u201cHi, Y/N.\u201d There was a loud crashing sound. \u201cNed! What are you doing?\u201d He chuckled at some words you could barely make out. \u201cYou haven\u2019t left yet, have you? I\u2019m at Ned\u2019s, doing some project we forgot about. Did you get my text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually. I didn\u2019t.\u201d You rolled your eyes and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m outside your block of flats, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Peter groaned. \u201cShit, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d you muttered, forcing a smile he couldn\u2019t even see. \u201cIs May in? It\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019ll let you in. Give me half an hour and I\u2019ll be back. I\u2019m so sorry, Y/N,\u201d he managed to garble out, before hanging up.</p><p>To say you were annoyed would be an understatement. Exhaling heavily through your nose, you entered the lobby and ran up the stairs in an attempt to calm yourself down. You knocked on the door and May answered almost instantly. </p><p>\u201cHi, Y/N! I\u2019m just going shopping, so try not to wreck the place whilst I\u2019m out.\u201d Laughing, she sent you a wink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d you replied, offering her a fake laugh.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having Chinese tonight, if you\u2019re interested,\u201d she smiled. Then, she changed the subject. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you here in a while.\u201d The last sentence was more of a subtle question than a statement.</p><p>You shrugged awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ve had loads of homework and this massive project for my Spanish coursework that I should have started months ago. It\u2019s my fault, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stay for dinner,\u201d May said. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have more company. Well, I\u2019ll see you later, hopefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d you grinned, feeling much better than when Peter told you he would be late.</p><p>Brushing past whilst putting her coat on, May vanished down the stairs. The door shutting behind you with a gentle click, you entered the apartment. Making your way to Peter\u2019s room, you gazed fondly at yours and his initials inside a heart engraved into his door. Softly, you traced the indentations with your fingertip. May only pretended to be annoyed when she first saw it, but secretly thought it was sweet. </p><p>A strong chemical smell hit you when you opened the door. Spluttering, you dodged all the crap on his floor and flung open a window, gulping in the fresh air. The stench was coming from his bedside cabinet, so you pulled a draw open tentatively, considering the possibility that he\u2019d spilled something on his clothes in science, but what you discovered made you confused.</p><p>There was a clear tube with a stopper on it filled with white liquid. Around it, were little packets of chemicals and a few notes stained with said chemicals. Deciding to let Peter explain himself, you started to close the draw, and stopped when you saw the words \u2018Web Fluid Version 4.02\u2019 scrawled across a piece of paper. </p><p>Something was up. Peter<i> never</i> kept secrets from you. Or, so you had thought.</p><p>Curiosity overwhelmed you after a few minutes of registering everything inside your head and your attention was caught by a loose ceiling tile by the door. You gently wiggled it and it fell down, alongside a red suit, decorated with \u2013 webs?</p><p>\u201cPeter, what the hell are you up to?\u201d you whispered, holding up the suit to examine it. </p><p>\u201cY/N, what are you doing?\u201d Peter stood in the doorframe, watching you with horror written across his face. He walked over and snatched the suit from your hands. \u201cWhy are you looking through my stuff?\u201d</p><p>You simply gaped at him. \u201cI-\u201d You swallowed. \u201cI smelt the chemicals for your \u2018Web Fluid\u2019 or whatever you called it and I wanted to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have asked me?\u201d he demanded, almost angrily. \u201cInstead of thinking: \u2018Oh, let me investigate and violate my boyfriend\u2019s privacy\u2019?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen explain yourself,\u201d you said hotly, eyes narrowed. \u201cBut I\u2019m not stupid, so I think you don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>Peter collapsed onto his bed, breathing noisily in frustration. Pulling your hair anxiously, you paced his room. When the silence became unbearable, you blurted: \u201cYou\u2019re the Spider-Man?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. There was no emotion in your voice, which scared him more than any villain could. </p><p>\u201cYou could have died, Peter,\u201d you murmured. You raised your voice suddenly, until you were screaming. \u201cYou\u2019re so selfish!\u201d </p><p>Staring at you incredulously, he sat bolt upright. \u201cI\u2019m so <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were on the boat. You stopped the Vulture. You were at the Deli when it got pulverised. What if you had died, huh?\u201d Your voice broke. \u201cWhat about <i>me</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Y/N, it\u2019s okay.\u201d You flung yourself into his arms and his voice faded to a quiet murmur in your ear. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>You pulled away, tears streaking down your cheeks. A frown furrowed your eyebrows. \u201cBut what if you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, I swear, it\u2019s okay!\u201d Peter said, trying to pull you into his comforting embrace again.</p><p>\u201cBut<i> I\u2019m</i> not okay with you risking your life. I don\u2019t care if you say you\u2019re safe, there\u2019s always a chance you won\u2019t come home. I don\u2019t want to wake up one morning and have you kiss me goodbye and never come back because that\u2019s too sad and I don\u2019t want you to die, Peter.\u201d You were crying loudly now. Sobs wracked through your body and he pulled you into his arms, stroking your hair. Your voice sounded scratched, like a broken record, when you sobbed: \u201cPlease don\u2019t die, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter gazed at you, his fingers still playing with your hair. \u201cY/N, look at me. I promise I won\u2019t die. That suit is amazing and it\u2019s saved my life more times than I care to count. Being Spider-Man makes me a hero. But I\u2019ll always be <i>your</i> hero. And you\u2019ll always be mine.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to your forehead and cupped your jaw, making your eyes meet. Heart fluttering like a bird trapped in a cage, he wrapped his arms around you tightly, your bodies melting into each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always come home, Y/N.\u201d</p>",

A bitter breeze nipped at your ears and you pulled your grey beanie down to stop it. Arms crossed, and hands tucked into armpits, your torso was covered by a baggy orange hoodie, matching some of the fiery leaves scattered everywhere. Your breath fanned out in front of you, a whisper of fog curling into the air.</p><p>Harsh ringing disturbed the quiet. Numb fingers scrambled to open your bag. You reached for your phone, unlocked it, and accepted the call.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter,\u201d you said. The way your boyfriend\u2019s name rolled off your tongue always made a smile fleet across your lips.</p><p>\u201cHi, Y/N.\u201d There was a loud crashing sound. \u201cNed! What are you doing?\u201d He chuckled at some words you could barely make out. \u201cYou haven\u2019t left yet, have you? I\u2019m at Ned\u2019s, doing some project we forgot about. Did you get my text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually. I didn\u2019t.\u201d You rolled your eyes and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m outside your block of flats, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Peter groaned. \u201cShit, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d you muttered, forcing a smile he couldn\u2019t even see. \u201cIs May in? It\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019ll let you in. Give me half an hour and I\u2019ll be back. I\u2019m so sorry, Y/N,\u201d he managed to garble out, before hanging up.</p><p>To say you were annoyed would be an understatement. Exhaling heavily through your nose, you entered the lobby and ran up the stairs in an attempt to calm yourself down. You knocked on the door and May answered almost instantly. </p><p>\u201cHi, Y/N! I\u2019m just going shopping, so try not to wreck the place whilst I\u2019m out.\u201d Laughing, she sent you a wink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d you replied, offering her a fake laugh.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having Chinese tonight, if you\u2019re interested,\u201d she smiled. Then, she changed the subject. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you here in a while.\u201d The last sentence was more of a subtle question than a statement.</p><p>You shrugged awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ve had loads of homework and this massive project for my Spanish coursework that I should have started months ago. It\u2019s my fault, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stay for dinner,\u201d May said. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have more company. Well, I\u2019ll see you later, hopefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d you grinned, feeling much better than when Peter told you he would be late.</p><p>Brushing past whilst putting her coat on, May vanished down the stairs. The door shutting behind you with a gentle click, you entered the apartment. Making your way to Peter\u2019s room, you gazed fondly at yours and his initials inside a heart engraved into his door. Softly, you traced the indentations with your fingertip. May only pretended to be annoyed when she first saw it, but secretly thought it was sweet. </p><p>A strong chemical smell hit you when you opened the door. Spluttering, you dodged all the crap on his floor and flung open a window, gulping in the fresh air.
