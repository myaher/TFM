They wouldn\u2019t understand how the cool gold felt against his skin. How it <i>tingled</i>. How wearing it made him throb with a longing he couldn\u2019t put into words.</p><p>Ron <i>wanted</i>. He wanted Hermione, but she spent more time on research than on him. He wanted to be safe and not hiding in a musty tent in wet forests. He wanted to see his family again. He wanted a future that didn\u2019t terrify him. But most of all, lately, he wanted someone to love him. If these were the last few weeks or months of his life, he wanted to be <i>touched</i>.</p><p>The others were too busy; absorbed in their \u201chunt\u201d. It\u2019d never end, he knew, not until they confronted Him. Not for Hermione and her unshakable support to the cause, not for Harry and his fervent desire to do the right thing, to do right by his parents, fueling his determination. Neither would ever walk away.</p><p><i>Fools</i>, the locket would whisper in his brain. <i>Fools wasting their time on ideals. Life is for the taking, Ron Weasley.</i></p><p>Ron had never taken things, nor been given them, but the locket gave him something that the others didn\u2019t have: a companion in his mind. Someone who gave voice to his darkest thoughts and accepted him instead of condemning him for them. Someone who took his fears and his worries and soothed him. He was certain the voice didn\u2019t speak to the others. Only to Ron. Ron liked that.</p><p>Hermione poured over a map, Harry was deep in Skeeter\u2019s book, and Ron found refuge in the loo. He locked the door, shoved down his pants and took his cock in his hand. He always did it when it was his turn with the locket, the voice whispering in his mind. It was as if he wanked in front of someone else who was watching. A\u2026 lover. Sharing this most intimate moment with the voice made it all the more thrilling.</p><p><i>Touch yourself, Ron Weasley</i>, the locket would whisper, and the way it drew out the sibilant sounds made Ron\u2019s erection harder. <i>Let me see you.</i></p><p>Ron sat more comfortably, spreading his legs, and pulled on his cock slowly, savouring the gradual build-up of his desire. His other hand strayed on the locket; it caressed the gold cover they couldn\u2019t open.</p><p>Ron often dreamed about what they\u2019d find when they did. He imagined seeing two beautiful blue eyes that burned right through to the very soul of poor, gangly, snubbed Ron with his second-hand books and his shabby robes. Two blue eyes who <i>wanted</i> him. Who wanted to do things to him.</p><p><i>This feels good</i>, the locket would say. <i>I can sense your arousal. It\u2019s\u2026 pleasing to me.</i></p><p>Ron stroked himself harder. \u2018I wish you could touch me,\u2019 he whispered, unsure if he was talking to himself (and unwilling to entertain the thought of <i>who</i> he was talking to if it wasn\u2019t to himself).</p><p><i>Use the locket.</i></p><p>Ron took it off and let the chain fall on his aching cock. He gasped at the touch, and the voice hissed with pleasure<i>. I like this</i>.</p><p>\u2018I do, too,\u2019 Ron said, his veins bursting with arousal. <i>I wish I wasn\u2019t doing this alone</i>, he thought.</p><p><i>You\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m with you.</i></p><p>Ron shut his eyes and tilted his head back. He pictured a sharp, dangerous smile. Blue eyes that gleamed with malice. Beauty that went hand in hand with cruelty. In his mind, the voice belonged to someone powerful, who wanted Ron out of everyone. Someone who had <i>singled out</i> Ron. Not Chosen One Harry or genius Hermione. Not a rich pureblood or a gorgeous one. It was <i>Ron</i> the locket wanted.</p><p>He moaned as the pleasure mounted and rubbed the locket against the leaky head of his cock, the touch searing to his oversensitive nerves.</p><p><i>Come for me</i>, the voice said. <i>Come on me.</i></p><p>\u2018Yes\u2026\u2019 Ron would hiss and he\u2019d come on the locket, stripes of pearly come adorning the heavy gold. It was beautiful, and the locket agreed.</p><p>He hastily cleaned it with a Sourgify, and exited the bathroom.</p><p>Hermione looked up from the map. \u2018You\u2019ve been wearing the locket for too long.

They wouldn\u2019t understand how the cool gold felt against his skin. How it <i>tingled</i>. How wearing it made him throb with a longing he couldn\u2019t put into words.</p><p>Ron <i>wanted</i>. He wanted Hermione, but she spent more time on research than on him. He wanted to be safe and not hiding in a musty tent in wet forests. He wanted to see his family again. He wanted a future that didn\u2019t terrify him. But most of all, lately, he wanted someone to love him. If these were the last few weeks or months of his life, he wanted to be <i>touched</i>.</p><p>The others were too busy; absorbed in their \u201chunt\u201d. It\u2019d never end, he knew, not until they confronted Him. Not for Hermione and her unshakable support to the cause, not for Harry and his fervent desire to do the right thing, to do right by his parents, fueling his determination. Neither would ever walk away.</p><p><i>Fools</i>, the locket would whisper in his brain. <i>Fools wasting their time on ideals. Life is for the taking, Ron Weasley.</i></p><p>Ron had never taken things, nor been given them, but the locket gave him something that the others didn\u2019t have: a companion in his mind. Someone who gave voice to his darkest thoughts and accepted him instead of condemning him for them. Someone who took his fears and his worries and soothed him. He was certain the voice didn\u2019t speak to the others. Only to Ron. Ron liked that.</p><p>Hermione poured over a map, Harry was deep in Skeeter\u2019s book, and Ron found refuge in the loo. He locked the door, shoved down his pants and took his cock in his hand. He always did it when it was his turn with the locket, the voice whispering in his mind. It was as if he wanked in front of someone else who was watching. A\u2026 lover. Sharing this most intimate moment with the voice made it all the more thrilling.</p><p><i>Touch yourself, Ron Weasley</i>, the locket would whisper, and the way it drew out the sibilant sounds made Ron\u2019s erection harder. <i>Let me see you.</i></p><p>Ron sat more comfortably, spreading his legs, and pulled on his cock slowly, savouring the gradual build-up of his desire. His other hand strayed on the locket; it caressed the gold cover they couldn\u2019t open.</p><p>Ron often dreamed about what they\u2019d find when they did. He imagined seeing two beautiful blue eyes that burned right through to the very soul of poor, gangly, snubbed Ron with his second-hand books and his shabby robes. Two blue eyes who <i>wanted</i> him. Who wanted to do things to him.</p><p><i>This feels good</i>, the locket would say. <i>I can sense your arousal. It\u2019s\u2026 pleasing to me.</i></p><p>Ron stroked himself harder. \u2018I wish you could touch me,\u2019 he whispered, unsure if he was talking to himself (and unwilling to entertain the thought of <i>who</i> he was talking to if it wasn\u2019t to himself).</p><p><i>Use the locket.</i></p><p>Ron took it off and let the chain fall on his aching cock. He gasped at the touch, and the voice hissed with pleasure<i>. I like this</i>.</p><p>\u2018I do, too,\u2019 Ron said, his veins bursting with arousal. <i>I wish I wasn\u2019t doing this alone</i>, he thought.</p><p><i>You\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m with you.</i></p><p>Ron shut his eyes and tilted his head back. He pictured a sharp, dangerous smile. Blue eyes that gleamed with malice. Beauty that went hand in hand with cruelty. In his mind, the voice belonged to someone powerful, who wanted Ron out of everyone. Someone who had <i>singled out</i> Ron. Not Chosen One Harry or genius Hermione. Not a rich pureblood or a gorgeous one. It was <i>Ron</i> the locket wanted.</p><p>He moaned as the pleasure mounted and rubbed the locket against the leaky head of his cock, the touch searing to his oversensitive nerves.</p><p><i>Come for me</i>, the voice said. <i>Come on me.</i></p><p>\u2018Yes\u2026\u2019 Ron would hiss and he\u2019d come on the locket, stripes of pearly come adorning the heavy gold. It was beautiful, and the locket agreed.</p><p>He hastily cleaned it with a Sourgify, and exited the bathroom.</p><p>Hermione looked up from the map. \u2018You\u2019ve been wearing the locket for too long.
