Her being a Regent for Rickon would be great, but her entire arc being political makes me more inclined for her to be the sole ruler, instead of Bran or Rickon. GRRM highlighted the fact that there's never been a female ruler of Winterfell multiple times, and if the series doesn't end with a woman as Winterfell's leader (not a consort or a Regent) it would be almost disappointing",
        "answer": "<p>Possible? Certainly. But I\u2019m personally not keen on sacrificing Bran (to the astral plane) and Rickon to have Sansa become Lady of Winterfell. But I\u2019m very attached to the idea that <a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/166825231390/do-you-think-sansa-will-ever-return-home-or-see-wf\" target=\"_blank\">Sansa might be the Stark that holds Winterfell during the thick of the War for the Dawn</a>, and I do think her story arc strongly supports her ruling in some capacity. Personally, I\u2019d love nothing more than for the surviving Starklings to work as a unit post-war. Give me Bran the Rebuilder using his magical knowledge to rebuild Winterfell and the North. Give me Sansa taking on the day-to-day ruling and her ancestors\u2019 historical duty to care and provide for her people. Give me Arya being the North\u2019s protector and warrior. Rebuild, provide and protect. I\u2019m in love with the idea of them being a ruling unit that embodies the very role Winterfell was built for, each with their own area of expertise to reflect their current training montages.<br/></p>",

There the wind blew harshly and the cold cut through the flesh and straight to the bone. Snow flew around making it hard to see or breathe or do much of anything. Winterfell was nothing like that when she arrived. It was bitterly cold but there was a softness to the weather. The snow fell in delicate flurries and rested soft and pillowy on the ground. That softness was reflected in Dany, the way her eyes glistened at the white landscape and the hint of a smile came to her lips.</li><li>Dany isn\u2019t used to the snow or ice. Her balance is off completely and she slips and stumbles in her first few steps. She has too much confidence in her movement and falls flat on her ass in a mound of snow. A horde of people swarmed around her with concern but she waved them all away. The only thing hurt was her pride. She was more careful from then on, falling on her face probably wouldn\u2019t be a very regal first impression. Every once and a while she would begin to slip and would subtly grab onto Jon\u2019s arm with an iron grip. </li><li>Dany doesn\u2019t deal very well with the cold. She prefers the warmth, always has. She\u2019s always close to a fire and sleeps with a pile of blankets the size of a mountain. She notices Missandei is also having a hard time with the cold. Dany notices her friend shivering and shaking. Despite her own coldness, Dany takes off her scarf and offers it to Missandei. Missandei refuses, of course, but Dany insists and wraps the scarf around her. </li><li>One day, on a walk through the grounds, a snowball comes flying through the air towards Dany. Everyone around her bristles protectively. Dany stands in shock as the cold snow melts and trickles down the neck of her coat. Who would dare throw snow at Daenerys Storborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, Rightful Heir to the Iron Throne, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of chains, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea? Arya Stark would. She stood across the courtyard smirking playfully. Everyone around looked on in slight terror of how Dany would retaliate. Well, everyone except Jon. Jon pressed a hand to his mouth and tried to hide his chuckles. Jon\u2019s laughter was enough to lighten Dany up. She knelt down and grabbed a fistful of snow. She tossed it in Arya\u2019s direction but Arya swiftly dodged out of the way. The snowball kept going and crashed straight against Lady Sansa. Sansa initially looked enraged and appalled. But the feelings quickly have way and she couldn\u2019t help but smile. Sansa has grown up playing in the cold north. Sansa returned the fire with a perfectly aimed snowball that crashed right against Dany\u2019s face. Jon couldn\u2019t  hide his laughter anymore and let out a loud chuckle. This drew all attention to him and both Arya and Dany has the same idea. Two snowballs went flying towards him, one hitting his precious hair. Everyone who passed by looked on in awe as some of the most important people in all of the seven kingdoms had a full on snowball fight.</li></ul>",
