With a majority of the day being taken up with school and theatre practice, you don&rsquo;t really get a moment to yourself, so sitting in a room alone at night tends become a comfort. </p><p>Sighing gently she sat on her bed, grabbing the script once again from it&rsquo;s place in the bedside drawer, then proceeding to lay down onto the duvet and open it to the bookmark. She had a little under a month to learn her lines, dances and songs, but she couldn&rsquo;t stop her mind from wondering to her brown haired boyfriend, concentrating has been an issue for the time they have been apart. They have both been busy with different activities, such as Peter being Spiderman and Liana with her musicals, so they haven&rsquo;t had much time to see each other recently. It was taking a big toll on her though, she couldn&rsquo;t concentrate properly, which caused a lot of problems with learning her lines. Rolling her eyes she attempted to focus, before getting back to reading.</p><p>It had been at least an hour of staring at a page blankly, with no progress made at all, before Liana decided just to give up and attempt to get some sleep; maybe she&rsquo;ll have a bit more success in the morning. Sitting back up on the bed she carefully placed the script back into the beside drawer, before getting up to go to the bathroom to brush her teeth in her en-suite bathroom.</p><p>Not having gotten half way through that action, before a loud crash was heard from the room she just left, causing her to come to a stop. She knew her whole family was asleep and her door was locked so they would of had to have come through the window,  meaning that it could be a small amount of options and the most logical was a break in.</p><p>Placing down the tooth brush Liana moved quietly to the door with a pounding heart, she regretted not bringing her phone into the bathroom with her, knowing the only way to escape was through the door in her bedroom. Carefully stepping out of the bathroom, she looked up from the floor expecting to see a stranger, but sighing in relief at the brunette in the red and blue spider suit. She stood up straight crossing her arms slightly while glaring, he had just came in through the window with no warning, at this moment in time she didn&rsquo;t feel to happy to see him.</p><p>&ldquo;If your plan was to make me have a panic attack, you nearly succeeded.&rdquo; She snapped bitterly at him, keeping her voice low as her whole family was asleep, before looking down at the floor slightly to attempt to calm down. When she finally looked up again she could see the sheepish look on his face, a light blush coating his cheeks. A light grin covered her face, she couldn&rsquo;t stay mad at him no matter how hard she tried, carefully she walked up to him, before pulling him into a gentle hug. She looked up at him, with strands of her blonde hair falling in front of her eyes, giving him a light smile before questioning. &ldquo;You know I love your company, but what are you doing here at&hellip;&rdquo; quickly she gave a glance at the clock on the other side of the room. &ldquo;Three in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just really missed talking to you.&rdquo; He said gently, reaching down to ruffle her already messy hair, before wrapping her in his arms and kissing her forehead. &ldquo;I just missed you in general.&rdquo; </p><p>This caused her to lightly giggle before leaning her head into the crook of his neck, letting her body lean into him. This has been the first time she had been able to relax in a while. Gently she reached up,  running her fingers through the hair at the back if his neck, now she remembered why this was her favourite time of day.</p><p><a href=\"http://my-world-of-imagines.tumblr.com/post/178954608212/follower-milestone-writing-challenge\">The writing challenge</a></p>",

With a majority of the day being taken up with school and theatre practice, you don\u2019t really get a moment to yourself, so sitting in a room alone at night tends become a comfort. </p><p>Sighing gently she sat on her bed, grabbing the script once again from it\u2019s place in the bedside drawer, then proceeding to lay down onto the duvet and open it to the bookmark. She had a little under a month to learn her lines, dances and songs, but she couldn\u2019t stop her mind from wondering to her brown haired boyfriend, concentrating has been an issue for the time they have been apart. They have both been busy with different activities, such as Peter being Spiderman and Liana with her musicals, so they haven\u2019t had much time to see each other recently. It was taking a big toll on her though, she couldn\u2019t concentrate properly, which caused a lot of problems with learning her lines. Rolling her eyes she attempted to focus, before getting back to reading.</p><p>It had been at least an hour of staring at a page blankly, with no progress made at all, before Liana decided just to give up and attempt to get some sleep; maybe she\u2019ll have a bit more success in the morning. Sitting back up on the bed she carefully placed the script back into the beside drawer, before getting up to go to the bathroom to brush her teeth in her en-suite bathroom.</p><p>Not having gotten half way through that action, before a loud crash was heard from the room she just left, causing her to come to a stop. She knew her whole family was asleep and her door was locked so they would of had to have come through the window,  meaning that it could be a small amount of options and the most logical was a break in.</p><p>Placing down the tooth brush Liana moved quietly to the door with a pounding heart, she regretted not bringing her phone into the bathroom with her, knowing the only way to escape was through the door in her bedroom. Carefully stepping out of the bathroom, she looked up from the floor expecting to see a stranger, but sighing in relief at the brunette in the red and blue spider suit. She stood up straight crossing her arms slightly while glaring, he had just came in through the window with no warning, at this moment in time she didn\u2019t feel to happy to see him.</p><p>\u201cIf your plan was to make me have a panic attack, you nearly succeeded.\u201d She snapped bitterly at him, keeping her voice low as her whole family was asleep, before looking down at the floor slightly to attempt to calm down. When she finally looked up again she could see the sheepish look on his face, a light blush coating his cheeks. A light grin covered her face, she couldn\u2019t stay mad at him no matter how hard she tried, carefully she walked up to him, before pulling him into a gentle hug. She looked up at him, with strands of her blonde hair falling in front of her eyes, giving him a light smile before questioning. \u201cYou know I love your company, but what are you doing here at\u2026\u201d quickly she gave a glance at the clock on the other side of the room. \u201cThree in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just really missed talking to you.\u201d He said gently, reaching down to ruffle her already messy hair, before wrapping her in his arms and kissing her forehead. \u201cI just missed you in general.\u201d </p><p>This caused her to lightly giggle before leaning her head into the crook of his neck, letting her body lean into him. This has been the first time she had been able to relax in a while. Gently she reached up,  running her fingers through the hair at the back if his neck, now she remembered why this was her favourite time of day.</p><p><a href=\"http://my-world-of-imagines.tumblr.com/post/178954608212/follower-milestone-writing-challenge\">The writing challenge</a></p></p>",
