He has no idea where to begin, doesnt like to do it and ppl would manipulate the shit out of him. Ned part II. He'd be perfect WITH dany ruling alongside him, but we know that makes TOO MUCH SENSE for happening. Anyway, Dany might be more ruthless and arrogant at times but shs GOOD,KNOWS the job, and she has a political mission (the wheel). Jon is a natural leader, but thats not enough",

I must warn you, if you are trying to stay positive, kindly scroll past this and possibly filter the tag #Debbie Downer</p><hr><p>The show has been progressively worsening in the plot-driven creative decisions for a while now, but hasn\u2019t been so blatantly apparent the general audience until this Season.<br/></p><p>Tying up loose ends becomes harder when your rope is frayed.\u00a0</p><h2>VIEWING GoT THROUGH CULTURAL LENSES: Race, Gender and Disability. <small><b>But trust me it\u2019s ~hIsToRicAlLy aCcuRatE~</b></small></h2><p>Both Episode 3 and 4 have deeply problematic relationships with People of Color, namely Missandei, The Dothraki, and the indifference towards the xenophobia in the North and The Starks. People of color are disposable, and being\u00a0\u201cwary\u201d of them is not only reasonable, but an expectation.<br/></p><p>They also have had some of the most astounding sexism yet, and thats saying a lot for GoT. The story tries to address Daenerys being discredited entirely for her efforts, while simultaneously framing Dany as being irrational for not getting credit, so it becomes contradictory. The more shocking but is the framing of Sansa\u2019s suffering as necessary experience points. <i>That\u2019s just wrong</i>. And those are only the overt instances, but there are also the quiet implication that Arya cannot possibly be a lady or a love interest because she is just too badass (Badass in GoT being interchangeable with violent).</p><p>Also, I\u2019m going to give the ableism an honorable mention because it\u2019s a show-wide thing that continues to follow Bran, Tyrion, and possibly Mad!Targaryen disease. Yikes.</p><p>But these are just <i>social</i> commentaries on Game of Thrones. If you are D&amp;D (<strike>white, straight men</strike>), and you don\u2019t care about that, you should still be able to identify the <b><i>structural</i></b> problems in the writing:</p><p><b> - - Full social, literary, and cinematic commentary under the cut - - </b><br/></p><!-- more --><h2>THE LONG\u00a0<small>(<strike>short</strike>)</small> NIGHT:\u00a0 gotcha! Thrones have more relevance than the threat of human inhalation hehehe</h2><p>Everyone who has followed my blog knows that I not only believed, but also rooted for Daenerys to be the one to end the Long Night. In fact, I thought they would take the book route of having her die for the living. <a href=\"https://asoiafuniversity.tumblr.com/post/178326772704/you-seem-to-have-become-more-sure-of-jon-and\">On a magical level, it makes no sense for Dany to have dragons and Jon to return to life so they can further a political plot.</a> They had a part to play on the Long Night, and they should have at least helped cause a chain of events that lead on to the (show only) Night King\u2019s death. That said, I was actually very proud of Arya being the one to do the deed, and if it wasn\u2019t Dany, I was thrilled it was her, because it uses her training for something better than revenge, but protection. Unfortunately, it was all very choppy. The Night King was too invincible for a satisfying death: There was no drop of Thanos\u2019 blood, no wounded Sauron, only a cocky smile after Dany failed to burn him. Dany, Jon, and even Theon should have prepped the Night King for death, because it\u2019s all about putting out differences aside for good. <b>Not to mention there was no emotional stakes against the Night King.</b> <b>No personal sacrifice or outstanding humane bravery was necessary, only physical skill</b>. There is <i>nothing</i> unrealistic about Arya being the hero, but it diminishes her heroic standpoint when the Night King is just another regular guy that can die from a stab. And in ONE episode!! Sure, the weapon was important, but if all was needed to kill the NK was Valyrian steel, then heck, Bronn might as well show up with a Valyrian scorpion, why not? <b>The Long Night was not a battle of Humanity uniting against evil, but force 1 versus force 2.</b> YES, there were consequences like Theon, Jorah, Lyanna, and Edd, but it wasn\u2019t different than any other battle of strength. The magical, thematic, and emotional stakes of the Long Night were completely disregarded. <b>It specially becomes apparent when the final villains are human, because it disregards that the entire point of the Long Night is humanity against the humane.\u00a0</b></p><h2>AEGON VS. DAENERYS: <a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/184715592666/what-are-the-issues-with-how-sansas-being-written\">Surprise! it\u2019s a Sansa Plot!</a>\u00a0lolz gotcha again</h2><p>EVEN in a scenario where betraying Daenerys and crowning Jon was the morally correct thing to do for Sansa and Varys (Tyrion?), it was not framed that way (<strike>as far as they know)</strike>. Yes, Daenerys has been undeniably snappy, stubborn, and frustrating this season. But she has not given Sansa or Arya an INKLING of tangible proof to disregard her as a Queen. All the people she\u2019s fought so far have been slavers, rapists, and soldiers, the latter one being Lannisters soldiers, the very ones Sansa had been imploring Jon to address. If Daenerys marches her armies North, she\u2019s starving them, but if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019s a selfish bitch who doesn\u2019t care about the North\u2019s welfare. It makes Sansa seem unreasonable, and, well, petty. Why hate Dany? just cuz!\u00a0<b>They should have written Sansa to say something along the lines of\u00a0</b><i><b>\u201cDaenerys hasn\u2019t given me a personal reason to distrust her yet, but what about the Southern kings that come after her? will they keep the North safe? How will I know the North will stay out of Southern affairs generations after Daenerys? For these reasons a, b and c, I think the North should be independent.\u201d</b> </i>etc etc etc. Arya could have said this too. Instead we got\u00a0<b>\u201cWe said we wouldn\u2019t bow to anyone!\u201d </b>and\u00a0<b>\u201cShe\u2019s not one of us\u201d</b>, which makes them both sound power hungry and xenophobic. Consier the fact that Sansa broke Jon\u2019s trust for personal gain. Sansa does not seek to support her brother, but rather push him to do something he\u2019ll probably resent her for. Show!Sansa doesn\u2019t care about Jon or Jon\u2019s wants. Consider that she doesn\u2019t even trust Jon\u2019s judgement, so it makes us think the only reason she wants him as King is so she can remain the most powerful person in the North. <i>This is a Littlefinger move. This is a Cersei move. </i>This is a huge disservice to the Starks.\u00a0<a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/184697583806/okay-one-more-thing-i-just-dont-understand\">It also makes Varys seem like he only wants a ruler whom he can control</a>.</p><h2>CHARACTER CONSTANCY: New phone who dis??</h2><h2>Book Sansa Stark:</h2><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHelp [Lancel],\u201d Sansa commanded two of the serving men. One just looked at her and ran, flagon and all\u2026 .Together, Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet. \u201cTake him to Maester Frenken.\u201d <b>Lancel was one of them, yet somehow she still could not bring herself to wish him dead. I am soft and weak and stupid, just as Joffrey says. I should be killing him, not helping him.</b></i><br/></p><p><i><b>Sansa could not believe she had spoken. Was she mad?</b> To tell [Joffrey] no in front of half the court? She hadn\u2019t meant to say anything, only \u2026 Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless, but he meant no harm.</i><br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>A good heart. I have a good heart.</b> Hysterical laughter rose up her gullet, but Sansa choked it back down. The bells were ringing, slow and mournful. Ringing, ringing, ringing. They had rung for King Robert the same way. <b>Joffrey was dead, he was dead, he was dead, dead, dead. Why was she crying</b>, when she wanted to dance? Were they tears of joy?</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>What was it that Septa Mordane used to tell her? <b>A lady\u2019s armor is courtesy, that was it. She donned her armor</b></i></p></blockquote><p>Yet \u2026 despite her constant and consistent book compassion, the only thing the show seems constant is that Sansa has learned compassion is naive, courtesy is stupid, suffering is a necessity to thrive, and manipulation is the only way you can survive.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2>Book Arya Stark:</h2><blockquote><p><i>Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. <b>Arya would make friends with anybody.</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Arya\u2019s place was Winterfell</b>, only Winterfell was gone. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, <b>the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.</b><br/></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>She would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, <b>but she could not leave them. They were her pack,</b> her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens.\u00a0</i><br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>[Arya] had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores.</b> They [\u2026] told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya was friends to anyone and everyone. She is open minded, curious and well traveled. She was not willing to leave\u00a0\u201cher pack\u201d when they were only orphans she knew for a few months <small>(Gendry being one of them) </small>let alone her family. Her place was Winterfell. So why would Arya refer to Daenerys as an outsider? Why would Arya go out of her way to avoid social events and talking to people? Why would Arya leave her loved ones and her home without so much as a goodbye? Because the plot needs her to.</p><h2>Book Samwell Tarly <small><b>(oh yes him too!)\u00a0</b></small></h2><blockquote><p><i>Sam\u2019s head bobbed up and down with every step that Small Paul took. \u201cStop it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cput me down, I\u2019m not a baby. I\u2019m a man of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d He sobbed. \u201c<b>Just let me die</b>.\u201d</i></p><p>It amazes me that the very same show that made Sam progress from being unable to walk any longer for his life, to being able to protect Gilly and stand up for himself, revert back into the young boy who fell down crying in battle. Sam! who wanted to live his life being a hero rather than reading of them. Grenn, Pyp, and Edd put their lives on the line to help Sam grow and overcome this, and he did! But suddenly he forgot how to fight for his life, and Edd had to die as a consequence. Not only that, but Sam did not wake up after Edd\u2019s death, but rather continued to sob helplessly and swatting away wights. Did this have a consequence? NAH! Plot armor needs him for \u2026 to protect Gilly again, even though he can\u2019t protect himself.\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Book Jon Snow:\u00a0</h2><blockquote><p><i>Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in his cell. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you did,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know you did it.\u201d He looked away shyly. \u201c<b>I\u2019ve never had a friend before.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re not friends,\u201d Jon said. He put a hand on Sam\u2019s broad shoulder. <b>\u201cWe\u2019re brothers.\u201d</b></i><br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees.<b> Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Ghost was with him, he knew that much. The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort.\u00a0</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Jon wondered where Ghost was now. </b>Had he gone to Castle Black, or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods? He had no sense of the direwolf, not even in his dreams.<b> It made him feel as if part of himself had been cut off.</b> Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him, <b>he felt alone</b>. He did not want to die alone.</i></p></blockquote><p>Book Jon has always been very different than show Jon. Book Jon has a lot of unresolved self-hatred, but he is also more arrogant, with ambition and hunger to prove himself. Show Jon is an embodiment of\u00a0\u201cAmbition is bad and only those who abhor power are worthy\u201d, which strays far from truth. But the direction of this season also makes him disregard Sam\u2019s life, which I can understand for the need of killing the Night King, but come on at least show a bit of remorse on Sam here. But Ghost?? There is nothing in show or book canon, EVEN PLOT-DRIVEN REASONING, to neglect Ghost.

Thrones have more relevance than the threat of human inhalation hehehe</h2><p>Everyone who has followed my blog knows that I not only believed, but also rooted for Daenerys to be the one to end the Long Night. In fact, I thought they would take the book route of having her die for the living. <a href=\"https://asoiafuniversity.tumblr.com/post/178326772704/you-seem-to-have-become-more-sure-of-jon-and\">On a magical level, it makes no sense for Dany to have dragons and Jon to return to life so they can further a political plot.</a> They had a part to play on the Long Night, and they should have at least helped cause a chain of events that lead on to the (show only) Night King\u2019s death. That said, I was actually very proud of Arya being the one to do the deed, and if it wasn\u2019t Dany, I was thrilled it was her, because it uses her training for something better than revenge, but protection. Unfortunately, it was all very choppy. The Night King was too invincible for a satisfying death: There was no drop of Thanos\u2019 blood, no wounded Sauron, only a cocky smile after Dany failed to burn him. Dany, Jon, and even Theon should have prepped the Night King for death, because it\u2019s all about putting out differences aside for good. <b>Not to mention there was no emotional stakes against the Night King.</b> <b>No personal sacrifice or outstanding humane bravery was necessary, only physical skill</b>. There is <i>nothing</i> unrealistic about Arya being the hero, but it diminishes her heroic standpoint when the Night King is just another regular guy that can die from a stab. And in ONE episode!! Sure, the weapon was important, but if all was needed to kill the NK was Valyrian steel, then heck, Bronn might as well show up with a Valyrian scorpion, why not? <b>The Long Night was not a battle of Humanity uniting against evil, but force 1 versus force 2.</b> YES, there were consequences like Theon, Jorah, Lyanna, and Edd, but it wasn\u2019t different than any other battle of strength. The magical, thematic, and emotional stakes of the Long Night were completely disregarded. <b>It specially becomes apparent when the final villains are human, because it disregards that the entire point of the Long Night is humanity against the humane.\u00a0</b></p><h2>AEGON VS. DAENERYS: <a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/184715592666/what-are-the-issues-with-how-sansas-being-written\">Surprise! it\u2019s a Sansa Plot!</a>\u00a0lolz gotcha again</h2><p>EVEN in a scenario where betraying Daenerys and crowning Jon was the morally correct thing to do for Sansa and Varys (Tyrion?), it was not framed that way (<strike>as far as they know)</strike>. Yes, Daenerys has been undeniably snappy, stubborn, and frustrating this season. But she has not given Sansa or Arya an INKLING of tangible proof to disregard her as a Queen. All the people she\u2019s fought so far have been slavers, rapists, and soldiers, the latter one being Lannisters soldiers, the very ones Sansa had been imploring Jon to address. If Daenerys marches her armies North, she\u2019s starving them, but if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019s a selfish bitch who doesn\u2019t care about the North\u2019s welfare. It makes Sansa seem unreasonable, and, well, petty. Why hate Dany? just cuz!\u00a0<b>They should have written Sansa to say something along the lines of\u00a0</b><i><b>\u201cDaenerys hasn\u2019t given me a personal reason to distrust her yet, but what about the Southern kings that come after her? will they keep the North safe? How will I know the North will stay out of Southern affairs generations after Daenerys? For these reasons a, b and c, I think the North should be independent.\u201d</b> </i>etc etc etc. Arya could have said this too. Instead we got\u00a0<b>\u201cWe said we wouldn\u2019t bow to anyone!\u201d </b>and\u00a0<b>\u201cShe\u2019s not one of us\u201d</b>, which makes them both sound power hungry and xenophobic. Consier the fact that Sansa broke Jon\u2019s trust for personal gain. Sansa does not seek to support her brother, but rather push him to do something he\u2019ll probably resent her for. Show!Sansa doesn\u2019t care about Jon or Jon\u2019s wants. Consider that she doesn\u2019t even trust Jon\u2019s judgement, so it makes us think the only reason she wants him as King is so she can remain the most powerful person in the North. <i>This is a Littlefinger move. This is a Cersei move. </i>This is a huge disservice to the Starks.\u00a0<a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/184697583806/okay-one-more-thing-i-just-dont-understand\">It also makes Varys seem like he only wants a ruler whom he can control</a>.</p><h2>CHARACTER CONSTANCY: New phone who dis??</h2><h2>Book Sansa Stark:</h2><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHelp [Lancel],\u201d Sansa commanded two of the serving men. One just looked at her and ran, flagon and all\u2026 .Together, Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet. \u201cTake him to Maester Frenken.\u201d <b>Lancel was one of them, yet somehow she still could not bring herself to wish him dead. I am soft and weak and stupid, just as Joffrey says. I should be killing him, not helping him.</b></i><br></p><p><i><b>Sansa could not believe she had spoken. Was she mad?</b> To tell [Joffrey] no in front of half the court? She hadn\u2019t meant to say anything, only \u2026 Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless, but he meant no harm.</i><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>A good heart. I have a good heart.</b> Hysterical laughter rose up her gullet, but Sansa choked it back down. The bells were ringing, slow and mournful. Ringing, ringing, ringing. They had rung for King Robert the same way. <b>Joffrey was dead, he was dead, he was dead, dead, dead. Why was she crying</b>, when she wanted to dance? Were they tears of joy?</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>What was it that Septa Mordane used to tell her? <b>A lady\u2019s armor is courtesy, that was it. She donned her armor</b></i></p></blockquote><p>Yet \u2026 despite her constant and consistent book compassion, the only thing the show seems constant is that Sansa has learned compassion is naive, courtesy is stupid, suffering is a necessity to thrive, and manipulation is the only way you can survive.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2>Book Arya Stark:</h2><blockquote><p><i>Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. <b>Arya would make friends with anybody.</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Arya\u2019s place was Winterfell</b>, only Winterfell was gone. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, <b>the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.</b><br></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>She would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, <b>but she could not leave them. They were her pack,</b> her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens.\u00a0</i><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>[Arya] had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores.</b> They [\u2026] told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya was friends to anyone and everyone. She is open minded, curious and well traveled. She was not willing to leave\u00a0\u201cher pack\u201d when they were only orphans she knew for a few months <small>(Gendry being one of them) </small>let alone her family. Her place was Winterfell. So why would Arya refer to Daenerys as an outsider? Why would Arya go out of her way to avoid social events and talking to people? Why would Arya leave her loved ones and her home without so much as a goodbye? Because the plot needs her to.</p><h2>Book Samwell Tarly <small><b>(oh yes him too!)\u00a0</b></small></h2><blockquote><p><i>Sam\u2019s head bobbed up and down with every step that Small Paul took. \u201cStop it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cput me down, I\u2019m not a baby. I\u2019m a man of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d He sobbed. \u201c<b>Just let me die</b>.\u201d</i></p><p>It amazes me that the very same show that made Sam progress from being unable to walk any longer for his life, to being able to protect Gilly and stand up for himself, revert back into the young boy who fell down crying in battle. Sam! who wanted to live his life being a hero rather than reading of them. Grenn, Pyp, and Edd put their lives on the line to help Sam grow and overcome this, and he did! But suddenly he forgot how to fight for his life, and Edd had to die as a consequence. Not only that, but Sam did not wake up after Edd\u2019s death, but rather continued to sob helplessly and swatting away wights. Did this have a consequence? NAH! Plot armor needs him for \u2026 to protect Gilly again, even though he can\u2019t protect himself.\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Book Jon Snow:\u00a0</h2><blockquote><p><i>Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in his cell. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you did,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know you did it.\u201d He looked away shyly. \u201c<b>I\u2019ve never had a friend before.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re not friends,\u201d Jon said. He put a hand on Sam\u2019s broad shoulder. <b>\u201cWe\u2019re brothers.\u201d</b></i><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees.<b> Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Ghost was with him, he knew that much. The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort.\u00a0</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Jon wondered where Ghost was now. </b>Had he gone to Castle Black, or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods? He had no sense of the direwolf, not even in his dreams.<b> It made him feel as if part of himself had been cut off.</b> Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him, <b>he felt alone</b>. He did not want to die alone.</i></p></blockquote><p>Book Jon has always been very different than show Jon. Book Jon has a lot of unresolved self-hatred, but he is also more arrogant, with ambition and hunger to prove himself. Show Jon is an embodiment of\u00a0\u201cAmbition is bad and only those who abhor power are worthy\u201d, which strays far from truth. But the direction of this season also makes him disregard Sam\u2019s life, which I can understand for the need of killing the Night King, but come on at least show a bit of remorse on Sam here. But Ghost?? There is nothing in show or book canon, EVEN PLOT-DRIVEN REASONING, to neglect Ghost. Couldn\u2019t you just have a single shot of Ghost and Jon in the end, and pretend he was with Jon all along like the cheap ass s5-s6 did? What about his place with the Starks? What does Jon want exactly? to marry Daenerys? to stay home with his sisters? does he really want to be North with Tormund more than anything? if not, why say it? And are we really disregarding 7 Seasons and 5 books of bastard inner struggle for him not to come to terms with his heritage? <b>Really, it seems that the biggest topic this season\u00a0\u201cSHOULD JON BE KING?\u201d involves <i>EVERYONE</i> except Jon himself.</b></p><h2>Book Daenerys Targaryen:\u00a0</h2><blockquote><p><i>\u201cOnly death may pay for life.\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u201cDeath?\u201d Dany wrapped her arms around herself protectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. <b>\u201cMy death?\u201d She told herself she would die for him</b>, <b>if she must.

Thrones have more relevance than the threat of human inhalation hehehe</h2><p>Everyone who has followed my blog knows that I not only believed, but also rooted for Daenerys to be the one to end the Long Night. In fact, I thought they would take the book route of having her die for the living. <a href=\"https://asoiafuniversity.tumblr.com/post/178326772704/you-seem-to-have-become-more-sure-of-jon-and\">On a magical level, it makes no sense for Dany to have dragons and Jon to return to life so they can further a political plot.</a> They had a part to play on the Long Night, and they should have at least helped cause a chain of events that lead on to the (show only) Night King\u2019s death. That said, I was actually very proud of Arya being the one to do the deed, and if it wasn\u2019t Dany, I was thrilled it was her, because it uses her training for something better than revenge, but protection. Unfortunately, it was all very choppy. The Night King was too invincible for a satisfying death: There was no drop of Thanos\u2019 blood, no wounded Sauron, only a cocky smile after Dany failed to burn him. Dany, Jon, and even Theon should have prepped the Night King for death, because it\u2019s all about putting out differences aside for good. <b>Not to mention there was no emotional stakes against the Night King.</b> <b>No personal sacrifice or outstanding humane bravery was necessary, only physical skill</b>. There is <i>nothing</i> unrealistic about Arya being the hero, but it diminishes her heroic standpoint when the Night King is just another regular guy that can die from a stab. And in ONE episode!! Sure, the weapon was important, but if all was needed to kill the NK was Valyrian steel, then heck, Bronn might as well show up with a Valyrian scorpion, why not? <b>The Long Night was not a battle of Humanity uniting against evil, but force 1 versus force 2.</b> YES, there were consequences like Theon, Jorah, Lyanna, and Edd, but it wasn\u2019t different than any other battle of strength. The magical, thematic, and emotional stakes of the Long Night were completely disregarded. <b>It specially becomes apparent when the final villains are human, because it disregards that the entire point of the Long Night is humanity against the humane.\u00a0</b></p><h2>AEGON VS. DAENERYS: <a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/184715592666/what-are-the-issues-with-how-sansas-being-written\">Surprise! it\u2019s a Sansa Plot!</a>\u00a0lolz gotcha again</h2><p>EVEN in a scenario where betraying Daenerys and crowning Jon was the morally correct thing to do for Sansa and Varys (Tyrion?), it was not framed that way (<strike>as far as they know)</strike>. Yes, Daenerys has been undeniably snappy, stubborn, and frustrating this season. But she has not given Sansa or Arya an INKLING of tangible proof to disregard her as a Queen. All the people she\u2019s fought so far have been slavers, rapists, and soldiers, the latter one being Lannisters soldiers, the very ones Sansa had been imploring Jon to address. If Daenerys marches her armies North, she\u2019s starving them, but if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019s a selfish bitch who doesn\u2019t care about the North\u2019s welfare. It makes Sansa seem unreasonable, and, well, petty. Why hate Dany? just cuz!\u00a0<b>They should have written Sansa to say something along the lines of\u00a0</b><i><b>\u201cDaenerys hasn\u2019t given me a personal reason to distrust her yet, but what about the Southern kings that come after her? will they keep the North safe? How will I know the North will stay out of Southern affairs generations after Daenerys? For these reasons a, b and c, I think the North should be independent.\u201d</b> </i>etc etc etc. Arya could have said this too. Instead we got\u00a0<b>\u201cWe said we wouldn\u2019t bow to anyone!\u201d </b>and\u00a0<b>\u201cShe\u2019s not one of us\u201d</b>, which makes them both sound power hungry and xenophobic. Consier the fact that Sansa broke Jon\u2019s trust for personal gain. Sansa does not seek to support her brother, but rather push him to do something he\u2019ll probably resent her for. Show!Sansa doesn\u2019t care about Jon or Jon\u2019s wants. Consider that she doesn\u2019t even trust Jon\u2019s judgement, so it makes us think the only reason she wants him as King is so she can remain the most powerful person in the North. <i>This is a Littlefinger move. This is a Cersei move. </i>This is a huge disservice to the Starks.\u00a0<a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/184697583806/okay-one-more-thing-i-just-dont-understand\">It also makes Varys seem like he only wants a ruler whom he can control</a>.</p><h2>CHARACTER CONSTANCY: New phone who dis??</h2><h2>Book Sansa Stark:</h2><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHelp [Lancel],\u201d Sansa commanded two of the serving men. One just looked at her and ran, flagon and all\u2026 .Together, Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet. \u201cTake him to Maester Frenken.\u201d <b>Lancel was one of them, yet somehow she still could not bring herself to wish him dead. I am soft and weak and stupid, just as Joffrey says. I should be killing him, not helping him.</b></i><br></p><p><i><b>Sansa could not believe she had spoken. Was she mad?</b> To tell [Joffrey] no in front of half the court? She hadn\u2019t meant to say anything, only \u2026 Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless, but he meant no harm.</i><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>A good heart. I have a good heart.</b> Hysterical laughter rose up her gullet, but Sansa choked it back down. The bells were ringing, slow and mournful. Ringing, ringing, ringing. They had rung for King Robert the same way. <b>Joffrey was dead, he was dead, he was dead, dead, dead. Why was she crying</b>, when she wanted to dance? Were they tears of joy?</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>What was it that Septa Mordane used to tell her? <b>A lady\u2019s armor is courtesy, that was it. She donned her armor</b></i></p></blockquote><p>Yet \u2026 despite her constant and consistent book compassion, the only thing the show seems constant is that Sansa has learned compassion is naive, courtesy is stupid, suffering is a necessity to thrive, and manipulation is the only way you can survive.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2>Book Arya Stark:</h2><blockquote><p><i>Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. <b>Arya would make friends with anybody.</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Arya\u2019s place was Winterfell</b>, only Winterfell was gone. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, <b>the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.</b><br></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>She would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, <b>but she could not leave them. They were her pack,</b> her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens.\u00a0</i><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>[Arya] had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores.</b> They [\u2026] told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya was friends to anyone and everyone. She is open minded, curious and well traveled. She was not willing to leave\u00a0\u201cher pack\u201d when they were only orphans she knew for a few months <small>(Gendry being one of them) </small>let alone her family. Her place was Winterfell. So why would Arya refer to Daenerys as an outsider? Why would Arya go out of her way to avoid social events and talking to people? Why would Arya leave her loved ones and her home without so much as a goodbye? Because the plot needs her to.</p><h2>Book Samwell Tarly <small><b>(oh yes him too!)\u00a0</b></small></h2><blockquote><p><i>Sam\u2019s head bobbed up and down with every step that Small Paul took. \u201cStop it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cput me down, I\u2019m not a baby. I\u2019m a man of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d He sobbed. \u201c<b>Just let me die</b>.\u201d</i></p><p>It amazes me that the very same show that made Sam progress from being unable to walk any longer for his life, to being able to protect Gilly and stand up for himself, revert back into the young boy who fell down crying in battle. Sam! who wanted to live his life being a hero rather than reading of them. Grenn, Pyp, and Edd put their lives on the line to help Sam grow and overcome this, and he did! But suddenly he forgot how to fight for his life, and Edd had to die as a consequence. Not only that, but Sam did not wake up after Edd\u2019s death, but rather continued to sob helplessly and swatting away wights. Did this have a consequence? NAH! Plot armor needs him for \u2026 to protect Gilly again, even though he can\u2019t protect himself.\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Book Jon Snow:\u00a0</h2><blockquote><p><i>Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in his cell. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you did,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know you did it.\u201d He looked away shyly. \u201c<b>I\u2019ve never had a friend before.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re not friends,\u201d Jon said. He put a hand on Sam\u2019s broad shoulder. <b>\u201cWe\u2019re brothers.\u201d</b></i><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees.<b> Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Ghost was with him, he knew that much. The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort.\u00a0</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Jon wondered where Ghost was now. </b>Had he gone to Castle Black, or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods? He had no sense of the direwolf, not even in his dreams.<b> It made him feel as if part of himself had been cut off.</b> Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him, <b>he felt alone</b>. He did not want to die alone.</i></p></blockquote><p>Book Jon has always been very different than show Jon. Book Jon has a lot of unresolved self-hatred, but he is also more arrogant, with ambition and hunger to prove himself. Show Jon is an embodiment of\u00a0\u201cAmbition is bad and only those who abhor power are worthy\u201d, which strays far from truth. But the direction of this season also makes him disregard Sam\u2019s life, which I can understand for the need of killing the Night King, but come on at least show a bit of remorse on Sam here. But Ghost?? There is nothing in show or book canon, EVEN PLOT-DRIVEN REASONING, to neglect Ghost. Couldn\u2019t you just have a single shot of Ghost and Jon in the end, and pretend he was with Jon all along like the cheap ass s5-s6 did? What about his place with the Starks? What does Jon want exactly? to marry Daenerys? to stay home with his sisters? does he really want to be North with Tormund more than anything? if not, why say it? And are we really disregarding 7 Seasons and 5 books of bastard inner struggle for him not to come to terms with his heritage? <b>Really, it seems that the biggest topic this season\u00a0\u201cSHOULD JON BE KING?\u201d involves <i>EVERYONE</i> except Jon himself.</b></p><h2>Book Daenerys Targaryen:\u00a0</h2><blockquote><p><i>\u201cOnly death may pay for life.\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u201cDeath?\u201d Dany wrapped her arms around herself protectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. <b>\u201cMy death?\u201d She told herself she would die for him</b>, <b>if she must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would not be afraid.</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Why do the gods make kings and queens, if not to protect the ones who can\u2019t protect themselves?\u201c</b></i></p></blockquote><p>This one is very complex, with controversies left and right, but I\u2019m about to make points that not even the most ardent Dany haters could not refute. Bear with me.</p><p>I \u2026 <i><b>love</b></i> Daenerys. More than any other character. Ever.\u00a0</p><p>That said, I acknowledge she will go through a dark inner struggle in the books and that she is more morally ambiguous than your average protagonist. As a minority, I understand she has white savior tropes in her story\u00a0<small>(though severely more pronounced in the show than books). </small><a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/182365011386/1-i-recently-saw-your-posts-that-the-lannisters\">I reject the notion that Daenerys, or anyone, should sit the Iron throne</a>. <a href=\"https://joannalannister.tumblr.com/post/179320618161/for-me-daenerys-targaryen-represents\">And I admit that I believe Dany will die sacrificing herself in the books</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Not to mention, leaving the big villains of the series to be Cersei and Dany is very redundant after we faced the end of the world with the Night King. <b>Humanity needs to unite or die\u2026..until they don\u2019t.</b> Remember, this is the Game of Thrones, so all we do here is #ForTheThrone.\u00a0</p><p><b>But let\u2019s <i>assume</i> the Mad Queen theories were right (<a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/178481138121/flowisaconstruct-oadara-stonerwitchxo\">and not sexist</a>) all along. </b>Let\u2019s assume that there is nothing problematic about introducing an army of people of color led by a mad woman who rape and raid and cause unnecessary destruction <small>(that she so vocally avoided through every city take over yet).</small> Let\u2019s assume that disposing of the Dothraki, Unsullied, and closest black friend was very necessary to emphasize how unstable Daenerys is. Let\u2019s assume that Daenerys\u2019 only motivation to free slaves, rescue Jon, and save the North was entirely for personal gain. <b>Where is the dramatic build up?</b></p><p>So now we have a scenario in which Daenerys has done good deeds, but only because she has evil, selfish motives. Very plausible for many of you already.</p><p>And yet \u2026 what has Dany done to be considered evil, at this point (8.04) of the story? Once again I ask, what tangible proof does the story provide that Daenerys Targaryen will go at any lengths to gain power?\u00a0</p><p>The people she\u2019s fought? Slavers, rapists, and soldiers who attacked her first.</p><p>The people she wants to fight? Cersei Lannister, the same person Sansa and Tyrion have been going on and on and <i>on</i> about wanting to dethrone.\u00a0</p><p>The fact that she keeps reprimanding her advisors for giving her bad advice, even though \u2026 all their advice has failed?</p><p>The fact that she resents being discredited and distrusted for all her efforts, even though she has been?</p><p><b>The only thing that hints to Mad Dany is her heritage, something that she has no control over. </b>And even here, shouldn\u2019t we sympathize with that? I<b>s the show saying Dany is not responsible of her actions because of her inherent madness, or will they hold her accountable for ignoring her mental state (???)</b></p><p>If I was a show writer, and I wanted to wrap up a coherent Mad!Dany Plot, ASSUMING it\u2019s not problematic in all levels and ASSUMING it\u2019s what was meant to happen all along, I would have needed to introduce actions that make her sanity questionable long ago (not just morally ambiguous choices, actual insane choices), and build up that tension over and over and over, maybe out of the earshot of other characters, until the tension snaps and she does something unforgivable.\u00a0</p><p>The vocal criticism over so many fans and so many media outlets over Dany\u2019s arc in the show is not because we were all, the millions and millions of us, too stupid to see it coming, but because there was an absolute lack of buildup for it.</p><p><b>If they wanted any sweetness in bittersweet, they could have at the very least framed Sansa\u2019s betrayal of Jon\u2019s trust as a necessary moral act.</b>\u00a0At least a small portion of Sansa fans would have said<i> \u201coh she had to do to the hard thing because it was the right thing.\u201d</i>\u00a0But as I said above, it\u2019s not that way. Jaime attacked Ned and fought Robb but Sansa trusts Brienne\u2019s word; why can\u2019t she trust Jon\u2019s? Is she threatened by the lack of power, or can she justify her anger?<b> This makes the audience dislike both Dany and Sansa, feel indifference to Arya, and leave out Jon from his very own plotline.\u00a0</b></p><p>It\u2019s just as Tyrion said\u00a0\"You seem determined to dislike [Dany]\u201d.

Thrones have more relevance than the threat of human inhalation hehehe</h2><p>Everyone who has followed my blog knows that I not only believed, but also rooted for Daenerys to be the one to end the Long Night. In fact, I thought they would take the book route of having her die for the living. <a href=\"https://asoiafuniversity.tumblr.com/post/178326772704/you-seem-to-have-become-more-sure-of-jon-and\">On a magical level, it makes no sense for Dany to have dragons and Jon to return to life so they can further a political plot.</a> They had a part to play on the Long Night, and they should have at least helped cause a chain of events that lead on to the (show only) Night King&rsquo;s death. That said, I was actually very proud of Arya being the one to do the deed, and if it wasn&rsquo;t Dany, I was thrilled it was her, because it uses her training for something better than revenge, but protection. Unfortunately, it was all very choppy. The Night King was too invincible for a satisfying death: There was no drop of Thanos&rsquo; blood, no wounded Sauron, only a cocky smile after Dany failed to burn him. Dany, Jon, and even Theon should have prepped the Night King for death, because it&rsquo;s all about putting out differences aside for good. <b>Not to mention there was no emotional stakes against the Night King.</b> <b>No personal sacrifice or outstanding humane bravery was necessary, only physical skill</b>. There is <i>nothing</i> unrealistic about Arya being the hero, but it diminishes her heroic standpoint when the Night King is just another regular guy that can die from a stab. And in ONE episode!! Sure, the weapon was important, but if all was needed to kill the NK was Valyrian steel, then heck, Bronn might as well show up with a Valyrian scorpion, why not? <b>The Long Night was not a battle of Humanity uniting against evil, but force 1 versus force 2.</b> YES, there were consequences like Theon, Jorah, Lyanna, and Edd, but it wasn&rsquo;t different than any other battle of strength. The magical, thematic, and emotional stakes of the Long Night were completely disregarded. <b>It specially becomes apparent when the final villains are human, because it disregards that the entire point of the Long Night is humanity against the humane.&nbsp;</b></p><h2>AEGON VS. DAENERYS: <a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/184715592666/what-are-the-issues-with-how-sansas-being-written\">Surprise! it&rsquo;s a Sansa Plot!</a>&nbsp;lolz gotcha again</h2><p>EVEN in a scenario where betraying Daenerys and crowning Jon was the morally correct thing to do for Sansa and Varys (Tyrion?), it was not framed that way (<strike>as far as they know)</strike>. Yes, Daenerys has been undeniably snappy, stubborn, and frustrating this season. But she has not given Sansa or Arya an INKLING of tangible proof to disregard her as a Queen. All the people she&rsquo;s fought so far have been slavers, rapists, and soldiers, the latter one being Lannisters soldiers, the very ones Sansa had been imploring Jon to address. If Daenerys marches her armies North, she&rsquo;s starving them, but if she doesn&rsquo;t she&rsquo;s a selfish bitch who doesn&rsquo;t care about the North&rsquo;s welfare. It makes Sansa seem unreasonable, and, well, petty. Why hate Dany? just cuz!&nbsp;<b>They should have written Sansa to say something along the lines of&nbsp;</b><i><b>&ldquo;Daenerys hasn&rsquo;t given me a personal reason to distrust her yet, but what about the Southern kings that come after her? will they keep the North safe? How will I know the North will stay out of Southern affairs generations after Daenerys? For these reasons a, b and c, I think the North should be independent.&rdquo;</b> </i>etc etc etc. Arya could have said this too. Instead we got&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;We said we wouldn&rsquo;t bow to anyone!&rdquo; </b>and&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not one of us&rdquo;</b>, which makes them both sound power hungry and xenophobic. Consier the fact that Sansa broke Jon&rsquo;s trust for personal gain. Sansa does not seek to support her brother, but rather push him to do something he&rsquo;ll probably resent her for. Show!Sansa doesn&rsquo;t care about Jon or Jon&rsquo;s wants. Consider that she doesn&rsquo;t even trust Jon&rsquo;s judgement, so it makes us think the only reason she wants him as King is so she can remain the most powerful person in the North. <i>This is a Littlefinger move. This is a Cersei move. </i>This is a huge disservice to the Starks.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/184697583806/okay-one-more-thing-i-just-dont-understand\">It also makes Varys seem like he only wants a ruler whom he can control</a>.</p><h2>CHARACTER CONSTANCY: New phone who dis??</h2><h2>Book Sansa Stark:</h2><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Help [Lancel],&rdquo; Sansa commanded two of the serving men. One just looked at her and ran, flagon and all&hellip; .Together, Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet. &ldquo;Take him to Maester Frenken.&rdquo; <b>Lancel was one of them, yet somehow she still could not bring herself to wish him dead. I am soft and weak and stupid, just as Joffrey says. I should be killing him, not helping him.</b></i><br /></p><p><i><b>Sansa could not believe she had spoken. Was she mad?</b> To tell [Joffrey] no in front of half the court? She hadn&rsquo;t meant to say anything, only &hellip; Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless, but he meant no harm.</i><br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>A good heart. I have a good heart.</b> Hysterical laughter rose up her gullet, but Sansa choked it back down. The bells were ringing, slow and mournful. Ringing, ringing, ringing. They had rung for King Robert the same way. <b>Joffrey was dead, he was dead, he was dead, dead, dead. Why was she crying</b>, when she wanted to dance? Were they tears of joy?</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>What was it that Septa Mordane used to tell her? <b>A lady&rsquo;s armor is courtesy, that was it. She donned her armor</b></i></p></blockquote><p>Yet &hellip; despite her constant and consistent book compassion, the only thing the show seems constant is that Sansa has learned compassion is naive, courtesy is stupid, suffering is a necessity to thrive, and manipulation is the only way you can survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Book Arya Stark:</h2><blockquote><p><i>Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. <b>Arya would make friends with anybody.</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Arya&rsquo;s place was Winterfell</b>, only Winterfell was gone. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, <b>the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.</b><br /></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>She would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, <b>but she could not leave them. They were her pack,</b> her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens.&nbsp;</i><br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>[Arya] had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores.</b> They [&hellip;] told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya was friends to anyone and everyone. She is open minded, curious and well traveled. She was not willing to leave&nbsp;&ldquo;her pack&rdquo; when they were only orphans she knew for a few months <small>(Gendry being one of them) </small>let alone her family. Her place was Winterfell. So why would Arya refer to Daenerys as an outsider? Why would Arya go out of her way to avoid social events and talking to people? Why would Arya leave her loved ones and her home without so much as a goodbye? Because the plot needs her to.</p><h2>Book Samwell Tarly <small><b>(oh yes him too!)&nbsp;</b></small></h2><blockquote><p><i>Sam&rsquo;s head bobbed up and down with every step that Small Paul took. &ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;put me down, I&rsquo;m not a baby. I&rsquo;m a man of the Night&rsquo;s Watch.&rdquo; He sobbed. &ldquo;<b>Just let me die</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p>It amazes me that the very same show that made Sam progress from being unable to walk any longer for his life, to being able to protect Gilly and stand up for himself, revert back into the young boy who fell down crying in battle. Sam! who wanted to live his life being a hero rather than reading of them. Grenn, Pyp, and Edd put their lives on the line to help Sam grow and overcome this, and he did! But suddenly he forgot how to fight for his life, and Edd had to die as a consequence. Not only that, but Sam did not wake up after Edd&rsquo;s death, but rather continued to sob helplessly and swatting away wights. Did this have a consequence? NAH! Plot armor needs him for &hellip; to protect Gilly again, even though he can&rsquo;t protect himself.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>Book Jon Snow:&nbsp;</h2><blockquote><p><i>Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in his cell. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you did,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I know you did it.&rdquo; He looked away shyly. &ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;ve never had a friend before.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not friends,&rdquo; Jon said. He put a hand on Sam&rsquo;s broad shoulder. <b>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re brothers.&rdquo;</b></i><br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees.<b> Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Ghost was with him, he knew that much. The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort.&nbsp;</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Jon wondered where Ghost was now. </b>Had he gone to Castle Black, or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods? He had no sense of the direwolf, not even in his dreams.<b> It made him feel as if part of himself had been cut off.</b> Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him, <b>he felt alone</b>. He did not want to die alone.</i></p></blockquote><p>Book Jon has always been very different than show Jon. Book Jon has a lot of unresolved self-hatred, but he is also more arrogant, with ambition and hunger to prove himself. Show Jon is an embodiment of&nbsp;&ldquo;Ambition is bad and only those who abhor power are worthy&rdquo;, which strays far from truth. But the direction of this season also makes him disregard Sam&rsquo;s life, which I can understand for the need of killing the Night King, but come on at least show a bit of remorse on Sam here. But Ghost?? There is nothing in show or book canon, EVEN PLOT-DRIVEN REASONING, to neglect Ghost. Couldn&rsquo;t you just have a single shot of Ghost and Jon in the end, and pretend he was with Jon all along like the cheap ass s5-s6 did? What about his place with the Starks? What does Jon want exactly? to marry Daenerys? to stay home with his sisters? does he really want to be North with Tormund more than anything? if not, why say it? And are we really disregarding 7 Seasons and 5 books of bastard inner struggle for him not to come to terms with his heritage? <b>Really, it seems that the biggest topic this season&nbsp;&ldquo;SHOULD JON BE KING?&rdquo; involves <i>EVERYONE</i> except Jon himself.</b></p><h2>Book Daenerys Targaryen:&nbsp;</h2><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Only death may pay for life.&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Death?&rdquo; Dany wrapped her arms around herself protectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. <b>&ldquo;My death?&rdquo; She told herself she would die for him</b>, <b>if she must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would not be afraid.</b></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>Why do the gods make kings and queens, if not to protect the ones who can&rsquo;t protect themselves?&ldquo;</b></i></p></blockquote><p>This one is very complex, with controversies left and right, but I&rsquo;m about to make points that not even the most ardent Dany haters could not refute. Bear with me.</p><p>I &hellip; <i><b>love</b></i> Daenerys. More than any other character. Ever.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I acknowledge she will go through a dark inner struggle in the books and that she is more morally ambiguous than your average protagonist. As a minority, I understand she has white savior tropes in her story&nbsp;<small>(though severely more pronounced in the show than books). </small><a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/182365011386/1-i-recently-saw-your-posts-that-the-lannisters\">I reject the notion that Daenerys, or anyone, should sit the Iron throne</a>. <a href=\"https://joannalannister.tumblr.com/post/179320618161/for-me-daenerys-targaryen-represents\">And I admit that I believe Dany will die sacrificing herself in the books</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to mention, leaving the big villains of the series to be Cersei and Dany is very redundant after we faced the end of the world with the Night King. <b>Humanity needs to unite or die&hellip;..until they don&rsquo;t.</b> Remember, this is the Game of Thrones, so all we do here is #ForTheThrone.&nbsp;</p><p><b>But let&rsquo;s <i>assume</i> the Mad Queen theories were right (<a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/178481138121/flowisaconstruct-oadara-stonerwitchxo\">and not sexist</a>) all along. </b>Let&rsquo;s assume that there is nothing problematic about introducing an army of people of color led by a mad woman who rape and raid and cause unnecessary destruction <small>(that she so vocally avoided through every city take over yet).</small> Let&rsquo;s assume that disposing of the Dothraki, Unsullied, and closest black friend was very necessary to emphasize how unstable Daenerys is. Let&rsquo;s assume that Daenerys&rsquo; only motivation to free slaves, rescue Jon, and save the North was entirely for personal gain. <b>Where is the dramatic build up?</b></p><p>So now we have a scenario in which Daenerys has done good deeds, but only because she has evil, selfish motives. Very plausible for many of you already.</p><p>And yet &hellip; what has Dany done to be considered evil, at this point (8.04) of the story? Once again I ask, what tangible proof does the story provide that Daenerys Targaryen will go at any lengths to gain power?&nbsp;</p><p>The people she&rsquo;s fought? Slavers, rapists, and soldiers who attacked her first.</p><p>The people she wants to fight? Cersei Lannister, the same person Sansa and Tyrion have been going on and on and <i>on</i> about wanting to dethrone.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that she keeps reprimanding her advisors for giving her bad advice, even though &hellip; all their advice has failed?</p><p>The fact that she resents being discredited and distrusted for all her efforts, even though she has been?</p><p><b>The only thing that hints to Mad Dany is her heritage, something that she has no control over. </b>And even here, shouldn&rsquo;t we sympathize with that? I<b>s the show saying Dany is not responsible of her actions because of her inherent madness, or will they hold her accountable for ignoring her mental state (???)</b></p><p>If I was a show writer, and I wanted to wrap up a coherent Mad!Dany Plot, ASSUMING it&rsquo;s not problematic in all levels and ASSUMING it&rsquo;s what was meant to happen all along, I would have needed to introduce actions that make her sanity questionable long ago (not just morally ambiguous choices, actual insane choices), and build up that tension over and over and over, maybe out of the earshot of other characters, until the tension snaps and she does something unforgivable.&nbsp;</p><p>The vocal criticism over so many fans and so many media outlets over Dany&rsquo;s arc in the show is not because we were all, the millions and millions of us, too stupid to see it coming, but because there was an absolute lack of buildup for it.</p><p><b>If they wanted any sweetness in bittersweet, they could have at the very least framed Sansa&rsquo;s betrayal of Jon&rsquo;s trust as a necessary moral act.</b>&nbsp;At least a small portion of Sansa fans would have said<i> &ldquo;oh she had to do to the hard thing because it was the right thing.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;But as I said above, it&rsquo;s not that way. Jaime attacked Ned and fought Robb but Sansa trusts Brienne&rsquo;s word; why can&rsquo;t she trust Jon&rsquo;s? Is she threatened by the lack of power, or can she justify her anger?<b> This makes the audience dislike both Dany and Sansa, feel indifference to Arya, and leave out Jon from his very own plotline.&nbsp;</b></p><p>It&rsquo;s just as Tyrion said&nbsp;\"You seem determined to dislike [Dany]&rdquo;. And so does she show itself. The story has been going out of their way to make Dany dislikable. Snappy, stubborn, cold, petty. They want you to think&nbsp;&ldquo;Damn, what a bitch&rdquo;, so you can side with Sansa. And some try, but it&rsquo;s simply too bitter on all sides to side with anyone. <b>Tyrion is too torn to side with anyone, because he&rsquo;s too compassionate, but the way it&rsquo;s headed, it seems compassion is a weakness in this Game of Thrones. </b>You&rsquo;d rather stop watching the show that find out what happens next.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not even <i>mentioning</i> the stories of Brienne, Cersei, Euron, the Hound, Gendry, Davos, and Jaime. What!! The!! Heck!!&nbsp;</p><p>Where is the hope for the future? Where is the unity? Where is the fight against darkness? Not the actual physical fight, but the humane struggle for good?

The brightness was creeping in, making him aware of the dull pounding of a headache, courtesy of rum, his eyelids feeling like sandpaper over his eyes. </p><p><br/></p><p>But, all of that was forgotten, even the warmth of the sun after the summer storm, because there was a greater warmth curled into him. Soft snores tickled his ears, a slim leg tucked possessively over his, his right arm numb under her slight weight.</p><p><br/></p><p>Gods, it had seemed like such a good idea the night before, scooping her up in his arms, the rain drenching them both as he carried her inside, her face tucked into his shoulder. He hadn\u2019t been able to bring himself to put her into her nest on the floor\u2014 her bed still off limits\u2014 so he had done the only thing he could and tucked her into his bed.</p><p><br/></p><p>It had seemed like a brilliant idea at the time, and since he was a grown arsed man who could control his impulses and urges, he had crawled into the covers on his side, not sure if the spinning world was from the alcohol or from his first taste of Daenerys Targaryen. </p><p><br/></p><p>Considering he was still weightless and turning, but without the nausea of a hangover, it had to be her.</p><p><br/></p><p>Fuck, he was so done for. The previous night had been the final crack that toppled the wall, and that was before he\u2019d even kissed her. No, that decision had been made the moment his fingers had curled around that shot glass to follow the rules she\u2019d sternly laid out. Now he stood in the rubble of what had been his rules, the dirt and debris of the safety net he\u2019d been hiding behind, finally out in the open and willing to see the consequences.</p><p><br/></p><p>And all because he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her not understanding how godsdamned wonderful she was\u2014 how she made him want to climb out of the icy cage that he\u2019d been stuck in, just to be around her and soak up that endless fire she provided.</p><p><br/></p><p>The breathing against his skin broke, breath catching, her palm sliding down his abdomen\u2014 in hindsight, he should have kept his shirt on\u2014 as she shifted, and he caught her hand carefully, pressed a soft kiss to the inside of her wrist in apology, already hard and aching for her.</p><p><br/></p><p>For a moment he let himself fantasize about rolling her onto her back and waking her up in other pleasurable manners, before getting lost inside of her, but it wasn\u2019t right yet.

Jon\u2019s show him in the same position than his (adoptive) father, therefore linking him to his Stark legacy rather than to the Targaryen family, and connecting his arc to the weight of politics and of bearing the future of a kingdom on his shoulders. Daenerys wears red gloves that metaphorically echoes the hands covered with blood, among many other meanings. Cersei wears the dress she wears when she kills Missandei, when she learns that Rhaegal is dead and when she makes the smallfolk enter the Red Keep: this is symbolic of her victory over Daenerys (for now. It might take other meanings later). Jaime wears his travelling clothes, linking him to his two most important moments in the season: coming to Winterfell to keep his oath and fight (choosing Brienne), and coming back to Cersei to fulfill their destinies. Theon\u2019s armor is broken at the point where the Night King pierced his armor to kill him, echoing his death and his recovered identity.
