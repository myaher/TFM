He seemed more and more distant and seemed to have lost that spark in his normally blazing green eyes.</p><p>Instantly Draco thought it was his fault.</p><p>So he tried to cheer Harry up.</p><p>He did things he wouldn&rsquo;t normally do, like he&rsquo;d take Harry to those huge muggle moving pictures he seemed loved so much, he even began to go have dinner with the Weasley&rsquo;s and have civil conversations with the abnormally ginger family.</p><p>But nothing worked</p><p><b>Anything it takes to make you stay~</b></p><p>He tried to talk to Harry, he really did but then Harry would put on that fake smile and pretend that everything was alright completely ignoring his question.</p><p>He asked Granger and Weasley about it but they just said that they don&rsquo;t see what he was talking about and that maybe Harry was just tired.</p><p>Draco knew that wasn&rsquo;t the case. </p><p>He knew his boyfriend, he knew that Harry was more then just &ldquo;tired&rdquo;.</p><p><b>Only seeing myself when I&rsquo;m looking up at you~</b></p><p>He knew he should listen to everybody else and let Harry handle whatever he was going through by himself and he wouldn&rsquo;t want to come off as clingy but god dammit he loved Harry and you couldn&rsquo;t possibly expect him to just watch this happen.</p><p>So one especially depressing evening he confronted Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;IS IT ME!?!&rdquo; He screamed out as Harry and him sat in silence in the living room, he had been building this up for days and exploded in whirlpool of emotions. He felt the tears begin to form in his eyes, &ldquo;Have I done something? Why won&rsquo;t you talk to me for fucksake?!?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s beautifully dim green eyes grew into saucers at the accusations.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you on about?&rdquo; Harry asked with a false grin on, tears fell more as Draco witnessed that smile he was supposed to love but as of right now it made his stomach twist violently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Standing up from his seat on the couch, he loomed over Harry who was still sitting down. </p><p>His tears had began to fall from his eyes and he bit his lip to stop himself from sobbing. Gently kneeling down in front of the man he loved, he placed a pale hand softly on one tanned cheek.</p><p>The shade difference of their skin clashing perfectly.</p><p>&ldquo;Please Harry,&rdquo; his voice broken as he proper began to beg his lover, &ldquo;talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your talki-&rdquo; &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T&rdquo; </p><p>Draco cut him off instantly, he couldn&rsquo;t dare let Harry finish that dismissive sentence. He needed to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he repeated but more calmly then the first time, &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry tried, Draco could see the struggle as he tried to put that false smile back on but he seemed to crumble a bit like he was forcing a broken mask back onto his face.</p><p>Harry knew Draco could tell.</p><p>Wrapping his long arms around the bigger boy, he pulled him down for a well deserved hug and just seemed to hold him there. No one made a move to separate.</p><p>Draco knew not to comment when his shoulder got significantly wetter nor did he react when Harry wrapped his arms around his waist far more tighter then he normally would, as if he was terrified to let him go. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here Harry,&rdquo; he whispered different comforting phrases into the ear of the broken boy, &ldquo;I just want you to talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; Harry sobbed out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Dray, I&rsquo;m so sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sshh,&rdquo; Draco hushed him up, even though he wanted Harry to talk to him. </p><p>He soon realized that talking wasn&rsquo;t the best option right now. I mean, they had all night to talk about problems and comfort the other but right now, at this moment, what if they just hold the other and maybe never let go.</p><p><b>I want you, I&rsquo;ll color me blue~</b></p><p><b>Anything it takes to make you stay~</b></p><p><b>Only seeing myself when I&rsquo;m looking up at you~</b></p><p>(I really hope this doesn&rsquo;t suck because I tried to make angst and I&rsquo;m not the best at angst. Thank you still.)</p>",

A major problem in writing today is that if the protagonist is a girl, then it is assumed that it is a book for girls and that boys would have no interest in it. A female protagonist means a book is suitable only for female readers. This is a tragedy because it teaches little girls that their stories are less important and less interesting, that girls cannot be the protagonists in a story where there are strong male characters. If Harry Potter were a girl, we would be one step closer to the destandardization of the male protagonist. (I refuse to believe that, even if it were originally marketed to girls, Harry Potter would be any less famous or widely read. People don\u2019t read Harry Potter because the protagonist is a male. They read it because the world-building, characters, and story are f*cking fantastic.)</p><p>Secondly, Harry Potter is an average character. If Harry Potter were a girl, it would teach little girls that it\u2019s okay to not always be the smartest or the bravest: being average is acceptable. Hermione is a fantastic character, but she is most noteworthy for her intelligence and studiousness. This adheres to a stereotype that teaches girls that they have to be noteworthy to matter. Men are allowed to be average in our society, but women must always be exceptional if they want recognition. If Harry Potter were a woman, we would be one step closer to social change in this area.</p><p>Thirdly, there would be actual lgbt+ content in the series.

It didn\u2019t have to be a big deal! The word\u00a0\u2018lesbian\u2019 didn\u2019t need to be in the books, just like the fact that Harry and Ginny\u2019s relationship is not characterized primarily by the fact that it is heterosexual. Jo could have just treated being lgbt+ as normal, yet acknowledged it in the books. And then we would have a book in the mainstream media with real lgbt+ content and a fantasy world in which being lgbt+ is normal and children could read about a world where they could be accepted as normal no matter what. Again, one step closer to the social change we need.
