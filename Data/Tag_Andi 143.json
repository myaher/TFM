The show was honored by the Television Academy last year, which are the same people behind the Emmy\u2019s. It makes me wonder whether or not Disney has even been submitting or pushing for a nomination. They haven\u2019t won an Emmy for any series other than Wizards of Waverly Place (that I can remember?) and the only thing they\u2019ve nominated the last two years was a Star Wars series. But before that they were nominating Girl Meets World, Dog With A Blog, etc. so it really doesn\u2019t make sense that Andi Mack hasn\u2019t even been nominated yet.</p>",

In the middle of all of the chaos Cyrus sat patiently, waiting for his friends to get back from dancing.</p><p>The biggest school dance of the year and Cyrus sat alone, hoping someone would ask him to dance. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t Tj Kippen.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus! Come dance with us!&rdquo; Andi yelled over the music and motioned Cyrus to come over. Amber stood by Andi side, holding her hand. They were a really good couple. Even though Cyrus wanted to go with them, this was their official date.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay Andi, go have fun with Amber!&rdquo; As much fun as sitting alone at a school dance was, Cyrus didn&rsquo;t want to ruin Andi and Amber&rsquo;s night. Amber gave Cyrus a concerned look, making him feel uncomfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to go get some punch!&rdquo; Cyrus screamed as many voice cracks escaped his mouth. Andi and Amber nodded and danced away, letting the music engulf them with every beat.</p><p>Cyrus ran over to the punch bowl just as a slow song started. Why was romance so hard for him? Maybe because Cyrus had a massive crush on his bestfriend, Tj Kippen. All Cyrus could think about was Tj. The way his eyes looked when he got competitive, or when he saw Cyrus get hurt. The worst part of the crush is that Tj was straight. Cyrus was sure of it. A buzz from Cyrus&rsquo;s pocket startled him. Cyrus put down his cup of punch and grabbed his phone. A text from Tj stared back at him.</p><p>CRUSH\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf5e: Where are you? I&rsquo;m a little lost. </p><p>ChocoMuf\ud83e\udd17: Punch bowl, why?</p><p>CRUSH\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf5e: On my way. </p><p>Cyrus looked up from him phone to see Tj walking towards him. God, hes so perfect. Tj&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat when his eyes met Cyrus&rsquo;s deep brown ones. Tj being the weird man that he is, gave himself a short pep talk. &ldquo;Alright Tj, you got this. Why is he sooo cute and short.&rdquo; Tj assumed that Cyrus felt the same way as him, you know head over heals for him. </p><p>A smile lit up Cyrus&rsquo;s face as Tj got closer. &ldquo;Its now or never Cyrus. Just ask him to dance.&rdquo; Cyrus took a deep breath and ran toward Tj, only stumbling once or twice. &ldquo;UNDERDOG!&rdquo; Tj grabbed Cyrus&rsquo;s shoulders, the touch made both boys faces bright red. Before Tj could say anything, Cyrus spoke with the little confidence he had.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I dance with you? Like right now? Please? I really like you, you know that right?&rdquo; Cyrus let out the breath he didn&rsquo;t know he was holding in. Tj stood holding Cyrus, stunned. Did Cyrus Goodman just make a move on him? He couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p><p>&ldquo;Tj the song is going to end.&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled hoping Tj wouldn&rsquo;t hate him. Tj let go of Cyrus&rsquo;s shoulders and stared into his eyes, his longing eyes. Cyrus&rsquo;s heart dropped, feeling the hatred radiating off of Tj. Why did he have to put his feelings out there? In front of everyone. </p><p>Tears started to form in Cyrus&rsquo;s eyes, he just lost everything. Tj turned around and walked toward the dance floor. Cyrus glanced at the ground and back at Tj. Cyrus tried to swallow but he couldn&rsquo;t, watching Tj walk away was torture.</p><p>Tj turned around once he reached the center of the dance floor, looking at the short boy who was falling apart. Tj instantly felt terrible for making him feel any pain.</p><p>&ldquo;Underdog! Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo; Tj said reaching his hand out for Cyrus to grab it. A grin formed across Tj&rsquo;s face. Cyrus, dazed stared at Tj, the tall boy who he wanted so much. A smile formed on Cyrus&rsquo;s face and his sadness turned into rays of happiness. Tears streamed down his face but he didn&rsquo;t feel any pain, as long as Tj wanted him he would always be beaming with joy.</p><p>Cyrus ran toward Tj and slammed into his body. Cyrus gave Tj the biggest hug he could offer. By now the love song had ended, now a killer dubstep song blared. That didn&rsquo;t bother Tj or Cyrus, because despite the music, everything was perfect.</p><p>&ldquo;That was a rude joke Mr. Kippen.&rdquo; Cyrus chuckled into Tj&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry muffin, how can I repay you?&rdquo; Tj rubbed Cyrus&rsquo;s back, trying to make him feel better.</p><p>Cyrus tilted his head up and stared at the scary basketball boy. This time he wasn&rsquo;t scary, he was scared. Scared of losing Cyrus even though he just got him. It took Tj so long to have Cyrus and losing him now would be horrible. Tj put his hand on Cyrus&rsquo;s face, tilting it up just a little more. Cyrus smiled and got lost in Tj&rsquo;s eyes. Out of nowhere Cyrus stood on his top toes and closed the gap between him and Tj. Forming the best kiss Jefferson Middle School had ever seen. After many short lived seconds Cyrus pulled away from Tj. </p><p>&ldquo;I think you just did.&rdquo; Cyrus chuckled pulling Tj back into a hug and swaying to the ridiculous music.</p><p>A/N: Thank you for reading! Even though I know it was cringey. It was my first fan fiction, so im sorry. Hope I can redeem myself later! \ud83d\udc9a</p>",
