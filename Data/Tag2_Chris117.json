We are not in any way affiliated with Chris Evans, his team, Marvel, Christopher's Haven, or the Red Cross.  The inspiration for this campaign came from the Hiddlestoners Have Heart campaign.  Let's wish one of our favorite actors, Chris Evans, a wonderful birthday!",

        "answer": "<p>I hope you like this! The unnamed baby girl here is essentially a self insert for my own 18 month old daughter, so hopefully that leads to some authenticity \ud83d\ude02 thank you for the request!! </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Chris sighed, lightly bouncing his fussy baby girl with one arm while the other shuffled through a cabinet in search of her sippy cup. She was smacking his bearded cheek and making her displeasure well known, her cute little face all scrunched up and bright blue eyes watery with tears, and Chris was determined to turn her frown upside down and find the source of her angst. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAll right, here we go,\u201d he said, sippy cup in hand at last as he moved to the fridge. \u201cNow I know we\u2019re not supposed to give you this stuff very often but desperate times and all&hellip;\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>After filling up her cup with diluted organic apple juice, he secured the lid and then handed it to the baby with a bright smile. \u201cWant some juice? It\u2019s yummy!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>She took the cup from his hand and immediately tossed it on the floor, then threw her head back and let out a mighty wail that wiped the smile right off of Chris\u2019 face. </p><p><br/></p><p>Oh boy. </p><p><!-- more --></p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Chris decided, patting her on her back and stepping out of the kitchen. \u201cPlan B it is.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Plan B turned out to be camping out in the living room in front of <i>Frozen</i>, which Chris really tried not to resort to but sometimes his little girl just needed a daily dose of Disney to get out of a bad mood and he couldn\u2019t begrudge her that. He was also going to choose his battles wisely on this particular day, considering that this was Seb\u2019s first \u201cday off\u201d in ages and he wanted to make it go as smoothly as possible for everyone involved. </p><p><br/></p><p>While he and Seb tried to parent their daughter as equally as possible, their schedules had led to Sebastian being home with her for the last three months straight while Chris was all over the place working on his latest film. As a result, she had grown incredibly attached to Sebastian as she was 18 months old and entering an extremely clingy stage of toddlerhood, and while Sebastian didn\u2019t mind her being his own little personal (and adorable) shadow, he didn\u2019t get a lot of time to himself. Today was the first day in a long time that Chris had been able to stay home and tell Seb to go meet a few friends, have lunch, get a haircut, do whatever the hell he wanted while Chris held down the fort. </p><p><br/></p><p>But, unsurprisingly, she had wanted Seb and more specifically, his shoulder-length hair. It was her security blanket, her tiny hands always buried in his locks and playing with them, hardly able to fall asleep without it. Chris knew the day would be a bit of a challenge but he also knew that it would be good for all three of them, especially Sebastian whom he knew needed a decent break. </p><p><br/></p><p>Thankfully, the baby settled down once Frozen got going and snuggled up with Chris on the couch, plastered to his side and playing absently with his beard in lieu of Sebastian\u2019s long hair. She seemed a little frustrated at the lack of length but she made do, sucking on her favorite pacifier as well while she watched the movie, and Chris\u2019 slightly frayed nerves calmed down right along with her own. They didn\u2019t even make it to <i>Let It Go</i> before she fell fast asleep, snoozing peacefully on his chest after he repositioned her to get them both more comfortable. </p><p><br/></p><p>Chris smiled and kissed her mop of dark brown hair, rubbing her back and basking in the sweetness of the moment. He\u2019d missed her like crazy while he\u2019d been gone and had been afraid that she would somehow forget him, but she hadn\u2019t and their bond was still strong. She might prefer Seb to him a bit but that was okay and only natural after how long it had been just the two of them. And now that Chris was back, they could work on evening things out a bit. </p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian returned home from his blessed day out and found his husband and daughter passed out on the couch, the <i>Frozen</i> Blu Ray menu playing in a loop in the background. Sebastian grinned and set down his bags, sliding off his jacket and snapping a few pics of them just in time before Chris\u2019 eyes fluttered open. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey sweetheart,\u201d Chris smiled, speaking quietly so as to not wake the baby. \u201cYou have fun?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI had a great day,\u201d Sebastian smiled back, heading over to the couch and sitting down gently at Chris\u2019 side. \u201cHow\u2019d it go with her?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt went great,\u201d Chris grinned. \u201cFew bumps in the road but we figured it out. I told you you didn\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian smiled gratefully and leaned in to press a gentle kiss to Chris\u2019 lips. \u201cThank you, Chris.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me,\u201d Chris murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do considering how long I\u2019ve been gone.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian shrugged and rubbed his palm over his daughter\u2019s back, watching her sleep. \u201cI knew what I was getting into. We both did.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris nodded lightly, and then they both froze when the baby began to stir. She squirmed a bit on his chest before lifting her head and cracking her eyes open, spotting Sebastian almost immediately and smiling as she reached for him. He grinned and took her in his arms, kissing her cheek and saying, \u201cHey, munchkin. I missed your sweet little face.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>She snuggled right up on his chest, both hands burying into his long hair and eyes closing happily as she drifted back to sleep the very moment she had his hair back in her little fists.

He was also going to choose his battles wisely on this particular day, considering that this was Seb\u2019s first \u201cday off\u201d in ages and he wanted to make it go as smoothly as possible for everyone involved. </p><p><br></p><p>While he and Seb tried to parent their daughter as equally as possible, their schedules had led to Sebastian being home with her for the last three months straight while Chris was all over the place working on his latest film. As a result, she had grown incredibly attached to Sebastian as she was 18 months old and entering an extremely clingy stage of toddlerhood, and while Sebastian didn\u2019t mind her being his own little personal (and adorable) shadow, he didn\u2019t get a lot of time to himself. Today was the first day in a long time that Chris had been able to stay home and tell Seb to go meet a few friends, have lunch, get a haircut, do whatever the hell he wanted while Chris held down the fort. </p><p><br></p><p>But, unsurprisingly, she had wanted Seb and more specifically, his shoulder-length hair. It was her security blanket, her tiny hands always buried in his locks and playing with them, hardly able to fall asleep without it. Chris knew the day would be a bit of a challenge but he also knew that it would be good for all three of them, especially Sebastian whom he knew needed a decent break. </p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, the baby settled down once Frozen got going and snuggled up with Chris on the couch, plastered to his side and playing absently with his beard in lieu of Sebastian\u2019s long hair. She seemed a little frustrated at the lack of length but she made do, sucking on her favorite pacifier as well while she watched the movie, and Chris\u2019 slightly frayed nerves calmed down right along with her own. They didn\u2019t even make it to <i>Let It Go</i> before she fell fast asleep, snoozing peacefully on his chest after he repositioned her to get them both more comfortable. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris smiled and kissed her mop of dark brown hair, rubbing her back and basking in the sweetness of the moment. He\u2019d missed her like crazy while he\u2019d been gone and had been afraid that she would somehow forget him, but she hadn\u2019t and their bond was still strong. She might prefer Seb to him a bit but that was okay and only natural after how long it had been just the two of them. And now that Chris was back, they could work on evening things out a bit. </p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian returned home from his blessed day out and found his husband and daughter passed out on the couch, the <i>Frozen</i> Blu Ray menu playing in a loop in the background. Sebastian grinned and set down his bags, sliding off his jacket and snapping a few pics of them just in time before Chris\u2019 eyes fluttered open. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey sweetheart,\u201d Chris smiled, speaking quietly so as to not wake the baby. \u201cYou have fun?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI had a great day,\u201d Sebastian smiled back, heading over to the couch and sitting down gently at Chris\u2019 side. \u201cHow\u2019d it go with her?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt went great,\u201d Chris grinned. \u201cFew bumps in the road but we figured it out. I told you you didn\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian smiled gratefully and leaned in to press a gentle kiss to Chris\u2019 lips. \u201cThank you, Chris.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me,\u201d Chris murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do considering how long I\u2019ve been gone.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian shrugged and rubbed his palm over his daughter\u2019s back, watching her sleep. \u201cI knew what I was getting into. We both did.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris nodded lightly, and then they both froze when the baby began to stir. She squirmed a bit on his chest before lifting her head and cracking her eyes open, spotting Sebastian almost immediately and smiling as she reached for him. He grinned and took her in his arms, kissing her cheek and saying, \u201cHey, munchkin. I missed your sweet little face.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She snuggled right up on his chest, both hands burying into his long hair and eyes closing happily as she drifted back to sleep the very moment she had his hair back in her little fists.

They didn&rsquo;t even make it to <i>Let It Go</i> before she fell fast asleep, snoozing peacefully on his chest after he repositioned her to get them both more comfortable. </p><p><br /></p><p>Chris smiled and kissed her mop of dark brown hair, rubbing her back and basking in the sweetness of the moment. He&rsquo;d missed her like crazy while he&rsquo;d been gone and had been afraid that she would somehow forget him, but she hadn&rsquo;t and their bond was still strong. She might prefer Seb to him a bit but that was okay and only natural after how long it had been just the two of them. And now that Chris was back, they could work on evening things out a bit. </p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian returned home from his blessed day out and found his husband and daughter passed out on the couch, the <i>Frozen</i> Blu Ray menu playing in a loop in the background. Sebastian grinned and set down his bags, sliding off his jacket and snapping a few pics of them just in time before Chris&rsquo; eyes fluttered open. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey sweetheart,&rdquo; Chris smiled, speaking quietly so as to not wake the baby. &ldquo;You have fun?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I had a great day,&rdquo; Sebastian smiled back, heading over to the couch and sitting down gently at Chris&rsquo; side. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d it go with her?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It went great,&rdquo; Chris grinned. &ldquo;Few bumps in the road but we figured it out. I told you you didn&rsquo;t have to worry.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian smiled gratefully and leaned in to press a gentle kiss to Chris&rsquo; lips. &ldquo;Thank you, Chris.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to thank me,&rdquo; Chris murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least I can do considering how long I&rsquo;ve been gone.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian shrugged and rubbed his palm over his daughter&rsquo;s back, watching her sleep. &ldquo;I knew what I was getting into. We both did.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris nodded lightly, and then they both froze when the baby began to stir. She squirmed a bit on his chest before lifting her head and cracking her eyes open, spotting Sebastian almost immediately and smiling as she reached for him. He grinned and took her in his arms, kissing her cheek and saying, &ldquo;Hey, munchkin. I missed your sweet little face.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>She snuggled right up on his chest, both hands burying into his long hair and eyes closing happily as she drifted back to sleep the very moment she had his hair back in her little fists. Chris chuckled and said, &ldquo;I thought you said you were gonna get your hair cut.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Sebastian sighed, &ldquo;but then I decided I couldn&rsquo;t do that to her. She loves my hair so much and it&rsquo;s such a comfort to her&hellip; just didn&rsquo;t feel right.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris smiled, gazing at his two favorite people in the whole world and feeling more content than he had previously ever believed would be possible. He&rsquo;d missed them both more than words could ever say, and now that they had been reunited, he felt whole again. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Go on back to sleep, Chris,&rdquo; Seb murmured, laying his head on Chris&rsquo; shoulder. &ldquo;A family nap sounds damn good right now.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris let out a deep breath and kissed Sebastian&rsquo;s forehead, closing his eyes and letting his smile linger on his face. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.&rdquo;</p><p>Tagging a few who might like this: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAidATIEpHEyeBI44BIGmZg\">@captainrogerrsbeard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7eywmAnCn-B194usnbb0g\">@take-me-tom-hiddleston</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwhx6YCBRC0o8pVLu-XlDRQ\">@onehotgreasymechanic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNmpNeF1IEvFJtdv3jBcRxQ\">@musette22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkp4VvoKIpsrDxZYOAcilNQ\">@wintersoldier1989</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBqI8LnPiGL8rs8x0OVwT8A\">@its-a-pretty-interesting-wall</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8OfmJFLgMXkm8jOj9fs0qg\">@djchika</a> </p>",

The unnamed baby girl here is essentially a self insert for my own 18 month old daughter, so hopefully that leads to some authenticity &#128514; thank you for the request!! </p>\n<p>&mdash;</p>\n<p>Chris sighed, lightly bouncing his fussy baby girl with one arm while the other shuffled through a cabinet in search of her sippy cup. She was smacking his bearded cheek and making her displeasure well known, her cute little face all scrunched up and bright blue eyes watery with tears, and Chris was determined to turn her frown upside down and find the source of her angst. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;All right, here we go,&rdquo; he said, sippy cup in hand at last as he moved to the fridge. &ldquo;Now I know we&rsquo;re not supposed to give you this stuff very often but desperate times and all&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>After filling up her cup with diluted organic apple juice, he secured the lid and then handed it to the baby with a bright smile. &ldquo;Want some juice? It&rsquo;s yummy!&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>She took the cup from his hand and immediately tossed it on the floor, then threw her head back and let out a mighty wail that wiped the smile right off of Chris&rsquo; face. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Oh boy. </p>\n\n</p>",

You had no idea where you were going, but this time you didn&rsquo;t worry\u00a0because Chris was with you and you trusted him completely.</p><p>You were still so over the moon with the whole plan so far: what girl wouldn&rsquo;t like\u00a0to be surprised by the love of her life just like you were? Especially if that man was Chris, the gentleman who will always put his girl first and do everything in his power to make her happy.</p><p>The heat between you two was increasing. When the car stopped and you looked down at Chris, who had one hand\u00a0on your thigh and the other squeezing you butt gently, you noticed his lips were swollen and his breathing was a little erractic. You were in the exact same state.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s time for your third surprise this night&rdquo;, Chris said smiling at you, trying to regain composure.</p><p>You got off Chris&rsquo;s lap and started to straighten your clothes as well as your hair. Then, the chauffeur, who had exited the car, knocked at the door asking permission to open it. Chris told him it was okay, so he opened the door and offered you his hand, which you took and thanked.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bernard!&rdquo;, Chris said to him when he got out of the car, receiveing a nod from the other man.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, what place is this?&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t have any clue of your current location and the fact that Bernard had drop you at a dark kind of garage wasn&rsquo;t making it easier for you to guess where you were.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see&rdquo;, was all Chris answered while he led you to an elevator. Once you got into it and the doors closed, you couldn&rsquo;t help, but smirk at your boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve never made out in an elevator before&hellip;&rdquo;. Chris threw his head back and laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;It was difficult enough to control myself on our way &lsquo;til here. Please Y/N, have mercy on me!&rdquo;, he said feigning shock,\u00a0his try to supress a\u00a0smile making you laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, but you owe me that. Next time I won&rsquo;t be merciful&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise, babe&rdquo;, he couldn&rsquo;t not laugh at your almost serious expression at the last sentence.</p><p>When you managed to stop laughing, you realized the button pressed indicated that\u00a0you were going to the fiftieth floor. Chris had followed your eyes and when you gave him an inquisitive look,\u00a0he gave you a smug smile.\u00a0Once you stopped going up, your boyfriend looked at you\u00a0excitedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Here we are, sweetheart!&rdquo;</p><p>The doors opened and you exited the elavator. Then, your eyes went wide and your chin dropped. A dim light illuminated the entire place making it cozy.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God, Chris! I can&rsquo;t believe&hellip; you&hellip; we are at the Skywalk Observatory! How? It&rsquo;s past their closing time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I may\u00a0have some connections in the\u00a0building&rdquo;, he answered in a casual manner. &ldquo;Besides, I know how much you wanted to come, but never could for some reason&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much!&rdquo;, you turned around and hugged him\u00a0tight. He kissed the top of your head and you went back to one of the big windows that allowed you to see the whole city.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought the best moment to have a panoramic view of any city is at night. Look at that, Chris! All the apartment&rsquo;s lights, the cars moving so fast, the reflection of the lights on the river&hellip; all those things make Boston look\u00a0even\u00a0more beautiful&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, they do. But not more beautiful than you admiring it&rdquo;, your boyfriend said in a husky voice that made you turn to check him.</p><p>When your eyes landed on Chris, you saw him bent\u00a0down\u00a0on\u00a0one\u00a0knee\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0black\u00a0velvet\u00a0box on his hand. As that sight of him sank in, your eyes welled up and you started to chuckle nervously, your hands covering your mouth in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, these two years and ten months have been my favorite and the best ones I&rsquo;ve ever\u00a0lived because I have you. When I saw you for the first time, drinking at that pub, I knew you&rsquo;d play an important part in my life and this thought warmed my heart since that day. Then, you became my best friend and I couldn&rsquo;t not fall in love with your kind and beautiful heart. The day I confessed my feelings was the day I told you the first 'I love you&rsquo;, remember? And saying that too soon felt so right like it never did before because it was obvious to me that you were the one. Ever since, I dream about proposing and I had only to wait for the right moment, not only for me but for you too. So after our last conversations about marriage and raising a family, I felt the time had come and&hellip; here we are&rdquo;.</p><p>You could say how nervous he was, but at the same time, how determined and sure of his words. Words that melted your heart and made you cry like a child. Words that were so meaningful because they were always prooven by his attitude towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Christopher&rdquo;, you whispered softly\u00a0and he chuckled\u00a0because he knew that you always call him that way when you&rsquo;re very\u00a0emotional.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Y/N&rdquo;, he opened the box on his hand, revealing a white gold ring with a small oval blue sapphire on its center, three also\u00a0small diamonds on each side of the gemstone. &ldquo;Will you give me the honor of becoming my wife and make me the happiest man on the planet?&rdquo;</p><p>Since you were speechless, you could only bend down to him and kiss him with all the passion you had inside. Without separating your\u00a0mouths, Chris and you stood up and he lifted you\u00a0putting his arms around you waist.</p><p>When you stopped kissing and Chris put you down, you finally answered using words.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, one million yes!&rdquo;</p><p>Then, a grinning\u00a0Chris took the ring from its cushion and slid it on your finger.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much, Chris&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much too, Y/N&rdquo;</p><p>And you shared another kiss. This time, a slow and deep one.\u00a0</p><p>After some more minutes admiring the view, you decided it was time to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Poor Bernard is waiting for too long&rdquo;,\u00a0 you\u00a0smiled to\u00a0your fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright&rdquo;, Chris said holding your hand and taking you to the elevator.

You had no idea where you were going, but this time you didn&rsquo;t worry&nbsp;because Chris was with you and you trusted him completely.</p><p>You were still so over the moon with the whole plan so far: what girl wouldn&rsquo;t like&nbsp;to be surprised by the love of her life just like you were? Especially if that man was Chris, the gentleman who will always put his girl first and do everything in his power to make her happy.</p><p>The heat between you two was increasing. When the car stopped and you looked down at Chris, who had one hand&nbsp;on your thigh and the other squeezing you butt gently, you noticed his lips were swollen and his breathing was a little erractic. You were in the exact same state.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s time for your third surprise this night&rdquo;, Chris said smiling at you, trying to regain composure.</p><p>You got off Chris&rsquo;s lap and started to straighten your clothes as well as your hair. Then, the chauffeur, who had exited the car, knocked at the door asking permission to open it. Chris told him it was okay, so he opened the door and offered you his hand, which you took and thanked.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bernard!&rdquo;, Chris said to him when he got out of the car, receiveing a nod from the other man.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, what place is this?&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t have any clue of your current location and the fact that Bernard had drop you at a dark kind of garage wasn&rsquo;t making it easier for you to guess where you were.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see&rdquo;, was all Chris answered while he led you to an elevator. Once you got into it and the doors closed, you couldn&rsquo;t help, but smirk at your boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve never made out in an elevator before&hellip;&rdquo;. Chris threw his head back and laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;It was difficult enough to control myself on our way &lsquo;til here. Please Y/N, have mercy on me!&rdquo;, he said feigning shock,&nbsp;his try to supress a&nbsp;smile making you laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, but you owe me that. Next time I won&rsquo;t be merciful&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise, babe&rdquo;, he couldn&rsquo;t not laugh at your almost serious expression at the last sentence.</p><p>When you managed to stop laughing, you realized the button pressed indicated that&nbsp;you were going to the fiftieth floor. Chris had followed your eyes and when you gave him an inquisitive look,&nbsp;he gave you a smug smile.&nbsp;Once you stopped going up, your boyfriend looked at you&nbsp;excitedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Here we are, sweetheart!&rdquo;</p><p>The doors opened and you exited the elavator. Then, your eyes went wide and your chin dropped. A dim light illuminated the entire place making it cozy.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God, Chris! I can&rsquo;t believe&hellip; you&hellip; we are at the Skywalk Observatory! How? It&rsquo;s past their closing time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I may&nbsp;have some connections in the&nbsp;building&rdquo;, he answered in a casual manner. &ldquo;Besides, I know how much you wanted to come, but never could for some reason&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much!&rdquo;, you turned around and hugged him&nbsp;tight. He kissed the top of your head and you went back to one of the big windows that allowed you to see the whole city.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought the best moment to have a panoramic view of any city is at night. Look at that, Chris! All the apartment&rsquo;s lights, the cars moving so fast, the reflection of the lights on the river&hellip; all those things make Boston look&nbsp;even&nbsp;more beautiful&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, they do. But not more beautiful than you admiring it&rdquo;, your boyfriend said in a husky voice that made you turn to check him.</p><p>When your eyes landed on Chris, you saw him bent&nbsp;down&nbsp;on&nbsp;one&nbsp;knee&nbsp;with&nbsp;a&nbsp;black&nbsp;velvet&nbsp;box on his hand. As that sight of him sank in, your eyes welled up and you started to chuckle nervously, your hands covering your mouth in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, these two years and ten months have been my favorite and the best ones I&rsquo;ve ever&nbsp;lived because I have you. When I saw you for the first time, drinking at that pub, I knew you&rsquo;d play an important part in my life and this thought warmed my heart since that day. Then, you became my best friend and I couldn&rsquo;t not fall in love with your kind and beautiful heart. The day I confessed my feelings was the day I told you the first 'I love you&rsquo;, remember? And saying that too soon felt so right like it never did before because it was obvious to me that you were the one. Ever since, I dream about proposing and I had only to wait for the right moment, not only for me but for you too. So after our last conversations about marriage and raising a family, I felt the time had come and&hellip; here we are&rdquo;.</p><p>You could say how nervous he was, but at the same time, how determined and sure of his words. Words that melted your heart and made you cry like a child. Words that were so meaningful because they were always prooven by his attitude towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Christopher&rdquo;, you whispered softly&nbsp;and he chuckled&nbsp;because he knew that you always call him that way when you&rsquo;re very&nbsp;emotional.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Y/N&rdquo;, he opened the box on his hand, revealing a white gold ring with a small oval blue sapphire on its center, three also&nbsp;small diamonds on each side of the gemstone. &ldquo;Will you give me the honor of becoming my wife and make me the happiest man on the planet?&rdquo;</p><p>Since you were speechless, you could only bend down to him and kiss him with all the passion you had inside. Without separating your&nbsp;mouths, Chris and you stood up and he lifted you&nbsp;putting his arms around you waist.</p><p>When you stopped kissing and Chris put you down, you finally answered using words.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, one million yes!&rdquo;</p><p>Then, a grinning&nbsp;Chris took the ring from its cushion and slid it on your finger.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much, Chris&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much too, Y/N&rdquo;</p><p>And you shared another kiss. This time, a slow and deep one.&nbsp;</p><p>After some more minutes admiring the view, you decided it was time to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Poor Bernard is waiting for too long&rdquo;,&nbsp; you&nbsp;smiled to&nbsp;your fianc&eacute;e.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright&rdquo;, Chris said holding your hand and taking you to the elevator. Once you got into it and the doors&nbsp;closed behind you, it was his time to smirk at you.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, maybe that thing that I owe you will be paid sooner than you think&rdquo;.</p><p>You laughed and jump on him, crossing your legs around his waist.
