15?? ) into the campaign when she hasn\u2019t had the chance to meet actual resistance</li><li>this also brings up an important point: i don\u2019t actually think all of jester\u2019s actions are healthy. but expecting them all to be healthy isn\u2019t productive, and neither is demanding healthy actions / relationships from her and the people she connects with.\u00a0</li><ul><li>again! the reason i\u2019m such a huge fan of this is because this isn\u2019t actually real. exploring this kind of personality in a safe space is literally things like D&amp;D was made for!!! and especially for the critical role cast, who i can trust to delve into the Not Healthy character traits and explore it in really interesting ways, i\u2019m just excited to see where it\u2019ll go.</li></ul><li>the point is i want her to learn all of these things and experience all the things she never had the chance to and WATCH HER GROW!! SHE HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL!!</li></ul><li>bonus round: idk if i actually want someone to tell jester all these things or if i want her to just&hellip; slowly mature naturally with her own realisations or if i want her to just TIP THE OTHER WAY, all these possibilities are SO INTERESTING TO ME<br/></li></ul><p>wow this got long</p>",
