With that gut punch out of the way, let\u2019s get into it. Infinity War and Endgame both have very different feels from one another, as if they\u2019d both been directed by two different people. From what I\u2019ve seen of the Russos\u2019 work, in this franchise at least, they tend to have that serious, realistic vibe to their movies in a way that DC comics utterly fails with theirs. I mean, Civil War, while not being my favorite movie in the franchise, was a really fantastic movie and did the\u00a0\u201cgritty realism\u201d tone very well. They also produced one of the most well-loved Marvel movies of all time, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which genuinely made Marvel movies what we know they are today. And in that vein, I think that Infinity War <i>feels</i>\u00a0a lot like those movies, but Endgame? Nope. It has a dark, depressing tone about it, as if the whole thing, beginning to end, is just one long funeral, and I think that was the point, cause it kinda was. I mean, half of the characters, including the most beloved Marvel character of all time (Spidey), were dead, including fan favorites, like Black Panther, Loki, and all of the Guardians.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"472\" data-orig-height=\"472\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tomandharrisongifs:eOj6ycpK2ijy_1JRXJ6p_Q:Zdoi8e2WUnGXa\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1bf93cd297bf800d876ba0669f0c1b7e/tumblr_p69glcN0wX1wntxaco1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"472\" data-orig-height=\"472\"/></figure><p>But probably the biggest difference between the two was Thanos. He felt like a genuinely different person. Gone was the somewhat sympathetic, yet still very evil deflated plum, replaced by an egotistical psychopath with a god complex. And the differences aren\u2019t even subtle. So what happened? Well, the reason that I think Infinity War and Endgame are so different was because the two of them were set through two different perspectives. In Endgame, it was pretty clear that Tony was the protagonist, but in Infinity War, it isn\u2019t very clear. The plot is scattered throughout three different big settings, on Titan, in Wakanda, and on Vormir, each scene having a different tone and feel to them. For example, Titan had a\u00a0\u201csunset\u201d vibe, as if the sun was setting on everyone\u2019s time there on Titan, indicating that, no, they would not win there. Wakanda had a\u00a0\u201cnew day\u201d sort of vibe, and seeing as it was the last stop on Thanos\u2019 list, we figured that it would be the location that the Avengers would win the battle, and if they weren\u2019t planning on pulling the rug out from under us, we\u2019d have been right. And Vormir is special because it has this magical, mystical vibe, as if it is taking place within Twilight, which makes sense since it is a magical, mystical place. And despite all of that, there is still one constant in the plot, one character that connects everything together: Thanos. *cue the gasps*</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gypsyastronaut:EfuZhhwKen6xjjgRfe6gTg:ZY-Qxv2Z-yO2M\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8cc7f55739fb98a9872480409959f285/tumblr_pc69fju44R1rpduwho2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"372\"/></figure><p>Yes, you heard me correctly, Thanos, the big, ugly grape dude who killed off Peter Parker, is Infinity War\u2019s protagonist.

Historically, they have only ever, <i>ever </i>done this for the main protagonist(s) of the film. Iron Man? Iron Man will return. Captain America? Captain America will return. The Avengers? The Avengers will return. Every time without fail they have put the protagonists and <i>only</i>\u00a0the protagonists in that slot there. So, where does that leave us? Well, it explains why the two movies were so distinctly different. Each major scene\u2019s tone was reflected through his eyes. Vormir? A beautiful and slightly mystical atmosphere with a somber tone, because Gamora is dead but he is collecting the Soul Stone. Titan? The sun setting on the time that half the universe has. Wakanda? A bright, sunny atmosphere where literally nothing could possibly go wrong with his plan and no one can stand in his way. That\u2019s why we get that weird Gamora in the soul stone flash back and why we see him sitting on his farm in the final scene as the sun rises on a new era of his making. It is a beautiful, spectacular movie and I cannot stress that enough, even if the protagonist is a rotten prune and half of the universe dies, and this symbolism is a huge part of why that is.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"201\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c962b6c42e890ebaa4b8e8ddab0b9ebe/tumblr_inline_pt29wn5Cnx1vponwo_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"201\"/></figure><p>So now, let\u2019s talk about Endgame Thanos. He is cold, evil, and nothing like his Infinity War self, but honestly, is that a big shock to anyone? I mean, in literally every other movie, he has been an evil, dangerous tyrant, then he shows up in Infinity War as a misunderstood bad boy and everyone just&hellip; accepts it? No, no, no, no. What we have here is a case of there-are-two-sides-to-every-story-itis. Thanos <i>is</i>\u00a0a power-hungry dictator who wants death and destruction and his actions in Infinity War, killing off innocent people and killing anyone who gets in his way, or attempting to, but we just think that it is flawed story telling because we don\u2019t realize that it is all being told from inside of Thanos\u2019 twisted mind. Endgame Thanos is the true Thanos. The gross raisin of death who throws a tantrum when he doesn\u2019t get his way and wants to play with people\u2019s lives like they\u2019re dolls, that is who he really is. <strike>(Christ, I never realized how much like Light he actually is.)</strike></p><p><b><strike>________________________________________________________________</strike></b></p><p>Hey guys!

I never really liked making theories about Marvel movies, mostly because I was always dead wrong, but also because I really didn\u2019t want them to disappoint me. Like, when I make a theory about them, I bring my expectations into the theater with me to watch the movie and feel like it\u2019s not as good as what I was expecting, you know?

He felt like a genuinely different person. Gone was the somewhat sympathetic, yet still very evil deflated plum, replaced by an egotistical psychopath with a god complex. And the differences aren\u2019t even subtle. So what happened? Well, the reason that I think Infinity War and Endgame are so different was because the two of them were set through two different perspectives. In Endgame, it was pretty clear that Tony was the protagonist, but in Infinity War, it isn\u2019t very clear. The plot is scattered throughout three different big settings, on Titan, in Wakanda, and on Vormir, each scene having a different tone and feel to them. For example, Titan had a\u00a0\u201csunset\u201d vibe, as if the sun was setting on everyone\u2019s time there on Titan, indicating that, no, they would not win there. Wakanda had a\u00a0\u201cnew day\u201d sort of vibe, and seeing as it was the last stop on Thanos\u2019 list, we figured that it would be the location that the Avengers would win the battle, and if they weren\u2019t planning on pulling the rug out from under us, we\u2019d have been right. And Vormir is special because it has this magical, mystical vibe, as if it is taking place within Twilight, which makes sense since it is a magical, mystical place. And despite all of that, there is still one constant in the plot, one character that connects everything together: Thanos. *cue the gasps*</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gypsyastronaut:EfuZhhwKen6xjjgRfe6gTg:ZY-Qxv2Z-yO2M\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8cc7f55739fb98a9872480409959f285/tumblr_pc69fju44R1rpduwho2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"372\"></figure><p>Yes, you heard me correctly, Thanos, the big, ugly grape dude who killed off Peter Parker, is Infinity War\u2019s protagonist.

Apologies for that <i>major</i>&nbsp;spoiler there. If that hadn&rsquo;t cued you in, though, this whole post is gonna be riddled with spoilers for Endgame and, yes, Infinity War, too, so if you haven&rsquo;t seen them, duck out of this post now. (Just a really quick tid-bit: do y&rsquo;all remember when we thought that everyone who died was in the soul world? Oops.)</p><p>So, let&rsquo;s talk about Infinity War and Endgame, the unofficial two part Avengers movie, both of which were equally devastating, maybe even more so for Endgame because Tony isn&rsquo;t coming back, at least not as RDJ. With that gut punch out of the way, let&rsquo;s get into it. Infinity War and Endgame both have very different feels from one another, as if they&rsquo;d both been directed by two different people. From what I&rsquo;ve seen of the Russos&rsquo; work, in this franchise at least, they tend to have that serious, realistic vibe to their movies in a way that DC comics utterly fails with theirs. I mean, Civil War, while not being my favorite movie in the franchise, was a really fantastic movie and did the&nbsp;&ldquo;gritty realism&rdquo; tone very well. They also produced one of the most well-loved Marvel movies of all time, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which genuinely made Marvel movies what we know they are today. And in that vein, I think that Infinity War <i>feels</i>&nbsp;a lot like those movies, but Endgame? Nope. It has a dark, depressing tone about it, as if the whole thing, beginning to end, is just one long funeral, and I think that was the point, cause it kinda was. I mean, half of the characters, including the most beloved Marvel character of all time (Spidey), were dead, including fan favorites, like Black Panther, Loki, and all of the Guardians.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>But probably the biggest difference between the two was Thanos.
