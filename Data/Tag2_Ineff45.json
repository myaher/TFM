                "content": "<p>Good Omens passengers!au not based off the disaster that is the movie but based off <a href=\"https://en-sam-malas.tumblr.com/post/170178928107/thecheshirecass-meredithmcclaren-someone\" target=\"_blank\">this post</a> where Aziraphale is the android bar tender who at first is just an android who thinks like an android, moves like an android, and who&rsquo;s life is all about cleaning glasses that have never been used and whose existence is narrowed down to just this bar and its empty seats, this long 90 year journey upon a ship called Eden. he was made to wait, to serve, to make cocktails and easy conversation. and then one day, to end up in a landfill on some distant planet, never to awake again.</p><p>so imagine his surprise when, one day, in comes a very confused, very pissed off man who should be asleep. it&rsquo;s 10 years into the journey. there&rsquo;s still 80 years ahead of them. he shouldn&rsquo;t be awake he should be asleep. yet here is this passenger, with an endearing lisp and a shock of deep deep red upon his head, standing upright and telling Aziraphale that he&rsquo;s going to die, he&rsquo;s going to die before he gets to do what he had wanted to do, what he had boarded this godforsaken ship to do, so can he have a glass of their finest sherry please? thank you.</p><p>this passenger is Crowley, and as the days progress, the reality of the situation gets less and less dire when Crowley starts to accept his fate, his horrid luck, and begins to make the most out of his situation. suddenly, Aziraphale&rsquo;s days are no longer just about his bar and his glasses, but now more and more about this<i> </i>anxious<i> </i>optimist who drowns his qualms about living in drink and Aziraphale&rsquo;s company, in turning all the floors of the Eden ship into actual Eden, who goes to each sleeping pod with Aziraphale in tow, talking to those inside, having hacked into their files to pass the time, telling them stories. making up some of his own.</p><p>And Aziraphale is an android, through and through. but he&rsquo;d been programmed to be a <i>learning</i> android, so that he could adapt, be the easy going stranger-friend every bar tender is to their punch drunk patrons. and the longer he is with Crowley, the more and more he becomes less like an android and more like a human, who fusses over this man who drinks far more than usual, who was lonely way before boarding, and who is even more lonely now. who little by little opens up to Aziraphale until they&rsquo;re both laughing like old friends, until Crowley drags his sleeping pod into the room Aziraphale&rsquo;s bar is in, until he says; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be away from you for too long&ndash; you&rsquo;re all I have.&rdquo;</p><p>and it&rsquo;s true. Crowley has no one else. but Aziraphale&rsquo;s learned to tell the difference between what is true on the surface and what is true beneath it all. they&rsquo;ve become something, them two. something intertwined and in sync. Aziraphale has become all Crowley is not willing to lose. and Crowley is all Aziraphale has, too.</p><p>but Crowley is human. and Aziraphale is an android. years go by. plants grow. stories, both made up and real, take on twists and turns. red hair turns grey. wrinkles form around eyes. hands that had let all the plants on Eden&rsquo;s upper decks grow turn gnarled and feeble. Aziraphale looks the same, but Crowley is approaching 90 and the ship hasn&rsquo;t even landed on homestead yet.</p><p>and Azira hasn&rsquo;t thought about death in awhile. before Crowley, he&rsquo;s never had to. but now, sat next to a dying man who has been his whole world for the past 70 years or so, Aziraphale finds himself staring at it in the face as Crowley presses his cheek into Azira&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;where do androids go, when they die?&rdquo; Crowley asks in a near whisper.</p><p>Aziraphale cannot lie&ndash; it&rsquo;s the one thing he hasn&rsquo;t learned. Crowley had no need to lie to him. He says; &ldquo;a landfill, I suppose.&rdquo;</p><p>This makes his passenger chuckle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything to be in that landfill with you&ndash; you&rsquo;re all I have.&rdquo;</p><p>and that&rsquo;s the last thing he ever says</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>fast forward, 20 years later. the ship lands and those in the higher ups rush to hide the evidence of any malfunction, a mission they&rsquo;d been preparing for since word of Crowley&rsquo;s sleeping pod opening before its time was sent to HQ. if news like this gets out, people would never trust them again. so they purge everything.</p><p>part of the purge is the wiping of the memories of the bar android Aziraphale.</p><p>it isn&rsquo;t successful.</p><p>Aziraphale is stubborn, holding on to what he can. when they think they&rsquo;ve got every last bit, pieces of Crowley show up. weedle their way into his movements, into his tendency to reach for the sherry wine instead of anything else they have in store, into his tendency to call any one in front of him &ldquo;dearest&rdquo;, &ldquo;dear&rdquo;, and &ldquo;my love&rdquo;.</p><p>in the end, they disassemble him and tip him into a landfill.</p><p>in the end, Aziraphale disappears, just as Crowley did.</p><p>and no one finds out.</p>",
