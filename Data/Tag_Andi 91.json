(no offense, i do love my irl friends), but it\u2019s nice to have people understanding you and not judging you at all. they are even the kind of people that will always support you. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thegoodmantj:DkLTyDzTTbQNl0vLb6AiRw:ZcsHqv2g7cS6l\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49ccdfacdd47f1010095c55f0569cd0f/tumblr_pmmj3xnaZZ1rqhzp6o1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>as of right now, i\u2019m looking up to the whole andi mack cast. <b><i>they\u2019re such inspirational people. they remind me that i can do the same thing as them. they allow me to believe in myself. they inspire me to continue to be the better person than ever. </i></b></p><p><br/></p><p>andi mack is something that i would never forget for the rest of my life. <b><i>it\u2019s something that i would always cherish the most. </i></b></p><p><br/></p><p>it will always be one of those important and iconic shows to me. because they\u2019ve made the history. <i>they\u2019ve given so much that no one else did. this is something that young children should see while they\u2019re growing up. </i>i wish i could\u2019ve seen a show like this on disney channel when i was younger.</p><p><br/></p><p>so yeah, this is how important andi mack is to me. i\u2019m forever grateful for the whole andi mack cast to work hard and give us what we deserve. they deserve the endless appreciation. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"maclexa-bane:Ck3a66TLDTkWgde3Uf60wQ:ZwG3Mx2g6ueyI\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e7941fc4e74b96bd681525d4202dcb0/tumblr_pmlj8pE5p91qly9gho3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure>",

(this series is not chronological but they are connected. the part # refers to the order they were written.)</i><br/></p><p><i>this part features married!tyrus and some tooth-rotting fluff</i></p><p><i>(<a href=\"https://s0mersalty.tumblr.com/post/183751949080/conversations-i-an-education\">pt.1 on tumblr</a>)</i></p><p><i>\n\n<i>(<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18205901/chapters/43267799\">read on ao3</a>)</i>\n\n<br/></i></p><p>~~~</p><p>After putting away the too-generous leftovers that Cyrus\u2019 step-mom sent them home with, TJ walks into the bedroom to find his husband star-fished face-up on the bed. </p><p>\u201cEvery year I swear I\u2019m going to pace myself once we break fast, and every year I prove myself wrong and end up regretting it,\u201d Cyrus groans in misery. \u201cI just want to lay here like a beached whale. If you want me to move, you\u2019ll have to roll me yourself.\u201d</p><p>Distracted by his own thoughts, TJ gives a half-hearted smile as he gets ready for bed. It turns more genuine when Cyrus pouts and lifts his foot up, and TJ helps by pulling off his shoes and socks. \u201cC\u2019mon. At least go put on some pants with a little give. It\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus does so with a grumble, but TJ barely notices when he comes back to bed, until he gets a sharp, pointy finger in his side. </p><p>\u201cYou were quiet the whole way home. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm? Oh, yeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d TJ says, then resists the urge to squirm as patient brown eyes stare him down. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 Aunt Ruthie cornered me earlier.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Settling under the covers, Cyrus snorts. \u201cWhat, to push another plate of food on you? Consider yourself lucky that it wasn\u2019t Sharon and my mom ganging up on you, too. All I hear about whenever we go over to either of my parents\u2019 houses is how you don\u2019t eat enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, although I don\u2019t understand why they single me out.\u201d TJ gestures at his husband\u2019s long, lean frame. \u201cYou\u2019re way skinnier than me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugs. \u201cYeah, but they\u2019ve been feeding me for decades and it hasn\u2019t stuck. I think they\u2019ve all finally realized they\u2019re no match for my metabolism.\u201d With a frown, he props himself up on one elbow. \u201cSo if that wasn\u2019t it, what\u2019d Aunt Ruthie say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked when we were having kids.\u201d</p><p>After a lengthy silence, Cyrus quirks a brow. \u201cOkay&hellip; ? So, did you tell her the plan is to wait until you have your clinical license, and then we\u2019re going to try to adopt a couple older kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d TJ says, then hesitates and pivots on the bed to face him. \u201cThat is what you still want, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighs and rubs a hand over the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 she started talking about how being Jewish is not just about religion, it\u2019s an ethnicity, and about declining populations, and how important it is for the younger generation to secure the future of your people by having children, and\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It made me think.\u201d Biting his lip, he glances up into Cyrus\u2019 stunned face. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cyrus sits all the way up and clasps their hands together. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I think I\u2019m actually speechless. I didn\u2019t think that was possible.\u201d He shakes his head in bewilderment. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she went to you about this instead of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was planned,\u201d TJ says. \u201cShe seized the opportunity, I guess. But, you know, it\u2019s not really an option we ever discussed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, let\u2019s discuss.\u201d Running his fingers over TJ\u2019s wedding band, Cyrus looks down at their joined hands. \u201cYou\u2019re always so passionate about adoption; I\u2019m kind of stunned you\u2019d ever consider surrogacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d TJ shrugs. \u201cNow I kind of feel like a privileged jerk about it. I didn\u2019t even consider that having a biological child might be important to you; we\u2019ve talked about giving our kids the choice to be observant or not, and I thought that was enough.\u201d</p><p>With a frown, Cyrus tugs their hands between them to draw TJ\u2019s attention. \u201cI never thought about it myself until now, so don\u2019t beat yourself up. But\u2014and I hate to admit it\u2014I can kind of see Aunt Ruthie\u2019s point.\u201d He licks his lips and smiles a little. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve seen my baby pictures. Need I say more?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughs like he\u2019s supposed to, but it\u2019s fleeting. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you want? Surrogacy instead of adoption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not mutually exclusive, are they? C\u2019mere.\u201d Cyrus pulls him down until TJ\u2019s head is in his lap. \u201cWe can do one, or both, or neither. And we don\u2019t have to make the decision today.\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes as Cyrus\u2019 fingers card through his hair, TJ smiles genuinely for the first time that night. \u201cI guess not.

Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighs and rubs a hand over the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 she started talking about how being Jewish is not just about religion, it\u2019s an ethnicity, and about declining populations, and how important it is for the younger generation to secure the future of your people by having children, and\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It made me think.\u201d Biting his lip, he glances up into Cyrus\u2019 stunned face. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cyrus sits all the way up and clasps their hands together. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I think I\u2019m actually speechless.

I think they&rsquo;ve all finally realized they&rsquo;re no match for my metabolism.&rdquo; With a frown, he props himself up on one elbow. &ldquo;So if that wasn&rsquo;t it, what&rsquo;d Aunt Ruthie say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She asked when we were having kids.&rdquo;</p><p>After a lengthy silence, Cyrus quirks a brow. &ldquo;Okay&hellip; ? So, did you tell her the plan is to wait until you have your clinical license, and then we&rsquo;re going to try to adopt a couple older kids?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; TJ says, then hesitates and pivots on the bed to face him. &ldquo;That is what you still want, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, of course. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sighs and rubs a hand over the back of his neck. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; she started talking about how being Jewish is not just about religion, it&rsquo;s an ethnicity, and about declining populations, and how important it is for the younger generation to secure the future of your people by having children, and&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. It made me think.&rdquo; Biting his lip, he glances up into Cyrus&rsquo; stunned face. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Cyrus sits all the way up and clasps their hands together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I think I&rsquo;m actually speechless. I didn&rsquo;t think that was possible.&rdquo; He shakes his head in bewilderment. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe she went to you about this instead of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was planned,&rdquo; TJ says. &ldquo;She seized the opportunity, I guess. But, you know, it&rsquo;s not really an option we ever discussed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so, let&rsquo;s discuss.&rdquo; Running his fingers over TJ&rsquo;s wedding band, Cyrus looks down at their joined hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always so passionate about adoption; I&rsquo;m kind of stunned you&rsquo;d ever consider surrogacy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well.&rdquo; TJ shrugs. &ldquo;Now I kind of feel like a privileged jerk about it. I didn&rsquo;t even consider that having a biological child might be important to you; we&rsquo;ve talked about giving our kids the choice to be observant or not, and I thought that was enough.&rdquo;</p><p>With a frown, Cyrus tugs their hands between them to draw TJ&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;I never thought about it myself until now, so don&rsquo;t beat yourself up. But&mdash;and I hate to admit it&mdash;I can kind of see Aunt Ruthie&rsquo;s point.&rdquo; He licks his lips and smiles a little. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve seen my baby pictures. Need I say more?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughs like he&rsquo;s supposed to, but it&rsquo;s fleeting. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you want? Surrogacy instead of adoption?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not mutually exclusive, are they? C&rsquo;mere.&rdquo; Cyrus pulls him down until TJ&rsquo;s head is in his lap. &ldquo;We can do one, or both, or neither. And we don&rsquo;t have to make the decision today.&rdquo;</p><p>Closing his eyes as Cyrus&rsquo; fingers card through his hair, TJ smiles genuinely for the first time that night. &ldquo;I guess not. We&rsquo;ve got the rest of our lives to figure it out.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~</p><p>Cyrus holds the door open as TJ gingerly carries the carseat inside. He doesn&rsquo;t want to yell and announce their entrance, but it seems it&rsquo;s unnecessary since four pairs of eyes are suddenly glued to their every move, each set more excited than the last. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re home,&rdquo; he murmurs with a big grin. &ldquo;Boys, if you want to hold her, you have to sit down. You, too,&rdquo; he orders Andi and Buffy, the latter of which sticks her tongue out at him while Andi skips after his and TJ&rsquo;s two older children.</p><p>Three years ago, when Cyrus and TJ got serious about wanting to adopt, the plan had been to add to their family gradually, one kid at a time. And then they&rsquo;d met four-year-old twins Carter and Casey with their sweet dimpled faces and big brown eyes, and the rest was history. </p><p>Taking on two kids had been an interesting challenge&mdash;especially since they had been at an age where they were rowdy and curious, and old enough to act out on the pain and confusion caused by the drastic change in their living situation. </p><p>In the thick of the adjustment period, neither Cyrus nor TJ could fathom adding a third child into the mix. But then the boys had gotten older and more comfortable, and now they were going to school full-time, and the house had been a little too calm. So, much to Aunt Ruthie&rsquo;s delight, they&rsquo;d finally started searching for a Jewish egg donor.</p><p>TJ walks into the living room and sets the carrier down, grinning proudly as Andi and Buffy coo over the newborn. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s hands clean?&rdquo; he asks, unstrapping his daughter and tucking her close to his chest. When the boys nod from their seat on the couch, he steps forward. </p><p>Cyrus rushes over to help Casey into position first, and smiles as TJ gently settles the baby into one of her brothers&rsquo; arms. &ldquo;Boys, meet your sister, Abbi Rose.&rdquo;</p>",

If you want me to move, you&rsquo;ll have to roll me yourself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Distracted by his own thoughts, TJ gives a half-hearted smile as he gets ready for bed. It turns more genuine when Cyrus pouts and lifts his foot up, and TJ helps by pulling off his shoes and socks. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon. At least go put on some pants with a little give. It&rsquo;ll make you feel better.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus does so with a grumble, but TJ barely notices when he comes back to bed, until he gets a sharp, pointy finger in his side. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You were quiet the whole way home. Everything okay?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; TJ says, then resists the urge to squirm as patient brown eyes stare him down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; Aunt Ruthie cornered me earlier.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
