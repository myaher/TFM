He became a legend among the hero course rejects of Gen Ed. </li><li>Nemuri approached him in the middle of the year, saying he became kind of a legend, and asking him for tips on maximising her chances to transfer. </li><li>He tells her that relying just on her quirk is stupid and she should give herself more options. </li><li>Second year begins, and she\u2019s in the hero course. (If asked, Shouta will deny that he landed her all of his class notes so she can catch up). </li><li>Tensei was class representative. He was a cool guy, easy to talk with, and everyone liked him. </li><li>That\u2019s why everyone was surprised that he mainly hung out with the loud and excitable dork, trash bag transfer boy, and sass queen (though she was more understandable to them). </li><li>To be honest, they were also surprised about Tensei hanging out with them. </li><li>Tensei and Nemuri dated for a few months. They were the class\u2019 most popular couple. They broke up a few months later and stayed great friends. </li><li>Nemuri will NOT let Tensei forget it. </li><li>The only reason Tenya doesn\u2019t know about it from her is because Tensei threatened to show him pictures of her in high school. Not the good school pictures she got ready for. The really shitty pictures they took with horrible faces after three all-nighters in a row. </li><li>Speaking of Tenya, the group would babysit him a lot when they were in school. They did it less once they actually became pros , but Tenya still wonders why Aizawa sensei looked so familiar to him the first time he walked into class. </li><li>During the third year pairs of students are sent on patrols (not only in the internship program, but also as a school project, under their teachers and unrelated to outside work experience). Shouta patrolled with Hizashi, and Tensei patrolled with Nemuri. </li><li>Tensei has a gas mask installed in his suit so he can patrol with Nemuri and allow her to use her quirk affectivly. </li><li>Shouta and Hizashi patrolling together was the funniest thing ever cause Hizashi is all strolling down on the street, high fiving random civilians, and Shouta just,,, does parkour,,, trying to stay unseen,,, falling into a dumpster more times than he\u2019d like to admit when he didn\u2019t calculate the jump right,,,</li><li>Tensei (being the fastest) helped Shouta train on catching moving targets with his capture weapon. </li><li>When Tensei is in the hospital after the Stain incident, the entire team comes to visit him (usually separately). </li><li>Hizashi visits the least. Three-jobs-Yamada can\u2019t catch a break. He\u2019s an English teacher, a radio host, and a pro hero all at the same time. Even so, he calls whenever he can, sends little stuff with the others, and dedicates him songs on his radio show (they\u2019re either Tensei\u2019s favourites, songs that only mean something to their little group, songs they loved hating as teenagers or songs Tensei absolutely hates but Hizashi keeps trying to convince him to listen to). </li><li>Shouta\u2019s visits are almost always unofficial. He hardly ever makes it on visitation hours, but the patient (and his family) approves of those unconventional visits, and the overworked night shift staff likes him (he always has something to eat/drink in his sleeping bag and he would share it with anyone, be it the doctors or the maintenance staff, out of tired solidarity), so they can turn a blind eye. After all, underground heroes work very hard. </li><li>Nemuri is the only one whose visiting schedule is normal<strike> I swear to god that woman is the only adjusted adult among them</strike>. She always has a funny story to tell him about her students or about her fans. </li><li>All three of them keep him distracted and don\u2019t fuss too much around him. He appreciates it. His little brother looks so scared and heartbroken when he visits, and his mother is always worried. It\u2019s nice to catch a break and laugh at something silly with his friends. </li><li>When he\u2019s released, Tensei gets kinda bored. It\u2019s great to be back home and all, but there isn\u2019t much to do (especially with Tenya off at the dorms), and his parents won\u2019t stop treating him like he\u2019s fragile, both emotionally and physically. It really gets on his nerves, and he can\u2019t actually escape it. </li><li>He does have an awesome wheelchair, and he tweaked with it a little (with some more professional help from a certain support technician he met in his earlier years and whose daughter totally played Tenya in the sports festival) so now it can go really fucking fast. </li><li>Eventually he decides the best place for him to be, where he can still be helpful to society with his experience even without being an active hero, is U.A. He asks Nedzu for a job as a substitute teacher. </li><li>He gets the job, both because Yamada Hizashi SERIOUSLY looks like he would pass out/get caffeine poisoning if he doesn\u2019t get some rest, and because his experience is invaluable in this era of heroism. </li><li>His skills are so important because Ingenium was always known for his ability to cooperate with other heroes. He had dozens of sidekicks, and his team was always known for their ability to coordinate big scale operations together and work as a well oiled machine to ensure every case was solved in the fastest, cleanest way. They were also known to be able to cooperate very well with heroes they weren\u2019t as familiar with, and produce great results. This skill is what made him fit to also substitute for All Might, who with all his power never really needed to work with a team. He had one sidekick at a time, and they were practically the only people he worked with. When you\u2019re as powerful as All Might, you don\u2019t usually need to team up with others.</li><li>Obviously, he starts studying education at the same time so he can become a full time teacher (also so he can be a better teacher at the moment). </li><li>He keeps it as a surprise from Tenya. He wants to see the look on his face when he gets into class for the first time. </li><li>First time Tensei rolls into class, with a shit eating grin on his face, and says \u201chello class, my name is Iida Tensei, and I\u2019ll be your substitute teacher\u201d, Tenya almost loses it. Tensei isn\u2019t disappointed by the reaction. </li><li>The teacher\u2019s lounge is never quiet again. Ever. The old gang is back and they are even louder with Tensei there. They all do their jobs, and do them perfectly, but there\u2019s a lot more banter.</li><li>Cementoss really enjoys it. He was two years below them in school, and always kind of looked up to the four of them. </li></ul>",

                "content": "<p><h1>Random BNHA headcanons (1 - Aizawa, Yamada, Kayama and Iida, cause we don&rsquo;t talk about them enough)</h1><ul><li>Aizawa Shouta (Eraserhead), Yamada Hizashi (Present Mic), Kayama Nemuri (Midnight) and Iida Tensei (Ingenium) went to the same class in U.A (eventually)</li><li>Hizashi and Tensei got in through the entrance exam, obviously, but Nemuri and Shouta were transferred from Gen Ed. </li><li>Shouta won first place in his first year Sports Festival, and was transferred after the summer break. He became a legend among the hero course rejects of Gen Ed. </li><li>Nemuri approached him in the middle of the year, saying he became kind of a legend, and asking him for tips on maximising her chances to transfer. </li><li>He tells her that relying just on her quirk is stupid and she should give herself more options. </li><li>Second year begins, and she&rsquo;s in the hero course. (If asked, Shouta will deny that he landed her all of his class notes so she can catch up). </li><li>Tensei was class representative. He was a cool guy, easy to talk with, and everyone liked him. </li><li>That&rsquo;s why everyone was surprised that he mainly hung out with the loud and excitable dork, trash bag transfer boy, and sass queen (though she was more understandable to them). </li><li>To be honest, they were also surprised about Tensei hanging out with them. </li><li>Tensei and Nemuri dated for a few months. They were the class&rsquo; most popular couple. They broke up a few months later and stayed great friends. </li><li>Nemuri will NOT let Tensei forget it. </li><li>The only reason Tenya doesn&rsquo;t know about it from her is because Tensei threatened to show him pictures of her in high school. Not the good school pictures she got ready for. The really shitty pictures they took with horrible faces after three all-nighters in a row. </li><li>Speaking of Tenya, the group would babysit him a lot when they were in school. They did it less once they actually became pros , but Tenya still wonders why Aizawa sensei looked so familiar to him the first time he walked into class. </li><li>During the third year pairs of students are sent on patrols (not only in the internship program, but also as a school project, under their teachers and unrelated to outside work experience). Shouta patrolled with Hizashi, and Tensei patrolled with Nemuri. </li><li>Tensei has a gas mask installed in his suit so he can patrol with Nemuri and allow her to use her quirk affectivly. </li><li>Shouta and Hizashi patrolling together was the funniest thing ever cause Hizashi is all strolling down on the street, high fiving random civilians, and Shouta just,,, does parkour,,, trying to stay unseen,,, falling into a dumpster more times than he&rsquo;d like to admit when he didn&rsquo;t calculate the jump right,,,</li><li>Tensei (being the fastest) helped Shouta train on catching moving targets with his capture weapon. </li><li>When Tensei is in the hospital after the Stain incident, the entire team comes to visit him (usually separately). </li><li>Hizashi visits the least. Three-jobs-Yamada can&rsquo;t catch a break. He&rsquo;s an English teacher, a radio host, and a pro hero all at the same time. Even so, he calls whenever he can, sends little stuff with the others, and dedicates him songs on his radio show (they&rsquo;re either Tensei&rsquo;s favourites, songs that only mean something to their little group, songs they loved hating as teenagers or songs Tensei absolutely hates but Hizashi keeps trying to convince him to listen to). </li><li>Shouta&rsquo;s visits are almost always unofficial. He hardly ever makes it on visitation hours, but the patient (and his family) approves of those unconventional visits, and the overworked night shift staff likes him (he always has something to eat/drink in his sleeping bag and he would share it with anyone, be it the doctors or the maintenance staff, out of tired solidarity), so they can turn a blind eye. After all, underground heroes work very hard. </li><li>Nemuri is the only one whose visiting schedule is normal<strike> I swear to god that woman is the only adjusted adult among them</strike>. She always has a funny story to tell him about her students or about her fans. </li><li>All three of them keep him distracted and don&rsquo;t fuss too much around him. He appreciates it. His little brother looks so scared and heartbroken when he visits, and his mother is always worried. It&rsquo;s nice to catch a break and laugh at something silly with his friends. </li><li>When he&rsquo;s released, Tensei gets kinda bored. It&rsquo;s great to be back home and all, but there isn&rsquo;t much to do (especially with Tenya off at the dorms), and his parents won&rsquo;t stop treating him like he&rsquo;s fragile, both emotionally and physically.

I don\u2019t watch She-Ra, but I know a tasty trope when I see one!\u00a0</p><p>Of course they would get hit by a quirk, especially in the later half of the story when Mic\u2019s becoming more vigilante than villain, and of course both these idiots have a hero complex so they try to save each other. The villain\u2019s quirk probably forces one\u2019s body to shut down relieve their memories, but when two people get tagged at the same time, then they end up sharing a dream link that ends with both people seeing their own memories and the memories of another. Think how good a quirk that would\u2019ve been for couple\u2019s counseling!\u00a0</p><p>So now the two are in the hospital, which they\u2019re unaware of, and trapped in a black space where they can only find each other. They\u2019re not in their hero costumes, either. They\u2019re dressed as their truest expression of self - for Aizawa this would be comfortable black clothing with his binding cloth around his neck. After so many years of having that cloth next to him, you can\u2019t tell me that he doesn\u2019t wear that thing at home and forget it\u2019s there sometimes.\u00a0</p><p>Mic, though\u2026 Mic would be Yamada Hizashi. For Villain!Mic his truest expression would be clothes that are too big and too soft, clunky glasses that never seem to stay on right, a pair of headphones because <i>what if what if what if </i>and hair that\u2019s only just half pulled back - he needs to hide his hearing aids, after all. If Aizawa didn\u2019t know who his barista was by now, this helps him figure it out.\u00a0</p><p>After a very angst-filled conversation about cat muffins and\u00a0\u201c<i>You\u2019ve been in front of me this whole time?!\u201d </i>the two sees distant lights in the background and, well, might as well try to figure out where they are, right?</p><p>Cue the memories.
