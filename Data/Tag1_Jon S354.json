Come on,\u201d Robb pleads over the\nphone and Jon suppresses a sigh, eyeing his hotel couch and the book splayed on\nthe armrest longingly. \u201cMaybe a bit of pool, throw some darts\u2026 I can kick your\nass just like in high school, you know, for old time\u2019s sake.

He\u2019s the kind of guy who can convince anyone to do just\nabout anything; aka, the reason the two of them had gotten into so much trouble in high\nschool. </p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, but only a few drinks. <i>Promise</i> me it won\u2019t be like last time.\u201d </p><p>Last time they\u2019d ended up sleeping it off in the drunk tank\nat the local police station and Robb\u2019s dad, Ned Stark, had had to pick them up\nthe next morning.

I\u2019ll pick\nyour grumpy ass up at nine.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Winter Town, the only local bar that doesn\u2019t smell like\nvomit or play old country songs on repeat, is loud and dimly lit when Jon and\nRobb shoulder their way past a few older women who are laughing loudly between\nthemselves. </p><p>Jon looks around and immediately realizes what a terrible\nidea this is. He hasn\u2019t been home since graduating from Winterfell High three\nyears ago and he already feels like a stranger. He knows most of that is the\nmilitary. The Army has a habit of consuming you until your past doesn\u2019t even\nfeel like <i>your</i> past anymore. The Army\nbecomes everything; your family, your home, your wife, your mother, your father\u2026\nsometimes it\u2019s hard to exist outside of it. \u00a0Dressed in jeans and a loose black t-shirt and\nChuck Taylor\u2019s, he feels like an imposter. </p><p>Robb doesn\u2019t seem to notice his discomfort as he presses his\nway through the crowd and Jon shoves his hands in his pockets and follows\nafter. </p><p>The bar is crowded for it being barely nine o\u2019clock, and\nlaughter and the sound of pool balls clacking together ricochets over the music. </p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Gilly Tarly half squeals and launches herself at him.\nJon barely manages to catch her, surprised, and meets Sam\u2019s eye over his wife\u2019s\nhead. He shrugs as if to say what-can-you-do? and Jon gives her an awkward pat on\nthe back She steps away, beaming up at him. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so glad you came out, aren\u2019t we Sammy?\u201d she gushes,\ntaking her husband\u2019s arm in hers.They have two kids, which Jon has yet to meet but has seen plenty of pictures of. Sam is a very proud father, if the volume of pictures he texts Jon is anything to judge by. <br/></p><p>Sam extends his free hand, wide face flushed and stretched\ninto a broad smile. \u201cGood to see you, brother.\u201d Jon takes his hand and grasps\nit firmly, some of the tension leaking out of him. He smiles back and is\nsurprised to find that it doesn\u2019t feel forced. </p><p>He\u2019s missed these people, he realizes with a sudden sharp\npain in his chest, Sam especially. </p><p>He looks over Sam\u2019s shoulder and see\u2019s their friend Nedd,\nwho offers a slight wave, already nursing a pint. NedD elbows Theon, who is\nchecking out a group of college girls on the dance floor, and he turns and shoots Jon\na mock salute. Same old Theon, apparently. </p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Robb says, tossing his arm over Jon\u2019s shoulders, \u201cI\u2019ll\nget you a drink. Gotta treat America\u2019s finest, eh?</p><p>Jon elbows him lightly in the side and they all laugh as\nRobb falls against the bar, feigning a grievous wound. \u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d Robb declares with a scowl, and Jon\nsnorts into his beer. </p><p>Nedd pats him on the back. \u201cAll that target practice is\npaying off, apparently,\u201d he says with deep approval. Robb has always been a\nshit winner; made worse by the fact he\u2019d always beaten them at everything. </p><p>Jon leans back against a pool table and smiles, feeling more\nlike himself than he has in years. The beer is cheap and a bit warm but it\u2019s\noddly perfect, fitting even. He\u2019d forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a civilian,\nto live outside the confines of the Army. </p><p>\u201cBest of five?\u201d Robb pleads, pressing his hands together and\nsticking out his bottom lip. \u201cGive me a chance to win back some of my dignity?\u201d</p><p>Gilly giggles, feet dangling almost comically from a bar stool. \u201cNo\nchance of that!\u201d she says in a sing-song. <br/></p><p>Robb, busy throwing a foam coaster at Gilly, misses Theon\nnearly choking to death on a bit of popcorn he\u2019d snagged from behind the bar\nover something he sees across the room. </p><p>Sam slaps him on the back, and they both turn curiously. </p><p>Jon spots her immediately and blood rushes loudly in his\nears. </p><p>Her hair gleams like a beacon in the dim bar lights, bright\nred and artfully curled around her slim shoulders. Her pale skin is practically luminescent as she\nwades through the crowd, making everyone she passes seem almost dim by comparison. Men stare, wide eyed and opened mouthed as she passes and\nJon can\u2019t really blame them. </p><p>Sansa Stark has always been pretty, but now\u2026 now she\u2019s an\nhonest to god knock out. </p><p>Her dress is black and it\u2019s tight around her chest and waist\nbefore flaring out at her hips. It falls mid-thigh, leaving a great deal of\npale skin exposed, bright red heels accentuating trim calves and neat ankles. He\u2019s certain he\u2019s never seen anything or anyone more beautiful in his life. <br/></p><p>Distantly, Jon hears Robb make a choking noise, having\nfinally realized what everyone is looking at. Sansa\u2019s eyes, accentuated by a\ntouch of makeup, flick across the room, jumping from face to face, before finding his\nand settling there, as if he\u2019s the person she\u2019d been looking for all along.\nWhich is completely insane. Sansa had barely spared him a glance when they\u2019d\nbeen in school together. </p><p>She smiles at him, perfect white teeth flashing against red\npainted lips and it warms Jon down to his toes. </p><p><i>Jesus Christ</i>, he\nthinks distantly, fingers tightening around his beer mug. </p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Sansa!\u201d Robb half bellows for an entirely\ndifferent reason as he pushes past Jon to intercept her. \u201cWhat are you doing\nhere?!\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s gaze leaves his and Jon can finally draw in a full\nbreath. He feels like he might have been struck by lightning or hit by a\nbus maybe. Sansa is pursing her lips and frowning at Robb, her eyes icy cold. \u201cI\u2019m here to\nspend time with friends and see Jon, since you conveniently didn\u2019t invite me.\u201d</p><p>Robb takes her by the arm and presses her in front of him,\nsteering her toward where their small group has claimed a corner, tossing\nfurious glares at the ogling men in the bar as he goes. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not twenty-one,\u201d he hisses at her and she rolls her\neyes, shrugging him off. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be twenty-one to go into a bar, <i>Robbie</i>,\u201d she says with mock sweetness. \u201cJust\neighteen, which, if you weren\u2019t aware, I turned three weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dart to Jon when she says this for some reason and\nJon refuses to consider the implications. He\u2019s still trying to get his brain to\nfunction on all cylinders, and her full, red lips are not helping. The last time he\u2019d seen Sansa she\u2019d been fifteen,\ndressed in sweatpants and a baggy sweater, eating ice cream out of a tub on the\ncouch while she and Margery Tyrell watched some romantic comedy. He hadn\u2019t paid\nher much attention then; she;d just been his best friend\u2019s kid sister. He\u2019s\nstarting to think that might have been a huge mistake. </p><p>Robb sputters, color high in his cheeks. \u201cYeah but you \u2013your\ndress\u2026 if mom knew she\u2019d-\u201c</p><p>Sansa pinches him on the arm and he yelps. Jon has to hide\nhis laugh behind a cough as Robb shoots him a glare. \u201cWho\u2019s shoes do you think\nthese are, Robb? Now stop being such a fucking prude, okay?\u201d</p><p>Robb deflates, but not before shooting Jon a pleading look.\nHe throws up one hand and buries his face in his beer mug, praying his expression\ndoesn\u2019t show every single one of his less-than-brotherly thoughts. She\u2019s like a\nwalking temptation. Christ, he can smell her perfume from here; something warm and sweet that makes his toes curl in his boots. He wonders, before he can help it, if she\u2019d taste as good as she smells. <br/></p><p>Theon has no reservations. \u201cDamn, Sans, you look <i>hot,</i>\u201d he declares, obviously more than a little\ndrunk, and steps toward her. Jon doesn\u2019t have to look to know there is\nmurder in Robb\u2019s eyes. Jon feels a bit violent himself. \u201cWanna\ndance?\u201d Theon asks, clearly not worried about his well being, and crowds in on her. Jon still doesn\u2019t look up, figuring Sansa can dance with whoever the hell she wants to dance with, even if the idea gives him something akin to heart burn. <br/></p><p>Bright red shoes enter his line of sight and he lifts his head in surprise. She\u2019s even more stunning up close; blue eyes gleaming with\nsomething dangerous and heady as she studies him. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d she replies huskily, her\ngaze never leaving Jon\u2019s face, \u201cThere\u2019s someone else I\u2019ve been hoping to dance with.\u201d</p>",

He\u2019s certain he\u2019s never seen anything or anyone more beautiful in his life. <br></p><p>Distantly, Jon hears Robb make a choking noise, having\nfinally realized what everyone is looking at. Sansa\u2019s eyes, accentuated by a\ntouch of makeup, flick across the room, jumping from face to face, before finding his\nand settling there, as if he\u2019s the person she\u2019d been looking for all along.\nWhich is completely insane. Sansa had barely spared him a glance when they\u2019d\nbeen in school together. </p><p>She smiles at him, perfect white teeth flashing against red\npainted lips and it warms Jon down to his toes. </p><p><i>Jesus Christ</i>, he\nthinks distantly, fingers tightening around his beer mug. </p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Sansa!\u201d Robb half bellows for an entirely\ndifferent reason as he pushes past Jon to intercept her. \u201cWhat are you doing\nhere?!\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s gaze leaves his and Jon can finally draw in a full\nbreath. He feels like he might have been struck by lightning or hit by a\nbus maybe. Sansa is pursing her lips and frowning at Robb, her eyes icy cold. \u201cI\u2019m here to\nspend time with friends and see Jon, since you conveniently didn\u2019t invite me.\u201d</p><p>Robb takes her by the arm and presses her in front of him,\nsteering her toward where their small group has claimed a corner, tossing\nfurious glares at the ogling men in the bar as he goes. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not twenty-one,\u201d he hisses at her and she rolls her\neyes, shrugging him off. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be twenty-one to go into a bar, <i>Robbie</i>,\u201d she says with mock sweetness. \u201cJust\neighteen, which, if you weren\u2019t aware, I turned three weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dart to Jon when she says this for some reason and\nJon refuses to consider the implications. He\u2019s still trying to get his brain to\nfunction on all cylinders, and her full, red lips are not helping. The last time he\u2019d seen Sansa she\u2019d been fifteen,\ndressed in sweatpants and a baggy sweater, eating ice cream out of a tub on the\ncouch while she and Margery Tyrell watched some romantic comedy. He hadn\u2019t paid\nher much attention then; she;d just been his best friend\u2019s kid sister. He\u2019s\nstarting to think that might have been a huge mistake. </p><p>Robb sputters, color high in his cheeks. \u201cYeah but you \u2013your\ndress\u2026 if mom knew she\u2019d-\u201c</p><p>Sansa pinches him on the arm and he yelps. Jon has to hide\nhis laugh behind a cough as Robb shoots him a glare. \u201cWho\u2019s shoes do you think\nthese are, Robb? Now stop being such a fucking prude, okay?\u201d</p><p>Robb deflates, but not before shooting Jon a pleading look.\nHe throws up one hand and buries his face in his beer mug, praying his expression\ndoesn\u2019t show every single one of his less-than-brotherly thoughts. She\u2019s like a\nwalking temptation. Christ, he can smell her perfume from here; something warm and sweet that makes his toes curl in his boots. He wonders, before he can help it, if she\u2019d taste as good as she smells. <br></p><p>Theon has no reservations. \u201cDamn, Sans, you look <i>hot,</i>\u201d he declares, obviously more than a little\ndrunk, and steps toward her. Jon doesn\u2019t have to look to know there is\nmurder in Robb\u2019s eyes. Jon feels a bit violent himself. \u201cWanna\ndance?\u201d Theon asks, clearly not worried about his well being, and crowds in on her. Jon still doesn\u2019t look up, figuring Sansa can dance with whoever the hell she wants to dance with, even if the idea gives him something akin to heart burn. <br></p><p>Bright red shoes enter his line of sight and he lifts his head in surprise. She\u2019s even more stunning up close; blue eyes gleaming with\nsomething dangerous and heady as she studies him. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d she replies huskily, her\ngaze never leaving Jon\u2019s face, \u201cThere\u2019s someone else I\u2019ve been hoping to dance with.\u201d</p>",

Sansa had barely spared him a glance when they&rsquo;d\nbeen in school together. </p><p>She smiles at him, perfect white teeth flashing against red\npainted lips and it warms Jon down to his toes. </p><p><i>Jesus Christ</i>, he\nthinks distantly, fingers tightening around his beer mug. </p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ, Sansa!&rdquo; Robb half bellows for an entirely\ndifferent reason as he pushes past Jon to intercept her. &ldquo;What are you doing\nhere?!&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s gaze leaves his and Jon can finally draw in a full\nbreath. He feels like he might have been struck by lightning or hit by a\nbus maybe. Sansa is pursing her lips and frowning at Robb, her eyes icy cold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to\nspend time with friends and see Jon, since you conveniently didn&rsquo;t invite me.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb takes her by the arm and presses her in front of him,\nsteering her toward where their small group has claimed a corner, tossing\nfurious glares at the ogling men in the bar as he goes. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not twenty-one,&rdquo; he hisses at her and she rolls her\neyes, shrugging him off. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be twenty-one to go into a bar, <i>Robbie</i>,&rdquo; she says with mock sweetness. &ldquo;Just\neighteen, which, if you weren&rsquo;t aware, I turned three weeks ago.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes dart to Jon when she says this for some reason and\nJon refuses to consider the implications. He&rsquo;s still trying to get his brain to\nfunction on all cylinders, and her full, red lips are not helping. The last time he&rsquo;d seen Sansa she&rsquo;d been fifteen,\ndressed in sweatpants and a baggy sweater, eating ice cream out of a tub on the\ncouch while she and Margery Tyrell watched some romantic comedy. He hadn&rsquo;t paid\nher much attention then; she;d just been his best friend&rsquo;s kid sister. He&rsquo;s\nstarting to think that might have been a huge mistake. </p><p>Robb sputters, color high in his cheeks. &ldquo;Yeah but you &ndash;your\ndress&hellip; if mom knew she&rsquo;d-&ldquo;</p><p>Sansa pinches him on the arm and he yelps. Jon has to hide\nhis laugh behind a cough as Robb shoots him a glare. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s shoes do you think\nthese are, Robb? Now stop being such a fucking prude, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Robb deflates, but not before shooting Jon a pleading look.\nHe throws up one hand and buries his face in his beer mug, praying his expression\ndoesn&rsquo;t show every single one of his less-than-brotherly thoughts. She&rsquo;s like a\nwalking temptation. Christ, he can smell her perfume from here; something warm and sweet that makes his toes curl in his boots. He wonders, before he can help it, if she&rsquo;d taste as good as she smells. <br /></p><p>Theon has no reservations. &ldquo;Damn, Sans, you look <i>hot,</i>&rdquo; he declares, obviously more than a little\ndrunk, and steps toward her. Jon doesn&rsquo;t have to look to know there is\nmurder in Robb&rsquo;s eyes. Jon feels a bit violent himself. &ldquo;Wanna\ndance?&rdquo; Theon asks, clearly not worried about his well being, and crowds in on her. Jon still doesn&rsquo;t look up, figuring Sansa can dance with whoever the hell she wants to dance with, even if the idea gives him something akin to heart burn. <br /></p><p>Bright red shoes enter his line of sight and he lifts his head in surprise. She&rsquo;s even more stunning up close; blue eyes gleaming with\nsomething dangerous and heady as she studies him. &ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; she replies huskily, her\ngaze never leaving Jon&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone else I&rsquo;ve been hoping to dance with.&rdquo;</p>",

They manage to defeat Euron at the same time, but keep getting pushed farther and farther south by NK. In order to save everyone from NK, they are forced to flee to Kings Landing, which means they must fight Cersei. They win in an epic battle that destroys Kings Landing. But then, Dany has the baby early and they have a daughter that survived birth despite being a premie. Then just as Westeros begins to completely fall to NK, Jon and Dany are convinced by Sam and Melisandre that Jon is Azor Ahai. But in order to fulfill the prophecy, it turns out that Jon doesn&rsquo;t have to kill Dany, but has to kill his baby daughter instead. Thus breaking apart Dany and Jon&rsquo;s alliance and turning them against each other, until it&rsquo;s realized that if Jon doesn&rsquo;t fulfill the prophecy no one will survive the NK anywhere in the world because Euron&rsquo;s ships and dead were abaorbed into the WW army. So to save the world, Jon kills his baby daughter to fulfill the prophecy and defeat NK, but in the process of eliminating the WW, he dies himself and Dany is left to pick up the ruins of Westeros alone while going mad with grief. Thus Tyrion and Varys are forced to kill her and place Gendry on the throne. </p><p>Or even worse, Jon must kill Dany while she is pregnant&hellip;. </p><p>These two theories I have in my head fit the lines of GoT with &ldquo;everybody dies in the most horrible ways you would never think of.&rdquo; While continuing to shock us all with the death of the innocent love-child&hellip; </p><p>Someone please tell me this is far fetched and won&rsquo;t happen! </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"398\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thatonekimgirl:aYfIHH4LtOifxQntSWMKUw:ZjCbLy2Ov3Z3C\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a34af04f5ca852c7c638f6738459a05/tumblr_ounvnh3TVM1qbbotio2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"398\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>I don&rsquo;t want to see Jon and Dany torn apart!
