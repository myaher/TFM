The child who spoke with Varys in 8x05, where did she go?)</p><p>*</p><p>Even in the north the ash seems to follow him as a punishment. He feels and sees it everywhere. Under the nostrils. In the snowflakes that falls from the leaden sky. In dark woolen clothes. In the wary awareness with which the lords observe him. In the impassive gaze of Arya when, raising her head from the sword resting sideways on her legs, she peers at him with young and old eyes at the same time.</p><p>He arrived a fortnight ago, silent like a ghost. Since then he has walked around the castle feeling an intruder. (When he is in the South, he longs for the North, but even here now he feels out of place. Broken. What is his place? He doesn&rsquo;t know anymore. He doesn&rsquo;t know if he wants to find out.)</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t kill her, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; she says and goes back to sharpening Needle.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya,&rdquo; he pronounces her name with a heavy weariness that reaches his bones, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not so easy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is. Killing is easy. Choose to do it isn&rsquo;t. She hates Sansa, you know it. She will be the next on her list.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon flinches while the words sink inside him. A body incinerated and unrecognizable except for copper hair. The horror and despair of that image strike him ruthless and\u00a0back-stabbing. He feels the taste of ash in his mouth again and the smoke and the fire replace the familiar smell of snow. He runs a hand over his face.</p><p><i>Whose fault is it? </i>The thought is bitter, horrible. However also true in part.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa can have her faults,&rdquo; she replies, as if she had read his mind, (and this new ability of Arya to see through expressions and guess the thoughts behind the silences is frightening), &ldquo;but she doesn&rsquo;t deserve to die. She loves the North. She will not let anyone else die for it.&rdquo;</p><p>She loves the North, she said. The way she looked at him, though, as if she knew a secret, as if she were not referring to the North at all, not only at least. There is a question, simple and fast and he is about to formulate it. However, it isn&rsquo;t Arya who should be asked.</p><p>He shakes his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t kill her,&rdquo; he whispers, words like boulders in his throat. &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you love her.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon laughs, a dark and hostile laugh. &ldquo;Not in the way you believe.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s eyes are unblinking. &ldquo;In what way then?&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p><p><i>Not in the way of wolves, but of dragons</i>.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;You really had to, didn&rsquo;t you? To antagonize her. To provoke her. You couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa gives him the back. She must have heard him come in, but she didn&rsquo;t turn around. She is standing in front of the map of the seven kingdoms, surrounded by a myriad of missives and dispatches. Her hand hesitates nervously around a scroll. Whatever the content, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be appreciated.</p><p>&ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; she says, not an order, not a plea, but something halfway between defeat and empty victory. Her back usually straight as a spindle is curved. That and the fact that he can&rsquo;t see her face sting, screaming to his conscience of her altered countenance, the absence of the bold confidence that she always shows like an armor and above all the strangeness\u00a0of feeling so close and yet so far.</p><p>&ldquo;You swore to never tell. You broke an oath. That doesn&rsquo;t make you better than a Lannister. Why did you tell Tyrion?&rdquo;</p><p>When she turns, he feels like he&rsquo;s been hit in the chest. Insomnia stains her eye sockets like soot. And her gaze, gods her eyes, chains itself to his and seems not to want to let him go.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you deserve a choice,&rdquo; she responds forcefully, quiet determination even in her raw desperation. &ldquo;The freedom not to hide what you are. You could rewrite your parents&rsquo; story. You could rewrite your story. Or you might not do it. But the choice is yours. It belongs to you and nobody else.&rdquo;</p><p>Where was his choice when she decided to confide in Tyrion? How is it possible that she doesn&rsquo;t understand? Everything he did, every step, every word, every gesture. All made more difficult by her, who worked against him all the time. &ldquo;What do you think will happen now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can imagine it. She will have me executed.&rdquo; The small and sad smile she gives him is a stab. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m lucky, you might be able to intercede for a quick death. I&rsquo;d rather die like Father, by sword and not fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will not die,&rdquo; he discovers himself saying and without realizing it he walks the few steps that separate them. He would like to shake her to wipe the desolate expression from her face, rub from her mouth the bitterness and disregard with witch she talks about her own death. Perhaps this is what drives him more, not the absence of a reaction, but the fact that even now she isn&rsquo;t completely sincere, she doesn&rsquo;t show him the tears that surely she must have cried alone, she refuses to lean on him, perhaps thinking to be a burden. </p><p><i>Stupid, stupid woman,</i> he thinks. The desire to touch her is a physical, vital need. He grabs her by the arms and pulls her to him and through the dress he feels the tremor that shakes her.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she whispers, clawing at his jerkin and it&rsquo;s finally Sansa talking and breathing, a creature of blood and cracks. Not the Lady of Winterfell, icy and unreachable, courteous even in the face of her own executioner. It is Sansa who passes her arms behind his back and buries her face against his chest while he does the same, rubbing his nose in her neck, under the lobe of her ear.</p><p>He hears her sigh, a tremulous sigh that suggests how stubbornly she refused to rest in the last few months, throwing herself headlong into the role of regent, protector, warrior.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think we will allow it?&rdquo; He remembers Arya, the deadly look that promises death. Bran and his words. Let the king be born.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill her,&rdquo; he hears her say. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p><p>It is true and this sharpens the torment he feels. He has loved three women in his life. The first died in his arms and helped him kill the boy, let the man be born. The second was an impossible love from which he fled until he managed to resist, familiar and full of temptations. He loved the third as long as he could, a love of war, of fire and blood, but that didn&rsquo;t give any peace at all.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s this woman, the woman who he shouldn&rsquo;t desire as he desires, the woman he promised to protect, the woman who gave him a purpose in a life he didn&rsquo;t want, a second chance for redemption. This woman who once was his sister and who is now family. It&rsquo;s Sansa that he wants, that he has chosen.</p><p>If the war failed to do so, it will be the attempts to protect each other that will eventually destroy them.</p><p>He touches her forehead with his lips, then her eyebrows, her nose, her cheeks. At a whisker from her mouth, he looks at her half-lidded eyelids. &ldquo;So I should watch while she kills you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish you weren&rsquo;t forced to choose. It&rsquo;s not fair, but the world rarely is.&rdquo; She puts her hand against his jaw. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry. I played my cards and lost. I proved I was right about everything, but what does it matter to be right? I have few regrets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Children. I would have liked to have some. Dark hair and grey-eyed like you, Arya and Father. Redheaded and blue eyes like Mother, Robb and Rickon.&rdquo;</p><p>He can imagine them and it&rsquo;s this new wish, the awful agony\u00a0of her wrenching expression that makes him say, &ldquo;You can still have them if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>She shakes her head and the tears in her eyes breaks his heart.</p><p>*</p><p><i>Where did we get lost?

The child who spoke with Varys in 8x05, where did she go?)</p><p>*</p><p>Even in the north the ash seems to follow him as a punishment. He feels and sees it everywhere. Under the nostrils. In the snowflakes that falls from the leaden sky. In dark woolen clothes. In the wary awareness with which the lords observe him. In the impassive gaze of Arya when, raising her head from the sword resting sideways on her legs, she peers at him with young and old eyes at the same time.</p><p>He arrived a fortnight ago, silent like a ghost. Since then he has walked around the castle feeling an intruder. (When he is in the South, he longs for the North, but even here now he feels out of place. Broken. What is his place? He doesn\u2019t know anymore. He doesn\u2019t know if he wants to find out.)</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t kill her, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d she says and goes back to sharpening Needle.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d he pronounces her name with a heavy weariness that reaches his bones, \u201cit\u2019s not so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Killing is easy. Choose to do it isn\u2019t. She hates Sansa, you know it. She will be the next on her list.\u201d</p><p>Jon flinches while the words sink inside him. A body incinerated and unrecognizable except for copper hair. The horror and despair of that image strike him ruthless and\u00a0back-stabbing. He feels the taste of ash in his mouth again and the smoke and the fire replace the familiar smell of snow. He runs a hand over his face.</p><p><i>Whose fault is it? </i>The thought is bitter, horrible. However also true in part.</p><p>\u201cSansa can have her faults,\u201d she replies, as if she had read his mind, (and this new ability of Arya to see through expressions and guess the thoughts behind the silences is frightening), \u201cbut she doesn\u2019t deserve to die. She loves the North. She will not let anyone else die for it.\u201d</p><p>She loves the North, she said. The way she looked at him, though, as if she knew a secret, as if she were not referring to the North at all, not only at least. There is a question, simple and fast and he is about to formulate it. However, it isn\u2019t Arya who should be asked.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t kill her,\u201d he whispers, words like boulders in his throat. \u201cI cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you love her.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughs, a dark and hostile laugh. \u201cNot in the way you believe.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes are unblinking. \u201cIn what way then?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p><i>Not in the way of wolves, but of dragons</i>.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou really had to, didn\u2019t you? To antagonize her. To provoke her. You couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Sansa gives him the back. She must have heard him come in, but she didn\u2019t turn around. She is standing in front of the map of the seven kingdoms, surrounded by a myriad of missives and dispatches. Her hand hesitates nervously around a scroll. Whatever the content, it doesn\u2019t have to be appreciated.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d she says, not an order, not a plea, but something halfway between defeat and empty victory. Her back usually straight as a spindle is curved. That and the fact that he can\u2019t see her face sting, screaming to his conscience of her altered countenance, the absence of the bold confidence that she always shows like an armor and above all the strangeness\u00a0of feeling so close and yet so far.</p><p>\u201cYou swore to never tell. You broke an oath. That doesn\u2019t make you better than a Lannister. Why did you tell Tyrion?\u201d</p><p>When she turns, he feels like he\u2019s been hit in the chest. Insomnia stains her eye sockets like soot. And her gaze, gods her eyes, chains itself to his and seems not to want to let him go.</p><p>\u201cBecause you deserve a choice,\u201d she responds forcefully, quiet determination even in her raw desperation. \u201cThe freedom not to hide what you are. You could rewrite your parents\u2019 story. You could rewrite your story. Or you might not do it. But the choice is yours. It belongs to you and nobody else.\u201d</p><p>Where was his choice when she decided to confide in Tyrion? How is it possible that she doesn\u2019t understand? Everything he did, every step, every word, every gesture. All made more difficult by her, who worked against him all the time. \u201cWhat do you think will happen now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine it. She will have me executed.\u201d The small and sad smile she gives him is a stab. \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky, you might be able to intercede for a quick death. I\u2019d rather die like Father, by sword and not fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not die,\u201d he discovers himself saying and without realizing it he walks the few steps that separate them. He would like to shake her to wipe the desolate expression from her face, rub from her mouth the bitterness and disregard with witch she talks about her own death. Perhaps this is what drives him more, not the absence of a reaction, but the fact that even now she isn\u2019t completely sincere, she doesn\u2019t show him the tears that surely she must have cried alone, she refuses to lean on him, perhaps thinking to be a burden. </p><p><i>Stupid, stupid woman,</i> he thinks. The desire to touch her is a physical, vital need. He grabs her by the arms and pulls her to him and through the dress he feels the tremor that shakes her.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she whispers, clawing at his jerkin and it\u2019s finally Sansa talking and breathing, a creature of blood and cracks. Not the Lady of Winterfell, icy and unreachable, courteous even in the face of her own executioner. It is Sansa who passes her arms behind his back and buries her face against his chest while he does the same, rubbing his nose in her neck, under the lobe of her ear.</p><p>He hears her sigh, a tremulous sigh that suggests how stubbornly she refused to rest in the last few months, throwing herself headlong into the role of regent, protector, warrior.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we will allow it?\u201d He remembers Arya, the deadly look that promises death. Bran and his words. Let the king be born.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill her,\u201d he hears her say. \u201cYou don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>It is true and this sharpens the torment he feels. He has loved three women in his life. The first died in his arms and helped him kill the boy, let the man be born. The second was an impossible love from which he fled until he managed to resist, familiar and full of temptations. He loved the third as long as he could, a love of war, of fire and blood, but that didn\u2019t give any peace at all.</p><p>But it\u2019s this woman, the woman who he shouldn\u2019t desire as he desires, the woman he promised to protect, the woman who gave him a purpose in a life he didn\u2019t want, a second chance for redemption. This woman who once was his sister and who is now family. It\u2019s Sansa that he wants, that he has chosen.</p><p>If the war failed to do so, it will be the attempts to protect each other that will eventually destroy them.</p><p>He touches her forehead with his lips, then her eyebrows, her nose, her cheeks. At a whisker from her mouth, he looks at her half-lidded eyelids. \u201cSo I should watch while she kills you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you weren\u2019t forced to choose. It\u2019s not fair, but the world rarely is.\u201d She puts her hand against his jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I played my cards and lost. I proved I was right about everything, but what does it matter to be right? I have few regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cChildren. I would have liked to have some. Dark hair and grey-eyed like you, Arya and Father. Redheaded and blue eyes like Mother, Robb and Rickon.\u201d</p><p>He can imagine them and it\u2019s this new wish, the awful agony\u00a0of her wrenching expression that makes him say, \u201cYou can still have them if you want.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and the tears in her eyes breaks his heart.</p><p>*</p><p><i>Where did we get lost? There was a moment when we walked along the same path and we were so close that I could touch your hand.</i></p><p><i>Around us the roaring sound of thunderous applause, the silence of triumph, the smell of home.

I proved I was right about everything, but what does it matter to be right? I have few regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cChildren. I would have liked to have some. Dark hair and grey-eyed like you, Arya and Father. Redheaded and blue eyes like Mother, Robb and Rickon.\u201d</p><p>He can imagine them and it\u2019s this new wish, the awful agony\u00a0of her wrenching expression that makes him say, \u201cYou can still have them if you want.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and the tears in her eyes breaks his heart.</p><p>*</p><p><i>Where did we get lost? There was a moment when we walked along the same path and we were so close that I could touch your hand.</i></p><p><i>Around us the roaring sound of thunderous applause, the silence of triumph, the smell of home.

It no longer matters. The north is yours, my lord. Keep looking at it for me.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cThe greatest danger is the dragon.

Drogon lies dead behind the throne. He died, killed by his sword, not before he melted the iron throne. Now his head lies ten feet away from them, in a pool of blood. In that same puddle, he finds himself, in his arms the increasingly cold and pale body of Daenerys.</p><p>This time there is no arrow planted in her chest.</p><p>Poison, Arya said when she saw her coughing up blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dying,\u201d he reassures her, lying. He puts his hand on her cheek and without turning, he barks to his right, \u201cFind a Maester!\u201d</p><p>With the same delicacy of the first time, he dries another trickle of blood. Her lips are red. \u201cYou will be fine. The wound is not deep. You will heal.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and in her eyes the crazy light is finally relegated. She is excatly like the first time he\u2019s seen her. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re not very good at it. You\u2019re a worthless liar. I don\u2019t know how I managed not to notice it before.\u201d</p><p>He swallows. \u201cI -\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be a good king.\u201d</p><p>This is the last thing he wants to hear right now. \u201cI don\u2019t want that goddamned throne,\u201d he says and feels like he hasn\u2019t said anything else in the last few months.</p><p>With the few strengths left, she raises her hand to rest it against his cheek. He grabs it, keeping it in place. \u201cAnd despite this, now it\u2019s yours. It can\u2019t be avoided. This is your destiny, as it was for me. Now you will understand what it feels like to be the last Targaryen.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>This fear&rsquo;s got a hold on me</b></p><p>(8x06 speculation. The child who spoke with Varys in 8x05, where did she go?)</p><p>*</p><p>Even in the north the ash seems to follow him as a punishment. He feels and sees it everywhere. Under the nostrils. In the snowflakes that falls from the leaden sky. In dark woolen clothes. In the wary awareness with which the lords observe him. In the impassive gaze of Arya when, raising her head from the sword resting sideways on her legs, she peers at him with young and old eyes at the same time.</p><p>He arrived a fortnight ago, silent like a ghost. Since then he has walked around the castle feeling an intruder. (When he is in the South, he longs for the North, but even here now he feels out of place. Broken. What is his place? He doesn&rsquo;t know anymore. He doesn&rsquo;t know if he wants to find out.)</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t kill her, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; she says and goes back to sharpening Needle.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya,&rdquo; he pronounces her name with a heavy weariness that reaches his bones, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not so easy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is. Killing is easy. Choose to do it isn&rsquo;t. She hates Sansa, you know it. She will be the next on her list.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon flinches while the words sink inside him. A body incinerated and unrecognizable except for copper hair. The horror and despair of that image strike him ruthless and&nbsp;back-stabbing. He feels the taste of ash in his mouth again and the smoke and the fire replace the familiar smell of snow. He runs a hand over his face.</p><p><i>Whose fault is it? </i>The thought is bitter, horrible. However also true in part.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa can have her faults,&rdquo; she replies, as if she had read his mind, (and this new ability of Arya to see through expressions and guess the thoughts behind the silences is frightening), &ldquo;but she doesn&rsquo;t deserve to die. She loves the North. She will not let anyone else die for it.&rdquo;</p><p>She loves the North, she said. The way she looked at him, though, as if she knew a secret, as if she were not referring to the North at all, not only at least. There is a question, simple and fast and he is about to formulate it. However, it isn&rsquo;t Arya who should be asked.</p><p>He shakes his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t kill her,&rdquo; he whispers, words like boulders in his throat. &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you love her.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon laughs, a dark and hostile laugh. &ldquo;Not in the way you believe.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s eyes are unblinking. &ldquo;In what way then?&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p><p><i>Not in the way of wolves, but of dragons</i>.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;You really had to, didn&rsquo;t you? To antagonize her. To provoke her. You couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa gives him the back. She must have heard him come in, but she didn&rsquo;t turn around. She is standing in front of the map of the seven kingdoms, surrounded by a myriad of missives and dispatches. Her hand hesitates nervously around a scroll. Whatever the content, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be appreciated.</p><p>&ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; she says, not an order, not a plea, but something halfway between defeat and empty victory. Her back usually straight as a spindle is curved. That and the fact that he can&rsquo;t see her face sting, screaming to his conscience of her altered countenance, the absence of the bold confidence that she always shows like an armor and above all the strangeness&nbsp;of feeling so close and yet so far.</p><p>&ldquo;You swore to never tell. You broke an oath. That doesn&rsquo;t make you better than a Lannister. Why did you tell Tyrion?&rdquo;</p><p>When she turns, he feels like he&rsquo;s been hit in the chest. Insomnia stains her eye sockets like soot. And her gaze, gods her eyes, chains itself to his and seems not to want to let him go.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you deserve a choice,&rdquo; she responds forcefully, quiet determination even in her raw desperation. &ldquo;The freedom not to hide what you are. You could rewrite your parents&rsquo; story. You could rewrite your story. Or you might not do it. But the choice is yours. It belongs to you and nobody else.&rdquo;</p><p>Where was his choice when she decided to confide in Tyrion? How is it possible that she doesn&rsquo;t understand? Everything he did, every step, every word, every gesture. All made more difficult by her, who worked against him all the time. &ldquo;What do you think will happen now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can imagine it. She will have me executed.&rdquo; The small and sad smile she gives him is a stab. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m lucky, you might be able to intercede for a quick death. I&rsquo;d rather die like Father, by sword and not fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will not die,&rdquo; he discovers himself saying and without realizing it he walks the few steps that separate them. He would like to shake her to wipe the desolate expression from her face, rub from her mouth the bitterness and disregard with witch she talks about her own death. Perhaps this is what drives him more, not the absence of a reaction, but the fact that even now she isn&rsquo;t completely sincere, she doesn&rsquo;t show him the tears that surely she must have cried alone, she refuses to lean on him, perhaps thinking to be a burden. </p><p><i>Stupid, stupid woman,</i> he thinks. The desire to touch her is a physical, vital need. He grabs her by the arms and pulls her to him and through the dress he feels the tremor that shakes her.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she whispers, clawing at his jerkin and it&rsquo;s finally Sansa talking and breathing, a creature of blood and cracks. Not the Lady of Winterfell, icy and unreachable, courteous even in the face of her own executioner. It is Sansa who passes her arms behind his back and buries her face against his chest while he does the same, rubbing his nose in her neck, under the lobe of her ear.</p><p>He hears her sigh, a tremulous sigh that suggests how stubbornly she refused to rest in the last few months, throwing herself headlong into the role of regent, protector, warrior.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think we will allow it?&rdquo; He remembers Arya, the deadly look that promises death. Bran and his words. Let the king be born.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill her,&rdquo; he hears her say. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p><p>It is true and this sharpens the torment he feels. He has loved three women in his life. The first died in his arms and helped him kill the boy, let the man be born. The second was an impossible love from which he fled until he managed to resist, familiar and full of temptations. He loved the third as long as he could, a love of war, of fire and blood, but that didn&rsquo;t give any peace at all.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s this woman, the woman who he shouldn&rsquo;t desire as he desires, the woman he promised to protect, the woman who gave him a purpose in a life he didn&rsquo;t want, a second chance for redemption. This woman who once was his sister and who is now family. It&rsquo;s Sansa that he wants, that he has chosen.</p><p>If the war failed to do so, it will be the attempts to protect each other that will eventually destroy them.</p><p>He touches her forehead with his lips, then her eyebrows, her nose, her cheeks. At a whisker from her mouth, he looks at her half-lidded eyelids. &ldquo;So I should watch while she kills you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish you weren&rsquo;t forced to choose. It&rsquo;s not fair, but the world rarely is.&rdquo; She puts her hand against his jaw. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry. I played my cards and lost. I proved I was right about everything, but what does it matter to be right? I have few regrets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Children. I would have liked to have some. Dark hair and grey-eyed like you, Arya and Father. Redheaded and blue eyes like Mother, Robb and Rickon.&rdquo;</p><p>He can imagine them and it&rsquo;s this new wish, the awful agony&nbsp;of her wrenching expression that makes him say, &ldquo;You can still have them if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>She shakes her head and the tears in her eyes breaks his heart.</p><p>*</p><p><i>Where did we get lost?

It has been years and years of history, of love, of fear, of passion and crying together, screaming together, making our hearts beat together as the emotion comes in every season. Thank you Game Of Thrones for not only be the best show this world has ever seen but for being our family, thank you for making us cry, make us laugh, make us nervous, make us screaming and a bunch of other sensations that I could describe here but you know, we all know. Well, today is the day that it ends a whole generation, can we ever say goodbye to this show? It&rsquo;s just so unbelievable that it&rsquo;s ending and we don&rsquo;t know how to act. Whatever happens today, as much this season wasn&rsquo;t the best one we still love you, and we always will love you, no matter all the bad writing that this season had, you are our family and saying goodbye to you is not easy I must say I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to be this hard, but all good things have to come to an end, and you know what they say: <i><b>\u201cWhat is dead may never die.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>To all the sensations, to all the happiness, to the freaking anxiety every Sunday, to the cast and everything else, thank you, Game Of Thrones!  </i></p>",

        "body": "<p>I never thought I\u2019d be writing a sequel to my \u201cSmarter Than Robb\u201d meta (<a href=\"https://geekprincess26.tumblr.com/post/184334232582/smarter-than-robb\">here</a>), especially not on the eve of the series finale of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d \u00a0However, that was before \u201cThe Bells\u201d (at least in my opinion) broke the show\u2019s streak of so-so to awful episodes that started somewhere in season 7. \u00a0It made me wonder and marvel and gasp and tear up and, above all, think. \u00a0So did the many articulate posts my fellow Jonsa fans have made about that episode, and in particular about Jon\u2019s role both in that segment of the show and in the watershed overwhelming Westeros at the moment. \u00a0As I rewatched the episode and read people\u2019s posts, I began seeing Jon\u2019s actions in a slightly different light. \u00a0Then I realized how similar they were to Ned Stark\u2019s doomed efforts to keep his family and the Seven Kingdoms safe and stabilized in season 1.</p><p>Ah, yes, Ned Stark, the original Northern fool \u2013 or, at least, that was how so many people, both on the show and off it, viewed him, much as they later saw his son nephew. \u00a0And what fools they both were, right? \u00a0Certainly they were such from a general perspective, but seen from Sansa\u2019s viewpoint, many of those actions attained the very height of idiocy. \u00a0Let us count the ways, starting with Sansa\u2019s father, Ned Stark:</p><p>1.\tHE LIED TO HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND THE WORLD <br/>He brought a Targaryen heir into his home under the nose of a king who had sworn to eradicate all Targaryens from the face of the earth and claimed that the boy was his bastard, without knowing if Jon would grow up to look like his birth father and therefore clue in Robert \u2013 and the rest of Westeros \u2013 to the truth. \u00a0He let his own wife think the worst of him, ensuring both a huge strain in their young marriage and her less-than-motherly treatment of poor Jon. \u00a0<i>What a stubborn, reckless idiot,</i> one could be forgiven for thinking. \u00a0And what an unnecessary sacrifice of his reputation as a man of honesty and honor, two of the things he valued most.</p><!-- more --><p>2.\tHE DISREGARDED HIS FAMILY\u2019S WARNINGS AND HEADED STRAIGHT INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE<br/>Many years later, when Jon Arryn died, Robert Baratheon requested that Ned replace the older man as his Hand. \u00a0Ned, a devoted family man, did not want to leave his family, and especially not to live in King\u2019s Landing with its politics and backstabbing. \u00a0And due to his friendship with Robert, he had a good chance to refuse the other man\u2019s offer while keeping his head, family, and honor intact. \u00a0But Lysa Arryn\u2019s raven arrived at Winterfell with its allegations that the Lannisters had murdered her husband. \u00a0That gave Ned reason to fear for Robert\u2019s safety, and so he left his family behind him. \u00a0No one could fault him for his desire to keep Robert on his throne and avoid another succession conflict, which the Seven Kingdoms could ill afford. \u00a0However, he could have employed any number of better, smarter options to fulfill that desire, right? \u00a0How about suggesting another Hand, one who could play the Southern political game more effectively? \u00a0How about sending ravens to other loyal friends of the king, or even meeting with them in person, to gather more information? \u00a0Maybe then he could have discovered the truth about Jon Arryn\u2019s death before his family antagonized the Lannisters.</p><p>3.\tHE DELIBERATELY SHOWED HIS HAND TO HIS ENEMY \u2013 ALL BECAUSE OF HONOR<br/>Speaking of the Lannisters, many would argue that Ned reached the height of his Northern naivet\u00e9 in his dealings with them. \u00a0After all, what kind of idiot would warn the very enemy he\u2019s about to rat out to the king? \u00a0We know that Ned did this with noble intentions. \u00a0He knew what Robert would do to Cersei and the children once he discovered Jaime\u2019s affair with Cersei, and despite his dislike of Cersei, his honor would not allow him to stand by while her children died horrible deaths. \u00a0Still, if he truly wanted to serve the greater good, could he not have let five lives go for the sake of the greater good? \u00a0After all, wasn\u2019t the greater good the reason he lied to everyone he knew about Jon, as well as his motivation for leaving his family to serve as Robert\u2019s Hand?</p><p>4.\tHE PLOTTED AGAINST THE \u201cKING\u201d OF WESTEROS WITHOUT SEEKING HELP AND COUNSEL FROM HIS FAMILY AND TRUSTWORTHY FRIENDS<br/>Not a good idea, right? \u00a0Especially when that means the continent\u2019s second succession crisis in two decades and it\u2019s not yet recovered from the first. \u00a0Ned\u2019s eventual aim was honorable and worthy, which helps to justify his dangerous and dishonorable actions, but he could (and should) have sought the advice and support of his wife, who\u2019s clearly a canny woman with a lot of connections. \u00a0Moreover, he probably should have at least considered involving Stark or Tully bannermen whom he knew would be loyal to him, rather than counting on Stannis Baratheon and a motley crew from King\u2019s Landing, all of whom had their own agendas.</p><p>Speaking of which\u2026</p><p>5.\tHE IGNORED HIS GUT INSTINCTS AND PLACED HIS TRUST IN A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY INDIVIDUAL<br/>Littlefinger rubbed Ned the wrong way from the day they met. \u00a0It took less than one episode after that for Ned to slam the snake against the wall of his own brothel by his neck for his perverted remarks about Catelyn, Ned\u2019s wife. \u00a0But Catelyn was convinced that Littlefinger would never harm her and therefore would not want to see any harm come to Ned because she loved Ned so much, so Ned ignored his first instincts \u2013 and Littlefinger\u2019s own warnings \u2013 which told him the man was a snake waiting to strike. \u00a0Instead, he chose to believe that Littlefinger would see the nobility \u2013 or at least the intrigue and the reward \u2013 in Ned\u2019s attempts to place the rightful heir on the throne and keep Westeros from being ruled by a beast like Joffrey. \u00a0But, as Ned found out the hard way, the most sophisticated strategy in the world doesn\u2019t mean a thing if you can\u2019t trust the people who are supposed to be helping you carry it out.</p><p>6.\tHE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE AND LEFT HIS FAMILY FOREVER \u2013 ALL FOR A MINUSCULE CHANCE AT KEEPING SANSA SAFE<br/>Granted, by the time Ned was brought out onto the steps of the Sept of Baelor, his options were very, very limited due to his own deliberate course of action. \u00a0He knew he would either (a) die, or (b) get sent to the Wall, separated from his family forever. \u00a0Either way, his life would essentially be over, and he would most likely be declared a traitor to the crown, which meant that unless his son Robb swore fealty to Joffrey (which he likely knew would never happen), his entire family would be considered traitors, and their lands and goods and freedom forfeit to Joffrey (and, by extension, Cersei). \u00a0Still, dying would be more honorable. \u00a0Accepting exile to the Wall meant lying abominably to earn a hollow life of shame \u2013 not an action the honorable Ned Stark would have taken lightly. \u00a0But he did it anyway, because doing it gave his beloved daughter Sansa a better chance at survival. \u00a0Of course, Ned failed to take into consideration the extent of Joffrey\u2019s megalomaniacal cruelty, and he died anyway for his troubles. </p><p>Certainly, many of Ned\u2019s actions, when taken at face value, don\u2019t look too brilliant. \u00a0That makes his more intelligent and shrewd deeds, such as the conspiracy to place Stannis on the throne, even more confusing. \u00a0One sees a picture of a noble and even heroic man, one who clearly has a brain for military and even sometimes political strategy, who hatches incredibly detailed and sophisticated plans but then blows them all in bursts of idiocy. \u00a0</p><p>But what motives lie behind that apparent idiocy? \u00a0That is the crucial question, and one that many viewers have missed, although the answer should surprise no one.</p><p>Every time Ned Stark made a \u201cstupid\u201d decision, it was for one or more of the following three reasons: 1) <b>serving the greater good of the realm</b> (leaving Winterfell to become Robert\u2019s Hand, taking on Littlefinger as a co-conspirator to put Stannis, the rightful heir, on the throne); 2) <b>acting honorably</b> (warning Cersei that he was about to reveal her affair with Jaime); and, most importantly, 3) <b>protecting his family</b>. \u00a0The motives are often intertwined, and sometimes one (such as honor) conflicts with one or more of the others (such as protecting Ned\u2019s family), but every one of the decisions outlined above has involved some combination of these three reasons.</p><p>Twelve-year-old Sansa, of course, could not entirely understand her father\u2019s actions or the complex motivations behind them. \u00a0All she saw was that he screwed up and lost his head for it. \u00a0When she got older, she had more of a capacity to understand why Ned did what he did. \u00a0As she says to Jon in episode 1 of season 7, \u201cHe was trying to protect [his daughters].\u201d \u00a0<b>However, that doesn\u2019t decrease the trauma his death put her through, and she wishes he would have been smarter by listening better to both his own instincts and the wise counsel of his family and friends.</b></p><p>Sound familiar? \u00a0Good. \u00a0Let\u2019s unpack some of Jon\u2019s more questionable decisions from the past two seasons, which parallel his uncle\u2019s to an uncanny degree, and see what his actions and mannerisms tell us about why he made those decisions:</p><p>1.\tHE LIED TO HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND THE WORLD<br/>During most of Jon\u2019s scenes with Daenerys, he\u2019s been uncomfortable, stilted, cautious, resigned, and even downright afraid, especially as season 8 has worn on. \u00a0His final \u201cI love you\u201d to her in the early scenes of \u201cThe Bells\u201d is just the latest, but perhaps the most obvious, instance in which he uses what\u2019s left of her romantic feelings for him in a desperate attempt to placate her and de-escalate her more violent tendencies. \u00a0The man is clearly not in love with Daenerys, and, based on his prior interactions with her, he never was (heck, he even looked uncomfortable while having sex with her!) \u2013 although that\u2019s an argument for a different post.</p><p>But Jon never spells this out clearly to either his people (sorry, but \u201cI gave up my crown to protect the North\u201d is an ambiguous allusion, not a specific explanation) or, even more important, his family, whom he loves more than anyone. \u00a0He can bring himself to admit his true parentage to his <strike>siblings </strike>cousins, but not that he deceived Daenerys into thinking he was in love with her. \u00a0Instead, he keeps reciting the tired refrain that \u201cshe\u2019s my queen; she\u2019ll be a good queen; you just don\u2019t know her.\u201d \u00a0Ironically, of course, and as another meta that contrasted Ned\u2019s circumstances with Jon\u2019s noted, his family members could and would help him if only he would ask for it. \u00a0Sansa is a terrific leader with a keen political mind and the clout to call the Northern banners to defend Jon against Daenerys, if she wanted to do it. \u00a0Arya is one hell of a warrior assassin. \u00a0And Bran\u2019s visions, as we\u2019ve seen, can work wonders. \u00a0Furthermore, all three of them are fiercely loyal to him. \u00a0But he still won\u2019t tell them squat about what he fears Daenerys is becoming, and even when Sansa figures it out during the battlements scene with Tyrion, you can see the wheels turning in her head over why the heck Jon didn\u2019t just tell her about it in the first place. </p><p>What an idiot, right? \u00a0But remember Ned Stark\u2019s three main motives behind some of his \u201cstupid\u201d decisions, and you\u2019ll see that Jon truly is his uncle\u2019s nephew. \u00a0Clearly, he sees Daenerys as a threat to the North in general and to his family in particular, especially Sansa (whom Daenerys threatened twice in the first episode alone). \u00a0The fewer people who know Jon\u2019s true feelings about her, the less he has to worry that she\u2019ll hear about them and go Dracarys on the people Jon cares about the most.</p><p>Ned Stark motives #1 and #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>2.\tHE DISREGARDED HIS FAMILY\u2019S WARNINGS AND HEADED STRAIGHT INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE<br/>Back in episode 2 of season 7, Sansa and the Northern lords between them listed every possible reason that Jon should rethink his impulsive decision to travel to Dragonstone and form an alliance with a Targaryen who, given the family\u2019s history of madness and violence, might very well either listen to Jon or burn him on the spot. \u00a0Granted, Tyrion Lannister, whom both Jon and Sansa trusted, had vouched for Daenerys, and neither of them particularly wanted Cersei Lannister to stay on the Iron Throne, but to Sansa\u2019s mind, Daenerys was enough of an unknown quantity \u2013 with three dragons to boot \u2013 that Jon should have considered his decision a bit more thoroughly.</p><p>But Jon, like his uncle, had a larger goal in mind that outweighed his desire to stay home with the only family he had. \u00a0Jon\u2019s goal, though, was not the realm\u2019s political stability, but its survival. \u00a0To his mind, the only hope he had of achieving that goal for his people and the people of the other six kingdoms was to bring Daenerys, her armies, her dragons, and her dragonglass back North. \u00a0That much he does admit to Sansa in episode 1 of season 8, but, as she points out, he hadn\u2019t fully considered the price he was paying for her assistance. \u00a0Had he known ahead of time, though, I think our beloved, impulsive hero would have done the same thing all over again. \u00a0To him, every sacrifice he made on Daenerys\u2019s altar was worth it to save his family, the North, and Westeros, in that order.</p><p>Ned Stark motives #1 and #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>3.\tHE DELIBERATELY SHOWED HIS HAND TO HIS ENEMY \u2013 ALL BECAUSE OF HONOR<br/>When Jon first met Daenerys, he tried to convince her to join the fight against the White Walkers by every above-board means possible. \u00a0He asked her nicely. \u00a0He showed her evidence to support his claims (depending on what you believe about the cave drawings, but I think they were authentic). \u00a0He offered his support to her claim to the Iron Throne. \u00a0He warned her when he received the raven from Bran indicating that the Night King and his armies were on the way to Eastwatch. \u00a0Only when Daenerys refused beyond all reason to drop her demand that Jon bend the knee did his actions become more underhanded and calculated. \u00a0Only after he realized that his only other option was imprisonment did he agree to the mad idea of the Wight Hunt. \u00a0Only after Cersei had apparently refused to join with them at the dragon pit summit and Daenerys began to waver in her commitment to help save the realm did Jon play the false romance card. \u00a0He did the \u201cdishonorable\u201d thing, as Ned would have put it (sleeping with a woman he had no plans to marry and risking fathering a bastard), only after his attempts at honor, as he saw them, had failed.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #2: CONFIRMED.</p><p>4.\tHE PLOTTED AGAINST THE \u201cQUEEN\u201d OF WESTEROS WITHOUT SEEKING HELP AND COUNSEL FROM HIS FAMILY<br/>(Well, he plotted against Cersei Lannister, too, but that was a given from the beginning, so I won\u2019t go into it any further here.)</p><p>By season 8, Jon knows Daenerys Targaryen well enough to be wary of her, at the very least, and by the end of episode 1, he\u2019s clearly beginning to see just how applicable the \u201c-[A]erys\u201d at the end of her name is. \u00a0She threatens Sansa twice. \u00a0Sam tells him that she killed Randyll and Dickon after they had already surrendered on the field of battle. \u00a0She clearly expects the North to kowtow to her and loves it when her dragons frighten them.</p><p>As the season wears on, Daenerys\u2019s paranoia and impulsiveness increase at lightning speed. \u00a0In episode 4 alone, she threatens Sansa for a third time, forces Jon into promising not to tell his own family who he really is, and pressures him to continue his sexual relationship with her even when he doesn\u2019t want to do it. \u00a0Jon clearly sees the writing on the wall at that point, and he finally rebels against her in his own way by breaking his (coerced) promise and telling his cousins that he\u2019s not Ned Stark\u2019s son. \u00a0That would have been the perfect opportunity for him to enlist their help against Daenerys. \u00a0As mentioned above, they all have skill sets that could help him greatly in that endeavor. \u00a0Instead, he decides that it\u2019s more important to \u201cprotect\u201d them by giving them no choice in the matter and separating them from the threat Daenerys has become. \u00a0He swears allegiance once again to the Dragon Queen and heads south at her command with no clear plan to stop her oncoming descent into full-fledged villainy except to talk her out of it, and then maybe deal with any out-of-control actions on her part once Cersei Lannister has been defeated. \u00a0Sigh.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>5.\tHE IGNORED HIS GUT INSTINCTS AND PLACED HIS TRUST IN A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY INDIVIDUAL<br/>Even though Jon was the one who insisted on heading off to Dragonstone in season 7 to persuade a completely unknown quantity descended from the craziest, most violent House the Seven Kingdoms have ever had the misfortune to host, he clearly has his reservations about it. \u00a0He\u2019s rightly uneasy when the Dothraki confiscate his ships and weapons, and just as rightly indignant when Daenerys insults him and his family. \u00a0However, he persists in trying to obtain her assistance because she can help him with his goal of defeating the dead, much like Ned thought Littlefinger could help him with his goal of putting the rightful heir on the throne of Westeros. \u00a0He believes, at least for a time, that she\u2019ll be a better choice as an ally than would Cersei Lannister, and that belief makes him overlook warning signal after warning signal: her threat to burn down the Red Keep, her insistence on imprisoning him on Dragonstone until he agrees to go on the wight hunt, her hauling him to King\u2019s Landing against his will, her threats against his family (particularly Sansa) \u2013 all to defeat the dead. \u00a0Until the dead have finally been defeated, and he gets a full view of Daenerys\u2019s true colors, just like Ned Stark got an eyeful of Littlefinger\u2019s. \u00a0</p><p>Ned Stark motive #1: CONFIRMED.</p><p>6.\tHE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE AND LEFT HIS FAMILY FOREVER \u2013 ALL FOR A MINUSCULE CHANCE AT KEEPING SANSA SAFE<br/>Jon knew there was a high likelihood that he\u2019d die defending Winterfell against the dead in episode 3, and a similar possibility that he\u2019d die trying to take King\u2019s Landing with Daenerys\u2019s armies in episode 5. \u00a0Dying in episode 3 would have meant dying with some honor in defense of his home, but once he went south to die in episodes 4 and 5, he knew that his options were limited. \u00a0He could either (a) die in the service of a pyromaniac tyrant, or (b) live, but only under the terms she\u2019d dictated to him in episode 4. \u00a0Either way, he knew he might never be able to see his family again, and either way, he\u2019d brought shame and dishonor upon himself and his family. \u00a0As with Ned Stark, the greater shame lay in the second option, which in Jon\u2019s case basically involved being enslaved, sexually and otherwise, to his cruel and unhinged aunt (yes, the great \u201cBreaker of Chains\u201d \u2013 oh, the irony!).</p><p>But instead of rushing forward to his death in King\u2019s Landing, as he had in the Battle of the Bastards, Jon chooses to live. \u00a0He chooses to retreat with as many of his men as he can and risk living a life of slavery and shame. \u00a0If he\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t protect his family. <b>\u00a0He can\u2019t protect Sansa. \u00a0</b>He\u2019s promised to protect her, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s determined to do no matter what the cost \u2013 to his honor, his life, and his soul. \u00a0It\u2019s beautiful, but incredibly tragic.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>So, in the end, was Jon Snow really smarter than his uncle? \u00a0Unlike with Robb, I\u2019d have to say no, and I think that Sansa, even as an adult and with the capacity and insight she now has to understand the proverbial methods behind both men\u2019s madness \u2013 would as well. \u00a0Both men had significant military skills, and both men planned and executed fairly sophisticated schemes. \u00a0And both were willing to protect their families, with a special emphasis on Sansa, no matter what the cost. \u00a0But both had the same fatal flaws: (a) they were a bit too noble in some cases for their own good, (b) they held their cards too close to their chests, and &copy; they failed to communicate with and seek the aid of the trustworthy people around them. \u00a0Only good luck \u2013 and the intervention of his family, however much he tried to avoid it \u2013 has kept Jon alive longer than Ned. \u00a0I participated in an interesting Tumblr discussion the other day (which I have tried and failed to track down for reference here), and one of the other posters put the difference between Jon and Ned in an absolutely ingenious way. \u00a0Ned, the poster pointed out, had a \u201cpack\u201d full of children, none of whom could assist him in the way that he needed. \u00a0(I\u2019d add to that assertion that he had a brilliant asset in Cat, but she couldn\u2019t be by his side to advise him moment to moment the way he needed to be advised.) \u00a0But Jon has a \u201cpack\u201d of peers \u2013 fellow young adults with the ability and the influence to help him defeat an enemy he has no hope of taking down on his own. \u00a0I absolutely agree with this, and I think Sansa would too. \u00a0In fact, she\u2019s already correctly guessed (most of) Jon\u2019s reasoning and begun taking matters into her own hands to help him. \u00a0I\u2019d love it if she did even more in the finale, along with Arya and Bran.</p><p>After all, they remember, even if Ned and Jon themselves do not, that <b>the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives</b>. \u00a0They love him even though he\u2019s never been any smarter than Ned. \u00a0(Although, of course, he might do better in the future, after Daenerys has been dealt with, to choose a wife like the wife his father married \u2013 politically smarter than he is, unafraid to tell him the unvarnished truth when he needs it, and, of course, red-headed. \u00a0I don\u2019t think Sansa would mind that, either.)<br/></p>",

\u201cThe Bells\u201d (at least in my opinion) broke the show\u2019s streak of so-so to awful episodes that started somewhere in season 7. \u00a0It made me wonder and marvel and gasp and tear up and,

general perspective, but seen from Sansa\u2019s viewpoint, many of those actions attained the very height of idiocy. \u00a0Let us count the ways, starting with Sansa\u2019s father, Ned Stark:</p><p>1.\tHE LIED TO HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND THE WORLD <br>He brought a Targaryen heir into his home under the nose of a king who had sworn to eradicate all Targaryens from the face of the earth and claimed that the boy was his bastard, without knowing if Jon would grow up to look like his birth father and therefore clue in Robert \u2013 and the rest of Westeros \u2013 to the truth.

one could be forgiven for thinking. \u00a0And what an unnecessary sacrifice of his reputation as a man of honesty and honor, two of the things he valued most.</p>[[MORE]]<p>2.\tHE DISREGARDED HIS FAMILY\u2019S WARNINGS AND HEADED STRAIGHT INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE<br>Many years later, when Jon Arryn died, Robert Baratheon requested that Ned replace the older man as his Hand. \u00a0Ned, a devoted family man, did not want to leave his family, and especially not to live in King\u2019s Landing with its politics and backstabbing. \u00a0And due to his friendship with Robert, he had a good chance to refuse the other man\u2019s offer while keeping his head, family, and honor intact. \u00a0But Lysa Arryn\u2019s raven arrived at Winterfell with its allegations that the Lannisters had murdered her husband. \u00a0That gave Ned reason to fear for Robert\u2019s safety, and so he left his family behind him. \u00a0No one could fault him for his desire to keep Robert on his throne and avoid another succession conflict, which the Seven Kingdoms could ill afford. \u00a0However, he could have employed any number of better, smarter options to fulfill that desire, right? \u00a0How about suggesting another Hand, one who could play the Southern political game more effectively? \u00a0How about sending ravens to other loyal friends of the king, or even meeting with them in person, to gather more information? \u00a0Maybe then he could have discovered the truth about Jon Arryn\u2019s death before his family antagonized the Lannisters.</p><p>3.\tHE DELIBERATELY SHOWED HIS HAND TO HIS ENEMY \u2013 ALL BECAUSE OF HONOR<br>Speaking of the Lannisters, many would argue that Ned reached the height of his Northern naivet\u00e9 in his dealings with them. \u00a0After all, what kind of idiot would warn the very enemy he\u2019s about to rat out to the king? \u00a0We know that Ned did this with noble intentions. \u00a0He knew what Robert would do to Cersei and the children once he discovered Jaime\u2019s affair with Cersei, and despite his dislike of Cersei, his honor would not allow him to stand by while her children died horrible deaths. \u00a0Still, if he truly wanted to serve the greater good, could he not have let five lives go for the sake of the greater good? \u00a0After all, wasn\u2019t the greater good the reason he lied to everyone he knew about Jon, as well as his motivation for leaving his family to serve as Robert\u2019s Hand?</p><p>4.\tHE PLOTTED AGAINST THE \u201cKING\u201d OF WESTEROS WITHOUT SEEKING HELP AND COUNSEL FROM HIS FAMILY AND TRUSTWORTHY FRIENDS<br>Not a good idea, right? \u00a0Especially when that means the continent\u2019s second succession crisis in two decades and it\u2019s not yet recovered from the first. \u00a0Ned\u2019s eventual aim was honorable and worthy, which helps to justify his dangerous and dishonorable actions, but he could (and should) have sought the advice and support of his wife, who\u2019s clearly a canny woman with a lot of connections. \u00a0Moreover, he probably should have at least considered involving Stark or Tully bannermen whom he knew would be loyal to him, rather than counting on Stannis Baratheon and a motley crew from King\u2019s Landing, all of whom had their own agendas.</p><p>Speaking of which\u2026</p><p>5.\tHE IGNORED HIS GUT INSTINCTS AND PLACED HIS TRUST IN A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY INDIVIDUAL<br>Littlefinger rubbed Ned the wrong way from the day they met. \u00a0It took less than one episode after that for Ned to slam the snake against the wall of his own brothel by his neck for his perverted remarks about Catelyn, Ned\u2019s wife. \u00a0But Catelyn was convinced that Littlefinger would never harm her and therefore would not want to see any harm come to Ned because she loved Ned so much, so Ned ignored his first instincts \u2013 and Littlefinger\u2019s own warnings \u2013 which told him the man was a snake waiting to strike. \u00a0Instead, he chose to believe that Littlefinger would see the nobility \u2013 or at least the intrigue and the reward \u2013 in Ned\u2019s attempts to place the rightful heir on the throne and keep Westeros from being ruled by a beast like Joffrey. \u00a0But, as Ned found out the hard way, the most sophisticated strategy in the world doesn\u2019t mean a thing if you can\u2019t trust the people who are supposed to be helping you carry it out.</p><p>6.\tHE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE AND LEFT HIS FAMILY FOREVER \u2013 ALL FOR A MINUSCULE CHANCE AT KEEPING SANSA SAFE<br>Granted, by the time Ned was brought out onto the steps of the Sept of Baelor, his options were very, very limited due to his own deliberate course of action. \u00a0He knew he would either (a) die, or (b) get sent to the Wall, separated from his family forever. \u00a0Either way, his life would essentially be over, and he would most likely be declared a traitor to the crown, which meant that unless his son Robb swore fealty to Joffrey (which he likely knew would never happen), his entire family would be considered traitors, and their lands and goods and freedom forfeit to Joffrey (and, by extension, Cersei). \u00a0Still, dying would be more honorable. \u00a0Accepting exile to the Wall meant lying abominably to earn a hollow life of shame \u2013 not an action the honorable Ned Stark would have taken lightly. \u00a0But he did it anyway, because doing it gave his beloved daughter Sansa a better chance at survival. \u00a0Of course, Ned failed to take into consideration the extent of Joffrey\u2019s megalomaniacal cruelty, and he died anyway for his troubles. </p><p>Certainly, many of Ned\u2019s actions, when taken at face value, don\u2019t look too brilliant. \u00a0That makes his more intelligent and shrewd deeds, such as the conspiracy to place Stannis on the throne, even more confusing. \u00a0One sees a picture of a noble and even heroic man, one who clearly has a brain for military and even sometimes political strategy, who hatches incredibly detailed and sophisticated plans but then blows them all in bursts of idiocy. \u00a0</p><p>But what motives lie behind that apparent idiocy? \u00a0That is the crucial question, and one that many viewers have missed, although the answer should surprise no one.</p><p>Every time Ned Stark made a \u201cstupid\u201d decision, it was for one or more of the following three reasons: 1) <b>serving the greater good of the realm</b> (leaving Winterfell to become Robert\u2019s Hand, taking on Littlefinger as a co-conspirator to put Stannis, the rightful heir, on the throne); 2) <b>acting honorably</b> (warning Cersei that he was about to reveal her affair with Jaime); and, most importantly, 3) <b>protecting his family</b>. \u00a0The motives are often intertwined, and sometimes one (such as honor) conflicts with one or more of the others (such as protecting Ned\u2019s family), but every one of the decisions outlined above has involved some combination of these three reasons.</p><p>Twelve-year-old Sansa, of course, could not entirely understand her father\u2019s actions or the complex motivations behind them. \u00a0All she saw was that he screwed up and lost his head for it. \u00a0When she got older, she had more of a capacity to understand why Ned did what he did. \u00a0As she says to Jon in episode 1 of season 7, \u201cHe was trying to protect [his daughters].\u201d \u00a0<b>However, that doesn\u2019t decrease the trauma his death put her through, and she wishes he would have been smarter by listening better to both his own instincts and the wise counsel of his family and friends.</b></p><p>Sound familiar? \u00a0Good. \u00a0Let\u2019s unpack some of Jon\u2019s more questionable decisions from the past two seasons, which parallel his uncle\u2019s to an uncanny degree, and see what his actions and mannerisms tell us about why he made those decisions:</p><p>1.\tHE LIED TO HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND THE WORLD<br>During most of Jon\u2019s scenes with Daenerys, he\u2019s been uncomfortable, stilted, cautious, resigned, and even downright afraid, especially as season 8 has worn on. \u00a0His final \u201cI love you\u201d to her in the early scenes of \u201cThe Bells\u201d is just the latest, but perhaps the most obvious, instance in which he uses what\u2019s left of her romantic feelings for him in a desperate attempt to placate her and de-escalate her more violent tendencies. \u00a0The man is clearly not in love with Daenerys, and, based on his prior interactions with her, he never was (heck, he even looked uncomfortable while having sex with her!) \u2013 although that\u2019s an argument for a different post.</p><p>But Jon never spells this out clearly to either his people (sorry, but \u201cI gave up my crown to protect the North\u201d is an ambiguous allusion, not a specific explanation) or, even more important, his family, whom he loves more than anyone. \u00a0He can bring himself to admit his true parentage to his <strike>siblings </strike>cousins, but not that he deceived Daenerys into thinking he was in love with her. \u00a0Instead, he keeps reciting the tired refrain that \u201cshe\u2019s my queen; she\u2019ll be a good queen; you just don\u2019t know her.\u201d \u00a0Ironically, of course, and as another meta that contrasted Ned\u2019s circumstances with Jon\u2019s noted, his family members could and would help him if only he would ask for it. \u00a0Sansa is a terrific leader with a keen political mind and the clout to call the Northern banners to defend Jon against Daenerys, if she wanted to do it. \u00a0Arya is one hell of a warrior assassin. \u00a0And Bran\u2019s visions, as we\u2019ve seen, can work wonders. \u00a0Furthermore, all three of them are fiercely loyal to him. \u00a0But he still won\u2019t tell them squat about what he fears Daenerys is becoming, and even when Sansa figures it out during the battlements scene with Tyrion, you can see the wheels turning in her head over why the heck Jon didn\u2019t just tell her about it in the first place. </p><p>What an idiot, right? \u00a0But remember Ned Stark\u2019s three main motives behind some of his \u201cstupid\u201d decisions, and you\u2019ll see that Jon truly is his uncle\u2019s nephew. \u00a0Clearly, he sees Daenerys as a threat to the North in general and to his family in particular, especially Sansa (whom Daenerys threatened twice in the first episode alone). \u00a0The fewer people who know Jon\u2019s true feelings about her, the less he has to worry that she\u2019ll hear about them and go Dracarys on the people Jon cares about the most.</p><p>Ned Stark motives #1 and #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>2.\tHE DISREGARDED HIS FAMILY\u2019S WARNINGS AND HEADED STRAIGHT INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE<br>Back in episode 2 of season 7, Sansa and the Northern lords between them listed every possible reason that Jon should rethink his impulsive decision to travel to Dragonstone and form an alliance with a Targaryen who, given the family\u2019s history of madness and violence, might very well either listen to Jon or burn him on the spot. \u00a0Granted, Tyrion Lannister, whom both Jon and Sansa trusted, had vouched for Daenerys, and neither of them particularly wanted Cersei Lannister to stay on the Iron Throne, but to Sansa\u2019s mind, Daenerys was enough of an unknown quantity \u2013 with three dragons to boot \u2013 that Jon should have considered his decision a bit more thoroughly.</p><p>But Jon, like his uncle, had a larger goal in mind that outweighed his desire to stay home with the only family he had. \u00a0Jon\u2019s goal, though, was not the realm\u2019s political stability, but its survival. \u00a0To his mind, the only hope he had of achieving that goal for his people and the people of the other six kingdoms was to bring Daenerys, her armies, her dragons, and her dragonglass back North. \u00a0That much he does admit to Sansa in episode 1 of season 8, but, as she points out, he hadn\u2019t fully considered the price he was paying for her assistance. \u00a0Had he known ahead of time, though, I think our beloved, impulsive hero would have done the same thing all over again. \u00a0To him, every sacrifice he made on Daenerys\u2019s altar was worth it to save his family, the North, and Westeros, in that order.</p><p>Ned Stark motives #1 and #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>3.\tHE DELIBERATELY SHOWED HIS HAND TO HIS ENEMY \u2013 ALL BECAUSE OF HONOR<br>When Jon first met Daenerys, he tried to convince her to join the fight against the White Walkers by every above-board means possible. \u00a0He asked her nicely. \u00a0He showed her evidence to support his claims (depending on what you believe about the cave drawings, but I think they were authentic). \u00a0He offered his support to her claim to the Iron Throne. \u00a0He warned her when he received the raven from Bran indicating that the Night King and his armies were on the way to Eastwatch. \u00a0Only when Daenerys refused beyond all reason to drop her demand that Jon bend the knee did his actions become more underhanded and calculated. \u00a0Only after he realized that his only other option was imprisonment did he agree to the mad idea of the Wight Hunt. \u00a0Only after Cersei had apparently refused to join with them at the dragon pit summit and Daenerys began to waver in her commitment to help save the realm did Jon play the false romance card. \u00a0He did the \u201cdishonorable\u201d thing, as Ned would have put it (sleeping with a woman he had no plans to marry and risking fathering a bastard), only after his attempts at honor, as he saw them, had failed.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #2: CONFIRMED.</p><p>4.\tHE PLOTTED AGAINST THE \u201cQUEEN\u201d OF WESTEROS WITHOUT SEEKING HELP AND COUNSEL FROM HIS FAMILY<br>(Well, he plotted against Cersei Lannister, too, but that was a given from the beginning, so I won\u2019t go into it any further here.)</p><p>By season 8, Jon knows Daenerys Targaryen well enough to be wary of her, at the very least, and by the end of episode 1, he\u2019s clearly beginning to see just how applicable the \u201c-[A]erys\u201d at the end of her name is. \u00a0She threatens Sansa twice. \u00a0Sam tells him that she killed Randyll and Dickon after they had already surrendered on the field of battle. \u00a0She clearly expects the North to kowtow to her and loves it when her dragons frighten them.</p><p>As the season wears on, Daenerys\u2019s paranoia and impulsiveness increase at lightning speed. \u00a0In episode 4 alone, she threatens Sansa for a third time, forces Jon into promising not to tell his own family who he really is, and pressures him to continue his sexual relationship with her even when he doesn\u2019t want to do it. \u00a0Jon clearly sees the writing on the wall at that point, and he finally rebels against her in his own way by breaking his (coerced) promise and telling his cousins that he\u2019s not Ned Stark\u2019s son. \u00a0That would have been the perfect opportunity for him to enlist their help against Daenerys. \u00a0As mentioned above, they all have skill sets that could help him greatly in that endeavor. \u00a0Instead, he decides that it\u2019s more important to \u201cprotect\u201d them by giving them no choice in the matter and separating them from the threat Daenerys has become. \u00a0He swears allegiance once again to the Dragon Queen and heads south at her command with no clear plan to stop her oncoming descent into full-fledged villainy except to talk her out of it, and then maybe deal with any out-of-control actions on her part once Cersei Lannister has been defeated. \u00a0Sigh.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>5.\tHE IGNORED HIS GUT INSTINCTS AND PLACED HIS TRUST IN A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY INDIVIDUAL<br>Even though Jon was the one who insisted on heading off to Dragonstone in season 7 to persuade a completely unknown quantity descended from the craziest, most violent House the Seven Kingdoms have ever had the misfortune to host, he clearly has his reservations about it. \u00a0He\u2019s rightly uneasy when the Dothraki confiscate his ships and weapons, and just as rightly indignant when Daenerys insults him and his family. \u00a0However, he persists in trying to obtain her assistance because she can help him with his goal of defeating the dead, much like Ned thought Littlefinger could help him with his goal of putting the rightful heir on the throne of Westeros. \u00a0He believes, at least for a time, that she\u2019ll be a better choice as an ally than would Cersei Lannister, and that belief makes him overlook warning signal after warning signal: her threat to burn down the Red Keep, her insistence on imprisoning him on Dragonstone until he agrees to go on the wight hunt, her hauling him to King\u2019s Landing against his will, her threats against his family (particularly Sansa) \u2013 all to defeat the dead. \u00a0Until the dead have finally been defeated, and he gets a full view of Daenerys\u2019s true colors, just like Ned Stark got an eyeful of Littlefinger\u2019s. \u00a0</p><p>Ned Stark motive #1: CONFIRMED.</p><p>6.\tHE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE AND LEFT HIS FAMILY FOREVER \u2013 ALL FOR A MINUSCULE CHANCE AT KEEPING SANSA SAFE<br>Jon knew there was a high likelihood that he\u2019d die defending Winterfell against the dead in episode 3, and a similar possibility that he\u2019d die trying to take King\u2019s Landing with Daenerys\u2019s armies in episode 5. \u00a0Dying in episode 3 would have meant dying with some honor in defense of his home, but once he went south to die in episodes 4 and 5, he knew that his options were limited. \u00a0He could either (a) die in the service of a pyromaniac tyrant, or (b) live, but only under the terms she\u2019d dictated to him in episode 4. \u00a0Either way, he knew he might never be able to see his family again, and either way, he\u2019d brought shame and dishonor upon himself and his family. \u00a0As with Ned Stark, the greater shame lay in the second option, which in Jon\u2019s case basically involved being enslaved, sexually and otherwise, to his cruel and unhinged aunt (yes, the great \u201cBreaker of Chains\u201d \u2013 oh, the irony!).</p><p>But instead of rushing forward to his death in King\u2019s Landing, as he had in the Battle of the Bastards, Jon chooses to live. \u00a0He chooses to retreat with as many of his men as he can and risk living a life of slavery and shame. \u00a0If he\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t protect his family. <b>\u00a0He can\u2019t protect Sansa. \u00a0</b>He\u2019s promised to protect her, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s determined to do no matter what the cost \u2013 to his honor, his life, and his soul. \u00a0It\u2019s beautiful, but incredibly tragic.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>So, in the end, was Jon Snow really smarter than his uncle? \u00a0Unlike with Robb, I\u2019d have to say no, and I think that Sansa, even as an adult and with the capacity and insight she now has to understand the proverbial methods behind both men\u2019s madness \u2013 would as well. \u00a0Both men had significant military skills, and both men planned and executed fairly sophisticated schemes. \u00a0And both were willing to protect their families, with a special emphasis on Sansa, no matter what the cost. \u00a0But both had the same fatal flaws: (a) they were a bit too noble in some cases for their own good, (b) they held their cards too close to their chests, and \u00a9 they failed to communicate with and seek the aid of the trustworthy people around them. \u00a0Only good luck \u2013 and the intervention of his family, however much he tried to avoid it \u2013 has kept Jon alive longer than Ned. \u00a0I participated in an interesting Tumblr discussion the other day (which I have tried and failed to track down for reference here), and one of the other posters put the difference between Jon and Ned in an absolutely ingenious way. \u00a0Ned, the poster pointed out, had a \u201cpack\u201d full of children, none of whom could assist him in the way that he needed. \u00a0(I\u2019d add to that assertion that he had a brilliant asset in Cat, but she couldn\u2019t be by his side to advise him moment to moment the way he needed to be advised.) \u00a0But Jon has a \u201cpack\u201d of peers \u2013 fellow young adults with the ability and the influence to help him defeat an enemy he has no hope of taking down on his own. \u00a0I absolutely agree with this, and I think Sansa would too. \u00a0In fact, she\u2019s already correctly guessed (most of) Jon\u2019s reasoning and begun taking matters into her own hands to help him. \u00a0I\u2019d love it if she did even more in the finale, along with Arya and Bran.</p><p>After all, they remember, even if Ned and Jon themselves do not, that <b>the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives</b>. \u00a0They love him even though he\u2019s never been any smarter than Ned. \u00a0(Although, of course, he might do better in the future, after Daenerys has been dealt with, to choose a wife like the wife his father married \u2013 politically smarter than he is, unafraid to tell him the unvarnished truth when he needs it, and, of course, red-headed. \u00a0I don\u2019t think Sansa would mind that, either.)<br></p>",

href=\"https://geekprincess26.tumblr.com/post/184334232582/smarter-than-robb\">here</a>), especially not on the eve of the series finale of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d \u00a0However, that was before \u201cThe Bells\u201d (at least in my opinion) broke the show\u2019s streak of so-so to awful episodes that started somewhere in season 7. \u00a0It made me wonder and marvel and gasp and tear up and, above all, think. \u00a0So did the many articulate posts my fellow Jonsa fans have made about that episode, and in particular about Jon\u2019s role both in that segment of the show and in the watershed overwhelming Westeros at the moment. \u00a0As I rewatched the episode and read people\u2019s posts, I began seeing Jon\u2019s actions in a slightly different light. \u00a0Then I realized how similar they were to Ned Stark\u2019s doomed efforts to keep his family and the Seven Kingdoms safe and stabilized in season 1.</p><p>Ah, yes, Ned Stark, the original Northern fool \u2013 or, at least, that was how so many people, both on the show and off it, viewed him, much as they later saw his son nephew. \u00a0And what fools they both were, right? \u00a0Certainly they were such from a general perspective, but seen from Sansa\u2019s viewpoint, many of those actions attained the very height of idiocy. \u00a0Let us count the ways, starting with Sansa\u2019s father, Ned Stark:</p><p>1.\tHE LIED TO HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND THE WORLD <br>He brought a Targaryen heir into his home under the nose of a king who had sworn to eradicate all Targaryens from the face of the earth and claimed that the boy was his bastard, without knowing if Jon would grow up to look like his birth father and therefore clue in Robert \u2013 and the rest of Westeros \u2013 to the truth. \u00a0He let his own wife think the worst of him, ensuring both a huge strain in their young marriage and her less-than-motherly treatment of poor Jon. \u00a0<i>What a stubborn, reckless idiot,</i> one could be forgiven for thinking. \u00a0And what an unnecessary sacrifice of his reputation as a man of honesty and honor, two of the things he valued most.</p>[[MORE]]<p>2.\tHE DISREGARDED HIS FAMILY\u2019S WARNINGS AND HEADED STRAIGHT INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE<br>Many years later, when Jon Arryn died, Robert Baratheon requested that Ned replace the older man as his Hand. \u00a0Ned, a devoted family man, did not want to leave his family, and especially not to live in King\u2019s Landing with its politics and backstabbing. \u00a0And due to his friendship with Robert, he had a good chance to refuse the other man\u2019s offer while keeping his head, family, and honor intact. \u00a0But Lysa Arryn\u2019s raven arrived at Winterfell with its allegations that the Lannisters had murdered her husband. \u00a0That gave Ned reason to fear for Robert\u2019s safety, and so he left his family behind him. \u00a0No one could fault him for his desire to keep Robert on his throne and avoid another succession conflict, which the Seven Kingdoms could ill afford. \u00a0However, he could have employed any number of better, smarter options to fulfill that desire, right? \u00a0How about suggesting another Hand, one who could play the Southern political game more effectively? \u00a0How about sending ravens to other loyal friends of the king, or even meeting with them in person, to gather more information? \u00a0Maybe then he could have discovered the truth about Jon Arryn\u2019s death before his family antagonized the Lannisters.</p><p>3.\tHE DELIBERATELY SHOWED HIS HAND TO HIS ENEMY \u2013 ALL BECAUSE OF HONOR<br>Speaking of the Lannisters, many would argue that Ned reached the height of his Northern naivet\u00e9 in his dealings with them. \u00a0After all, what kind of idiot would warn the very enemy he\u2019s about to rat out to the king? \u00a0We know that Ned did this with noble intentions. \u00a0He knew what Robert would do to Cersei and the children once he discovered Jaime\u2019s affair with Cersei, and despite his dislike of Cersei, his honor would not allow him to stand by while her children died horrible deaths. \u00a0Still, if he truly wanted to serve the greater good, could he not have let five lives go for the sake of the greater good? \u00a0After all, wasn\u2019t the greater good the reason he lied to everyone he knew about Jon, as well as his motivation for leaving his family to serve as Robert\u2019s Hand?</p><p>4.\tHE PLOTTED AGAINST THE \u201cKING\u201d OF WESTEROS WITHOUT SEEKING HELP AND COUNSEL FROM HIS FAMILY AND TRUSTWORTHY FRIENDS<br>Not a good idea, right? \u00a0Especially when that means the continent\u2019s second succession crisis in two decades and it\u2019s not yet recovered from the first. \u00a0Ned\u2019s eventual aim was honorable and worthy, which helps to justify his dangerous and dishonorable actions, but he could (and should) have sought the advice and support of his wife, who\u2019s clearly a canny woman with a lot of connections. \u00a0Moreover, he probably should have at least considered involving Stark or Tully bannermen whom he knew would be loyal to him, rather than counting on Stannis Baratheon and a motley crew from King\u2019s Landing, all of whom had their own agendas.</p><p>Speaking of which\u2026</p><p>5.\tHE IGNORED HIS GUT INSTINCTS AND PLACED HIS TRUST IN A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY INDIVIDUAL<br>Littlefinger rubbed Ned the wrong way from the day they met. \u00a0It took less than one episode after that for Ned to slam the snake against the wall of his own brothel by his neck for his perverted remarks about Catelyn, Ned\u2019s wife. \u00a0But Catelyn was convinced that Littlefinger would never harm her and therefore would not want to see any harm come to Ned because she loved Ned so much, so Ned ignored his first instincts \u2013 and Littlefinger\u2019s own warnings \u2013 which told him the man was a snake waiting to strike. \u00a0Instead, he chose to believe that Littlefinger would see the nobility \u2013 or at least the intrigue and the reward \u2013 in Ned\u2019s attempts to place the rightful heir on the throne and keep Westeros from being ruled by a beast like Joffrey. \u00a0But, as Ned found out the hard way, the most sophisticated strategy in the world doesn\u2019t mean a thing if you can\u2019t trust the people who are supposed to be helping you carry it out.</p><p>6.\tHE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE AND LEFT HIS FAMILY FOREVER \u2013 ALL FOR A MINUSCULE CHANCE AT KEEPING SANSA SAFE<br>Granted, by the time Ned was brought out onto the steps of the Sept of Baelor, his options were very, very limited due to his own deliberate course of action. \u00a0He knew he would either (a) die, or (b) get sent to the Wall, separated from his family forever. \u00a0Either way, his life would essentially be over, and he would most likely be declared a traitor to the crown, which meant that unless his son Robb swore fealty to Joffrey (which he likely knew would never happen), his entire family would be considered traitors, and their lands and goods and freedom forfeit to Joffrey (and, by extension, Cersei). \u00a0Still, dying would be more honorable. \u00a0Accepting exile to the Wall meant lying abominably to earn a hollow life of shame \u2013 not an action the honorable Ned Stark would have taken lightly. \u00a0But he did it anyway, because doing it gave his beloved daughter Sansa a better chance at survival. \u00a0Of course, Ned failed to take into consideration the extent of Joffrey\u2019s megalomaniacal cruelty, and he died anyway for his troubles. </p><p>Certainly, many of Ned\u2019s actions, when taken at face value, don\u2019t look too brilliant. \u00a0That makes his more intelligent and shrewd deeds, such as the conspiracy to place Stannis on the throne, even more confusing. \u00a0One sees a picture of a noble and even heroic man, one who clearly has a brain for military and even sometimes political strategy, who hatches incredibly detailed and sophisticated plans but then blows them all in bursts of idiocy. \u00a0</p><p>But what motives lie behind that apparent idiocy? \u00a0That is the crucial question, and one that many viewers have missed, although the answer should surprise no one.</p><p>Every time Ned Stark made a \u201cstupid\u201d decision, it was for one or more of the following three reasons: 1) <b>serving the greater good of the realm</b> (leaving Winterfell to become Robert\u2019s Hand, taking on Littlefinger as a co-conspirator to put Stannis, the rightful heir, on the throne); 2) <b>acting honorably</b> (warning Cersei that he was about to reveal her affair with Jaime); and, most importantly, 3) <b>protecting his family</b>. \u00a0The motives are often intertwined, and sometimes one (such as honor) conflicts with one or more of the others (such as protecting Ned\u2019s family), but every one of the decisions outlined above has involved some combination of these three reasons.</p><p>Twelve-year-old Sansa, of course, could not entirely understand her father\u2019s actions or the complex motivations behind them. \u00a0All she saw was that he screwed up and lost his head for it. \u00a0When she got older, she had more of a capacity to understand why Ned did what he did. \u00a0As she says to Jon in episode 1 of season 7, \u201cHe was trying to protect [his daughters].\u201d \u00a0<b>However, that doesn\u2019t decrease the trauma his death put her through, and she wishes he would have been smarter by listening better to both his own instincts and the wise counsel of his family and friends.</b></p><p>Sound familiar? \u00a0Good. \u00a0Let\u2019s unpack some of Jon\u2019s more questionable decisions from the past two seasons, which parallel his uncle\u2019s to an uncanny degree, and see what his actions and mannerisms tell us about why he made those decisions:</p><p>1.\tHE LIED TO HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND THE WORLD<br>During most of Jon\u2019s scenes with Daenerys, he\u2019s been uncomfortable, stilted, cautious, resigned, and even downright afraid, especially as season 8 has worn on. \u00a0His final \u201cI love you\u201d to her in the early scenes of \u201cThe Bells\u201d is just the latest, but perhaps the most obvious, instance in which he uses what\u2019s left of her romantic feelings for him in a desperate attempt to placate her and de-escalate her more violent tendencies. \u00a0The man is clearly not in love with Daenerys, and, based on his prior interactions with her, he never was (heck, he even looked uncomfortable while having sex with her!) \u2013 although that\u2019s an argument for a different post.</p><p>But Jon never spells this out clearly to either his people (sorry, but \u201cI gave up my crown to protect the North\u201d is an ambiguous allusion, not a specific explanation) or, even more important, his family, whom he loves more than anyone. \u00a0He can bring himself to admit his true parentage to his <strike>siblings </strike>cousins, but not that he deceived Daenerys into thinking he was in love with her. \u00a0Instead, he keeps reciting the tired refrain that \u201cshe\u2019s my queen; she\u2019ll be a good queen; you just don\u2019t know her.\u201d \u00a0Ironically, of course, and as another meta that contrasted Ned\u2019s circumstances with Jon\u2019s noted, his family members could and would help him if only he would ask for it. \u00a0Sansa is a terrific leader with a keen political mind and the clout to call the Northern banners to defend Jon against Daenerys, if she wanted to do it. \u00a0Arya is one hell of a warrior assassin. \u00a0And Bran\u2019s visions, as we\u2019ve seen, can work wonders. \u00a0Furthermore, all three of them are fiercely loyal to him. \u00a0But he still won\u2019t tell them squat about what he fears Daenerys is becoming, and even when Sansa figures it out during the battlements scene with Tyrion, you can see the wheels turning in her head over why the heck Jon didn\u2019t just tell her about it in the first place. </p><p>What an idiot, right? \u00a0But remember Ned Stark\u2019s three main motives behind some of his \u201cstupid\u201d decisions, and you\u2019ll see that Jon truly is his uncle\u2019s nephew. \u00a0Clearly, he sees Daenerys as a threat to the North in general and to his family in particular, especially Sansa (whom Daenerys threatened twice in the first episode alone). \u00a0The fewer people who know Jon\u2019s true feelings about her, the less he has to worry that she\u2019ll hear about them and go Dracarys on the people Jon cares about the most.</p><p>Ned Stark motives #1 and #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>2.\tHE DISREGARDED HIS FAMILY\u2019S WARNINGS AND HEADED STRAIGHT INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE<br>Back in episode 2 of season 7, Sansa and the Northern lords between them listed every possible reason that Jon should rethink his impulsive decision to travel to Dragonstone and form an alliance with a Targaryen who, given the family\u2019s history of madness and violence, might very well either listen to Jon or burn him on the spot. \u00a0Granted, Tyrion Lannister, whom both Jon and Sansa trusted, had vouched for Daenerys, and neither of them particularly wanted Cersei Lannister to stay on the Iron Throne, but to Sansa\u2019s mind, Daenerys was enough of an unknown quantity \u2013 with three dragons to boot \u2013 that Jon should have considered his decision a bit more thoroughly.</p><p>But Jon, like his uncle, had a larger goal in mind that outweighed his desire to stay home with the only family he had. \u00a0Jon\u2019s goal, though, was not the realm\u2019s political stability, but its survival. \u00a0To his mind, the only hope he had of achieving that goal for his people and the people of the other six kingdoms was to bring Daenerys, her armies, her dragons, and her dragonglass back North. \u00a0That much he does admit to Sansa in episode 1 of season 8, but, as she points out, he hadn\u2019t fully considered the price he was paying for her assistance. \u00a0Had he known ahead of time, though, I think our beloved, impulsive hero would have done the same thing all over again. \u00a0To him, every sacrifice he made on Daenerys\u2019s altar was worth it to save his family, the North, and Westeros, in that order.</p><p>Ned Stark motives #1 and #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>3.\tHE DELIBERATELY SHOWED HIS HAND TO HIS ENEMY \u2013 ALL BECAUSE OF HONOR<br>When Jon first met Daenerys, he tried to convince her to join the fight against the White Walkers by every above-board means possible. \u00a0He asked her nicely. \u00a0He showed her evidence to support his claims (depending on what you believe about the cave drawings, but I think they were authentic). \u00a0He offered his support to her claim to the Iron Throne. \u00a0He warned her when he received the raven from Bran indicating that the Night King and his armies were on the way to Eastwatch. \u00a0Only when Daenerys refused beyond all reason to drop her demand that Jon bend the knee did his actions become more underhanded and calculated. \u00a0Only after he realized that his only other option was imprisonment did he agree to the mad idea of the Wight Hunt. \u00a0Only after Cersei had apparently refused to join with them at the dragon pit summit and Daenerys began to waver in her commitment to help save the realm did Jon play the false romance card. \u00a0He did the \u201cdishonorable\u201d thing, as Ned would have put it (sleeping with a woman he had no plans to marry and risking fathering a bastard), only after his attempts at honor, as he saw them, had failed.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #2: CONFIRMED.</p><p>4.\tHE PLOTTED AGAINST THE \u201cQUEEN\u201d OF WESTEROS WITHOUT SEEKING HELP AND COUNSEL FROM HIS FAMILY<br>(Well, he plotted against Cersei Lannister, too, but that was a given from the beginning, so I won\u2019t go into it any further here.)</p><p>By season 8, Jon knows Daenerys Targaryen well enough to be wary of her, at the very least, and by the end of episode 1, he\u2019s clearly beginning to see just how applicable the \u201c-[A]erys\u201d at the end of her name is. \u00a0She threatens Sansa twice. \u00a0Sam tells him that she killed Randyll and Dickon after they had already surrendered on the field of battle. \u00a0She clearly expects the North to kowtow to her and loves it when her dragons frighten them.</p><p>As the season wears on, Daenerys\u2019s paranoia and impulsiveness increase at lightning speed. \u00a0In episode 4 alone, she threatens Sansa for a third time, forces Jon into promising not to tell his own family who he really is, and pressures him to continue his sexual relationship with her even when he doesn\u2019t want to do it. \u00a0Jon clearly sees the writing on the wall at that point, and he finally rebels against her in his own way by breaking his (coerced) promise and telling his cousins that he\u2019s not Ned Stark\u2019s son. \u00a0That would have been the perfect opportunity for him to enlist their help against Daenerys. \u00a0As mentioned above, they all have skill sets that could help him greatly in that endeavor. \u00a0Instead, he decides that it\u2019s more important to \u201cprotect\u201d them by giving them no choice in the matter and separating them from the threat Daenerys has become. \u00a0He swears allegiance once again to the Dragon Queen and heads south at her command with no clear plan to stop her oncoming descent into full-fledged villainy except to talk her out of it, and then maybe deal with any out-of-control actions on her part once Cersei Lannister has been defeated. \u00a0Sigh.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>5.\tHE IGNORED HIS GUT INSTINCTS AND PLACED HIS TRUST IN A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY INDIVIDUAL<br>Even though Jon was the one who insisted on heading off to Dragonstone in season 7 to persuade a completely unknown quantity descended from the craziest, most violent House the Seven Kingdoms have ever had the misfortune to host, he clearly has his reservations about it. \u00a0He\u2019s rightly uneasy when the Dothraki confiscate his ships and weapons, and just as rightly indignant when Daenerys insults him and his family. \u00a0However, he persists in trying to obtain her assistance because she can help him with his goal of defeating the dead, much like Ned thought Littlefinger could help him with his goal of putting the rightful heir on the throne of Westeros. \u00a0He believes, at least for a time, that she\u2019ll be a better choice as an ally than would Cersei Lannister, and that belief makes him overlook warning signal after warning signal: her threat to burn down the Red Keep, her insistence on imprisoning him on Dragonstone until he agrees to go on the wight hunt, her hauling him to King\u2019s Landing against his will, her threats against his family (particularly Sansa) \u2013 all to defeat the dead. \u00a0Until the dead have finally been defeated, and he gets a full view of Daenerys\u2019s true colors, just like Ned Stark got an eyeful of Littlefinger\u2019s. \u00a0</p><p>Ned Stark motive #1: CONFIRMED.</p><p>6.\tHE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE AND LEFT HIS FAMILY FOREVER \u2013 ALL FOR A MINUSCULE CHANCE AT KEEPING SANSA SAFE<br>Jon knew there was a high likelihood that he\u2019d die defending Winterfell against the dead in episode 3, and a similar possibility that he\u2019d die trying to take King\u2019s Landing with Daenerys\u2019s armies in episode 5. \u00a0Dying in episode 3 would have meant dying with some honor in defense of his home, but once he went south to die in episodes 4 and 5, he knew that his options were limited. \u00a0He could either (a) die in the service of a pyromaniac tyrant, or (b) live, but only under the terms she\u2019d dictated to him in episode 4. \u00a0Either way, he knew he might never be able to see his family again, and either way, he\u2019d brought shame and dishonor upon himself and his family. \u00a0As with Ned Stark, the greater shame lay in the second option, which in Jon\u2019s case basically involved being enslaved, sexually and otherwise, to his cruel and unhinged aunt (yes, the great \u201cBreaker of Chains\u201d \u2013 oh, the irony!).</p><p>But instead of rushing forward to his death in King\u2019s Landing, as he had in the Battle of the Bastards, Jon chooses to live. \u00a0He chooses to retreat with as many of his men as he can and risk living a life of slavery and shame. \u00a0If he\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t protect his family. <b>\u00a0He can\u2019t protect Sansa. \u00a0</b>He\u2019s promised to protect her, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s determined to do no matter what the cost \u2013 to his honor, his life, and his soul. \u00a0It\u2019s beautiful, but incredibly tragic.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>So, in the end, was Jon Snow really smarter than his uncle? \u00a0Unlike with Robb, I\u2019d have to say no, and I think that Sansa, even as an adult and with the capacity and insight she now has to understand the proverbial methods behind both men\u2019s madness \u2013 would as well. \u00a0Both men had significant military skills, and both men planned and executed fairly sophisticated schemes. \u00a0And both were willing to protect their families, with a special emphasis on Sansa, no matter what the cost. \u00a0But both had the same fatal flaws: (a) they were a bit too noble in some cases for their own good, (b) they held their cards too close to their chests, and \u00a9 they failed to communicate with and seek the aid of the trustworthy people around them. \u00a0Only good luck \u2013 and the intervention of his family, however much he tried to avoid it \u2013 has kept Jon alive longer than Ned. \u00a0I participated in an interesting Tumblr discussion the other day (which I have tried and failed to track down for reference here), and one of the other posters put the difference between Jon and Ned in an absolutely ingenious way. \u00a0Ned, the poster pointed out, had a \u201cpack\u201d full of children, none of whom could assist him in the way that he needed. \u00a0(I\u2019d add to that assertion that he had a brilliant asset in Cat, but she couldn\u2019t be by his side to advise him moment to moment the way he needed to be advised.) \u00a0But Jon has a \u201cpack\u201d of peers \u2013 fellow young adults with the ability and the influence to help him defeat an enemy he has no hope of taking down on his own. \u00a0I absolutely agree with this, and I think Sansa would too. \u00a0In fact, she\u2019s already correctly guessed (most of) Jon\u2019s reasoning and begun taking matters into her own hands to help him. \u00a0I\u2019d love it if she did even more in the finale, along with Arya and Bran.</p><p>After all, they remember, even if Ned and Jon themselves do not, that <b>the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives</b>. \u00a0They love him even though he\u2019s never been any smarter than Ned. \u00a0(Although, of course, he might do better in the future, after Daenerys has been dealt with, to choose a wife like the wife his father married \u2013 politically smarter than he is, unafraid to tell him the unvarnished truth when he needs it, and, of course, red-headed. \u00a0I don\u2019t think Sansa would mind that,

                "content": "<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d be writing a sequel to my &ldquo;Smarter Than Robb&rdquo; meta (<a href=\"https://geekprincess26.tumblr.com/post/184334232582/smarter-than-robb\">here</a>), especially not on the eve of the series finale of &ldquo;Game of Thrones.&rdquo; &nbsp;However, that was before &ldquo;The Bells&rdquo; (at least in my opinion) broke the show&rsquo;s streak of so-so to awful episodes that started somewhere in season 7. &nbsp;It made me wonder and marvel and gasp and tear up and, above all, think. &nbsp;So did the many articulate posts my fellow Jonsa fans have made about that episode, and in particular about Jon&rsquo;s role both in that segment of the show and in the watershed overwhelming Westeros at the moment. &nbsp;As I rewatched the episode and read people&rsquo;s posts, I began seeing Jon&rsquo;s actions in a slightly different light. &nbsp;Then I realized how similar they were to Ned Stark&rsquo;s doomed efforts to keep his family and the Seven Kingdoms safe and stabilized in season 1.</p><p>Ah, yes, Ned Stark, the original Northern fool &ndash; or, at least, that was how so many people, both on the show and off it, viewed him, much as they later saw his son nephew. &nbsp;And what fools they both were, right? &nbsp;Certainly they were such from a general perspective, but seen from Sansa&rsquo;s viewpoint, many of those actions attained the very height of idiocy. &nbsp;Let us count the ways, starting with Sansa&rsquo;s father, Ned Stark:</p><p>1.\tHE LIED TO HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND THE WORLD <br />He brought a Targaryen heir into his home under the nose of a king who had sworn to eradicate all Targaryens from the face of the earth and claimed that the boy was his bastard, without knowing if Jon would grow up to look like his birth father and therefore clue in Robert &ndash; and the rest of Westeros &ndash; to the truth. &nbsp;He let his own wife think the worst of him, ensuring both a huge strain in their young marriage and her less-than-motherly treatment of poor Jon. &nbsp;<i>What a stubborn, reckless idiot,</i> one could be forgiven for thinking. &nbsp;And what an unnecessary sacrifice of his reputation as a man of honesty and honor, two of the things he valued most.</p><p>2.\tHE DISREGARDED HIS FAMILY&rsquo;S WARNINGS AND HEADED STRAIGHT INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE<br />Many years later, when Jon Arryn died, Robert Baratheon requested that Ned replace the older man as his Hand. &nbsp;Ned, a devoted family man, did not want to leave his family, and especially not to live in King&rsquo;s Landing with its politics and backstabbing. &nbsp;And due to his friendship with Robert, he had a good chance to refuse the other man&rsquo;s offer while keeping his head, family, and honor intact. &nbsp;But Lysa Arryn&rsquo;s raven arrived at Winterfell with its allegations that the Lannisters had murdered her husband. &nbsp;That gave Ned reason to fear for Robert&rsquo;s safety, and so he left his family behind him. &nbsp;No one could fault him for his desire to keep Robert on his throne and avoid another succession conflict, which the Seven Kingdoms could ill afford. &nbsp;However, he could have employed any number of better, smarter options to fulfill that desire, right? &nbsp;How about suggesting another Hand, one who could play the Southern political game more effectively? &nbsp;How about sending ravens to other loyal friends of the king, or even meeting with them in person, to gather more information? &nbsp;Maybe then he could have discovered the truth about Jon Arryn&rsquo;s death before his family antagonized the Lannisters.</p><p>3.\tHE DELIBERATELY SHOWED HIS HAND TO HIS ENEMY &ndash; ALL BECAUSE OF HONOR<br />Speaking of the Lannisters, many would argue that Ned reached the height of his Northern naivet&eacute; in his dealings with them. &nbsp;After all, what kind of idiot would warn the very enemy he&rsquo;s about to rat out to the king? &nbsp;We know that Ned did this with noble intentions. &nbsp;He knew what Robert would do to Cersei and the children once he discovered Jaime&rsquo;s affair with Cersei, and despite his dislike of Cersei, his honor would not allow him to stand by while her children died horrible deaths. &nbsp;Still, if he truly wanted to serve the greater good, could he not have let five lives go for the sake of the greater good? &nbsp;After all, wasn&rsquo;t the greater good the reason he lied to everyone he knew about Jon, as well as his motivation for leaving his family to serve as Robert&rsquo;s Hand?</p><p>4.\tHE PLOTTED AGAINST THE &ldquo;KING&rdquo; OF WESTEROS WITHOUT SEEKING HELP AND COUNSEL FROM HIS FAMILY AND TRUSTWORTHY FRIENDS<br />Not a good idea, right? &nbsp;Especially when that means the continent&rsquo;s second succession crisis in two decades and it&rsquo;s not yet recovered from the first. &nbsp;Ned&rsquo;s eventual aim was honorable and worthy, which helps to justify his dangerous and dishonorable actions, but he could (and should) have sought the advice and support of his wife, who&rsquo;s clearly a canny woman with a lot of connections. &nbsp;Moreover, he probably should have at least considered involving Stark or Tully bannermen whom he knew would be loyal to him, rather than counting on Stannis Baratheon and a motley crew from King&rsquo;s Landing, all of whom had their own agendas.</p><p>Speaking of which&hellip;</p><p>5.\tHE IGNORED HIS GUT INSTINCTS AND PLACED HIS TRUST IN A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY INDIVIDUAL<br />Littlefinger rubbed Ned the wrong way from the day they met. &nbsp;It took less than one episode after that for Ned to slam the snake against the wall of his own brothel by his neck for his perverted remarks about Catelyn, Ned&rsquo;s wife. &nbsp;But Catelyn was convinced that Littlefinger would never harm her and therefore would not want to see any harm come to Ned because she loved Ned so much, so Ned ignored his first instincts &ndash; and Littlefinger&rsquo;s own warnings &ndash; which told him the man was a snake waiting to strike. &nbsp;Instead, he chose to believe that Littlefinger would see the nobility &ndash; or at least the intrigue and the reward &ndash; in Ned&rsquo;s attempts to place the rightful heir on the throne and keep Westeros from being ruled by a beast like Joffrey. &nbsp;But, as Ned found out the hard way, the most sophisticated strategy in the world doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing if you can&rsquo;t trust the people who are supposed to be helping you carry it out.</p><p>6.\tHE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE AND LEFT HIS FAMILY FOREVER &ndash; ALL FOR A MINUSCULE CHANCE AT KEEPING SANSA SAFE<br />Granted, by the time Ned was brought out onto the steps of the Sept of Baelor, his options were very, very limited due to his own deliberate course of action. &nbsp;He knew he would either (a) die, or (b) get sent to the Wall, separated from his family forever. &nbsp;Either way, his life would essentially be over, and he would most likely be declared a traitor to the crown, which meant that unless his son Robb swore fealty to Joffrey (which he likely knew would never happen), his entire family would be considered traitors, and their lands and goods and freedom forfeit to Joffrey (and, by extension, Cersei). &nbsp;Still, dying would be more honorable. &nbsp;Accepting exile to the Wall meant lying abominably to earn a hollow life of shame &ndash; not an action the honorable Ned Stark would have taken lightly. &nbsp;But he did it anyway, because doing it gave his beloved daughter Sansa a better chance at survival. &nbsp;Of course, Ned failed to take into consideration the extent of Joffrey&rsquo;s megalomaniacal cruelty, and he died anyway for his troubles. </p><p>Certainly, many of Ned&rsquo;s actions, when taken at face value, don&rsquo;t look too brilliant. &nbsp;That makes his more intelligent and shrewd deeds, such as the conspiracy to place Stannis on the throne, even more confusing. &nbsp;One sees a picture of a noble and even heroic man, one who clearly has a brain for military and even sometimes political strategy, who hatches incredibly detailed and sophisticated plans but then blows them all in bursts of idiocy. &nbsp;</p><p>But what motives lie behind that apparent idiocy? &nbsp;That is the crucial question, and one that many viewers have missed, although the answer should surprise no one.</p><p>Every time Ned Stark made a &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; decision, it was for one or more of the following three reasons: 1) <b>serving the greater good of the realm</b> (leaving Winterfell to become Robert&rsquo;s Hand, taking on Littlefinger as a co-conspirator to put Stannis, the rightful heir, on the throne); 2) <b>acting honorably</b> (warning Cersei that he was about to reveal her affair with Jaime); and, most importantly, 3) <b>protecting his family</b>. &nbsp;The motives are often intertwined, and sometimes one (such as honor) conflicts with one or more of the others (such as protecting Ned&rsquo;s family), but every one of the decisions outlined above has involved some combination of these three reasons.</p><p>Twelve-year-old Sansa, of course, could not entirely understand her father&rsquo;s actions or the complex motivations behind them. &nbsp;All she saw was that he screwed up and lost his head for it. &nbsp;When she got older, she had more of a capacity to understand why Ned did what he did. &nbsp;As she says to Jon in episode 1 of season 7, &ldquo;He was trying to protect [his daughters].&rdquo; &nbsp;<b>However, that doesn&rsquo;t decrease the trauma his death put her through, and she wishes he would have been smarter by listening better to both his own instincts and the wise counsel of his family and friends.</b></p><p>Sound familiar? &nbsp;Good. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s unpack some of Jon&rsquo;s more questionable decisions from the past two seasons, which parallel his uncle&rsquo;s to an uncanny degree, and see what his actions and mannerisms tell us about why he made those decisions:</p><p>1.\tHE LIED TO HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS, AND THE WORLD<br />During most of Jon&rsquo;s scenes with Daenerys, he&rsquo;s been uncomfortable, stilted, cautious, resigned, and even downright afraid, especially as season 8 has worn on. &nbsp;His final &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; to her in the early scenes of &ldquo;The Bells&rdquo; is just the latest, but perhaps the most obvious, instance in which he uses what&rsquo;s left of her romantic feelings for him in a desperate attempt to placate her and de-escalate her more violent tendencies. &nbsp;The man is clearly not in love with Daenerys, and, based on his prior interactions with her, he never was (heck, he even looked uncomfortable while having sex with her!) &ndash; although that&rsquo;s an argument for a different post.</p><p>But Jon never spells this out clearly to either his people (sorry, but &ldquo;I gave up my crown to protect the North&rdquo; is an ambiguous allusion, not a specific explanation) or, even more important, his family, whom he loves more than anyone. &nbsp;He can bring himself to admit his true parentage to his <strike>siblings </strike>cousins, but not that he deceived Daenerys into thinking he was in love with her. &nbsp;Instead, he keeps reciting the tired refrain that &ldquo;she&rsquo;s my queen; she&rsquo;ll be a good queen; you just don&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo; &nbsp;Ironically, of course, and as another meta that contrasted Ned&rsquo;s circumstances with Jon&rsquo;s noted, his family members could and would help him if only he would ask for it. &nbsp;Sansa is a terrific leader with a keen political mind and the clout to call the Northern banners to defend Jon against Daenerys, if she wanted to do it. &nbsp;Arya is one hell of a warrior assassin. &nbsp;And Bran&rsquo;s visions, as we&rsquo;ve seen, can work wonders. &nbsp;Furthermore, all three of them are fiercely loyal to him. &nbsp;But he still won&rsquo;t tell them squat about what he fears Daenerys is becoming, and even when Sansa figures it out during the battlements scene with Tyrion, you can see the wheels turning in her head over why the heck Jon didn&rsquo;t just tell her about it in the first place. </p><p>What an idiot, right? &nbsp;But remember Ned Stark&rsquo;s three main motives behind some of his &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; decisions, and you&rsquo;ll see that Jon truly is his uncle&rsquo;s nephew. &nbsp;Clearly, he sees Daenerys as a threat to the North in general and to his family in particular, especially Sansa (whom Daenerys threatened twice in the first episode alone). &nbsp;The fewer people who know Jon&rsquo;s true feelings about her, the less he has to worry that she&rsquo;ll hear about them and go Dracarys on the people Jon cares about the most.</p><p>Ned Stark motives #1 and #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>2.\tHE DISREGARDED HIS FAMILY&rsquo;S WARNINGS AND HEADED STRAIGHT INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE<br />Back in episode 2 of season 7, Sansa and the Northern lords between them listed every possible reason that Jon should rethink his impulsive decision to travel to Dragonstone and form an alliance with a Targaryen who, given the family&rsquo;s history of madness and violence, might very well either listen to Jon or burn him on the spot. &nbsp;Granted, Tyrion Lannister, whom both Jon and Sansa trusted, had vouched for Daenerys, and neither of them particularly wanted Cersei Lannister to stay on the Iron Throne, but to Sansa&rsquo;s mind, Daenerys was enough of an unknown quantity &ndash; with three dragons to boot &ndash; that Jon should have considered his decision a bit more thoroughly.</p><p>But Jon, like his uncle, had a larger goal in mind that outweighed his desire to stay home with the only family he had. &nbsp;Jon&rsquo;s goal, though, was not the realm&rsquo;s political stability, but its survival. &nbsp;To his mind, the only hope he had of achieving that goal for his people and the people of the other six kingdoms was to bring Daenerys, her armies, her dragons, and her dragonglass back North. &nbsp;That much he does admit to Sansa in episode 1 of season 8, but, as she points out, he hadn&rsquo;t fully considered the price he was paying for her assistance. &nbsp;Had he known ahead of time, though, I think our beloved, impulsive hero would have done the same thing all over again. &nbsp;To him, every sacrifice he made on Daenerys&rsquo;s altar was worth it to save his family, the North, and Westeros, in that order.</p><p>Ned Stark motives #1 and #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>3.\tHE DELIBERATELY SHOWED HIS HAND TO HIS ENEMY &ndash; ALL BECAUSE OF HONOR<br />When Jon first met Daenerys, he tried to convince her to join the fight against the White Walkers by every above-board means possible. &nbsp;He asked her nicely. &nbsp;He showed her evidence to support his claims (depending on what you believe about the cave drawings, but I think they were authentic). &nbsp;He offered his support to her claim to the Iron Throne. &nbsp;He warned her when he received the raven from Bran indicating that the Night King and his armies were on the way to Eastwatch. &nbsp;Only when Daenerys refused beyond all reason to drop her demand that Jon bend the knee did his actions become more underhanded and calculated. &nbsp;Only after he realized that his only other option was imprisonment did he agree to the mad idea of the Wight Hunt. &nbsp;Only after Cersei had apparently refused to join with them at the dragon pit summit and Daenerys began to waver in her commitment to help save the realm did Jon play the false romance card. &nbsp;He did the &ldquo;dishonorable&rdquo; thing, as Ned would have put it (sleeping with a woman he had no plans to marry and risking fathering a bastard), only after his attempts at honor, as he saw them, had failed.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #2: CONFIRMED.</p><p>4.\tHE PLOTTED AGAINST THE &ldquo;QUEEN&rdquo; OF WESTEROS WITHOUT SEEKING HELP AND COUNSEL FROM HIS FAMILY<br />(Well, he plotted against Cersei Lannister, too, but that was a given from the beginning, so I won&rsquo;t go into it any further here.)</p><p>By season 8, Jon knows Daenerys Targaryen well enough to be wary of her, at the very least, and by the end of episode 1, he&rsquo;s clearly beginning to see just how applicable the &ldquo;-[A]erys&rdquo; at the end of her name is. &nbsp;She threatens Sansa twice. &nbsp;Sam tells him that she killed Randyll and Dickon after they had already surrendered on the field of battle. &nbsp;She clearly expects the North to kowtow to her and loves it when her dragons frighten them.</p><p>As the season wears on, Daenerys&rsquo;s paranoia and impulsiveness increase at lightning speed. &nbsp;In episode 4 alone, she threatens Sansa for a third time, forces Jon into promising not to tell his own family who he really is, and pressures him to continue his sexual relationship with her even when he doesn&rsquo;t want to do it. &nbsp;Jon clearly sees the writing on the wall at that point, and he finally rebels against her in his own way by breaking his (coerced) promise and telling his cousins that he&rsquo;s not Ned Stark&rsquo;s son. &nbsp;That would have been the perfect opportunity for him to enlist their help against Daenerys. &nbsp;As mentioned above, they all have skill sets that could help him greatly in that endeavor. &nbsp;Instead, he decides that it&rsquo;s more important to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; them by giving them no choice in the matter and separating them from the threat Daenerys has become. &nbsp;He swears allegiance once again to the Dragon Queen and heads south at her command with no clear plan to stop her oncoming descent into full-fledged villainy except to talk her out of it, and then maybe deal with any out-of-control actions on her part once Cersei Lannister has been defeated. &nbsp;Sigh.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>5.\tHE IGNORED HIS GUT INSTINCTS AND PLACED HIS TRUST IN A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY INDIVIDUAL<br />Even though Jon was the one who insisted on heading off to Dragonstone in season 7 to persuade a completely unknown quantity descended from the craziest, most violent House the Seven Kingdoms have ever had the misfortune to host, he clearly has his reservations about it. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s rightly uneasy when the Dothraki confiscate his ships and weapons, and just as rightly indignant when Daenerys insults him and his family. &nbsp;However, he persists in trying to obtain her assistance because she can help him with his goal of defeating the dead, much like Ned thought Littlefinger could help him with his goal of putting the rightful heir on the throne of Westeros. &nbsp;He believes, at least for a time, that she&rsquo;ll be a better choice as an ally than would Cersei Lannister, and that belief makes him overlook warning signal after warning signal: her threat to burn down the Red Keep, her insistence on imprisoning him on Dragonstone until he agrees to go on the wight hunt, her hauling him to King&rsquo;s Landing against his will, her threats against his family (particularly Sansa) &ndash; all to defeat the dead. &nbsp;Until the dead have finally been defeated, and he gets a full view of Daenerys&rsquo;s true colors, just like Ned Stark got an eyeful of Littlefinger&rsquo;s. &nbsp;</p><p>Ned Stark motive #1: CONFIRMED.</p><p>6.\tHE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE AND LEFT HIS FAMILY FOREVER &ndash; ALL FOR A MINUSCULE CHANCE AT KEEPING SANSA SAFE<br />Jon knew there was a high likelihood that he&rsquo;d die defending Winterfell against the dead in episode 3, and a similar possibility that he&rsquo;d die trying to take King&rsquo;s Landing with Daenerys&rsquo;s armies in episode 5. &nbsp;Dying in episode 3 would have meant dying with some honor in defense of his home, but once he went south to die in episodes 4 and 5, he knew that his options were limited. &nbsp;He could either (a) die in the service of a pyromaniac tyrant, or (b) live, but only under the terms she&rsquo;d dictated to him in episode 4. &nbsp;Either way, he knew he might never be able to see his family again, and either way, he&rsquo;d brought shame and dishonor upon himself and his family. &nbsp;As with Ned Stark, the greater shame lay in the second option, which in Jon&rsquo;s case basically involved being enslaved, sexually and otherwise, to his cruel and unhinged aunt (yes, the great &ldquo;Breaker of Chains&rdquo; &ndash; oh, the irony!).</p><p>But instead of rushing forward to his death in King&rsquo;s Landing, as he had in the Battle of the Bastards, Jon chooses to live. &nbsp;He chooses to retreat with as many of his men as he can and risk living a life of slavery and shame. &nbsp;If he&rsquo;s dead, he can&rsquo;t protect his family. <b>&nbsp;He can&rsquo;t protect Sansa. &nbsp;</b>He&rsquo;s promised to protect her, and that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s determined to do no matter what the cost &ndash; to his honor, his life, and his soul. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s beautiful, but incredibly tragic.</p><p>Ned Stark motive #3: CONFIRMED.</p><p>So, in the end, was Jon Snow really smarter than his uncle? &nbsp;Unlike with Robb, I&rsquo;d have to say no, and I think that Sansa, even as an adult and with the capacity and insight she now has to understand the proverbial methods behind both men&rsquo;s madness &ndash; would as well. &nbsp;Both men had significant military skills, and both men planned and executed fairly sophisticated schemes. &nbsp;And both were willing to protect their families, with a special emphasis on Sansa, no matter what the cost. &nbsp;But both had the same fatal flaws: (a) they were a bit too noble in some cases for their own good, (b) they held their cards too close to their chests, and &copy; they failed to communicate with and seek the aid of the trustworthy people around them. &nbsp;Only good luck &ndash; and the intervention of his family, however much he tried to avoid it &ndash; has kept Jon alive longer than Ned. &nbsp;I participated in an interesting Tumblr discussion the other day (which I have tried and failed to track down for reference here), and one of the other posters put the difference between Jon and Ned in an absolutely ingenious way. &nbsp;Ned, the poster pointed out, had a &ldquo;pack&rdquo; full of children, none of whom could assist him in the way that he needed. &nbsp;(I&rsquo;d add to that assertion that he had a brilliant asset in Cat, but she couldn&rsquo;t be by his side to advise him moment to moment the way he needed to be advised.) &nbsp;But Jon has a &ldquo;pack&rdquo; of peers &ndash; fellow young adults with the ability and the influence to help him defeat an enemy he has no hope of taking down on his own. &nbsp;I absolutely agree with this, and I think Sansa would too. &nbsp;In fact, she&rsquo;s already correctly guessed (most of) Jon&rsquo;s reasoning and begun taking matters into her own hands to help him. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d love it if she did even more in the finale, along with Arya and Bran.</p><p>After all, they remember, even if Ned and Jon themselves do not, that <b>the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives</b>. &nbsp;They love him even though he&rsquo;s never been any smarter than Ned. &nbsp;(Although, of course, he might do better in the future, after Daenerys has been dealt with, to choose a wife like the wife his father married &ndash; politically smarter than he is, unafraid to tell him the unvarnished truth when he needs it, and, of course, red-headed. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think Sansa would mind that, either.)<br /></p>",
