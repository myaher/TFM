        "body": "<h1>For Stan</h1><p>Exterior Avengers tower</p><p>Snap to interior: Spider-Man is being put through the paces in a training room swinging around and webbing up small sentry drones.</p><p>Looking down we see Tony Stark \u00a0excitedly shouting orders and cheering on the swinging heroe above. Standing next to him we see Captain America with his hood down, arms crossed, beaming up at Peter as well.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s web is severed by a bladed sentry sending him tumbling in front of Tony and Steve landing in a humorous looking heap. Tony openly laughs at the fall Peter has taken while a smiling Steve shakes his head and goes to help up his friend.</p><p>Tony begins typing away at a terminal (presumably setting up another training exercise) behind him we see a pin prick of orange light grow to become a great shining circle out which steps Doctor Stephen Strange. He seems somber, staring at the ground while stepping out of his portal. Looking up and seeing a laughing Steve Rogers and now unmasked Peter laughing as well his somber look is softened someone letting a small smirk shine through.</p><p>Approaching the group Peter is the first to notice Strange and waves animatedly in greeting, Steve and Tony notice as well and smile in greeting. Strange looks at them with a smile that doesn\u2019t quite meet his eyes and gestures them to come join him through the portal. Stopping them just before entering. Looking them over he waves his hand and changing their clothing into pristine looking black tuxedos. Strange does the same to himself and gestures the group to follow him to follow him. They all enter the portal.</p><p>They all come out into a low lit room. The group looks around trying to discern where they are. The room is full of sad looking people all dressed in black. Peter bumps into one woman and goes to apologize only to realize she doesnt move to respond, or blink, or do anything at all. Peter looks to Tony and Steve observing a man seeming to be frozen in time in the middle of blowing his nose. Strange gets all their attention and gestures to the far end of the room. There is a line of people all dressed in black lining up to pay their respects to a casket at the far end of the room. The room suddenly snaps to life and the group hurriedly joins the cue to pay their own respects. They each seem confused but go and politely pay their respects. As they approach the casket they seem strangely&hellip;sad, and can&rsquo;t quite discern why.</p><p>Each one takes turns paying respects to casketn Tony stands politely with tears in the corners of his eyes. Steve kneels and says a prayer. Peter unsure of what to makes the sign of the cross and moves on, visibly having a harder time holding back tears than the others. Strange gestures for them to follow him outside.</p><p>Exiting the building the building the heroes notice leaning against the building are piles, heaps, and small mountains of dolls, stuffed animals, posters, and action figures seemingly in offering to whomever this funeral is for. Approaching the piles they see some of these are them! Steve finds a plastic version of his shield. Tony spots a little Iron man action. Peter sees a little plushie version of Spider-Man. Looking about they see even more toys, paintings, and all manner of things with there visages and those of other heroes they know, and some they don&rsquo;t recognize. They look around and see swaths and swaths of people coming to add to the offerings.</p><p>A little girl walks by Peter while he&rsquo;s kneeling down inspecting a Hulk doll. She&rsquo;s wearing a Spider-Man tshirt and carrying a little stuffed animal. She bends down to add her offering to the pile: a teddy bear in a red cape, with an \u201cS\u201d on the chest. Peter looks at it and seems to recognize it for a moment. He looks up and meets the little girls gaze. He smiles and gives a small wave. The girl\u2019s eyes go wide in a look of recognition. Smiling and laughing she begins tottering towards Peter with her arms out when suddenly time seems to freeze again. She is stuck and everyone but the heroes cannot move. They all look towards Strange quizzically. Strange shrugs his shoulders in a look of mutual confusion. A flash of light from inside draws their eyes, and they all run in to investigate.</p><p>Running into the building the group sees a similar portal to that which Strange summoned. Stepping out of it are 3 individuals. Two men and a woman. Both men are tall and handsome, one with incredibly manicured hair, the other with somewhat disheveled hair and a single curl coming down the center of his hairline. The disheveled man is also bespectacled. The women is tall with long ebony black hair, and muscular arms. We as readers will recognize these 3 as Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Diana Prince. They have come to pay their respects. They each offer their respects and come towards Tony, Steve, and Peter they all shake hands and enjoy pleasantries. The world seems to unfreeze and the new group of heroes goes out front. Tony and Peter point out to the new comers all the gifts people have brought to the funeral. Clark bends down to pick up the teddy bear the girl put down earlier. Showing it to Peter he also undoes a few buttons on his tux to reveal the matching \u201cS\u201d under his own shirt. Peter gets a look of elation and in the background we can see Bruce and Tony conversing, as well as Steve Chatting with Diana.</p><p>A montage follows of the heroes walking around speaking with each other, laughing, and sharing stories. They get food, the walk around a nearby lake, Peter even plays frisbee with Diana with a Batman frisbee they found, which goes wide and lightly baps Bruce in the side of the head, and finally return to the funeral. It\u2019s dusk and the guests have left. \u00a0We see the heroes lined up. Tony shaking Bruce\u2019s hand, Clark shaking Steves, and Diana giving Peter a big hug. A portal opens and Strange walks out beckoning them in. They all enter one by one, Peter stops for a moment and turns back to look at the portrait next to the casket which we had not seen yet until now. A young man with tinted glasses, a bushy mustache, and a wry smile stairs out from the portrait. Stan Lee. Peter bows his head, closes his eyes, looks up once more to the portrait of the man who gave him life in this world. \u201cExcelsior.\u201d he says before turning back and walking through the portal, back to his own world.</p><p>Thank you Stan</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"345\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"danks-gif:4QKnDEEP71P5u2wM-ZNXAA:ZKg-Af2dhKIDo\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdd4524365ad9515588be4dadf7be180/tumblr_pi3h9nHFwt1w0433po1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"345\" data-orig-width=\"480\"/></figure>",

Standing next to him we see Captain America with his hood down, arms crossed, beaming up at Peter as well.</p><p>Peter\u2019s web is severed by a bladed sentry sending him tumbling in front of Tony and Steve landing in a humorous looking heap. Tony openly laughs at the fall Peter has taken while a smiling Steve shakes his head and goes to help up his friend.</p><p>Tony begins typing away at a terminal (presumably setting up another training exercise) behind him we see a pin prick of orange light grow to become a great shining circle out which steps Doctor Stephen Strange. He seems somber, staring at the ground while stepping out of his portal. Looking up and seeing a laughing Steve Rogers and now unmasked Peter laughing as well his somber look is softened someone letting a small smirk shine through.</p><p>Approaching the group Peter is the first to notice Strange and waves animatedly in greeting, Steve and Tony notice as well and smile in greeting. Strange looks at them with a smile that doesn\u2019t quite meet his eyes and gestures them to come join him through the portal. Stopping them just before entering. Looking them over he waves his hand and changing their clothing into pristine looking black tuxedos. Strange does the same to himself and gestures the group to follow him to follow him. They all enter the portal.</p><p>They all come out into a low lit room. The group looks around trying to discern where they are. The room is full of sad looking people all dressed in black. Peter bumps into one woman and goes to apologize only to realize she doesnt move to respond, or blink, or do anything at all. Peter looks to Tony and Steve observing a man seeming to be frozen in time in the middle of blowing his nose. Strange gets all their attention and gestures to the far end of the room. There is a line of people all dressed in black lining up to pay their respects to a casket at the far end of the room. The room suddenly snaps to life and the group hurriedly joins the cue to pay their own respects. They each seem confused but go and politely pay their respects. As they approach the casket they seem strangely\u2026sad, and can\u2019t quite discern why.</p><p>Each one takes turns paying respects to casketn Tony stands politely with tears in the corners of his eyes. Steve kneels and says a prayer. Peter unsure of what to makes the sign of the cross and moves on, visibly having a harder time holding back tears than the others. Strange gestures for them to follow him outside.</p><p>Exiting the building the building the heroes notice leaning against the building are piles, heaps, and small mountains of dolls, stuffed animals, posters, and action figures seemingly in offering to whomever this funeral is for. Approaching the piles they see some of these are them! Steve finds a plastic version of his shield. Tony spots a little Iron man action. Peter sees a little plushie version of Spider-Man. Looking about they see even more toys, paintings, and all manner of things with there visages and those of other heroes they know, and some they don\u2019t recognize. They look around and see swaths and swaths of people coming to add to the offerings.</p><p>A little girl walks by Peter while he\u2019s kneeling down inspecting a Hulk doll. She\u2019s wearing a Spider-Man tshirt and carrying a little stuffed animal. She bends down to add her offering to the pile: a teddy bear in a red cape, with an \u201cS\u201d on the chest. Peter looks at it and seems to recognize it for a moment. He looks up and meets the little girls gaze. He smiles and gives a small wave. The girl\u2019s eyes go wide in a look of recognition. Smiling and laughing she begins tottering towards Peter with her arms out when suddenly time seems to freeze again. She is stuck and everyone but the heroes cannot move. They all look towards Strange quizzically. Strange shrugs his shoulders in a look of mutual confusion. A flash of light from inside draws their eyes, and they all run in to investigate.</p><p>Running into the building the group sees a similar portal to that which Strange summoned. Stepping out of it are 3 individuals. Two men and a woman. Both men are tall and handsome, one with incredibly manicured hair, the other with somewhat disheveled hair and a single curl coming down the center of his hairline. The disheveled man is also bespectacled. The women is tall with long ebony black hair, and muscular arms. We as readers will recognize these 3 as Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Diana Prince. They have come to pay their respects. They each offer their respects and come towards Tony, Steve, and Peter they all shake hands and enjoy pleasantries. The world seems to unfreeze and the new group of heroes goes out front. Tony and Peter point out to the new comers all the gifts people have brought to the funeral. Clark bends down to pick up the teddy bear the girl put down earlier. Showing it to Peter he also undoes a few buttons on his tux to reveal the matching \u201cS\u201d under his own shirt. Peter gets a look of elation and in the background we can see Bruce and Tony conversing, as well as Steve Chatting with Diana.</p><p>A montage follows of the heroes walking around speaking with each other, laughing, and sharing stories. They get food, the walk around a nearby lake, Peter even plays frisbee with Diana with a Batman frisbee they found, which goes wide and lightly baps Bruce in the side of the head, and finally return to the funeral. It\u2019s dusk and the guests have left. \u00a0We see the heroes lined up. Tony shaking Bruce\u2019s hand, Clark shaking Steves, and Diana giving Peter a big hug. A portal opens and Strange walks out beckoning them in. They all enter one by one, Peter stops for a moment and turns back to look at the portrait next to the casket which we had not seen yet until now. A young man with tinted glasses, a bushy mustache, and a wry smile stairs out from the portrait. Stan Lee. Peter bows his head, closes his eyes, looks up once more to the portrait of the man who gave him life in this world. \u201cExcelsior.\u201d he says before turning back and walking through the portal, back to his own world.</p><p>Thank you Stan</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"345\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"danks-gif:4QKnDEEP71P5u2wM-ZNXAA:ZKg-Af2dhKIDo\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdd4524365ad9515588be4dadf7be180/tumblr_pi3h9nHFwt1w0433po1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"345\" data-orig-width=\"480\"></figure></p>",
