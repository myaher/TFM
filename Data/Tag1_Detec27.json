I don\u2019t care if the plot was predictable or anything (besides, I did kind of minorly spoil it for myself, anyway\u2014though I did not know that Ditto was masquerading as Roger!), it was cute, I personally think the acting was great, I had fun, that\u2019s what I care about. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling both during the movie and after.</p><p>Now, since I don\u2019t know the game, I don\u2019t know how much the plot was changed or anything, but from what I\u2019ve seen second hand, it seems like it was largely the same basic premise, w/ some alterations. Like Psyduck.</p><p>Praised be whoever decided to include Psyduck. TT^TT MY BABY.<br>(Don\u2019t get me wrong, Pikachu was ADORABLE, I\u2019m just a die-hard Psyduck fan.

There\u2019s no way to know, but his voice acting was great regardless.</p><p>Mewtwo looked a little weird, sure, but I expected that\u2014and you know what, I actually <b>LOVED\u00a0</b>them. I think having it be the same Mewtwo and having them already\u00a0\u2018chilled out\u2019 (for lack of a better word) to some degree was a good choice. I loved them as the aloof, but still ultimately benevolent type. I was literally no pissed of at Howard (and his Ditto) for putting them through that. Literally, when the Ditto\u00a1Roger appeared w/ electrical traps, and Metwo was clearly in pain, I was almost shrieking at the screen for them to leave Mewtwo alone and stop hurting them.

If that makes sense.</p><p>I loved all the Pok\u00e9mon cameos. They did go for the \u2018staples\u2019 a lot, but I think that may have been an attempt to\u00a0\u2018keep it simple\u2019 and stick w/ some of the more recognisable ones for people who might not be long time fans etc. which is fine by me. They did take moments to include some of the more unique Pok\u00e9mon, too. I don\u2019t have complete knowledge of all Pok\u00e9mon generations or anything, but it occurred to me, maybe they were also mostly going w/ Pok\u00e9mon that were out at the time the game came out? On top of that, several of the more recent games are treated as being set in kind of distant locations\u2014even giving localisation, an easy handwave is that those regional Pok\u00e9mon/specific evolutions just haven\u2019t yet made it to where Ryme City is.<br>Plus\u2026 God, how many Pok\u00e9mon are there now? Even just the first generation was 151, right? No way in heck were they gonna fit every single one into the movie.
