                "content": "<p>&ldquo;This is&hellip;&rdquo; Momo stared uneasily at the station, as though it were a haunted house.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My birthday wish. Yes,&rdquo; Todoroki responded.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is there some food in there you like, or are we going somewhere else? I can call for a ride &ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re going to take a train. Come on.&rdquo; Todoroki pulled Momo by the hand.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Shoto! I don&rsquo;t &ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Feel comfortable? Of course not. I&rsquo;d feel uncomfortable if I had to do something for the first time. But you said, and I quote,&nbsp;&lsquo;we can go anywhere&rsquo; for my birthday, so here we are.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I really regret promising that.&rdquo; Momo pouted, and his lip curled into a smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s late, so no one will be taking it. No one will witness your embarrassment.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Shoto!&rdquo; She slapped his shoulder, but as always, he didn&rsquo;t even wince, dragging her to the ticket machine against her feeble protests.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, pick your stop,&rdquo; Todoroki instructed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Momo sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just for you&hellip;and just this once, deal?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hmmph.&rdquo; Momo scanned the map for her prefecture. &ldquo;Aichi&hellip;Aichi&hellip;Aichi&hellip;&rdquo; She muttered, waving her finger around to find the word.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh for crying out &ndash; Here,&rdquo; Shoto sighed and pressed on the station that she&rsquo;d been searching for.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I would have found that,&rdquo; Momo defended.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure&hellip;&rdquo; Shoto replied with a tone of sarcasm he didn&rsquo;t even try to conceal.&nbsp;&ldquo;Anyway, pay up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Momo dug into her jacket and pulled out her wallet.&nbsp;&ldquo;200 Yen? That&rsquo;s cheap.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it is. That&rsquo;s the whole point.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Momo stuck her tongue out at him, and Shoto smiled at that. Knowing her, she wouldn&rsquo;t have done that if they were in a crowded place. Currently, only a few people were still out and about at this time of the night, and Momo had definitely changed in the year and a half that they&rsquo;ve been dating.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mom would pinch you for that,&rdquo; He teased.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s not here, is she?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He liked rebellious Momo.&nbsp;</p><p>Once they paid for the tickets, they went up to the gantry.&nbsp;&ldquo;So you insert the ticket into here, and then take the stub out here.&rdquo; He pointed at the respective slots.&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, when you exit, you put the stub here and walk through.&rdquo;</p><p>He proceeded to demonstrate it, ending up on the opposite side of the gantry, leaving Momo behind and extremely confused.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I just jump over it?&rdquo; She suggested, half-joking.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh hurry up, or we&rsquo;re going to miss the train.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She vaguely remembered what Todoroki said a few seconds ago, and like a child inserting blocks in the form of shapes into their respective holes for the first time, managed to awkwardly bypass the gantry after a moment of deep thought.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So glad you made it, or you would&rsquo;ve been stranded there forever.&rdquo; Shoto said in a sardonic tone.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Shush,&rdquo; Momo warned, and Todoroki obeyed, albeit chuckling lightly. They went up the escalator holding hands.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know, people on the right generally walk up.&rdquo; Shoto pointed out<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know how escalator etiquette works, thank you very much. But there&rsquo;s no one here, so there!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The platform was empty, apart from one drunkard at the other end sleeping on a bench, so the couple was alone. They sat down on a bench and enjoyed a comfortable silence in the chilly night, occasionally broken by the unexpectedly loud snores of the drunk guy or the announcements over the intercom.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the train arrived, and the two boarded it. To no one&rsquo;s surprise, it was empty. At least, that carriage was. Shoto spotted a few others scattered throughout the train in other carriages, but they were either sleeping or engrossed in their own things.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Momo zipped up her jacket suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;Cold?&rdquo; Todoroki asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Momo replied, shivering slightly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so stubborn.&rdquo; He wrapped his left arm around her neck and heated it up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna get &ndash;&rdquo; Momo yawned at the warmth.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sleepy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a 20 minute ride anyway.
