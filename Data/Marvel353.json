You loved water and loved to be at the beach during the summers you spent with your family. </b></i></p><p><i><b>But this time it was different. Something was really off. </b></i></p><p><i><b>You didn\u2019t remember how or when you got there, or when. Just that something was wrong. You were under water and it was really dark. The only light piercing through underneath the dark surface was the pale glow the moon gave and it wasn\u2019t much. You looked up, towards the surface and began to swim up. It didn\u2019t work\u2014 you stayed exactly where you were. </b></i></p><p><i><b>Something was moving in the dark. Once again, you were completely clueless as to what it was, but you hoped and told a silent prayer that it wouldn\u2019t harm you. \u00a0Suddenly, a huge white tail surrounded you. Unable to move, you stared at it in shock. The tail moved in front of you, and from the darkness a creature\u2019s face appeared. It had no eyes, no ears, no nose, only a huge mouth. It had two giant arms with thin, pointy fingers.</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201dY/N.\u201d, it cooed. How did it even know your name? \u201dI know what you did.\u201d, the creature was smiling now, its\u2019 yellow and dangerously sharp teeth showing. \u201dAll those people who were sacrificed to make you who you are today.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>You tried to open your mouth, but it was of no use. \u201dLook at them Y/N!\u201d, the creature grumbled. One of its\u2019 hands was around you now, the other one pointing towards something. \u201dI said look at them!\u201d, it roared. You did as you were told, you looked. There were people floating in the water, people you knew. All people who ever meant something to you. </b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201dYou made this! This was YOUR fault!\u201d<br/>\nWater was entering through your nose now and you looked at the creature in panic. \u201dThat\u2019s right Y/N. Pay for what you\u2019ve done!\u201d, the grip it had tightened around your waist. \u201dSuffer, like they did.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>You looked up to see your best friend\u2019s lifeless body. They stared right at you with cold, dead eyes. The water was burning your chest as it entered your lungs and soon enough everything around you went black.</b></i></p><p>You woke up with sweat dripping off your forehead with a heart throbbing, feeling like someone was pounding your chest with a hammer with every heart beat.

Pay for what you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo;, the grip it had tightened around your waist. &rdquo;Suffer, like they did.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>You looked up to see your best friend&rsquo;s lifeless body. They stared right at you with cold, dead eyes. The water was burning your chest as it entered your lungs and soon enough everything around you went black.</b></i></p><p>You woke up with sweat dripping off your forehead with a heart throbbing, feeling like someone was pounding your chest with a hammer with every heart beat. You got up from your bed, walking across the dark room, still shocked about the dream you just had. You went to open your bedroom door but ended up falling to the floor with a huge thud. You looked up towards the door and crawled to the wall, where you eventually curled up and started to cry.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know how long you have been there when there were a few loud taps on your door. You didn&rsquo;t bother to answer the door, so the person on the other side opened the door. <br />\n&rdquo;Y/N? Darling, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;, Steve asked softly. You looked up at him, eyes puffy and filled with tears. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, I will be alright.&rdquo;, you sniffled and managed to dry your tears in your sleeve.</p><p>&rdquo;Hey.&rdquo;, he said and sat down next to you. He took your hand. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t want to tell me, but I get worried when you&rsquo;re up in the middle of the night, crying. But please at least let me stay here with you during the night so I know you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;, he said as he squeezed your hand. You started crying again. Steve got closer to you, and brought you into his arms. He was wearing a long-sleeved, tight blue shirt which was made of a soft fabric. &rdquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;, he whispered and caressed your back. &rdquo;You&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;They all died because of me! I was supposed to die, like the creature said!&rdquo;, you sobbed. </p><p>&rdquo;What creature?&rdquo;, Steve&rsquo;s eyebrows knitted together. You continued to sob into his chest. &rdquo;Darling, what creature?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;The one in my dream! It held me tight around my waist and showed me everyone that has died around me. It said it was my fault, and for that I was gonna pay. So I drowned.&rdquo;, you wept, barely being able to breathe from being too upset.</p><p>&rdquo;Breathe doll, breathe. Please.&rdquo;, he hushed. &rdquo;Breathe with me okay? Breathe in.&rdquo;, his chest raised up and you shakily inhaled too. &rdquo;And out.&rdquo;, his chest now lowered and so did yours. &rdquo;You&rsquo;re doing great darling, let&rsquo;s do it again.&rdquo; </p><p>And so you did, a few more times. </p><p>&rdquo;Thank you.&rdquo;, you mumbled tiredly.</p><p>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s completely alright. I&rsquo;m staying with you tonight.&rdquo;, he said as he continued to caress your back. You just nodded. </p><p>&rdquo;Alright darling, let&rsquo;s go to bed.&rdquo;, Steve murmured as he kissed the top of your head. He helped you up and led you to bed. </p><p>He tucked you in and got under the covers next to you and you cuddled into him. &rdquo;Thank you darling, honestly.&rdquo;, you said as you pecked his lips.</p><p>&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, doll.&rdquo;, he said softly as he kissed you once more. &rdquo;Get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>",
