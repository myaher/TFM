I wished it really yelled in pain, but unfortunately, the one yelling in pain was me, jumping on my tiptoes, rubbing my red knuckles.<br/>&ldquo;Hey, Hey are you okay?&rdquo; Peter jumped in, soothing my hand.<br/>&ldquo;I guess Hulk wasn&rsquo;t that angry today.&rdquo; I laughed at his super cute, protective nature.</p><p>Peter helped me with my flying skills, by making me support cables using his web, so that I don&rsquo;t die falling down. Flying was a lot better than punching skills.</p><p>Skills always get better with time and practice. And a good partner always makes the process easier and interesting&hellip; A partner likes Pete.</p><p>After 14 days of practice, I could say that I&rsquo;m not that bad after all.<br/>We were sitting on the edge of the same building we sat the first time we met. He had his mask off and a small notebook in his hand with a pencil.</p><p>&ldquo;Flight skills: check\u00a0<br/>Ring control: double check\u00a0<br/>Dodge skills: decent\u00a0<br/>Fighting skills: gross, sorry to say, but no scope for improvement.&rdquo;, <br/>he narrated while ticking or crossing off the check-boxes, like he was a professional trainer. What a dramatic boy&hellip; Shutting his notebook and keeping the pencil down, he faced me giving a weak smile. But I grabbed - more like snatched, both the notebook and the pencil turning it to the same &lsquo;result&rsquo; page.</p><p>&ldquo;Intelligence and observation level to expose the 'secret identity&rsquo; of a 'dumbo&rsquo; nerd in just the first week of encounter&hellip;&hellip;Triple check.&rdquo;<br/>I concluded, scribbling in his notebook.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, we were already done with 'me being dumb and bad at keeping secrets&rsquo; a long time ago.&rdquo; He said, sounding frustrated as he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we?&rdquo; I said with narrowing eyes as I stood up and grabbed the pack of churros from the lunch he brought&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; He hesitated, trying to snatch it from me, but you know what? he looks so cute when he&rsquo;s annoyed, so&hellip;</p><p>As I learned how to fly, I took a flight&hellip;<br/>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t catch me Spid-urr-Man!&rdquo; I announced, giggling.</p><p><i>Thwip</i><i>.</i></p><p>He tried to wet my feet, but I dodged it.<br/>&ldquo;You said I was just doing 'decent&rsquo; in dodge skills&rdquo; I announced in a challenging tone, accompanied by chuckling as he was getting annoyed.<br/>He started shooting more webs, and I dodged them again.<br/>&ldquo;I told you so&hellip; &rdquo; I teased him.</p><p><i>Thwip&hellip;</i></p><p>And my feet got webbed.</p><p><i>Over-confidence&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.sucks!</i></p><p>The sudden jerk provided by his web, made me lose my balance in the air making me fall&hellip;&hellip;Fall on him.</p><p>He was lying on the floor with me on top of him, my hand still holding that brown paper bag of churros.</p><p>&ldquo;You think this is funny&hellip;?!&rdquo; he sniggered, facing me. <br/>&ldquo;I think it was&hellip;&hellip;Just look at your face!&rdquo; I burst out, laughing at seeing him on the ground with his curls all messed up, fighting for churros like a little kid. <br/>&ldquo;Oooh&hellip;! If that&rsquo;s what you find funny, then this is probably even funnier!&rdquo; He said, grabbing both of my wrists, flipping me over, so he was lying on top of me. He instantly started tickling me.</p><p>Oh god! Why am I so ticklish?!<br/>I was laughing uncontrollably, and he was giggling at the sight, continuously tickling me. At one point he finally stopped tickling me, rather pinned my hands down.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think now? Was it funnier?&rdquo;, he tittered. But in the next moment, his face wasn&rsquo;t funny anymore, he had a serious, 'lost somewhere&rsquo; kind of look as he stared into my eyes.</p><p>I noticed our position as I felt a knot forming in my stomach as his eyes were darting from my eyes to my lips. He was so close, I felt his breath hit my lips. It felt like the floor on which I was laying was burning, I could sense my palms getting sweaty.</p><p>I know he once said, Spider-Man liked me, but I didn&rsquo;t know he meant it this way. I thought he was just an innocent flirt. Was I imagining things? Or was he really leaning in? 4 years on Earth, the most crucial time of my teenage years were spent here, me busy in reading at least a thousand books just to understand this planet, me studying hard at school just to get the free scholarship, me tolerating my evil foster family, me trying my best to adjust myself to this planet. And now, I am here, with the person I never thought could become so important to me in my life, leaning in until our lips touched.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t say that it felt like firecrackers blasting inside my mouth, &hellip; it rather felt like everything was paused, like time stopped. I dropped the bag of churros on the ground, my body appeared to be paralyzed.</p><p>His lips felt like drugs as I felt euphoric the very next moment, unable to resist my own lips to move in sync with his as soon as the feeling of being frozen got away. My hands automatically roamed to his neck, wrapping around his neck as his hands left my wrist and travelled to my back grabbing my waist, pulling me closer. The kiss made me feel like I was craving it for so long, not even realizing it.</p><p><i>Was I in love with him, but just didn&rsquo;t realize it up until now?</i></p><p>But it&rsquo;s wrong! I haven&rsquo;t told him the whole truth about me yet! I can&rsquo;t cheat the person who cares for me more than anyone else, who loves me! It&rsquo;s absolutely wrong! I can&rsquo;t cheat him, by just telling him half the truth about myself or rather half a lie!</p><p>I pulled away, unwrapping my hands from his neck, signalling him to get up which he did. An awkward silence, more of a 'tension&rsquo;, surrounded the environment.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I-I&hellip;. got some work&hellip;&rdquo; I stammered at my words, trying to escape the awkwardness.</p><p>I was blessed I knew how to fly now, and I left without even waiting for him to say anything. Because I know that what just happened, shouldn&rsquo;t be happening! I am keeping him in shadows. I wished I could tell him the complete truth, but I don&rsquo;t wanna lose him. And I am sure he would hate me from the exact moment the truth gets revealed to him.

If that\u2019s what you find funny, then this is probably even funnier!\u201d He said, grabbing both of my wrists, flipping me over, so he was lying on top of me. He instantly started tickling me.</p><p>Oh god! Why am I so ticklish?!<br>I was laughing uncontrollably, and he was giggling at the sight, continuously tickling me. At one point he finally stopped tickling me, rather pinned my hands down.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think now? Was it funnier?\u201d, he tittered. But in the next moment, his face wasn\u2019t funny anymore, he had a serious, 'lost somewhere\u2019 kind of look as he stared into my eyes.</p><p>I noticed our position as I felt a knot forming in my stomach as his eyes were darting from my eyes to my lips. He was so close, I felt his breath hit my lips. It felt like the floor on which I was laying was burning, I could sense my palms getting sweaty.</p><p>I know he once said, Spider-Man liked me, but I didn\u2019t know he meant it this way. I thought he was just an innocent flirt. Was I imagining things? Or was he really leaning in? 4 years on Earth, the most crucial time of my teenage years were spent here, me busy in reading at least a thousand books just to understand this planet, me studying hard at school just to get the free scholarship, me tolerating my evil foster family, me trying my best to adjust myself to this planet. And now, I am here, with the person I never thought could become so important to me in my life, leaning in until our lips touched.</p><p>I won\u2019t say that it felt like firecrackers blasting inside my mouth, \u2026 it rather felt like everything was paused, like time stopped. I dropped the bag of churros on the ground, my body appeared to be paralyzed.</p><p>His lips felt like drugs as I felt euphoric the very next moment, unable to resist my own lips to move in sync with his as soon as the feeling of being frozen got away. My hands automatically roamed to his neck, wrapping around his neck as his hands left my wrist and travelled to my back grabbing my waist, pulling me closer. The kiss made me feel like I was craving it for so long, not even realizing it.</p><p><i>Was I in love with him, but just didn\u2019t realize it up until now?</i></p><p>But it\u2019s wrong! I haven\u2019t told him the whole truth about me yet! I can\u2019t cheat the person who cares for me more than anyone else, who loves me! It\u2019s absolutely wrong! I can\u2019t cheat him, by just telling him half the truth about myself or rather half a lie!</p><p>I pulled away, unwrapping my hands from his neck, signalling him to get up which he did. An awkward silence, more of a 'tension\u2019, surrounded the environment.</p><p>\u201cI-I-I\u2026. got some work\u2026\u201d I stammered at my words, trying to escape the awkwardness.</p><p>I was blessed I knew how to fly now, and I left without even waiting for him to say anything. Because I know that what just happened, shouldn\u2019t be happening! I am keeping him in shadows. I wished I could tell him the complete truth, but I don\u2019t wanna lose him. And I am sure he would hate me from the exact moment the truth gets revealed to him.

So I'm wondering how smart your Peter will be. Like, will your Peter be comics smart? Because if your Peter is as smart as comics Peter, that might make him on of the smartest people in the MCU. Like, without Dr. Doom or Reed Richard's, he'd be the 5th or 4th smartest person on the planet.",

So, Peter\u2019s as clever as you see him in the films. Which, you know, is pretty danged clever. How it would stack up against anybody else, I\u2019m not sure. Tony certainly thinks very highly of him, and gives him a lot that would require some real smarts to make proper use of.\u00a0</p><p>At the moment, Peter\u2019s really smart, but he\u2019s also quite young, so he doesn\u2019t have some of the emotional maturity and life experience. Those are factors that make him a fun character, too. He\u2019s impulsive, he cares, he wants to help, but he doesn\u2019t always really think things through. I think that\u2019s more towards the sort of thing I\u2019d play with. I wouldn\u2019t want to downplay his smarts, but it\u2019s just a part of the whole character, there.\u00a0</p>",
