Here where he kissed Lucas for the first time. Their dance in the dark, light flashing through the deep night.</p><p>Eliott let out a sob and buried his head in his arms, knees drawn up to his chest.</p><p>He should\u2018ve told Lucas about him being bipolar. He should\u2018ve told him from the beginning. But he was so afraid that this whole thing with Lucas would end before it even started. He lost his heart to the boy who was afraid of the dark. But now he lost the boy too.</p><p>He hasn\u2018t checked his phone since days. He didn\u2019t care about the messages, the phone calls. He didn\u2019t want to talk with anyone, he just wanted to be alone. His phone started to ring. Again and again and again. </p><p>Something inside him was breaking. Eliott took out his smartphone and threw it at the wall across from him, a scream clawing its way through his throat. He watched his phone shattering, finally not needing to hear this stupid ringtone anymore. </p><p>Lucas deserved way better than&hellip; <i>this</i>. He would have an easier and happier life without Eliott. And everything Eliott wanted was for Lucas to be happy. </p><p>Tears were streaming down his face as every moment with Lucas flashed through his mind like his own little cinema show. Only that this was the truth - he really lived that perfect life with that perfect boy for some precious minutes, hours, days.</p><p>And now he had nothing. Nothing left to care about. Nothing left to live for.</p><p>&ldquo;Eliott!&rdquo;</p><p>He even imagined his voice now. Eliott pulled his hood over his head, resting his forehead against his drawn up knees. He heard the voice again. And again.</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; just stop. Please. Stop this. Make it stop.&rdquo; Eliotts voice was barely audible, not even to him. Maybe he said it in his thoughts, not out loud. He was not sure. He was not sure of anything.</p><p>Suddenly a light was bursting through his darkness. Could it be&hellip;? Who would be at this place, at his shelter at this time?</p><p>&ldquo;Eliott!&rdquo;</p><p>And suddenly the light was directly on him. His heart stopped to beat for a second.</p><p><i>Not possible. </i></p><p><i>He didn\u2018t know I would be here. </i></p><p><i>How could he know?</i></p><p>More tears were streaming down his face. He felt so alone. He even imagined things which weren\u2018t there. He wanted to be alone. He wanted to be in his arms. He wanted to stop this thoughts. He wanted to&hellip;</p><p>Suddenly he felt warmth, a body right in front of him, someone breathing as if they had been running for quite a while now.</p><p>He wasn\u2018t imagining that. He couldn\u2018t imagine Lucas\u2018 scent that strong, couldn\u2018t imagine the feeling which rose inside him everytime Lucas was near him. His breathing picked up. Lucas was here. Here. To search for him. To find him. To safe him. </p><p>And then he felt his forehead against his own. He knew now that it was really him. That it was no ghost. That it was his Lucas. His mec. Eliott was shaking, slowly lifting his head, only to hear Lucas gasp as the other boy saw his tears. Eliott didn\u2018t want Lucas to see him like that and yet&hellip;</p><p>Lucas touched his chin, lifted his face, carefully stroking over his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;You\u2018re not alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliotts heart was racing and he couldn\u2018t stop the tears, couldn\u2018t stop crying.</p><p><i>I\u2018m sorry, Lucas.</i></p><p><i>I\u2018m sorry.</i></p><p><i>I\u2018m sorry. </i></p><p>So many things he wanted to say to Lucas be he stayed silent. He just moved ever so slightly towards Lucas as if the light and his warmth would pull him out of the dark place of his mind.</p><p>And slowly, so, so slowly Eliott was opening his eyes, directly looking into the blue pools of Lucas\u2018 eyes. He tried to draw them once but he couldn\u2018t find the right color. He would never find the right color for the beauty of Lucas&rsquo; eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I\u2019m here. You\u2018re not alone anymore,&rdquo; Lucas whispered and looked into Eliotts eyes. Eliott felt like a weight had been lifted from his heart. Lucas was here. Here. With him. And that was enough for this very moment. The flashlight from Lucas smartphone illuminated his face. His beautiful face. Eliott still cried. Lucas eyes were full of tears too.</p><p>But in this very moment, with the light shinging on Lucas\u2019 face and the tears in his eyes, Eliott saw an angel, pulling him out of the dark and into the light.</p>",
