            "description": "My Avatar is a screen grab of Marie I got from \nnghirgas' beautiful gif set :) I joined tumblr for Reylo though I do post some things for my other ships, which can be seen as controversial (Petyr x Sansa, Brienne x Jaime, Jorah x Dany). I don't do the Dark Side, though it can be fun to steal a peak sometimes, but I believe Love is a very powerful thing and can transform even the hardest of hearts and truly make a new creation so that is how I view my controversial ships in my own AU while still knowing and accepting the canon as it is. You are warned. I am a \"ship and let ship\" person so this is a judgement free zone, rudeness will result in being block - if you ever feel like I was out of line or rude myself you are free to PM me and let me know. My manips (like my header) can be found on welsharcher.deviantart.com, otherwise I just post my musings and reblog interesting takes and fanart.\u00a0",

The mother of dragons and the unburnt. The last born Targaryen. </p><p>\u201cWhat a waist of a good kidnapping. It so happens we were heading there ourselves.\u201d Tyrion said after a bit of laughter. You were still upset. You\u2019d always known where Lucia was, and when she was in the same room as you she was attached to you the entire time. You felt like you were missing a part of yourself. </p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>You felt empty. You didn\u2019t know what it was, you just did. Maybe it was the fact you were going back to the very place you had convinced your father to take you and your siblings out of. Maybe it was because you were leaving the place you had grown so fond of. Maybe it was because of Jon.</p><p>You were both going in very different directions. You, to the crownlands. Him, to as north as you could be without being in wildling territory. You\u2019d never see him again and it left a gaping hole in your chest. </p><!-- more --><p>He wasn\u2019t very tall, and even when he rested his face he still looked like he was brooding. And the way he held you. It made you feel safe. It made you forget the life you had in King\u2019s Landing. You weren\u2019t princess Y/N Baratheon of Westeros. You were just some girl in the north who had fallen in love with a bastard of a high lord.</p><p>A bastard who had stolen your heart and left with it. And you let him. Within a fortnight he became half of you. A half you never knew you needed. Now you&hellip; Were incomplete. </p><p>You were in the Riverlands. Far from Winterfell, and you didn\u2019t know if it was something you ate, but you felt ill. It was probably from being in the wheelhouse all day and night. So you\u2019d stopped for the night. </p><p>\u201cY/N? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine Tommen. I just&hellip;I don\u2019t feel well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to play swords with me? It always makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>You turned your head to look at your golden haired little brother and smiled before nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll win.\u201d You challenged and rushed out of the wheelhouse</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat business would you have with the queen?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes and looked over the edge of the boat into the water. You\u2019d never gone swimming, you were never taught. You\u2019d been kept inside with books and sewing. The only times you\u2019d ever come near water was to bathe or drink.</p><p>\u201cGold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you\u2019d ever met my sister, you\u2019d understand. \u00a0So, now that it\u2019s clear we\u2019re all on the same side&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Tyrion held out his hands which were still bound together. You looked from your uncle to the man. \u00a0He dropped his hands in his lap and thought for a moment</p><p>\u201cA highborn knight from the North of Westeros down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate-\u201c</p><p>\u201cJorah Mormont.\u201d You realized looking at the things Tyrion was pointing out. The things that were actually right next to you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Jorah Mormont! Weren\u2019t you exiled?\u201d</p><p>He remained quiet, sparing you an unimpressed look before looking back at the open water.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask, how exactly were you serving your queen in a whorehouse half a world away?\u201d</p><p>You looked from Jorah to Tyrion who sat looking exactly at Jorah. \u201cHe kidnapped you from you a whorehouse?\u201d You questioned</p><p>Tyrion just the same as Jorah spared you a simple glance before looking back to the older man \u201cIs it possible that you were running? Why would you be running? Why would she have sent you away. Oh wait, you were spying on her, weren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. Jorah Mormont. Not only was he an ex-slaver, he spied on the queen of Meereen. The woman who probably trusted him more than anyone. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all coming back to me. I was drunk through most of the small council meetings, but it\u2019s all coming back. You passed notes to Varys\u2019s little birds. She found out didn\u2019t she? Found out and exiled you. Now you hope to win back her favor with gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisky.\u201d You stated looking out at the land close by. She could decide to kill Jorah and imprison you and your uncle. Or kill the whole lot of you. You\u2019d heard of her kindness. But also how far she would go to prove a point. A Targaryen she was indeed.</p><p>\u201cOne might even say desperate. You think Daenerys with execute us and pardon you? I\u2019d say the reverse is just as likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt better be the more likely scenario.\u201d</p><p>Jorah looked at you curiously and asked \u201cWhy is that princess?\u201d The word princess came from his mouth like it was derogatory</p><p>\u201cIf I die, who takes care of my daughter? You? Varys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father.\u201d He suggested. </p><p>He really didn\u2019t know anything about what was going on in Westeros. He didn\u2019t know what Miza had spread throughout all the seven kingdoms just by telling the small council what you wanted said.</p><p>\u201cHer father is a sworn brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. He went there before she was born. He doesn\u2019t even know she exists.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>\u201cI know where we are\u201d Tyrion stated.</p><p>You looked to where Jorah and Tyrion where looking. You saw stone structures, battered and broken down from probably centuries of being there. The fog gave it cover from anyone who was too far away to look at it. You stood and grabbed onto the side of the boat looking at it</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking us through Valyria.\u201d</p><p>Valyria? where men and women with advanced greyscale where exiled to? \u00a0You didn\u2019t want to go through there. All the stories that you\u2019d been told as a child said that advanced greyscale was dangerous. You\u2019d lash out like an animal. What if you were all seen?</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you&hellip; Sailed this&hellip;route before?\u201d You asked turning to look at Jorah as he stood as well.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He replied with a stale voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case we\u2019re not enough?\u201d</p><p>You glared at your uncle and shook your head. He would say so many wrong things, all at the wrong time. You loved your uncle, of course. But gods was he frustrating.</p><p>\u201cI think you two will be plenty.\u201d</p><p>You sat down slowly still looking at the structures. The fog gave it a certain eeriness. You we\u2019re creeped out, and you\u2019d never wanted to be back in your room in King\u2019s Landing, in your warm bed with Lucia and you curled up playing.</p><p>\u201cThe smoking sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? For thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then they weren\u2019t\u201d Jorah finished. </p><p>The buildings were even creepier up close. You didn\u2019t know what to say or do. These structures once held some of the bravest men and women the world knew. Men and women who rode dragons and had some of the most outrageous laws that most people Westeros could agree was strange. </p><p>Children used to play here. They used to be scolded by their mothers and fathers. What you would give for Lucia to be able to enjoy a day outside without having to be afraid of her being taken from you.</p><p>\u201cAnd then they weren\u2019t\u201d Tyrion repeated.</p><p>\u201cTo think a volcano did this. Destroyed the entire city, killing most of the dragons. And only one family escaping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Targaryens.\u201d Jorah confirmed.</p><p>They had to have been quick. They would have had to grab their entire family and go all the way to Westeros from here. So far from home.</p><p>\u201cThey held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; the flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThe city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned\u201d</p><p>You watched as you came under an arch way of a crumbling building. You could practically see it. Dragons flying above with their children, families walking down a walkway together and dragon lords flying high above their heads in thick armor. And the buildings a lighter beige color instead of this dark grey they had become.</p><p>\u201cThe Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Jorah. His gaze was on your uncle as he sat and looked forward. You didn\u2019t know what it was about Jorah, but you were, very, very slowly beginning to grow fond of him. He spoke poetically. Much like Barristan Selmy had once. You remembered him still. Whenever your mother wasn\u2019t watching you or when Jaime and Robert wasn\u2019t he was. He was the King\u2019s guard assigned to watch you. And he told you stories of the mad king and how the Targaryens used to rule the seven kingdoms. He told you because you asked. Because he wanted to feed your curiosity.</p><p>Tyrion once again held his hands up where the rope was still tied and spoke \u201cI would clap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose this is it? This is all that remains of the Valyrians, except for a short woman in Meereen.\u201d</p><p>All was silent for a moment and then you saw it. A large creature in the sky. You could hear the flapping of it\u2019s wings as it flew above. A dragon with dark scales. He was huge. You could feel tears pricking at your eyes. So it was true? She did have dragons.</p><p> Tyrion stood as did you as you watched the dragon fly past you. The wingspan was giant. Bigger than what you\u2019d ever imagined from the stories you were told. You remembered how when you younger you had wished that just one dragon would be found, and that you\u2019d be able to keep it. You remembered your uncle saying he had the same wish as a child. But that your grandfather had crushed it early on. That at least your mother let you dream.</p><p>You heard a splash of water and turned your head, being caught by surprise. You could see the water ripple from where something had dropped in. Or someone.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Tyrion asked. </p><p>Jorah moved to try and see if he could catch anything that was important. </p><p>But you\u2019d never screamed so loudly when someone dropped down from above the archway. You were half convinced that the scream was louder than the ones you\u2019d let out when Lucia had been born. </p><p>You had fallen back, and began to push yourself into the wall of the boat. When he had stood up completely he began to make growling sounds. You could see his head was covered in almost grey like scales. </p><p>\u201cStone men!\u201d Jorah shouted to the two of you grabbing something from the side of you \u201cDon\u2019t let them touch you!\u201d</p><p>Jorah hit the stone man upside the head with it and began to fight with him.

Him, to as north as you could be without being in wildling territory. You\u2019d never see him again and it left a gaping hole in your chest. </p>[[MORE]]<p>He wasn\u2019t very tall, and even when he rested his face he still looked like he was brooding. And the way he held you. It made you feel safe. It made you forget the life you had in King\u2019s Landing. You weren\u2019t princess Y/N Baratheon of Westeros. You were just some girl in the north who had fallen in love with a bastard of a high lord.</p><p>A bastard who had stolen your heart and left with it. And you let him. Within a fortnight he became half of you. A half you never knew you needed. Now you\u2026 Were incomplete. </p><p>You were in the Riverlands. Far from Winterfell, and you didn\u2019t know if it was something you ate, but you felt ill. It was probably from being in the wheelhouse all day and night. So you\u2019d stopped for the night. </p><p>\u201cY/N? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine Tommen. I just\u2026I don\u2019t feel well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to play swords with me? It always makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>You turned your head to look at your golden haired little brother and smiled before nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll win.\u201d You challenged and rushed out of the wheelhouse</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cWhat business would you have with the queen?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes and looked over the edge of the boat into the water. You\u2019d never gone swimming, you were never taught. You\u2019d been kept inside with books and sewing. The only times you\u2019d ever come near water was to bathe or drink.</p><p>\u201cGold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you\u2019d ever met my sister, you\u2019d understand. \u00a0So, now that it\u2019s clear we\u2019re all on the same side\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tyrion held out his hands which were still bound together. You looked from your uncle to the man. \u00a0He dropped his hands in his lap and thought for a moment</p><p>\u201cA highborn knight from the North of Westeros down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate-\u201c</p><p>\u201cJorah Mormont.\u201d You realized looking at the things Tyrion was pointing out. The things that were actually right next to you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Jorah Mormont! Weren\u2019t you exiled?\u201d</p><p>He remained quiet, sparing you an unimpressed look before looking back at the open water.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask, how exactly were you serving your queen in a whorehouse half a world away?\u201d</p><p>You looked from Jorah to Tyrion who sat looking exactly at Jorah. \u201cHe kidnapped you from you a whorehouse?\u201d You questioned</p><p>Tyrion just the same as Jorah spared you a simple glance before looking back to the older man \u201cIs it possible that you were running? Why would you be running? Why would she have sent you away. Oh wait, you were spying on her, weren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. Jorah Mormont. Not only was he an ex-slaver, he spied on the queen of Meereen. The woman who probably trusted him more than anyone. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all coming back to me. I was drunk through most of the small council meetings, but it\u2019s all coming back. You passed notes to Varys\u2019s little birds. She found out didn\u2019t she? Found out and exiled you. Now you hope to win back her favor with gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisky.\u201d You stated looking out at the land close by. She could decide to kill Jorah and imprison you and your uncle. Or kill the whole lot of you. You\u2019d heard of her kindness. But also how far she would go to prove a point. A Targaryen she was indeed.</p><p>\u201cOne might even say desperate. You think Daenerys with execute us and pardon you? I\u2019d say the reverse is just as likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt better be the more likely scenario.\u201d</p><p>Jorah looked at you curiously and asked \u201cWhy is that princess?\u201d The word princess came from his mouth like it was derogatory</p><p>\u201cIf I die, who takes care of my daughter? You? Varys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father.\u201d He suggested. </p><p>He really didn\u2019t know anything about what was going on in Westeros. He didn\u2019t know what Miza had spread throughout all the seven kingdoms just by telling the small council what you wanted said.</p><p>\u201cHer father is a sworn brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. He went there before she was born. He doesn\u2019t even know she exists.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cI know where we are\u201d Tyrion stated.</p><p>You looked to where Jorah and Tyrion where looking. You saw stone structures, battered and broken down from probably centuries of being there. The fog gave it cover from anyone who was too far away to look at it. You stood and grabbed onto the side of the boat looking at it</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking us through Valyria.\u201d</p><p>Valyria? where men and women with advanced greyscale where exiled to? \u00a0You didn\u2019t want to go through there. All the stories that you\u2019d been told as a child said that advanced greyscale was dangerous. You\u2019d lash out like an animal. What if you were all seen?</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you\u2026 Sailed this\u2026route before?\u201d You asked turning to look at Jorah as he stood as well.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He replied with a stale voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case we\u2019re not enough?\u201d</p><p>You glared at your uncle and shook your head. He would say so many wrong things, all at the wrong time. You loved your uncle, of course. But gods was he frustrating.</p><p>\u201cI think you two will be plenty.\u201d</p><p>You sat down slowly still looking at the structures. The fog gave it a certain eeriness. You we\u2019re creeped out, and you\u2019d never wanted to be back in your room in King\u2019s Landing, in your warm bed with Lucia and you curled up playing.</p><p>\u201cThe smoking sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? For thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then they weren\u2019t\u201d Jorah finished. </p><p>The buildings were even creepier up close. You didn\u2019t know what to say or do. These structures once held some of the bravest men and women the world knew. Men and women who rode dragons and had some of the most outrageous laws that most people Westeros could agree was strange. </p><p>Children used to play here. They used to be scolded by their mothers and fathers. What you would give for Lucia to be able to enjoy a day outside without having to be afraid of her being taken from you.</p><p>\u201cAnd then they weren\u2019t\u201d Tyrion repeated.</p><p>\u201cTo think a volcano did this. Destroyed the entire city, killing most of the dragons. And only one family escaping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Targaryens.\u201d Jorah confirmed.</p><p>They had to have been quick. They would have had to grab their entire family and go all the way to Westeros from here. So far from home.</p><p>\u201cThey held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; the flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThe city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned\u201d</p><p>You watched as you came under an arch way of a crumbling building. You could practically see it. Dragons flying above with their children, families walking down a walkway together and dragon lords flying high above their heads in thick armor. And the buildings a lighter beige color instead of this dark grey they had become.</p><p>\u201cThe Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Jorah. His gaze was on your uncle as he sat and looked forward. You didn\u2019t know what it was about Jorah, but you were, very, very slowly beginning to grow fond of him. He spoke poetically. Much like Barristan Selmy had once. You remembered him still. Whenever your mother wasn\u2019t watching you or when Jaime and Robert wasn\u2019t he was. He was the King\u2019s guard assigned to watch you. And he told you stories of the mad king and how the Targaryens used to rule the seven kingdoms. He told you because you asked. Because he wanted to feed your curiosity.</p><p>Tyrion once again held his hands up where the rope was still tied and spoke \u201cI would clap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose this is it? This is all that remains of the Valyrians, except for a short woman in Meereen.\u201d</p><p>All was silent for a moment and then you saw it. A large creature in the sky. You could hear the flapping of it\u2019s wings as it flew above. A dragon with dark scales. He was huge. You could feel tears pricking at your eyes. So it was true? She did have dragons.</p><p> Tyrion stood as did you as you watched the dragon fly past you. The wingspan was giant. Bigger than what you\u2019d ever imagined from the stories you were told. You remembered how when you younger you had wished that just one dragon would be found, and that you\u2019d be able to keep it. You remembered your uncle saying he had the same wish as a child. But that your grandfather had crushed it early on. That at least your mother let you dream.</p><p>You heard a splash of water and turned your head, being caught by surprise. You could see the water ripple from where something had dropped in. Or someone.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Tyrion asked. </p><p>Jorah moved to try and see if he could catch anything that was important. </p><p>But you\u2019d never screamed so loudly when someone dropped down from above the archway. You were half convinced that the scream was louder than the ones you\u2019d let out when Lucia had been born. </p><p>You had fallen back, and began to push yourself into the wall of the boat. When he had stood up completely he began to make growling sounds. You could see his head was covered in almost grey like scales. </p><p>\u201cStone men!\u201d Jorah shouted to the two of you grabbing something from the side of you \u201cDon\u2019t let them touch you!\u201d</p><p>Jorah hit the stone man upside the head with it and began to fight with him. And you could hear more splashing into the water from more of them.</p><p>You looked around franctially before finding your sword hidden under Jorah\u2019s own gear. The holden hilt catching what little light you had. You grabbed it and held it in a ver defensive possession as Tyrion grabbed a crate and used it as a shield.</p><p>Jorah pushed the stone man into the water and grabbed you and Tyrion pushing you behind him to try and get the other one who had dropped onto the boat off of it. </p><p>\u201cCut me free!\u201d Tyrion shouted in panic. You hadn\u2019t had time to catch on to what he was saying. Standing there watch as Jorah fought the man off to even notice Tyrion yelling for you to cut him free. Until another one who had jumped into the water previously had climbed onto the boat.</p><p>Dropping your sword you cornered yourself with Tyrion at the back. You could face many things with a brave face. This wasn\u2019t one of them. The advanced greyscale making you even more afraid. In sword fighting people could touch your skin with their own without damning you to death. </p><p>The man was crawling towards you and Jorah then picked up his own sword and stabbed one of the men through the chest. </p><p>\u201cMormont!\u201d You and Tyrion both yelled as the man closest to you inched closer</p><p>He was soon practically in your face to the point where you and Tyrion just reacted and jumped into the water. </p><p>The problem with this? You didn\u2019t know how to swim. You never had. So when your body hit water and your dress soon flowed around you without the weight of anything it tried to float to the surface while you were sinking. You could feel water go up your nose and into your mouth. You held your breath and tried to kick to the surface. You could see your hair surrounding you and you could feel your chest start to burn from the lack of air and for the second time in the past two days, everything went black.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You could hear the sound of birds chirping and waves crashing against itself and onto wet sand. And very faintly could hear your name being called.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d You could make the voice out as Jorah\u2019s, but you could feel the sun against your eyes and you didn\u2019t want to open them.</p><p>The dress you had been wearing stuck to your body and your hair stuck against your neck and face.</p><p>Very slowly, you turned your head and felt sand against your cheek</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Tyrion called out.</p><p>You opened your eyes and looked up seeing them both standing over you with Jorah\u2019s hand on your shoulder firmly.</p><p>You sat up quickly and felt Jorah grab onto your back and help you sit up fully.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and coughed into your elbow before he helped you stand fully. \u201cDid any of them touch you?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head no feeling some water fling off of your chin. Looking at Jorah\u2019s waist you saw your own sword next to his. Something you were grateful for.

The mother of dragons and the unburnt. The last born Targaryen. </p><p>\u201cWhat a waist of a good kidnapping. It so happens we were heading there ourselves.\u201d Tyrion said after a bit of laughter. You were still upset. You\u2019d always known where Lucia was, and when she was in the same room as you she was attached to you the entire time. You felt like you were missing a part of yourself. </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You felt empty. You didn\u2019t know what it was, you just did. Maybe it was the fact you were going back to the very place you had convinced your father to take you and your siblings out of. Maybe it was because you were leaving the place you had grown so fond of. Maybe it was because of Jon.</p><p>You were both going in very different directions. You, to the crownlands. Him, to as north as you could be without being in wildling territory. You\u2019d never see him again and it left a gaping hole in your chest. </p>[[MORE]]<p>He wasn\u2019t very tall, and even when he rested his face he still looked like he was brooding. And the way he held you. It made you feel safe. It made you forget the life you had in King\u2019s Landing. You weren\u2019t princess Y/N Baratheon of Westeros. You were just some girl in the north who had fallen in love with a bastard of a high lord.</p><p>A bastard who had stolen your heart and left with it. And you let him. Within a fortnight he became half of you. A half you never knew you needed. Now you\u2026 Were incomplete. </p><p>You were in the Riverlands. Far from Winterfell, and you didn\u2019t know if it was something you ate, but you felt ill. It was probably from being in the wheelhouse all day and night. So you\u2019d stopped for the night. </p><p>\u201cY/N? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine Tommen. I just\u2026I don\u2019t feel well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to play swords with me? It always makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>You turned your head to look at your golden haired little brother and smiled before nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll win.\u201d You challenged and rushed out of the wheelhouse</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cWhat business would you have with the queen?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes and looked over the edge of the boat into the water. You\u2019d never gone swimming, you were never taught. You\u2019d been kept inside with books and sewing. The only times you\u2019d ever come near water was to bathe or drink.</p><p>\u201cGold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you\u2019d ever met my sister, you\u2019d understand. \u00a0So, now that it\u2019s clear we\u2019re all on the same side\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tyrion held out his hands which were still bound together. You looked from your uncle to the man. \u00a0He dropped his hands in his lap and thought for a moment</p><p>\u201cA highborn knight from the North of Westeros down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate-\u201c</p><p>\u201cJorah Mormont.\u201d You realized looking at the things Tyrion was pointing out. The things that were actually right next to you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Jorah Mormont! Weren\u2019t you exiled?\u201d</p><p>He remained quiet, sparing you an unimpressed look before looking back at the open water.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask, how exactly were you serving your queen in a whorehouse half a world away?\u201d</p><p>You looked from Jorah to Tyrion who sat looking exactly at Jorah. \u201cHe kidnapped you from you a whorehouse?\u201d You questioned</p><p>Tyrion just the same as Jorah spared you a simple glance before looking back to the older man \u201cIs it possible that you were running? Why would you be running? Why would she have sent you away. Oh wait, you were spying on her, weren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. Jorah Mormont. Not only was he an ex-slaver, he spied on the queen of Meereen. The woman who probably trusted him more than anyone. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all coming back to me. I was drunk through most of the small council meetings, but it\u2019s all coming back. You passed notes to Varys\u2019s little birds. She found out didn\u2019t she? Found out and exiled you. Now you hope to win back her favor with gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisky.\u201d You stated looking out at the land close by. She could decide to kill Jorah and imprison you and your uncle. Or kill the whole lot of you. You\u2019d heard of her kindness. But also how far she would go to prove a point. A Targaryen she was indeed.</p><p>\u201cOne might even say desperate. You think Daenerys with execute us and pardon you? I\u2019d say the reverse is just as likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt better be the more likely scenario.\u201d</p><p>Jorah looked at you curiously and asked \u201cWhy is that princess?\u201d The word princess came from his mouth like it was derogatory</p><p>\u201cIf I die, who takes care of my daughter? You? Varys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father.\u201d He suggested. </p><p>He really didn\u2019t know anything about what was going on in Westeros. He didn\u2019t know what Miza had spread throughout all the seven kingdoms just by telling the small council what you wanted said.</p><p>\u201cHer father is a sworn brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. He went there before she was born. He doesn\u2019t even know she exists.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cI know where we are\u201d Tyrion stated.</p><p>You looked to where Jorah and Tyrion where looking. You saw stone structures, battered and broken down from probably centuries of being there. The fog gave it cover from anyone who was too far away to look at it. You stood and grabbed onto the side of the boat looking at it</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking us through Valyria.\u201d</p><p>Valyria? where men and women with advanced greyscale where exiled to? \u00a0You didn\u2019t want to go through there. All the stories that you\u2019d been told as a child said that advanced greyscale was dangerous. You\u2019d lash out like an animal. What if you were all seen?</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you\u2026 Sailed this\u2026route before?\u201d You asked turning to look at Jorah as he stood as well.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He replied with a stale voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case we\u2019re not enough?\u201d</p><p>You glared at your uncle and shook your head. He would say so many wrong things, all at the wrong time. You loved your uncle, of course. But gods was he frustrating.</p><p>\u201cI think you two will be plenty.\u201d</p><p>You sat down slowly still looking at the structures. The fog gave it a certain eeriness. You we\u2019re creeped out, and you\u2019d never wanted to be back in your room in King\u2019s Landing, in your warm bed with Lucia and you curled up playing.</p><p>\u201cThe smoking sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? For thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then they weren\u2019t\u201d Jorah finished. </p><p>The buildings were even creepier up close. You didn\u2019t know what to say or do. These structures once held some of the bravest men and women the world knew. Men and women who rode dragons and had some of the most outrageous laws that most people Westeros could agree was strange. </p><p>Children used to play here. They used to be scolded by their mothers and fathers. What you would give for Lucia to be able to enjoy a day outside without having to be afraid of her being taken from you.</p><p>\u201cAnd then they weren\u2019t\u201d Tyrion repeated.</p><p>\u201cTo think a volcano did this. Destroyed the entire city, killing most of the dragons. And only one family escaping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Targaryens.\u201d Jorah confirmed.</p><p>They had to have been quick. They would have had to grab their entire family and go all the way to Westeros from here. So far from home.</p><p>\u201cThey held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; the flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThe city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned\u201d</p><p>You watched as you came under an arch way of a crumbling building. You could practically see it. Dragons flying above with their children, families walking down a walkway together and dragon lords flying high above their heads in thick armor. And the buildings a lighter beige color instead of this dark grey they had become.</p><p>\u201cThe Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Jorah. His gaze was on your uncle as he sat and looked forward. You didn\u2019t know what it was about Jorah, but you were, very, very slowly beginning to grow fond of him. He spoke poetically. Much like Barristan Selmy had once. You remembered him still. Whenever your mother wasn\u2019t watching you or when Jaime and Robert wasn\u2019t he was. He was the King\u2019s guard assigned to watch you. And he told you stories of the mad king and how the Targaryens used to rule the seven kingdoms. He told you because you asked. Because he wanted to feed your curiosity.</p><p>Tyrion once again held his hands up where the rope was still tied and spoke \u201cI would clap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose this is it? This is all that remains of the Valyrians, except for a short woman in Meereen.\u201d</p><p>All was silent for a moment and then you saw it. A large creature in the sky. You could hear the flapping of it\u2019s wings as it flew above. A dragon with dark scales. He was huge. You could feel tears pricking at your eyes. So it was true? She did have dragons.</p><p> Tyrion stood as did you as you watched the dragon fly past you. The wingspan was giant. Bigger than what you\u2019d ever imagined from the stories you were told. You remembered how when you younger you had wished that just one dragon would be found, and that you\u2019d be able to keep it. You remembered your uncle saying he had the same wish as a child. But that your grandfather had crushed it early on. That at least your mother let you dream.</p><p>You heard a splash of water and turned your head, being caught by surprise. You could see the water ripple from where something had dropped in. Or someone.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Tyrion asked. </p><p>Jorah moved to try and see if he could catch anything that was important. </p><p>But you\u2019d never screamed so loudly when someone dropped down from above the archway. You were half convinced that the scream was louder than the ones you\u2019d let out when Lucia had been born. </p><p>You had fallen back, and began to push yourself into the wall of the boat. When he had stood up completely he began to make growling sounds. You could see his head was covered in almost grey like scales. </p><p>\u201cStone men!\u201d Jorah shouted to the two of you grabbing something from the side of you \u201cDon\u2019t let them touch you!\u201d</p><p>Jorah hit the stone man upside the head with it and began to fight with him. And you could hear more splashing into the water from more of them.</p><p>You looked around franctially before finding your sword hidden under Jorah\u2019s own gear. The holden hilt catching what little light you had. You grabbed it and held it in a ver defensive possession as Tyrion grabbed a crate and used it as a shield.</p><p>Jorah pushed the stone man into the water and grabbed you and Tyrion pushing you behind him to try and get the other one who had dropped onto the boat off of it. </p><p>\u201cCut me free!\u201d Tyrion shouted in panic. You hadn\u2019t had time to catch on to what he was saying. Standing there watch as Jorah fought the man off to even notice Tyrion yelling for you to cut him free. Until another one who had jumped into the water previously had climbed onto the boat.</p><p>Dropping your sword you cornered yourself with Tyrion at the back. You could face many things with a brave face. This wasn\u2019t one of them. The advanced greyscale making you even more afraid. In sword fighting people could touch your skin with their own without damning you to death. </p><p>The man was crawling towards you and Jorah then picked up his own sword and stabbed one of the men through the chest. </p><p>\u201cMormont!\u201d You and Tyrion both yelled as the man closest to you inched closer</p><p>He was soon practically in your face to the point where you and Tyrion just reacted and jumped into the water. </p><p>The problem with this? You didn\u2019t know how to swim. You never had. So when your body hit water and your dress soon flowed around you without the weight of anything it tried to float to the surface while you were sinking. You could feel water go up your nose and into your mouth. You held your breath and tried to kick to the surface. You could see your hair surrounding you and you could feel your chest start to burn from the lack of air and for the second time in the past two days, everything went black.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You could hear the sound of birds chirping and waves crashing against itself and onto wet sand. And very faintly could hear your name being called.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d You could make the voice out as Jorah\u2019s, but you could feel the sun against your eyes and you didn\u2019t want to open them.</p><p>The dress you had been wearing stuck to your body and your hair stuck against your neck and face.</p><p>Very slowly, you turned your head and felt sand against your cheek</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Tyrion called out.</p><p>You opened your eyes and looked up seeing them both standing over you with Jorah\u2019s hand on your shoulder firmly.</p><p>You sat up quickly and felt Jorah grab onto your back and help you sit up fully.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and coughed into your elbow before he helped you stand fully. \u201cDid any of them touch you?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head no feeling some water fling off of your chin. Looking at Jorah\u2019s waist you saw your own sword next to his. Something you were grateful for.

The mother of dragons and the unburnt. The last born Targaryen. </p><p>&ldquo;What a waist of a good kidnapping. It so happens we were heading there ourselves.&rdquo; Tyrion said after a bit of laughter. You were still upset. You&rsquo;d always known where Lucia was, and when she was in the same room as you she was attached to you the entire time. You felt like you were missing a part of yourself. </p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You felt empty. You didn&rsquo;t know what it was, you just did. Maybe it was the fact you were going back to the very place you had convinced your father to take you and your siblings out of. Maybe it was because you were leaving the place you had grown so fond of. Maybe it was because of Jon.</p><p>You were both going in very different directions. You, to the crownlands. Him, to as north as you could be without being in wildling territory. You&rsquo;d never see him again and it left a gaping hole in your chest. </p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t very tall, and even when he rested his face he still looked like he was brooding. And the way he held you. It made you feel safe. It made you forget the life you had in King&rsquo;s Landing. You weren&rsquo;t princess Y/N Baratheon of Westeros. You were just some girl in the north who had fallen in love with a bastard of a high lord.</p><p>A bastard who had stolen your heart and left with it. And you let him. Within a fortnight he became half of you. A half you never knew you needed. Now you&hellip; Were incomplete. </p><p>You were in the Riverlands. Far from Winterfell, and you didn&rsquo;t know if it was something you ate, but you felt ill. It was probably from being in the wheelhouse all day and night. So you&rsquo;d stopped for the night. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine Tommen. I just&hellip;I don&rsquo;t feel well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to play swords with me? It always makes you feel better.&rdquo;</p><p>You turned your head to look at your golden haired little brother and smiled before nodding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo; You challenged and rushed out of the wheelhouse</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What business would you have with the queen?&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes and looked over the edge of the boat into the water. You&rsquo;d never gone swimming, you were never taught. You&rsquo;d been kept inside with books and sewing. The only times you&rsquo;d ever come near water was to bathe or drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you&rsquo;d ever met my sister, you&rsquo;d understand. &nbsp;So, now that it&rsquo;s clear we&rsquo;re all on the same side&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion held out his hands which were still bound together. You looked from your uncle to the man. &nbsp;He dropped his hands in his lap and thought for a moment</p><p>&ldquo;A highborn knight from the North of Westeros down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jorah Mormont.&rdquo; You realized looking at the things Tyrion was pointing out. The things that were actually right next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jorah Mormont! Weren&rsquo;t you exiled?&rdquo;</p><p>He remained quiet, sparing you an unimpressed look before looking back at the open water.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to ask, how exactly were you serving your queen in a whorehouse half a world away?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked from Jorah to Tyrion who sat looking exactly at Jorah. &ldquo;He kidnapped you from you a whorehouse?&rdquo; You questioned</p><p>Tyrion just the same as Jorah spared you a simple glance before looking back to the older man &ldquo;Is it possible that you were running? Why would you be running? Why would she have sent you away. Oh wait, you were spying on her, weren&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh shit. Jorah Mormont. Not only was he an ex-slaver, he spied on the queen of Meereen. The woman who probably trusted him more than anyone. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all coming back to me. I was drunk through most of the small council meetings, but it&rsquo;s all coming back. You passed notes to Varys&rsquo;s little birds. She found out didn&rsquo;t she? Found out and exiled you. Now you hope to win back her favor with gifts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Risky.&rdquo; You stated looking out at the land close by. She could decide to kill Jorah and imprison you and your uncle. Or kill the whole lot of you. You&rsquo;d heard of her kindness. But also how far she would go to prove a point. A Targaryen she was indeed.</p><p>&ldquo;One might even say desperate. You think Daenerys with execute us and pardon you? I&rsquo;d say the reverse is just as likely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It better be the more likely scenario.&rdquo;</p><p>Jorah looked at you curiously and asked &ldquo;Why is that princess?&rdquo; The word princess came from his mouth like it was derogatory</p><p>&ldquo;If I die, who takes care of my daughter? You? Varys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her father.&rdquo; He suggested. </p><p>He really didn&rsquo;t know anything about what was going on in Westeros. He didn&rsquo;t know what Miza had spread throughout all the seven kingdoms just by telling the small council what you wanted said.</p><p>&ldquo;Her father is a sworn brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. He went there before she was born. He doesn&rsquo;t even know she exists.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know where we are&rdquo; Tyrion stated.</p><p>You looked to where Jorah and Tyrion where looking. You saw stone structures, battered and broken down from probably centuries of being there. The fog gave it cover from anyone who was too far away to look at it. You stood and grabbed onto the side of the boat looking at it</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking us through Valyria.&rdquo;</p><p>Valyria? where men and women with advanced greyscale where exiled to? &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t want to go through there. All the stories that you&rsquo;d been told as a child said that advanced greyscale was dangerous. You&rsquo;d lash out like an animal. What if you were all seen?</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you&hellip; Sailed this&hellip;route before?&rdquo; You asked turning to look at Jorah as he stood as well.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He replied with a stale voice. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case we&rsquo;re not enough?&rdquo;</p><p>You glared at your uncle and shook your head. He would say so many wrong things, all at the wrong time. You loved your uncle, of course. But gods was he frustrating.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you two will be plenty.&rdquo;</p><p>You sat down slowly still looking at the structures. The fog gave it a certain eeriness. You we&rsquo;re creeped out, and you&rsquo;d never wanted to be back in your room in King&rsquo;s Landing, in your warm bed with Lucia and you curled up playing.</p><p>&ldquo;The smoking sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? For thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then they weren&rsquo;t&rdquo; Jorah finished. </p><p>The buildings were even creepier up close. You didn&rsquo;t know what to say or do. These structures once held some of the bravest men and women the world knew. Men and women who rode dragons and had some of the most outrageous laws that most people Westeros could agree was strange. </p><p>Children used to play here. They used to be scolded by their mothers and fathers. What you would give for Lucia to be able to enjoy a day outside without having to be afraid of her being taken from you.</p><p>&ldquo;And then they weren&rsquo;t&rdquo; Tyrion repeated.</p><p>&ldquo;To think a volcano did this. Destroyed the entire city, killing most of the dragons. And only one family escaping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Targaryens.&rdquo; Jorah confirmed.</p><p>They had to have been quick. They would have had to grab their entire family and go all the way to Westeros from here. So far from home.</p><p>&ldquo;They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; the flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned&rdquo;</p><p>You watched as you came under an arch way of a crumbling building. You could practically see it. Dragons flying above with their children, families walking down a walkway together and dragon lords flying high above their heads in thick armor. And the buildings a lighter beige color instead of this dark grey they had become.</p><p>&ldquo;The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at Jorah. His gaze was on your uncle as he sat and looked forward. You didn&rsquo;t know what it was about Jorah, but you were, very, very slowly beginning to grow fond of him. He spoke poetically. Much like Barristan Selmy had once. You remembered him still. Whenever your mother wasn&rsquo;t watching you or when Jaime and Robert wasn&rsquo;t he was. He was the King&rsquo;s guard assigned to watch you. And he told you stories of the mad king and how the Targaryens used to rule the seven kingdoms. He told you because you asked. Because he wanted to feed your curiosity.</p><p>Tyrion once again held his hands up where the rope was still tied and spoke &ldquo;I would clap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose this is it? This is all that remains of the Valyrians, except for a short woman in Meereen.&rdquo;</p><p>All was silent for a moment and then you saw it. A large creature in the sky. You could hear the flapping of it&rsquo;s wings as it flew above. A dragon with dark scales. He was huge. You could feel tears pricking at your eyes. So it was true? She did have dragons.</p><p> Tyrion stood as did you as you watched the dragon fly past you. The wingspan was giant. Bigger than what you&rsquo;d ever imagined from the stories you were told. You remembered how when you younger you had wished that just one dragon would be found, and that you&rsquo;d be able to keep it. You remembered your uncle saying he had the same wish as a child. But that your grandfather had crushed it early on. That at least your mother let you dream.</p><p>You heard a splash of water and turned your head, being caught by surprise. You could see the water ripple from where something had dropped in. Or someone.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Tyrion asked. </p><p>Jorah moved to try and see if he could catch anything that was important. </p><p>But you&rsquo;d never screamed so loudly when someone dropped down from above the archway. You were half convinced that the scream was louder than the ones you&rsquo;d let out when Lucia had been born. </p><p>You had fallen back, and began to push yourself into the wall of the boat. When he had stood up completely he began to make growling sounds. You could see his head was covered in almost grey like scales. </p><p>&ldquo;Stone men!&rdquo; Jorah shouted to the two of you grabbing something from the side of you &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them touch you!&rdquo;</p><p>Jorah hit the stone man upside the head with it and began to fight with him. And you could hear more splashing into the water from more of them.</p><p>You looked around franctially before finding your sword hidden under Jorah&rsquo;s own gear. The holden hilt catching what little light you had. You grabbed it and held it in a ver defensive possession as Tyrion grabbed a crate and used it as a shield.</p><p>Jorah pushed the stone man into the water and grabbed you and Tyrion pushing you behind him to try and get the other one who had dropped onto the boat off of it. </p><p>&ldquo;Cut me free!&rdquo; Tyrion shouted in panic. You hadn&rsquo;t had time to catch on to what he was saying. Standing there watch as Jorah fought the man off to even notice Tyrion yelling for you to cut him free. Until another one who had jumped into the water previously had climbed onto the boat.</p><p>Dropping your sword you cornered yourself with Tyrion at the back. You could face many things with a brave face. This wasn&rsquo;t one of them. The advanced greyscale making you even more afraid. In sword fighting people could touch your skin with their own without damning you to death. </p><p>The man was crawling towards you and Jorah then picked up his own sword and stabbed one of the men through the chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Mormont!&rdquo; You and Tyrion both yelled as the man closest to you inched closer</p><p>He was soon practically in your face to the point where you and Tyrion just reacted and jumped into the water. </p><p>The problem with this? You didn&rsquo;t know how to swim. You never had. So when your body hit water and your dress soon flowed around you without the weight of anything it tried to float to the surface while you were sinking. You could feel water go up your nose and into your mouth. You held your breath and tried to kick to the surface. You could see your hair surrounding you and you could feel your chest start to burn from the lack of air and for the second time in the past two days, everything went black.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You could hear the sound of birds chirping and waves crashing against itself and onto wet sand. And very faintly could hear your name being called.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; You could make the voice out as Jorah&rsquo;s, but you could feel the sun against your eyes and you didn&rsquo;t want to open them.</p><p>The dress you had been wearing stuck to your body and your hair stuck against your neck and face.</p><p>Very slowly, you turned your head and felt sand against your cheek</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; Tyrion called out.</p><p>You opened your eyes and looked up seeing them both standing over you with Jorah&rsquo;s hand on your shoulder firmly.</p><p>You sat up quickly and felt Jorah grab onto your back and help you sit up fully.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and coughed into your elbow before he helped you stand fully. &ldquo;Did any of them touch you?&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head no feeling some water fling off of your chin. Looking at Jorah&rsquo;s waist you saw your own sword next to his. Something you were grateful for. That he took his time to get a sword off of a ship while you and Tyrion were drowning.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys?&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion and Jorah both shook their heads and you nodded in response. &ldquo;When we go and see Daenerys, You are going back out and finding my daughter and bringing her straight to me, not through some gods forsaken ancient fallen city.&rdquo;</p><p>Jorah laughed and nodded &ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; Was his response as he helped you to your feet.</p><p>Very slowly you three and gathered wood for a fire as the sun was beginning to set. And you couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder, how was Lucia? You hoped to the old gods and the new that Varys made sure that she was safe.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a><br /></p></p>",
