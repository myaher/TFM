Jon gently puts Arya down, almost reluctuntly. he tucks an erand strand of hair behind her ear and touches her cheek softly. ignoring the crowd about them as they awkwardly fidget, he then turns to his little brother.</p><p>\"hello, Jon&rdquo; Bran&rsquo;s smile is sad, yet soft. </p><p>Jon covers the distance in two long strides. </p><p>&ndash;and, ok, Isaac is way too tall for this and Kit not enough, but in my head they&rsquo;re not, and so:&ndash;</p><p>he sweeps Bran up too, and swings him around, and kisses his head, and hugs him close as all the heartache and pain and <i>delight</i> wash over him.</p><p>Bran hugs back twice as tight. he shuts his eyes and burries his face in the fur of Jon&rsquo;s coat, and he lets himself be a boy that he had to forget how to be oh so long ago. he lets himself have this, just for a couple of heartbeats. maybe three. just three.</p><p>for three short heartbeats winterfell is not all covered in white. the wind still carries the scent of late summer in his memories, and Bran&rsquo;s ears prickle with the noises of friendly sparring and baby Rickon&rsquo;s high-pitched laughter. Robb and ser Rodrik are offering encouragements over the thunking of wooden swords, and their parents are just at the edge of his periphery, calmly seeing to the needs of those halcyon days.</p><p>He keeps his eyes closed for a heartbeat longer. </p></p>",

It has amazing moments including the battle of the Goldroad and the Dragonpit truce meeting. Compare to the first season, the special effects in Season 7 are better, thanks to the increased budget due to the show&rsquo;s popularity. It is interesting to see Tyrion&rsquo;s relationships with some characters. For instance; the continuing hostility in his relationship with Cersei, and his platonic bond with Jaime remained strong despite he killed Tywin and serving Queen Daenerys. I am glad they finally reveal that Rhaegar Targaryen is Jon Snow&rsquo;s father and Jon is the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne, despite Jon&rsquo;s parentage hasn&rsquo;t revealed in the books yet. <br /></p>",

As someone who is feminine, i find this kind of annoying because honestly femininity has nothing to do with how i feel about her. So here are my top five reasons for loving Arya Stark:</p><p><b>1. Her empathy\u00a0</b></p><p>\u201c<i>The bars were too narrow to pass a cup through, but Harwin and Gendry offered her a leg up. She planted a foot in Harwin&rsquo;s cupped hands, vaulted onto Gendry&rsquo;s shoulders, and grabbed the bars on top of the cage. The fat man turned his face up and pressed his cheek to the iron, and Arya poured the waterover him. He sucked at it eagerly and let it run down over his head and cheeks and hands, and then he licked the dampness off the bars. He would have licked Arya&rsquo;s fingers if she hadn&rsquo;t snatched them back. By the time she served the other two the same, a crowd had gathered to watch her. &ldquo;The Mad Huntsman will hear of this,&rdquo; a man threatened. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t like it. No, he won&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;\n- Arya V, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c\n\n<i>It was even worse than before; Lady Smallwood insisted that Arya take another bath, and cut and comb her hair besides; the dress she put her in this time was sort of lilac-colored, and decorated with little baby pearls. The only good thing about it was that it was so delicate that no one could expect her to ride in it. So the next morning as they broke their fast, Lady Smallwood gave her breeches, belt, and tunic to wear, and a brown doeskin jerkin dotted with iron studs. &ldquo;They were my son&rsquo;s things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He died when he was seven.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my lady.&rdquo; Arya suddenly felt bad for her, and ashamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I tore the acorn dress too. It was pretty</i>.&rdquo;\n- Arya IV, ASoS<br/></p><p><b>2. Her friendliness\u00a0</b></p><p><i>\u201c\n\nSansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with anybody. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher&rsquo;s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block.\u201d - </i>Sansa I, AGoT<br/></p><p>\u201c\n\n<i>Cat had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores. They bought clams and cockles from her, told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi. She never let that trouble her.

They bought clams and cockles from her, told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi. She never let that trouble her. Instead, she showed them all the fig, and told them they were camel cunts, which made them roar with laughter. Gyloro Dothare taught her filthy songs, and his brother Gyleno told her the best places to catch eels. The mummers off the Ship showed her how a hero stands, and taught her speeches from The Song of the Rhoyne, The Conqueror&rsquo;s Two Wives, and The Merchant&rsquo;s Lusty Lady. Quill, the sad-eyed little man who made up all the bawdy farces for the Ship, offered to teach her how a woman kisses, but Tagganaro smacked him with a codfish and put an end to that. Cossomo the Conjurer instructed her in sleight of hand. He could swallow mice and pull them from her ears. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s magic,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Cat said. &ldquo;The mouse was up your sleeve the whole time. I could see it moving.&rdquo;\n- </i>Cat of the Canals, AFfC</p><p><b>3. Her childishness&nbsp;</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know what a brothel is.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I do so,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an inn, with girls.</i>&rdquo;\n- Arya V, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;\n\n<i>You know the words, but you are too proud to serve. A servant must be humble and obedient.&ldquo;<br />\"I obey. I can be humbler than anyone<b>.</b></i>&rdquo;\n- The Ugly Little Girl, ADwD</p><p><b>4. Her leave-no-person-behind attitude&nbsp;</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to die, and the sooner he does it, the better for the rest of us. We should just leave him, like he says. If it was you or me hurt, you know he&rsquo;d leave us.&ldquo; They scrambled down a steep cut and up the other side, using roots for handholds. \"I&rsquo;m sick of carrying him, and I&rsquo;m sick of all his talk about yielding too. If he could stand up, I&rsquo;d knock his teeth in. Lommy&rsquo;s no use to anyone. That crying girl&rsquo;s no use either.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You leave Weasel alone, she&rsquo;s just scared and hungry is all.&rdquo; Arya glanced back, but the girl was not following for once. Hot Pie must have grabbed her, like Gendry had told him.&rdquo; - </i>Arya V, ACoK<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;\n\nShe would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, but she could not leave them. They were her pack, her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens. If the Mummers catch us, I&rsquo;ll tell them that I&rsquo;m Ned Stark&rsquo;s daughter and sister to the King in the North. I&rsquo;ll command them to take me to my brother, and to do no harm to Hot Pie and Gendry. They might not believe her, though, and even if they did &hellip; Lord Bolton was her brother&rsquo;s bannerman, but he frightened her all the same. I won&rsquo;t let them take us, she vowed silently, reaching back over her shoulder to touch the hilt of the sword that Gendry had stolen for her. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; - </i>Arya I, ASoS<br /></p><p><b>5. Her bravery&nbsp;</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;&nbsp;\n\nRobb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna, to show them their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. &ldquo;There are worse things than spiders and rats,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;This is where the dead walk.&rdquo; That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya&rsquo;s hand.<br />\n\nWhen the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb&rsquo;s leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. &ldquo;You stupid,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;you scared the baby,&rdquo; but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too.\n\n&rdquo; - </i>Arya IV, AGoT<br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;\n\n</b><i>She should be more frightened herself, she knew. She was only ten, a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind who would gladly cut off her feet. Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal. The rain had washed the guard&rsquo;s blood off her fingers, she wore a swordacross her back, wolves were prowling through the dark like lean grey shadows, and Arya Stark was unafraid. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she whispered under her breath, the words that Syrio Forel had taught her, and Jaqen&rsquo;s words too, valar morghulis.&rdquo; - </i>Arya I, ASoS<br /></p>",
