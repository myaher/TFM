But it was the only accurate descriptor for his current situation.</p><p>He found himself aimlessly wandering the streets of his hometown, his thoughts running wild. The sun was beginning to rise and illuminated Remus\u2019 path. It was only when he walked into a tree that he realised that he had strayed far from the pathway and into the woods surrounding his house.</p><p>He sat down against the tree, resting his head in his hands and sighing. His chest started shaking and the tears started spilling. How could he have done that? He really was a <i>monster</i>.</p><p>The sun slowly kept rising and he was soon unable to stand the light shining into his eyes. It was too cheery. Too happy. So he stood up and wiped the tears off his cheeks with his hoodie sleeve. Sighing, he apparated to the Potter\u2019s house where he knew his boyfriend was staying that summer.\u00a0</p><p>He knocked on the large oak front door and was met by a very sleepy and dishevelled\u00a0James Potter who was still dressed in light blue rubber duck pyjamas. It was nothing new for Remus to see, who saw the boy every morning in their dorm room for the past 6 years.\u00a0\u201cWhat&rsquo;s up, Moons?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI.. ah need Sirius,\u201d he said, wiping the last tear off his cheek. James looked up at his friend properly and saw how distraught Remus was. He nodded and opened the door wider for Remus to enter.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s still asleep. You know where his room is, right?\u201d James said. Remus shook his head in agreement and walked up the Potter\u2019s grand staircase. He walked down the elaborately decorated halls of the Potter manor\u00a0until he reached the room that he knew that held Sirius.</p><p>He opened the door quietly and looked in at his sleeping boyfriend. He sat down on the edge of the large bed and patted Sirius, gently waking him up.\u00a0\u201c\u2019ey Rems,\u201d he said sleepily.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night it was the full moon and I must\u2019nt\u2019ve\u00a0got out to the forest in time. When I woke up this morning all I saw was blood. There was so much Pads.\u201d he said, sobbing as Sirius wrapped his arms around him, pulling him into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI hurt my mum Pads. I\u2019m a monster. I hurt her and when my dad came down and saw, he couldn&rsquo;t look at me. I couldn&rsquo;t look at me. I can&rsquo;t stand myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, babe. It will be okay, okay? It\u2019s not your fault, and you are not a monster, okay? You can&rsquo;t control that part of you. I know you. You are not, and could never be, a monster to me, or to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost killed her.\u201d Remus sobbed.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn&rsquo;t your fault. It was the wolf side of you. Your human side couldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I love you.\u201d Sirius whispered to his boyfriend, kissing him on the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cYou&hellip; You love me?\u201d Remus asked, tears still streaming down his face.</p><p>\u201cI do. Because you\u2019re amazing and kind and you couldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly if you wanted to and you\u2019re the smartest nerd I know and damn is it hot.\u201d</p><p>He let out a laugh at the last part, smiling up at his adorably sleepy boyfriend. \u201cI love you too, Pads. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I love you to the moon and back and nothing will ever change that.\u201d</p>",
