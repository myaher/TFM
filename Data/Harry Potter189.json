For Canon AU week (edit <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-7sLPoyOAb_8noKxPQmUuA\">@snapeloveposts</a> forgot to tag !!) : </p><p>- According to Eileen Prince&rsquo;s parents, she decided to marry a french muggle only to annoy them. </p><p>- They weren&rsquo;t wrong. Eileen would agree. </p><p>- But if she had to be honest (which never happened nowadays), she did fall in love with Tobias. </p><p>- She loved his name, Tobias Rogue, an unusual name, old french name. She spoke french very well, she did have some ancient french ancestry. Tobias never really tried to pronounce her name right : Eileen soon became H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, and Prince in the french way. She loved it first. She hated it years after. </p><p>- She used to love how he knew nothing of magic, how he loved her without thinking about it. </p><p>- Then, she ended up pregnant. They couldn&rsquo;t decide on a french or an english name, so they called him Severus. A latin name, the kind of name wizards from all countries would choose - but Tobias didn&rsquo;t know that yet.</p><p>- In many ways, her flight to France was a middle finger to her parents, nothing more. Nothing serious. When they wrote her she wasn&rsquo;t their daughter anymore, it felt wrong. It was too much.</p><p>- But it was also too late. </p><p>- When she understood she could never convince her parents to take her back, she became bitter. </p><p>- She made a vow : his son will be everything she wasn&rsquo;t. A powerful, respected slytherin - not a depressed housewife in the french suburbs. </p><p>- They lived in what french authorities called a &ldquo;sensitive zone&rdquo;. Severus grew up between HLM, in a &ldquo;climate of insecurity&rdquo;, as french politicians would say.</p><p>- He liked it though. It was lively. Her mother hated living there, but they had no choice. </p><p>- She was pleased when Severus&rsquo;s magic appeared. Tobias wasn&rsquo;t. </p><p>- He felt without understanding it that his wife was distancing herself and his son from him. She was talking to Severus in english about &ldquo;wizards&rdquo;, and that was the only word he could understand. He still didn&rsquo;t speak of english, after so many years.</p><p>- Soon, he associated magic with english and England, &ldquo;ces conneries de sorciers&rdquo;, because Eileen only knew the british wizard society, and that was the only thing she talked about.</p><p>- Severus remembered, before he knew about magic, dinner conversations, when his mum will speak french with his dad. Sometimes, she will say something in english, and his dad will ask, amused, a translation.</p><p>- This time was gone. </p><p>- Now, his mother only spoke to him in english, using french as a bare minimum to adress his father. Tobias hated it, always thinking she was talking about some magic stuff in a language he couldn&rsquo;t understand, when she was just asking for the salt.</p><p>- But french was Severus&rsquo;s native language. He was dreaming in french. He was going to a french muggle school. And his english was good, excellent for a young kid, but it still wasn&rsquo;t his first language.</p><p>- She started to imagine him, eleven years old, lost in Hogwarts, rejected. She didn&rsquo;t even consider Beauxbatons : her son was going to be a Slytherin. </p><p>- He had to be excellent at english lessons : one mistake, and she made him work way past bedtime. He was soon bilingual, but it still wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p><p>- Some days, she wanted to obliviate french out of him. </p><p>- Severus was confused. He wanted to please his mother and his father at the same time, but it was impossible. When he blurted something in french in front of Eileen, she ignored him for weeks. When he said something in english in front of Tobias, he looked at him with hatred.</p><p>- Her mother sent him every summer since he was seven tears old to England, helped by the municipality, in a host family. </p><p>- They were called the Evans and they had two daughters. They were friendly, except Petunia, the eldest daughter, who didn&rsquo;t like him. </p><p>- Lily, the youngest one, revealed herself to be a witch. Eileen couldn&rsquo;t be more happy.</p><p>- He liked Lily, partly because she was nice and they could talk about magic together, partly because his mother was pleased when he talked about her. </p><p>- He was already seeing both of them in Hogwarts, sorted into Slytherin. </p><p>- His acceptance letter from Beauxbatons was a shock. </p><p>- Eileen went to Hogwarts, she cried, she threatened Dumbledore, but it didn&rsquo;t work. </p><p>- And Severus went to Beauxbatons. </p><p>- He could have liked it here, if his mother didn&rsquo;t criticize everything. </p><p>- &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have houses ? Pathetic. How do they call a rememball ? A &quot;Rapeltout&rdquo; ? That&rsquo;s ridiculous.&ldquo;</p><p>- He couldn&rsquo;t speak with her about school ; his good grades didn&rsquo;t matter much to her.</p><p>- His father treated him less like a son but more like a stranger.</p><p>- Even his summers wasn&rsquo;t fun anymore : Lily was talking about Hogwarts, about her friends, using magical words he only knew in french. His mother had convinced him he was in a school of very poor quality. He was jealous of Lily, he was dreaming about Hogwarts. </p><p>- When he came back to home at the end of his third year, his mother told him, as it was nothing, that his father died in a work accident two months ago.</p><p>- She &quot;forgot&rdquo; to write him about it. </p><p>- Tobias worked in a factory - it was plausible but he always wondered if Eileen had something to do with it. He knew better than to ask. </p><p>- He didn&rsquo;t like his father a lot, but he still felt sad. He wished he could have say goodbye, but they moved quickly to England. </p><p>- And he was transferred to Hogwarts for his fourth year. </p><p>- He didn&rsquo;t see Lily of all summer, but he met her on the Hogwarts Express. </p><p>- She was happy to see him, and to go to school with him, but she was a little worried when he told her he hoped to be sorted into Slytherin. She knew some mean guys in Slytherin &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re not someone like that, right, Severus ?&rdquo;</p><p>- A group of boys came to see them. A certain James Potter wanted to ask Lily to go on a date with him - it happened often, apparently. Lily refused, again. She didn&rsquo;t seem to like him a lot. </p><p>- James didn&rsquo;t like too much seeing a boy he didn&rsquo;t know talking to Lily Evans.</p><p>- &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my friend, Severus, she said. We met when we were kids ! He&rsquo;s from Beauxbatons.&rdquo;</p><p>- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a Slytherin, Severus added, feeling proud already.&rdquo;</p><p>- James Potter was not his mom, and he didn&rsquo;t like Slytherins. Neither his friends. </p><p>- Severus was indeed sorted in Slytherin, but he felt guilty when he realized he missed Beauxbatons. What would his mother think ? </p><p>- He was a brilliant student&hellip; in french. He was bilingual but he had to learn english magical vocabulary. It was frustating to have bad grades in subjects he knew he would have excelled in Beauxbatons.</p><p>- Being sorted in fourth years was weird. The only friend he had was in Gryffindor. Slytherins didn&rsquo;t know him, and at first, they kept their distance. He was alone. </p><p>- James and his friends started soon to bully him. It was easy : he had only one friend, he was in a school he didn&rsquo;t know very well, and Lily couldn&rsquo;t be with him all the time. No one could help him.</p><p>- After all, Lily had her own friends in Hogwarts. Severus was a &ldquo;summer friend&rdquo; to her.</p><p>- He worked hard and he became again a excellent student. At the beginning of his fifth year, slytherins started to accept him, mostly because he was always winning house points with his grades. His mother was proud, finally.</p><p>- When some slytherins talked about muggles, and how much they hated them, he thought of Eileen and Tobias first, then Lily. </p><p>- He loved Lily, but he wanted his mother to love him. </p><p>- He felt like a child again, trapped between Tobias and Eileen. </p><p>- In the end, the Shrieking Shack, then the &ldquo;mudblood&rdquo; incident made him choose. </p><p>- When he left Hogwarts, he was what his mother wanted : a brilliant Slytherin.</p><p>BONUS : <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fuser%2Flila.marietta%2Fplaylist%2F7goZ2lZSCPbnf1YCCwOLBk%3Fsi%3Do26ZAgPNT36T0G9Jgyh-sw&amp;t=N2IzNDVkZjQ1ODQxNjc1MDljNzNmMzVmZjMwZDJiYmNjZWYzZTY2NSxjZmRhNDAyMDQxYTZmNjIxOTc1MzYwZDQwNjQzNjU2ZTY5ZjM0OWRl\">a Rogue playlist. </a></p><p>(I&rsquo;m working on a sequel - Rogue as a death eater, then a teacher etc)</p><p>(Yes my english is bad you can read all of that with Fleur Delacour&rsquo;s accent)</p>",

For Canon AU week (edit <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-7sLPoyOAb_8noKxPQmUuA\">@snapeloveposts</a> forgot to tag !!) : </p><p>- According to Eileen Prince\u2019s parents, she decided to marry a french muggle only to annoy them. </p><p>- They weren\u2019t wrong. Eileen would agree. </p><p>- But if she had to be honest (which never happened nowadays), she did fall in love with Tobias. </p><p>- She loved his name, Tobias Rogue, an unusual name, old french name. She spoke french very well, she did have some ancient french ancestry. Tobias never really tried to pronounce her name right : Eileen soon became H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, and Prince in the french way. She loved it first. She hated it years after. </p><p>- She used to love how he knew nothing of magic, how he loved her without thinking about it. </p><p>- Then, she ended up pregnant. They couldn\u2019t decide on a french or an english name, so they called him Severus. A latin name, the kind of name wizards from all countries would choose - but Tobias didn\u2019t know that yet.</p><p>- In many ways, her flight to France was a middle finger to her parents, nothing more. Nothing serious. When they wrote her she wasn\u2019t their daughter anymore, it felt wrong. It was too much.</p><p>- But it was also too late. </p><p>- When she understood she could never convince her parents to take her back, she became bitter. </p><p>- She made a vow : his son will be everything she wasn\u2019t. A powerful, respected slytherin - not a depressed housewife in the french suburbs. </p><p>- They lived in what french authorities called a \u201csensitive zone\u201d. Severus grew up between HLM, in a \u201cclimate of insecurity\u201d, as french politicians would say.</p><p>- He liked it though. It was lively. Her mother hated living there, but they had no choice. </p><p>- She was pleased when Severus\u2019s magic appeared. Tobias wasn\u2019t. </p><p>- He felt without understanding it that his wife was distancing herself and his son from him. She was talking to Severus in english about \u201cwizards\u201d, and that was the only word he could understand. He still didn\u2019t speak of english, after so many years.</p><p>- Soon, he associated magic with english and England, \u201cces conneries de sorciers\u201d, because Eileen only knew the british wizard society, and that was the only thing she talked about.</p><p>- Severus remembered, before he knew about magic, dinner conversations, when his mum will speak french with his dad. Sometimes, she will say something in english, and his dad will ask, amused, a translation.</p><p>- This time was gone. </p><p>- Now, his mother only spoke to him in english, using french as a bare minimum to adress his father. Tobias hated it, always thinking she was talking about some magic stuff in a language he couldn\u2019t understand, when she was just asking for the salt.</p><p>- But french was Severus\u2019s native language. He was dreaming in french. He was going to a french muggle school. And his english was good, excellent for a young kid, but it still wasn\u2019t his first language.</p><p>- She started to imagine him, eleven years old, lost in Hogwarts, rejected. She didn\u2019t even consider Beauxbatons : her son was going to be a Slytherin. </p><p>- He had to be excellent at english lessons : one mistake, and she made him work way past bedtime. He was soon bilingual, but it still wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>- Some days, she wanted to obliviate french out of him. </p><p>- Severus was confused. He wanted to please his mother and his father at the same time, but it was impossible. When he blurted something in french in front of Eileen, she ignored him for weeks. When he said something in english in front of Tobias, he looked at him with hatred.</p><p>- Her mother sent him every summer since he was seven tears old to England, helped by the municipality, in a host family. </p><p>- They were called the Evans and they had two daughters. They were friendly, except Petunia, the eldest daughter, who didn\u2019t like him. </p><p>- Lily, the youngest one, revealed herself to be a witch. Eileen couldn\u2019t be more happy.</p><p>- He liked Lily, partly because she was nice and they could talk about magic together, partly because his mother was pleased when he talked about her. </p><p>- He was already seeing both of them in Hogwarts, sorted into Slytherin. </p><p>- His acceptance letter from Beauxbatons was a shock. </p><p>- Eileen went to Hogwarts, she cried, she threatened Dumbledore, but it didn\u2019t work. </p><p>- And Severus went to Beauxbatons. </p><p>- He could have liked it here, if his mother didn\u2019t criticize everything. </p><p>- \u201cThey don\u2019t have houses ? Pathetic. How do they call a rememball ? A \"Rapeltout\u201d ? That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201c</p><p>- He couldn\u2019t speak with her about school ; his good grades didn\u2019t matter much to her.</p><p>- His father treated him less like a son but more like a stranger.</p><p>- Even his summers wasn\u2019t fun anymore : Lily was talking about Hogwarts, about her friends, using magical words he only knew in french. His mother had convinced him he was in a school of very poor quality. He was jealous of Lily, he was dreaming about Hogwarts. </p><p>- When he came back to home at the end of his third year, his mother told him, as it was nothing, that his father died in a work accident two months ago.</p><p>- She \"forgot\u201d to write him about it. </p><p>- Tobias worked in a factory - it was plausible but he always wondered if Eileen had something to do with it. He knew better than to ask. </p><p>- He didn\u2019t like his father a lot, but he still felt sad. He wished he could have say goodbye, but they moved quickly to England. </p><p>- And he was transferred to Hogwarts for his fourth year. </p><p>- He didn\u2019t see Lily of all summer, but he met her on the Hogwarts Express. </p><p>- She was happy to see him, and to go to school with him, but she was a little worried when he told her he hoped to be sorted into Slytherin. She knew some mean guys in Slytherin \u201cbut you\u2019re not someone like that, right, Severus ?\u201d</p><p>- A group of boys came to see them. A certain James Potter wanted to ask Lily to go on a date with him - it happened often, apparently. Lily refused, again. She didn\u2019t seem to like him a lot. </p><p>- James didn\u2019t like too much seeing a boy he didn\u2019t know talking to Lily Evans.</p><p>- \u201cIt\u2019s my friend, Severus, she said. We met when we were kids ! He\u2019s from Beauxbatons.\u201d</p><p>- \u201cI\u2019m going to be a Slytherin, Severus added, feeling proud already.\u201d</p><p>- James Potter was not his mom, and he didn\u2019t like Slytherins. Neither his friends. </p><p>- Severus was indeed sorted in Slytherin, but he felt guilty when he realized he missed Beauxbatons. What would his mother think ? </p><p>- He was a brilliant student\u2026 in french. He was bilingual but he had to learn english magical vocabulary. It was frustating to have bad grades in subjects he knew he would have excelled in Beauxbatons.</p><p>- Being sorted in fourth years was weird. The only friend he had was in Gryffindor. Slytherins didn\u2019t know him, and at first, they kept their distance. He was alone. </p><p>- James and his friends started soon to bully him. It was easy : he had only one friend, he was in a school he didn\u2019t know very well, and Lily couldn\u2019t be with him all the time. No one could help him.</p><p>- After all, Lily had her own friends in Hogwarts. Severus was a \u201csummer friend\u201d to her.</p><p>- He worked hard and he became again a excellent student. At the beginning of his fifth year, slytherins started to accept him, mostly because he was always winning house points with his grades. His mother was proud, finally.</p><p>- When some slytherins talked about muggles, and how much they hated them, he thought of Eileen and Tobias first, then Lily. </p><p>- He loved Lily, but he wanted his mother to love him. </p><p>- He felt like a child again, trapped between Tobias and Eileen. </p><p>- In the end, the Shrieking Shack, then the \u201cmudblood\u201d incident made him choose. </p><p>- When he left Hogwarts, he was what his mother wanted : a brilliant Slytherin.</p><p>BONUS : <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fuser%2Flila.marietta%2Fplaylist%2F7goZ2lZSCPbnf1YCCwOLBk%3Fsi%3Do26ZAgPNT36T0G9Jgyh-sw&amp;t=N2IzNDVkZjQ1ODQxNjc1MDljNzNmMzVmZjMwZDJiYmNjZWYzZTY2NSxjZmRhNDAyMDQxYTZmNjIxOTc1MzYwZDQwNjQzNjU2ZTY5ZjM0OWRl\">a Rogue playlist. </a></p><p>(I\u2019m working on a sequel - Rogue as a death eater, then a teacher etc)</p><p>(Yes my english is bad you can read all of that with Fleur Delacour\u2019s accent)</p>",
